<LD>It's well over 90 degrees in Encino, but guitarist Steve Vai gamely
suits up in his bright yellow beekeeper jumpsuit and veil. Three days
ago, he was flying back from a performance in Japan. Today, two
newspaper photographers swarm around him as he pulls the yellow
sleeves over his tattooed arm. Nearby, TV producer Don Colliver fits
a veil over his head and tucks his jeans into his socks to keep out
angry honeybees. Inside, Vai's wife, Pia, oversees the bottling of
honey.</LD>
<LD>   It's honey harvest day at Vai's palatial home in the San Fernando
Valley (last year their harvest yielded more than 900 pounds), and a
team from "Celebrity Hobbies," a new show on cable's Do-It-Yourself
Network, has arrived to document this celebrity's beekeeping pastime.
Vai, 42, was a guitar prodigy who worked with Frank Zappa as a young
man, toured with the band Whitesnake in the 1980s and eventually
embarked on a successful solo career.</LD>
<TE>   The guitarist-turned-beekeeper has spent the better part of an
hour sitting on a stool in his guitar room sharing his six-year hobby
with the camera crew. Vai knows how to capture a swarm. ("Bang a pot
near the swarm until the queen lands," he said. The swarm follows.)
He knows the difference between English and Italian bees. ("Italians
are the best. They're so mellow.") He's enraptured by the queen.
("Honeybees have always seemed beautiful to me. If you look at their
faces ... with those big almond eyes.")</TE>
<TE>   A group of about 25 flush-faced friends with sticky fingers crowd
their kitchen and dining room, extracting the substance from
honeycombs and pouring it into bottles that will go out to Vai's
circle at Christmas or be auctioned off on his Web site to raise
money for charity.</TE>
<TE>   Vai leads the media out to a shady corner of his yard. "So here we
go," he says with a wave of his gloved hand.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is suited up, but the TV crew seems a bit nervous. It
hesitantly follows Vai to a cool patch under a giant tree, where the
bees live in three wood boxes that look like filing cabinets. "You
can get pretty close as long as you don't get in the flight path," he
explains. "Where is the flight path, Steve?" asks Colliver.</TE>
<TE>   The crew moves closer. The sound man detects a problem. "They're
not buzzing," he says. Vai pauses over the hive. He has played host
to the crew for well over an hour now. Everyone is sweating. He
offers his best explanation for the colony of Italian honeybees.
"This is really a very mellow hive."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood How-To</TE>
<TE>   On a recent night in Hollywood, Peter Bart,  Variety's editor in
chief, and Peter Guber, founder of Mandalay Entertainment, took the
stage to talk about show business and their new book, "Shoot Out"
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, 2002). The duo, who also teach a class at UCLA,
addressed about 100 people seated in a lecture hall on Sunset
Boulevard. "Shoot Out," they said, is a "how come" book, rather than
a "how to"--but "how to," as in how to break into the world of Guber
and Bart, was topic A for their audience at the event, sponsored by
the Harvard Independent Film Group.</TE>
<TE>   At times the talk resembled a class on the political economy of
Hollywood, as Guber, especially, lamented a lack of risk-taking in
the industry. "We know the aptitude is there," he said. "Where's the
attitude?" After all, he said, "we're in the emotional transportation
business."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of listeners, though, just wanted to be in business.</TE>
<TE>   "How can actors make themselves into a franchise?" one listener
inquired. (The two Peters offered no shortcuts. It takes talent, they
said.) In the lobby after the talk, several people took the
opportunity to introduce themselves with a quick pitch as they got
their books signed.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside, three Harvard graduates considered the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of dumb questions," said Cat Deakins, a
freelance photographer. "Definitely extension-school people."</TE>
<TE>   Her friends, Sandy Stringfellow and Milly Diaz, giggled. "It's
totally about networking," said Stringfellow. "Totally," echoed Diaz.
"That's what Harvard's all about: flagrant self-promotion,"
Stringfellow said.</TE>
<TE>   And Hollywood?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there's some of that: 'Could you sign my book, and by
the way, here's my script,' " she said. "Hollywood is the schmooziest
place I've ever been."</TE>
<TE>   At the reception, held across the street at Fabiolus Cafe, Arthur
Roberts had come with a producer friend who wanted to hobnob, Roberts
said. "I don't need it," he said, explaining he had 37 years of movie
and TV credits. "I'm just hanging out."</TE>
<TE>   As Bart arrived, he was quickly cornered by those wanting a photo
or seeking his advice. So what could he impart?</TE>
<TE>   "In so many ways, there's something impenetrable about show
business, and yet there are so many ways to penetrate it."</TE>
<TE>   Three New Yous</TE>
<TE>   More notes from the decline of the empire: ABC is looking for two
women and one man for "Ultimate Makeover," a new show that, according
to ABC.com, "will make dreams come true for three special people, and
will encompass plastic surgery by a prominent Beverly Hills plastic
surgeon, as well as the skills of a dream team of hair, makeup and
wardrobe people and personal trainers."</TE>

<LD>A MATTER OF DEGREES</LD>
<LD>   What Temperature Reveals About the Past and Future of Our Species,
Planet and Universe</LD>
<LD>   By Gino Segre</LD>
<TE>   Viking</TE>
<TE>   320 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "Rectal readings" is not a phrase encountered on the opening pages
of many books, but in "A Matter of Degrees," physicist Gino Segre
lightly informs us that in the human body "oral and rectal readings
differ," the latter typically exceeding the former by about one
degree. From this most intimate standpoint, Segre branches into a
wide-ranging discussion of temperature, examining the ways in which
temperature affects everything from animal physiology to the
evolution of life, from the functioning of our planet's atmosphere to
the life cycle of the sun and the history of the universe.</TE>
<TE>   Humans are exquisitely engineered to function at a specific
temperature, 98.6 degrees. If your body temperature rises by the
merest 2% you feel sick: "If it rises and falls by much more than 5%
you should consider heading for the emergency room," Segre writes.
Just why this particular temperature is a matter of much speculation,
but doing the math Segre explains that 98.6 degrees ensures an
optimal rate of heat dissipation under the conditions most likely
encountered by our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Were the primal
environment hotter, it is likely, says Segre, that so too would be
human body temperature.</TE>
<TE>   A significant part of our physiology has evolved to keep us at the
right temperature and Segre delivers a fascinating disquisition on
the physics of sweating: Want to know why you feel so exhausted at
that spinning class? On a stationary bike in a windowless room, there
is no airflow over the body, thus no evaporative cooling takes place
and you overheat. It isn't just you; even champion cyclists cannot
keep up the pace in such conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Physics is Segre's "family business." His uncle was the famous
particle physicist and Nobel laureate, Emilio Segre; his brother is a
physicist, so is his nephew, a bunch of cousins and his
father-in-law. Unlike many of his colleagues, however, Segre knows
how to communicate with nonspecialists, and this is one of the most
deft and accessible physics books I've read in a long while.</TE>
<TE>   Though humans have been measuring space and time for thousands of
years, no one attempted to quantify heat until the early 17th
century. "Temperature" is just a concrete measure of the intuitive
experience we call heat. While there appears to be no limit to how
hot things can get (in the final stage of a star's collapse the
temperature can reach billions of degrees), there is a limit to
coldness. Minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 273 degrees
centigrade is as low as the temperature scale goes, a point known as
"absolute zero."</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly is being measured by a thermometer? What is it
that increases when we heat a pot of water or forge a bar of iron?
Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries most scientists believed that
heat was some kind of substance that was destroyed, or used up, when
a body burned: "Phlogiston," they called it, from the Greek word for
"combustible." In the early 19th century, the great French chemist
Antoine Lavoisier demonstrated decisively that no matter was lost
during burning. Still, he and other scientists thought heat must be
some kind of fluid that became more concentrated when the temperature
rose.</TE>
<TE>   The signal achievement of 19th century physics was the development
of an understanding of heat as a byproduct of the mechanical motion
of atoms and molecules. Though the science of thermodynamics remains
perhaps the least glamorous branch of physics, it has impacted on our
lives probably more than any other. The laws of thermodynamics led to
insights about how to make more efficient steam engines, making a
foundation of the Industrial Revolution. Thermodynamics remains a key
science today; when designing cars and planes and computers, heat is
one of the biggest problems engineers must wrestle with. That's
because any time a machine does work, it generates heat, which needs
to be dissipated or the engine will overheat.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great insights of thermodynamics is that heat is just a
particular form of energy that can neither be created nor destroyed
but only transformed from one type to another (as when coal is burned
to generate steam that drives a piston and powers a weaving mill.</TE>
<TE>   The statistical approach to understanding heat and energy inherent
in thermodynamics infected other sciences as well; in biology it led
to a shift in focus from individuals to groups. An understanding of
heat flow is also critical for climate models. In a chapter on the
environment and the problem of global warming, Segre describes the
complex exchange of heat between the oceans and atmosphere. It's a
superb introduction to one of the most important issues of our times,
and for this chapter alone the book is worth its price.</TE>
<TE>   Segre's two final chapters deal with temperature in the
cosmological and quantum realms. For those with some awareness of
physics, these will be a highlight, especially the section on
approaching absolute zero. As the temperature is lowered toward this
nadir, bizarre effects manifest such as superconductivity and
superfluid flow, where a liquid can actually climb up the walls of a
container. The zero point itself is like the event horizon of a black
hole; here everything comes to a standstill. Beyond this there is
nothing.</TE>

<HD>In Defensive Maneuver, Parents Put Kids in Classes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the 6-year-olds face the mock assailant--a male self-defense
instructor in 40 pounds of protective body armor and a helmet--and
prepare to physically defend themselves. The instructor might get a
little aggressive, "actually acting like a bad guy, raising his
voice," said Perry Hauck, senior instructor for the Culver City
branch of Impact Personal Safety, an international program.</LD>
<LD>   "We scare them a little bit, and they get it that it's something
real ... though you don't want to traumatize kids," Hauck said.</LD>
<LD>   These kids, though, are probably already aware of the recent spate
of high-profile kidnappings, including the two teenage girls who were
kidnapped at gunpoint in Antelope Valley on Thursday morning. The
girls were rescued hours later. The media also have extensively
covered the abduction of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion, who was
snatched near her home in Stanton on July 15--kicking and screaming,
the way her mother had taught her. Samantha's body was found the next
day.</LD>
<TE>   Organizers of self-defense classes for children and teens say they
are now being flooded with calls from parents who want their kids to
learn verbal and physical tactics. Kids 6 and older practice
one-on-one with a padded assailant, kicking, punching, yelling and
using other tactics--similar to the ones taught to women in
personal-safety courses. The physical skills are not meant to teach
youngsters how to fight assailants, instructors said, but instead, to
help kids get away and yell for help.</TE>
<TE>   Though the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
recently urged families not to panic, saying abductions are "very
rare," parents still want their kids to know as much as possible
about physically defending themselves, Hauck said.</TE>
<TE>   At Impact Personal Safety, instructors want kids to learn while
"highly adrenalized," the way they would be in an actual assault. "In
all of our classes, students strike the mock assailant full-force,
including in the groin and head," Hauck said. "It's really important
that students, whether they're kids or women, have a sense of their
own physical power."</TE>
<TE>   Some parents don't believe there's anything that their 6-year-old
can do physically to protect themselves, said Lauren Hines, a
self-defense instructor based in Los Angeles and Lake Arrowhead. But
abductors typically "don't want that hassle" of a kid who
aggressively tries to get away with even simple tactics such as an
eye gouge, she said. "The eye gouge is a very powerful strike. Not
only is [the assailant] in unbelievable pain, but you've caused
bleeding so he can't see you." In addition to physical training, the
kids learn how to use their voices, set appropriate boundaries and
other skills aimed at giving them self-confidence for problems they
may be likely to experience, such as to ward off bullies, for
instance.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs make it a point not to scare kids. At Kidpower
Teenpower Fullpower, a nationwide program, instructors teach
"everyday safety skills," said Janice Flynn, director of the Greater
Los Angeles center, based in Granada Hills. "It's nonthreatening.
It's not scary. It's very matter of fact. It's just like brushing our
teeth. We never do anything scary." The center emphasizes that kids
should learn violence-prevention techniques from a very young age as
a "set of life skills children should have along with everything else
they're taught." Instructors work with children as young as age 4,
but physical training is given only to those who are 7 and older.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the West San Gabriel branch of the Los Angeles
Commission on Assaults Against Women held a free public self-defense
course for kids in Pasadena. More than 110 kids signed up, and 70 or
so more were put on a waiting list. The commission plans to offer
another such course, possibly at the end of August, for kids 4 and
older, said Denice Labertew , project director for the West San
Gabriel office.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, which is a nonprofit agency and rape crisis
center, has offered a kids' self-defense program for years, but when
word got out about the free event, "we got an unbelievable number of
parents calling, saying they desperately wanted their kids in this
program," Labertew said.</TE>
<TE>   During the course, which focused on assertiveness and awareness
training, 4- to 6-year-old kids also learned to punch and scratch,
practicing on mannequin heads and kick bags. Older kids practiced
evasive techniques with padded "assailants."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about being Superman," Labertew emphasized. "You're not
trying to fight the evil-doer. What you're trying to do is get
yourself safe and ... run."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate room, parents met with safety instructors about how
they could reinforce the training with kids at home without scaring
them. "We ask that they don't grab their children from behind and try
to make it traumatizing," she said, "but, 'Show Mommy what [you would
do] if something happened.' "</TE>

<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>From just inches away, the one question asked more than any other
about James A. Traficant Jr. seemed knowable:</LD>
<LD>   The hair--is it real?</LD>
<LD>   A vantage point a couple of steps above him at the Cleveland
courthouse made a close inspection not only possible but unavoidable.
Shellacked individual strands of gray and silver that not even gale
winds could budge. A hairline starting so far back that his comb job
went up and over like an awning, a feat of coiffure engineering.</LD>
<TE>   Conclusion--one widely agreed upon in Washington: The hair was
just too awful to be anything other than real.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   As if becoming only the second congressman expelled since the
Civil War era and being hauled away in handcuffs this week to serve
an eight-year prison term on federal corruption charges were not
ignominy enough came this news flash: It's a rug!</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff in Akron, Ohio, where Traficant was booked after his
sentencing Tuesday, said the toupee's existence came to light during
a routine search. Traficant, a former county sheriff himself, was
allowed to keep the hairpiece on for his booking photo at Summit
County Jail and while he awaits assignment to federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   But like Michael Milken--the junk-bond king turned convicted felon
whose shockingly hairless head was unveiled when he checked into
Federal Prison Work Camp in Pleasanton in 1991--Traficant, 61, will
soon go au naturel. Federal Bureau of Prisons grooming regulation
551.3 states in no uncertain terms: "Inmates may not wear wigs or
artificial hairpieces, unless medical authorization to do so is
approved by the Warden."</TE>
<TE>   So the plume-like hair, even more his trademark than his
30-year-old bell bottoms, denim suits and "beam me up" speeches on
the House floor, is almost certainly history.</TE>
<TE>   Which may simplify life behind bars for Traficant, who has bragged
in the past that he achieved his signature look by styling his hair
with a weed whacker--an item hard to come by where he is going. Just
one mystery remains unsolved. How could a man who has been married to
a hairdresser for 34 years end up looking like that in the first
place?</TE>

<LD>What Makes a Car</LD>
<LD>   Worth a Million Dollars?</LD>
<LD>   Ferraris and Lamborghinis are expensive cars and generally cost
more than a typical family automobile. But did you know that some
cars can be worth a million dollars or more? For that much money you
could buy nearly eight new Ferrari convertibles or four new
Lamborghini models. Why are car collectors willing to pay so much for
one automobile? Here are some reasons.</LD>
<TE>   * Rarity: This means there aren't many other cars like it. Only
seven Bugatti Royale models were ever built. Only six Shelby Cobra
Daytona Coupes were produced. Only three Mercedes 540K Special
Roadsters were ever constructed. With so few examples to go around,
and hundreds of collectors who would like to have one, the demand
drives up prices. In the case of cars like these, the prices can
exceed tens of millions of dollars because the buyer demand is so
great.</TE>
<TE>   * Significance: A "significant" car could be the very first of a
special series, or a car like Henry Ford's 1901 Sweepstakes Race Car,
which Ford drove to victory. Money won from the race was used to back
the launch of the Ford Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   * Provenance: This means the car has some history behind it.
People love to collect cars once owned or raced by famous people.
Many cars can reach the $1-million mark because they were once owned
by a glamorous movie or rock star, a king or president, or because
the car won a famous race like Italy's Mille Miglia, France's 24
Hours of LeMans or the Indy 500.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about why car collectors are willing to pay
such astronomical sums for certain automobiles, and even see some at
the Petersen Automotive Museum's new exhibition: "Million Dollar
Cars: The World's Most Valuable Automobiles," through Jan. 26. For

<HD>The Mob in Skating? Godfather, Where Are You?</HD>
<DH>Did a reputed Russian gangster, currently under arrest,
make the judge an offer she couldn't refuse?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY MCNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until this week, it was difficult to imagine the circumstances that
would bring the terms "organized crime" and "ice dancing" into the
same sentence. But the recent arrest of alleged Russian mobster
Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov on charges that he rigged two contests in last
year's Winter Olympics closed that cultural divide. Stories remarking
on the long arm of the Russian mafia were accompanied by winsome
portraits of figure-skating couples and, in print at least, the
disorienting image of the French Skating Federation rubbing shoulders
with Interpol and the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   The obvious joke was made almost immediately by DJs and late-night
comics. A figure-skating event fixed by the mob? Must be the work of
Hollywood's very own "gay mafia."</LD>
<TE>   Not unless they have an office in Uzbekistan, says U.S. Attorney
James Comey. Tokhtakhounov, a native of that country, was, they
allege, the brains behind a swap in which a French judge tweaked her
scoring to ensure that a Russian skating team got the gold and a
Russian judge made sure French ice dancers did too. The plan
worked--both the designated teams won. But the superiority of
Canadian figure skaters, who were awarded the silver medal, was so
obvious that an investigation followed almost immediately and led to
a confession by the French judge and her ouster, along with that of
the head of the French Skating Federation. The Canadian pair was
upgraded to gold.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its historic reliance on tulle, sequins and the music of
Andrew Lloyd Webber, figure-skating is not the Olympic Catholic
schoolgirl it once was. When Tonya Harding hired goons in 1994 to
take a baseball bat to competitor Nancy Kerrigan, the skating world
was revealed as just another stressed out, high-stakes athletic
world. Still, Wednesday's arrest of the reputed Russian gangster at
his resort home in Forte dei Marmi, Italy, seemed a baffling and
over-the-top end to the scandal. In the much-mined literary landscape
of organized crime, casinos, liquor, drugs, prostitution are the
standard purviews. Art theft, OK, but figure skating? What's next,
rigged bunco games?</TE>
<TE>   According to gangster watchers everywhere, nothing is off-limits.
Forget the family-honor imprint left by too many viewings of
"Godfather II." Gangsters are criminals; they're in it for the
payoff, however weird and petty.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a criminal mind, you engage in a lot of fantasies
because there is no limit to how you can make money illegally," says
Antonio Nicaso, author of "Global Mafia: The New World Order of
Organized Crime." Besides, he adds, the guy is Russian. "The Russians
have a completely different mentality. There are no rules, there are
no boundaries. Nothing is off-limits," he says.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nicaso, the current crop of Russian mobsters cut
their teeth on the Politburo. "They're used to bribing people, it is
just how they think. The government controlled everything, it used
the criminals as bodyguards and allowed them to run the black market.
The only people with any money when the Soviet Union fell were the
criminals. And they think that money can buy anything."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike older, more traditional crime families in Italy or the
United States, the Russian mobsters refuse to follow the time-honored
ritual of starting small, establishing territory, asking for
protection money, working their way up. Instead, Nicaso says, they
come into the U.S. and other countries and try to buy their way in,
going straight to law enforcement officials and politicians. "In this
way, they are less visible," he says. "And you have no idea what they
are going to do next."</TE>
<TE>   Not that organized crime is above putting the fix on sporting
events. College basketball, pro football, even. If
mobster-turned-evangelical Michael Franzese is to be believed, the
New York Yankees have been tempted and tainted by men in hats and
their dirty money over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not shocked, I'm not surprised," says Jerry Capeci, former
New York Daily News Gangland columnist and author of "The Complete
Idiot's Guide to the Mafia." "The mob, whether they're Italian or
Russian or Jamaican, whatever, will do anything if they think they
can make a buck and get away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he says, figure skating seems a bit odd for gangsters. "But
there have been reports of Russian gangsters trying to get involved
in the National Hockey League for years," he says. "The Gambino crime
family was involved in the boxing industry for years. Inevitably some
guy will think he can get away with something as high profile as the
Olympics." Well, hockey and boxing, yeah. Marlon Brando would sign
off on both of those. Harder to imagine him sitting through a
skater's interpretation of "Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong."</TE>
<TE>   But then Tokhtakhounov has a bit of a rep in the hair-spray and
eyeliner set--he is alleged to have rigged several Moscow beauty
pageants over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "The mob has always tried to control betting circles, to get an
edge by bribing players, or getting information about players so they
know the weaknesses," says Allan May, a crime historian who writes
regularly for AmericanMafia.com. Still, he concedes, "figure skating
is a little unusual. You tend to think more about rigged fights or
boxing," he said. "But the Russians are different from the Italians
in a lot of ways."</TE>
<TE>   The payoff in this case was not money so much as it was location,
location, location. According to the U.S. attorney's office,
Tokhtakhounov hoped to curry favor with French officials who would
then renew his visa so he could return to France where he had lived
for several years. "Goodfellas" meets "A Year in Provence."</TE>
<TE>   "Well it just goes to show you," says Capeci, "that even to
gangsters some things are more valuable than money."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>August is a fine month for literary quarrels.</LD>
<LD>   Heat sharpens tempers; leisure whets the appetite for diversion;
time hangs heavy on the Hamptons.</LD>
<LD>   And what looks to be this season's main event is definitely a
heavyweight match: Its English-born antagonists--Martin Amis and
Christopher Hitchens--are not only transatlantically acclaimed
writers but also close friends since their university days.</LD>
<TE>   "I met Martin in 1973 at Oxford and soon realized I had met the
friend of my life," Hitchens, an author, essayist and political and
literary columnist for Vanity Fair and the Nation, said this week. "I
fell in love, really. But even in love there's always a blemish. And,
indeed, he had very ordinary political opinions, really wasn't
interested in politics at all, actually. I just thought, here's
something I know about, and he doesn't." Amis, of course, has gone on
to become one of England's leading novelists, a formidable literary
essayist and the author of a memoir, "Experience."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the occasion of their discord is Amis' discovery of
politics as expressed in his recently released book, "Koba the Dread:
Laughter and the Twenty Million" (Talk Miramax Books). It is a memoir
in which Amis deploys recollections of his family and
friends--particularly Hitchens--to argue that denial and a willful
attachment to Marxism have led the vast majority of Western
intellectuals to ignore Joseph Stalin's crimes, the Great Terror and
its 20 million victims. The book includes an "open letter" to
Hitchens--who is made to stand as Exhibit A in the indictment--as
well as Amis' reflections on his children, his dead sister and his
father, the late Kingsley Amis, the novelist, poet and critic, who
died in 1995. The son now seems to confess that he failed to
appreciate sufficiently the rectitude of his famous father's own
migration from orthodox Stalinism to right-wing anti-communism.</TE>
<TE>   When, for example, Amis describes a public meeting in London at
which Hitchens spoke, he is repulsed by the laughter with which the
audience greets the speaker's allusion to "old comrades" and writes:
"What kind of laughter is it? It is, of course, the laughter of
universal fondness for that old, old, idea about the perfect society.
It is also the laughter of forgetting. It forgets the demonic energy
unconsciously embedded in that hope. It forgets the Twenty Million.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows of Auschwitz and Belsen. Nobody knows of Vorkuta
and Solovetski.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows of Himmler and Eichmann. Nobody knows of Yezhov
and Dzerdshinsky.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows of the six million of the Holocaust. Nobody knows
of the six million of the Terror-Famine."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchens is having very little of it. He has written a lengthy
essay--"Lightness at Midnight: Satlinism Without Irony"--for the
forthcoming Atlantic Monthly in which he dissects Amis' book with a
severity so thorough that it mocks the mere savagery of the usual
unfavorable review.</TE>
<TE>   After praising Amis as a writer who "has won and held the
attention of an audience eager for [his] synthesis of astonishing wit
and moral assiduity," Hitchens carefully enumerates the handful of
passages in which he finds virtue. Then: "Having called attention to
the splendors of this little book, I am compelled to say where I
think it fails. And by 'compelled' I suppose I must mean 'obliged.' "</TE>
<TE>   Among the observations that follow: "George Orwell once remarked
that certain terrible things in Spain had really happened, and 'they
did not happen any the less because the Daily Telegraph has suddenly
found out about them when it is five years too late.' Martin Amis can
be excused for coming across some of the above names and numbers
rather late in life, but he cannot hope to get away with accusing
others of keeping these facts and names from him, or from
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   According to Hitchens, "With infinitely more distress, I have to
add that Amis' newly acquired zeal forbids him to see a joke even
when [as Bertie Wooster puts it] it is handed to him on a skewer with
bearnaise sauce."</TE>
<TE>   Amis, Hitchens writes, is guilty of "solipsism" and of "insulting"
not only the memories of Stalinism's many heroic left-wing opponents,
but also history itself. "Hard work is involved in the study of
history. Hard moral work, too. We don't get much assistance in that
task from mushy secondhand observations...."</TE>
<TE>   The Atlantic's literary editor, Ben Schwarz, who commissioned
Hitchens' essay, said that "when he sent me the draft of the piece, I
was taken aback. I knew it would be a tough essay, but I was
concerned immediately that Hitch had written some of it in the heat
of the moment and would later think better of some of his remarks
about Amis. Several times, I asked him to reconsider various words.
He is a very careful writer. So, for example, while I think he is
correct in choosing the word 'solipsistic,' I thought his closest
friend might take offense at being described that way. I didn't want
to be the instrument of a breach between them."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz need not have worried--and that is one of this literary
quarrel's singular aspects. While both Amis and Hitchens are
unwavering in their differences over the points at issue, both
profess themselves equally resolved not to let it damage their
friendship. In part, this may have to do with the fact Amis shared
early drafts of his memoir with Hitchens, who reciprocated by giving
Amis copies of his review.</TE>
<TE>   All was in furtherance of a conversation that, Hitchens says,
began two years ago in--of all places--San Marino.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a conference on humor in the postwar English novel held
on the occasion of the Huntington Library's acquisition of Kingsley
Amis' papers," Hitchens recalled. "Martin and I were there and Martin
gave a reading and, then, announced that his future project would be
this. It made the audience slightly wince. To be frank, listening to
him announce his intentions was like watching an inebriated person
crossing a 12-lane highway. Martin is as deft and gifted as anyone I
know, and without that gift he wouldn't have made it to the divider.
It is a fairly heroic exaggeration to make the vast majority of
Western intellectuals complicit in Stalin's murders. It's not true,
even of the left.</TE>
<TE>   "I took him aside afterward and tried to tell him that the
playback he got from the rather good audience at the Huntington was:
'Who do you think you are and who do you think you're talking to? And
to whom do you think any of this is a fresh moral dilemma?'</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately," Hitchens said, "Martin didn't find the modesty or
the proportion to take on either question seriously. When I saw the
manuscript a year ago, I thought, 'Oh, dear.' We had quite a lot of
conversation. I said, 'Look, I don't want to say anything about
myself, though I do not recall things between us the way you do, but
don't do this to yourself or to your family.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him everything that I've said in the review--and more,"
Hitchens said. "I told him the book he'd written was sentimental and
trivial and uncomprehending to the point of being misleading."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Amis, who received the review's final copy only
Wednesday, says: "While I disagree strongly with some of things
Christopher has written, I defend with my life his right to say them.
I am not discomposed. I will argue through some of the points with
him, but I'll need to read it through again before we do that.</TE>
<TE>   "Christopher," Amis said, "objects, in part, to the entire premise
of the book, but it is my personal response to these questions and
events and is not meant to be panoptic. I have found my own way
through it. I'm sorry he does not like the personal stuff--objects to
it, really--but it's a memoir not historiography. It is written from
my peculiar slant and is not meant to be definitive."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hitchens insisted, "Martin fails heavily" and "has written
a book barely redeemed by its prose."</TE>
<TE>   "In effect, he calls me a Holocaust denier, which more than
slightly pisses me off. I was fighting against the Communist Party
and its thugs when I was 18 years old. I forgive Martin only because,
until two years ago, he wouldn't have known the difference between
Bakunin and Bukharin. I wouldn't take my oath that he even now knows
the difference," Hitchens said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our differences over these questions," Amis said, "are not a
personal thing. As much as possible I think they should be argued on
the merits and are detachable from my personal slant. Insofar as
Christopher's review goes, I thought it could have done with more of
a personal slant from his own point of view. I would like to have had
more of a sense of his personal history and of his period of
Trotskyist romanticism. It's something he ought to do at some point."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz and the Atlantic have offered to sponsor further public
debates between the two writers. Amis says he will decline.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a rash man, indeed, who went to the podium with him,"
Amis said of his friend. "I would rather our conversation go on in
private than from the podium...." In any event, Amis said, "There is
no question of a rupture between us nor of any fluctuation in our
friendship. With this book, I ventured rather far into his territory,
and I expected him to have much to say in rebuttal. From my reading
of what he has said, there is no malice in his response and, indeed,
there was none on my part."</TE>
<TE>   On this, Hitchens agrees. "There is no question of a breach in our
friendship," he said. "It would take a lot more than this from my
side. I think I've been slightly abused, but not betrayed. Martin
would have to do something very sordid for me to break our friendship
off. I suppose that if I'm one person involved with Marxism who he
has known well, that's simply a mark of his laziness."</TE>
<TE>   One can almost hear the connoisseurs of controversy sighing in
collective disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Michael Henry Heim, professor of Slavic languages and literature
at UCLA, is one of America's most distinguished literary translators.
His most recent projects include "My Century" by Gunter Grass and the
forthcoming "Diary of Kornei Chukovsky: 1901-1969":</TE>
<TE>   "At this moment I'm working on something I promised to finish by
the 31st of July, but I haven't quite gotten there. It is a new
translation of Chekhov's four essential plays, which are in
chronological order: 'The Seagull,' 'Uncle Vanya,' 'The Three
Sisters' and 'The Cherry Orchard.' I've actually been working on it
for more than 25 years. The first one I did was "The Three Sisters,"
for the Mark Taper Forum, in 1975. The other translations were
commissioned by American and Canadian regional theaters over the
years. In each case I worked with the actors, and now I'm making the
final revisions, annotating the plays and writing the introduction.</TE>
<TE>   "The introduction, in fact, is what has held me up. I'm trying to
show the interplay between the universal and the specific in the
plays. In other words, what makes the plays interesting and valid for
audiences today and what was specifically Russian, and now is only of
historical interest. I expect to finish within the next few days."</TE>

<HD>It's All That Exhaling That Draws Mosquitoes</HD>
<DH>The flying nuisances also prefer adults over children,
certain body odors and dark colors</DH>

<LD>What's worse than getting eaten alive by mosquitoes at the family
barbecue? Noticing that your brother-in-law, sitting right next to
you, is mosquito-free.</LD>
<LD>   The minuscule buzz-bombers are quite discriminating when it comes
to human targets, according to Theodore Andreadis, chief medical
entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in
New Haven. He notes, however, that the blood-snacking preferences of
mosquitoes are not well understood.</LD>
<LD>   A major attractant, according to Andreadis, is carbon dioxide, ,
which we're constantly exhaling in various amounts. That fact may
account for research that suggests that mosquitoes seem to be more
attracted to adults than children, because an adult is physically
larger than a kid and therefore is puffing lots more carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere. (But there is conflicting research on adults
versus children, Andreadis notes.)</LD>
<TE>   The carbon dioxide factor might also explain why mosquitoes are
more drawn to people when they're near domestic animals. Or this may
have something to do with the appeal of body odors. The bloodthirsty
bugs apparently are drawn to foot odor as well as a light layer of
sweat and higher body temperature--but not dripping sweat. Lactic
acid, secreted by the skin in varying amounts by different people, is
another lure. Dark skin and dark clothing are more appealing to the
critters than lighter skin and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   One new study from Japan may put a slight damper on certain kinds
of outdoor merrymaking.</TE>
<TE>   It suggests that people who drink alcohol attract more mosquitoes
than those who stay with soft drinks.</TE>
<TE>   It's all a bit up in the air, Andreadis said.</TE>
<TE>   There are clear variations among mosquito species. If you are a
chosen target, don't take those bites personally. Female mosquitoes
suck blood so that they can produce eggs. "They're just doing it to
sustain themselves," Andreadis said.</TE>

<DH>3rd Street boutique in L.A. gets a cameo in 'Full Frontal'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget product placement, store placement may be the newest in movie
marketing high jinks. Seaver, the boutique on 3rd Street in Los
Angeles, has a role in "Full Frontal," the Steven Soderbergh film
opening today.</LD>
<LD>   It's the Hollywood debut for the shop, but not for owner Nathalie
Seaver. She worked as a D-girl for five years and has been friends
with Soderbergh since he got his start directing the 1986 documentary
about the pop music band Yes.</LD>
<LD>   Seaver, a former vice president of original programming for
Showtime, gave up deal making for designing. Four years ago, she
opened the store to showcase her line of flouncy crepe skirts trimmed
with satin ribbon, hand-painted silk blouses and sophisticated
bias-cut dresses with a 1930s feel, all priced from $138 to $485.</LD>
<TE>   "I was always coming home working on my skirt projects, so there
was always that tug," said Seaver of her days in the film industry.
"It occurred to me that so many people would probably love my job,
and if I wasn't paying as much attention to it, I should probably
give up the mantle."</TE>
<TE>   The focus of her line was guided by a personal wardrobe need. "For
me, fun skirts were always missing from the market," she said.
"Skirts were either Lilly Pulitzer, which at the time wasn't cool, or
dowdy work wear."</TE>
<TE>   Without any training, she began producing below-the-knee crepe
skirts in whimsical polka dot, feather and floral patterns, some with
ribbon belts. Reversible silk georgette skirts, blouses with flippy
cap sleeves and T-shirts followed. Seaver also does custom work,
including bridal gowns.</TE>
<TE>   When she designs, she tries to consider all body types and ages.
"My clothes are not cut for a Barbie doll or a 12-year-old," said
Seaver, who refuses to disclose her age. "The 1930s really nailed it.
You didn't have to be rail-thin. I have wonderful archival books, and
even the dresses that people wore to clean their houses back then
were incredible. I'm going for that level of style."</TE>
<TE>   A collector of old quilts, she cites great fabric as the
foundation for her clothing, which she designs at a studio near
Little Tokyo. "I start with fabric and then figure out what to do
with it." She's more likely to read a design magazine than a fashion
magazine. "I'll see how a velvet drape hangs against a brocade pillow
and say, 'Wow, I can do something with this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Seaver has been craftsy since she was a girl, splitting her
childhood between Manhattan and France. At age 7, she made a pair of
disco ball earrings with two ping-pong balls, a bottle of glue and
some glitter. A friend's mother paid 50 cents for them. When she
wasn't buying clothes by the pound at thrift stores, Seaver was
rummaging through her grandmother's castoffs in the attic, and
altering them to fit.</TE>
<TE>   Her store is a bit like a boudoir with rich burgundy walls,
Oriental rugs, a day bed and vintage French movie posters. It's a
favorite with celebs such as Rose McGowan, Patricia Heaton, Allison
Janney and Susan Sarandon, who come for clothes and the large
selection of gifts, many French-themed.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh is also a regular, and Seaver was thrilled when he
suggested the store for a scene in his film. "A lot of the movie is
about real locations in L.A. that aren't so obvious," she said. The
director, who was too busy this week to talk about his friend, also
offered her a small role selling a dress she designed. Done in just
half a day, the shoot was a breeze. "After all," she said, "it was an
old friend, the crew was really nice, I was in my own environment and
[the role] wasn't much of a stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about being in the right place at the right time. And having
the right friends.</TE>

<TE>   Design Auditions</TE>
<TE>   The distinction between entertainment and fashion grows ever more
fuzzy now that another major store is offering to audition aspiring
designers.</TE>
<TE>   Following the lead of Henri Bendel, Saks Fifth Avenue is holding
Open See day at stores across the country in an effort to discover
emerging fashion designers. Saks representatives will seek women's
apparel and accessory designers at the San Francisco store on
Thursday; the Beverly Hills store on Aug. 10; and Miami and Atlanta
later in the month. For more information or to schedule an
appointment, call (212) 940-4255. Henri Bendel will have its Open See
Aug. 12 at the W Hotel in Westwood. No appointments necessary. For
information, call (800) H-BENDEL.</TE>

<HD>Rabbit Tale Isn't All Warm and Fuzzy</HD>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I recently purchased a nice sweater that I like
very much. The problem is, I noticed on the tag that the sweater's
main fabric is angora rabbit fur. How do they obtain this substance
to use in sweaters? I would hate to own a sweater that was made as a
result of cruelty to animals.</LD>
<LD>   --CONCERNED SHOPPER</LD>
<LD>   Dear Concerned: Thank you for thinking of our animal friends.
Angora rabbits, which have extremely soft, thick coats, are not
killed for their fur; instead, the animals are shaved or plucked and
the fur is spun to produce a very plush yarn fiber. However, there is
some debate about whether the methods used to get the fibers
constitute cruelty.</LD>
<TE>   According to a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals and several domestic breeders we spoke with, most of the
mass-produced angora sweaters sold in this country use fur from
commercial breeders in Asia and South America. Domestic breeders
usually raise rabbits to show or for their wool, which they use
themselves or sell to hand spinners or small manufacturers. English,
French, Giant and Satin are the four angora breeds most commonly
raised in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   PETA takes issue with foreign commercial breeders, says Lisa
Franzetta, the group's spokeswoman, because "the rabbits spend their
entire lives in wire cages, and their hair is removed by plucking or
shearing, which is done by strapping the rabbit to the table, and
it's struggling while it's being shaved. It's extremely stressful for
the rabbit, and it can suffer cuts and nicks, especially if the
shaver is inexperienced."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Turley is a breeder from California who has about 70
rabbits and harvests their wool to spin herself and sell to hand
spinners. Her rabbits, she says, live in temperature-controlled barns
outfitted with misters and fans, and kept in roomy hanging cages to
cut down on fleas and prevent the animals from sitting in their own
waste.</TE>
<TE>   Turley says she hand-plucks about 98% of her rabbits every five
months when they molt, or when the animal naturally sheds part of its
coat. The fur, she says, comes off easily and the rabbit isn't
harmed.</TE>
<TE>   She says that when shorn, each rabbit yields about 2 to 3 ounces
of fur, which typically sells for $5 to $8 per ounce. It takes about
6 ounces to make a lightweight shawl. Angora and angora blend
sweaters retail from about $20 to $200.</TE>
<TE>   "I've given demonstrations where the animal is just sitting in my
lap," she says. "If we don't harvest it, the rabbits are much like
cats and are fastidious about grooming. If they ingest the fur they
can die from intestinal blockage, so this is for their health too."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Huffman, president of the National Angora Rabbit Breeders
Club, which has about 500 members, says that at a world congress on
rabbits she attended about eight years ago "people were very
concerned about the rabbits' welfare. If you don't care for the
animal it's not going to produce the wool you need. I play with my
rabbits, I talk to them."</TE>
<TE>   Huffman, who lives in Oregon, also said that the NARBC polices its
members to make sure the rabbits are properly cared for, and will
intervene if the animals are being abused or neglected. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture regulates breeders who wholesale the
animals to pet stores, and will step in (with local authorities) in
the event of a disease outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of the Humane Society of the
United States, said angoras raised for fur are not covered under the
Animal Welfare Act and he knows of no other regulating agency.</TE>
<TE>   So there you have it. We suggest following your conscience on this
one.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few places have a lifestyle that requires a wardrobe not just to
match the climate but show off attitude as well. Parisians have the
beret and the scarf, while Santa Fe residents swish in broomstick
skirts and concho belts. In Malibu, the look revolves around blue
jeans, bikinis, clunky sandals, all filtered through the prism of
current fashion. While the beret and broomstick skirt remain
indigenous mostly to their native habitats, Malibu's look has come to
epitomize luxurious leisure of the West Coast and has spread
throughout international fashion.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't so terribly long ago that Malibu was the rustic outpost
for campers and beach bums who came for the beach and sunsets, not
Barolo wine and Marc Jacobs jeans. Fred Segal, whose boutiques have
become synonymous with hip L.A. style, hoped to preserve a little of
the cozy village feeling when, in 1973, he bought the 1920s-era
Malibu Colony Motel, a ramshackle building that had been converted
into apartments. Without hesitation, he described it as "a total,
rat-infested, scroungy, ugly eyesore."</LD>
<TE>   After two years of rehabbing, the property at 3835 Cross Creek
Road opened as the Malibu Country Mart, an open-air mall that's one
of the city's two main local shopping areas and includes a playground
and picnic area. In 1980, Segal developed more boutiques at 3900
Cross Creek Road, only to sell the properties late in the decade.
Retail rents, like prices for beachfront houses, have zoomed over the
years, from $200 a month for a snack stand to $3,000 now. The goods
on shelves went upscale along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu's merchants cater to their wealthy residents' worldly
tastes. Even the Ralphs supermarket is ultra-gourmet.</TE>
<TE>   Stores on the main shopping streets target mostly locals who
prefer $200 European walking sandals, $180 pre-worn jeans or $150
bras that seem to be sold in every boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists may happen upon the occasional sweatshirt that advertises
their trip to the coast, but more often, the goods reflect the
essence of Malibu's leisurely view of itself.</TE>
<TE>   Stay-at-home moms and trend-conscious teenagers keep the shops
busy all day. All that smog-free air must heighten residents' sense
of smell, because the stores offer what must be the region's highest
concentration of scented candles and perfumes.</TE>
<TE>   Most shopping in this beach enclave takes place either at Malibu
Country Mart boutiques, or farther up Pacific Coast Highway at Malibu
Colony Plaza, which is anchored by Ralphs and Wolfgang Puck's Granita
restaurant. Granita is just one of the area's well-known restaurants,
which include Geoffrey's up the coast, Saddle Peak Lodge in the
mountains and Nobu at Country Mart. While Malibu's look is worn
throughout Los Angeles, here the selection is so refined that
virtually any purchase will make you look like a tony local, even if
your address is miles inland. Even though clothing prices are
typically in the upscale-to-designer range--T-shirts are $50 and
jeans are $150--and markdowns are few, browsing the shops in the
cool, smogless ocean breezes beats breathing exhaust on the way out
of the mega-mall garage. Here's a sampling of what you'll find:</TE>
<TE>   Malibu Colony Plaza</TE>
<TE>   Theodore: Three Theodore stores separately offer men's, women's
and "Caribbean," that is, everything Tommy Bahama. The men's store is
the strongest, with a wide selection of leather outerwear, hemp
separates by 120% Cannabis, China Wall and the hot designers Roberto
Cavalli, Jean Paul Gaultier and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The women's store,
Theodore Beach, offers virtually every color and shape of Michael
Stars T-shirts, along with jeans by Crystal and Hippie. Theodore Man
(310) 456-5940; Caribbean (310) 456-0704; Theodore Beach (310)
456-7719.</TE>
<TE>   Philippe Derey: With some of the friendliest service in all of
Malibu, the boutique also entices with moderately priced casual looks
and sportswear from Three Dots, Just Cavalli, Urchin and Petro
Zillia. (310) 317-0944.</TE>
<TE>   La Chaussure: Owner Maxine Geyer has an instinct for feet, and the
shoes that fit them as seen in her compact but well-edited mostly
women's shoe store. She stocks hard-to-find Donald J. Pliner styles,
along with Cole Haan, Taryn Rose, Charles Jourdan, Donna Karan and
Arche, as well as fun handbags. (310) 456-8278.</TE>
<TE>   Becker Surfboards: Surf wear may be all the rage inland, but here
it's the real thing. Buy Becker boards, skateboards, wetsuits and the
rest of the requisite gear. For fashion, there's Roxy for girls,
Becca swimwear, Paul Frank accessories, tons of Hawaiian shirts and
Quiksilver sportswear. (310) 456-7155.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu Country Mart</TE>
<TE>   and Cross Creek Plaza</TE>
<TE>   Comfort Shoe Co.: : Ease and comfort are key to the Malibu
lifestyle, and the variety of stylish footwear here is vast. Unusual
styles from Birkenstock, Arcus, Think! and other brands give low

<LD>Jason ran and got his bike. He and Pete headed to the park. After
spending so much time in Mrs. Crabb's dark house, it was great being
out in the sun again.</LD>
<LD>   "At camp I rode a horse and paddled a canoe," Pete shouted as they
raced along. "I learned to swan dive and make a fire without using
matches."</LD>
<LD>   "Cool," said Jason.</LD>
<TE>   "I slept in a tent with five other guys and we threw pillows at
anyone who snored. We went on an overnight hike and sat up late
telling ghost stories."</TE>
<TE>   "Camp sounds like fun," Jason said.</TE>
<TE>   When they got to the park they threw themselves down on a shady
patch of grass.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, camp's fun, but it's great to be home," Pete said. He slid
a glance toward Jason. "How come you were in Old Crabby's house?"</TE>
<TE>   "She's old but she's not crabby," Jason said. For a moment he
remembered how sad she looked when he left.</TE>
<TE>   "OK ... so. What were you doing in there?"</TE>
<TE>   Jason pulled a blade of grass through his fingers and began to
nibble on it. "I was having a piano lesson," he said in a low voice.</TE>
<TE>   Pete sat up. "A piano lesson! Borrrring!"</TE>
<TE>   Jason looked away. "Not really."</TE>
<TE>   Pete jumped to his feet. "Now that I'm home you won't have to do
that geeky stuff anymore. How about if we go swimming, then afterward
we can play games on my computer? And there's neat stuff on
television we can watch."</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds good," Jason said. "But ...," he paused.</TE>
<TE>   He remembered the hours he spent polishing the piano's gleaming
wood. He thought of the silvery sounds it made when he struck the
right keys. He thought of Mrs. Crabb's voice saying, "Good work,
Jason."</TE>
<TE>   He climbed back on his bike and stood astride, balancing with a
foot on each side. "I'm really glad you're back from camp, Pete.
Honest. And we can do a lot of things together like you said."</TE>
<TE>   He waited until Pete picked up his bike and together they pushed
off.</TE>
<TE>   Pedaling along single file, Jason called back, "We can do stuff
afternoons or evenings. But I'll be busy mornings. Mornings are when
I have my piano lessons."</TE>

<HD>From Private Grief Comes a Public Memorial in Glass</HD>
<DH>Art* After Sept. 11, artist William Morris felt compelled
to extend his deeply personal tribute to his mother into 'Cinerary
Urns' for the victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONJA BARISIC</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NORFOLK, Va.</DL>
<LD>Glass artist William Morris didn't set out to make a statement when
he began creating a series of cremation urns.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't even think he would mount an exhibition. The project was
intensely personal.</LD>
<LD>   His mother, who was in her 80s, died a year ago, and Morris'
sister asked him to create an urn to hold their mother's ashes. A
couple of friends and mentors then died, and Morris also made glass
urns for them.</LD>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11, and Morris felt compelled to keep working in
the form as he, and the nation, dealt with more grief and death after
terrorist attacks. As the body of work accumulated, Morris decided to
share the pieces with the public.</TE>
<TE>   He offered Norfolk's Chrysler Museum of Art, where he had staged a
show in 1999, the chance this summer to premiere "Cinerary Urns."</TE>
<TE>   The nearly 70 vessels in the collection are arranged in niches in
a tomb-like, 20-foot-square space. Using dim lighting with occasional
bright highlights that set off the rich blues, reds, yellows, browns
and greens of the urns, exhibition designer Graham Graham created a
hushed mood that encourages contemplation and reflection.</TE>
<TE>   "This piece is for the mind to stop--a resting place for the
mind," Morris said in an interview from his home in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling with the vast concept of death, the mind becomes
overactive, demanding to know where, how and why, he explained.</TE>
<TE>   "The mind requires answers and these are answers that can't be
given," he said. "If the mind is off wandering and traveling in an
incessant, never-ending quest for information, where does that leave
the soul? The soul requires more than ruminations.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to put words to everything, thoughts to everything. It's a
very, very puny outcome, in my belief. The soul is infinite. The mind
is very finite."</TE>
<TE>   Creating the urn for his mother quieted Morris' own mind, giving
him a tangible task and a focal point for his emotions as he mourned.</TE>
<TE>   "As I was making it, I realized how much this object meant
something different to me than any other object I had made before,"
Morris said. "I found myself connecting with this object on a deeper
level rather than such a cerebral level."</TE>
<TE>   That initial urn was inspired by a 100-year-old object Morris
keeps in his kitchen: an African jar, fashioned from a gourd and a
wooden lid, that was used to collect cattle's blood and milk for
drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "The urn was simple in its presence and function," Morris wrote in
a statement about the exhibition. "The true power was in its ability
to become the vehicle through which the realm of the unknown is
revealed.... As a Shoshone Medicine Man asked, 'If the dead be truly
dead, why should they still be walking in my heart?' "</TE>
<TE>   The urns in the exhibition are similar to his mother's urn--simple
in shape but with refined textures and patterns--yet no two are
alike. All the lids are attached with unique handcrafted closures
created by fiber artists hired by Morris. Four of the urns, larger
than the rest, are inscribed "Sept. 11, 2001."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition opened June 28 and will run through Jan. 5. It will
close temporarily Aug. 19 to make room for a previously scheduled
exhibition, and move to another location in the museum. It re-opens
in late August or early September.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Norfolk, "Cinerary Urns" will travel to New York
City, where it will be shown at the American Craft Museum from Jan.
17 through June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Chrysler is showing "Cinerary Urns" in conjunction with a
dozen figures from Morris' "Man Adorned" series. The warriors,
medicine men and other native figures invoke the cultural heritage of
Asia, Africa and the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Those sculptures, some reaching more than 7 feet, demonstrate
Morris' ability to make glass look like other materials: leather,
bone, clay, stone, even feathers. He colors his pieces by rolling
clear molten glass into crushed colored glass.</TE>
<TE>   Morris is a virtuoso, adept at blowing glass into vessels as well
as working hot glass into solid pieces, said Chrysler glass curator
Gary Baker.</TE>
<TE>   With the urns, Morris has taken glass beyond ornamentation, Baker
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, glass has been decorative, and artists haven't
really used it to say that much," Baker said. "This communicates
meaning. It really is intended as a vehicle for contemplation as a
whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as a memento mori [an object serving as a reminder of
death] for our time and also as a requiem in glass for the victims of
Sept. 11."</TE>

<HD>KCBS, KCAL Will Share Some Network Shows in Prime Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Management of Viacom's recently merged KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV announced
plans Thursday for an unprecedented sharing between the two local
stations, in which KCAL would serve as a satellite for CBS shows
airing on KCBS.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new arrangement, CBS shows airing in prime time on KCBS
that might get postponed or preempted by special programming can now
air on KCAL, said Don Corsini, general manager of the two stations.</LD>
<LD>   The plan will first be used on Aug. 9, when KCBS will air a
preseason Oakland Raiders game starting at 6 p.m. Ordinarily, the
game would preempt KCBS' regularly scheduled 8 p.m. broadcast of CBS'
"48 Hours." But KCAL will broadcast the newsmagazine that night in
its regular time slot.</LD>
<TE>   Another switch will take place Aug. 24 with the KCBS broadcast of
another Raiders game starting at 6 p.m. "Big Brother 3," which would
normally air on KCBS at 8 p.m., will air on KCAL at that time.</TE>
<TE>   And the Sept. 18 installment of "Big Brother 3" leading up to the
season finale will air on KCAL at 8 p.m.; KCBS that night will show a
special "Countdown to the Latin Grammys" at 8, leading to the awards
telecast at 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers will be informed of the changes through on-air advisories,
commercials and Web sites. Still to be determined is how advertisers
buying time on KCBS will react to being switched from the network
station to KCAL.</TE>
<TE>   "Prime time is offering us some great opportunities for this
duopoly," Corsini said. "There are chances not only
cross-promotionally but also that will provide pure synergy."</TE>
<TE>   Other sharing between the two stations is also planned. In
September, KCAL will start airing the syndicated "Judge Judy" at 6
p.m. KCBS will continue airing two episodes of the court show,
starting at 3:30 p.m. in September instead of the current 4 p.m. time
slot.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz, the KABC-TV "Eyewitness News" veteran just hired by
KCBS, will expand the synergy between the stations as what Corsini
called the "cornerstone" of the duopoly, which won approval from
federal regulators in May. A duopoly is when one company owns or runs
two stations in the same market.</TE>
<TE>   The KCBS-KCAL duopoly is one of four locally. News Corp. owns
KTTV-TV and KCOP-TV. NBC recently purchased Spanish-language network
Telemundo, which means the network now owns KNBC, KWHY-TV and KVEA-TV
(though KWHY will have to be sold because of restrictions limiting
ownership to two stations per city.) Spanish-language rival Univision
also controls two stations: flagship KMEX-TV and KFTR-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz is not due to start at KCBS until Sept. 3. But before that
she will travel to New York to work with KCAL news anchor Pat Harvey,
reporter Joe Connable and KCBS reporter Drew Griffin on a news
special dealing with the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. The special will air on KCBS and KCAL, with an airdate to be
determined.</TE>
<TE>   When Diaz takes the KCBS anchor chair on Sept. 3, she will be
reunited with her long-standing "Eyewitness News" partner, Harold
Greene. Greene went to KCBS after 18 years at KABC. The pair will
anchor the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   Corsini said Diaz was a key to attracting a significant Latino
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Channel 2 has not done a very good job of connecting with the
Hispanic community," he said. "Laura will play a large part in us
achieving that goal."</TE>
<TE>   KCBS will also be adding an additional half-hour of news at 4:30
p.m. on Sept. 3, replacing "Judge Judy." Gretchen Carr, who currently
anchors at 6 and 11 p.m., will be one of the new anchors for that
newscast.</TE>
<TE>   Corsini is positioning the 4:30 p.m. newscast as an answer to
KNBC-TV's replacing its 4 p.m. newscast with the syndicated "Dr. Phil
McGraw" show.</TE>
<TE>   "Channel 4 announced that they're getting out of a franchise
they've had for the last 15 years to put on 'Dr. Phil,' " Corsini
said. "This is a huge opportunity for us, and we're taking full
advantage."</TE>

<HD>In 'Ado,' Jackie Mason Shticks With the Basics</HD>
<DH>It's still a Jew-versus-gentile world in the comic's
one-man show</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jackie Mason feels President Bush is basically a decent man, even if
he has trouble completing a sentence.</LD>
<LD>   So OK, Mason would say, so speaking English is not Bush's field.</LD>
<LD>   "Winston Churchill was the greatest prime minister of all time. No
one heard a word he said."</LD>
<TE>   Anyone familiar with Mason can hear his inflection in these jokes;
it's what has made him beloved to some, a Broadway fixture and an
ethnic embarrassment to others. The Mason who took the stage Tuesday
night at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, where he began a
six-performance run of the one-man show he has been doing in recent
years, "Much Ado About Everything," was less the political pundit,
which is to say there wasn't the ranting about Bill Clinton and his
various scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The fire is still in Mason's belly, but the pilot light seems a
little lower than it has been in the past. Clinton has given way to
the son of a patrician political dynasty, and as gentiles go, Bush is
evidently less objectionable. Mason's way of complimenting someone is
not to complain about him. And so, he doesn't spend much time on
Bush, beyond mild digs at his lack of presidential swagger. Funniest
is Mason's bit about the only two sentences that Bush seems to say in
response to the terrorist threat: "We're going to smoke them out, and
bring them to justice."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes he reverses it," Mason joked. " 'We'll bring them to
justice, and smoke them out.' "</TE>
<TE>   No one, it can be said, does what Jackie Mason does quite as well
as Jackie Mason. He can still fill two hours on a stage telling
ethnic jokes that to some ears are offensive or racist--a charge
that, in the context of Mason, doesn't quite suffice. He has, after
all, earned the right to be this curmudgeonly Jew, this politically
incorrect kibitzer declaiming in bursts of Yiddish, after lo these
many years onstage.</TE>
<TE>   Mason talked about e-mail and Yasser Arafat, too, but not very
memorably. Mostly, his nearly two-hour show is marked by his
bread-and-butter--the Jews-versus-gentiles worldview that has
sustained his comedy since producers told him he was "too Jewish" to
make it in show business.</TE>
<TE>   He has, of course, gone on to prove them wrong. Though not a
superstar comic, Mason found niche stardom in his 50s and 60s,
beginning with his Tony Award-winning "The World According to Me" in
1987, which was followed by more Broadway runs and tours, including
"Jackie Mason Politically Incorrect" and "Jackie Mason: Brand New."</TE>
<TE>   Whether old or new, Mason's jokes, if you're a fan, are evergreen.
Thus, gentiles can sleep on the street, but ask a Jew who wakes up in
his $9-million condo how he slept, and he'll tell you, "Not so good."</TE>
<TE>   There were complaints too from the audience Tuesday--at least from
those sitting in the upper reaches of the theater, who evidently were
having trouble hearing Mason. For that matter, seeing Mason up close
not only enables you to hear him better but also to catch his facial
expressions--the comic grimaces of complaint. And Mason, to his
credit, is still a comedian with sharp timing--gifted with voices
(Kissinger, for instance) as well as physical moves that make his Ed
Sullivan impression hilarious. As cantankerous as he can be, Mason
can also give off something much more unexpected--a certain warmth.</TE>
<TE>   "Jackie Mason--Much Ado About Everything (The Broadway Tour)"
repeats at 8 tonight, 8 p.m. Saturday, and 3 p.m. Sunday, Wilshire
Theatre, 8440 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. $37-$67. (213) 365-3500.
Running time: 90 minutes, with a 20-minute intermission.</TE>

<HD>Filmed 'Tosca' Is an Involving and Entertaining Adaptation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmed opera performances have the advantage of front-row intimacy
coupled with the loss of genuine opera-house acoustics--we get to
closely watch singing actors' faces, but we don't get the resonance
of voices and orchestra in a large theater.</LD>
<LD>   Benoit Jacquot's film of Puccini's "Tosca" goes beyond previous
opera films, which for the most part merely documented existing
staged performances, though promising wider vistas--outdoor settings,
for instance. Jacquot deals in real-world pictures of Roman venues
and actual, bucolic scenery, too. But he adds other dimensions:
black-and-white scenes from the sound-recording sessions alternating
with the color-film action, the conductor, orchestra and principals
in street clothes, addressing the microphones; the principals' words
spoken over some of the singing, indicating the characters' thoughts.</LD>
<LD>   Altogether, this is successful as a film, while at the same time
being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, masterpiece. What feisty musicologist Joseph Kerman called a
"shabby little shocker" 50 years ago is indeed in the same class with
"La Boheme" and "Turandot," a class into which it has not
automatically been put by its many critics. Furthermore, the present
performance, sung passionately by Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna
and Ruggero Raimondi, and conducted by Antonio Pappano, underlines
that stature.</TE>
<TE>   Bring out the handkerchiefs. The duets in Acts 1 and 3--the film
wastes no time on intermissions and comes in at a trim 119
minutes--caress and refresh this beautiful music with an Italianate
affection that makes it sound new. In the opening scene, the ardent
vulnerability of the lovers is breathtaking--Gheorghiu and Alagna
flirt and smooch with utter credibility, and their singing is an
aural feast.</TE>
<TE>   They achieve a similar plateau in Act 3, where "O dolci mani"
crowns the musical climax and sets up the final tragedy. And they
look as young and beautiful as they sound.</TE>
<TE>   In tandem with Gheorghiu's wary Tosca, Raimondi's G. Gordon Liddy
of a Scarpia provides the chills and cold blood in a harrowing second
act of vivid colors and polished marble. Other directors'
cliches--the premeditated stabbing, the dressing of the corpse--are
eschewed; Tosca kills Scarpia quickly and passionately and leaves
without second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Jacquot adds some contemporary touches to the scenario, for
instance the black-and-white shots of the recording sessions and
those Roman locations fleshing out some scenes--if you've never
visited the Castel Sant'Angelo, you have now. None of this distracts,
though the sound engineering is inconsistent. Besides the principals,
the surrounding players are able and convincing. They include Enrico
Fissore as a faceted Sacristan, Maurizio Muraro as the harassed
Angelotti and David Cangelosi as Spoletta.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Antonio Pappano elicits colorful performances from the
Orchestra &amp; Chorus of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden as well
from the cast.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: some nongraphic violence in Act 2.</TE>

<HD>A Sportscasting Veteran Who Knows the Score--on TV or Radio</HD>
<DH>Todd Donoho co-hosts a show on KSPN with Dave Stone, and is
resuming his morning reports on KLOS' 'Mark &amp; Brian.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not since college has sportscaster Todd Donoho worked exclusively in
radio, but his bosses at ESPN don't consider him inexperienced. They
want him to do the same things he's done for 25 years on
television--just without the cameras rolling.</LD>
<LD>   So "The Todd Donoho Show With Dave Stone," which airs weekdays
from 1 to 4 p.m. on KSPN-AM (1110), the area's ESPN Radio affiliate,
became the station's second local program.</LD>
<LD>   "Todd is somebody who I personally have been a fan of for a long
time," said Erik Braverman, program director at KSPN and KABC-AM
(790), whether it was Donoho's time as host of a sports trivia show
on cable TV's now-defunct Financial News Network or his decade at
KABC-TV as a sportscaster and host of "Monday Night Live," a weekly
program that ran during the football season and featured trivia,
sports news and guests ranging from Mickey Mantle to Milton Berle.</LD>
<TE>   "If you ever saw his TV show on FNN or even 'Monday Night Live,'
they were radio shows that happened to be on TV," Braverman said.
"Talk radio is really about the personality, and does the person have
the knowledge and the warmth and the ability to connect with the
listeners? Todd, as much as anyone, can deliver on those."</TE>
<TE>   He added that Stone, Donoho's co-host and a former announcer for
the Harlem Globetrotters, is serving as a combination co-pilot and
color commentator.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a regular encyclopedia of Los Angeles sports knowledge,"
Braverman said. "He knows the history of every single L.A. sports
team, and he's very, very passionate about whatever the subject is.
It allows Todd to play off of him."</TE>
<TE>   Donoho, who lives in Valencia with his wife and three teenage
sons, said he loves the free-form nature of talk radio, in which a
show subject might be planned, but an unexpected call or occurrence
can send the program veering off into another, even more interesting
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "In television, if you're doing a three-minute segment, it's
planned down to the second. In radio it's basically the host, the
callers and the topics," he said. "There's a lot more spontaneity
with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to think, in a sense, the radio show is kind of like
'Monday Night Live' on radio, a sports variety show," said Donoho,
46. "A nice, fun, entertaining and analytical mix of sports, with
personalities, interviews, trivia questions."</TE>
<TE>   "The Todd Donoho Show With Dave Stone" joins the station's other
locally focused program, "The McDonnell-Douglas Show," with longtime
sports-talk host Joe McDonnell and Long Beach Press-Telegram sports
columnist Doug Krikorian.</TE>
<TE>   Donoho's show began in the spring as a temporary program during
the Lakers' playoff drive, when station management decided it wanted
a local show to feed off the big local sports story. Braverman said
the program clicked and gained a permanent spot on the schedule a
week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to hear the program develop over time. We thought, 'We've
been looking for a second local show, and this is it,' " Braverman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The ebullient, clean-cut host is also returning to KLOS-FM (95.5),
where Donoho does weekday morning sports reports on the "Mark &amp; Brian
Show," as he has for the past 14 years--except for a year layoff
while he was at Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   There he served as an anchor on the "Southern California Sports
Report," but in spite of a local Emmy Award nomination in 2002, the
network didn't renew his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Most Southern Californians know Donoho from his long stint at
KABC-TV. But before that, he gained nationwide recognition and a cult
of fans as host of the low-budget but highly entertaining "Timeout
for Trivia" on the fledgling FNN/Score cable network, from 1985 to
1989. On a spartan set, accompanied by crowd noises and other sound
effects, Donoho read sports trivia and sparred with the callers
trying to answer the questions.</TE>
<TE>   The show is also where he developed his trademark catchphrases,
replying "Tremendous, my friend," to someone asking how he was, and
delivering dozens of different variations on "Take a hike!" to anyone
giving a lamebrained answer to a trivia question.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have people coming up to me and saying, 'Timeout for
Trivia--I loved that show.' This is 13 years later," said Donoho, who
added that he doesn't tire of fans peppering him with his own lines.
"I look at it as their being kind. When somebody tells me to 'take a
hike,' I give them a wink and a smile. It tells me they're watching."</TE>
<TE>   And it was that show that brought him to Southern California, when
the cable outlet he was working for in Cincinnati was going out of
business, and the workers' contracts were sold to the L.A.-based FNN.</TE>
<TE>   "They said you can have two months' severance pay, or you can
continue in L.A.," said Donoho, whose wife was pregnant at the time
with their second child. "So I said, 'California, here I come.' "</TE>
<TE>   While it was tinkering with its schedule last week, adding the
Donoho program and trimming "McDonnell-Douglas" from four hours to
three to make room, KSPN dropped "The Tony Kornheiser Show," hosted
by the Washington Post sports columnist. By doing that it extended
the air time for "The Mike &amp; Mike in the Morning Show," with former
NFL defensive tackle Mike Golic and ESPN "SportsCenter" anchor Mike
Greenberg.</TE>
<TE>   "Our listeners don't get a chance to hear how good this show is,"
Braverman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike &amp; Mike" had been running from 3 to 7 a.m., but now it will
occupy a seven-hour block, with KSPN repeating the show's first three
hours from 7 to 10 a.m.--Kornheiser's former time slot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he does a good show. It really was the odd show out,"
Braverman said of Kornheiser's program. He added that the format of
"Mike &amp; Mike" also has more room for local segments, and he stressed
that the decision to preempt Kornheiser came before his recent
conflict with ESPN Radio management.</TE>
<TE>   Kornheiser had been suspended for a week without pay by his ESPN
bosses for criticizing them on the air about personnel moves.
Management fired his senior producer and associate producer, along
with two other employees, for reportedly e-mailing inappropriate
material from adult Web sites to co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   When ESPN Radio General Manager Eric Schoenfeld asked Kornheiser
to stop talking about the matter on the air, Kornheiser continued
making comments during commercial breaks--audio still available to
fans listening on the Internet. Management then suspended Kornheiser,
who has a five-year contract with ESPN paying him a reported $500,000
annually, and whose show is heard on about 240 stations nationwide.</TE>

<HD>Angst Takes a Starring Role, and It Hurts</HD>
<DH>In 'Group,' eight actresses portray participants in therapy
and the familiar problems prove grueling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inspired by their experiences in group therapy, filmmakers Marilyn
Freeman and Anne de Marcken gathered eight actresses and worked with
them in developing characters so fully that, once their six cameras
started rolling, they would feel confident in improvising roles as
participants in a 21-week program conducted by an actual therapist
(Ruby Martin).</LD>
<LD>   Except for the fact that all eight are overly articulate, their
feature film "Group," which employs a split-screen technique, has an
authentic documentary feel to it.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of the supposed 21-week course, we're left feeling that
the women are better for having attempted to face their various
demons, that they learned to rise above self-involvement and that,
thankfully, they don't act as if they had undergone some miracle
cure.</LD>
<TE>   All this is just fine, but the well-intended "Group" is
nevertheless problematic. It's relentlessly grueling, as therapy can
be, and not everyone will be able to see a reason to watch it.</TE>
<TE>   The actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they
portray so convincingly, but viewers don't get enough of that
background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather
than types. They evolve persuasively, but it's difficult to shake the
awareness that we're watching actresses portraying women ridden with
angst over depressingly familiar family and spousal problems, health
issues, loneliness and just plain unhappiness.</TE>
<TE>   "Group" does succeed in evoking the often-painful process people
experience in learning to listen to one another and respect
differences. One woman announces she's uncomfortable with gay people;
in the window of the gathering place, we see a sign proclaiming that
the therapy course will be "queer friendly."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to connect the unfamiliar actresses with the women
they play, but the standout is Pipi, a plump, blue-haired, tattooed
punker type played with no-holds-barred gusto by Nomy Lamm, a writer,
activist, musician and drag performer.</TE>
<TE>   Lamm is a powerhouse presence with much emotional depth. How much
more rewarding it would be to watch a real documentary on Lamm
instead of a fictional film that's all the more a downer because we
know all the pain and misery it serves up isn't the real thing.</TE>

<HD>Standing Ritual</HD>
<DH>Most L.A. theater productions get a standing ovation. Are
we less discerning, more easygoing or just polite?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The reviews are in:</LD>
<LD>   "They remembered their lines!"</LD>
<LD>   "The whole cast showed up!"</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody fell into the orchestra pit!"</TE>
<TE>   "People sang stuff and danced!"</TE>
<TE>   In reality, no publication printed these reviews; you'd never find
a legitimate theater critic waxing rhapsodic over the basic
requirements of putting on a show. The production that they didn't
write about does not exist either.</TE>
<TE>   But, after years of observing the behavior of theatergoers in
Greater Los Angeles, one reaches the conclusion that neither the
nonexistence of this show--nor its astonishing mediocrity--would stop
an L.A. audience from giving it a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   It may be more difficult to please the critics--but to make the
Los Angeles theater crowd happy, it seems that all you have to do is
finish the show. Can't act, can't sing, can't dance--but, hey,
nobody's perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Posing the question "Are there too many standing ovations in Los
Angeles?" touches a nerve with some members of the local theater
community, who insist this is a misconception fueled by jaded
journalists who attend way too many opening nights, where the house
is papered with friends, agents, celebrities and the performers' moms
and dads.</TE>
<TE>   "I am totally in favor of standing ovations," says Rick Barr,
general manager of Pasadena Civic Auditorium. "I think the press and
others are looking to be cynical about it, to say that audiences
don't know what they're doing, that it's too frequent, that it
doesn't mean anything. It means something, it's the audience's way of
responding."</TE>
<TE>   But fact or fiction, there exists a widely held perception that
audiences here in the show-biz capital will give a standing ovation
to anything that moves.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon Epps, artistic director of the Pasadena Playhouse, wonders
if too much standing is confusing for audiences and performers. "If
it now occurs for anything and everything that you see, what defines
that theater experience as being great instead of moderately
successful?" he muses.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe not. "I do feel that, if you go to the theater
often, you can feel the difference between one that is genuine, and
one that is pro forma, or perfunctory. There is a spontaneity and
energy about a real standing ovation instead of one that is about
etiquette."</TE>
<TE>   Well, there's something new for L.A. actors to worry about: To
paraphrase a line from a neurotic character in a classic Woody Allen
film, you've finally had a standing ovation, but it was the wrong
kind.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the standing ovation--of whatever kind--has become
like the 15% tip: no longer a recognition for exceptional service,
but an obligatory payment to any waiter who doesn't drop the
catch-of-the-day on your head (those servers get 20%, so they won't
feel bad).</TE>
<TE>   Does our penchant for standing ovations reflect a national trend
toward over-congratulation, the theatrical equivalent of grade
inflation? Are we seeing in the theater the same trend that has led
horrified educational psychologists to speculate we've created a
generation of egocentric monster children with too much self-esteem?</TE>
<TE>   Or are we simply experiencing something that's only natural in a
town full of actors, directors, writers and stage or film crews?
After all, where else in America do you find movie audiences wildly
applauding the technical credits, cheering for the gaffer, the key
grip or the unit publicist as lustily as for Dustin or Denzel? (For
those of you who applaud after movies, there's something you should
take steps to deal with: The people for whom you are clapping are not
really there. Same goes for any standing ovations you may be awarding
to your TV screen.)</TE>
<TE>   Possible, too, that standing ovations happen more here because
whether you're in the entertainment industry on not, you're in the
industry. This is Hollywood, baby, whether you live in Beverly Hills
or just east of the Cerritos Auto Square. Even if you aren't looking
to be discovered, you could be. Everything here is a performance, an
audition, and that includes applauding for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   A few years back, in a Melrose hair salon, I overheard a woman
instructing her hairdresser that she needed her shortish red-gold
locks cut in such a way that her coif would look best just after she
ran both hands through her hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I have this gesture that I do a lot," she explained very
seriously, demonstrating the move. Suddenly, it was the end of an
exciting, exhaustingly creative business meeting; her fingers swept
through the red-gold thatch in the sort of frustrated but exhilarated
brain-massage only a woman with such an exciting, exhaustingly
creative life would require.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe our standing ovations are like that gesture--pure theater.
By the end of the performance, her hair is standing, and so are we.</TE>
<TE>   In another twist on the standing ovation as performance art
theory, Gil Cates, producing director at Westwood's Geffen Playhouse,
believes people on the West Coast are just more demonstrative than
they are on the East Coast. "I do think that people in L.A., while
they are generally more jaded and have been exposed to more special
events, are nonetheless still looser than the people in the East,"
Cates says.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Kennedy, director of administration for Los Angeles
Opera, agrees. "It is a fairly discerning audience, but when they see
something they really like, it's something they make known," Kennedy
says. "They are not worried about whether it's naive to appear
enthusiastic. It may have something to do with tradition--the
tradition of going to the performing arts is younger here, so we are
not quite as hidebound as to the way we are supposed to behave."</TE>
<TE>   She adds, however, that while Los Angeles audiences are more
likely to share their feelings than, say, Philadelphia's, it's
nothing compared with the hooting and hollering that goes on in the
opera houses of Italy. "They have standing ovations that are half an
hour long," she says. "We don't have quite as many people booing and
hissing, either; the audience is a little more restrained. There are
cultural differences."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond California's predilection for openness, Cates, like many
others, believes the obligatory opening-night ovation is as likely to
happen in the Big Apple as the Big Orange, because the show's
investors are sitting front row center. "I've never seen anything
halfway decent where the audience didn't stand," Cates says. "People
who put up their money are going to stand unless it's a real turkey."</TE>
<TE>   Cates' turkey theory was proven only hours after this conversation
took place. "Oscar and Felix, A New Look at the Odd Couple," opened
at the Geffen the same night. Times reviewer Sean Mitchell, who gave
"Oscar and Felix" a lukewarm review, reports that less than half of
the audience responded with the standard opening-night ovation.</TE>
<TE>   This, even with what is usually an L.A. standing ovation
guarantee: The stars of the show, John Larroquette and Joe Regalbuto,
both had sitcoms that were on long enough to be sold into syndication
("Night Court" and "Murphy Brown," respectively).</TE>
<TE>   The following night fewer than 15 people stood. That is, of those
who remained in the theater until the end--apparently many who came
to the show expecting escapist entertainment instead found an
entertainment best escaped at intermission.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's New York, L.A. or somewhere in between, Martin
Wiviott, managing director of Broadway/L.A., calls it unfair to hold
an audience's standing ovation to some sort of pious ethical
standard. "Whatever the reason is, whether the person is there to
support a friend or because they love the music of the show, you are
happy to have them there," he says. "What they do isn't phony to
them. It's their reaction; it's not wrong just because it isn't my
reaction."</TE>
<TE>   According to its artistic director, Ed Waterstreet, if you really
want to gauge honest audience reaction to a show, come to Deaf West
Theatre in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind those star-studded opening nights; just listen to the
deaf. "Deaf people are a tougher sell," he says. "A lot of them
haven't gone to theater a lot, so they are learning to be an audience
when they come to our shows. Sometimes hearing people will give a
standing ovation just because it's a new thing. But the deaf people,
they have to be convinced."</TE>
<TE>   Deaf audience members often choose to wave their arms in the air
instead of applauding, so deaf actors can see their appreciation.
Waterstreet notes that the hearing audience often copies the
behavior. Personally, Waterstreet prefers to see a combination of
both. "I like applauding up in the air," he says. "Because then you
have the sound for the hearing people, and the visual cue."</TE>
<TE>   Jimmie McDermott, senior stage manager for the Mark Taper Forum
and the Ahmanson Theatre, also endorses some audience respect for the
magic of theater. Not necessarily a standing ovation--just something
a little more courteous than rising in order to be the first one out
the door.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll find it happening at the Taper all the time--the minute
the curtain call starts, people are starting to leave, which I find
extremely rude," he says. "These actors have worked all night to
either entertain you or not entertain you. The fact is, they have
worked, even if it's a bad show."</TE>

<HD>Spending Some Time With the Real Anna Nicole Smith</HD>
<DH>Television* Maybe the ads for her new E! show make fun of
her, but the former stripper-model doesn't mind. She'll still let the
cameras follow her. *</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH HARRIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When last seen by America, Anna Nicole Smith was locked in a
seven-year legal battle over her late husband's Texas oil fortune.</LD>
<LD>   The former Playboy Playmate, who has yet to collect a dime, has
decided it's time to get back to work.</LD>
<LD>   So instead of seeing Smith in courtroom footage on the evening
news, viewers can peep at her bizarre world when E! Entertainment
Television debuts "The Anna Nicole Show" on Sunday at 10 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   The 13 episodes are an attempt by E! to cash in on the
celebrity-reality craze initiated with great success by MTV's "The
Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   "We've been trying to figure out what we can do with Anna because
we know there's this fascination that people have with her," said
Mark Sonnenberg, E! executive vice president of entertainment. "When
'The Osbournes' came out, it was a no-brainer to us. Let's put the
cameras on her and let's do a show."</TE>
<TE>   Since May, cameras have been trailing the 34-year-old former
stripper and Guess? model from the time she wakes up to the time she
goes to bed. Among the scenes captured are Smith telling her black
toy poodle to stop passing gas, and the buxom blond looking into her
shirt and saying, "Hello, down there."</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had sex in two years," Smith grumbles on camera.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she has a twinge of regret.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of those things you say that you wish you didn't,"
Smith says later in an interview. She says she isn't dating anyone at
the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Another embarrassing moment occurred when Smith forgot to turn off
the microphones in the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it was kind of crazy, but now I've learned to live with
my crew," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising spots for the show say, "It's not supposed to be funny
... it just is."</TE>
<TE>   Smith says she realizes E! is probably making fun of her, but she
plays the good sport. "My life is funny," she said. "Things happen to
me all the time, and it just is funny."</TE>
<TE>   The channel first encountered Smith when it chose to make a 1997
"E! True Hollywood Story" about her. She didn't participate in the
episode, which was later expanded to two hours and is still shown.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very honest, she did not like the 'True Hollywood Story,'
" Sonnenberg said, noting that the episode still doubles or triples
its viewer total with each airing. When the channel asked to talk
with her about a series, "we didn't know if she was going to come in
and tell us off."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, an eager Smith said yes, relieved at the prospect of
doing something other than sitting in courtrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just the perfect time for me to get out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy court ruled in December 2000 that Smith was entitled
to $475 million of her late husband's fortune. A federal judge
reduced that to $88 million this past March, but the son of J. Howard
Marshall plans to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall was 90 when he died in 1995, 14 months after marrying
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't plan to discuss him on the show. "I'd like to keep
that private," she said with a straight face.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers can tag along as Smith goes bowling, hits the batting
cage, checks out Hollywood parties, visits the dentist and takes
driving lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a driver, so I've never gotten a license," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Like any celebrity worth her salt, Smith is surrounded by an
entourage. Howard K. Stern (not the radio host) is her attorney; Kim
Walther is her purple-haired assistant; and Daniel is her 16-year-old
son from her first marriage, to Billy Smith, whom she worked with at
Jim's Krispy Fried Chicken in Mexia, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my mom, but I hate the cameras," announces Daniel, who,
along with Stern, is the most normal-looking of the bunch.</TE>
<TE>   And Smith hardly goes anywhere without Sugar Pie, the
Prozac-popping poodle with her own therapist.</TE>
<TE>   "If I go out somewhere, she won't eat and she won't drink and she
just shakes until I get back," Smith said. "She's just crazy about
her mom."</TE>
<TE>   Walther is more than a dedicated employee; she sports a tattoo of
Smith on her left arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to have something that down the road I would still be
happy with, and she's a great person," said Walther, whose duties
include grocery shopping, paying bills and picking up Daniel from
school.</TE>
<TE>   While Smith awaits the outcome of her legal battles, she plans to
get back into modeling and write her memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who admires, and resembles, Marilyn Monroe and Christie
Brinkley hopes the show gives her some credibility and boosts her
acting career. She has had small roles in several TV shows and
movies.</TE>
<TE>   "People will see that maybe I have a little talent and will start
to take me seriously as an actress," she said.</TE>

<HD>Good Timing Aids Perceptive Rock Tale</HD>
<DH>Filmmaker Sam Jones spent a year with Wilco as the band
went through some defining moments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's sometimes more important for a documentary filmmaker to be lucky
than good. Director Sam Jones turns out to be both, which is why "I
Am Trying to Break Your Heart" turned into an exciting and involving
rock music doc, a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous
world.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, a well-known still photographer and commercial director
making his feature debut, was shrewd enough to pick the Chicago
alternative band Wilco as the subject of his first film.</LD>
<LD>   But even he could not have known that the pivotal year he spent
following the group would be the most dramatic of its existence,
involving painful personnel changes and a widely publicized split
with its record company, situations that emerge as the film's
dramatic centerpieces.</LD>
<TE>   The main draw here, as it should be, is Wilco's music, an
adventurous, sophisticated, extremely welcoming sound that has won it
an intensely loyal following. Even if you've never heard of the
group, "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart" (named after one of its
songs) could well turn you into a fan.</TE>
<TE>   The group's star and writer of its thoughtful lyrics is Jeff
Tweedy, the intensely charismatic lead singer with a captivating
voice and the kind of sensitive/poetic good looks that haven't hurt
his fan base. Although Wilco has five musicians when the film opens,
Tweedy is always first among equals, the one band member it's easiest
to pick out of a crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I Am Trying" picks up Wilco in its Chicago loft studio as the
band begins to work on what everyone considers to be a pivotal album,
the one manager Tony Margherita calls "the record that needs to take
the band to another level," both artistically and commercially.</TE>
<TE>   Although the words "creative process" are considerably overused,
one of the virtues of "I Am Trying" is that it puts the band's method
onto film, showing the musicians, in Tweedy's words, destroying their
songs to re-create them in a more arresting manner. We see both how
seriously the musicians take their music and the reasons they have
for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "I Am Trying" also captures a classic example of something even
more resistant to being filmed, and that is creative differences. To
see band member Jay Bennett insistently repeating, "I just want you
to understand me" as he and Tweedy wrangle over a not particularly
significant musical moment is to understand how much these
relationships have in common with marriages, as well as to sense that
this association is not headed in a positive direction.</TE>
<TE>   The band handed in the finished "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" album,
easily its most ambitious, on the very day that Howie Klein,
president of Reprise Records, was leaving the company. It was not a
good omen, as Reprise's new management proved to be less receptive to
Wilco's sound, with all kinds of unforeseen results.</TE>
<TE>   One of the things that makes "I Am Trying" involving is that what
happened to Wilco is apparently symptomatic of a kind of dumbing down
of the record business that sounds not unlike what goes on with
films.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" from a commercial point of
view, explains Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke, is that "it
doesn't tell you exactly who it's for, how it will sell, what it's
about." In other words, the very things that make it original make it
suspect in today's business world. It's a paradigmatic tale, and "I
Am Trying to Break Your Heart" shows us just how it went down.</TE>

<HD>Gerry Mulligan Tribute Is a Two-Sided Hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gerry Mulligan's arrival in Los Angeles in the early '50s--reportedly
after hitchhiking out from New York--had a singular effect on West
Coast jazz. His so-called piano-less quartet with trumpeter Chet
Baker set the tone for the cool, contrapuntal style that would become
associated with the music of the decade. Less visibly, his
application of that style to his writing for larger ensembles would
also have a significant impact on the arriving young
arranger-composers of the period.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the Hermosa Playhouse, the Los Angeles Jazz
Institute celebrated the 50th anniversary of Mulligan's Southland
arrival with a program exploring his work for his Tentette and for
the Stan Kenton Orchestra. The selections were performed by an
all-star ensemble of Los Angeles players, some of whom were veterans
of one or another Mulligan ensemble.</LD>
<LD>   The programming, which presented the Tentette pieces first,
followed in the concert's second half by the Kenton big band charts,
offered a fascinating opportunity to experience the skill with which
Mulligan transformed the bare skeleton of the quartet style--first
into spare, 10-piece versions, then into fully fleshed orchestral
works.</LD>
<TE>   A pair of pieces, for example--"Walking Shoes" and "Simba"--was
displayed, first as works for the 10-piece band, followed by big band
versions ("Simba" was retitled "Intro" in the Kenton rendering). In
both cases, Mulligan augmented his musical palette without losing
either the harmonic airiness or the bright sense of swing of the
smaller interpretations.</TE>
<TE>   What he added, instead, was the potential of the large group, with
its powerhouse brass section, to generate dramatic bursts of sound
and fury.</TE>
<TE>   When all those elements came together in works composed
specifically for the Kenton Orchestra--the classic "Youngblood" was
the best example--the results were magnificent, a stunning example of
Mulligan's unerring ability to retain his primal rhythmic drive and
love for melody in everything he did.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Holman, who conducted the celebration's ensembles and who is
a major composer-arranger in his own right, was precisely right when
he introduced "Youngblood" as a "masterpiece."</TE>
<TE>   Repertory concerts of this sort are vitally important, and
producer Ken Poston and the Los Angeles Jazz Institute deserve praise
for their continuing efforts to keep this music alive. One can only
wish, however, that funding was available to provide more thorough
rehearsal time--this was, after all, a demanding program of
music--and more effective promotion.</TE>
<TE>   That said, there were strong solo efforts from, to mention only a
few, baritone saxophonist Bob Efford, taking on the weighty task of
reviving the Mulligan instrumental sound; trumpeters Bob Summers and
Ron Stout; trombonist Andy Martin and Bob Enevoldsen; and
saxophonists Lanny Morgan, Doug Webb and Bill Perkins.</TE>
<TE>   The two ensembles engaged the spirit, if occasionally blurring the
precise notes, of the Mulligan musical magic.</TE>

<LD>Benny Carter recorded for such a lengthy period in so many different
settings that one could make a dozen, entirely different lists of his
finest work.</LD>
<LD>   That said, here's a grouping that offers a brief introduction to
the remarkable range of his talents.</LD>
<LD>   * Six CDs on the Melodie Jazz Classic label (available from
Amazon.com) provide a comprehensive overview of Carter's early
career. The individual discs are titled "1929-1933," "1933-1936,"
"1936," "1937-1939," "1939-1940" and "1940-1941," and cover
everything from his work with the Chocolate Dandies to his own big
band.</LD>
<TE>   * "Cosmopolite: The Oscar Peterson Sessions" (Verve, 1952-54).
Carter swings with Peterson's marvelous early quartets, which
featured bassist Ray Brown and Barney Kessel or Herb Ellis on guitar.</TE>
<TE>   * "Benny Carter New Jazz Sounds: The Urbane Sessions" (Verve,
1952). A double CD from the '50s, featuring Carter performing with
strings and in sessions with Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie.</TE>
<TE>   * "Further Definitions" (GRP/Impulse!, 1961). A CD that includes
the original LP release as well as a follow-up album, "Additions to
Further Definitions" from 1966. Carter's arrangements for saxophone
quartet--revisiting a similar session he did in 1937--are played by,
among others, Coleman Hawkins, Phil Woods, Charlie Rouse and Carter.</TE>
<TE>   * "Benny Carter Songbook" (volumes 1 and 2, Music Masters, 1995).
Carter's songs sung by, among others, Joe Williams, Diana Krall, Jon
Hendricks, Peggy Lee, Shirley Horn and Carter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was out of town during last week's funeral service for Samantha
Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   But thanks to television, I watched from afar those wreath-adorned
tributes at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, and noted that
cable's news channels had again reduced tragedy primarily to
Hollywood-style entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   It's what you might expect, especially from movie-minded CNN,
which this week assigned its sober graybeard, Wolf Blitzer, to
shamelessly promote "Austin Powers in Goldmember," a movie from New
Line Cinema, which is a unit of the news channel's parent company,
AOL Time Warner. Or did anchor-reporter Blitzer's cozy interviews
with cast members, on separate nights, come under the category of
news instead of smarmy cross-promotion?</LD>
<TE>   At least the Samantha telecasts mingled glitz with heartfelt
dignity.</TE>
<TE>   I heard the chiming bells, the musical performances and the eulogy
from her mother, saw the brown casket covered by pink roses and
caught the slide show of Samantha's artwork accompanied by music from
"Peter Pan."</TE>
<TE>   Those watching with me in Kansas City, Mo., were transfixed and,
of course, as moved as everyone else by this nationally televised
memorial for Samantha, observed by an estimated 3,000 inside the
Crystal Cathedral, with another 2,000 reportedly listening outside
via loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a five-star farewell for a 5-year-old from Stanton whose
widely reported abduction, sexual assault and slaying outraged the
multitudes, and whose memory touched deeply the many Americans who
had met her posthumously through blanket media coverage.</TE>
<TE>   A level of coverage denied most other young victims.</TE>
<TE>   All of this got me thinking again about the camera as a time
machine that transports us across galaxies of human experience. And
about the Rolodex of visual history that defines us at specific
moments in time. No, not Wolf dutifully chatting up "Goldmember"
little person Verne Troyer.</TE>
<TE>   More famous pictures come to mind:</TE>
<TE>   The somber face of the Great Depression in Dorothea Lange's
migrant mother in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Rosenthal's triumphant Iwo Jima flag-raising shot in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   The same year's V-J Day euphoria in Alfred Eisenstaedt's photo of
a sailor's back-bending smooch of a nurse he'd grabbed in Times
Square.</TE>
<TE>   The ugly mask of bigotry in Bill Reed's tobacco-chewing Neshoba
County Sheriff and his deputy, grinning defiantly in court with their
redneck cronies when arraigned in 1964 for the Mississippi murders of
three civil rights workers.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Jackson's historic picture of Jack Ruby gunning down Lee
Harvey Oswald in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's screaming Vietnam agony caught in John Filo's 1970
photo of Mary Ann Vecchio kneeling beside a slain Kent State student.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD raging out of control in George Holliday's amateur
footage of white cops brutally clobbering African American Rodney
King in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Wall-to-wall TV of O.J. Simpson's white Ford Bronco staying just
ahead of pursuing squad cars in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Which of this generation's signature freeze frames will
memorialize the tiny blip of time we occupy early in the 21st
century? Surely the most powerful will be an airliner slamming into
one of New York's Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Will Samantha Runnion's memorial service be another, the
children's choirs, video biography and big-screen pictures of her
beautiful, smiling face becoming metaphors for missing Elizabeth
Smart and slain Polly Klass, JonBenet Ramsey and Danielle van Dam?</TE>
<TE>   Note the omission of Cassandra Williamson, age 6. Few will recall
her memorial service at the Twin Oaks Presbyterian Church in Valley
Park, Mo., even though it was public.</TE>
<TE>   Cassandra was snatched from her father's home and killed, her own
funeral coming not long after Samantha's. The Associated Press
reported that Cassandra's white casket was open to show her clutching
a stuffed animal and family picture, and that her mother leaned over
and kissed her daughter's cheek.</TE>
<TE>   No national TV for that, however. It was aired live only in St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   You could make a strong case, with no rebuttal from me, that such
intimate moments should never be beamed to the nation, even when the
public and media are invited in. You may argue that TV is already too
much the Big Brotherly eternal witness of all things, that ... enough
already with the voyeuristic hidden cameras and "caught on tape"
mania now extended to "reality show" charades whose participants
pretend to be unaware of the cameras driving their behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the question, however: Why do media--especially TV
cameras--make arbitrary choices that appear to value one life over
another? Children go missing and are murdered all the time. And each
of these cases is newsworthy. Yet why is coverage lavished on one and
not another?</TE>
<TE>   I have insisted repeatedly that TV dwelt obsessively on the
unsolved slaying of JonBenet Ramsey because she was white, her
parents were rich and there was footage of her as a rouged-up cowgirl
that would be replayed endlessly. White and wealthy also apply to
Elizabeth Smart.</TE>
<TE>   Why Samantha and not Cassandra, however? Two tragic victims about
the same age, and both white.</TE>
<TE>   "Samantha Runnion was a national story right away because the news
networks started covering it, and they set the agenda," said one
reporter I know. "Her case had a full 24-hour life, in a sense,
because we didn't know she was dead until the next morning. The other
case [Cassandra's] was over almost as soon as it began. Perhaps if
she hadn't been found for two or three days, it would have been
different."</TE>
<TE>   A "big market/smaller market thing" also came into play, this
reporter theorized. Samantha was slain in the L.A. area, Cassandra in
St. Louis, and there's more national interest in stories here than in
smaller cities. "Also, there are more news resources here than in St.
Louis," he added.</TE>
<TE>   And another thing, he said. When it came to news coverage,
Cassandra's death competed with the ongoing plight of the trapped
Pennsylvania miners. In other words, a story's coverage is determined
by what else is breaking at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the reporter believes that national coverage of
Samantha's killing probably went too far. "Was it a sad story? Yes.
Was it a story that tugged at your heart? Yes. But is that what
should determine news value?"</TE>
<TE>   As I'm writing this, by the way, L.A. stations and CNN, the Fox
News Channel and MSNBC are live with news of the abduction of two
teenage girls in Lancaster who were taken at gunpoint from their
dates about 1 a.m. Thursday by a man described as Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The girls were later found safe in Kern County. But speculation
zoomed even before police held their first morning news conference.
Someone on Fox faulted their investigation, and another sage believed
the suspect was a fugitive who wanted the girls as a "bargaining
chip." A retired police detective weighed in too.</TE>
<TE>   "Tijuana is a good place to check," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And they could be there by now," a Fox anchor said. On MSNBC, a
former FBI profiler also felt the suspect was "on the run."</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps careening wildly, like much of TV.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's column appears Mondays and Fridays. He can be

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Benny Carter will be 95 on Thursday. A veteran of virtually every
part of the great 20th century expansion of jazz, an important
influence upon the music as an instrumentalist, a composer and an
arranger, he is now one of the patriarchs of the art, a direct
conduit into its checkered history.</LD>
<LD>   Carter has lived for the last 25 years with his wife, Hilma, in a
sunny, airy home situated near the top of the Hollywood Hills. His
windowed study is filled with memorabilia--photos of Carter
throughout his seven-decade career, awards of every size and manner,
shelves overflowing with books, LPs and CDs. Interestingly and, since
Carter no longer plays either of his primary instruments--saxophone
or trumpet--somewhat poignantly, there is the presence, almost
unnoticeable under a table, of a musical instrument stand, intended
to hold both or either of his two horns, but with no instrument in
sight.</LD>
<LD>   A bit bent over, using a cane for stability, Carter still
possesses a wry wit and an extraordinary memory for names, places and
faces. He also proudly describes the reaction of a Department of
Motor Vehicles examiner recently when his license came up for
renewal.</LD>
<TE>   "I took the eye test and passed it on the spot," he says. "Then,
when he asked me to sign something, I pulled out my reading glasses.
He looked at me and said, 'Wait, you wear glasses?' And I said,
'Sure, but just for reading.' "</TE>
<TE>   Carter's last public appearance as a player took place at Catalina
Bar &amp; Grill in March 1998. Seated in the audience on opening night to
review his performance, I was amazed at the quality of his playing.
There was, first of all, his sheer ability to execute the mechanical
aspects of playing the alto saxophone, which require a complex
combination of lip, teeth and mouth control, synchronized with
precise finger movements, driven by a constant flow of breath. Add to
that a roving melodic imagination, underscored by a sophisticated
harmonic ear. Ninety years young at the time, Carter still delivered
the same coolly expressive tone and subtle sense of swing that have
always been distinctive elements in his playing.</TE>
<TE>   Doubling on saxophone and trumpet is not a common phenomenon,
largely because the embouchure technique--the manner in which the
mouth is positioned to drive air into the instrument--is so different
for each. And Carter is one of the very rare artists who has managed
to perform credibly and creatively on both.</TE>
<TE>   He humorously blames the late trumpeter Doc Cheatham--a lifetime
friend and musical associate--for having urged him to stretch out on
the instrument in the early '30s.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept telling me to just step out front and do it," he recalls.
"And, you know, it was my first love. So finally I did. He even gave
me a mouthpiece, and it turned out to be the only trumpet mouthpiece
I ever used."</TE>
<TE>   Carter is equally generous with praise in other areas, as when he
describes his role in helping to bring sophisticated jazz sounds to
Europe in the '30s.</TE>
<TE>   "Leonard Feather [former Los Angeles Times jazz critic] had a lot
to do with that," says Carter. "He was the one who arranged for me to
come to London to work for the BBC, and we remained friends until
Leonard passed away in 1994."</TE>
<TE>   Characteristically, Carter also tends to minimize the quality of
his own efforts by referring to the accomplishments of others, even
though he has to stretch to come up with credible comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of doubling on more than one instrument, he asks, "Have
you heard James Morrison?" mentioning the remarkable Australian
musician who moves freely from saxophone to trumpet to trombone. "Now
there's a guy who can really double. And you know, Doc Cheatham could
play saxophone too. A lot of people don't know about that. There's
also someone down at the University of Miami who made a big-band
recording in which he played all the parts, except for the drums."</TE>
<TE>   None of the above, however, has performed at Carter's world-class
level of musical invention. A strong and imaginative trumpeter, he
was even more effective as an alto saxophonist, carving out his own
style at a time when his contemporary, Johnny Hodges, was rapidly
becoming a primary influence in the jazz world.</TE>
<TE>   "Hodges was just a bit older than I was [in fact, only a few
weeks]," says Carter, "but his playing never had any particular
effect upon me. I listened a lot more closely to Frankie Trumbauer."</TE>
<TE>   The reference sounds on target, given Trumbauer's focused,
centered tone on the C-melody saxophone--similar in timbre to
Carter's alto saxophone style. And Carter recalls, with a chuckle, an
incident in which he and tenor saxophonist Flip Phillips warmed up
for a concert by romping in unison through Trumbauer's classic solo
on "Singin' the Blues."</TE>
<TE>   A Man Who 'Just Played'</TE>
<TE>   When queried about a subject beyond his immediate factual
knowledge, Carter, who is seemingly without guile, simply responds
with "I really don't have an answer for that." Occasionally, he
ponders for a moment before replying, clearly concerned with
precisely expressing his thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Referring back to the area of influences upon his instrumental
work, for example, he adds, "In all honesty, I think I just played
what I felt was right for me. And I think I would have done the same
thing, even if I'd been born later, when Charlie Parker was
influencing everybody. The truth is, I never gave it much thought. I
just played what I had to play."</TE>
<TE>   He is similarly modest about the long list of accomplishments that
followed his move to Los Angeles in the '40s. In 1952 and 1953, he
played an important role in the amalgamation of the black Musicians
Union Local 767 into the then all-white Local 47--a pioneering event
in the long process of desegregating American Federation of Musicians
locals around the country.</TE>
<TE>   As a composer and arranger, he provided the music for dozens of
television shows (including "M Squad") and feature films ("Stormy
Weather," "A Man Called Adam," etc.), and orchestrated for singers
ranging from Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald to Lou Rawls and Ray
Charles, while continuing to tour, record and concertize with various
groups of his own.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the walls of his study are so crowded with testimonial
plaques to his achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, sitting quietly, smilingly insists that he is "really not
a good interview." But that's true only if one is seeking the sort of
sensationalism that has often surrounded the jazz world rather than
the soft-spoken insights that he has to offer. Why, for example, did
Ken Burns, despite having interviewed him extensively, find so little
of Carter's accumulated knowledge worthy of inclusion in his massive
jazz documentary?</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot that's valuable in what he did," Carter says in
typically courteous fashion. "But I don't understand why there's such
a need to emphasize all the darker aspects of jazz. It was the same
with that Clint Eastwood film, 'Bird.' I didn't know Charlie Parker
well, but I spent some time with him, and he was articulate and well
spoken with a lot of curiosity about music and the world. But the
only way he seems to be depicted is as a junkie. And that's not the
full picture."</TE>
<TE>   He frowns, shakes his head and recalls participating in a European
concert in the '80s, when trumpeter Chet Baker threw his horn to the
ground in the middle of a set.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose it had something to do with not being able to express
what he wanted to on his horn," says Carter. "Or maybe it was just a
drug episode. Either way, it was so very sad to see such a marvelous
talent in that sort of emotional and physical condition. But I don't
think we should concentrate on that. I think we should concentrate
upon all the players who lead fairly normal lives and do the best
they can to play their music."</TE>
<TE>   And what about Carter himself, one wonders. Will he ever again
entertain his numerous fans with a new instrumental excursion, on
either of his two instruments?</TE>
<TE>   Carter finally loses his soft-spoken demeanor for a few beats.
Sitting up, eyes flashing, banging his cane on the floor, he raises
his voice a level and pointedly concludes, "Oh no. Not a chance. I'm
retired!"</TE>

<HD>CBS Makes Case for Big 3 News</HD>
<DH>Television* Network says more viewers tune in broadcasters
than 24-hour stations. CNN disagrees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>CBS News, trying to counter the overwhelming amount of media
attention that goes to cable news networks, went on the offensive
Thursday to assert that broadcast network news retains "overwhelming
dominance" among viewers.</LD>
<LD>   The network put out a press release noting that the three
half-hour evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC collectively reached
about 34.7 million unique viewers a night and 74.9 million unique
viewers a week in the 2001-02 TV season. That was more than five
cable news networks combined--CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, CNN
Headline News and CNBC--reached in a day or week with their entire
24-hour schedules, CBS said, citing Nielsen Media Research figures.</LD>
<LD>   CBS said the five cable networks combined reached just 3.2 million
viewers during the half-hour that the broadcasters are programming
evening news. During their 24-hour period, the cable networks
combined reach 31.2 million unique viewers a day and 74.1 million
viewers a week, CBS said.</LD>
<TE>   "When you look at a direct comparison of the numbers, they clearly
tell the story," CBS News spokeswoman Sandy Genelius said.</TE>
<TE>   The CBS offensive comes on the heels of an aggressive CNN sales
pitch of its own, in which it has been making the case to advertisers
that cable has for the first time surpassed broadcasters by another
measure: the total time spent viewing news.</TE>
<TE>   CNN said that it couldn't immediately confirm or deny the CBS
figures but reiterated its claims about total viewing. For example,
in the second quarter of 2002, CNN said, the five cable networks
grabbed 57.5% of news viewing, compared with 42.5% for broadcasters.
A year ago, CNN said, cable drew just 48.6% of news viewing while
broadcast drew 51.4%.</TE>
<TE>   CNN's measure excluded broadcasters' prime-time newsmagazines,
such as NBC's "Dateline."</TE>
<TE>   "The point we're making is, [total viewing] is not what the real
issue is," said David Poltrack, CBS' head of research. "The issue is,
where do people turn for news? And it's to the broadcast networks
when the broadcast networks are broadcasting news."</TE>
<TE>   Cable is growing in terms of total viewing, he said, because of a
small group of news enthusiasts who spend long hours with both cable
and broadcast news. The majority of Americans, he said, "watch news
on network television."</TE>
<TE>   CBS might not be on the offensive if it had been successful in
talks held during the last couple of years with CNN about a possible
collaboration. ABC also talked to CNN.</TE>
<TE>   An ABC News spokesman applauded the CBS effort, noting, "It puts
the news competition into its proper perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, NBC News President Neal Shapiro, whose network owns
cable's CNBC and co-owns MSNBC, said that "it's great to know so many
viewers congregate for a half-hour event each night.... At the same
time, I think cable is an incredibly important part.... Viewers want
different things and I'm glad we have both."</TE>
<TE>   Fox News said it had no comment.</TE>

<HD>Out-of-Town Shows in Tryouts: Are They Fair Game for
Critics?</HD>
<DH>Stage* New York media once let productions warm up for
Broadway out of sight. But lately the gentleman's agreement has been
breached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS JONES</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Moss Hart's 1948 comedy "Light Up the Sky," a group of paranoid
producers labor out of town trying to fix a flawed but embryonic
Broadway show before it moves to New York. The tryout is taking place
in Boston--but for all that the principals notice about the outside
world, it might as well be taking place on the moon.</LD>
<LD>   Hart was writing from his own experience. Throughout Broadway's
roughly 100-year history, the out-of-town tryout has been a cherished
tradition. Even though pre-Broadway runs usually sell tickets close
to Broadway prices, it has been axiomatic for years that major New
York critics give shows a free pass until the official Broadway
openings. Conventional wisdom has held that big shows need and
deserve time to get their acts together.</LD>
<LD>   But that safe zone is eroding fast. Some say it has disappeared
altogether.</LD>
<TE>   Consider the experience of "Movin' Out," the Twyla Tharp
dance-oriented musical based on the songs of Billy Joel that's
currently in out-of-town previews at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Post sent its theater reporter, Michael Riedel, to
cover the Chicago opening July 19 (the show began previews for paying
audiences June 25; New York previews begin Sept. 30). While Riedel
did not formally review the show, he let his readers know that he
thought the piece was in trouble. "Any reader with half a brain,"
Riedel said, "could tell what I thought."</TE>
<TE>   Broadway.com, one of the many new Web sites covering theater news
and gossip, provided pungent excerpts of Chicago critics' reviews for
its national audience of theater fans. Of course, in this age of the
Internet, interested parties now can pick the reviews up from the
publications' Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Newsday, which is a Tribune Co. newspaper (along with
the Los Angeles Times) and has access to material by Chicago Tribune
reporters and critics, published theater critic Michael Phillips'
Chicago Tribune review last week.</TE>
<TE>   Since that broke the standard practice of New York-area papers not
reviewing out-of-town tryouts, there have been howls of protest from
New York producers. Phillips' overall reaction (like that of many
other local critics) was that the musical, especially the first act,
had problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was despicable for Newsday to pick up that review,"
said Barry Weissler, a Broadway producer with no direct connection to
"Movin' Out." "A show is in such a vulnerable situation when it opens
out of town. That was a low blow."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bad precedent," said James L. Nederlander Jr., one of the
producers of "Movin' Out." "It was not cool."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Kushner, entertainment editor for Newsday, sees the
situation differently. "There's a lot of interest in Billy Joel here
in New York," she said. "We ran the review because it was news."</TE>
<TE>   Riedel, who argues that the idea of an anonymous out-of-town
tryout now is "dead and gone," says that the protests would never
have come if the review in question had been more positive.</TE>
<TE>   "During the tryouts, shows try to create as much hype and positive
buzz as possible," Riedel said, arguing that it's only fair and
reasonable for journalists to provide an outside assessment of the
veracity of that buzz.</TE>
<TE>   "They sell tickets in New York ahead of time," Riedel said. "To
ask those of us who cover New York theater to sit on our hands over a
$10-million musical until opening night in New York is absurd."</TE>
<TE>   In actuality, there are many other examples of New York newspapers
covering out-of-town shows. The New York Times reviewed "Sunset
Boulevard" in Los Angeles. And even though "Hollywood Arms" at
Chicago's Goodman Theatre was widely assumed to be a pre-Broadway
engagement, no one had any problem with New York critics filing
reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some see this issue as a matter of mainstream journalistic
ethics--which require reporting the news without regard to so-called
"gentlemen's agreements"--bumping up against the notion that artists
deserve and require some nurturing.</TE>
<TE>   "For genuine, creative theater to come into New York, it has to be
developed out of town," said Michael Janeway, director of the
National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University. "I think
it's perfectly legitimate for New York theater people to say that
there is a tradition that should be respected."</TE>
<TE>   "They're only looking for a sense of fair play," said Robert
Simonsen, a New York-based reporter for Playbill On-Line. "There
seems to be more and more interest in the theater press in filing a
juicy story about a show out of town. There's a lot of piling on.
They should give these shows a chance to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Following the Newsday publication of the Tribune review, the
show's local representatives put out the word that if the practice
continues, Chicago will lose its growing reputation as a major tryout
town for Broadway shows.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Nederlander said that was not true.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd come back to Chicago in a second," he said. "We came to
Chicago to work on the show and we are not going to stop until we
leave. We got some reviews in the middle of that process and much of
it was constructive criticism. It's water under the bridge. We're all
moving on."</TE>

company.</TE>

<HD>'Full Frontal': Less Overhead, and Drama</HD>
<DH>Steven Soderbergh uses a small budget and quick shooting
schedule in his back-to-basics production, but it's the script and
story that get left behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his
actors turns out to be cleverer, better written and of considerable
more interest than the finished film, that's a bad sign. A very bad
sign.</LD>
<LD>   The guidelines came to light because of how director Steven
Soderbergh shot "Full Frontal." Needing, he's told interviewers, a
change of pace from recent logistics-heavy studio films such as
"Ocean's Eleven," Soderbergh wanted his next film to be as close to
the bone as possible. That translated into a brief 18-day shoot done
primarily with a hand-held digital video camera on unlit locations.</LD>
<LD>   So the actors, who included such names as Julia Roberts, would
understand what they were getting into, Soderbergh crafted his
amusing 10-point memo, which told the cast they were responsible for
their own transportation, costumes, hair and makeup and included the
following stipulations:</LD>
<TE>   "If you are unable to drive yourself to the set, a driver will
pick you up, but you will probably be the subject of ridicule."</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no trailers. If you need to be alone a lot, you're
pretty much screwed."</TE>
<TE>   "You will have fun whether you want to or not."</TE>
<TE>   From a technical point of view, "Full Frontal," with a rough,
ragged, grainy look that intentionally doesn't resemble film, is of
interest, and Soderbergh's willingness to try something different is
certainly understandable and even commendable.</TE>
<TE>   But, perhaps because the physical challenges captivated him to the
exclusion of everything else, Soderbergh has failed to understand or
even notice how undernourished, pretentious and completely devoid of
dramatic heft "Full Frontal" is. His cast might have had fun, but
audiences won't be in the same position.</TE>
<TE>   The first produced screenplay by playwright and poet Coleman
Hough, a friend of the director's, "Full Frontal" takes us through 24
hours in the L.A. life of some truly tedious people, all of them
connected to the movie business and each one less interesting than
the one who came before.</TE>
<TE>   Francesca (Roberts) and Calvin (Blair Underwood) are movie stars
acting in a new film called "Rendezvous." It was scripted by the team
of Carl (David Hyde Pierce), a writer for Los Angeles magazine, and
Arty (Enrico Colantoni), a theater director who is directing an actor
playing Hitler (Nicky Katt) in a play called "The Sound and the
Fuhrer."</TE>
<TE>   Carl is afraid he's boring his wife, Lee (Catherine Keener), a
corporation's vice-president for human resources who believes in
torturing employees before she fires them. Lee's sister, Linda (Mary
McCormack), is a masseuse who's had a hard time sustaining a
relationship. And almost all these people are looking forward to a
40th birthday party for Gus (David Duchovny), "Rendezvous' " powerful
producer.</TE>
<TE>   One of the conceits of "Full Frontal" is that it cuts back and
forth between these videoed stories and sleek 35-millimeter footage
of "Rendezvous," an equally tiresome tale of the relationship between
a journalist (played by Roberts' character) sent to interview a TV
star transitioning into movie roles (played by Underwood's
character).</TE>
<TE>   While this movie-within-a-movie stuff is minimally involving, it
also creates a sense of confusion as to who is exactly who at any
given moment. But with dialogue that sounds painfully improvised and
a story line that pointlessly meanders among self-involved people and
their secondhand thoughts, it mostly seems not worth the effort to
clear up the misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the most noteworthy thing about "Full Frontal" is the
insider nature of some of the casting. It's diverting to see an
uncredited Brad Pitt as an action star, to watch veteran producer
Jerry Weintraub masquerading as a magazine editor, to see David
Fincher playing a director and have director Soderbergh show up with
his face blacked out by a big black square. There's even a character,
played by Jeff Garlin, called "Harvey, probably," an homage to
Miramax topper Harvey Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   These pleasures, such as they are, are fleeting in nature. So much
so that when Keener's character pleads near the close, "I just want
this day to end," there's no one who's lasted through this exercise
in banality who won't second that emotion.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and some sexual content. Times
guidelines: sexual situations photographed through opaque glass.</TE>

<HD>Carvey Comedy Is 'Master' of Very Little</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Master of Disguise" sounds as if it should be a natural for Dana
Carvey, who has created a gallery of hilarious characters and
impersonations on "Saturday Night Live" and elsewhere. But even his
protean talent can't dent this ponderously unfunny and uninspired
comedy. It's hard to imagine anyone older than 10 being diverted by
its broad buffoonery, and kids deserve better than this in the first
place</LD>
<LD>   It's even harder to imagine that Carvey is actually credited with
co-writing the script (with Harris Goldberg), but it's true. Anyway,
Carvey is Pistachio, a nerdy waiter in his father's Italian
restaurant apparently in New York's Little Italy (but clearly on a
studio back lot). Pistachio has a compulsive habit of mimicking the
restaurant's patrons, but his father Frabbrizio (James Brolin), who
emigrated from Palermo with his family in 1979, has never told his
son that they come from an ancient line of masters of disguise, crime
fighters as effective as Superman. But a close call in the guise of
Bo Derek--don't ask--left Frabbrizio eager to pursue less risky work.</LD>
<TE>   The bad guy, Bowman (Brent Spiner), whom Frabbrizio packed off to
prison, has served his sentence and is out for revenge. When
Frabbrizio is kidnapped by Bowman and Frabbrizio's wife (Edie
McClurg) is diabolically endangered as well, it's time for
Pistachio's Grandfather (Harold Gould) to pop up and teach his
grandson the tricks of the ancient House of Disguisey. This is the
premise for the series of clunky, witless adventures Pistachio has
with his glamorous, newly hired assistant (Jennifer Esposito)</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably little that Carvey does in his various disguises is
even faintly amusing. Gould frenetically goes over the top, but
Brolin wisely takes a more relaxed approach and comes up with the
best semblance of an Italian accent of the three. Not much of
Esposito is demanded beyond looking good, which she does, and Spiner
is stuck in a stock villain part who has a chronic affliction that
could well be taken as symbolic of a picture that is such a stinker.</TE>
<TE>   It is not entirely surprising to learn that first-time filmmaker
Perry Andelin Blake, who directs with a sledgehammer touch, has been
a production designer. The film, which mercifully runs but 80
minutes, has an artificial fantasy look that is more amusing and
imaginative in its baroque gaudiness than in any other of its
aspects. "Disguise the limit" is the film's punning promotional
slogan, but "Rock Bottom" is more like it.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for mild language and some crude humor. Times
guidelines: some violence, considerable crudeness.</TE>

<HD>Latin Grammy Nominee Celia Cruz at Her High-Spirited Best</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was very little jazz and plenty of mambo, salsa and guaguanco
at the Hollywood Bowl during Wednesday's "Latin Jazz Spectacular," a
deceptively named show that nevertheless allowed the audience an
opportunity to experience veteran Cuban singer Celia Cruz at her very
best.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps because her latest album, "La Negra Tiene Tumbao," has
just received four Latin Grammy nominations, the singer was
particularly high-spirited, delivering her most dynamic local
performance in years.</LD>
<LD>   Cruz's harshest critics believe that the diva, whose vocals lack
the power of her glory days with the orchestra Sonora Matancera,
should consider retiring from the stage.</LD>
<TE>   That would be a mistake. Cruz's occasional off-key moments can be
easily forgiven, especially if you consider her passionate
reinterpretations of musty old favorites and the seductive grit of
her weathered voice.</TE>
<TE>   To her credit, she has amassed a catalog of new hits, such as "La
Vida Es Un Carnaval" and "Que Le Den Candela."</TE>
<TE>   Yari More's backing orchestra was tight and inspired, changing
styles from the soulful guarachas of La Sonora Matancera ("El Yerbero
Moderno") to the streetwise vibe of Cruz' Fania years ("Quimbara")
and the hip-hop-informed production of her latest release ("La Negra
Tiene Tumbao's"s title track).</TE>
<TE>   Founded by the sons of bandleaders Machito and Tito Rodriguez, the
Big 3 Palladium Orchestra opened the concert with its effort to
recapture the mambo days of the '50s, when the ensembles of the
leaders' fathers and Tito Puente took turns performing at New York's
legendary Palladium.</TE>
<TE>   But lovingly playing the old charts is not enough to re-create
Machito's exuberant stage persona or Puente's visionary musical
direction. The notes were all there on Wednesday, but the vibrant
spirit of the old mambo was sorely missing.</TE>

<HD>A Big-Screen Shot for 'Dallas'</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Remember the 1980s TV phenomenon "Dallas"? It made show-biz history
in many ways, spawned imitations and created huge stars: Victoria
Principal, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Charlene Tilton and Larry
Hagman as the lovable villain J.R. Ewing. "Dallas" thrived for
years--maybe a bit longer than necessary--but it was hard to let go
of such a winner.</LD>
<LD>   Now Hollywood is abuzz that a tremendous big-screen version of
"Dallas" is in the works. The South Fork ranch will rise again!</LD>
<LD>   So let the casting game begin. How about Matt Damon as Bobby,
Halle Berry as Pam, Reese Witherspoon in the Tilton role as the
boy-crazy Lucy Ewing? Paul Newman could play sturdy patriarch Jock,
and Faye Dunaway the strong but usually placid Miss Ellie. (OK, in
her hands, Miss Ellie would carry on a bit more.)</LD>
<TE>   But I pity the actor who has to fill Hagman's boots. Ditto to
whomever might be chosen for Gray's fabulous dipsomaniac, the
tortured and over-the-top Sue Ellen, wife of J.R.</TE>
<TE>   If only they were still together, we could nominate Billy Bob
Thornton and Angelina Jolie for these roles. He can be appropriately
serpentine and she--like Gray--always looks like a woman on the brink
... of something.</TE>
<TE>   This is all fanciful casting, but, hey, stranger things have
happened. The Thornton-Jolie marriage, for instance.</TE>

<LD>   Mehta: Artists Are</LD>
<LD>   Canceling Stops in Israel</LD>
<TE>   Israel is embroiled in turmoil--not only political, but cultural.
The world's great artists, once staples on the scene, are canceling
plans to appear in a country on high-security alert.</TE>
<TE>   In the current production of the Richard Strauss opera "Salome,"
for instance, eight of the scheduled cast members sent their
regrets--a microcosm of what's happening nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty percent or more of the foreign artists have canceled,"
Zubin Mehta, music director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra,
told the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Israel was once a regular stop for pop music acts such as Madonna,
R.E.M., Santana and Eric Clapton. But it has been more than a year
since a superstar put the country on the itinerary. The Jerusalem
Film Festival drew 60 foreign actors and directors, down from its
usual 200. And the Tel Aviv film festival was canceled this year for
fear no stars would come.</TE>
<TE>   While security is the primary reason for staying away, politics
also factor in. More than 200 painters, photographers and poets
endorsed an Internet petition calling on their peers to "cancel all
exhibitions and other events that are scheduled to go on in Israel"
because "the art world must speak out against current Israeli war
crimes and atrocities."</TE>
<TE>   Although there is little evidence of an anti-Israel boycott such
as the one imposed in South Africa during the apartheid era, a
pervasive sense of isolation reigns.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel is not the flavor of the month, that's for sure," Mehta
said. "The world is turning against it."</TE>
<TE>   New York Magazine Drops Dance Column</TE>
<TE>   Tobi Tobias, dance writer at New York magazine for the past 22
years, got a call from editor in chief Caroline Miller Tuesday night
advising her that her column was being phased out.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that she's being replaced by "someone cuter," the
columnist said Thursday. She's just the latest victim of economics,
in which the arts--and dance, in particular--are increasingly seen as
expendable.</TE>
<TE>   "New York City is a mecca for dance--and there are so few slots
where dance is being covered in a steady and serious way," Tobias
said. "Companies and artists--not just the people who report on
them--are trying to find and retain an audience. Dance is seen as the
'orphan' art since its appeal is narrower than the others. Still, it
needs to have its place."</TE>
<TE>   Tobias has received a couple of dozen phone calls and nearly 100
e-mails since word got out. But the decision, it seems, is final.</TE>
<TE>   "While we value Tobi's contribution, I decided not to renew her
contract," Miller said. "But we're not abandoning dance. At least for
the time being, we'll cover it through listings, features and reviews
written by other staff people. In these difficult times, every
publication in America has to make painful decisions about how to use
limited resources in a way that best serves the readers. And it's no
surprise to anyone that the audience for dance has diminished."</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Ozzy's Wife Sends Him Back on the Road</TE>
<TE>   Heavy metal maestro Ozzy Osbourne has canceled plans to take a
three-week break from touring while his wife and manager of 20 years
receives treatment for colon cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "After attending his wife Sharon's first chemotherapy treatment,
he nearly passed out and had to be taken to a recovery room," his
publicist said Thursday. "Sharon now realizes that Ozzy is better off
on the road, so she's shipped him back out to finish Ozzfest."</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne, founding member of Black Sabbath, is headlining the
annual road show of hard rock acts. He'll miss two dates in Ohio
before resuming a month-long trek in Clarkston, Mich., on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Carol Marin to Host</TE>
<TE>   PBS Pilot on Ethics</TE>
<TE>   Veteran news anchor Carol Marin made headlines in 1997 when she
resigned from NBC-owned WMAC-TV in Chicago after the station hired
Jerry Springer for on-air commentaries--an instance in which
principle won out over profit in broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   After stints as a correspondent on "60 Minutes II" and an anchor
for another TV station in Chicago, Marin has found gainful employment
again. She'll be the host of the pilot for a possible prime-time PBS
series: "Endgame: Ethics and Values in America," airing Sept. 18.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot will focus on the question, "Do you turn in someone
who's close to you when you know they've done something wrong?" Among
the guests: the brother of Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Following concerts at the Hollywood Bowl last month and Verizon
Wireless Amphitheater Sept. 15, The Who will play its smallest Los
Angeles venue in decades when it headlines the Greek Theatre on Sept.
17. Tickets go on sale Aug. 11.... Alec Baldwin and Ellen DeGeneres
will be the first stars to take over the center square in the
revamped "Hollywood Squares," replacing Whoopi Goldberg.... Jim
Carrey will re-team with Tom Shadyac, who directed him in "Liar Liar"
and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." Carrey will play a disconsolate TV
reporter in the comedy "Bruce Almighty." Jennifer Aniston is the
female lead....A. Alfred Taubman, former chairman of Sotheby's
auction house, has begun a one-year prison term in Minnesota for
fixing art auction prices.</TE>

<HD>Life Shapes Clay in Georges Jeanclos' Sculptures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last summer, Frank Lloyd Gallery staged a breathtaking introductory
show of terra-cotta sculptures by Georges Jeanclos (1933-1997). This
summer, the gallery follows up with another, equally astonishing.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Jeanclos was 13 and beginning an apprenticeship with a
sculptor, he had already had an excessive share of fear and danger
for one lifetime. His family, French Jews threatened with deportation
under the Vichy regime, had gone into hiding, first in a small
village, then in the woods nearby. Jeanclos emerged from this
nightmare with remarkable talent and direct contact with life's
extremes. His mature work evolved from his experiences during those
formative years, his encounter with Etruscan terra-cotta funerary
sculpture, and his immersion in Jewish worship and study.</LD>
<LD>   What persisted, in his faith and in his work, was, in his words, a
"certain transcendent image of the individual." The figures in
Jeanclos' sculptures bear expressions of complete calm, whether
seeking shelter in a cocoon of makeshift rags or sitting,
Buddha-like, in meditation. They always appear in some sort of
enclosure, their vulnerability tempered by a wrapping of blankets
(the "Dormeurs" or Sleepers), a slightly harder, vessel-like shell
(the "Urnes") or broad, wave-textured cloak (the Japanese-influenced
"Kamakura" series).</LD>
<TE>   Jeanclos forced a weathering process on his clay by hurling it in
slabs onto the ground, where it would stretch thin, crack and pick up
stray bits of debris. His textures speak of honest imperfection. They
are often crusty, parched, but occasionally fluid, smoothly striated
like the waves raked into Japanese dry gardens. Throughout, the clay
doubles as the stuff of life and its humble protection.</TE>
<TE>   In "Couple Dormeur" (circa 1977), two figures huddle in a primal
bed, their intimacy and unity more than compensating for their shabby
coverings. In another piece, the head of an urn figure emerges from
its rippled, fissured sheath cradled in its own hands. Jeanclos'
figures are ever striving to stay warm, to keep in the spiritual
heat. It's this soul protection, as much as the insulation of the
body, that preserves life. Jeanclos knew that survival was more than
a matter of just keeping the breath going. It meant defying forces of
violence, coarseness and disunity, countering with tenderness, grace,
delicacy, beauty. For all of its fragility, Jeanclos' work epitomizes
that magnificent defiance.</TE>

Monica, (310) 264-3866, through Aug. 24. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Sculptor Finds the Mystery in Reality</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy closes her eyes on the familiar domesticity of Aunt Em's
farm, only to open them to the radiance of Oz. Stepping into their
grandfather's wardrobe, the children in C.S. Lewis' classic tales
suddenly find themselves in another, more marvelous world. Is it
possible that these characters were transported to alternate worlds,
or did they simply tap into new ways of regarding existing reality,
recognizing its inherent enchantment, drama, intrigue?</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Niederlander's creepily seductive work at 2211 Solway
Jones spurs a similar train of thought. Her sculptures bridge
pedestrian reality and its wondrous underbelly of fear and fantasy.
Working in plastic, porcelain, foam, cardboard and various forms of
lighting, she rubs the magical up against the mundane. Sparks don't
always fly, but the work generates a consistent, low-level buzz of
curiousness.</TE>
<TE>   "Treehouse," for instance, hangs from the ceiling like a
Frisbee-style light fixture, common enough in a modern home or
office. But instead of hosting a bulb that illuminates a given space,
the fixture disgorges a mass of pale roots, thick, gnarly knobs and
long, dangling strands shaped of modeling compound. A spray of fiber
optic lights twinkles kitschily within, while LEDs tucked inside the
tangle lend the roots a more evocative, burnished glow. It's an odd,
subterranean vision brought to eye level.</TE>
<TE>   "Nitelite," a group of 10 tabletop sculptures, presents a similar
disjunction. The nightlight's primary task is to eliminate mystery.
These amplify it. Each blue plastic dome houses a miniature landscape
of spores and blossoms, tendrils, tresses and fine, curling cilia. A
small aperture atop each dome allows us to peer into these tableaux
(again made of modeling compound), and the lights within make the
shapes visible also as haunting shadows on the domes' exterior walls.
There's a childlike charm to the forms, which look as if they were
shaped from Play-Doh, but that innocence competes with a more
threatening, nightmarish quality. "The wood is full of shining eyes /
The wood is full of creeping feet / The wood is full of tiny cries /
You must not go to the wood at night," reads the Henry Treece poem
upon which this work is based.</TE>
<TE>   We can never see things purely, but only as filtered through our
hopes and anxieties. Niederlander reinforces this notion of
perception as tempered and limited by letting us see the microcosmic
realms in her work only incompletely, from a distance, through tiny
viewing holes or distorting lenses. Where our senses leave off,
though, our imagination is more than happy to take over.</TE>
<TE>   Gallery 2211 Solway Jones, 2211 N. Broadway, L.A., (323) 276-9662,

<TE>   Portraits That Dignify the People We Overlook</TE>
<TE>   Dan McCleary's portraits are the products of long stares at people
in places generally dismissed with a quick glance--counter help at
the doughnut shop, fast food cashiers, strangers in an elevator.
McCleary encourages our prolonged gaze into his subjects' faces by
deflecting it off of everything else in the scene. The men and women
in his modestly elegant new paintings at Michael Kohn Gallery have
the presence and self-possession of true individuals, while their
settings are reduced to generalities.</TE>
<TE>   In "Marta," for instance, a woman stands behind a counter with
arms folded. It's not clear what type of business is transacted here,
for McCleary sands down all the details that would tell us. The
counter looks like gray Formica, the wall behind her is a standard
beige. A brochure holder on the counter contains generic stand-ins of
solid blue and red. A corner of the wall sign identifying the company
frames Marta on one side, and a rubber plant peeks in from the other.
McCleary deftly establishes an institutional feel to the place,
painting every surface slippery smooth with anonymity. Marta, though,
breathes--a present-day counterpart to Manet's woman working the bar
at the Folies Bergere. Manet, Hopper and Vermeer are historical
mentors whom McCleary admires for their restraint. His own work has a
pronounced stillness, a grace that owes as much to his muted color
harmonies as to the introspective demeanor of his subjects. McCleary
seems to have pushed the pause button on these young men and women,
and captured them in a moment of interiority. Gazes between figures
in a painting never lock. A cashier looks intently at his customer,
but she lowers her eyes to the vague space between them.</TE>
<TE>   In "Level Seven," a man and woman stand at either side of an
elevator car, each accompanying a folder or package to be delivered.
She holds the door open and they both stare straight out at us, as if
awaiting our move. These are ordinary situations, but McCleary's
affectionate touch makes it clear that the concept of ordinariness
has no bearing when it comes to people. Each has a dignity that
McCleary more than ably captures.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 79, French pantomime paragon Marcel Marceau still has the power to
redefine theater in his own image. In an age of relentless
amplification, he gives us the wonder of silence. In an age of
numbing literalism, he conjures up the magic of metaphor. In an age
when every facet of meaning is desperately heightened and oversold,
he dares to make demands on an audience.</LD>
<LD>   Watch him closely at the Geffen Playhouse--where he opened a
19-day engagement on Wednesday--or you might miss something sublime.
You might enjoy only the easy, funny stuff--the endearing lion-tamer
routine, for instance, in which he can't get his big cat to jump
through a hoop.</LD>
<LD>   Slip into the way you normally gaze at movies or TV, and you'll be
lost when Marceau takes on those subjects and feelings that so much
entertainment is designed to keep at bay--the way, for example, that
he physicalizes the duality of human nature by making his left hand
humane and even spiritual, but the right hand carnal and violent. Who
else can make a simple walk convey the sense of life lived too
quickly and death ticking inside us with every step? Who else can
make us laugh at the desperation of a street musician, yet turn his
fate into a chilling parable about the corruption of art?</LD>
<TE>   Forget the bland sentimentality of white-faced street mimes in our
malls and parks. Except when he's portraying children, love of life
is usually hard-won or short-lived in the theater of Marcel Marceau.
It might surface only after he fails to successfully shoot, stab,
poison, hang and gas himself in "Bip Commits Suicide," or in Adam's
enchantment with Eden just before he eats that apple in "The Creation
of the World."</TE>
<TE>   Marceau's hands are unforgettable in this adaptation of "Genesis,"
swimming through primordial seas, fluttering in a new-minted sky,
growing up from the earth to become forests and slithering as the
snake that tempts Adam to his downfall. Facially, Marceau makes the
evening into a gallery of comic arrogance, with each smirk or scowl
individually etched, whether he's impersonating a strolling dandy in
"The Public Garden," a manipulative naturalist in "The Bird Keeper"
or a posturing prosecutor in "The Trial."</TE>
<TE>   The interplay of hands, face and torso becomes especially deft in
his "Travels by Sea" sequence, when the swaying and rolling of a ship
makes his body fold up into itself, preventing him from taking a
drink, kissing a lady or walking where and how he likes.</TE>
<TE>   As always, the ship may be invisible, but Marceau's movement makes
it utterly real. It's like a close-up in a film; we accept the
out-of-frame environment unquestioningly. A dog pulling him on a
leash has force, balloons he holds on a string have lift, the whole
physical world can be invoked or banished, as he chooses.</TE>
<TE>   He divides the program into "Pantomimes of Style" and "Pantomimes
of Bip," the latter exploring the misadventures of a character he
created at age 23. At the Geffen, however, the pantomimes of Bip have
plenty of style and the pantomimes of style have plenty of Bip. But
the style segments are generally colder, more risky or profound,
while Bip offers human comedy at its most winsome and sly.</TE>
<TE>   Assistants Gyongyi Biro and Alexander Neander introduce each
segment in an older, more formal kind of mime than the one Marceau
embodies, reminding us of the noble tradition he belongs to--and has
transformed.</TE>
<TE>   The down-and-out characters in "Soliloquy of Three Lost Souls,"
for instance, belong more to silent film realism than classic French
mime. But Marceau has mastered wordless acting so completely that he
can adopt a grittier style here and even retell the same story three
ways or, rather, in three mime "voices," and make us eager for more.</TE>
<TE>   These days, longevity and publicity alone can make you something
of a legend in the entertainment world. Longevity and talent can make
you a one-and-only attraction. Add genius and you have Marcel
Marceau, still speaking one of the oldest theatrical languages with
undimmed artistry, immediacy and charm.</TE>

<CX>   Marcel Marceau--The review of Marcel Marceau in Friday's Calendar was
printed with two transposed columns of type. A corrected excerpt
appears on F14 in today's Calendar. In addition, an incorrect closing
date of his run at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood was given in
Thursday's Calendar Weekend and will appear again in Sunday Calendar.
The show continues through Aug. 18.</CX>

Type of Material: Correction</CX>
<CX>   Due to a production error in Friday's Calendar, parts of the third
and fourth paragraphs in Lewis Segal's review of Marcel Marceau's
performance at the Geffen Playhouse were jumbled. The beginning of
the story should have read like this:</CX>
<CX>      At 79, French pantomime paragon Marcel Marceau still has the power
to redefine theater in his own image. In an age of relentless
amplification, he gives us the wonder of silence. In an age of
numbing literalism, he conjures up the magic of metaphor. In an age
when every facet of meaning is desperately heightened and oversold,
he dares to make demands on an audience.</CX>
<CX>      Watch him closely at the Geffen Playhouse--where he opened a
19-day engagement on Wednesday--or you might miss something sublime.
You might enjoy only the easy, funny stuff--the endearing lion-tamer
routine, for instance, in which he can't get his big cat to jump
through a hoop.</CX>
<CX>      Slip into the way you normally gaze at movies or TV, and you'll be
lost when Marceau takes on those subjects and feelings that so much
entertainment is designed to keep at bay--the way, for example, that
he physicalizes the duality of human nature by making his left hand
humane and even spiritual, but the right hand carnal and violent. Who
else can make a simple walk convey the sense of life lived too
quickly and death ticking inside us with every step? Who else can
make us laugh at the desperation of a street musician, yet turn his
fate into a chilling parable about the corruption of art?</CX>
<CX>      Forget the bland sentimentality of white-faced street mimes in our
malls and parks. Except when he's portraying children, love of life
is usually hard-won or short-lived in the theater of Marcel Marceau.
It might surface only after he fails to successfully shoot, stab,
poison, hang and gas himself in "Bip Commits Suicide," or in Adam's
enchantment with Eden just before he eats that apple in "The Creation
of the World."</CX>

<HD>4 Debuts Set for New Season of Music in Historic Sites
Series</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four international ensembles--the Quartetto di Venezia, the Johannes
String Quartet, the Belcea Quartet and Cardinall's Musick--will make
their local debuts during the 30th anniversary season of Chamber
Music in Historic Sites.</LD>
<LD>   The season begins Oct. 25 with the return of the Cologne-based
Auryn Quartet and ends May 4 with the Shanghai Quartet. Both events
will be held at the Doheny Mansion in downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   The series, sponsored by the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's
College, also welcomes back pianist Delores Stevens, who played in
the first concert, in March 1973; the Arden Trio; the Pacifica
Quartet; the California EAR Unit; the King's Noyse with soprano Ellen
Hargis and harpist Andrew Lawrence-King; and violinist Ida Levin.</LD>
<TE>   Four of the 14 sites will be new to the series. The locations
include private homes, churches and ballrooms by architects such as
Robert D. Farquhar, Silas Burns &amp; Sumner Hunt, Alfred F. Rosenheim,
and Fisher, Lake and Traver.</TE>
<TE>   During the season, the series will return to the Second Church of
Christ Scientist, the Blossom Room at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel,
the Canfield-Moreno Estate and the Crystal Ballroom of the Regal
Biltmore Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The events are designed to explore relationships between music and
place, with an emphasis this season on four neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The Vernon/Central neighborhood will be featured in an appearance
by James Moody at the Dunbar Hotel. An EAR Unit concert will be given
at SCI-Arc's downtown industrial neighborhood. A Latin jazz concert
will take place at the East L.A. restaurant to which Mexican artist
Tamayo gave his name and some of his own artworks. And a concert at
St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral will offer an opportunity to
explore the Byzantine-Latino quarter at Pico Boulevard and Normandie
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Eight separate series are offered. In the Nakamichi series, for
instance, the Orlando Consort plays a program titled "Sounds
Delicious" at the Ebell of Los Angeles, while the Budapest Strings
and the King's Noyse perform in different hotel settings. The
three-concert Premium series offers performances by violinist Ayako
Yoshida, guitarist Paul Galbraith and the Johannes Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the six-concert Doheny Soirees in the evenings, a
new Sunday series called Doheny Matinees will offer three concerts:
the Pacific Quartet; cellist Tanya Tomkins playing Bach on a Baroque
instrument and Britten on a modern cello; and the Shanghai String
Quartet in a Beethoven-Barber-Chinese songs program.</TE>

<HD>A World Gone Mad in Theatricum's 'Chaillot'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The revival of "The Madwoman of Chaillot" at the Will Geer Theatricum
Botanicum couldn't have been better timed. In his classic 1944
comedy, Jean Giraudoux parlayed his varied career as playwright,
essayist and diplomat into a strikingly prescient sociopolitical
vision. Its relevance to current headlines is brilliantly illuminated
in Heidi Helen Davis' staging, though the play's fairy tale
romanticism proves a tougher sell.</LD>
<LD>   Guaranteed to drop jaws is the play's outrageous opening cafe
conversation in which the President (Alan Blumenfeld) enlists a
dissolute Baron (William Hunt) to lend his celebrity stature to the
board of directors of a bogus corporation. Not only does Giraudoux
elegantly skewer the corrupted values of bourgeoisie and aristocracy
alike, but the stock swindle scheme they concoct sounds like a
blueprint for the Enron/WorldCom debacles.</LD>
<LD>   In assured performances, Blumenfeld and Hunt feast on the comic
possibilities of these despicable characters, preying on the
gullibility of little people all too willing to entrust them with
their life savings. But the pair meet their match in Tom Allard's
sardonic turn as a crusty Texas oil prospector who wants to turn
Paris into a vast expanse of oil drills.</LD>
<TE>   Combating the arrayed forces of corporate greed, environmental
pillaging and media spin doctors requires the pure spirit of the
local "madwoman," an eccentric Countess (Ellen Geer) who remains
stubbornly obedient to the voices of her poetic soul.</TE>
<TE>   The feisty, iconoclastic Countess who stirs resistance among the
populace is a perfect fit for Geer. Unfortunately, her exquisitely
malevolent trio of primary opponents exits the stage partway through
the first half, only to return briefly in the finale. In their
absence, the play's energy flags, and it slows to a crawl during some
indulgent sequences that haven't aged as well as the formulation of
the issues. The worst offender is a mock trial in which the Countess
prosecutes the evildoers in absentia, letting one of her own cohorts
speak on their behalf. All that's missing from this court are the
kangaroos.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to some uneven supporting performances among the huge
cast, a number of dropped lines bore the earmarks of a premature
opening, handicapping a work that demands exceptional finesse. Most
in need of burnishing is the theme of failed romance and the folly of
wasted opportunity, the play's most enduring claim to greatness.</TE>

<TE>   The Ghost of Loss Haunts Characters of 'The Weir'</TE>
<TE>   What begins as an ordinary ghost story yields lightning glimpses
of tragedy in "The Weir," now being presented by Theatre Banshee at
the Gene Bua Theatre. Conor McPherson's much-produced play, seen last
year at the Geffen Playhouse, is deceptively simple in structure: a
boozy fireside chat about local haunts and legends--until an
unexpected revelation skews the play in a wrenching new direction.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson understands that any good ghost story requires just the
right setting, and what could be more evocative than an isolated
Irish pub with a good peat fire on the hearth? Arthur MacBride's
meticulously realized set makes it easy to understand why pubs are
alternately referred to as "snugs" in the local idiom, although
MacBride's lighting seems a bit bright for the intended ambience.
Nevertheless, it's an inviting haven, and the winds roaring outside,
courtesy of Erik Hockman and Clayton Tripp's sound design, make it
doubly cozy.</TE>
<TE>   The pub's proprietor, Brendan (Douglas Leal), is an affluent local
landowner and a confirmed bachelor, as are most of his regular
patrons. For Jack (Barry Lynch), an unmarried mechanic, and for Jim
(Dan Harper), a handyman who still lives with his mother, the pub
provides nightly company, not to mention plenty of Guinness--a liquid
buffer against the emotional isolation that is their usual lot.</TE>
<TE>   Into this assemblage of battered yearners comes Valerie (Leslie
Baldwin), an attractive outsider who has just bought a house in the
area. She is escorted by Finbar (Andrew Leman), a married man who
moved to the big city and made a fortune in real estate and the hotel
trade. Brimming with drink and blarney, Jack sets the mood with a
favorite local legend, followed in quick succession by Finbar's and
Jim's ghostly yarns. But through their covert competition for
Valerie's attention, the men have unwittingly set the stage for
Valerie's own shocking disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   In his small but richly humane story about loss and loneliness and
the pitfalls of human love, McPherson accomplishes exactly what he
sets out to do, quietly and efficiently. So does director Sean
Branney, whose marvelous cast strikes just the right half-note
between comedy and bleakness, with lashings of gallows humor to
mitigate the pathos.</TE>
<TE>   If there is any single component given short shrift in Branney's
staging, it's the lustful undercurrents of these men, who seem too
willing to accept Valerie as a sexless new friend. Otherwise, this is
a story well woven, and the performers, particularly Leman and Lynch,
swaddle us in the warm folds of the narrative with consummate and
comfortable skill.</TE>

<TE>   'Sister Mary' Keeps an Eye on Absurdist 'Universe'</TE>
<TE>   Given the current Catholic Church scandals, it seems courageously
logical to conjoin Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius
Explains It All for You" with his "The Nature and Purpose of the
Universe." In doing so, the Rude Guerrilla Theatre Company's
energetic production generates much lethal hilarity.</TE>
<TE>   "Sister Mary" has been a staple since its 1981 premiere, most
recently a teleplay starring Diane Keaton. The title nun (Sharyn
Case) enters in dogmatic lecture mode, with an automaton-like child
assistant (Trevor McKay). Her tirade is interrupted by embittered
former students (Rachel Hirsch, Kelly Stark, Mark St. John and
Stephen Wagner), their warped Nativity pageant tilting the
proceedings into satiric nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Durang's construct remains trenchant, and director Alexander
Rodriguez understands the mordant frivolity required. Case's twisted
sister suggests Patricia Routledge cut with Bea Arthur, and her
colleagues are fine, with Hirsch's pivotal confession superb.</TE>
<TE>   "Universe," which marked Sigourney Weaver's Manhattan debut,
features two divine agents (Aurelio Locsin and Stark, both priceless)
wreaking havoc on Weehawken housewife Eleanor Mann (the daft Deborah
Conroy). Eleanor yearns to escape her awful husband (David Cramer),
offspring (Eric Eisenbrey, Jeff Marx and St. John), interlopers
(Vince Campbell, Jeff Strack and Stark) and malfunctioning
appliances. A papal assassination plot and Icelandic relocation
transpire.</TE>
<TE>   The drawback is imbalance: "Sister Mary" originally followed the
goofy "The Actor's Nightmare," and her alpha positioning here renders
"Universe" anticlimactic. This doesn't rob Durang's absurdist
savagery of its bite, but a reversed order would better serve
accelerating tension.</TE>

<TE>   One-Man Tale of Wright: An Architect's Foundation</TE>
<TE>   "F.LL.W.: The Tragedies &amp; Triumphs of Frank Lloyd Wright," John
Crowther's one-man play about architect Frank Lloyd Wright, holds
considerable historical interest.</TE>
<TE>   One can imagine it playing the college circuit for years and doing
a banner business among architecture students. However, under the
direction of Willard Simms, the premiere production at the Hudson
Avenue Theatre is dry material that never kindles into a blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Crowther had to tamp down a towering inferno of
biographical data into one controlled narrative. Wright's life was as
full of scandal as it was achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Abandoned by his own father in his teens, Wright subsequently left
his first wife and four children, living openly with the wife of a
former client at Taliesin, his fabled hillside home. In the summer of
1914, with Wright away on business, a crazed houseman murdered
Wright's lover and six others, torching Taliesin and leaving Wright's
personal life in ashes.</TE>
<TE>   Crowther's story is set in 1935, at the rebuilt Taliesin, now an
informal institute for architecture students. With his career in
eclipse and a couple of failed marriages behind him, Wright is
working on the plans for Fallingwater--a visionary structure that
will shortly thrust him back to the forefront of his field, where he
will remain until his death in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Although Crowther's performance heats up as it goes along, it's
oddly muted, deficient in the underlying narcissism and salacity that
was part and parcel of Wright. In Simms' staging, Crowther hunkers
over his drafting table for undynamic stretches, relating incidents
from his life to his unseen student-acolytes. His is a thoughtful
Wright, and thoughtfully rendered, but without the flashes of humor
and grandiosity that would have made it a vibrant portrayal of its
flawed and fascinating subject, a man whose lofty edifice of egotism
was one of his most unshakable constructions.</TE>

<HD>A Wiser, More Reflective Martin Lawrence Still Has Comic
Edge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat," the comedian's latest concert
film, was shot in Washington, D.C.'s Constitution Hall, whose use was
once denied to contralto Marian Anderson. Clearly, we've come a long
way since 1939, for as always, Lawrence is a no-holds-barred stand-up
comedian who gets away with the strongest, most graphic language
because he is so funny and because he makes himself the object of so
much of his humor.</LD>
<LD>   "Runteldat," Lawrence's motto, comes from his demand: "Stop the
gossip. I'm still here--run tell that!" Lawrence was involved in some
well-publicized incidents several years ago that have left him with
considerable resentment toward the media and a desire to tell his
side. But Lawrence is too shrewd a showman to lead with them, so he
opens with his views on a wide range of topics. He's all for respect
for elders and living life to the fullest, but gets hilariously down
and dirty when it comes to sex, suggesting among unprintable advice
that in relationships couples would be well advised to take a "test
drive."</LD>
<TE>   After a substantial barrage of jokes and opinions, Lawrence gets
to the nitty gritty. In 1996 Lawrence caused a ruckus when he walked
into traffic at a Ventura Boulevard intersection in Sherman Oaks and
started yelling. He was arrested and subsequently hospitalized for
dehydration and exhaustion. After beginning an explanation that has
him caught in a traffic signal change while rushing to get some
take-out food, he stops abruptly and admits he was high, incredibly
high, on some unbelievably strong marijuana, which he says he has
given up. It didn't help that he was also packing a pistol.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimately far scarier incident occurred three years later
when he suffered severe heat exhaustion as he approached his front
lawn after he had been jogging strenuously. He was in a coma for
three days. Lawrence conveys eloquently the shock his loved ones
experienced and his own surprise once he regained consciousness. He
details the indignities of his recovery with outrageous humor as well
as reverent gratitude toward a kindly nurse.</TE>
<TE>   It seems Lawrence has reflected deeply upon his down periods.
They've left him wiser without dulling the sharp edges of his humor.
At the end of this deftly structured and well-paced concert film,
which was directed by David Raynr, Lawrence concludes with a printed
statement of a declaration he repeats throughout the film: "No one is
immune to the trials and tribulations of life," adding the tag, "We
are all one."</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong crude sexual dialogue and pervasive
language. Times guidelines: The language is exceedingly graphic and
unsuitable for children.</TE>

<HD>A Fun Detour to Roadside Sights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMANTHA BONAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They say getting there is half the fun--or half the horror, depending
on how you feel about roadside attractions. Off-road schlock is the
subject of "Highway Hangouts" at 9 tonight on the History Channel,
part of its weeklong "Hit the Road" programming, with NFL star Jason
Sehorn as host.</LD>
<LD>   In 1900, there were only 144 miles of paved road in the United
States and only 8,000 cars. By 1910, there were 458,000 cars, and
their owners demanded decent roads, places to go and things to see.
They soon got them. Entrepreneurs followed the drivers, and places of
gas, food and lodging quickly sprang up along the highways. Soon,
roadside attractions to lure drivers off the asphalt joined the
battle for the Buick buck.</LD>
<LD>   These early spectacles fell into four main categories: natural
wonders, animals, human curiosities and kid-friendly. Many were
whimsically inventive and fun, such as the underwater mermaid show
still in Weekiwachee, Fla., and an Eskimo dog-sled ride in New
Hampshire. Others were the truly bizarre products of obsessive
loners, such as a monument to the Great Depression made entirely of
trash.</LD>
<TE>   As commentator John Magolies, author of "Fun Along the Road,"
says, the attractions show that "there isn't anything the human mind
can't achieve given the opportunity to run amok." Unfortunately (or
fortunately), the advent of major highways signaled the death of most
of these roadside hangouts.</TE>
<TE>   Although the trip down this memory lane is long and strange, the
documentary keeps viewers' interest with its quick pace, informative
commentary, fun soundtrack of old popular tunes and vintage film
footage, photographs and postcards. The diversity of the attractions
themselves is of endless interest, even the off-color ones that hold
all the fascination of a car wreck. You'll have a hard time looking
away.</TE>

<HD>An Encounter of His 3rd Kind</HD>
<DH>After 'Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' M. Night Shyamalan
delivers the entertaining but fairly long-winded 'Signs.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't let M. Night Shyamalan's success fool you. Just because "The
Sixth Sense" is the 10th-highest-grossing film of all time, don't
think of him as a writer-director of blockbusters. It's just not so.</LD>
<LD>   Shyamalan's latest film, the Mel Gibson-starring "Signs," confirms
what's been hidden in plain sight: He is at heart a maker of quirky,
individualistic, almost handmade supernatural films he writes,
directs, produces and even casts himself in.</LD>
<LD>   The success of "Sixth Sense" and to a lesser degree "Unbreakable"
notwithstanding, Shyamalan actually has more in common with
low-budget horror artist Larry Fessenden ("Habit," "Wendigo") than
someone who might be working for producer Jerry Bruckheimer. He uses
big stars because they're available, but his passion is for putting
his own spin on traditional, even old-fashioned material.</LD>
<TE>   Shyamalan's great gift is the creation of atmosphere, the
conjuring of spooky, unseen menace. When he gets around to doing this
in "Signs," all is well, but it's a tossup as to whether the film
offers enough of a payoff considering how long it takes to get where
it's going.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Shyamalan has other things on his mind this time around,
some better executed than others.</TE>
<TE>   There's a strain of quirky, laconic humor here that is unexpected
but effective. Less successful is the film's main theme, the power
and even the necessity of faith. "Signs" is finally a B picture at
heart, and whatever heartfelt messages the Bs convey is never what's
memorable about them.</TE>
<TE>   The key plot element in "Signs" is the phenomenon known as crop
circles, geometric patterns made in farmers' fields that look
impressive enough to lead some people to think they were made by
aliens (though an article in the current Scientific America details
how easily mere humans can manage the deed).</TE>
<TE>   One such victimized farmer is Graham Hess (Gibson), who wakes up
one morning on his Bucks County acreage 45 miles from Philadelphia to
find a circle in his cornfields. (In reality, circles appear not in
corn but rather wheat, oats or barley, but Shyamalan liked the
maze-like look only cornfields provide.)</TE>
<TE>   Hess' young children, 10-year-old Morgan ("You Can Count on Me's"
Rory Culkin) and 5-year-old Bo (a debuting Abigail Breslin) think God
did it. Hess' younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and Hess
himself think it was the work of rowdy locals Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers. And local peace officer Caroline Paski (Cherry
Jones) frankly doesn't know what to think.</TE>
<TE>   As the investigation continues, we learn more about the Hess
family. Graham Hess, it turns out, is a recent widower who was so
shattered by the accidental death of his wife that he left the
Episcopal priesthood and returned to civilian life. And brother
Merrill has had crises of belief of his own: A powerful minor league
baseball player, he saw his prospects come undone when the records he
set included one for strikeouts as well as one for home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Though his part doesn't sound that exciting, Gibson does some of
his best acting as the disaffected Hess, balancing the presence of a
paterfamilias with the doubts of a damaged soul trying to figure out
what is happening with the world.</TE>
<TE>   While the adults in "Signs" are pursuing rational leads, the kids
have ideas of their own. The wonderfully earnest Morgan purchases a
book on UFOs and alien invasions and somberly reads it as if it was a
U.S. government manual. In one of the film's funnier conceits, he
makes himself a helmet out of tinfoil to prevent aliens from reading
his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Although this kind of droll humor, which makes us wonder whether
the end of the world might well come as farce, is entertaining, it's
not enough to distract us during the too-long time it takes for
"Signs" to show and tell us what is causing these circles. (Not that
anyone will have much doubt, even without the film's referencing of
H.G. Wells' classic "War of the Worlds.")</TE>
<TE>   Once its actual action kicks in, "Signs" is on stronger ground,
holding our attention so well there's no time to think about things
in the plot that don't make a whole lot of sense. It's also true that
the bromides about faith the film thinks are profound don't end up
playing that way. Still, as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi
movies, "Signs" is a tribute to Shyamalan's gifts, which are such
that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for some frightening moments. Times
guidelines: Scare moments are of the traditional variety.</TE>

allegedly fraudulent transactions associated with an air pollution
trading program incorrectly reported that Calpine Corp. had announced
the previous week that problems with the program caused the company
to revise its earnings downward. In fact, Calpine announced the
$11.5-million earnings revision in March, when it said it also had
noted the change in its annual report.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wet Seal Inc., a retailer of clothing for young women and teenage
girls, said its second-quarter profit would miss expectations because
sales have slowed in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The Foothill Ranch-based company said earnings will be 12 cents to
14 cents a share in the quarter ending this week, compared with 12
cents in the year-earlier period. The average forecast of analysts
polled by Thomson First Call was 17 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Wet Seal said sales at stores open at least a year declined in
July partly because of a later back-to-school period in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Wet Seal fell $1.88, to $13.83, on Nasdaq. The shares
had declined 40% since Monday.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency board approved a plan
to invest $42.2 million in public funds for a 22-acre retail and
residential project on the site of the long-struggling Santa Barbara
Plaza in the Crenshaw District.</LD>
<LD>   The funding includes federal housing grants and other subsidies
that are considered crucial to making the $125-million project, known
as Marlton Square, economically feasible, according to public
officials and the developers. The project proposed by Capital Vision
Equities and Keyshawn Capital Development includes 140,000 square
feet of retail space, 140 for-sale houses and 180 units of affordable
senior housing on the site of Santa Barbara Plaza, immediately west
of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   The funding package for Marlton Square, which is backed by Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas,
will be sent to the full City Council for approval.</LD>

<BD>Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guess Inc. on Thursday posted a second-quarter loss and cut its
outlook for the year, citing reduced expectations for both retail and
wholesale businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based apparel company said it had a net loss of
$6.4 million, or 15 cents a share, in the second quarter, contrasted
with a profit of $1.5 million, or 3 cents, in the year-earlier
period.</LD>
<LD>   The loss from operations was $9.4 million, contrasted with
operating earnings of $5.6 million a year ago, Guess said. Net sales
declined 21% to $119.8 million.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue from Guess stores fell 4% to $83.2 million, with sales at
stores open at least a year down 7.4%. Guess said same-store sales
during July probably would be down in the low-to-mid single digits.</TE>
<TE>   The company had lowered its second-quarter outlook on July 3 to a
loss of 16 cents to 18 cents, from a previous forecast of a loss of
12 cents to 14 cents, and said June same-store sales had dropped 6.2%
year-on-year.</TE>
<TE>   Guess said it expects revenue in the second half of 2002 to
decline about 5% from last year's second half. For the full year, it
estimates earnings of 4 to 8 cents, including 8 to 10 cents in the
third quarter and 19 to 21 cents in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Other California companies reporting earnings:</TE>
<TE>   *  DaVita Inc., an operator of dialysis centers, reported net
income of $8 million, or 13 cents a share. The Torrance company said
excluding one-time gains and losses, its earnings were $35 million,
or 41 cents, for the quarter ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   *  Rubio's Restaurants Inc. reported a 41% jump in second-quarter
net income to $1.13 million, or 12 cents a share, beating the
Carlsbad company's guidance of 8 cents to 10 cents. Revenue grew 6.2%
to $30.7 million. Rubio's also raised its profit forecast for the
full year to a range of 24 cents to 27 cents from its previous
guidance of 22 cents to 25 cents. For the third quarter, it expects
earnings of 9 cents to 10 cents, including expenses related to a menu
upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   *  Merisel Inc. reported second-quarter net income of $91,000, or
1 cent a share, helped by adjustments related to the write-down of
its U.S. hardware distribution business, which reduced the cost of
sales by $810,000. In the year-ago quarter, the El Segundo-based
software distributor had a net loss of $24.2 million, or $3.02 a
share, including a $29.4-million charge related to the sale of its
Canadian distribution business. Revenue dropped 85% to $17.8 million</TE>
<TE>   *  Unova Inc. of Woodland Hills reported second-quarter net income
of $22.3 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with a net loss of
$2.8 million, or 5 cents, a year ago. The results in both periods
include several one-time charges and gains. Revenue declined 16%
$355.2 million.</TE>

<HD>Southland's Recovery Slowing, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's recovery appears to be losing steam, according
to an economic report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Southern California Leading Economic Indicator, prepared by
Cal State Fullerton, reported an increase of 0.18% to its index value
after a gain of 0.92% in the first quarter. Although the region's
rebound doesn't yet appear to be in jeopardy, signs point to sluggish
activity for the remainder of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not predicting a huge amount of growth," said economist
Adrian Fleissig, author of the indicator. "This is going to be a very
mild recovery."</LD>
<TE>   Fleissig's index, which he developed two years ago to predict the
health of the Southern California economy, is consistent with other
recent data showing the U.S. recovery is slowing.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that U.S. gross domestic
product grew at an annual rate of 1.1% in the second quarter--about
half of what had been expected and well off the 5% pace of earlier
this year. Likewise, a factory activity index released Thursday by
the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. manufacturing
growth stalled in July after several months of gains.</TE>
<TE>   Some slowing had been expected after a brisk first quarter in
which U.S. businesses restocked their depleted inventories. But
corporate governance scandals and a Wall Street meltdown now appear
to be rattling the confidence of consumers and businesses alike, who
are showing signs of pulling back on spending and investing.</TE>
<TE>   Many economists say a so-called "double-dip" recession is
unlikely. Still, concerns about a near-term slowdown are likely to
inspire caution, particularly when it comes to hiring. So far this
year, California employers have created an average of 600 jobs a
month, compared with 40,500 a month during the boom of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The good news, according to Fleissig, is that his indicator
signals that hiring is likely to show a modest improvement over the
next three to six months.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Leading Economic Indicator projects
regional economic activity for Los Angeles, Orange, San
Bernardino-Riverside, Ventura and Imperial counties. It tracks seven
national and regional components. The national variables are money
supply, interest rates and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index. The
regional components are nonfarm employment, the unemployment rate,
building permits and Pacific-region consumer confidence.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, declines were seen in two of the
indicator's seven components--the S&amp;P 500 index and Southern
California nonfarm employment--while the others increased.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Liberty Media Corp., controlled by billionaire John Malone, agreed to
buy France Telecom's Dutch cable television unit for $733 million,
jump-starting its efforts to expand in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Malone has been prowling for acquisitions as rivals such as France
Telecom struggle to cut debt and others such as NTL Inc. have filed
for bankruptcy protection. Casema marks his first European takeover
since German regulators blocked Liberty Media's purchase of six
Deutsche Telekom networks in February.</LD>
<LD>   Englewood, Colo.-based Liberty Media already controls United
Pan-Europe Communications, the Netherlands' biggest cable TV company
and the second-largest in Europe. Buying Casema will make it twice as
big as its nearest rival in the Netherlands, according to 2001
figures from Dutch industry group Vecai.</LD>

<LD>Time Warner Telecom Inc. had a second-quarter loss as revenue fell
15%. The telephone and Internet-services company said it has enough
money set aside in case WorldCom Inc., its largest customer, fails to
pay its bills.</LD>
<LD>   Time Warner Telecom, 44% owned by AOL Time Warner Inc., had a net
loss of $30.8 million, or 27 cents a share, contrasted with net
income of $4.4 million, or 4 cents, in the year-earlier period, the
company said in a statement. Revenue fell to $184.6 million from
$217.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   The company had $31.1 million set aside as of June 30 to cover
"doubtful accounts" from customers including WorldCom, a telephone
company that filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy case. WorldCom
accounts for 12% of Time Warner Telecom's monthly revenue and owed it
$14.7 million as of June 30. WorldCom buys phone, data and Internet
capacity for its business customers on Time Warner Telecom's
fiber-optic network.</LD>
<TE>   Time Warner Telecom said it had $324 million in cash as of June
30, an increase of $9 million from the first quarter, and is in
compliance with its lending covenants.</TE>

<HD>Fleetwood Enterprises Faces False Advertising Lawsuit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. on Thursday was hit with a consumer's
lawsuit accusing it of false advertising for its motor homes, as the
company warned of another quarterly loss.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, charges that
Fleetwood falsely claims that its motor homes can stop safely while
towing a load of 3,500 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Don Fairley of Long Beach claims in the suit that his Fleetwood
motor home can safely tow an automobile or boat weighing 3,500 pounds
only when its braking system is supplemented. Without modification,
the vehicle can't stop safely with more than 1,000 pounds in tow, the
suit said.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, which seeks class-action status on behalf of an
estimated "tens of thousands" of Fleetwood customers, demands that
the company reimburse consumers or replace the brakes on their
recreational vehicles. The suit also asks for Fleetwood to notify all
customers of the alleged braking-capacity limit.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside-based Fleetwood declined to immediately comment, said
spokeswoman Kathy Munson.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks to represent buyers of both Class C and Class A
Fleetwood motor homes. Class C homes are the smallest motor homes,
according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Assn. Class A motor
homes are the largest vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Fleetwood announced that a drop in sales of
manufactured homes would contribute to an unspecified loss for its
fiscal first quarter. It expects to break even on an operating basis.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of motor homes and travel trailers should be up 39%,
bringing total sales up 8% to $610 million. The year-earlier net loss
was $31.1 million, or 95 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The company has hired Edward Caudill, an executive at truck maker
Paccar Inc., to take over this month as chief executive and president
to replace Nelson Potter, who resigned in February after seven
quarters of losses.</TE>
<TE>   Fleetwood rival Thor Industries Inc. said sales rose 80% for the
fiscal fourth quarter ended July 31 to $402.2 million, while sales
for the year gained 51% to $1.25 billion. The gains include the
acquisition of Keystone RV Co. in December.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Fleetwood, which have declined more than 75% this year,
fell 10 cents to $4.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Global in Talks Over 2 Late Bids</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The ailing company could announce as early as
today that it has reached a deal on a sale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Agents for Global Crossing Ltd. were wrapped in "intense"
negotiations Thursday with two late bidders for its vast fiber-optic
network and other assets as the company tries to work out a deal by
today that will bring it out of the nation's fifth-largest
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The company concluded talks with a third bidder, Los Angeles
buyout specialists Tom and Alec Gores, and turned its full attention
to offers from a group led by former Global President David Walsh and
from one led by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., a
source familiar with the process said.</LD>
<LD>   Other bidders have offered to buy large and small pieces of
Global, and some of those bids may be folded into any agreement for
the sale of the entire company.</LD>
<TE>   The Gores brothers, who operate separate buyout firms, may be out
of the running after reworking their offer to try to satisfy Global's
creditors. Their offer consists of $1.2 billion in cash, notes and
stock for Global creditors and as much as $1 billion more in funding
to operate the Bermuda-based telecommunications company.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations with bidders over the last few weeks have focused on
rearranging and adding to offers, such as providing more cash and
less equity, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Global executives might reveal as soon as today that the company
and its creditors have reached agreement on a sale. Or they could
delay the process again to work out details before submitting their
recommendation to the court, which will consider any deal in a
hearing Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Both Walsh and Hutchison came into the bidding process late,
though Hutchison had been part of a deal to refinance the company
when Global filed a petition in January to reorganize debts totaling
$12.4 billion. That offer was withdrawn when creditors decided it was
inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Global's listed assets of $22.4 billion made it the
fourth-largest corporate failure. WorldCom Inc.'s filing last month
became the biggest ever, bumping Global to fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Both Walsh and Hutchison come to the table with deep pockets, and
all three bidders have experience in telecommunications. Walsh is
backed by Bank One Corp.'s venture capital arm, and Hutchison is
controlled by billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison also was involved in three overseas ventures with
Global's majority-owned subsidiary, Asia Global Crossing Ltd., until
it bought out Asia Global's position earlier this year for $120
million. Cash-strapped Asia Global also is seeking funding.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gores' company, Platinum Equity, could play a key role in
funneling new customers quickly into Global's network, which connects
some 200 cities in 27 countries. Platinum's NextiraOne designs and
manages voice and data systems for some 400,000 corporations
worldwide and could provide incentives to get those customers to
switch to Global's network. Global has 85,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Global, meanwhile, reported its biggest monthly loss and its
lowest sales figure since filing for bankruptcy, according to its
monthly financial report filed with the Bankruptcy Court. But it
managed to add $17 million to its much-needed cash on hand, which
helps it to continue operating.</TE>
<TE>   For June, the company lost $173 million, or 19 cents a share, on
revenue of $250 million. The previous month, it lost $137 million, or
15 cents a share, on sales of $262 million.</TE>

<HD>Market Rally Tripped Up by New Fears</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Treasury bond yields plunge to new lows as
many investors seek stability in government debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks succumbed to renewed selling Thursday, interrupting the
rebound that began a week ago as a triple dose of economic
disappointment heightened worries about the state of the recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury bond yields plunged to new lows as some investors sought
stability in government debt at seemingly any price, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 26.96 points,
or 3%, to 884.66. The loss snapped a four-day winning streak for the
benchmark index--its longest since December. The Dow Jones industrial
average sank 229.97 points, or 2.6%, to 8,506.62, in a sell-off that
accelerated late in the day. Profit warnings in the oil industry
weighed on the blue-chip indexes.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, tumbled 48.26 points, or 3.6%, to
1,280.00, as profit warnings and brokerage downgrades in the tech
sector gave investors more reasons to dump stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing solid evidence that we're getting a lull in the
economy," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at brokerage
Edward Jones in St. Louis. "The recovery is still in place, but it's
modest and uneven."</TE>
<TE>   In active trading, declining stocks outnumbered gainers by about 3
to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Among Treasury securities, the yield on the two-year note fell to
a generational low of 2.12% from 2.23% on Wednesday, reflecting
uncertainty over whether the equity markets will revisit the
multiyear lows they reached July 23. The two-year T-note's previous
low was 2.22%, reached last Friday. The yield on the 10-year note
fell to 4.39% from Wednesday's close of 4.46%.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the dollar weakened to 119.36 Japanese yen
from 119.84 and the euro rose to 98.3 cents from 97.7 cents
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. manufacturing report was among the key triggers for
Thursday's stock sell-off, investment pros said. The Institute for
Supply Management said its monthly manufacturing index dropped more
sharply than expected in July, hitting its lowest level since
January.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the government reported an unexpected drop in
construction spending in June, and the number of jobless claims last
week increased more than forecast. The reports added to the concerns
stoked by Wednesday's news that the nation's gross domestic product
grew much more slowly than expected in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "People are starting to think, 'Forget about the second half of
2002. We have to look to 2003 before things really pick up,' " said
Shelly J. Meyers, Beverly Hills-based manager of the Citizens Value
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Deepening losses in the last hour of stock trading were
discouraging as well, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This market can't seem to get any traction," Meyers said. "The
buyers disappear and the short-term traders won't hold stocks
overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Investors will be watching closely today when the government
releases its report on July employment. Many economists are
predicting that the economy added enough jobs last month to keep the
nation's unemployment rate steady at 5.9%--but not enough to bring
the rate down.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to worrying about the economy, some investors fret
that the rally that lifted the S&amp;P 500 by 14.3% from July 24 through
Wednesday was not justified by valuations based on fundamentals such
as per-share earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Stocks just aren't cheap, even though they should be at a time
like this," said Elliot Blumberg, manager of the Vigilant Investors'
Fund, a Santa Monica-based hedge fund. "Financial statements are in
doubt, and the world is in a widespread tenuous situation."</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The Nasdaq 100 index, which comprises the biggest non-financial
stocks trading on that market, plunged 5% to 913.59, nearing the
five-year low of 894 it set last week. Large tech names led the
decline, which extended Wednesday's losses.</TE>
<TE>   Software maker Adobe Systems plummeted $7.13 to $16.83 after
issuing a profit warning. Cisco Systems slipped $1.09 to $12.10 amid
speculation that its president and chief executive would resign, but
the networking giant denied the rumors, Reuters said.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil stocks were among the biggest losers. Exxon Mobil sank $3.11
to $33.65 after falling short of second-quarter earnings forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   In the oil service sector, Schlumberger lost $3.26 to $39.66,
Noble dropped $1.75 to $30.65 and Baker Hughes fell $1.18 to $25.62.</TE>
<TE>   * In the restaurant industry, Yum Brands fell $2.69 to $28.21
after Goldman Sachs downgraded the fast-food conglomerate, whose
chains include Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Applebee's International
slumped $2.06 to $20.65 after saying this year's profit will be in
line with forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   * Good news helped various stocks buck the down market. Newell
Rubbermaid rose $4.07 to $34.15 after topping second-quarter earnings
expectations, and Williams climbed 85 cents to $3.80 after securing
new loans and saying it is close to settling its energy sales dispute
with the state of California.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of several California community banks rose on the heels
of Wednesday's announcement that El Centro-based banking company VIB
is being acquired. Hawthorne Financial gained 59 cents to $27.99,
East West Bancorp added 31 cents to $34.90 and Cathay Bancorp rose
$2.94 to $39.50. VIB rose 4 cents to $14.86.</TE>
<TE>   * In foreign markets, stocks fell sharply in Europe, sending the
Bloomberg index of 500 European stocks down 3.9%. Key share indexes
fell 4.8% in Britain, 5.1% in France and 2.5% in Germany. In Mexico,
the Bolsa slid 4.4% to a new low for the year.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke Energy Corp. said it fired two employees after reviewing
"improper" energy trades that have become part of an investigation by
federal regulators.</LD>
<LD>   An internal review showed 89 "round-trip" trades out of 750,000
Duke reviewed at the request of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the company said. Duke said 61 of those "did not have a
legitimate business purpose" and were "done at the direction of one
trader."</LD>
<LD>   Round-trip trades are swaps of power at the same price and time,
which can boost trading volume.</LD>
<TE>   The shares of Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke fell 5 cents to $25.44 on
the NYSE. The announcement was made after the market closed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three drugstore chains will temporarily continue to fill Medicaid
prescriptions in Massachusetts in exchange for the state's
reconsidering a planned cut in reimbursement rates.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Jane Swift announced the agreement, temporarily ending an
impasse with CVS, Walgreens and Brooks Pharmacy, which had threatened
to withdraw from the state's Medicaid program because of an 11%
reduction in prescription reimbursement rates.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Walgreen Co. said it may have to pull out of the
Medicaid program in Washington because of a cutback on Medicaid
reimbursements intended to help plug a budget shortfall.</LD>

meet the requirements of its credit facility and generate cash to
expand its business. The company's second-quarter loss from

ago. Sales fell 4.3% to $308.2 million.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. housing became less affordable in the second quarter as higher
home prices offset low mortgage rates, a real estate industry group
said.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Realtors said its housing affordability
index fell to 132.6 in the second quarter from 137.2 in the first
quarter. This means that a typical household in the second quarter
had 132.6% of the income needed to buy a home for the median price in
the quarter, which stood at $157,700.</LD>
<LD>   A family earning the median income of $52,429 could afford a home
costing $209,100, well above the median price, the NAR said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aetna Inc. posted second-quarter results well beyond analysts'
expectations as the health insurer curbed rising costs and dropped
customers who were the most costly to insure. The company also raised
earnings estimates for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Net income was $108.2 million, or 70 cents a share, including
investment gains and a benefit for overestimating prior medical
costs, up from $10.6 million, or 7 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Operating profit, which excludes all one-time items, was $49.3
million, or 32 cents a share, for the quarter that ended June 30,
beating the 25-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue fell 23% to $5.06 billion as membership in health plans
declined.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna benefited from payroll cuts, higher premiums and the
shedding of unprofitable plans, including its government Medicare
business, as well as from forging better deals with hospitals. The
company announced in December that it would cut 6,000 jobs, or 16% of
its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Hartford, Conn.-based company fell 58 cents to
$43.10 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams Cos., which had been driven to the brink of insolvency,
raised $3.4 billion with asset sales and new loans that the pipeline
company expects will ease a cash crunch.</LD>
<LD>   Williams said it got $1.4 billion by selling two pipelines and
some U.S. natural-gas reserves, and $900 million in secured loans
from investors led by Lehman Bros. Inc. and Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The company also got a $1.1-billion credit
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The money will buy Williams time as it works to restructure
businesses after the collapse of energy trading and falling power
prices eroded earnings and investor confidence, analysts said. The
Tulsa, Okla.-based company's options dwindled after its credit rating
was cut to "junk," it posted a second-quarter loss of $349.1 million
and it was forced to slash its dividend by 95%.</LD>
<TE>   Williams shares rose 85 cents to close at $3.80 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Anticipating an increased risk that the nation's food supply may be
contaminated unintentionally, the White House will propose revised
regulations for biotech companies wanting to market new varieties of
genetically modified crops.</LD>
<LD>   But environmentalists and consumer groups said the new plan could
threaten U.S. farm exports overseas and reduce the liability of
biotech companies for their new technology.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, the Food and Drug Administration would focus
its efforts mainly on determining the toxicity and allergenicity of a
new biotech crop.</LD>
<TE>   Companies would be asked to submit scientific data sooner to the
FDA, showing the new biotech crop variety does not have an adverse
effect on the environment or consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Developers would submit the data while field testing their
product, instead of the current practice of waiting until after
testing was complete.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Still Focused on Ebbers, Experts Say</HD>
<DH>Probe: Charges against two former WorldCom execs may be a
step toward a case against the ex-CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Bernard J. Ebbers was not named in Thursday's criminal
complaints charging top WorldCom Inc. executives with cooking the
books, the former chief executive is believed to be very much in
prosecutors' sights.</LD>
<LD>   The securities fraud and conspiracy charges filed against
WorldCom's former chief financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan, and
former controller, David F. Myers, may be a critical step in the
development of a case against Ebbers, according to defense lawyers
and former federal prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clear they are trying to pressure these guys to flip," said
Gary Lincenberg, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at Bird
Marella Boxer &amp; Wolpert in Los Angeles. "It's a pressure tactic. It
suggests that there are discussions going on, but it is not yet clear
there is a deal."</LD>
<TE>   Sullivan and Myers turned themselves in to federal authorities in
New York at 7 a.m. Thursday. They later appeared before a judge but
did not enter pleas. Each faces up to 65 years in prison, although it
is highly unlikely either would serve that much time.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference announcing the charges against Sullivan and
Myers, U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the WorldCom investigation
was not over, but he declined to name targets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fair to say this is an ongoing matter, and for us to
comment further on it would be inappropriate," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   When called before congressional investigators earlier this month,
Ebbers denied any role in the scheme to hide billions of dollars in
expenses at the telecommunications company. He then invoked his 5th
Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination and refused to answer
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Through his lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, Ebbers reasserted his
innocence Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "While Mr. Ebbers had no involvement in or knowledge of the
accounting decisions at issue in this case, he always believed
Messrs. Sullivan and Myers to be competent, ethical and loyal
employees devoted to the welfare of WorldCom," Weingarten said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's actions may be good theater for the media and useful to
the politicians, but they don't prove that Sullivan and Myers ever
acted with criminal intent, an essential element we doubt the
government will ever be able to prove in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Lincenberg, a former assistant U.S. attorney, said prosecutors may
be in negotiations with lawyers for Sullivan and Myers to determine
what they know about Ebbers' role, if any, and how willing they are
to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   They may be saying, " 'We want your help in nailing down Ebbers.
These are the terms. This is the bottom line,' " Lincenberg said.
"And the defense is saying, 'No. You have to give me this or that.'
And they haven't gotten to final resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors may have believed they needed to bring charges against
Sullivan and Myers and bring them before a court to convince them the
case is serious and that the prospect of going to prison is real,
said Jean Rosenbluth, an assistant law professor at USC and a former
federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, with defendants of this type, there's a bit of a
feeling that nothing is going to happen to them," she said. "They've
been so successful in their lives, made a gazillion dollars and have
a feeling of invincibility. They don't really believe it's going to
happen. They think it's a bluff."</TE>
<TE>   J. Michael Nolan, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer in New
York, said Sullivan and Myers may already have struck a deal, at
least in principle, to cooperate in exchange for leniency at
sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm representing the CFO and controller, I'm trying to get
them in to the government to make a deal as quickly as possible,"
said Nolan, a former prosecutor in Newark, N.J. "Whoever gets to the
courthouse first gets the best deal. The second guy doesn't get as
good a deal, and the third guy they probably don't need."</TE>

<LD>General Motors Corp. led a surge in U.S. auto sales in July, as
interest-free loans and cash rebates drew customers into showrooms
despite concerns about stock market losses and America's tepid
economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   July sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.1
million, the highest since an all-time record of 21.3 million last
October. Analysts on average had forecast a rate of 17.3 million
vehicles in July.</LD>
<LD>   GM, the world's largest auto maker, said its U.S. sales of cars
and light trucks jumped 24.2% for the month, excluding its import
brand Saab. GM, riding high on a strong lineup of pickup trucks and
sport utility vehicles, accounted for about 60% of the industry's
volume increase over July 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Even Ford Motor Co., whose sales are down 9% so far this year
including its foreign brands, managed to post a monthly sales
increase for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding its import brands--Volvo, Jaguar and Land Rover--the
world's No. 2 auto maker said its July sales were up 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler saw its July sales decline 4%,
however, making it the odd man out among Detroit's Big Three auto
makers.</TE>
<TE>   GM, which has been waging a punishing industry price war,
announced July 2 that it was reviving zero-percent financing that it
used to boost consumer confidence and buying after the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and Chrysler quickly matched GM's offer and all three also
are offering rebates, as high as $7,000 in the case of Ford's Lincoln
Continental luxury sedan, to keep product moving through dealerships.</TE>
<TE>   Import auto makers are not immune to dealing in the fiercely
competitive U.S. market. Toyota Motor Corp., which said its July
sales rose 4.6%, is offering low financing rates and rebates up to
$1,300 on some models.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co. said its sales rose 7.1%, while Nissan Motor Co.
Ltd. said its sales were up 5.4%. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. which also
is offering zero percent financing, said its July U.S. sales rose
40.5%.</TE>

<HD>Disney Profit Falls on Weak Park, TV Units</HD>
<DH>Media: The quarterly outlook is somber. Also, firm takes
steps to boost corporate governance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. on Thursday said that its profit
dropped sharply in the quarter ended in June because of continued
soft ratings at the ABC network, losses from the box-office dud "Bad
Company" and a drop in attendance at Disney theme parks that is
expected to plague the company.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said the company is
taking additional steps to address investors' concerns about
corporate governance and accounting practices amid scandals at such
companies as Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Eisner promised that Disney will reduce the size of its 16-member
board of directors, criticized frequently as being too passive in
overseeing the firm. In an interview, Eisner said he has no number in
mind for board seats, but the goal is to make investors "comfortable
with the board and the independence of the board."</LD>
<TE>   Eisner also endorsed the idea of expensing the cost of stock
options in company earnings statements, something investors have
lobbied for at major firms in an effort to get a more honest picture
of company profit. This week, General Electric Co. said it would
expense options, after a similar move two weeks ago by Coca-Cola Co.</TE>
<TE>   But Burbank-based Disney stopped short of adopting the policy.
Eisner said the company wants the accounting industry's rule
makers--the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the
International Accounting Standards Board--to first provide
consistent, unambiguous regulations that all companies follow. Disney
Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs added that the company will
provide quarterly more detail on how stock options affect earnings
than other companies do.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick McGurn, vice president of investor consulting firm
Institutional Shareholder Services, called Disney's hesitation to
immediately adopt the policy tepid when compared with GE's more
aggressive action.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty Mickey Mouse move," McGurn said. "It doesn't give
shareholders a great deal of confidence that Disney is blazing a
trail in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's position on the issue is closely watched because it was
one of the earliest and most aggressive entertainment companies to
use stock options extensively to reward top executives, starting in
1984 when Eisner was hired to turn around the company.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Eisner agreed to a relatively low Disney salary of
$750,000 that held until it was raised to $1 million two years ago,
gambling that he would get rich off options. It paid off, with
Eisner's net worth estimated last year by Forbes at $720 million. In
1997, Eisner reaped $570 million from Disney stock options in one
day.</TE>
<TE>   For its third quarter, ended June 30, Disney reported that net
income fell 31% to $364 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with
$527 million, or 25 cents per share, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The number from a year ago, however, was computed using new
accounting rules governing intangible assets. Without that
adjustment, Disney's earnings would have fallen a smaller 7.1% from a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Operating income fell 26% in the latest quarter, to $828 million.
Revenue fell 3% to $5.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The most dismal news came when Disney said that reservations have
fallen about 10% at its U.S. theme parks, which doesn't bode well for
the company's fourth-quarter results.</TE>
<TE>   "The outlook at the moment is somber. The third quarter was OK,
but the problem is the fourth-quarter outlook," Merrill Lynch media
analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said. She added that although advertising
is picking up at Disney's radio and TV stations, ABC and the theme
parks remain under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   For Disney's theme parks, quarterly operating income fell 17% to
$467 million as revenue dropped 5% to $1.8 billion. At the Media
Networks unit, which includes ABC, operating income was off 40% to
$288 million as revenue dipped 10% to $2.1 billion. At Disney's
studio, operating income plunged 66% to $22 million on a 3% drop in
revenue, to $1.4 billion. Operating income at Disney's consumer
products division fell 16% to $51 million, with revenue falling 13%
to $457 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares fell 90 cents to $16.83 on the New York Stock
Exchange before the results were announced.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Claudia Eller contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Auction House Is Going, Going, Gone From EBay</HD>
<DH>Internet: Sale of Butterfields to Bonhams for an
undisclosed price ends an experiment to broaden items beyond Beanie
Babies and Elvis memorabilia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three years after buying its way into the rarefied world of fine-art
auctions, EBay Inc. on Thursday brought down the gavel on
Butterfields Auctioneers and sold the venerable institution to
Bonhams in London.</LD>
<LD>   Bonhams, founded in 1793, is the world's third-largest auction
house, behind Sothebys and Christies. The sale price was not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The sale ends an ambitious experiment by EBay, founded in 1995, to
broaden business beyond auctions of Beanie Babies, Elvis memorabilia
and other collectibles. The online firm's purchase of Butterfields in
1999 was hailed as a landmark event for the e-commerce world that in
a few short years had built empires to eclipse companies with long
and storied histories.</LD>
<TE>   EBay paid for Butterfields, founded in 1865, with $260 million in
stock--hardly a problem for the online auctioneer at a time when its
share price was about $210. EBay shares fell $1.86 Thursday to $55.23
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Butterfields offered the nouveau riche upstart access to a far
more refined sector of the auction market.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave EBay credence in fine art and collectibles," said EBay
spokesman Kevin Pursglove. "It gave us exposure to a higher-point
marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Butterfields Chief Executive Geoff Iddison said the transaction
succeeded in bringing a new audience to EBay.</TE>
<TE>   "Now 30% of Butterfield's sales are online on EBay," said Iddison,
who negotiated the sale to Bonhams but will stay with EBay in an
undisclosed job. "Last year it was 10%, so there have definitely been
changes in that people are more accepting of buying works of art
online. It has evolved."</TE>
<TE>   But not fast enough for EBay.</TE>
<TE>   "It just didn't happen at the pace we anticipated," said
Pursglove.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter of this year, for which EBay posted a record
profit of $47.6 million, its offline auction ventures lost almost $2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Those losses represent the combined financial results of
Butterfields and EBay's other traditional auction house, Kruse
International, which deals in antique and collectible cars.</TE>
<TE>   Pursglove would not say whether Auburn, Ind.-based Kruse was on
the block.</TE>
<TE>   EBay's venture into the bricks-and-mortar world saddled it with a
problem that had crippled many e-commerce businesses--inventory. Its
was used to being the middleman in online auctions, and therefore
didn't have to deal with any merchandise and the expenses involved in
its storage, management and delivery.</TE>
<TE>   But bricks-and-mortar auction houses have to handle art and
antiques.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that what we really do best is manage an online
marketplace," Pursglove said.</TE>
<TE>   EBay has not abandoned its sojourns into fine art auctions.</TE>
<TE>   The online auctioneer has a deal with Sothebys to prominently
feature its auction offerings on the site.</TE>
<TE>   EBay also has moved on to far larger acquisition ventures. Last
month, the firm announced that it was taking over online payment
service PayPal in a $1.5-billion stock swap.</TE>
<TE>   Pursglove said the sale of Butterfields would have, for EBay, "on
an accounting basis a very immaterial impact on net income."</TE>

<HD>Manufacturing Growth Nearly Halts in July</HD>
<DH>Economy: Construction spending in June slumps; jobless
benefit claims edge up. Analysts say reports cast doubts on the
recovery's durability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing growth nearly ground to a halt in July, a report
said Thursday, showing the economy has cooled significantly from
earlier this year and raising concerns that the recovery could be in
jeopardy.</LD>
<LD>   Spending on new construction projects also slumped for a second
consecutive month in June to its slowest pace in nearly two years,
while first-time claims for jobless benefits edged up in the last
week, two separate government reports said.</LD>
<LD>   Taken together with news this week that the economy grew at an
anemic 1.1% pace in the second quarter, the data cast further doubt
on the durability of the recovery.</LD>
<TE>   The Institute for Supply Management said its monthly manufacturing
index fell in July to its lowest level since January, down to 50.5
from 56.2 in June. Although that was the sixth straight month of
growth, the index showed manufacturing was barely expanding, at a
level just above 50.</TE>
<TE>   The fall was much sharper than Wall Street expected and was a
major slowdown from June, which registered the fastest growth in more
than two years. Manufacturing makes up about one-sixth of the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   A punishing stock market sell-off in July had caused businesses to
slam on the brakes after a boost of confidence about growth prospects
earlier in the year, said Norbert Ore of the ISM.</TE>
<TE>   After a powerful run-off of inventories left over from boom times,
factories rapidly boosted production earlier this year to meet rising
demand. But as businesses became more conservative about the outlook
for demand, they scaled back production.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that production probably will fall further in future
months as factories curtail inventory-building, the new orders index,
which measures future demand for goods, fell more than 10 points in
July, to 50.4 from 60.8.</TE>
<TE>   With fewer goods coming off assembly lines and orders drying up,
factories also accelerated layoffs during the month, extending a
trend since mid-2000, with about 1.8 million factory workers losing
their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The ISM employment index fell in July to 45.0 from 49.7 in June,
its 22nd-straight month below 50.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, construction spending fell 2.2% in June to a seasonally
adjusted rate of $820.8 billion, the Commerce Department said. That
followed a revised 2% decline in May spending, which originally had
been reported as a smaller 0.7% drop.</TE>
<TE>   That was the slowest spending rate since August 2000 and was off
3.7% compared with June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The sharp drop in June construction spending, which was much
deeper than expected, raised concerns that the already-sluggish 1.1%
second-quarter gross domestic product growth could be revised
downward.</TE>
<TE>   Construction spending on new commercial buildings fell 3.4% to a
$165.4-billion annual rate--its slowest pace since September
1996--reflecting weak demand among firms for new properties.
Residential demand, buoyed by low mortgage rates, held up better,
dropping only 0.9% in June.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, first-time claims for jobless insurance--an early
reading on the resilience of the labor market--rose by 20,000 to
387,000 in the July 27 week from 367,000 in the previous week, the
Labor Department said.</TE>
<TE>   The four-week moving average rose to 386,000 in the week ended
July 27, up from 385,750 the previous week, but below the 397,000
reported for the same period a year ago when the country was in the
midst of the 2001 recession.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E's Earnings Off 71% in Quarter</HD>
<DH>Energy: The firm cites problems at its trading and power
plant unit, including a credit downgrade to 'junk' status. Shares
fall 30%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp. said Thursday that its once-shining subsidiary that builds
power plants and trades energy is losing money, resulting in a 71%
plunge in net income for the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E's stock price fell nearly 30%, or $4.14 a share, to close at
$9.76 on the New York Stock Exchange on news of the lower earnings
and a credit downgrade to "junk" late Wednesday of the troubled
subsidiary, National Energy Group, by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based PG&amp;E said its utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co., is operating profitably in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The utility,
which provides power to much of Northern and Central California, is
not expected to suffer immediate problems as a result of the parent
company's earnings performance.</LD>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Corp. reported second-quarter net income of $218 million, or
59 cents a share, compared with $750 million, or $2.07, a year
earlier. Several charges contributed to the earnings reduction,
including a $159-million write-down of turbines and power plant
projects by National Energy Group, which is slashing its plant
building program. Revenue rose to $5.8 billion from $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E said it faced $1.6 billion in new collateral demands from
creditors because of the two-notch downgrade of National Energy Group
to BB+, and it could face an additional $1 billion in collateral
requirements if Moody's Investors Service Inc. also downgraded the
unit's credit rating to junk status.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of the parent firm said in a conference call with
analysts that the company had enough cash and credit if it had to pay
the $1.6 billion but would need to renegotiate its credit agreements
if Moody's were to issue a downgrade.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert D. Glynn Jr. said
the company was confident it would be able to reach agreement with
its lenders on additional security requirements for loans triggered
by the downgrades.</TE>
<TE>   "NEG and others in the sector are facing difficult wholesale power
conditions," Glynn said. "The credit rating situation is a challenge.
We have prepared a contingency plan for the downgrade, and we are
implementing that plan."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's shares fell in part because investors are worried that the
company might have difficulty negotiating with creditors, said Paul
Fremont, an analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co. who has a "hold" rating on
the stock. PG&amp;E executives "are optimistic, but they're not in the
driver's seat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Calpine Corp., an independent power plant builder and
trader based in San Jose, posted a nearly 33% decline in net income
because of sharply lower power and natural gas prices in the last
year and the collapse of the wholesale energy market after the fall
of Enron Corp. in December. Calpine's stock fell 77 cents, or more
than 15%, to close at $4.20 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine said second-quarter net income dropped to $72.5 million,
or 19 cents a share, from $107.7 million, or 32 cents, in the
year-earlier period. In the first quarter, Calpine lost $74.3
million.</TE>
<TE>   Second-quarter revenue rose 20% to $16.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's National Energy Group has suffered from the same market
problems as Calpine, and it reported an operating loss of $21
million, or 6 cents a share, compared with earnings from operations
of $71 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in April 2001, contributed second-quarter operating income
of $201 million, or 54 cents a share, compared with $175 million, or
48 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The parent corporation's woes began in 2000 when power prices
soared beyond what its largest subsidiary, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,
could charge customers in rates. In the last year, power prices have
dropped significantly and the utility is collecting much more from
its customers than it needs. That so-called headroom totaled $366
million in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   When operating income for the quarter is measured with headroom
included, PG&amp;E Corp. had a healthier quarter, earning $552 million,
or $1.49 a share, compared with $393 million, or $1.08, in the
year-earlier quarter. Headroom, which reflects power costs that were
written off during the energy crisis, is not included in net income
because of remaining uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy case.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E lowered its predictions of how much it expects to earn this
year to $2.25 to $2.35 a share, excluding headroom, from previous
estimates of $2.50 to $2.55.</TE>

<HD>FERC Says Enron Exploited Loopholes</HD>
<DH>Energy: Commission cites company's tactics as it proposes
rules for operation of regional power markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Enron Corp. strategies for exploiting the California electricity
market relied on using false information to manipulate prices, while
nine others simply took advantage of loopholes in state rules for
operating the market, according to federal regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The two strategies--nicknamed "Get Shorty" and "Fat Boy"--are of
particular interest to investigators from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and other agencies, who are trying to determine
if federal laws or regulations were broken.</LD>
<LD>   A FERC document said the two schemes involved supplying false
information about the demand for electricity and the location of
generators.</LD>
<TE>   The commission cited the tactics in documents released Wednesday
proposing nationwide rules for the operation of regional power
markets.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations, which include a $1,000 per megawatt hour
price cap, would close the loopholes that the Enron strategies sought
to exploit, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "A few of the strategies in the Enron memoranda appear to depend
on the marketer providing false information" to the California
Independent System Operator, which controls the transmission grid
covering three-quarters of the state, the document said.</TE>
<TE>   "These strategies rely on evading or violating the market rules
rather than on market design flaws."</TE>
<TE>   Nine other strategies detailed in the December 2000 memos,
including "Death Star" and "Ricochet," took advantage of loopholes in
the design of California's market, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry officials have blamed the crisis on flawed market
rules and a lack of supply rather than wrongdoing by traders.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Enron, which filed for bankruptcy in December, learned
of the internal documents in April and turned them over to the
federal commission in May.</TE>
<TE>   One of the lawyers said at the time he didn't know whether the
strategies were accurately described in the documents, or if they had
ever been used.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to cooperate in the various investigations," Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The traders involved were hired by UBS Warburg when the investment
bank took over the company's trading arm this year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To speak directly to any of these supposed strategies is
difficult for us because the people who were involved no longer work
for the company," he said.</TE>

<HD>Trading Site to Be Built Away From Wall Street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange said Thursday that it will move ahead
with plans for a second trading floor away from Wall Street, where
trading could continue if the current site had to close.</LD>
<LD>   The NYSE shut down for four days last year in the aftermath of the
terrorist attacks. It was the longest closure since 1933.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Richard Grasso told reporters the exchange is looking to
house half its operations away from lower Manhattan but within the
state of New York. The NYSE has been located in lower Manhattan for
210 years.</LD>
<TE>   Grasso said the NYSE would probably have more details on the
timing and location of its second trading floor at the next board
meeting, in October. He did not give an estimated cost of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Though the exchange has backup facilities that can be up and
running in 24 hours, it does not have the ability to trade
uninterrupted if there is another emergency in lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants the second NYSE site to be
within one of the city's five boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   But Bloomberg this summer rescinded a $1-billion tax break package
his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had given the NYSE as incentive
to construct a new building across the street from its current site.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg said the city, facing a large budget deficit as the
economy has struggled, no longer could afford the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Grasso said the NYSE may delay the start of trading
Sept. 11 so that members of the exchange can participate in memorials
commemorating the anniversary of the World Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. markets, including Nasdaq, will coordinate on any trading
delay, Grasso said.</TE>

<HD>One Strike and Fox Could Be Out</HD>
<DH>Network faces major-league headaches if players walk</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox Broadcasting Co. executives could get trapped in a squeeze play
if Major League Baseball players go on strike this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Fox uses the playoffs and the World Series as a monthlong
billboard to hype the network's slate of new fall shows. Even though
Fox ultimately loses money on baseball, postseason play has delivered
some of the network's highest ratings and, along with professional
football, helped thrust Fox into TV's big leagues.</LD>
<LD>   "With baseball comes a unique set of opportunities and a unique
set of challenges," said Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Television
Entertainment Group.</LD>
<TE>   Last season, Fox's broadcasts of the World Series drew an average
of 24.5 million viewers--more than twice the audience of Fox's most
popular programs. Fox took advantage of the platform to reach male
viewers, particularly younger men who are more likely to tune in to
"The Simpsons" or "24." The network jammed the airwaves with
promotions and teasers for its shows. Fox even turned the backstop
behind home plate into a computer-generated billboard, superimposing
images of network icons such as "Ally McBeal."</TE>
<TE>   Not only does baseball help Fox draw millions of October viewers
who otherwise might watch "Frasier" on NBC or "Everybody Loves
Raymond" on CBS, it also allows the network to reserve its arsenal of
new shows for the all-important November sweeps when station ratings
are measured. The sport also helps the network postpone the
introduction of midseason shows to replace those that falter right
out of the gate.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is like 'program-helper,' " Grushow said.</TE>
<TE>   But there are programming downsides. Baseball forces the network
to roll out its fall lineup in hiccups. Fox introduces a few new
episodes during the final weeks of September to stay competitive with
NBC, CBS and ABC but must shelve those series and hold off the rest
of its new shows until the World Series ends in late October or early
November. By that time, many viewers have warmed to new shows on
other networks.</TE>
<TE>   Fox executives say they're not expecting the current labor
negotiations to end in a strike, but the network isn't taking any
chances. Executives have been working on contingency plans for more
than a month, but they won't divulge details.</TE>
<TE>   "It starts with a personal visit to [Major League Baseball
Commissioner] Bud Selig's house," Grushow joked.</TE>
<TE>   But privately, Fox executives worry that baseball's labor troubles
have the potential to cancel or delay the World Series, prompting a
repeat of the problems the network faced last year.</TE>
<TE>   Executives attribute the network's lackluster ratings to the delay
of the World Series after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The
baseball season stretched into October and the World Series wrapped
up in November. That left Fox struggling to find momentum for its new
shows during the critical November sweeps, when competition among
networks is the most intense.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty also is causing jitters because Fox is buying
advertisements on cable TV, radio, billboards and magazines for shows
that might end up debuting sooner--or later--than planned. In the
event of a work stoppage, Fox would be forced to shuffle its ad buys
or purchase new ads at higher spot prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that we may not know until September is difficult,"
Grushow said.</TE>
<TE>   Some question whether the benefits of baseball are worth the
hassles.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fox executives believe that baseball provides a powerful
promotional platform, that doesn't always translate into higher
ratings for the network's regular-season programs. Postseason
baseball ratings increased 26% last year while ratings for the
network fell 4% over the course of the season, according to Leland
Westerfield, a media analyst with UBS Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is a franchise for Fox, but it's not one that is
profitable," Westerfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox negotiated its deal with Major League Baseball in 2000, during
a supercharged ad market fueled by heavy political spending on the
presidential and congressional races. It beat out NBC and ABC by
agreeing to pay $2.5 billion over six years for broadcast rights. The
contract gives Fox exclusive rights to broadcast the Saturday
afternoon national "Game of the Week" from June through September,
and all postseason games.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was reached before the advertising market weakened,
stalling anticipated rate increases.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the network's parent company, News Corp., disclosed it
probably would lose $225 million on baseball through 2006, when its
contract with Major League Baseball expires. That amount did not
include any financial ramifications of a players' strike.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is losing money on all its marquee sports deals, including
more than $387 million for professional football and nearly $300
million for NASCAR auto racing.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has protections built into its Major League Baseball contract
to cover a work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   The deal allows Fox to get credit for fees it already has paid for
games that are not played, credit for out-of-pocket expenses and
credit for lost profit.</TE>
<TE>   Fox could recoup as much as $300 million for games not played this
year and out-of-pocket expenses, such as studio and production
equipment amortization, a source familiar with the deal said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Fox could receive as much as $230 million in
subsequent years if a strike prompted fans to turn away from
baseball, impairing Fox's future ratings or ability to achieve
advertising revenue goals. An arbitrator would have to decide how
much Fox could recoup from the league.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Fox might lose less money on baseball if the postseason
were canceled. That would save Fox production costs, and the company
would get a credit from the league of about $257 million for games
not played.</TE>
<TE>   Fox executives would not say whether a strike would benefit the
company financially, but Anthony J. Vinciquerra, president and chief
executive of Fox Networks Group, made the company's position clear:
"We do not want a strike."</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, more viewers are watching baseball on Fox.
Ratings are up nearly 10% for the "Game of the Week," with nearly 3.7
million viewers tuned in to the Saturday games, according to Nielsen
Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   The postseason could generate as much as $300 million in ad
revenue for Fox, analysts say. The network has sold 50% to 70% of the
available commercial time for this year's playoffs and World Series,
Fox ad executives said. But sales have slowed.</TE>
<TE>   "While these rain clouds are hanging over us, advertisers are a
little hesitant to place money in the games," Vinciquerra said. And
if the postseason is canceled "we'd have to figure out what we'd do
with the advertising money already committed to baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Fox executives say they would steer baseball advertisers to the
network's football broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   But the rates and ratings are not the same because most of the
baseball playoff games are in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   And there would be no guarantee the money would stay at Fox, said
Bill Cella, chairman of Magna Global USA, which negotiates network
time on behalf of advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   "If the games go away, the advertisers will follow the ratings and
the [target audience] to other networks," Cella said. "There would be
a lot of money thrown up in the air."</TE>

<HD>CFO of Troubled Tyco to Depart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. said Thursday its chief financial officer,
the main defender of the troubled company's accounting, is leaving
the firm, a week after the appointment of a new chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco's new CEO, Edward D. Breen, said CFO Mark H. Swartz and
temporary General Counsel Irving Gutin, known for his keen
negotiating skills, would depart after successors are found.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement comes just four days after Breen, who resigned
last week as president and chief operating officer of Motorola Inc.,
started work at Tyco.</LD>
<TE>   Investors and analysts have urged Tyco to clean house amid
persistent worries over its accounting, strategic flip-flops and the
resignation of its longtime chairman, L. Dennis Kozlowski, all of
which helped Tyco's market capitalization fall $90 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Breen, in a letter to employees, pledged an "absolute" commitment
to integrity and trustworthiness. He also said Tyco had hired a
professor from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania
to implement new corporate governance practices and ensure that the
changes are instituted quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are awaiting the outcomes of three separate
investigations into allegations corporate funds were improperly used
to enrich executives.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski resigned just before a criminal indictment on charges he
conspired to avoid paying sales taxes on artwork purchases. Gutin
stepped in as general counsel when Mark Belnick was dismissed from
the Pembroke, Bermuda-based company.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz, named CFO in 1995, has been on the hot seat of late as he
was quizzed about Tyco's accounting during lengthy conference calls
with investors and analysts. He was a key advisor in Kozlowski's
decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's
largest manufacturing conglomerates. Tyco's accounting has drawn fire
as opaque and misleading, and some investors worried it was used to
artificially boost earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC investigated Tyco in 1999, but took no action.</TE>
<TE>   Perceptions of Tyco's accounting suffered another setback last
month when Goldman Sachs, a key financial advisor to the company,
said it would no longer offer an investment opinion on Tyco, citing
"heightened concern" about the SEC renewing an investigation into
Tyco's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's shares closed up 1 cent at $12.81 on the New York Stock
Exchange. In after-hours trading following the announcement, the
shares fell 5.4% on Instinet.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Approves New Governance Rules</HD>
<DH>Reforms: The changes, which require SEC approval, include
provisions to give shareholders a greater voice in stock options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange's board Thursday endorsed a sweeping
package of proposed rule changes that would require shareholder
approval of stock option plans and other measures overhauling
corporate governance at companies listed on the nation's largest
stock exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The rules, which must be approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, originally were proposed in June after a string of
corporate accounting and ethical scandals at companies such as Global
Crossing Ltd. and Enron Corp. that demoralized investors and sent
stocks sliding. The SEC had asked U.S. stock markets to come up with
ways to reform the system and restore shareholder confidence. Last
week, the Nasdaq Stock Market approved similar measures.</LD>
<LD>   The changes approved by the NYSE board Thursday include the most
controversial proposal--a requirement that shareholders approve
corporate stock option plans, although exceptions will still be
allowed for "inducement options" given to new executives, option
plans at companies acquired through merger, employee stock ownership
programs and certain tax-qualified plans, such as a 401(k).</LD>
<TE>   The changes also increase the authority and role of independent
directors, tighten the definition of independence and require regular
meetings of non-management directors.</TE>
<TE>   The board's decision to approve the changes came shortly after two
former senior officials of WorldCom Inc. were arrested and charged
with securities fraud for their role in the now bankrupt
telecommunications company's $3.85-billion accounting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "If you rob the shareholders, you should go to jail," said Richard
Grasso, chairman of the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was entirely pleased with the result of the NYSE's
labors.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very obviously supportive of the proposed set of
[rules] and we think they've been long overdue," Ann Yerger, director
of research at the Council of Institutional Investors, an
organization of corporate pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   But Yerger said she was disappointed that shareholders would not
vote on one-time stock option grants for newly hired executives.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a step back," she said. "I'm afraid that this is going to
encourage more and more companies toward even more ridiculous grants
to executives."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group made up of
large U.S. corporations, slammed the proposal that shareholders
approve all stock option plans, saying it was too costly. But the
group backed down from its opposition as the stock market continued
to plunge as the litany of corporate scandals made investors question
the integrity of U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that the reforms were more important than the concerns,"
said John Dillon, chairman of the Business Roundtable and chairman of
International Paper Co.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the SEC, the new rules will apply to the roughly
2,300 U.S. companies that are listed on the Big Board. Companies will
have two years to make sure their boards include a majority of
independent directors.</TE>
<TE>   For listed companies that do not comply with the new corporate
governance rules, the NYSE will issue a public letter of reprimand.</TE>

<HD>Shell, Exxon Mobil Earnings Tumble as Slump in Refining
Business Continues</HD>
<DH>Energy: The results are evidence of how much stumbling
economies have hurt the industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch/Shell reported sharply lower
quarterly earnings Thursday, stung by the depressed business of
producing gasoline, heating oil and other fuels.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies, although based on different continents, produce,
refine and sell oil around the world, and their second-quarter
results make clear just how much the oil industry has been hurt by
stumbling economies in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   For the quarter, Exxon Mobil's profit fell 41% and Shell's
declined 38%.</LD>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil, the world's No. 1 publicly traded oil company, saw
its stock price fall almost 8.5% after it reported net income of
$2.64 billion, or 39 cents a share, falling short of analysts'
average estimate by a hefty 7 cents a share. The shares closed at
$33.65, down $3.11, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Shell shares also tumbled, dropping 7% in London after it too
reported profit below the expectations of most analysts. Shell, the
world's No. 3 publicly traded oil company, said net earnings fell to
$2.20 billion, adjusted to reflect current oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   The earnings reports, which followed declines posted this week by
London's BP and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco Corp., sent stock
prices of most top oil companies lower Thursday. The Standard &amp;
Poor's index of major oil companies fell 7.44%.</TE>
<TE>   Shell Chairman Phil Watts described the refining business as the
"worst in living memory."</TE>
<TE>   Already under pressure from weak economies, demand for refined
fuels such as heating oil and jet fuel has been further undercut by
the lingering effects of a mild winter in the United States and the
slowdown in air travel that followed the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Strong crude prices have made matters only worse, squeezing the
profit margin between unrefined crude and the petroleum products
produced from it.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices were down slightly from a year earlier in the second
quarter, but at an average of $26 a barrel they were still well above
historical standards thanks to a built-in "war premium."</TE>
<TE>   The "war premium" came amid President Bush's war on terrorism and
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Additional strength was found in
tough supply curbs by the OPEC producer cartel.</TE>
<TE>   Even as oil prices found support, natural gas prices saw a big
drop from a year ago and undercut profits from the exploration and
production divisions at Shell and Exxon Mobil. Over the course of the
second quarter, U.S. natural gas prices were down by an average of
22% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   At Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil, which saw its exploration and
production earnings fall about 25%, it was the fourth consecutive
quarter of lower overall year-on-year earnings, after a string of
record-breaking results.</TE>
<TE>   "The earnings power of this corporation in this environment is
clearly not as strong as we thought," said Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp;
Co. analyst Michael Young.</TE>
<TE>   That could be bad news for investors. The company's stock has
fallen in recent months but has avoided the devastation that has hit
some other blue-chip U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 12 months, Exxon Mobil shares have outperformed
those of Shell, which has been hit by its recent removal from the S&amp;P
500 index and concerns about its prospects for raising production.</TE>
<TE>   Lex Werkheim, asset manager at Eureffect brokerage in Amsterdam,
said of Shell's results, "The company is very dependent upon crude
oil prices, refinery margins and the U.S. dollar, and all three
worked against them in the second quarter."</TE>

<HD>Stanley Works Drops Move to Bermuda</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Tool maker's decision could put pressure on other
firms that are considering offshore relocation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Works, one of several major companies facing a public
firestorm over plans to move its headquarters to Bermuda to save on
taxes, announced late Thursday that it was withdrawing the proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The decision could put pressure on other firms that have moved
their headquarters offshore, or are considering doing so, to
reincorporate in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   New Britain, Conn.-based Stanley Works, a major tool maker,
reiterated Thursday that the idea of moving its headquarters was
fueled by competitive concerns: The company said key foreign rivals
"are advantaged by significantly lower income tax rates."</LD>
<TE>   "Our ability to compete is being undermined by the U.S. tax code,
which is archaic in today's global market, putting U.S. companies
that compete globally in an untenable position," Stanley Works Chief
Executive John Irani said.</TE>
<TE>   But the company said it now believes that Congress "has started
down a path to deliver comprehensive tax reform that would eliminate
the inequities of U.S. international taxation and thereby accomplish
Stanley's original and continuing goal."</TE>
<TE>   Public and congressional outrage over decisions by Stanley and
other firms to incorporate in Bermuda boiled over in June, when Tyco
International's former CEO, L. Dennis Kozlowski, was indicted for
sales tax evasion in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco was one of the first companies to make the move to Bermuda in
the late-1990s, in an effort to cut its U.S. tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley and other firms were denounced in congressional hearings.
Their patriotism was called into question: Critics said they were
deserting America at a time when the country needed greater tax
revenue to fight the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Some state officials also began campaigns against the companies.
Last month California Treasurer Phil Angelides called on the state's
two largest pension funds to stop investing in companies that move
their headquarters offshore to avoid paying taxes, and said the state
would blacklist those firms.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Thursday, Stanley Works noted that two of its key
domestic competitors, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Cooper Industries,
already have reincorporated in Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Works said it's now up to Congress to change the tax code
to improve U.S. companies' competitive positions. "Ignoring this
problem will not make it go away, but can only accelerate the trend
of fewer U.S.-headquartered companies," the firm said.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Semiconductor Corp., a maker of chips for cell phones,
flat-panel displays and other electronics devices, warned that fiscal
first-quarter revenue will be unchanged from the fourth quarter
because of a weak personal computer market.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based National Semiconductor recorded revenue
of $419.5 million in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast
revenue of $441.4 million for the first quarter ending in August,
according to tracking firm Thomson First Call. National Semi posted
revenue of $339.3 million in the year-ago first quarter.</LD>
<LD>   When National Semi reported fourth-quarter results June 6, it said
it expected revenue to rise 6% to 8% from fourth-quarter levels.
National Semi said order rates were lower than expected in June,
particularly for PC and related peripherals such as computer monitors
and flat-panel displays.</LD>
<TE>   National Semi fell 98 cents, or 5.4%, to $17.13 on the New York
Stock Exchange before the revenue warning. After the close, shares
slipped to $16.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Cuts Ericsson Debt Rating to Junk Status</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ericsson's debt was cut to "junk" status by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
but the Swedish telecommunications equipment giant's shares edged
higher, bucking a broad market sell-off, because a danger to its
critical $3.13-billion rights offering subsided.</LD>
<LD>   The one-notch downgrade appeared for now to eliminate the risk
that a deeper cut might force the world's biggest wireless network
maker to delay or cancel the offering. Ericsson needs cash to run its
wireless equipment business and cut jobs.</LD>
<LD>   While S&amp;P warned that another long-term credit downgrade is
possible, it said it would wait until after what it termed Ericsson's
"critical" rights offering, set for September.</LD>

<HD>Increasing Number of Firms Hike Dividends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More companies may be getting religion about the appeal of cash
dividend payments to shareholders amid the worst decline in stock
prices in a generation.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's said Thursday that 131 companies raised their
cash dividend payments in July, up from 100 a year earlier and up
from 87 in June.</LD>
<LD>   The year-over-year change in the number of companies boosting
dividends was one of the largest in the last few years.</LD>
<TE>   The trend since 1999 had been for companies to be stingier with
dividends, as corporate profits declined. The number of dividend
increases fell from 1,701 in 1999 to 1,496 in 2000 and 1,326 in 2001,
S&amp;P data show. But in the first seven months of this year 878 firms
raised dividend payments, up from 864 in the same period of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the number of companies cutting or omitting
dividends fell to 85 in the first seven months, down from 109 in the
2001 period, S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms may be opting to share more of their profit directly
with stockholders, via dividends, as earnings rebound. Second-quarter
earnings for the S&amp;P 500 list of companies are expected to show the
first year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Other firms may be trying to reward shareholders who've suffered
through the plunge in stock prices over the last 28 months.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that raised quarterly dividends in July included
Irvine-based Fidelity National Financial, which raised its payment
from 10 cents a share to 12 cents; chemical firm Rohm &amp; Haas, which
raises its payment from 20 cents to 21 cents; and drug giant Merck,
which boosted its dividend from 35 cents to 36 cents.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Moves to Fill Oversight Board Seats</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday began the
formal process of filling the new accounting industry oversight
board. The SEC said it is looking for "persons of the highest
integrity" to serve on the board, which was created by the landmark
corporate reform bill signed Tuesday by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The law directs the SEC to appoint the board's five members within
90 days, and requires them to serve full-time. Two of the five must
be certified public accountants. The agency, in its release, didn't
list what compensation will be for board members.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC asks for submission of names by Sept. 2 to Bert Merher,
Office of the Chief Accountant, 450 5th Street NW, Washington, D.C.
20549.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Chairman David Komansky, speaking at a
business round table Thursday, said the brokerage eventually will
expense stock options awarded to its executives, but that the firm
continues to study the issue. Pressure is growing on corporate
America to deduct the cost of options from earnings.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Disputes Report of Attack in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Afghan officials said Thursday that a U.S. helicopter attacked a
village 75 miles south of Kabul, killing a civilian and wounding two
others, but the U.S. military denied the report.</LD>
<LD>   Abdul Matin Hassankhail, commander of Afghan forces in Zormat,
just south of Gardez, said a U.S. helicopter hit the nearby village
of Khomi Baghicha with a bomb or a rocket. Faiz Mohammed, secretary
to Paktia province Gov. Raz Mohammed Dalili, said an unidentified man
was killed and two others were slightly hurt.</LD>
<LD>   The secretary said the attack was prompted by "a wrong report to
the Americans." He suggested that someone involved in a feud had
falsely reported that Taliban or Al Qaeda forces were in the area, in
order to draw American fire.</LD>
<TE>   But at Bagram air base north of Kabul, the capital, headquarters
of U.S.-led coalition forces, military spokeswoman Christa D'Andrea
denied that such an incident occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no bombing; there have been none injured or killed,"
she said. "The information is incorrect."</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, Lt. Col. Dave Lapan said there were no U.S.
helicopters in the air at the time of the reported attack.</TE>

<HD>Rivals in Bolivia Forge Alliance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW ENEVER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LA PAZ, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>After weeks of political uncertainty and back-room negotiating,
former Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has forged an
odd-couple alliance that will enable him to once again lead this
troubled Andean nation.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez de Lozada, the conservative leader known locally as Goni,
and Jaime Paz Zamora, the leftist fourth-place finisher in June's
inconclusive elections, put aside their long-running animosity to
unite in what almost certainly will become Bolivia's next government.</LD>
<LD>   But the maneuvering between the two former leaders to make a deal
and the popular protest that many expect will greet the new
president's inauguration suggest that Bolivia will be further plagued
by a weak and divided government.</LD>
<TE>   The combined forces of Sanchez de Lozada's Nationalist
Revolutionary Movement and Paz Zamora's Movement of the Revolutionary
Left now face the challenge of implementing a program capable of
ending a four-year economic crisis, which has seen poverty,
unemployment and social conflict soar.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez de Lozada won just 22.5% of the vote in the June 30
election. Because no candidate won a majority, Congress will meet
next week to pick the president from the top two vote-getters,
Sanchez de Lozada and Evo Morales, an Aymara Indian and former coca
farmer who garnered 20.94%.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the electorate had sided with new parties proposing
radical change. Morales' Movement Toward Socialism and the New
Republican Force of former army Capt. Manfred Reyes Villa both came
within 2 percentage points of winning the election.</TE>
<TE>   "This political class has never offered solutions to Bolivia's
economic problems," said Morales, who described the leadership accord
as the union of "two ex-presidents to fight the indigenous majority."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez de Lozada served as president from 1993 to 1997 and Paz
Zamora from 1989 to 1993.</TE>
<TE>   At one point last week, Paz Zamora paid a late-night visit to
Reyes Villa, the third-place finisher, to persuade him not to join
the government and leave Sanchez de Lozada as a weak and isolated
president. Hours later, Paz Zamora was negotiating a share of power
with Sanchez de Lozada.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised, though I shouldn't have been," said Fernando
Garcia Algaranaz, a member of Reyes Villa's party. "That party has
changed its position over and over again for the sake of securing
government positions."</TE>
<TE>   The changing face of Paz Zamora's Movement of the Revolutionary
Left has been a feature of Bolivian politics since democracy was
restored in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Founded as a radical movement against the dictatorships of the
1970s and early '80s, the party has twice formed governing coalitions
with Bolivia's most famous authoritarian leader, Gen. Hugo Banzer
Suarez, who died this year.</TE>
<TE>   The party ran a nationalist campaign this year that saw Paz Zamora
promising a "Bolivia for the Bolivians" and calling Sanchez de Lozada
a traitor for his role in the country's privatization program. But
Paz Zamora has put aside those concerns in exchange for control of a
number of government ministries.</TE>
<TE>   Algaranaz said he doubts the coalition will lead to an effective
government for a population hungry for change.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizenry no longer believes in the political system," he
said. "Politics here is moving from the parliament to the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The first mobilizations against the new government will already be
underway when parliament reconvenes Tuesday. Thousands of indigenous
Bolivians are expected to launch protests next week against the
shelving of plans for a "popular assembly" that was to act as a sort
of parallel, watchdog legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Those are expected to be followed by protests by miners demanding
the re-nationalization of Bolivia's mines, coca farmers calling for
an end to U.S.-backed eradication efforts and landless peasants
campaigning for land reforms.</TE>

<KH>HEBREW UNIVERSITY BOMBING</KH>
<HD>Bush Says Push for Peace Will Continue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush expressed his furor Thursday at the Hebrew University
bombing in Jerusalem that killed seven people, including five
Americans, even as he confronted the constraints of fighting terror
in the Middle East while advancing his plan to contain Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Wednesday explosion left Bush under new pressure to respond to
the death of Americans at the hands of terrorists, but with limited
options. He reiterated his belief that Israel "must defend herself"
but that all parties in the region "must keep the vision of peace in
mind."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just as angry as Israel is right now," Bush said. "I'm
furious that innocent life is lost. However, through my fury, even
though I am mad, I still believe peace is possible."</LD>
<TE>   He cautioned that terrorism must not be allowed to "destroy the
possibility for peace."</TE>
<TE>   The president spoke before beginning a meeting with King Abdullah
II of Jordan. Seated side by side, they responded to reporters'
questions during a photo session.</TE>
<TE>   The king, a frequent visitor to the Oval Office, is among the
moderate Arab leaders urging the administration to quicken its
efforts to help in the creation of a Palestinian state. They argue
that the United States can expect no support in the Arab world for
its campaign to remove President Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq
unless it first makes real progress in resolving the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   There was no sign that Bush and the king were closing their gap on
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at all options, the use of all tools" to change the
regime in Baghdad, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The king responded: "What I found from Day 1 with the president is
he understands the bigger picture and that at the end of the day,
peace and stability for the Middle East has been at the forefront of
his mind."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, though a strong U.S. ally, also has been one of the most
outspoken Arab leaders opposing military operation against Iraq,
which his country borders.</TE>
<TE>   He has called plans for an attack "somewhat ludicrous" and has
said he would not let the U.S. military use bases in Jordan in a war
against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah's late father, King Hussein, although generally a
reliable American partner, refused to join the coalition that fought
Iraq in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Jordan relies heavily on Iraqi oil.</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday's meeting with Abdullah, Bush visited with Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who had been meeting with National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Peres said the first step in the Middle East is ending Palestinian
violence. A priority, he said, should be "a security force in the
Palestinian territory that will be able to help deal with those who
want to destroy the prospects for peace."</TE>
<TE>   In another rebuff to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, with whom he has refused to meet, Bush said, "The security
force must be designed to fight off terror, not designed to serve the
whims and interests of ... one person."</TE>
<TE>   With Abdullah in one corner of the White House and Peres, barely
an hour later, visiting in Rice's office in the executive mansion,
Bush directly confronted the political crosswinds that whip through
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the president has vowed to respond to any attack on
Americans. But the bombing at the Jerusalem university raises new
problems, just as repeated suicide attacks have left Israel searching
for appropriate targets.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the United States
had been in contact with Israel through its embassy "to develop leads
about who was responsible for this attack."</TE>
<TE>   "The only place we can prevent the catastrophe from happening is
at the birthplace, where suicide bombers are being trained,
mobilized, and that is the reason why we enter the cities" that have
been occupied by Israeli troops, Peres said to reporters after the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Defending U.S. efforts, Bush said, "We're responding all across
the globe to murders of Americans."</TE>
<TE>   He cited the U.S. military action in Afghanistan in response to
the Sept. 11 attacks. The military operations were directed at
dismantling the Al Qaeda terrorist network blamed for the hijackings.
He also cited the military assistance the United States is providing
the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said that the United States is working with Israel and
Arab allies to try to track down those responsible for the bombing at
Hebrew University.</TE>
<TE>   "I grieve for all people whose lives are taken by terrorist
activities," Bush said. "I'm particularly sad today because of
American families who cry today and weep at the loss of a loved one,
because there's some fanatic who believes that killing innocent life
is positive. It's incredibly negative."</TE>

<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Two differences distinguished the Hamas bombing at Jerusalem's Hebrew
University this week: The explosive was left in a bag and detonated
by remote control instead of by a suicide bomber, and most of the
victims were foreigners.</LD>
<LD>   A Hamas leader said Thursday that the organization was sorry that
"non-Zionists" were among the dead and wounded. Five of the seven
people killed were Americans. Had Hamas, a radical Islamic
organization that favors the destruction of Israel, deliberately
targeted American and non-Israeli victims, that would have
represented a departure from the group's stated policies.</LD>
<LD>   It seems more likely that Hebrew University was a target of
opportunity for Hamas: It was relatively easy to hit--students had
long complained of lax security--and it had extraordinarily painful
consequences for the Israeli psyche.</LD>
<TE>   Killing so many foreign nationals was, for Hamas, a byproduct.
Even though it risks the further wrath of major powers such as the
U.S., it deepens Israel's sense of isolation by casting the Jewish
state as an unsafe place.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to maintain jihad against Israel on all fronts,
including its international relations, on the cultural front, the
economic front, political, armed struggle, even the electronic
front," said Yoni Fighel, a retired army colonel who studies Hamas
for the Israeli International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas probably did not know that foreign students had just started
summer school at Hebrew University, Fighel and others said. But the
bombing instilled fear among those who would visit or move to Israel,
and further jeopardized programs of international cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   At Hebrew University, for example, enrollment in once-popular
study programs by foreign students is already way down this year, as
are tourism, cultural exchanges, even the ability of Israeli teams to
participate in international sports tournaments. Some foreign teams
refuse to play in Israel because of security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sorry for the non-Zionist victims," Hamas leader Abdulaziz
Rantisi said in an interview. "But they were in a place where they
should not have been. Everybody knows there is a war going on here
and they should not be in a war zone."</TE>
<TE>   Rantisi said the Palestinian who planted the bomb, which was
hidden in a backpack left in the middle of a crowded cafeteria at
lunchtime, "did not check people's passports." And because he fled
and apparently detonated the device by remote control, he might not
have known who was in the vicinity, only that there would be a crowd.
However, anyone with much knowledge of the university would almost
certainly have known that foreign students frequented the Frank
Sinatra Student Center.</TE>
<TE>   "He [the bomber] targeted a Zionist place and one symbol of the
aggression against our people, because this university is established
on Palestinian land," Rantisi said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas has said the attack was the first in a campaign to avenge
Israel's killing last week of the group's top military commander
along with 14 others, most of them children. In a separate statement
Thursday, the group threatened to kill 100 Israelis for every Hamas
leader who is assassinated by Israeli forces.</TE>
<TE>   Rantisi downplayed the significance of the means used Wednesday--a
planted bomb instead of a suicide attack. He said Hamas has used a
variety of methods.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis have been hit by more than 70 suicide bombings since
September 2000, many of them the work of Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that it was easier to smuggle onto campus a bomb
concealed in a bag rather than strapped to the bomber's waist.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber's escape provides an added advantage, from Hamas'
perspective. It makes it more difficult for Israel to identify the
assailant, at a time when it has decided to punish the families of
suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Ziad abu Amr, a Gazan academic who specializes in Islamic
extremism, said Hamas' military wing was eager to avenge Israel's
slaying of Salah Shehada last week in the Gaza Strip and may have
chosen its target precipitously.</TE>
<TE>   "They were pressed to do some form of retaliation, and that made
the target less calculated," he said. "It was an easy target, even if
it involves the risks of killing others--Arabs and non-Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   It also was a target of supreme symbolic importance. Israel's
oldest institution of higher learning, Hebrew University is for Jews
a crowning jewel in Zionist history that until Wednesday had remained
relatively unscathed by the bloodshed of the last 22 months.</TE>

<HD>Top U.N. Weapons Inspector Invited to Baghdad</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>In a surprise move Thursday, Iraq invited the chief U.N. weapons
inspector to Baghdad for technical talks, as a possible step toward
the resumption of inspections.</LD>
<LD>   According to a letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq said chief U.N. inspector
Hans Blix and his experts were welcome to discuss outstanding
disarmament issues "to establish a solid basis for the next stage of
monitoring and inspection activities and to move forward toward that
stage."</LD>
<LD>   Sabri said the U.N. weapons experts should come to Baghdad at "the
earliest agreed-upon time" but also stressed they should conduct a
"comprehensive review" to assess the degree of Iraqi compliance. Blix
has said he could not do this until the inspectors were on the ground
and could assess what had happened since late 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The inspectors left Iraq in December 1998 on the eve of a
U.S.-British bombing campaign to punish Baghdad for not cooperating
with the weapons experts.</TE>
<TE>   Annan has been trying to persuade the Iraqis to allow inspectors
to return, but three rounds of talks since March have failed to make
headway.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. They can be lifted only when inspectors certify that Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have been destroyed, along
with the long-range missiles that could deliver them.</TE>
<TE>   At their March meeting, Sabri gave Annan a list of 19 questions
Iraq wanted answered--some technical and some political. Blix
addressed the technical questions and Annan sent the political ones
to the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   These focused on lifting sanctions, U.S. threats against Iraq, the
"no-fly" zones in northern and southern Iraq enforced by U.S. and
British aircraft, and the creation of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council chose not to respond to Iraq's political
questions. Sabri made it clear that Iraq would never agree to
inspections without "dual commitment" by the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not accept that Iraq is deprived of its right to import one
pistol while Israel has the biggest arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction in the region, threatening peace and security of the
region and the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday's letter made no mention of any political issues.</TE>

<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The votive candles, placed to remember the dead and wounded,
flickered gently in the Thursday afternoon breeze at a spot just
outside the bombed-out Hebrew University cafeteria.</LD>
<LD>   Next to them were flowers, some of them wreaths with black bunting
draped across them. Students and dignitaries alike came to this spot
on the Mt. Scopus campus to pay their respects to the seven people
killed--five of them Americans--and 80 wounded in Wednesday's bombing
of the Frank Sinatra International Students Center cafeteria.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former student at Hebrew
University, placed a wreath on the spot on behalf of the American
people, then clasped his hands and lowered his head for a moment of
silence.</LD>
<TE>   "We have grieved with all the people of Israel as they have faced
Palestinian terrorism," Kurtzer said. "Now that five American
citizens have been killed, our grief is even deeper."</TE>
<TE>   Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it revenge
for the Israeli bombing in Gaza City last week that killed the leader
of the Islamic group's military wing and 14 others, most of them
children. The group also issued a statement Thursday saying it would
kill 100 Israelis for every one of its leaders who is assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in something of a surprise, Hamas spokesman Abdulaziz
Rantisi apologized for the deaths of any "non-Zionists." He said,
however, that they shouldn't have been at the cafeteria because he
considers the university to be occupied land and a battleground for
the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   But Kurtzer said the group had crossed the line when it attacked a
place that had become a worldwide symbol of cooperation among the
Middle East's nationalities and religions.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorist murderers--those who sent them and those whose
action and inaction contributed to this despicable act--have
descended to a new depth of depravity," he said. "They have violated
the sanctuary of a university in which Israelis, Arabs, Jews, Muslims
and Christians study together. It is not enough that Palestinians and
other Arabs have condemned this act of terrorism. It is absolutely
imperative that they work actively to stop terrorism immediately."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, a message from university President Menachem
Magidor was posted throughout the campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We must not give up," he said. "We must bite our lip and
continue. Giving up on what we are trying to create in a university
would be to succumb to terror."</TE>
<TE>   Magidor also sent a letter to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and
other ministers asking the government to increase security for all
Israeli universities to prevent further attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, police questioned several Arabs working at the
university as part of their probe. Investigators have speculated that
the bomb may have been planted with the help of someone from within
the school.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing marked a turn from the trademark suicide bomber, which
has become a grim part of the Israeli landscape in the last 21
months.</TE>
<TE>   By midday Thursday, officials had finally released the names of
all the Americans killed in the bombing, including Marla Bennett, 24,
of San Diego. She had been doing graduate work at Pardes Institute of
Jewish Studies and Hebrew University and was to have returned to
California today.</TE>
<TE>   Among the others killed was Janis Ruth Coulter, 36, an assistant
director of graduate studies for the university's Rothberg
International School in New York. She had arrived in Jerusalem the
day before the bombing, escorting a group of American students. The
director of the international school in Jerusalem, Menachem Milson,
said he spent much of Wednesday morning with her in a business
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "After the meeting she went with a colleague to have some lunch,"
Milson said. "She was a very dear person. It is a great loss to her
family and to us."</TE>
<TE>   The other dead Americans were identified as Benjamin Blutstein,
25, of Susquehanna Township, Pa.; David Gritz, 24, of Peru, Mass.,
who held French and American citizenship; and Dina Carter, 37, of
Jerusalem, who also had Israeli citizenship. No other details about
her were immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   The two slain Israelis, Lavina Shapira, 53, and David Ludovisky,
29, were to be buried Thursday in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said the bodies of the slain
Americans would be flown home late Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the bombing was also a time of reflection, as
students and faculty alike sought to evaluate what it would mean for
the future of the school and the relationships within it.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the student union, Koby Cohen, said that the
peaceful coexistence in the school was being tested and that it will
take time "to overcome this trauma."</TE>
<TE>   Yosef Amin, 26, an Arab student from northern Israel, said he
expected to be looked at differently in the wake of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "The relations after the bombing will be less pleasant, I think,"
he said. "One can take the campus as a microcosm that reflects the
Israeli society at large, where Israeli Arabs are always perceived as
potential suspects."</TE>
<TE>   Amin and others said that while relations are polite, they are
often superficial, with almost no interaction outside the classroom
and study sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Gil Peled, a 25-year-old Israeli, described the campus as a place
where "there are no confrontations or conflicts, and the dialogue is
fairly civil. But there is certainly tension beneath the surface."</TE>
<TE>   He said one of the best examples of those tensions was during the
World Cup playoffs, when Arab students rooted for every team that was
playing against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, a wall goes up and it becomes them and us," he said.
Amin, who will graduate this year, said he found both sides at fault
in what he termed "this ugly war."</TE>
<TE>   "On one hand, babies are killed in Gaza, while on the other hand
students are killed having lunch," he said. "There are simply no
rules or ethics in this war."</TE>

<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops led by 150 armored vehicles rolled into Nablus and
entered the narrow alleyways of the Old City early today, residents
said, in apparent retaliation for a bombing that killed seven people,
including five Americans, at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</LD>
<LD>   Soldiers left their tanks and armored personnel carriers and moved
into the alleys, trading gunfire with Palestinians, and at least two
Palestinians were killed, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The militant group Hamas said Wednesday's university bombing was
revenge for an Israeli attack last week in the Gaza Strip that killed
the leader of its military wing and 14 civilians, most of them
children.</LD>
<TE>   "Nablus serves as a focus of activity of terror groups, led by
Hamas and Fatah," the Israeli army said. It said soldiers conducted
searches and arrests there.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearby village of Salem, Israeli soldiers shot to death a
Hamas activist, Amjad Jubur, 28, a neighbor said.</TE>
<TE>   The incursion was the largest since Israel took over seven of the
eight main West Bank cities and towns starting June 20.</TE>
<TE>   Nablus had been under tight curfew, its residents ordered to stay
in their homes for six weeks with only a few short breaks, although
they defied the stricture for three days this week before some
Israeli troops moved back into the city center Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Room for Ethnic Roots in the Church, Pope Says</HD>
<DH>Religion: He reaches out to Mexico's natives, but some
criticize elevation of Inquisition informers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>In an appeal to indigenous Mexicans who have been leaving his church,
Pope John Paul II donned an embroidered Indian stole and honored two
controversial martyrs Thursday, calling them examples of how "one can
reach God without renouncing one's own culture."</LD>
<LD>   Then he bade goodbye to this predominantly Roman Catholic nation,
waving at an estimated 1 million admirers who cheered, played
mariachi music and tossed flowers at his popemobile on the way to
Mexico City's airport. As his plane took off for Rome, they held up
mirrors to send him flashes of reflected sunlight as a farewell gift.</LD>
<LD>   The pope capped an 11-day journey to the Americas with two days of
Masses here that evoked Mexico's pre-Hispanic civilizations in an
unusual departure from traditional Catholic ceremony. On Wednesday,
he proclaimed Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin the first indigenous
American saint.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the pope beatified two lesser-known Indians, Juan
Bautista and Jacinto de los Angeles, placing them a step from
sainthood. The honor stirred criticism from some Indian leaders
because the pair had been informers for the Spanish Inquisition,
helping stamp out indigenous forms of worship in a sometimes violent
process of Catholic conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on a tip from the two men, colonial police came to their
Zapotec village of San Francisco Cajonos in 1700 and raided a pagan
ceremony. Villagers retaliated by hacking the informers to death with
machetes, after the pair refused to renounce Catholicism.</TE>
<TE>   Colonial authorities, in turn, meted out the same punishment to
the attackers, decapitating 15 men and staking their body parts along
a roadside as a warning.</TE>
<TE>   "These two martyrs gave their lives for their faith, but at the
expense of their community," said Fausto Guadarrama, a Catholic who
is president of Mexico's Assn. of Writers in Indigenous Languages.
"It's an unpleasant story. It won't gain wide legitimacy among our
peoples."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul is trying to stem an exodus of indigenous Mexican
Catholics to Protestant religions, whose missionaries have translated
the Bible into Indian languages and are regarded by converts as more
sensitive to native cultures.</TE>
<TE>   The pope denied Thursday that the two martyrs had betrayed their
roots. They were, he said, "enlightened by Christ" to adapt their
native cultures to Catholicism without renouncing them. He defended
their informant work as "blameless."</TE>
<TE>   Their example, John Paul said, "encourages indigenous people today
to appreciate their cultures and languages and, above all, their
dignity as children of God." He added, "This dignity must be
respected by others."</TE>
<TE>   Some worshipers at Thursday's beatification Mass said they weren't
bothered by the reminder of the church's brutal intolerance, because
John Paul years ago had apologized for abuses of the Inquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened three centuries ago is different from what could
happen today," said Rolando Celaya, 27, who followed the nationally
televised Mass on a giant screen outside the Basilica of Guadalupe.
"It was a mistake to punish those who believed in other things, but,
thank God, that has changed."</TE>
<TE>   The Mass was replete with rituals reminiscent of the pagan
ceremonies that the two martyrs had denounced.</TE>
<TE>   An Indian woman brushed herbs over the pope and other clerics, a
practice originally meant to cleanse people of illness and harmful
spirits. Zapotec Indians in feathered headdresses the size of
satellite dishes whirled to the lively beat of a brass band from the
martyrs' native village in Oaxaca state.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrants read prayers in seven Indian languages, and John Paul
greeted worshipers in Zapotec. The slightly acrid incense wafting
through the basilica came from indigenous villages that produce it
from copal, a tropical tree resin.</TE>
<TE>   This was John Paul's fifth visit to Mexico, scene of his first
papal trip 23 years ago and a country that embraces him as an
adoptive father. The pope, 82, trembles from Parkinson's disease,
and, while his voice was unusually clear Thursday, many faithful said
this might turn out to be his adios to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I go, but I do not leave," John Paul said wistfully at Mass,
quoting a popular Mexican song. "Although I'm going, my heart
remains."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't go! Don't go!" the crowd in the basilica chanted back.</TE>
<TE>   The pope's spellbinding effect on Mexicans, enhanced by his
physical suffering, may have obscured his central message--that the
country must stop discriminating against its impoverished Indian
minority.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican commentators paid less attention to that message than to
the fact that President Vicente Fox greeted John Paul late Tuesday by
bowing and kissing the papal ring.</TE>
<TE>   Polls published Thursday on the front pages of two Mexican
newspapers showed that nearly two-thirds of Mexicans approved of the
reverential gesture. Mexico has a 150-year tradition of strict
church-state separation, but Fox has not shied from displaying his
Catholic faith.</TE>
<TE>   As the papal plane taxied away Thursday, Fox told a national
television audience that John Paul's visit "leaves us with a renewed
commitment to indigenous peoples ... to integrate them fully into
Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   From off camera, a reporter shouted, "Mr. President, is Mexico
still a secular state?"</TE>
<TE>   Fox did not reply.</TE>

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russian sports officials and figure skaters erupted in indignation
Thursday, accusing U.S. authorities of anti-Russian zealotry in
charging a reputed Russian mobster with trying to rig votes at the
Salt Lake City Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   "Russia and Russian sports have again been smeared," complained
Gennady Shvets, spokesman for the Russian Olympic Committee.</LD>
<LD>   In essence, Russian businessman and alleged crime boss Alimzhan
Tokhtakhunov was accused of conspiring to arrange a vote swap between
Russian and French judges: In return for the French judge's voting
for the Russian pair in the figure skating contest, the Russian judge
was supposed to vote for the French pair in the ice dancing contest.</LD>
<TE>   The allegations widened the scandal over judging during the
Olympics beyond the pairs figure skating, in which duplicate gold
medals were eventually awarded to Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze and Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. It also
cast doubt on the outcome of the ice dancing competition.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov was arrested Wednesday in Venice on conspiracy
charges. The United States is seeking his extradition, which Italian
officials said is likely to be granted quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "We carried out some wiretapping revealing that Tokhtakhunov has
directly, personally and effectively taken trouble in order to allow
some athletes to reach some specific results in the Olympic
competitions," said Col. Claudio di Gregorio, spokesman for the
regional police task force in Venice. "In short, according to our
wiretapping, medals results were already allotted at least six days
before the competitions actually took place."</TE>
<TE>   The new accusations besmirch Russia's reputation not only because
Tokhtakhunov is a Russian national, but also because they suggest he
may have tried to manipulate the Russian judge in the ice dancing
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The ice dancing winners were the French duo, Gwendal Peizerat and
Russian-born Marina Anisina, whose gold medal may now depend on the
outcome of the case. The Russian pair, Irina Lobachyova and Ilya
Averbukh, took the silver.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released by the French pair's agent, Liz DeSevo,
Peizerat said: "Marina and I skated our hearts out at the Olympic
Games and believe we were justly awarded with the gold medal.... We
were shocked by the latest news alleging the possibility of a fix. If
it turns out that someone attempted to influence the results of our
competition, that is both disturbing and sad. But these allegations
should not diminish the goals achieved by all the Olympians in Salt
Lake City."</TE>
<TE>   Averbukh, reached by telephone in Delaware where he is training
with Lobachyova, said they are not planning to contest the medals
standings.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there is no irrefutable evidence that the vote was
rigged, we will not behave like the Canadian pair," Averbukh said.
"We will not call press conferences, give interviews and keep droning
on that we must get a medal too. This would not be the right thing to
do. It would be insulting for [gold medal winner] Marina [Anisina] in
the first place.... We do not want medals that are extorted with the
help of a scandal."</TE>
<TE>   In Lausanne, Switzerland, the president of the International
Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, expressed shock at the new
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "The IOC is appalled by the revelations, which came as a total
surprise to us," he said in a statement. "While we knew from previous
investigations that the judgment in the pairs figure skating was not
correct, we are shocked to learn of the alleged involvement of
organized crime."</TE>
<TE>   Some Russian officials argued that Tokhtakhunov was too
inconsequential to have exercised such influence, others that Russian
judges and skaters are simply beyond reproach.</TE>
<TE>   "Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov is a man with an incredible imagination and
big fantasies," Shvets said. "He could have simply blurted out
without thinking that he would arrange gold medals for the Russian
pair, or that he had arranged them. But it was nothing more than a
boastful dream."</TE>
<TE>   "Our athletes have always been patriots and have always
represented their country with dignity," added Vitaly Smirnov, former
head of the Russian Olympic Committee and current vice president of
the International Olympic Committee. He said he was aware of efforts
in the past to corrupt Russian athletes, but said they had always
been rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov, a colorful gangland figure known popularly as
"Taivanchik," or "Little Taiwanese," was born in the Central Asian
republic of Uzbekistan and holds Russian and Israeli citizenship.
Although he hasn't lived in Russia for more than a decade, he is
reputed to be one of the country's three or four top mob bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhail Nazarkin, a Russian Interior Ministry expert on organized
crime, said Tokhtakhunov is a legendary card shark who has also been
implicated in contract murders, financial fraud, racketeering and
money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   "A prominent criminal don like Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov, having
reached certain heights and having acquired a certain status, usually
wants to dissociate himself to a certain extent from the world he
comes from, to sever ties with his past," Nazarkin said in a
telephone interview. "Hence a strong desire to become a patron of
arts, sports or something along these lines."</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov, who moved to France and then to Italy, made a habit
of inviting pop singers and other Russian celebrities to meet him
when they toured through Paris. "It is impossible to avoid Alik when
you come to Paris if you are an athlete or a pop star," Shvets said.
"He is always there, and he is always ready to help anyone."</TE>
<TE>   The French government at some point declined to renew his visa,
and he moved to Italy. U.S. authorities allege that in return for
securing a gold medal for the French pair, Tokhtakhunov was expecting
a French visa.</TE>
<TE>   The French judge implicated in the scandal, Marie-Reine Le Gougne,
has been suspended from judging for three years. So has her boss,
French Ice Sports Federation head Didier Gailhaguet, whom she
initially accused of pressuring her to vote for the Russians. Three
days later she changed her story, saying she had voted for the
Russians to resist pressure in favor of the Canadian pair.</TE>
<TE>   Averbukh, the silver medalist in ice dancing, said the worst thing
about the new revelations is that they could unfairly tarnish the
reputations of Russian skaters, who have not been accused of any
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   And in upcoming competitions, it could even discourage judges from
giving Russian skaters high scores.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so tired of all these scandals that have beset figure
skating over the past period of time," Averbukh said. "We are bled
white already by all this mudslinging.... For us the most important
thing is the Olympic Games. This is what we live and work for, what
we have staked our lives on."</TE>

<HD>Goodnight, Asia, You've Been Great</HD>
<DH>Summit: Secretary of State Powell caps off the annual ASEAN
security forum with a much- improved skit. No cowboy outfit this
time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei</DL>
<LD>Colin L. Powell has a lot of classy credentials: war hero, four-star
general, national security advisor for one president, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff for a second, and secretary of State for a
third.</LD>
<LD>   But in Brunei, the usually dignified diplomat added a couple of
new titles: crooner and ham.</LD>
<LD>   In the midst of an exhausting eight-nation tour of Asia, Powell
took a break Thursday night to perform--part of an annual ritual that
closes Asia's largest security meeting, the Assn. of Southeast Asian
Nations Regional Forum.</LD>
<TE>   The performance also parodied Powell's rocky road during the past
year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, at his first performance in front of colleagues from 23
countries, Powell bombed. Badly warbling a parody of Marty Robbins'
1959 hit "El Paso," a favorite country and western song from his
early days in the Army, Powell played the kerchiefed cowboy vying for
the love of a Mexican barmaid. Except that last year the setting was
Vietnam, where the summit was held, and the Mexican barmaid was
played by Japan's female foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka.</TE>
<TE>   The poor reviews, which led even his own staff to advise Powell to
keep his day job, were the gist of the skit this year, which combined
videotape from Washington with on-stage clowning and song that
parodied complaints about Powell's voice.</TE>
<TE>   In a dubbed version of his State of the Union address, President
Bush apologized to the nation for Powell's performance--and promised
he wouldn't embarrass the nation again.</TE>
<TE>   Mock demonstrations protested Powell's singing outside the State
Department. Placards implored: "Gotta song in your heart? Keep it
there!"</TE>
<TE>   In a videotaped call, Richard L. Armitage, Powell's longtime
friend and now his deputy, implored his boss, "I'm begging you--don't
sing at this year's ASEAN. Last year you set back relations 10
years."</TE>
<TE>   A mock newscast cited Washington grapevine claims that a secret
search was on to replace Powell with someone who could sing, with U2
lead singer Bono, who is chummy with Bush and several of his other
Cabinet officials, heading the list.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's wife, Alma, also got on the phone to her husband,
reminding him that their three children couldn't leave the house for
weeks from the shame of his skit. She begged him not to humiliate the
family again.</TE>
<TE>   The "reaction" was not only domestic. A dubbed tape purported to
show the Chinese National People's Congress voting to oppose any
effort by the Americans to sing at ASEAN. Similar votes were taken in
Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia, a top aide warned Powell.</TE>
<TE>   On stage, Powell insisted that he really is a song-and-dance man.
Up flashed images of ABBA, his favorite band, with Powell's head
superimposed on one of the Swedish singers. Several summers ago, he
added, he toured as an Elvis impersonator. Up popped a picture of his
head atop Elvis' body.</TE>
<TE>   And he reminded everyone that he got rave reviews for his routine
with the Bolshoi Ballet. Up popped a picture of two dancers in
leotards--with Powell and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister
Igor S. Ivanov--leaping in the air.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't enough. In a final videotaped call orchestrated by
the White House, Bush warned Powell that he was tired of hearing
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin gloat about Russia's skit from
the year before.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a proud nation," Bush declared. "I hired you to be the
best."</TE>
<TE>   Powell countered that he's been busy with the Middle East,
Afghanistan, the near-war between India and Pakistan and assorted
other crises.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, whatever," replied Bush. "Start practicing."</TE>
<TE>   Powell then turned to the crowd and crooned.</TE>
<TE>   Backed up by his staff, he sang rewritten lyrics to the tune of
"South Pacific's" "Some Enchanted Evening."</TE>
<TE>   "Some Bruneian evening, ASEAN is laughing," he began in a mellow
and much improved baritone.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite last year's mess, as strange as it seems,</TE>
<TE>   "Our secretary of State will still want to sing.</TE>
<TE>   "Who can explain it, who can tell you why,</TE>
<TE>   "Fools keep on singing, wise men never try."</TE>
<TE>   It brought down the house then, and later in a reprise for the
press traveling with him.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Returns to Theory of Iraqi Link to Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Washington is overriding FBI, CIA doubts on
meeting in Prague, official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN, PAUL RICHTER and DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite deep doubts by the CIA and FBI, the White House is now
backing claims that Sept. 11 skyjacker Mohamed Atta secretly met five
months earlier with an Iraqi agent in the Czech capital, a possible
indication that President Saddam Hussein's regime was involved in the
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, a senior Bush administration official said that
available evidence of the long-disputed meeting in Prague "holds up."
The official added, "We're going to talk more about this case."</LD>
<LD>   Hard evidence that Hussein was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks
would give strong ammunition to the administration in its efforts to
build domestic and international support for a military campaign to
topple the Iraqi leader.</LD>
<TE>   But the CIA and FBI concluded months ago that they had no hard
evidence to confirm Czech claims that the Prague meeting took place.</TE>
<TE>   A federal law enforcement official said Thursday, however, that
the FBI has been reviewing Atta's possible ties to Iraq, including
travel and phone records, with "renewed vigor" in recent weeks. He
said he didn't know whether any clear connections had now been found,
but he called the case one of the "more urgent" priorities for the
bureau.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official said Thursday that the CIA remains
"open to the possibility" of Iraqi sponsorship of the attacks but
that no hard evidence or intelligence has emerged to prove it. "There
is nothing hard," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House previously has declined to publicly back those who
insist that the alleged Prague meeting shows Iraq's hand in last
fall's attacks. The purported meeting with Atta, the apparent leader
of the hijackers, is the only allegation that has come to light
suggesting a direct tie between Hussein and Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration faces growing pressure to provide a
more-convincing rationale for a potential military campaign against
Iraq or a covert operation to topple or kill Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of Democratic and Republican members of Congress,
though largely supportive of a possible overthrow of the Iraqi
leader, have begun questioning the risks and costs of such a military
effort and its aftermath. So have key U.S. allies in Europe and the
Middle East. If the administration can build a strong case against
Iraq, analysts say, those questions and doubts are likely to vanish.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the administration has largely argued that military
action against Iraq is justified because of the danger that Hussein's
regime is secretly building nuclear, chemical or biological weapons
that could be used against the United States or its allies.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, the senior Bush administration official
acknowledged that the White House needs to expand its effort to
persuade its allies and the American public that Hussein poses an
immediate danger.</TE>
<TE>   "In our discussions with our friends around the world, I cannot
remember a single one who has not said, 'Of course, the world would
be better off without this man in power.' There are those who are
concerned about how to do it, and the consequences," said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be the first to say that we need to talk more about
this," the official added. "But when the case is clear, people will
understand in even greater detail why regime change is necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The official said Hussein poses several threats to U.S. interests.
The Iraqi leader is a "tactical threat," the U.S. official said,
because his Iraqi forces fire on U.S. and British military pilots
patrolling swaths of northern and southern Iraq under mandates set by
the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein is also "spreading terror" in the Middle East, by methods
that include offering to pay $25,000 to the families of Palestinian
suicide bombers in Israel and the occupied territories, the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He also has links to international terrorism," the official said.
"There is growing evidence that that includes organizations like Al
Qaeda. That would be a mortal threat to the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Asked for specifics, the official cited Atta's alleged meeting in
Prague. "The evidence that was out there holds up," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a news
conference that Iraq had "a relationship" with the Al Qaeda terrorist
network, but he declined to be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we're not on the ground" in Iraq, he said. "But are there
Al Qaeda in Iraq? Yes. Are there Al Qaeda in Iran? Yes. Are there Al
Qaeda in the United States? Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Reports of the meeting first emerged last October when Czech
Interior Minister Stanislav Gross announced that Atta had flown to
Prague in April 2001 and met with Ahmad Khalil Ibrahim Samir Ani, a
vice consul at the Iraqi Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Ani, thought to be an officer in Iraq's intelligence service, was
expelled from the Czech Republic on April 22, 2001, after
surveillance cameras caught him studying the downtown building that
houses America's Radio Free Europe, which has an Iraqi-language
service that broadcasts anti-Hussein programs.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, an informant for the Czech
counterintelligence service told officials that he recognized Atta's
photo in the newspaper and that Atta had met months earlier with Ani.
Czech officials have stood by that account.</TE>
<TE>   However, no tapes or photos of the visit have surfaced, and U.S.
officials said an exhaustive review failed to find any proof that he
had traveled to Prague in April 2001. Records indicate that he was in
Virginia Beach, Va., between April 8 and 11, 2001--when he was
reported to be in Prague--possibly casing U.S. Navy facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads and checked
every record we could get our hands on, from flight reservations to
car rentals to bank accounts," FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III
said in a little-noticed speech in April that publicly outlined the
extent of the investigation into Atta's movements and its results.</TE>
<TE>   In March, CIA Director George J. Tenet told a Senate committee
that it would be a mistake to dismiss Hussein as a possible sponsor
of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said that although Hussein and Osama bin Laden had clear
religious and ideological differences, they had "mutual antipathy"
toward the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and that "tactical cooperation
between them is possible."</TE>
<TE>   But since Tenet's testimony, the CIA has found "no known support
by Saddam for Al Qaeda cells," according to a U.S. intelligence
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that evidence showed Atta had "passed through"
Prague in 1999 and 2000. He said it was possible that Atta had
traveled to Prague again from the U.S. in spring 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The official added that no new evidence substantiates the Prague
meeting and that the CIA had not been asked to reevaluate the case.
The official said the agency has not found evidence to support
allegations that Bin Laden or his top lieutenants traveled to
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has given indications all year that he intends to
oust Hussein, but critics say Bush has not made a detailed case about
the risks and costs of such a venture. The debate continues to be
shaped by news leaks.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, hard questions have come both from Democratic
lawmakers and from such Republicans as Sens. Charles Hagel of
Nebraska, John McCain of Arizona and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, who
is the acting ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, chaired by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.),
opened two days of hearings Wednesday that will continue in September
and are likely to build pressure on the White House to explain its
case.</TE>
<TE>   "We must estimate soberly the human and economic cost of war plans
and postwar plans," said Lugar, who is also urging the White House to
seek a congressional vote before military action.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Ornstein, an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise
Institute think tank, said that last winter lawmakers were largely
unquestioning about a possible war, and Bush could have gotten 70% to
80% congressional approval for military action in a vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there's substantially more skepticism and pointed
questioning," Ornstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Germany and France are urging caution in any military effort.
French President Jacques Chirac said this week that the two European
countries would back a military effort only if it was mandated by the
U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have predicted that the administration would try to
bolster its public case by discussing what they believe is an Al
Qaeda-Iraq link.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're going to pull all that together," said Gary J.
Schmitt, a conservative strategist and executive director of Project
for a New American Century, a think tank.</TE>
<TE>   He said he expected the administration to argue that Hussein
should be ousted because of the alleged Al Qaeda link as well as the
threat that the regime may pose by development of weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Schmitt said he believed the Al Qaeda link would have the widest
appeal, but he added that he hoped the White House does not give it
more emphasis than the latter argument, which he considered more
compelling.</TE>

<HD>One in Six CFOs Tells of Pressure to 'Cook' Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>About one in six chief financial officers reports being pressured by
chief executives to misrepresent corporate financial results, and 5%
say they have violated accounting rules in the last five years, a new
survey found.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published in Thursday's edition of CFO magazine, comes
amid continuing worries about the integrity of companies' financial
results and follows a number of high-profile arrests, including those
Thursday of two former WorldCom Inc. executives on fraud and
conspiracy charges.</LD>
<LD>   Julia Homer, the magazine's editor in chief, said the figures were
unsurprising.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very common knowledge," she said. "Anecdotally, we've heard
quite a bit over the last few years about the pressure on companies
to make quarterly earnings estimates" published by Wall Street
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Of 141 CFOs of public companies who responded to the survey, 17%
said they had been pressured by CEOs and 5% acknowledged violating
generally accepted accounting principles once in the last five years.
Two-thirds of respondents worked at companies with more than $1
billion in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Still, 93% of CFOs denied engaging in aggressive accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   "One clear message is that not everybody responds to the
pressure," Homer said.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine said it sent out 2,000 surveys. No margin of error
for the poll was given.</TE>
<TE>   W. Michael Hoffman, executive director of the Center for Business
Ethics at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., said the findings were
consistent with those of other studies, which have shown even more
CFOs reporting such pressure from other employees--not just CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I am surprised, especially when you think about all
the pressures CEOs are under to meet the expectations of Wall
Street," he said. "I can imagine the CFO feeling the pressure from
the CEO who's saying, 'We're not going to get a 'buy' rating any
longer on Wall Street from these analysts.' "</TE>

<HD>Former Phone Execs Arrested</HD>
<DH>Business: Two central figures in the accounting scandal at
WorldCom become the latest corporate officers to be publicly detained
in a crackdown on fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS, JOSH MEYER and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing their high-publicity crackdown on corporate corruption,
federal authorities Thursday arrested two former executives of
WorldCom Inc., the phone company that last month admitted to massive
accounting irregularities and then filed the nation's largest
bankruptcy case.</LD>
<LD>   Former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan and former
Controller David F. Myers surrendered to FBI agents about 7 a.m. in
New York and later were charged with seven criminal counts of fraud,
conspiracy and submitting false statements to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   They are accused of hiding $3.8 billion in expenses in 2001 and
2002 to make WorldCom appear profitable and thus defrauding investors
of billions of dollars. At its peak in 1999, WorldCom--the nation's
second-largest long-distance company--was worth $120 billion. On
Thursday, its two classes of shares gave the company a value of $475
million.</LD>
<TE>   Sullivan and Myers, both wearing dark business suits, were
handcuffed and paraded past a phalanx of photographers for their ride
to federal court in lower Manhattan, where they appeared briefly
before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis. Sullivan, 40, was
accompanied by his lawyer, and Myers, 44, was accompanied by his
lawyer, his wife and a Mississippi priest.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the nation's top law enforcement officials sought
to assure the public that the government would rid Wall Street of
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "Corrupt corporate executives are no better than common thieves
when they betray their employees and steal from their investors,"
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said. Top officers who "cheat investors,
steal savings and squander pensions will meet the judgment they fear
and the punishment they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not take action Thursday against the phone company
or its controversial former chairman, Bernard J. Ebbers. But Ashcroft
and other law enforcement officials characterized the WorldCom
investigation as fast-moving, aggressive and ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, Justice Department
officials said several other WorldCom executives remained under
investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing and could face charges
later.</TE>
<TE>   At the Washington news conference, Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry
Thompson said Sullivan and Myers worked the numbers backward to make
WorldCom's earnings match Wall Street's expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts speculated that the government's criminal complaint
against Sullivan and Myers, which fell short of an outright
indictment, could be aimed at getting the two executives to testify
against Ebbers as part of plea agreements. The charges carry a
maximum of 65 years in prison for each executive.</TE>
<TE>   An indictment of the company could bring down the
telecommunications and networking powerhouse. It also could force the
government to cancel its contracts with WorldCom, which gets 8% of
its business from agencies including the Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Thursday, WorldCom spokesman Brad Burns said,
"We're fully cooperating with all ongoing investigations, and will
continue to do so until there is full resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers' lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said the former chairman "had
no involvement in or knowledge of the accounting decisions at issue."
Weingarten described Sullivan and Myers as "competent, ethical and
loyal employees devoted to the welfare of WorldCom."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's lawyer, Irvin B. Nathan, decried what he termed a "rush
to judgment and the political overtones of the way this was handled,"
referring to his client's having been arrested and charged in a
criminal complaint rather than indicted by a grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters on the broiling sidewalk outside the
courthouse, Nathan, noting the Ashcroft press conference in
Washington, said: "It is unfortunate that politics is intruding
itself into the criminal justice system."</TE>
<TE>   Myers' lawyer, N. Richard Janis, said his client would respond to
the charges in court, not elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief hearing, Francis released Sullivan on a $10-million
bond and Myers on a $2-million bond. Sullivan's bond was secured by a
$5-million lien on his palatial Florida home, still under
construction, and Myers' bond is backed by two properties in
Mississippi. Myers left in a cab, Sullivan in a limousine.</TE>
<TE>   No pleas were entered, but attorneys representing the executives
said both intended to plead not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests came barely a month after Clinton, Miss.-based
WorldCom announced that it had uncovered massive accounting
irregularities that disguised $3.85 billion in expenses dating back
more than a year and allowed the long-distance carrier to post a
profit when it was losing money instead.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests are the latest in a string of high-profile actions
against top executives and companies accused of misdeeds ranging from
fraudulent bookkeeping to looting their companies.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic came last week, when authorities swooped in on
77-year-old Adelphia Communications Corp. founder John J. Rigas at a
Manhattan apartment and led him in handcuffs through a throng of
cameras--the kind of "perp walk" normally reserved for drug kingpins
and notorious killers.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the Justice Department has moved against alleged
fraud and malfeasance at several other major corporations, including
ImClone Systems Inc., Republic New York Securities Corp., Rite Aid
Corp., Allfirst Bank and fallen energy trader Enron Corp. Justice
Department officials obtained an indictment against Enron's auditor,
Arthur Andersen, and a federal jury in Houston convicted Andersen of
obstruction of justice in June.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department, Ashcroft said, is continuing to
investigate a wide range of companies suspected of engaging in
fraudulent behavior, including Enron. On Thursday he issued
guidelines to prosecutors and federal agents nationwide to help them
implement the corporate reform package signed this week by President
Bush and go after corporate wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson, who heads the president's task
force on white- collar fraud, spoke in unusually harsh terms when
describing the alleged misdeeds of Sullivan and Myers.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a former lawyer defending white-collar companies in
fraud cases, said the two men committed "egregious violations" of
securities laws that concealed billions of dollars of expenses at
WorldCom and ultimately drove the company to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Together with others, who are not named in today's complaints,
[Sullivan] and [Myers] systematically flouted the rules of accounting
and lied outright to investors to perpetuate a false image that
WorldCom was succeeding," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the two executives convinced the investing public that
WorldCom was meeting stock analysts' expectations even as its revenue
had begun to fall. By early this year, he said, they began to
"concoct phony accounting entries to close the gap between that
expectation and the disappointing reality."</TE>
<TE>   One aspect of the alleged scheme, Thompson said, was that the two
men booked the cost of leasing access to telecommunications lines as
capital investments rather than expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "And because they knew that market participants were looking
intently at WorldCom's earnings, they decided to work backwards,
picking the earnings numbers that they knew the analysts expected to
see and then forcing WorldCom's financials to match those numbers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing critics who note that no arrests have been made in the
Enron case, Ashcroft, Thompson and other law enforcement officials
said that their investigations were continuing.</TE>
<TE>   "Without commenting on that particular investigation, I can tell
you some cases are more complex than others," Thompson said. "But
specifically with respect to the Enron task force, we're very pleased
with the work of those investigators and lawyers. That investigation
is not only ongoing, it's being pursued in a very aggressive manner."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft has recused himself from the Enron investigation because
he received campaign contributions from the firm. He referred
questions to Thompson.</TE>

<HD>Amber Alert Gets Public Involved in the Manhunt</HD>
<DH>Safety: System to find kidnappers appears to work, but some
say it must be started sooner.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A system to alert the public about abducted children was used
statewide for the first time Thursday, generating emergency
broadcasts and messages on 500 electronic freeway signs about the car
being driven by the kidnapper of two Antelope Valley teenagers.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours, the California Child Safety Amber Network was being
praised for helping authorities rescue the two girls from Roy
Ratliff, the suspected kidnapper who was shot dead by police.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never seen this much information put out this quickly and
broadly about a kidnapping case," said Spike Helmick, commissioner of
the California Highway Patrol. "That's what Amber is all about."</LD>
<TE>   The system piggybacks on an existing emergency alert system for
warning the public about storms, power outages and other disasters.</TE>
<TE>   At about 7 a.m. Thursday, California Department of Transportation
message boards on freeways across the state were displaying the
license plate number of the suspect's stolen Ford Bronco and a
toll-free CHP number for the public to call with information.</TE>
<TE>   The 500 digital signs, which at first said "Amber Alert," confused
some drivers unfamiliar with the program, according to dispatchers at
the CHP's Sacramento headquarters. The phrase was replaced with
"Child Abducted" later in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:30 a.m., a person who had heard an emergency broadcast
stopped a deputy to report seeing the Bronco on California 178 west
of Lake Isabella, Kern County sheriff's officials said. Two hours
later, a Caltrans employee also reported seeing the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Kern County Sheriff's deputies caught Ratliff driving on a dirt
road in the area shortly before 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, criticized the five hours it took authorities to
activate the so-called Amber system after officers confirmed the
girls' kidnapping earlier in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "The emergency alert system did not activate in a timely manner,"
said state Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster). "Five hours is a
failure of the system."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis said he didn't know
why it took so long.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll review this system," said Davis, who introduced the
voluntary law enforcement program last week. "We want it to be as
good as it possibly can be, and if there are any defects, we'll fix
them."</TE>
<TE>   News outlets had begun broadcasting reports about the missing
girls--who had been kidnapped at gunpoint--at least two hours before
they were notified through the emergency alert system.</TE>
<TE>   According to Runner and law enforcement agencies, deputies from
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department arrived at the kidnapping
scene about 2 a.m. and began notifying other police departments and
the media within 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   About 3:45 a.m., sheriff's deputies issued the first bulletin
reporting the crime on the state's emergency digital information
service Web site, which also alerted law enforcement agencies and
other subscribers through e-mails and pager messages.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies did not issue an Amber alert until 6:58 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "We did run into some glitches--it's just a matter of getting
things fine-tuned," said Sgt. Alfred Ortega of the sheriff's
communications center. "This has been a learning experience."</TE>
<TE>   The department's goal is to issue an Amber alert within 30 minutes
of confirming the crime, Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   Victim advocates said the Amber system--named after a Texas child
who was abducted and killed in 1996--can be one of the best ways to
protect kidnapping victims from harm because it blankets public
airwaves with news of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a
nonprofit advocacy group based in Alexandria, Va., estimates that 20
children in the country have been saved because of the network.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Amber alert works like it's supposed to, it should take
minutes before the word gets out to the media," said Jenni Thompson,
spokeswoman for the Polly Klaas Foundation, a Petaluma, Calif., group
that works to prevent crimes against children.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics show that many victims are killed within hours of their
abductions, advocates said. Suspects have been known to release
children after hearing an Amber alert on the radio, Thompson said.
She said California's Amber system showed its strength Thursday, even
though it remains voluntary. "We don't have any protocol," Thompson
said. "We don't have any policies or procedures. Having none of that
in place, it worked well."</TE>
<TE>   The governor has said he hopes to sign a bill by the end of summer
that would require law enforcement agencies to use the Amber system,
which is used in at least a dozen other states.</TE>
<TE>   The Amber system is similar to CARE, which has been used in Orange
County since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Modeled after the Amber system, CARE includes both the emergency
alert system and the emergency digital information system, but does
not use electronic freeway signs.</TE>
<TE>   The CARE system was first used in March 2000 when an 11-year-old
girl was abducted and taken to Mexico, said Jim Amormino, spokesman
for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   A tipster spotted the car near the Mexico border and called
police. Within three days, the girl was found safe and returned to
her mother. Police arrested a suspect in the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   The system was used again last month when Samantha Runnion, 5, was
snatched from near her Stanton home. Tips from the public led to the
arrest of a 27-year-old Lake Elsinore man suspected in her kidnapping
and killing.</TE>

<HD>Ballad of the Poor Samaritan</HD>
<DH>Some praise an illegal immigrant for returning $203,000.
Others say he's a fool. Meanwhile, he's still a dishwasher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>By HECTOR BECERRA TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a lonely evening beneath the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles,
Ascension Franco Gonzales had the kind of moment Mexican songwriters
put to music and transform into myth.</LD>
<LD>   The ballad, or corrido, would tell the now-familiar tale: How last
Aug. 27 an armored truck lurched, its back doors flipped open and out
tumbled a bag containing $203,000. And how Franco, an illegal
immigrant dishwasher, picked it up. And how he gave it back the next
morning.</LD>
<LD>   But it's doubtful the corrido could capture the vexing fallout of
that fateful decision, the knuckleball trajectory of integrity's
consequences.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody says I'm an idiot," said Franco, who is still washing
dishes at a Chinese restaurant in South Los Angeles. Well, not
everybody. His mother back in Mexico is very proud. And two Hollywood
moviemakers think he may have a tale worth telling.</TE>
<TE>   "A poor fellow finds money, and gives it back. That's a profoundly
moving story," said Paul Mazursky, writer of films like the
Oscar-winning "Harry and Tonto." "Most of the rich guys I know, they
wouldn't be giving it back."</TE>
<TE>   "It has the power of a fable--of myth," said screenwriter-novelist
David Freeman. "I mean, you would think, finding the money, just
having it, that creates troubles. But once this guy decides to give
it back, that's when the craziness begins for him."</TE>
<TE>   It was Aug. 27, about 8:40 p.m., at 7th Street and Grand Avenue,
when temptation belly-danced into his life.</TE>
<TE>   Franco, a boyish 23-year-old with a self-deprecating sense of
humor, was waiting for the bus when the $203,000 fell to the street.
There wasn't another soul around. He picked up the clear plastic bag
and, to be safe, poked through trash canisters for a dark garbage bag
to conceal the loot.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't deny I needed the money, that I thought about [keeping]
it," Franco said.</TE>
<TE>   But if he did take the money, would anyone back home really
believe he had found it? Maybe Franco would become the subject of
another kind of corrido, a narco-corrido, the kind that extols the
deeds of drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   He told his five roommates at their South-Central apartment that
if he saw anything on the news about the money, he would return it.
But that was just an excuse. He knew it would be on the news.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning Franco called the police, who asked questions
over and over. Could they tell the media? No way, he said, fearing
that publicity would lead the Immigration and Naturalization Service
to his door. They agreed to meet him near the baseball field at
nearby Gilbert Lindsey Park. He stuffed the money into his laundry
bag.</TE>
<TE>   One of the officers, Sgt. Rick Sanchez, had yet more questions. He
also asked, again, if the police could alert the media. Again, Franco
said no.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez persisted, telling Franco he could get some job offers.
Franco reluctantly relented. As Mazursky tells it--in a scene that
"made the movie for me"--Franco asked for only one thing.</TE>
<TE>   "After the cops took the money, he was looking at them, and they
said, 'What's the matter? Is there anything else?' He said, 'Can I
have my laundry bag back?'" said Mazursky, cracking up.</TE>
<TE>   Glowing newspaper stories about Franco appeared across the
country, as well as in Latin America, Asia and Europe. But he was
irritated--"I made a fool of myself"--when he agreed to wash dishes
in the background as a Spanish-language TV reporter pronounced that
Franco would "continue to be a poor dishwasher."</TE>
<TE>   When the news reached Tepeapulco, his hometown of 45,000 about 90
minutes northeast of Mexico City, strangers approached his family to
congratulate them on his honesty.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried of joy," said his mother Paula Gonzales, 47, when she saw
her son on television. "He seemed a little gordito," she added,
referring to the weight he had put on in the two years since she had
seen him. "I thought it was a miracle from God--that God illuminated
the path for him. We're very proud of our son. Honesty is something
we inculcated in him."</TE>
<TE>   Others called him un buey-- literally an ox, figuratively an
idiot.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Liberio Sergio Franco, 49, said friends as well as
strangers had told him that his son "should have come back with the
money."</TE>
<TE>   Even one of Franco's uncles, Gonzales said, called him an "idiot
for returning money God had secured for him." A close friend in Los
Angeles also lobbed zingers, giving Franco a nickname he still hears:
Nino rico. Rich boy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy for people to tell you what you should have done,"
Franco said. "It's not their life. I tell them it's so easy, huh?
They weren't in my skin."</TE>
<TE>   Raul Anorve, director of the Los Angeles-based Instituto de
Educacion Popular del Sur de California, said many day laborers and
immigrants had seen Franco's good fortune as a blessing from God,
"like the money came from heaven."</TE>
<TE>   "Some said he deserved to flee with the money," Anorve said. "Poor
immigrants do so much of the dirty work and never get the
recognition. 'Something like this comes along, and at least one of us
gets lucky, and he ought to have kept it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Franco brushes off the criticism. More galling is the suggestion
he lacks the drive to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I lacked malice that night," he said. Then, thinking
better, he said the word isn't malice; it's more a mix between that
word and cunning, perhaps ambition.</TE>
<TE>   And to suggest that Franco lacks ambition is to miss the dream
that drove him to the United States in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   When he was about 8, he began to notice how hard and long his
mother worked cleaning houses, often the houses of the town's
wealthier residents.</TE>
<TE>   "He would tell me, 'Mama, sit down a little,'" she said. "He would
say, 'When I'm big, I'm going to make you a really big house--so you
could have your own house to preoccupy yourself with and you won't
have to go to work.'"</TE>
<TE>   She had worked since she was a girl, and in farming towns like
Tepeapulco, she said, there aren't many opportunities for what might
be called prestige jobs. So people take pride in doing what needs to
get done. "You go forward," she said, "on the basis of working."</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband couldn't afford to put Franco through high
school, let alone a university. After working as a carpenter, his
father's profession, and in the garment industry, Franco sold wares
at a small store.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he came to California to raise money for his
mother's house. "She worked too much and she had worked enough
already for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The man who would be heralded for his honesty saw no contradiction
in crossing the border illegally. Conditions back home had given him
little choice, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The factories are finished," Franco said of the empresas  that
once provided jobs in Tepeapulco.</TE>
<TE>   And it seemed so easy to make money in the United States, an
impression created by the young men, or chavos, who returned from up
north. "The chavos who came from here to the town carried a lot of
cash. It's the thing that pushes you to think you can make money over
here," Franco said.</TE>
<TE>   But the illusion of easy money quickly broke down. Franco worked
hard--10 hours a day, six days a week--at a Chinese restaurant for
about $1,300 a month. He sent $600, maybe $800, a month back home. He
helped pay for the funeral of a cousin who was killed in a car wreck
near the agricultural fields of Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   On his one day off, he might eat at a mariscos, a seafood
restaurant, or join friends at los bailes--dances. But just as often,
he stayed home.</TE>
<TE>   When Mazursky and Freeman, assisted by an interpreter, took him to
the Pantry restaurant a few months ago, he looked straight ahead, as
if embarrassed by the busy scene around him.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of good-looking chicks walking in and out, but
Ascension doesn't look much to the right or to the left. He just
looks at the food," said Mazursky, who pronounced him "a nice kid."</TE>
<TE>   Franco wants to build that house, and says that clowning around
and cotorreando--flirting--with girls, would delay that goal. The
worst thing, he long thought, would be to get in trouble, to draw the
attention of the authorities. It's a fear natural to the
undocumented. He'd never even gotten a traffic ticket, and that was a
small point of pride.</TE>
<TE>   Mazursky and Freeman had entered his life in October, though they
had to wait to meet him. He was too busy working, raising money for
his mother's house. At first, Franco wasn't sure his life was movie
material, especially when Mazursky and Freeman said a movie might
have a love interest. Franco, who often jokes about the sorry state
of his social life, said: "Well, introduce me to that woman, because
in real life, I know no such person."</TE>
<TE>   The mixing of fact and fiction doesn't concern him, Franco said.
He just thinks a movie, which is still not a done deal, would just
release more gossip.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just going to talk even more," he said. "Well, what are
you going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Franco never did get a job offer. "With difficulty I found this
job," Franco said of why he hasn't found something better paying than
dishwashing. "I'm the kind of person, I won't even think of moving
out of a job unless I definitely have something else lined up."</TE>
<TE>   Although Franco trusted the police not to turn him in to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, he feared the publicity might
lead to his arrest. The coverage also unnerved his boss, who remains
anxious about the publicity.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials have said they have bigger problems to worry about
than a single undocumented immigrant who did a good deed. A rumor
spread in Tepeapulco that Franco was even given citizenship--his
papeles, papers--for his act.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's your 'papers,'" said Franco, flicking his fingers in an
irreverent signal that he had gotten no such thing.</TE>
<TE>   But the armored car company did give him a reward--$25,000. After
taxes and paying $700 to a check-cashing place--another downside to
being undocumented--he netted $17,000.</TE>
<TE>   He gave some of the money--a couple hundred dollars here, a
thousand there--to a few people who had helped him when he first came
to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Most of it he sent to Tepeapulco, where his parents raised the
shell of the house he had promised them as a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Franco still needs about $10,000 for windows, electricity and
other finishing touches. He'll keep working until he gets it, he
says. Then he'll go home.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, they criticize him," his father said. "But many also
congratulated us for having such a son. They speak to us with
respect. And those who talk bad, they see the house, and their mouth
falls."</TE>

reward to put up the shell but plans to work until he has enough to
finish it.</CP>

<HD>Teens Rescued, Abductor Killed After Massive Statewide
Search</HD>
<DH>Crime: The two girls were kidnapped at gunpoint near
Lancaster and said they were later sexually assaulted. Police chase
ends in Kern County.</DH>

<LD>A terrifying odyssey that began early Thursday on a dusty lovers'
lane in the Antelope Valley came to a bittersweet end 12 hours later
when two teenage girls were rescued from a man who had kidnapped them
at gunpoint. The kidnapper was shot to death in a dry river bed in
Kern County, ending a statewide manhunt.</LD>
<LD>   "The girls are safe," Assistant Los Angeles County Sheriff Larry
Waldie told a grateful crowd gathered at the Lancaster sheriff's
station shortly after 1 p.m. The crowd applauded seconds later when
Waldie announced, "The suspect is deceased."</LD>
<LD>   Only later did authorities say that the two girls, who are 16 and
17 years old, told investigators that the kidnapper, Roy Ratliff, had
raped them. Kern County Sheriff-Coroner Carl Sparks said he believed
Ratliff was on his way to kill the girls and bury their bodies in the
desert when he was caught on a desolate stretch of road between
Ridgecrest and Lake Isabella.</LD>
<TE>   So ended a strange and troubling episode that featured the first
use in California of a new freeway alert system designed to foil
kidnappings. "Amber alert" freeway signs flashed for hours Thursday
morning--until they were changed to "Child abducted" to end
confusion.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, that warning was followed by a description of the
vehicle being driven by the suspected kidnapper, a white 1980 Ford
Bronco.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities credited that system with leading to the first tip
about the suspect's whereabouts, and ultimately to his death.</TE>
<TE>   The double kidnapping came on the heels of tragic abductions
involving younger children in recent months, and terrified friends
and relatives of the two girls, both of whom were described as
exceptionally bright, strong and popular students at their respective
high schools.</TE>
<TE>   (The Times is not naming the girls because the paper withholds the
names of alleged victims of sexual assaults.)</TE>
<TE>   "My heart went back in my chest when I heard the girls were
alive," said the mother of the 17-year-old when the rescue was
announced.</TE>
<TE>   The girls, who were not friends, had been in two cars, each with a
boy, when they were accosted sometime after midnight at a popular
teen gathering spot on a remote hilltop overlooking the tiny town of
Quartz Hill, just west of Palmdale and Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Ratliff--a 37-year-old ex-convict who
was on the run from a rape charge--pulled up in a gray Saturn that he
had stolen at gunpoint in Las Vegas two weeks earlier. The car had a
flat tire, leading some law enforcement officials to speculate that
his primary interest was in getting another vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Brandishing a semiautomatic handgun, Ratliff approached both cars
containing the teens, ordered them out, demanded money from the boys
and tied them up with silver duct tape. He then ordered the girls
into the Bronco that had been driven by one of the boys, Eric Brown,
and drove off.</TE>
<TE>   At some point before he left, authorities said, Ratliff poured a
can of gasoline over the Saturn in an apparent attempt to destroy the
car by burning it. It did not ignite.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said Ratliff seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the
plateau known locally as Quartz Hill Mountain, which offers a
sweeping nighttime view of desert, city lights and stars.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard him get out of the car, I didn't see him get out of
the car, and he was just suddenly at my window with a gun," he told
KCAL-TV Channel 9. "He told me to give him all my money.... He said a
lot of stuff. Mostly, it sounded like he was trying to decide whether
to kill me or not."</TE>
<TE>   The other boy, Frank Melero Jr., eventually was able to wriggle
free of the duct tape and call his sister, Elizabeth Melero, who said
he told her he had been robbed. Initially, she said, he didn't
realize the girls had been kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just scared," she said. "He was actually under control,
but he didn't really know what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Melero made the call about 1:45 a.m., and his sister
followed it immediately by calling 911, authorities said. Sheriff's
deputies said they arrived at the scene of what they assumed was a
run-of-the-mill robbery at 1:58 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear how much time had elapsed before Melero tore free
of the duct tape. Some investigators estimated that the crime
occurred at 12:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery that the two girls had been kidnapped set in motion
a massive manhunt. Ultimately, at least half a dozen law enforcement
agencies in Southern California were intensively involved, and the
search drew in motorists statewide through the new California Child
Safety Amber Network, which posts kidnapping alerts on electronic
freeway signs as well as on radio and television.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:30 a.m., Kern County sheriff's officials said, someone who
had seen the alert stopped a deputy and reported seeing the suspect's
vehicle on California 178 in the Walker Pass area, about 70 miles
east of Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, a neighbor of Ratliff's called a Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputy to say he had seen Ratliff driving a Saturn
matching the description of the car found at the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Around 11:30 a.m., a Caltrans flagman working on a highway
construction site was listening to the radio and heard the Amber
alert. Moments later, he looked up and saw the Bronco pass by, a
California Highway Patrol official said. He scraped the license
number into a nearby patch of dirt and called CHP dispatch, the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officers, who were already stationed on California 178, began
working their way westward. Kern County sheriff's deputies began
searching from the east in a pincer movement that, they hoped, would
trap the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "There's very few places to get away--it's a two-lane road through
a rough and rugged area," said Kern County Sheriff's Cmdr.
Christopher Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Also taking part in the manhunt were five law enforcement
helicopters and three airplanes. Three helicopters focused on the
California 178 area as the hunt intensified.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, authorities said, a Kern County animal
control officer spotted the Bronco on White Blanket Road, a dirt road
that traverses the White Blanket Indian allotment off California 178.</TE>
<TE>   It was there, on scrub-covered Native American land, that the
standoff between the suspect and Kern County sheriff's deputies
ultimately took place.</TE>
<TE>   Two deputies, James Stratton and Larry Thatcher, were sent to the
site. Driving separate vehicles, they spotted the Bronco about 50
feet in front of them, Sheriff-Coroner Sparks said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Sparks added, the Bronco sped up, swerved off the
dirt road and then barreled down a hill where it became stranded in a
dry river bed.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies jumped out of their patrol cars. Scrambling down a
hill, they approached the Bronco. As they screamed for the driver to
get out, Ratliff hollered, "No way! no way!" Sparks said.</TE>
<TE>   Ratliff reached into the back seat and pulled out a weapon, the
sheriff said. He said Stratton fired one round into the rear of the
Bronco, shattering the back window. Soon afterward, Ratliff fled the
car.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, after firing, the deputies heard a noise coming from
the back of the vehicle and realized that the girls were still in
there.</TE>
<TE>   As Stratton scooped up the girls and led them to safety, Thatcher
came within four feet of Ratliff before firing at least two more
shots, Sparks said. The sheriff, who put the time at 12:51 p.m.,
added that he didn't know whether the kidnapper shot at the deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the girls told them they had been raped shortly
after the kidnapping. They were later taken to Kern County Medical
Center to be examined and sent home. Peter Bryan, chief executive
officer of the hospital, said the girls were in "good medical
condition, given the ordeal they have gone through."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they believed that Ratliff was driving up to
the desolate Kern County site to kill and bury them.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly believe he was driving up here looking for a place to
bury the bodies," Sparks said.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that the girls knew why he brought them up here," the
sheriff added. "He had already raped them. Why else would he bring
them up there?"</TE>
<TE>   Sparks said the girls had tape on them but were not bound when the
deputies rescued them. He said Stratton helped the girls up the hill.
The sheriff described the girls as "highly emotional."</TE>
<TE>   "They were scared, frightened and excited about being rescued at
the same time," Sparks said. "God was here today."</TE>
<TE>   A sketchy profile of Ratliff as an increasingly desperate felon
began to emerge from law enforcement records and neighbors' accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, the Kern County sheriff's commander, said Ratliff, who
lived in Rosamond, not far from Edwards Air Force Base, had been
charged with spousal abuse and rape, for which authorities had issued
a $3-million arrest warrant in October in Kern County Court.</TE>
<TE>   California Department of Corrections records also show that
Ratliff served prison time for three felonies including burglary and
drug possession. At the time of the kidnappings, he was wanted by
California authorities for absconding from parole, said corrections
spokesman Russ Heimrich.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a suspect in a July 18 carjacking in Las Vegas. A
police spokesman there, Officer Tirso Dominguez, said a man had
accosted a 64-year-old woman outside her downtown Las Vegas home.
When the woman's husband appeared, the man pointed a gun at him,
demanded and received money, and then fled in the car--the same gray
Saturn that Ratliff drove to Quartz Hill on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In Rosamond, about 40 miles from where Ratliff died, neighbors
said that he and his wife largely kept to themselves in a corner unit
of a small townhouse complex. A next-door neighbor, James Flanagan,
42, said he rarely saw Ratliff, but when he did, there was a "lot of
hatred" in his looks.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the kidnapping, Flanagan said, "I think it's crazy. I'm
sorry he got shot, but that's one less crazy person in the world we
have to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Robert Cunningham, said he had never seen
Ratliff but that a woman he took to be Ratliff's wife or girlfriend
seemed to be very friendly and would smile and wave.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who answered the phone at Ratliff's home and identified
herself as his wife said she was not ready to talk about the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't talk to you right now," the tearful woman told a
reporter. "I have to be with the kids."</TE>
<TE>   In Palmdale, Greg Donahue, a high school math teacher and coach
who is a neighbor of one of the abducted girls, spoke for many when
he said he was thrilled to hear the girls were alive but happier
still "when they said [Ratliff] was dead."</TE>
<TE>   And out at the site where the girls were rescued and their
assailant killed, Sheriff-Coroner Sparks stood a few dozen yards from
the dead man's body and said he, too, was satisfied with the way the
day ended.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to rehabilitate the son of a bitch," he said. "This
man right here is not going to appeal his case to the Supreme Court."</TE>

<HD>Report of Rapes Posed Dilemma for Media</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developing coverage Thursday of the kidnapping of two teenage girls
posed a dilemma for media outlets across the country, when reports
from the Kern County sheriff expanded the story from one of abduction
to include rape.</LD>
<LD>   That information suddenly changed the rules for many outlets,
including The Times, that have a policy against publishing the names
of sexual assault victims.</LD>
<LD>   The girls' names, ages and photographs--one in her cheerleading
uniform and the other dressed for a formal--already had appeared on
Web sites and television shows for most of the day. Their names had
been mentioned "on every top-of-the-hour broadcast in the country,"
said Ray Lopez, producer of the talk-radio program "The John &amp; Ken
Show" on KFI-AM (640).</LD>
<TE>   "The problem is that they put out their names in the media to help
find them. There's no way we could protect the names, even though
they might have been rape victims," he said.</TE>
<TE>   National Public Radio has a policy to "err on the side of not
using the names of rape victims, particularly underage rape victims,"
said Bruce Drake, vice president for news. "But this story has
developed in a way most don't develop. Their names were out there, we
were already on the air naming their names. Then the sheriff goes on
national TV and says they were raped. There is no way not to connect
the dots."</TE>
<TE>   By late Thursday night, most television networks and affiliates
said they had independent confirmation from the Sheriff's Department
that the girls had been raped, and they took down the photos and
refrained from again naming them.</TE>
<TE>   The developments got bogged down on some Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, MSNBC and KNBC-TV (Channel 4) ran updated stories on their
Web sites with the allegations of rape, but still used large photos
at 8:30 p.m., more than 90 minutes after other networks had alerted
their television and radio stations to back down.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Web site is an independent company, and usually we're right
in sync with them," said Kimberly Godwin, vice president news
director at KNBC-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Some media outlets had a more streamlined process for pulling
back. ABC News issued a "kill" bulletin three minutes after it
learned that authorities said the girls had been raped, prohibiting
any outlets and affiliates from using the names or images. CNN did
the same thing, although the network couldn't pull pre-taped shows
that would re-air overnight with photographs of the girls.</TE>
<TE>   In what can only be described as hedging its bets, once Fox News
Channel confirmed the sheriff's comment, they replaced the portraits
with "far away" video of the girls' homecoming that showed them from
the side, said spokesman Rob Zimmerman.</TE>

<HD>Simon Doesn't Remember $1.2-Million Loss</HD>
<DH>Politics: Candidate said in a deposition he could not
recall the setback despite claiming it on his taxes and writing about
the deal on a memo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the biggest losses that Bill Simon Jr. claimed on the tax
returns he signed in October was a $1.2-million hit from his failed
gamble on a pay phone company.</LD>
<LD>   Yet seven months later, deposed under oath, the Republican
gubernatorial nominee could not recall whether anyone told him he
lost the money.</LD>
<LD>   Was he happy about the loss?</LD>
<TE>   "I don't have a recollection of having a feeling of happiness or
sadness or anger or joy, because I don't remember," Simon testified
in May.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's apparent disengagement from matters with a profound impact
on his personal finances and his family's investment firm came to
light in his testimony on the pay phone deal. He said that not only
did he know virtually nothing about the pay phone investment, he also
was unsure how much of his family's firm belonged to him.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Superior Court jury this week levied $78 million in
damages against the firm, William E. Simon &amp; Sons, after finding that
it had defrauded a partner in the deal, Santa Barbara entrepreneur P.
Edward Hindelang. The case stemmed from the Simon firm's takeover of
Hindelang's Van Nuys company, Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   Simon quietly dropped off the campaign trail for two days at the
end of May for his videotaped deposition in the case. The 619-page
transcript of his testimony at a downtown Los Angeles law office
offers a rare peek into the inner workings of the Simon family's
highly secretive investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   It also provides insight--from the candidate--into his specific
role at the firm, where he worked full time for 14 years as a top
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Simon portrayed himself as being detached from the firm's
investment decisions, including the pay phone fiasco that personally
cost him more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some things you don't necessarily need to know," Simon
testified.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Simon couched much of his testimony in phrases
that left many of his answers unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was a hands-on manager, Simon replied: "Well, you
know, I guess we could talk about what you mean by 'hands-on.' But I
would look at it as not particularly hands-on, in terms of individual
investments."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has taken a leave of absence as co-chairman of the firm
to run for governor, answered hundreds of questions with variations
of "I don't recall" and "I don't honestly remember."</TE>
<TE>   He particularly displayed a striking lack of knowledge about the
details and the broad terms of the pay phone deal, in which his
family invested $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who founded William E. Simon &amp; Sons in 1988 with his
brother Peter and their father, the former U.S. Treasury secretary,
is a co-chairman of the committee that approves the firm's
investments. But he testified that he did not recall attending any
committee meeting on Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, whose average annual income is $3.3 million, also said he
recalled virtually nothing about Coinable Simon LLC, the company set
up by the Simon group to invest in Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   Yet on the federal income tax returns that Simon signed for 1999
and 2000, he listed his $1.2-million loss in Coinable Simon as one of
his largest tax deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Even when he was shown a 10-page memo on the pay phone deal
covered with his own handwriting in the margins (including "wow!"
"please explain" and "how about we make some money first"), Simon
testified that he could not recall any conversations about the memo's
contents.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the jury found that the Simon group hid from Hindelang
that it planned to borrow large sums of money to expand Pacific Coin
against his wishes, and then to take it public in a stock offering.
The jury also concluded that the Simon firm hid its plan to charge
$1.5 million in investment banking fees.</TE>
<TE>   The jury rejected a claim by the Simon investors that Hindelang
defrauded them by concealing his long-ago marijuana smuggling
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   At Simon's deposition, Hindelang's lawyers struggled to get him to
answer questions about the alleged fraud. The candidate said he could
not recall specifics.</TE>
<TE>   But when asked, in general, whether investors buying a controlling
interest in a company should disclose to its owner that they intend
to take it public and charge investment banking fees, Simon defended
his firm's conduct. "Once you sell control of your company, most
businesspeople understand that they run a risk, and the risk that
things are done without their consent," he testified. "There are some
times when we get outvoted too, and it's not pleasant. But it
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's insistence that he played no major role in decisions on
Pacific Coin does not square with the recollection of others at
William E. Simon &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon was very concerned about the future of the pay phone
industry, and that the technology was coming in quickly and would
replace pay phones," an associate at the firm, Henry Brandon III,
testified. He said Simon was "the one person I remember being vocally
against it."</TE>
<TE>   "The gist of it was 'I'm going to let this one go through, but I
am concerned about these factors,' " Brandon said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in an interview earlier this year, Simon said that his wife
opposed the investment because of the growing prevalence of cellular
phones, but that he told her "there's always going to be a need for
pay phones."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Pacific Coin, Simon's lack of knowledge extended to matters
central to the operation of his family's firm--and to distribution of
the money it makes. Anthony C. Duffy, a lawyer for Hindelang, asked
Simon whether he recalled his share of William E. Simon &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Simon replied.</TE>
<TE>   "Was it more or less than 50%?" Duffy asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it was less than 50%, but I just don't know what it
was," Simon testified.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's inability to answer basic questions about his firm poses a
significant political problem for a candidate who promotes himself as
a successful businessman. The main rationale that he offers for his
candidacy is that his management skills are stronger than those of
his Democratic opponent, Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   And the pay phone court case is not the first to raise questions
about Simon's business acumen.</TE>
<TE>   Records in another case show that when Simon was on the board of
directors of the now-defunct Western Federal Savings &amp; Loan,
regulators rebuked the board for lax supervision of management. Simon
has argued that it was not the board's duty to supervise management
despite federal rules to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   In the pay phone case, political concerns were never far from the
courtroom. For months, attorneys for Simon fought to quash
Hindelang's subpoena requiring him to testify in the pay phone case.
They called the subpoena "unreasonable, oppressive and intended to
harass."</TE>
<TE>   "Simon is the Republican candidate for the governorship of
California, and his availability is extremely limited," they wrote in
court papers.</TE>
<TE>   They also said Simon had "no direct personal knowledge of any
subjects" relevant to the court case.</TE>
<TE>   A judge refused to quash the subpoena. But Simon's lawyers--in
their effort to distance the candidate from the case--succeeded in
getting the court to delete his name from a document that went to the
jury as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   An important question now is whether there is more to Simon's
history as an investment banker that could disrupt his campaign. For
example, when he allowed reporters to look at his tax returns from
1990 to 2000 for a few hours last week, his state tax returns for
1995 were missing.</TE>
<TE>   "They are being aggressively looked for," Simon spokesman Mark
Miner said Thursday. "They were misplaced. There's nothing more to it
than that."</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign has refused to let reporters take a second look
at his tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   A host of questions raised by the one-time glimpse remain
unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the viewing, for instance, Simon's chief strategist
Sal Russo could not identify the nature of Chiles Offshore--a company
from which Simon claimed a $190,000 investment loss. Russo also could
not explain a long list of other investments disclosed in the tax
records.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days after Russo pledged to explain them, the campaign has
yet to do so.</TE>

<HD>Fraud Verdict Stuns Simon's Backers Across the Country</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fretful Republicans from California to Washington were reassessing
their commitment Thursday to the gubernatorial candidacy of Bill
Simon Jr., as the GOP hopeful struggled to contain the political
fallout from a jury's multimillion-dollar fraud verdict.</LD>
<LD>   Simon dismissed the $78-million judgment at a campaign stop in Los
Angeles, calling the decision by 12 jurors "fundamentally flawed." He
predicted it would eventually be overturned by the trial judge or an
appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   Strategists for Democratic incumbent Gray Davis redoubled their
attack on Simon, launching a new statewide television ad criticizing
his business ethics and accusing him of dodging taxes. "If we can't
trust him in business, how can we trust him in the governor's
office?" the spot asked.</LD>
<TE>   More significant was the silence emanating from the White House
and national Republican Party leaders, who would normally spring to
the defense of their California standard-bearer.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line question is [whether] everyone is walking out
now," said one GOP official. "I don't think anybody knows the answer
to that. That question has not been answered yet, yes or no."</TE>
<TE>   The White House, meantime, was gauging the political damage to
determine whether President Bush should proceed with plans for a
California swing and a joint fund-raising appearances with Simon
later this month.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud verdict against Simon's firm--described as "the f-bomb"
by one Republican strategist in Sacramento--was the latest blow to a
campaign that has stumbled repeatedly since the first-time candidate
emerged as the surprise winner of March's GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   Rapid staff turnover, infighting among his top strategists and a
prolonged controversy over the release of Simon's personal income tax
returns have all sapped his candidacy and hurt his fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud verdict poses a particular threat to Simon, because it
strikes at the rationale for his candidacy: that his business acumen
has prepared him to be governor of the nation's largest state.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy had grown perilous even before the verdicts were
rendered, as headlines about financial debacles at Enron, WorldCom
and other companies shook faith in corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican strategist described a "meltdown" in Simon's
support among GOP donors, even before the fraud verdict produced
front-page headlines across the state Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis of Simon's fund-raising shows a dramatic decline
in large contributions since Bush headlined a series of fund-raisers
in the spring--underscoring the import of the president's visible
support for the GOP nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign took in an average of $26,000 a day in donations
of more than $5,000 in July--a third of the rate for June--and the
number of donors also dropped precipitously.</TE>
<TE>   While some of the June total is likely to have reflected an effort
to boost donations by month's end, when holdings had to be reported
to the state, the decline was still striking. But the political
effect of the verdict was not limited to Simon's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   His planned visit puts Bush in an awkward position as he attempts
to bolster his party in California and his own credentials on
corporate accountability.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't go [to California], conservatives will scream foul
and Simon supporters will say the president promised to help him and
broke his word," said Stuart Rothenberg, an independent analyst and
election handicapper in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "If he goes, then the president has painted a target on his
forehead for Democrats to say he talks about punishing white-collar
criminals and corporate executives who commit fraud, but raises money
for them."</TE>
<TE>   The latest problem came unexpectedly Wednesday in Los Angeles
Superior Court. The case involved Simon's family investment firm and
a deal to take control of a pay telephone company.</TE>
<TE>   The jury found that William E. Simon &amp; Sons had committed fraud
and other misconduct and ordered the firm to pay $65 million in
punitive damages, in addition to $13.3 million in compensatory
damages assessed a day earlier. Simon himself was not named as a
defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning Thursday in Los Angeles, Simon sought to defuse the
controversy at a tense news conference at John C. Fremont High
School.</TE>
<TE>   Simon insisted "there was no fraud" in the transaction and
expressed confidence the verdict would be overturned. While he said
the ruling was "fatally flawed," he declined to say how. "I'll leave
it to the lawyers to argue it out in court," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the political consequences, Simon called the verdict little
more than "a bump in the road," and fairly taunted Davis to try to
make more of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure now that Davis' people are busily making new ads, and I
hope they do," Simon said. "Because if they want to attack me now for
a bad verdict and take the side of a convicted drug trafficker ...
then Davis is welcome to choose that side."</TE>
<TE>   Simon was referring to the plaintiff in the fraud case, P. Edward
Hindelang of Santa Barbara. Hindelang, who sold most of his phone
company, Pacific Coin, to the Simon investment firm, had been
convicted of marijuana trafficking in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In reaching its verdict, the Superior Court jury dismissed a claim
by the Simon investors that Hindelang had defrauded them by
concealing his conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Simon forecast, Davis took to the airwaves Thursday with
yet another ad attacking his rival's ethics--only this one involved
Simon's connection with a failed savings and loan and an offshore tax
shelter under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service.</TE>
<TE>   The governor himself brought up the court case at a stop in
Sacramento, likening the verdict and IRS investigation to the
corporate scandals involving Enron and WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get socked with [$78 million in damages] just for
jaywalking," Davis told reporters after a speech to Latino business
and community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the kind of [issues] that have turned people off,"
Davis went on. "I think people are in no mood for the kind of
businessman with questionable ethics."</TE>
<TE>   While Davis' comments were predictable, more worrisome for Simon
was the criticism from his fellow Republicans, who were stunned by
the jury's decision--as were some of Simon's top advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the size of the verdict, it makes you wonder--both from a
litigation perspective and certainly from a political
perspective--why this case wasn't settled," said Arnold Steinberg, a
GOP strategist who has worked for a number of wealthy
businessmen-turned-candidates, including former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand how the campaign could be blind-sided by
long-standing litigation whose outcome is decided by a unanimous
jury," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Or as one Republican strategist in Washington put it, "If you're
fined $78 million, you did something pretty bad. That's the bottom
line."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the faithful were given over to gloom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not over. The fat lady hasn't sung," said Kevin Spillane, a
GOP strategist in Sacramento who has been critical of the Simon
campaign in the past. "This race is going to be competitive to the
very end, simply because Gray Davis remains very unpopular. And this
lawsuit doesn't impact Californians in the same way Gray Davis'
mistakes and fund-raising abuses have."</TE>
<TE>   And uncomfortable as it may be, some say Bush has little choice
but to follow through and honor his commitment to Simon. Invitations
have already gone out for this month's events, hosted by businessmen
Alex Spanos and David Murdock.</TE>
<TE>   Invitations for the Murdock event ask for contributions of as much
as $100,000 for "preferred seating" and two photographs with Bush at
Murdock's Ventura farm.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing Bush could do now is cut and run," said Scott
Reed, a Republican consultant in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans have been demoralized in California over the last few
elections. Bush has an opportunity to put California back in the
Republican column, and the Simon campaign is a steppingstone," he
said. "They have to help Simon. They have no choice."</TE>

<KH>HEBREW UNIVERSITY BOMBING</KH>
<HD>Love of Israel Kept American Victims There</HD>
<DH>Profiles: They were very aware of dangers but thought of
the university as a refuge.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>When friends and family members pleaded with Marla Bennett to return
home to San Diego to escape the violence in Israel, she assured them
that she was being careful.</LD>
<LD>   She avoided public transportation, political rallies and crowded
public places. She thought carefully about where she ate and which
route she took to school. Yet the 24-year-old acknowledged that, in
the Jerusalem of today, even meticulous planning might not be good
enough to ensure her safety.</LD>
<LD>   In April, she e-mailed a cousin in Los Angeles: ''I admit it.
Israel is really scary right now.''</LD>
<TE>   And yet, Bennett had told friends, she wanted to remain in Israel
as a sign that Jews should not be intimidated by terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a front-row seat for the history of the Jewish people,"
she wrote in a column in May for a San Diego Jewish newspaper. "I am
part of the struggle for Israel's survival."</TE>
<TE>   When a bomb ripped through a cafeteria at Hebrew University on
Wednesday, the promising college student's forebodings proved
tragically correct. Bennett and six others, four of them Americans,
were killed in the explosion, which injured nearly 100 more.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were Bennett, who was studying Hebrew in preparation
for a career as a teacher and administrator in the Jewish school
system; Benjamin Blutstein, 25, of Harrisburg, Pa.; Dina Carter, 38,
a librarian who held dual Israeli-American citizenship; Janis Ruth
Coulter, 36, a teacher at the Hebrew University's branch in New York;
and David Gritz, 24, who held dual American-French citizenship,
living in Paris and the Berkshires in western Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Some had been drawn to Jerusalem by a long-standing commitment to
Israel, others by a desire to understand the nation's mixture of
cultures and religions. All had hoped that they would remain safe at
the university, long a popular outpost for Americans and other
exchange students.</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew Bennett, an honors graduate at Patrick Henry High
School in San Diego and then UC Berkeley, spoke of her particular
dedication to her second home, despite the spiraling violence that
sent many others home.</TE>
<TE>   "She felt it was her calling to stay in Israel," said Hyim
Brandes, a teacher in Los Angeles, one of Bennett's friends who
decided to leave. "She genuinely believed that the school was safe
from attacks and that she would be safe if she avoided dangerous
places."</TE>
<TE>   Friends remembered her Thursday as a bright, enthusiastic young
woman who was dedicated to helping others. Even as the violence
worsened, she remained optimistic that someday Arabs and Jews would
learn to live peacefully. She collected clothes to be distributed to
poor Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "She took precautions. She tried to stay safe," sobbed Julie
Jacobson, 24, a lifelong friend in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "She loved life. She loved Judaism," said an equally distraught
Emma Lefkowitz, 24. Two months ago, Bennett returned to San Diego to
serve as maid of honor at Lefkowitz's wedding. "We were all so happy
that day," Lefkowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The three friends--who jokingly referred to themselves as the
Three Musketeers--were to be reunited this weekend when Bennett
arrived for a vacation before returning to her studies at the Pardes
Institute, which has a joint degree program with Hebrew University.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents--Michael, an insurance company executive, and Linda, a
columnist with the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage--remained in
seclusion Thursday. The couple's other child, Lisa, 29, works at the
San Diego Jewish Academy.</TE>
<TE>   "Marla was an extraordinary young lady," said Norman Greene,
co-publisher of the newspaper and a friend of the Bennett family. "In
everything she did she was top, top, top. She was her parents' joy.
And now she's gone."</TE>
<TE>   In high school, she was student body president, a cheerleader, a
journalist and a leader in social causes, such as seeking solutions
for homelessness. At Berkeley, she studied political science, taking
her junior year at Hebrew University.</TE>
<TE>   "She loved Israel and said many times that she felt at home
there," said Josh Miller, who worked at the Hillel Jewish student
center at Berkeley. "She was a take-charge type, but in a gentle way.
She had a wonderful warmth and everybody wanted to have conversations
with her. This is all so very sad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blutstein had been studying in Jerusalem to become a teacher of
Judaic Studies and was about to start a two-year master's program.
Like Bennett, he was set to return home for summer vacation. He had
been a leader in the Jewish community at Dickinson University in
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, he had e-mailed Andrea Lieber, his former neighbor and
professor at Dickinson, to offer to lead discussion groups on campus
about Israel while he was back: "As someone who has experienced the
intifada [the Palestinian uprising] first hand, I think I could
provide an interesting perspective for them."</TE>
<TE>   Karim Youssef, an Arab-American and a good friend of Blutstein's
at Dickinson University, saw him as a potential peacemaker: "We
respectfully disagreed on a lot of issues with each other, but
overall, we reached the fact that we're both human beings and it
didn't really matter how much we disagreed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carter was employed at the Jewish National and University Library
as a librarian and archivist in the manuscripts department and
archives. Born in North Carolina, she earned a bachelor's degree from
Duke University and a master's in social welfare from the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Carter immigrated to Israel in 1990. Rafi Weiser, head of the
library's manuscripts department, described Carter as "perceptive,
intelligent, well educated, with a winning personality."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coulter had been inspired to convert to Judaism by her studies of
the Holocaust. A teacher at Hebrew University's American branch, the
Rothberg International School in New York, Coulter had escorted a
group of 19 American graduate students to Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Coulter had gone with the students to visit the Western Wall
Wednesday, then sat down in the cafeteria for lunch with a friend.
Most of the students ate quickly, then left to settle into their new
dorms, but Coulter lingered over her lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Barbara Penzer of Temple Hillel B'nai Torah in Boston said
that Coulter had felt at home in Israel, and, despite her
apprehensions about safety, felt going there was not an act of
courage, but an act of love.</TE>
<TE>   Coulter's family issued a statement that said, "Janis Ruth was a
wonderful, loving, caring person. Her faith, to which she converted,
was at the core of her being."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gritz had been scheduled to start classes in Hebrew at the
university on Thursday. After graduating from the Sorbonne in Paris,
he had turned down a grant for graduate study in Berlin in favor of
the program at Hebrew University.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fascinated by Jerusalem as a place where different
cultures and religions come together," said a family friend, Nancy
Kreger.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Croatian mother who is an artist and an American
father who is a teacher, Gritz spent most of the year in Paris and
summered in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts with his family.</TE>
<TE>   Kreger spoke of him as a young man on the verge of making his way
in the world, but one who still liked to play basketball and swim.
"He was a fun-loving, lovely person,' she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bennett had planed to attend a bar mitzvah and a wedding in San
Diego on Saturday. Instead, her funeral is planned Monday at the
city's Tifereth Israel Synagogue. Her boyfriend, Michael Simon of
Long Beach, was set to accompany the body on the flight from Israel
to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   She had graduated from Berkeley in May 2000, also receiving the
Hineini Award for leadership from the Hillel group. She had formed a
discussion group for Jewish women and mentored young students about
the meaning of religion in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the glue that held it [Hillel] together," said Adam
Weisberg, the organization's executive director in Berkeley. "She was
the person you hoped to have as a friend or that your child would
have as a teacher."</TE>
<TE>   She returned to Jerusalem for the intellectually rigorous courses
at the Pardes Institute. When not studying, she traveled to the
Ukraine to organize a Passover Seder for Jews there. Her faith
deepened and she began observing the Sabbath and keeping a kosher
table.</TE>
<TE>   In traditional Berkeley fashion, Bennett was "a bit of a
peacenik," said Greene, the San Diego publisher.</TE>
<TE>   "She was bringing clothing to Arab families," he said. "She was
interested in human beings and finding a peaceful resolution to the
Arab-Israeli conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brandes: "She really was hopeful that someday there would be
peace. She cared about a lot of people and was cared about by a lot
of people."</TE>
<TE>   Greene said Bennett's father told him that he has been "in fear of
this day" ever since his daughter returned to Israel amid the
violence. At the family home near San Diego State University, friends
kept a daylong vigil Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl issued a statement that
the Berkeley community is "shocked and grief-stricken" by Bennett's
death.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all shocked and devastated," said Shaked Halaby, a Los
Angeles accountant who studied with Bennett in Jerusalem. "No one
thought this could happen at the university. The campus is surrounded
by walls and gates. But now we know that's not enough."</TE>

<HD>FBI Returns to Md. Home in Anthrax Probe</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Agents spend several hours in a second search of a
former Army scientist's apartment.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI agents conducted a second search of the Maryland home of a former
Army scientist Thursday in connection with the investigation into the
anthrax attacks that killed five people and sickened at least 13
others last fall.</LD>
<LD>   Officials obtained a federal warrant authorizing the search of the
apartment of Dr. Steven J. Hatfill, who worked as a bioweapon
specialist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases at Ft. Detrick, Md., from 1997 to 1999. Hatfill's modest
apartment is in Frederick, Md., just outside the sprawling Army
complex and about 45 miles from the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Hatfill, who has publicly declared his innocence, gave his consent
to an initial search of his apartment in June.</LD>
<TE>   But on Thursday, FBI agents returned after a judge approved their
request to again search the premises.</TE>
<TE>   FBI and Justice Department officials would not comment Thursday on
why they wanted to return or what they found after spending several
hours combing through the apartment and a nearby dumpster.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also declined to say whether Hatfill, 48, has become a
suspect or is merely one of several dozen people who fit some general
profile of a person who the FBI believes sent the deadly
bacteria-laden letters. They stressed that he had not been taken into
custody or even interviewed as agents searched his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are not going to characterize this guy in any way,
shape or form," said a senior FBI official Thursday evening, adding
that the bureau was actively investigating several dozen people
without classifying any of them as formal suspects. Many of them are
scientists who work at Ft. Detrick and other government laboratories
and universities where anthrax is studied, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at a lot of different people. Someone could safely
characterize any of those people as suspects, but I'm not sure we
have anyone that we would hang that label [of prime suspect] on,"
said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We are
doing a lot of investigating all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   Another FBI official, however, said the bureau has, within the
last several days, become far more suspicious of Hatfill.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into the scientist "began as due diligence, but
in pursuing all possibilities, it has now become more than that.
There is a greater sense of urgency and anticipation."</TE>
<TE>   Recent searches and developments in the investigation into Hatfill
have "created a lot of interest and a lot of activity and a lot [of]
enthusiasm," said the FBI official, who is privy to the scientific
aspects of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill was "in the area" during the search, according to the FBI
official, who asked to remain anonymous. The official would not
comment on neighbors' reports that a car belonging to Hatfill had
been towed away.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials say there is a tremendous amount of secrecy in the
ongoing investigation, stressing that they do not want to unfairly
smear anyone, including Hatfill, by simply searching their belongings
and conducting other aspects of the wide-ranging investigation.</TE>
<TE>   One agent cited the case of Richard Jewell, the Atlanta security
guard whom the FBI quickly identified as the only suspect in the July
1996 bomb blast that killed one and injured 111 during the Atlanta
Olympics. Jewell was cleared three months later and filed lawsuits
against news outlets that reported the FBI claim; Atty. Gen. Janet
Reno formally apologized to him the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Hatfill at a news briefing, FBI Director Robert S.
Mueller III had little to say.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't get into what is being undertaken in the course of the
investigation, but I do believe we're making progress," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer, Thomas
C. Carter, did not return calls, though he did tell a Baltimore TV
station that Hatfill had done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of many scientists who are undergoing the same scrutiny
by the authorities, but for some reason, his name keeps popping up,"
Carter told WJZ-TV in a telephone interview. "But he's a patriot.
He's going to continue to cooperate in every way."</TE>
<TE>   The first anthrax-laden letters were sent last fall, initially
targeting a tabloid newspaper office in Florida and, later, two
senators in Washington and media outlets in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the FBI circulated a psychological profile of the
suspected killer, saying that he was believed to be a male with a
scientific background, with access to anthrax and with certain
vaccinations designed to prevent infection from the spores.</TE>
<TE>   Some Justice Department officials suggested Thursday that Hatfill
fits that profile, at least in part. But in other respects, his
career and personality seem at odds with the official profile.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the FBI profile describes the suspect as a "loner"
who "lacks the personal skills necessary to confront others," whereas
Hatfill has been outspoken over the years about the threat posed by
bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Mueller said the bureau still ascribes to the "lone
wolf" theory.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill, who was born and raised in central Illinois, attended
college in Kansas. In the late 1970s, after a brief marriage that
ended in divorce, he traveled to Zimbabwe, then known as Rhodesia, to
attend medical school.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a medical degree, Hatfill went on to earn other
advanced degrees, including a doctorate in molecular cell biology. He
lived and worked in South Africa and England and also served for 14
months as a medical officer and science team leader at an Antarctic
research center.</TE>
<TE>   After working on Ebola and other viruses at the infectious
diseases institute until 1999, Hatfill took a job with Science
Applications International Corp. He was at SAIC from January 1999
until March, company spokesman Ben Haddad said. Not long after
starting work at SAIC, Hatfill and a colleague commissioned a private
study into what would happen if powdered anthrax was sent through the
mail, Haddad confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill began a new job July 1 as an associate director of
Louisiana State University's National Center for Biomedical Research
and Training. The director there said that he had been assured by FBI
officials last month that Hatfill was not a suspect in the anthrax
probe.</TE>
<TE>   In March, in a rare public comment on the case, Hatfill told the
Baltimore Sun that the controversy has unfairly hurt him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this field for a number of years, working until 3
o'clock in the morning, trying to counter this type of weapon of mass
destruction, and, sir, my career is over at this time," he said.</TE>

<HD>3 Killed When Billboard Collapses at Georgia Mall</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SNELLVILLE, Ga.</DL>
<LD>A 35,000-pound billboard collapsed at a suburban Atlanta shopping
center Thursday, killing three construction workers who were crushed
by the falling steel.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth worker was pulled from the wreckage and hospitalized in
good condition, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We heard this big crash, so we looked over and we saw this huge
sign just fall," Truly Scott, who witnessed the incident, told
WAGA-TV. "There was blood everywhere. It was awful to see."</LD>
<TE>   The billboard, roughly 30 by 60 feet, was under construction when
it collapsed just before noon at the shopping center. It crashed onto
two cars and into the side of a building below. No one else was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The workers who died fell 40 feet as the sign buckled. They were
identified as Josh Fowler, 23; his brother Anthony, 21; and Lance
Stofiel, 26. The injured worker was identified as electrician Clyde
Elrod, 37.</TE>
<TE>   The billboard was designed to switch among three advertisements
using rotating boards. Structural work on the billboard was complete,
and the crew was doing electrical work, Gwinnett County fire Lt.
David Dusik said.</TE>

<LD>Government attorneys asked a judge to continue the forced medication
of Russell Eugene Weston Jr., who is accused of killing two Capitol
police officers in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Sally Johnson, a psychiatrist with the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, said Weston's condition appears to have improved since he
began taking the anti-psychotic medicine in January. Johnson said
there is a substantial probability the medicine could help Weston
regain his competence within 18 months.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors hope the medicine will make Weston stable enough to
stand trial on federal murder charges.</LD>
<TE>   Weston is accused of gunning down officers Jacob Chestnut and John
Gibson at their posts inside the Capitol. He could face the death
penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Weston's public defender, A.J. Kramer, said his client is
delusional and has not improved.</TE>

<LD>Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he will not support legislation to
merge Wendover, Utah, and West Wendover, Nev., into one city in
Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Reid's decision, in what city and federal elected officials said
was his first comment on the issue, effectively kills the bill during
the current session of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "Think about the investments in these huge hotels, where people
spent millions of dollars to be first on the state line," Reid told
Associated Press. "This bill is not going to pass this year."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the legislative setback, officials in both cities said
they would go ahead with November referendums on the annexation. The
two Wendovers support moving the state line and consolidating to
reduce the cost of providing duplicate school, police, fire and
municipal services.</TE>

<HD>2 Kids With Cancer Get Accidental Overdoses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Two cancer-stricken children were mistakenly given chemotherapy
overdoses by a doctor at Johns Hopkins Children's Center, and one of
them may have gone deaf as a result, health officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The child who lost his hearing, a critically ill 2-year-old boy,
received twice the correct dose of the cancer drug carboplatin on
three successive days in late May, the state health department said.</LD>
<LD>   A 3-year-old girl also was given an overdose around the same time,
but the dose was corrected after one treatment and no harm was done,
the agency said.</LD>
<TE>   Carol Benner, director of the state Office of Health Care Quality,
said Thursday the overdoses were the doctor's error. She would not
identify the doctor or the children.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have hoped that a nurse would have picked it up or the
pharmacy would have picked it up and it didn't happen, so this is a
clear example of a system's breakdown," Benner said.</TE>
<TE>   Benner said hearing loss is a known risk of the medication, so it
was not certain whether the boy's deafness was a result of receiving
too much. However, the overdose significantly increased the risk, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital spokesman Gary Stephenson issued a statement
acknowledging the error.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopkins deeply regrets the accidental dosing error with an
anticancer drug being used to prepare a critically ill ... child for
a bone marrow transplant," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the hospital had systems in place to make sure doses are
correct. The hospital discovered the overdose during a routine check,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the boy's overdose prompted hospital officials to
review dosages for five other patients, and that turned up the second
overdose.</TE>
<TE>   The state agency could fine the hospital up to $10,000 and impose
restrictions if Hopkins does not take steps to prevent another such
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Benner said the children's facility has cooperated fully.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not appear to be a pattern," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy who became deaf suffered from neuroblastoma, the third
most common cancer in children and one that typically attacks the
adrenal glands or nerves in the back of the abdomen. Benner said the
child may be regaining some hearing, but it remains unclear how much.</TE>
<TE>   She said the boy eventually did receive the bone marrow transplant
and seems to be recovering.</TE>

<HD>Heart Attack Death Prompts Call for Improvements on Train

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The sister of a man who suffered a heart attack on a commuter train
that made two more stops before he was taken off said Thursday that
she hoped for changes in training and safety equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Jeanne Peterson said her brother, James Allen, would want
something positive to come from his death, such as requiring
cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for crews and defibrillators
on trains.</LD>
<LD>   "Jim was a very logical person, a patient, down-to-earth thinker,"
she said. "I have to think the logic here means training in CPR and
defibrillators."</LD>
<TE>   Allen, 61, died of a heart attack at a hospital Tuesday about 20
minutes after he was stricken on the train. The train made two
regularly scheduled stops, even though the conductor knew Allen was
unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant conductor Susan Bergeron administered CPR to Allen after
he collapsed at 8:52 a.m. The train stopped twice before paramedics
boarded at Boston's Back Bay station.</TE>
<TE>   Bergeron has defended the crew, saying it would have been
dangerous to rush through stations without stopping.</TE>

<HD>Senate Passes Measure to Increase Defense Spending by $34.4
Billion</HD>
<DH>Politics: The $355.4- billion bill reflects the largest
increase in 20 years. It includes funds for a missile shield and a
4.1% personnel pay hike.</DH>

<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Thursday passed a $355.4-billion defense appropriation
bill for 2003 that will deliver to the Pentagon the huge infusion of
funds sought by President Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The measure adds $34.4 billion to the U.S. defense budget. It was
approved by a vote of 95 to 3, with little debate.</LD>
<LD>   The increase was the largest in two decades for the Pentagon,
which accounts for about 40% of the world's total spending on
military weaponry. Funding for procurement, research, personnel and
operations-and-maintenance programs all grow by at least 9% in the
Senate bill.</LD>
<TE>   The House approved its version of the legislation in June.</TE>
<TE>   The two chambers must resolve their differences in a conference
committee.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement after the vote, Bush praised the Senate for
moving quickly and urged lawmakers to finalize the legislation by
early next month, after they return from their summer recess after
Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   "With our nation at war, it is imperative that we address the
important priority of ensuring that our troops have the resources
they need," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House failed to get into the measure a $10-billion war
contingency fund that the administration would control. Congress
objected to the plan, saying that it would infringe on legislators'
prerogative to control spending. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii),
who chairs the subcommittee that crafted the bill, said the funds
would be included in subsequent legislation.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the White House budget office urged approval of
the bill, even though $11.4 billion had been cut from the president's
request. The war contingency fund accounted for most of that money.</TE>
<TE>   Passage of the measure means that the Senate made good on its
pledge to clear the defense budget bill before Congress leaves for
the monthlong recess.</TE>
<TE>   Key disagreements were already settled before the bill reached the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   A deal was struck to save jobs from the canceled $11-billion
Crusader artillery program. The bill provides $278 million for new
Army combat systems, including a replacement for the 40-ton Crusader
howitzer, itself a new weapon system but one that was deemed too
heavy for the new, faster-moving style of warfare.</TE>
<TE>   And lawmakers settled a dispute over funds that Democratic
lawmakers had sought to delete from the administration's missile
defense program. The compromise will allow the administration to
replace $814 million in deleted funds from lower-than-expected
inflation and to spend it on either missile defense or
counterterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would further increase military salaries, which have been
hiked repeatedly in recent years. This year's increase would add 4.1%
to the pay of all service members.</TE>
<TE>   As often happens, the Senate chose to spend more on some
procurement programs than the administration had sought.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill provides $3.3 billion to buy 15 C-17 cargo planes,
three more than the administration had asked for. The House version
would buy 12.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill would provide $250 million to buy 21 UH-60 Black
Hawk helicopters for the Army, nine more than the Bush administration
wanted. It would provide $315 million to buy the Navy four KC-130J
refueling planes that had not been requested.</TE>
<TE>   It also provides money for the purchase of 23 F-22 radar-evading
fighters for the Air Force and 11 V-22 tilt-rotor Ospreys for the
Marines, as Bush proposed.</TE>
<TE>   The measure provides $9.2 billion to purchase four new Navy ships,
four submarine refueling overhauls and other vessels. That is $960
million more than the administration sought for shipbuilding.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) abandoned
last-minute plans to try to kill the Pentagon's proposal to lease
four Boeing 737s for ferrying administration officials and lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   McCain said the deal is too expensive and denies other companies a
chance to compete. But it appeared that he would have failed if his
challenge had been put to a vote.</TE>

<HD>Nevada's Malpractice Limits May Be Challenged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARSON CITY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Nevada lawmakers' solution to the state's medical malpractice
insurance crisis may be challenged on constitutional grounds, trial
lawyers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The lawmakers ended a special session just after 4 a.m. Thursday
by imposing a $350,000 cap on lawsuit awards. The session had been
ordered by Republican Gov. Kenny Guinn to try to end a health-care
crisis caused by soaring malpractice insurance premiums.</LD>
<LD>   "Any time you take away someone's right to a jury trial on
substantive issues, you run the risk of a constitutional challenge,"
said Jerry Gillock of the Nevada Trial Lawyers Assn.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't like to forecast doom for the bill. But there are a
number of states where caps have been struck down."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the $350,000 cap on pain-and-suffering awards in medical
malpractice cases, the new law also has a $50,000 liability cap on
all trauma centers and emergency rooms in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Gillock said the $50,000 cap's initial purpose was to protect
government-run medical facilities, but the provision was expanded to
any trauma center or emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sovereign immunity issue, not a cap issue," he said. "So
to do this for the multibillion-dollar corporations that run our
private hospitals is a real problem."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bradley of the Nevada Trial Lawyers Assn. also criticized the
new law, saying special interests got "the upper hand at the expense
of society in general."</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unfortunate day when the right to a jury trial is
sacrificed for the greed and profits of an insurance industry that
couldn't explain how these limitations will improve the health-care
system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The law change was praised by Guinn, who said it will help keep
doctors in the state because they can look forward to lower rates in
a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe what the doctors were looking for, what they really
wanted, was the ability to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"
the governor added.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ikram Khan, a Las Vegas general surgeon who helped lead the
cap effort, called the new law "a major, significant accomplishment"
that would help lower premiums and stabilize the insurance market.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance industry lobbyist Jim Wadhams said insurers will want to
see whether the plan can survive court challenges. But, he added,
"it's a positive change. It will just take time."</TE>
<TE>   Nevada is one of a dozen states troubled by rising premiums, tied
to awards by state juries in malpractice cases, according to the
American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Trial lawyers countered that juries rule in favor of doctors in
two-thirds of all malpractice lawsuits, and the key is to limit
mistakes by doctors and hospitals rather than limit jury awards.</TE>

<HD>2 Girls Killed in Elevator Accident; Safety Feature Wasn't
Functioning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FREEHOLD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A safety mechanism was taped over and not working when two girls were
killed in an elevator in a multimillion-dollar home, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Someone taped over the sensor that would have kept the car from
operating with the gate open, Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye
said.</LD>
<LD>   The victims of Wednesday night's accident were identified as
Arelia Franco, 7, and her sister, Nanci, 6. Their father, Victoriano
Franco, is the groundskeeper for the 10-acre Colts Neck estate.</LD>
<TE>   The girls were lying down in the elevator with their heads
partially across the threshold as the car ascended from the basement.
They were killed when their heads were wedged against a piece of the
elevator shaft.</TE>
<TE>   "If that gate was closed, this would not have happened," Kaye
said.</TE>
<TE>   The girls' father was out looking for the owner's dog when the
accident happened. When he discovered what had happened, he
frantically pried open the elevator doors and severely cut his hands
in the process, Kaye said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives did not know who placed the tape over the sensor. The
deaths were considered an accident and not being investigated as a
crime, Kaye said.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Curb Forest Fires Wins Support</HD>
<DH>Environment: Thirteen senators back measure, but activists
say logging companies see profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Thirteen senators, all but one from the West, announced their support
Thursday for a plan to reduce the risk of catastrophic forest fires
on federal land by cleaning out underbrush, thinning trees and--if
necessary--building roads to provide emergency vehicles with access
to remote forest regions.</LD>
<LD>   The senators--12 Republicans plus Democrat Dianne Feinstein of
California--identified 23 million acres of federal land constituting
a "vast, dry tinderbox" that could ignite at the careless drop of a
match. The 23 million acres are scattered among the 50 states but
concentrated in a few. California has 7 million acres under federal
control.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to move quickly," Feinstein said. "Otherwise we risk
losing the majesty of the West."</LD>
<TE>   But the plan is anathema to environmentalists, who warn of logging
companies spoiling the beauty of the nation's forests by stripping
out their finest trees.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden they're going to go to 23 million acres and
ignore environmental laws and clear [growth] out," said Sean
Cosgrove, the Sierra Club's national forest planning specialist.
Instead, he said, the public must come to recognize fire as a natural
way that forests are renewed.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Hanson, executive director of the John Muir Project,
predicted that the logging companies hired to reduce the risk of fire
would clear out not only the underbrush but also the tall, healthy
trees that they can sell for a good profit.</TE>
<TE>   "These senators are the timber industry's best friends in Congress
...," Hanson said. "It's all about extracting timber and not about
reducing the fire risk."</TE>
<TE>   The program endorsed by the senators would get underway next year
and last 18 months. It is patterned on an amendment attached by
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) to a bill appropriating
anti-terrorism funds for the current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's amendment authorizes a forest management program in
Black Hills National Forest without resort to a typically lengthy
judicial review and appeals process.</TE>
<TE>   The 13 senators said they were looking for one of the regular
annual spending bills for the next fiscal year to which they could
attach their more far-reaching proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, a "fire suppression" policy that environmental groups,
business and the government all dislike is in place, a remnant from
the early 1900s. Fire suppression focuses on putting out blazes once
they light, but it does nothing to alleviate the conditions that can
breed catastrophic fires.</TE>
<TE>   More than 4.2 million acres of prime forested land nationwide have
burned this year, the most ever. The charred land would leave a 2
1/3-mile-wide strip of land from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles. An
additional 1 million acres are expected to burn this month. Just
Wednesday, 85,000 acres burned.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service has exhausted its $700,000 budget to fight
the fires and has raided the piggy banks of other previously approved
projects--including several fire management programs--and delayed
them to fund the additional firefighting.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 GOP senators are Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, Jon Kyl of
Arizona, Larry E. Craig of Idaho, Conrad R. Burns of Montana, Frank
H. Murkowski of Alaska, Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Ben
Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, Gordon Smith of Oregon, Christopher
S. Bond of Missouri, Michael D. Crapo of Idaho and John Ensign of
Nevada.</TE>

<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Katherine Harris resigned Thursday as Florida's secretary of state
and made the move retroactive to July 15, saying she had
misunderstood the rules about when she had to quit to run for
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Harris, a Republican who as the state's chief election official
was thrust into the international spotlight during the 2000
presidential election recount, said she had intended to quit later
this month to focus on the congressional race.</LD>
<LD>   But the state's resign-to-run law required her to file a letter on
the day she qualified to run for Congress stating her intent to
resign. Otherwise, the law says, the candidate must resign
immediately.</LD>
<TE>   "I made a mistake in not filing the letter," Harris said, adding
that she thought the law did not apply to her office.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said that he had accepted
the resignation but that Harris will be acting secretary until a
successor is named.</TE>

<HD>Negotiations Fail on Bill of Rights for HMO Patients</HD>
<DH>Health: Democrats in the Senate are unable to reach a deal
with the White House. A major point of contention is the extent of
lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Another major health bill ran aground in Congress on Thursday, one
day after legislation to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs
died in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Prospects dimmed for a bill that would give new protections for
patients of managed health-care plans, as Senate Democrats announced
that negotiations with the White House on the issue had collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   "I regret that we continue to be unable to reach an agreement on
[a] patients' bill of rights," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.),
a leader on the issue.</LD>
<TE>   The talks between Senate Democrats and the administration had been
considered the best hope for resolving differences between versions
of the bill approved last year by the House and Senate. Both sides
said the talks collapsed because they could not bridge differences
over the extent of rights that patients should be given to sue their
health maintenance organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, a leading Republican proponent of
passing a patients' rights bill, said he believes the collapse of the
talks effectively killed the measure for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic leaders said they would seek to convene a House-Senate
conference committee to continue negotiations. But Norwood and others
close to the process called that a futile gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "If negotiations between the White House and Sen. Kennedy could
not succeed, adding a dozen more voices isn't going to make things
any better," Norwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats hung their hopes for breaking the impasse on the current
anti-corporate climate. They hope that will put pressure on their
Republican colleagues to make concessions on the bill rather than
continue to defend the interests of HMOs, which oppose the more
stringent bill passed by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is an effort to make it harder for HMOs to deny patients
coverage for needed care. There is agreement on several provisions.
Both the House and Senate versions would, for example, guarantee
patient access to certain specialists and emergency room services.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill passed by the GOP-controlled House would impose
stricter limits on patient lawsuits than the Senate measure,
including a cap on pain-and-suffering and punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and other Republicans argue that the limits on
damages would discourage frivolous lawsuits and the big jury awards
that they say drive up health insurance premiums. Democrats said that
more robust legal rights are needed to give teeth to patient
protections.</TE>
<TE>   The policy dispute has strong political overtones because
Republicans receive considerable financial support from HMOs and
Democrats are strongly allied with trial lawyers who oppose limiting
damages.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of a patients' rights bill was ranked by Democrats as
their first priority when they won control of the Senate in mid-2001
after Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont left the GOP to become an
independent.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has been conducting negotiations on a compromise
since last winter with Kennedy and others, including Sens. John
Edwards (D-N.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the three senators wrote to Bush urging him to get more
involved in breaking the impasse. After receiving no response,
Kennedy called Nicholas E. Calio, the White House's chief
congressional lobbyist, to tell him he thought the talks were
stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Calio said he agreed. "The president still would like a bill, and
both sides tried to be very creative. But we can't bridge the
liability gap," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Each side was left accusing the other of being pawns of special
interests.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, the administration was more committed to maintaining
special preferences for HMOs and big insurance companies than passing
legislation that would protect patients," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan responded in kind: "The
issue appears to be whether or not the interest of powerful
personal-injury trial lawyers will prevail over the health-care needs
of the American people."</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Polygraphs Sought in Leak Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI agents have questioned nearly all 37 members of the Senate and
House intelligence committees and have asked many if they would be
willing to submit to polygraph tests as part of a broad investigation
into leaks of classified information related to the Sept. 11 attacks,
according to officials involved in the inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the lawmakers have told the FBI they would refuse a
polygraph, citing the constitutional separation of powers between the
legislative and executive branches of government and the
unreliability of the exam, those involved in the inquiry said.</LD>
<LD>   Although the chairmen of the intelligence committees, Sen. Bob
Graham (D-Fla.) and Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), asked the FBI to
conduct the inquiry, the unprecedented scale of the investigation has
angered some lawmakers, according to people close to the probe. The
lawmakers are unhappy that the FBI, an agency over which they have
oversight responsibilities, is now investigating them.</LD>
<TE>   FBI agents also have questioned 60 congressional staff members as
well as officials at the CIA, Defense Department and National
Security Agency. They are trying to determine the source of news
stories that quoted Arabic communications making vague references to
an impending attack on the United States that were intercepted by the
NSA on Sept. 10 but not translated until Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Ranit Schmelzer, spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.), said Daschle had "grave concerns about the
congressional separation of powers issues raised by having one branch
of government asking to polygraph employees of another branch." But,
she added in a statement, "this matter is between the House and
Senate intelligence committees and the Justice Department. The
intelligence committees asked the Justice Department to conduct this
investigation and it is up to these parties to determine the
appropriate guidance" for members regarding the polygraph.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders established a joint House-Senate
intelligence panel this year to review the performance of the CIA,
FBI and other intelligence agencies leading up to the Sept. 11
attacks and to recommend changes to the intelligence community.</TE>
<TE>   As the panel's hearings got underway, stories appeared about the
NSA intercepts, drawing a heated White House rebuke. Administration
officials said the leaks may be a federal crime.</TE>

<DH>Animals: The National Zoo's two giant pandas are honored
with birthday party complete with treats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The National Zoo held a panda party for its most prominent residents
Thursday, celebrating the birthdays of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian.</LD>
<LD>   Mei Xiang, the female, turned 4 on July 22, and Tian Tian will
turn 5 on Aug 27. The zoo picked a date in between, and will focus on
the endangered species throughout August.</LD>
<LD>   "Today we're really celebrating all giant panda birthdays," zoo
director Lucy Spelman said. "Today is about our giant pandas here and
what we've learned about them in the past year and a half, what we
will continue to learn about them and how it applies to the wild
giant panda population."</LD>
<TE>   As thousands of guests ate slices of a cake decorated with bamboo
and replicas of the pandas, Mei Xiang lapped at a block of ice with
fruit in the middle. Tian Tian took a nap in his air-conditioned
grotto and was to have his frozen treat after he awoke, Spelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Both pandas were born at a China research and conservation center
dedicated to studying the giant panda. They came to the U.S. in
December 2000 and are on loan for 10 years to the zoo, which will pay
the Chinese government $10 million in return. They are the zoo's
second pair of pandas, replacing Ling-Ling, who died in 1992 and
Hsing-Hsing, who died in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The pandas lived together at first but were separated after their
first breeding season in May. The 262-pound Tian Tian had become too
aggressive in his play with the 217-pound Mei Xiang, and zoo
officials feared he might hurt her.</TE>
<TE>   They were kept apart while curators studied the pandas' behavior,
although they could see and smell each other. They were reunited July
25, after it became apparent that the two wanted to be together.</TE>
<TE>   "They are much more calm and adult-like in their play, right now,"
Spelman said. "It's not the chirping, rambunctious play that they did
when they first arrived."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists hope that their second mating season will be more
successful than the first.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of them are going through puberty right now and are just
reaching maturity," panda curator Lisa Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   There's a good chance the two will mate next year, Spelman said.
However, scientists realize successful reproduction would be a
longshot. No giant panda cub born at the National Zoo has ever
survived longer than a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo officials are also studying the pandas' everyday behavior so
they can customize a new habitat that will anchor an Asian animal
area, which they hope to begin building by the end of the year.</TE>

<HD>Compromise Ends Medicaid Pullout</HD>
<DH>Health: Three drugstore chains in Massachusetts fill
prescriptions again as state reconsiders rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Massachusetts' three largest drugstore chains will temporarily
continue to fill Medicaid prescriptions in exchange for the state's
reconsidering a planned cut in reimbursement rates.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Jane Swift announced the agreement Thursday, for now
resolving a dispute with CVS, Walgreens and Brooks Pharmacy. The
chains had threatened to withdraw from the state's Medicaid program
because of an 11% reduction in prescription reimbursement rates.</LD>
<LD>   Altogether, the companies operate more than half of Massachusetts'
1,014 drugstores and fill 60% of the state's Medicaid prescriptions.</LD>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Massachusetts will continue repaying
pharmacies for Medicaid prescriptions at the current rate until Oct.
2. In the meantime, the state will hold a public hearing and then set
an appropriate reimbursement rate.</TE>
<TE>   The new rate will be announced Oct. 2 and will be applied
retroactively to any prescriptions filled after Thursday, Swift said.</TE>
<TE>   CVS, the state's largest drugstore chain and the leader of the
pharmacy revolt, issued a statement welcoming Swift's action and
saying it has suspended its decision to stop filling Medicaid
prescriptions on Aug. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Walgreens confirmed the agreement but had no further comment. A
Brooks spokesman did not immediately return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Starting today, the state will also require pharmacies to give 30
days' notice before withdrawing from the state's Medicaid program.
Previously, pharmacies were not required to give any notice.</TE>
<TE>   State officials decided to reduce the reimbursement rate to help
keep down rising Medicaid costs.</TE>

<HD>Alexander Wins Tenn. GOP Senate Vote</HD>
<DH>Politics: The former presidential candidate will face
Democratic Rep. Bob Clement in November election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>In one of the country's most hard-fought and high-profile primaries,
Tennessee voters Thursday chose two-time presidential candidate Lamar
Alexander as the GOP nominee for a key November Senate battle.</LD>
<LD>   With Democratic control of the Senate hanging by a single seat,
the race to succeed Republican Sen. Fred Thompson could figure
prominently in the battle for Senate control.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander, 62, a former governor and U.S. Education secretary,
held a comfortable lead as counting continued late Thursday over Rep.
Ed Bryant, 53, a four-term congressman and House prosecutor in the
impeachment trial of former President Clinton.</LD>
<TE>   The Democratic nomination was captured by seven-term Democratic
Rep. Bob Clement, who had nominal opposition in the primary. Clement,
58, is son of the late former Gov. Frank Clement.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate seat from Tennessee came open with the surprise
retirement of Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   While Democrats have no open Senate seats, Republicans must defend
four created by the retirements of Sens. Strom Thurmond in South
Carolina, Jesse Helms in North Carolina, Phil Gramm in Texas and
Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander, who failed in bids for the GOP presidential nomination
in 1996 and 2000, has emphasized education and jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Clement's campaign has emphasized "security"--for the homeland,
Social Security, health care and education. He was first elected to
Congress in 1988 and reelected two years ago with 73% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee voters were also choosing candidates to succeed two-term
Republican Gov. Don Sundquist, who could not run again because of
term limits, and for the state's eight U.S. House seats, three of
which are open because incumbents decided to run for either governor
or the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Rep. Van Hilleary won the Republican gubernatorial
nomination, while former Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen was an easy
victor on the Democratic side.</TE>
<TE>   One House contest could provide former vice president and native
son Al Gore a reading on whether his popularity has improved in
Tennessee since he lost the state in the 2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Gore campaigned in the 4th Congressional District--the area he
once represented in the House--for Lincoln Davis, a state senator and
party favorite who beat fellow Democrat Fran Marcum, a millionaire
businesswoman.</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Deport Cuban Torturer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>An elderly Cuban immigrant was convicted Thursday of concealing his
past as a psychiatric nurse who tortured dissidents and other
political prisoners, and he will be stripped of his U.S. citizenship
and perhaps deported.</LD>
<LD>   A federal jury found that Eriberto Mederos, 79, who came to the
United States in 1984, lied on his citizenship application about his
actions over a 10-year period at Cuba's Mazorra Psychiatric Hospital,
where witnesses testified he administered electroshocks to foes of
Fidel Castro's regime. The jury also found that Mederos did not tell
the truth when he claimed to have never been associated with Cuba's
ruling Communist Party.</LD>
<LD>   Mederos was convicted of obtaining U.S. citizenship under false
pretenses, and he could be imprisoned for five years and fined
$250,000. According to federal officials, his citizenship will also
be revoked, and he may be sent back to his native island.</LD>
<TE>   "This verdict sends a strong message about the meaning of American
citizenship," U.S. Atty. Guy A. Lewis said. "It is a privilege that
has to be obtained lawfully, and human rights abuses are not
compatible with American citizenship. When the rights of human beings
are violated, you forfeit your right to be a United States citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of exile organizations based in Miami also hailed the
verdict, saying it should dissuade Cuban officials from mistreating
political opponents. "It sends a message that anyone who complies
with criminal orders under the Castro regime will be prosecuted,"
said Orlando Gutierrez, national secretary of the Cuban Democratic
Directorate. "Justice will be brought to those who commit crimes."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's 2002 report on human rights calls Cuba a
"totalitarian state" where the fundamental civil and political rights
of its inhabitants are systematically violated. Human rights
advocates and independent journalists, economists, doctors and
lawyers are harassed, arrested arbitrarily and imprisoned, and jail
conditions are so harsh that some prisoners are beaten by security
forces or prison officials, or die for lack of medical care, the
State Department said.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial in Miami federal court, witnesses described how
from 1968 to 1978, Mederos, accompanied by two burly assistants,
meted out electroshock treatments to patients at the notorious Havana
psychiatric hospital, many of whom were confined for opposing
Castro's rule.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like Dante's 'Inferno,' " was how one witness, former
Cuban political prisoner Nilo Jerez, described his three months in a
ward he said was completely under Mederos' control. Under the guise
of "electroshock therapy," witnesses said the nurse caused them to
suffer extreme pain, physical injury and loss of consciousness and
control over their bodily functions.</TE>
<TE>   In his defense, Mederos, now a frail, stooped figure, said he
delivered the electroshocks only when prescribed by doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no ability to make discretionary calls," defense attorney
David Rothman told the jury. "If he gave treatment to those to whom
it was prescribed, it wasn't torture. It was not given to them
because of their political beliefs." It was not clear whether Rothman
intended to appeal. He could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Mederos case has been an embarrassment to U.S. government
officials, who have said they cannot explain why citizenship was
granted to the Cuban immigrant in 1993, even though a year before he
had been publicly accused of torturing political prisoners. For
years, the man who was infamous in his homeland as El Enfermero (the
Nurse) lived freely in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   He was finally indicted and arrested last Sept. 4. after Miami's
two Cuban American members of the House of Representatives became
active in the case.</TE>
<TE>   According to U.S. officials, Mederos can be deported only if Cuba
chooses to accept him back. Assistant U.S. Atty. Frank Tamen, who
prosecuted the case, has said Cuba might let him return because he
once worked for the government.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Fast-Track Trade Bill</HD>
<DH>Politics: In a victory for the White House, the measure
limits Congress' authority to alter deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate approved legislation Thursday to expand the White House's
authority to negotiate trade pacts, handing President Bush a victory
on one of his key strategies for bolstering the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The 64-34 vote sent the measure to the president, who will sign it
into law soon. Under the bill, Congress would be permitted to approve
or reject but not modify trade deals worked out with other nations.</LD>
<LD>   The measure includes a Democratic-pushed expansion of federal
benefits for workers who lose their jobs because of foreign
competition.</LD>
<TE>   Bush called a group of Republican and Democratic senators after
the vote and praised them for making it "much more likely somebody is
going to be able to find work, and some farmer is going to be able to
sell his product, and some nation is going to be able to trade with
us, which will help lift them out of poverty."</TE>
<TE>   He also signaled his intention to have his administration exercise
to the fullest its new authority, known as "fast-track" negotiating
power. Bush joked that U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick
has "his running shoes on. He's going to hit the ground running to
bring us some good trade agreements."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the bill's passage is likely to jump-start global
and hemispheric trade negotiations because it gives trading partners
confidence that the U.S. administration can make deals that will
stick.</TE>
<TE>   "It removes a major obstacle to active U.S. leadership of the
global trade negotiations," said Jeffrey Schott, a trade specialist
at the Institute for International Economics. "We've always been
engaged, but our ability to lead the process had been impaired by
doubts" that Congress, pressured by constituents, would revise
agreements that lowered U.S. trade barriers.</TE>
<TE>   What the fast-track authority does is "recognize that trade is a
two-way street," Schott said. "If we are going to achieve the
benefits we want, we have to allow foreign markets to compete in our
markets."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the practical effect of the measure may not be seen for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Since trade-negotiating authority is merely a tool, not an end in
itself, the significance of this fast-track vote can only be judged
by what the administration ultimately accomplishes with it," said
Bruce Stokes, senior fellow in economic studies for the Council on
Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   Bush lobbied hard to gain the authority, traveling to Capitol Hill
on July 26 when the issue was before the House. He also stayed up
late that night to phone wavering lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The House, where concerns about the effect of trade on hometown
industries are more pronounced than in the Senate, approved the
legislation, 215 to 212.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the legislation will accelerate trends that cause
U.S. jobs to be lost to other countries where workers are paid less.
They also said the measure contains no assurance that foreign
countries would observe basic environmental and labor standards.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO's chief lobbyist told senators the bill would allow
"end-runs around congressional checks and balances on future trade
agreements at a time when the American people's trust in corporations
is so low."</TE>
<TE>   But the measure easily prevailed in the Senate, in part because of
concerns about the U.S. economy and the stock market turmoil. Its
passage was also helped by the provision to expand benefits, such as
retraining, for workers left jobless because of import deals.</TE>
<TE>   The bill will nearly triple the size of the benefits' fund, to
more than $10 billion over the next decade. Displaced workers will be
eligible for a tax credit to pay for 65% of health insurance costs.</TE>
<TE>   Voting for the bill were 43 Republicans, 20 Democrats and one
independent. California's two Democratic senators split on the bill,
with Dianne Feinstein voting for it and Barbara Boxer against it.</TE>
<TE>   "Trade has always been more popular in the Senate, reflecting the
importance of agricultural exports and their greater representation
in the Senate," said Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the
nonpartisan Brookings Institution. "And Bush conceded a lot of money
to the Senate Democrats" for the displaced workers' fund.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with President Ford, every president had some form of
fast-track authority. But Congress, which has granted the authority
for limited periods of time, refused to renew it for President
Clinton in 1994 after a bitter fight over the North American Free
Trade Agreement. The current legislation is for five years.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. farm subsidies and price supports, as well as textile
subsidies, are likely to be the first targets in future negotiations
on trade pacts. These talks are expected to include efforts by the
Bush administration to expand NAFTA from Mexico and Canada to include
all of North and South America, except Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Litan, director of economic studies for the Brookings
Institution, said difficult negotiations on treaties lie ahead.
"Passage of fast-track is just the opening pitch in a long-inning
ballgame," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the United States has taken a series of steps that
have caused other nations to wonder "how really committed we are to
further multilateral trade liberalization," such as new steel
tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's Senate debate, opponents of the legislation
contended that Congress was ceding too much authority to the
president.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who
helped craft the legislation, said, "We don't give the president a
blank check." He said the legislation lays out "negotiating
objectives" on issues such as worker rights and environmental
protection.</TE>
<TE>   But organized labor is particularly unhappy with a provision it
says will undermine worker and environmental protections in future
trade agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely see it as backward movement, which is so
frustrating," said Thea Lee, AFL-CIO assistant director for public
policy. "For a decade, we've been making slow and steady progress
toward putting enforceable workers' rights in the core of these
agreements."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the increased negotiating authority for Bush, the trade
measure will extend preferential tariff treatment for imports from
Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, whose governments are trying to
wean their economies away from cocaine production.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said the measure represents "the right balance,"
allowing Congress and the administration to work together to promote
trade while providing support for workers who might lose jobs because
of increased globalization.</TE>
<TE>   But Boxer said: "I do not believe I should give up the legislative
authority vested in the Congress by the Constitution. If Congress
gives up the ability to amend trade agreements, I would lose my
opportunity to fight for good jobs and help the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Among those supporting the bill was the California Wine Institute,
which said the legislation could reduce trade barriers in other
countries, such as high tariffs and distribution restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The bill will create opportunities for "greater market access for
California wine," said Bobby Koch, the institute's senior vice
president.</TE>

<HD>Activists Plead for Help on Beating Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Pleading with residents to "break the code of silence," community
leaders went door to door Thursday to find witnesses to the killing
of two men who were dragged from a van after an accident and beaten
by an angry mob.</LD>
<LD>   "So far the community has not responded," said Najee Ali, a civil
rights activist who helped organize the canvass. "They're still in a
state of shock. It's up to the community leaders to provide guidance,
to say it's OK to help law enforcement. It's time to break the code
of silence."</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, authorities on Thursday reported that the van's driver
was legally drunk.</LD>
<TE>   Anthony Stuckey, 49, and Jack Moore, 62, were in a rental van
Tuesday evening that hurtled over a curb and plowed into a group of
young people on a stoop in the blighted Oakland neighborhood on
Chicago's South Side, police said.</TE>
<TE>   As the injured lay on the ground, a mob pulled the two men from
the van and beat them to death with their hands, feet, bricks and
stones, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police had a suspect in custody, but no immediate charges were
filed. Police said they were talking to several other "persons of
interest." Supt. of Police Terry G. Hillard asked for help from the
public in finding anyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody's pretty repulsed. It was just a horrible
display of abuse," said Julia Mitchell, a 29-year-old neighborhood
resident. Police said they do not know what caused the van to veer
off the street.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cook County medical examiner reported Thursday that Moore
had a blood-alcohol level between 0.08 and 0.09, just above the legal
limit of 0.08. Stuckey had a level of 0.06, the medical examiner
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a simple, senseless, double homicide committed by a bunch
of cowardly thugs, and these murderers will be brought to justice,"
Hillard said.</TE>
<TE>   Zakiyyah S. Muhammad, who lives in the neighborhood, said people
there are wary of police and may hesitate to turn in friends.</TE>
<TE>   Three people struck by the van remained hospitalized, one in
critical condition, the others in fair condition.</TE>

<HD>Study Links Antisocial Behavior to Abuse, Variant Gene</HD>
<DH>Science: Mistreatment during childhood and low enzyme
activity may make men more violent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Men who were mistreated during childhood are more likely to become
criminals or exhibit other antisocial behavior if they have a single
gene variation that results in low activity of an important brain
enzyme, according to a study published today.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers studied 442 men who were part of a larger New Zealand
study that followed the men from their birth in 1972. Out of the
group, 154 were mistreated as children--a condition the researchers
defined as having been rejected by their mothers, physically or
sexually abused, or subjected to frequent changes in their primary
caregivers.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers found that 85% of the abused children who had the
gene variation were eventually involved in some form of antisocial
behavior as adults, including violent crime.</LD>
<TE>   But researchers cautioned that the gene variation cannot be used
to predict who will become violent. The study found that men who had
the low-activity form of the gene but were not abused as children
showed no increased risk of behavioral problems.</TE>
<TE>   Terrie Moffitt, one of the study's researchers and a professor of
psychiatry at King's College London and the University of Wisconsin,
said the two findings underscore the interaction between genes and
environment in influencing human behavior. "People shouldn't think
they have no choice of whether to be violent or not," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moffitt's research focused on a gene called monoamine oxidase A,
or MAOA. The gene controls the production of an enzyme that breaks
down neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine and
dopamine.</TE>
<TE>   There are several variations of the gene. The most common, found
in about two-thirds of the male population, is a high-activity
version that produces more of the MAOA enzyme. The low-activity
variation is found in about one-third of males.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have also identified a third variation that results in
the complete absence of the MAOA enzyme. It was found almost 10 years
ago in a Dutch family plagued by several violent members. This form
is extremely rare and hasn't been identified in any other families.</TE>
<TE>   The function of the MAOA enzyme is to clear neurotransmitters from
the brain's signaling system. Moffitt said no one knows specifically
how the enzyme affects behavior, but it may act as a reset button in
stressful situations, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that children who were abused and had the
low-activity gene were more than three times more likely to be
antisocial than their high-activity counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists evaluated adult behavior by looking at criminal
records, psychiatric evaluations and a personality questionnaire. The
research looked at men because women are much less likely to inherit
only the low-activity gene.</TE>
<TE>   Moffitt said the predictive ability of the low-activity gene for
antisocial behavior in abused children is far from certain.</TE>
<TE>   Moffitt emphasized that the study also found that having the
high-activity gene could be protective in children who have
experienced severely stressful situations. About 25% of children who
were abused but had the high-activity gene were eventually involved
in antisocial behavior, far lower than the approximately 50% rate for
abused children as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows why kids with the protective genotype are more
resistant to trauma," Moffitt said. But she added: "If genes have
been kept in the population for hundreds of years, they are probably
conferring an advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Laura Baker, an associate professor of psychology at USC,
commended the study as one of the first to pinpoint a gene that can
modify a person's vulnerability to environmental stresses.</TE>
<TE>   But Evan Balaban, director of the neurosciences program at City
University of New York, said the results of the study are hard to
interpret. They are missing many of the steps that link gene activity
with the behavior being studied, Balaban said.</TE>
<TE>   Balaban has criticized previous research on the biological basis
of violent behavior and said that many people classified as having
violent or aggressive characteristics were mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   He said this is also a possibility in this study: The low-activity
gene may be associated with mental illness, which can lead to more
inappropriate behavior in general.</TE>

<AU>MARLA BENNETT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The following is excerpted from an essay by Marla Bennett, one of the
five Americans killed Wednesday in the bombing of Hebrew University.
It originally appeared in the weekly San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage
on May 10.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Each morning when I leave my apartment building, I have an
important question to contemplate: Should I turn left or should I
turn right?</LD>
<TE>   This question may seem inconsequential, but the events of the past
few months in Israel have led me to believe that each small decision
I make--by which route to walk to school, whether to go out to
dinner--may have life-threatening consequences.</TE>
<TE>   I have been living in Israel for a year and a half; I arrived just
a month before the current wave of violence and horror began. And for
about that same period of time, I have been receiving calls each week
from various friends and family members who subtly, or less than
subtly, suggest I think about coming home. My friends and family talk
about how dangerous it is here, and I have to agree with them. It is
dangerous. But I remain unconvinced that the rest of the world is
such a safe place.</TE>
<TE>   At least if I am here I can take an active role in attempting to
put back together all that has broken. I can volunteer in the homes
of Israelis affected by terrorism, I can put food in collection
baskets for Palestinian families, I can see what goes on each day
with my own eyes instead of with the eyes of CNN. Beyond all of the
brutality, in most places in Israel life goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, I went to Prague for the weekend. One of the
perks of living in Israel is easy (and cheap!) travel to Europe, and
as the stress of living in Israel continued, my friend Amanda and I
decided to take a break for a few days. Indeed, it was a break: We
felt free to walk in large, crowded areas without looking over our
shoulders. We went to cafes and drank coffee without constantly
eyeing the door for anyone in bulky clothing, we used public
transportation without second-guessing our choice.</TE>
<TE>   But as we sat in shul on Friday night, an announcement was made
that a rally for the Palestinians was being held in a square nearby
and we should be careful to take a different route home. With the
rising anti-Semitic violence in Europe, no one was sure that the
night would end peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   Could we feel carefree anywhere?</TE>
<TE>   During Pesach this year, while terror attacks within Israel were a
nearly daily occurrence, an acquaintance [noted] that though she does
not always feel safe going to public places in Jerusalem, she still
feels safe to walk alone on the streets at 1 in the morning. I
question which way I will walk to school in the morning, but I too
feel secure walking the streets of Jerusalem alone at night--even the
small side streets I frequent now to avoid the popular thoroughfares.
I never felt safe enough to do that while I lived in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   My friends and family in San Diego are right when they call and
ask me to come home. It is dangerous here. I appreciate their
concern. But there is nowhere else in the world I would rather be
right now. I have a front-row seat for the history of the Jewish
people. I am a part of the struggle for Israel's survival. Paying for
my groceries is the same as contributing money to my favorite cause.
Since traveling to Prague and feeling the fear of the Prague
community as they faced possible violence, I know that this struggle
is worthwhile.</TE>

<HD>We Should Fight Fire With, Well, Fire</HD>
<DH>Prescribed burns were a good idea in 1920, and they still
are today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARLE</AU>
<BD>David Carle, author of "Burning Questions, America's
Fight With Nature's Fire" (Praeger, 2002), was a California state
park ranger for 27 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We are painstakingly building a firetrap that will piecemeal, but in
the long run completely, defeat the very aim of fire protection
itself. The only question that remains is whether, after accumulating
kindling by 20 years or so of 'protection,' we can now get rid of it
safely. In other words, if we try to burn it out now, will we not get
a destructive fire? We have caught the bear by the tail--can we let
it go?"</LD>
<LD>   Steward Edward White wrote those words for a 1920 article in
Sunset magazine. "Light burning" advocates, like White and other
lumbermen and ranchers in California, lost their battle with the
young Forest Service and, instead, a goal of total fire exclusion
became national policy. Inevitably, the "bear" that White warned
about became ever more dangerous and powerful.</LD>
<LD>   Wildfires in today's news are far bigger, far more destructive and
often impossible to defeat without the help of weather changes. With
increasing numbers of people living at the edge of wild lands, there
seems little choice but to muster armies of firefighters and
equipment, pay incredible costs and fight to protect lives and
property.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the 20th century, there were those who questioned the
nation's "hundred years war" against wildfire. It was not until the
1970s that national fire policy acknowledged fire's ecological
benefits. Harold Biswell of UC Berkeley's School of Forestry overcame
decades of professional opposition and became one leader of that
transition toward the reintroduction of fire. The national fire plan
that now guides policy recognizes the role of fire as an essential
ecological process and natural-change agent. That is validation for
the scientific findings and philosophical arguments of Biswell and
other prescribed-burning pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   Recent fuel reduction efforts are being supported with a
multibillion-dollar federal budget, but much of that money,
ironically, has gone to hiring firefighters and buying equipment.</TE>
<TE>   If we have truly turned the corner on wildfire policy, an expanded
effort at fuel reduction using prescribed burns and judicious
thinning will take advantage of that additional staff and equipment.
Wild-land firefighters ought to, increasingly, become year-round fire
technicians, able to properly conduct burns. Fire management plans
have been mandated; actually completing them must become a top
priority. Without plans in place, managers have little flexibility
and few options but to try to quickly extinguish even fires that
serve beneficial purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years ago, Biswell made farsighted predictions:</TE>
<TE>   "Wildfire damage and number of homes burned will become much
greater. Suppression costs will continue to skyrocket. Very slowly,
but eventually, emphasis on prescribed burning will replace that on
fire prevention and suppression.</TE>
<TE>   "When it does, fire suppression will become more effective and
much cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   "There will not be as much devastation from wildfires. However,
that seems many years off. There will be a greater awakening to the
fact that fire is natural and that we must use it for our own
survival. We must exercise great patience, and persistence."</TE>
<TE>   Fire management professionals should be honored when they return
blackened and exhausted from the wildfire wars, but we should also
celebrate when they come home after routine prescribed burns. On
those days, they are not warriors but peacemakers.</TE>
<TE>   In the long term, such routine tasks will be far more successful
at protecting property and lives. That attitude adjustment may be the
crucial step that lets us rejoin the long list of the nation's
fire-adapted species and achieve peaceful coexistence with nature's
fire.</TE>

<HD>Execs With a Twist: Paging Dr. Freud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Excerpted from Arianna Huffington's syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching the latest installments of Must CEO TV--disgraced corporate
execs carted off in handcuffs or robotically taking the 5th in front
of congressional committees--I found myself thinking that instead of
the usual talk-show pundits, it would be more useful to convene a
round-table discussion on the subject featuring Dr. Phil, Dr. Jung
and Dr. Freud. Call it "The Three Doctors." I'd love to hear what
these legendary explorers of the human psyche would make of the likes
of John Rigas, Dennis Kozlowski, Bernie Ebbers, Sam Waksal and those
Three Horsemen of the Enron Apocalypse--Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and
Andy Fastow. What led these men to do the despicable things they did?</LD>
<LD>   In "Without Conscience," renowned criminologist Robert Hare
identified the key emotional traits of psychopaths: the inability to
feel remorse, a grossly inflated view of oneself, a pronounced
indifference to the suffering of others and a pattern of deceitful
behavior.</LD>
<LD>   Could there be any better example of a person with a
grandiose--and sociopathic--sense of entitlement, of feeling that the
rules that mere mortals live by don't apply to him, than Adelphia's
Rigas? He thought nothing of "borrowing" $3.1 billion from his
shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   If you are looking for a poster boy for the inability to feel
regret or shame, Tyco's Kozlowski is definitely your man. Tyco
shareholders may be out $80 billion in market value, and he may be
facing trial as a notorious tax cheat, but "Deal-a-Day Dennis"
refused to let a few unfortunate details like these stop him from
hosting a lavish Fourth of July holiday bash that featured cases of
vintage wine and rides around Nantucket Harbor on his $25-million
yacht.</TE>
<TE>   And you'd be hard-pressed to find a man more willing to play fast
and loose with the truth than that indefatigable social climber, Sam
Waksal. He didn't just lie about big things, like the prospects of
FDA approval for his company's cancer drug Erbitux. He lied even when
there was nothing to gain, claiming he was 52 when he was 54 and that
he was raised in Toledo, Ohio, when he grew up in Dayton. Either way,
he's a middle-aged Middle American, so why the subterfuge?</TE>
<TE>   But before we get too comfortable pointing our fingers, we need to
admit that their antisocial behavior could not have flourished in a
vacuum. We allowed it. Even celebrated it. Like the klepto-CEOs, our
culture also suffered a severe empathy shortage during the
irrationally exuberant '90s.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, few seemed to care that, even at the height of the
bull market, we still had more than 14 million children living below
the poverty level. But who had time to notice, especially when
another hot new IPO was about to turn some twentysomething computer
geek into a dot-com billionaire?</TE>
<TE>   And just as Jeff Skilling, who abandoned the sinking Enron ship,
exhibits the psychopath's profound proclivity for denial--continuing
to insist that he "made the right decisions"--so too did our culture.
During the '90s, denial replaced baseball as the national pastime. We
buried our heads in the sand, unwilling to question the integrity of
the bulls rushing down Wall Street for fear it might jeopardize the
30% rate of return we had come to see as our birthright. And the
buoyant pronouncements of our political leaders only served to hammer
home the delusion that the party would go on forever.</TE>
<TE>   "Never has the promise of prosperity been so vivid," said
candidate George Bush in the days leading up to the 2000 election,
while his opponent, Al Gore, blithely hailed "the greatest prosperity
ever" and promised voters: "You ain't seen nothing yet." Just as our
culture at large has celebrated shallowness, so too did the corporate
culture. It started putting a premium on charismatic CEOs who looked
good on the cover of Forbes and Business Week.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out, of course, that far too many of these golden boys
were good on the tube but tended to overlook mundane little things
like where to list the assets on the balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Reckless grandiosity? Grotesque delusion? Sheer madness? Paging
Dr. Freud.</TE>

<HD>Where Is the Voice of Dissent?</HD>
<DH>As we weigh an attack on Iraq, we need someone like the
Vietnam era's Wayne Morse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORMAN SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>Norman Solomon is executive director of the Institute
for Public Accuracy. Web site address: www.accuracy.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As prominent senators consider the wisdom of making war on Iraq,
truly independent thinking seems to stop at the water's edge. But I
keep recalling a very different scene: On Feb. 27, 1968, I sat in a
small room on Capitol Hill. Around a long table, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee was in session, taking testimony from an
administration official. I remember a man with a push-broom mustache
and a voice like sandpaper, raspy and urgent.</LD>
<LD>   Wayne Morse, the senior senator from Oregon, did not resort to
euphemism. He spoke of the "tyranny that American boys are being
killed in South Vietnam to maintain in power." Moments before the
hearing adjourned, Morse said he did not "intend to put the blood of
this war on my hands."</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to imagine the late senator going along with claims
today that the U.S. government has a right to attack Iraq because of
the doctrine of "anticipatory self-defense."</LD>
<TE>   A fierce advocate of international law, Morse had no patience for
double standards. In 1964 he told a national TV audience: "I don't
know why we think, just because we're mighty, that we have the right
to try to substitute might for right. And that's the American policy
in Southeast Asia--just as unsound when we do it as when Russia does
it."</TE>
<TE>   Nor was Morse at all tolerant of pronouncements about the
necessity of saving face. He bristled at the kind of logic advanced
the other day by a top Pentagon advisor, James R. Schlesinger, who
asserted that "given all we have said as a leading world power about
the necessity of regime change in Iraq ... our credibility would be
badly damaged if that regime change did not take place."</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress are apt to focus on the efficacy of taking
military action, the hazards of getting bogged down, the need for a
clear exit strategy. But such discussions did not preoccupy Morse. He
directly challenged the morality--not just the "winnability"--of the
war in Vietnam. And from the outset he insisted that democracy
requires substantial public knowledge and real congressional
oversight rather than acquiescence to presidential manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing on the CBS program "Face the Nation," Morse objected
when journalist Peter Lisagor said, "Senator, the Constitution gives
to the president of the United States the sole responsibility for the
conduct of foreign policy." The senator responded sharply: "Couldn't
be more wrong. You couldn't make a more unsound legal statement than
the one you have just made. This is the promulgation of an old
fallacy that foreign policy belongs to the president of the United
States. That's nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   When Lisagor prodded him ("To whom does it belong then,
senator?"), Morse did not miss a beat: "It belongs to the American
people.... And I am pleading that the American people be given the
facts about foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   When his questioner persisted--"You know, senator, that the
American people cannot formulate and execute foreign policy"--Morse
became indignant. "Why do you say that?" he demanded. "I have
complete faith in the ability of the American people to follow the
facts if you'll give them. And my charge against my government is,
we're not giving the American people the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Today there are ample reasons for similar concerns.</TE>
<TE>   During the early years of the Vietnam War, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee functioned as a crucial venue for dissenting
perspectives, but in its current incarnation the panel is notably
less independent. The witness list for this week's hearings about
Iraq prompted Scott Ritter, an ex-Marine and former U.N. weapons
inspector in Iraq, to charge that Chairman Joseph Biden (D-Del.) and
most of the congressional leadership "have preordained a conclusion
that seeks to remove Saddam Hussein from power regardless of the
facts and are using these hearings to provide political cover for a
massive military attack on Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Transfixed with tactical issues, none of the senators on
television in recent days would dream of acknowledging the current
relevance of a statement made by Morse a third of a century ago:
"We're going to become guilty, in my judgment, of being the greatest
threat to the peace of the world. It's an ugly reality, and we
Americans don't like to face up to it."</TE>
<TE>   With war and peace hanging in the balance, I miss Wayne Morse. He
insisted on asking tough questions. He fully utilized a keen
intellect. And he spoke fearlessly from the heart without worrying
about the political consequences.</TE>

<LD>Summertime, and the living is anything but easy for many high school
students. Instead of lounging in sun-soaked deck chairs,
college-bound soon-to-be-seniors are hunching over computer screens,
grinding out self-serving essays and padding resumes. Months later,
they will be nervously staring at the screen again.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last few years, the Internet has allowed many colleges to
shave days off students' agonizing wait to hear whether a college has
accepted or rejected them.</LD>
<LD>   It's a good system, but ham-fisted hacking by Princeton University
recently revealed its vulnerability to two troubling trends: the
erosion of privacy in the Internet age and increasingly cutthroat
competition between universities.</LD>
<TE>   It seems that Princeton University Admissions Director Stephen E.
LeMenager used the birth dates and Social Security numbers of several
students who had applied to that Ivy League school to break into a
restricted Web page that archrival Yale University used to notify
students whether it had accepted them to the class of 2006.</TE>
<TE>   LeMenager maintains he was just testing the security of the site.
Yeah, right. More likely is that Princeton was staking out the
competition. LeMenager nosed around, for instance, to see what Yale
had decided on relatively high-profile applicants, including
President Bush's niece, whose acceptance was viewed four times in one
afternoon, and the grandson of a famous Notre Dame football coach.
Princeton could use such information to determine whether to sic its
high-pressure deal-closers on these coveted kids.</TE>
<TE>   College applicants reveal themselves with the understanding that
the information is only for the eyes of a select few in an admissions
office. LeMenager's actions breached that trust, and probably the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which is intended to
safeguard the student personal information so increasingly abundant
in cyberspace these days.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope the nation's universities respond to the Princeton
mini-scandal with another layer of security, like the special pass
codes in use at some schools. Either that or risk leaving
confidential information as fodder for a hackers' free-for-all.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell shook hands with North Korea's
foreign minister. They sipped coffee. Not much in most circumstances,
but for the secretive Stalinists of North Korea it amounted to a
blatant overture.</LD>
<LD>   Powell met with North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun on the
sidelines of a regional Asian summit on security in Brunei, and both
said later they hoped for meaningful talks. The most pressing issue
for the United States and countries in the region like Japan, China
and of course South Korea is to ensure that Pyongyang does not
develop nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea has sent mixed signals before, and this time--whether
by accident or design is hard to know--the country's Communist Party
newspaper demanded on the day of the Powell-Paek meeting that the
37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea leave. The newspaper also
labeled the United States "the aggressor and the kingpin of evil" and
said the Bush administration was "keen to make preemptive strikes"
after branding North Korea a part of the "axis of evil."</LD>
<TE>   Still, the Brunei meeting was the highest-level contact between
the United States and North Korea since the Clinton administration
left office. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang
in October 2000 when Washington was trying to negotiate an end to the
production and sale of North Korea's ballistic missiles. But
Pyongyang balked at attempts to verify and monitor compliance and
declined to make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has taken a far more wary stance.</TE>
<TE>   It has been eight years since the United States, Japan and South
Korea agreed to supply North Korea with two light-water nuclear
reactors for energy and North Korea agreed to end its nuclear
program. Since then, Pyongyang has test-fired a missile over Japan,
continued to export rockets to Iran and Pakistan and rebuffed many
South Korean attempts to improve relations. Those developments and
the suspicion that North Korea is continuing nuclear weapons
development have delayed construction of the new reactors, which is
due to start next week.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the North surprisingly issued a statement of regret for
its sinking of a South Korean naval patrol boat in June. That small
gesture by Pyongyang bolsters the international effort to persuade
North Korea--perennially on the verge of economic disaster and even
widespread starvation--that aid would flow generously if it stopped
nuclear weapons development and missile exports.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist regime hinted recently that it might undertake
economic reforms that include paying wages and letting prices of food
and other commodities rise to a level determined by supply and
demand. That would be a welcome start to ending its mummified
economic system.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea is unlikely to become stable or predictable anytime
soon. But the U.S. and its allies should keep dangling incentives to
lure it toward joining a more prosperous larger world.</TE>

<LD>On Tuesday the state Senate Judiciary Committee's seven members will
decide what to do about AB 1421, a vital but long-postponed bill that
outgoing Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis) has intrepidly pushed
since 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which would let judges order outpatient treatment for
seriously mentally ill people who can't fathom the gravity of their
condition, was named "Laura's law" last year, after a 19-year-old
killed by a man whose mental illness had been left untreated.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, similar preventable tragedies have occurred all too
often in states that lack outpatient commitment programs. In a Salt
Lake City courtroom last week, Michael Gall described how his brother
Lenny, after refusing to take medications to control his psychotic
delusions, killed their mother with an ax. Michael said his mother
had spent years seeking help for Lenny but had been told that he
could not be forced to take medications to control his delusions and
bipolar disorder.</LD>
<TE>   In a town near Austin, Texas, Linda Akin's family repeatedly tried
to find treatment for her schizophrenia before she took her mother's
life last month. "We'd talk to doctors," her father said, "and they
wouldn't put her in the state hospital because ... she wasn't making
threats."</TE>
<TE>   That same week, at a hearing in Portland, Kathryn Howard said
Oregon's civil commitment laws had contributed to her brother's fatal
shooting of their mother. "All of us in the courtroom feel like we're
watching a train wreck and there's nothing we can do," Howard said.
She recalled what happened to her schizophrenic brother when he was
taken to the hospital after threatening to kill their mother two
years ago. "The hospital could not keep him there because he did not
want to stay, even though the people at the hospital told us that he
was, indeed, dangerous.... They said, 'Just try to keep him away from
sharp objects.' "</TE>
<TE>   We support the efforts of lawmakers who, aware that the majority
of people with mental illness are no more dangerous than someone with
eczema, have repeatedly amended Thomson's bill to provide
comprehensive civil rights protections. But a lobby of advocates for
the rights of the mentally ill is intent on preserving a status quo
that we consider tragic. It is demanding that the bill restrict
eligibility for the new program to people who meet California's rigid
"5150 standard." That part of the state's Welfare and Institutions
Code allows involuntary treatment only for those who are in imminent
danger of harming themselves or others.</TE>
<TE>   Laura's law won't mean much unless it goes beyond helping "5150s"
and embraces others who are clearly sick, in need of help and unable
to make rational decisions concerning treatment.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Get Their RAVE Act Together</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For all the reasons outlined in your July 29 commentary,
"Ill-Informed Bill to Counter Ecstasy Use in Clubs Is Nothing to Rave
About," the U.S. Senate deserves our utmost support for proposing the
Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act. If it looks like a
duck, walks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it's probably time to
call the game warden.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed RAVE Act would hold landlords liable for allowing
housing to be used for drug transactions that create long-term
community problems. It allows prosecution of people who knowingly
open, lease, rent, use or maintain a place for the purpose of
manufacturing, distributing or using a controlled substance. The bill
would make it a federal crime to temporarily use a place for the
purpose of using marijuana or other drugs.</LD>
<LD>   With Ecstasy use among teenagers up 71% over the last three years,
doesn't it make sense to give law enforcement every tool it needs to
deal with this problem? The Drug Policy Alliance is not a trade group
representing landlords or businesspeople. Its real concern is
legalizing drugs.</LD>

<TE>   Thanks for running William McColl's criticisms of the RAVE Act.
This legislation was written by people wholly ignorant of raves. As a
result, it is counterproductive and may actually be responsible for
future deaths at raves, far more than would ever be seen resulting
from Ecstasy use.</TE>

<HD>Utilities Need a System to Energize the Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Power Plants Put on Hold" (July 30) makes me wonder what we are all
waiting for in the energy business. It seems clear from this article
and many others that the deregulated energy market does not work as
presently designed.</LD>
<LD>   So we have two choices: Step back to something more like the old
system or move forward into true deregulation of energy. We seem
stuck with one foot in the old system and one in the new. It seems
clear to me that we don't have the political grit to truly deregulate
and trust the marketplace to get our power supplies and prices right.
So why aren't we moving a step back to the old system? Why are we
still frozen in the headlights of deregulation?</LD>
<LD>   It is true that the old system cannot be fully restored. The
California Public Utilities Commission required the utilities to sell
off their power plants, and so those plants are gone. However, the
utilities could be ordered to build new plants to meet the new load
requirements under "cost of service" regulation (once we return them
to financial health). These utility plants would provide energy at
cost, and the non-utility-owned plants could continue to sell into
the market at the market price. We had a lot of this hybrid design in
the old system.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Navy's New Hornet Carries a Bigger Sting Than Predecessor," July
31: "Sting" is the perfect word to describe the F/A-18E Super Hornet.
At $57 million each, it is almost twice the $29-million price tag of
its predecessor. For this the Navy gets an extra 4 feet of airplane,
which can fly a mere 200 miles farther with only a 20% increase in
payload and thrust.</LD>
<LD>   Why does corporate greed upset the average American but not the
flagrant waste that continues to pour from the Department of Defense?
The older version of the Hornet can still fly circles around anything
else made in the rest of the world. What can possibly justify
spending $28 million more for each aircraft? This comes to a whopping
$140,000 for each additional mile this new Super Hornet can fly. Any
sting here is only on the American taxpayer.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Pick the Best Chief, Period" (editorial, July 29) says little about
what's needed at the LAPD but speaks volumes about your animus toward
the department and the 8,000-plus men and women who daily risk their
lives to keep you safe. In a poll conducted in January, 93% of
rank-and-file officers of the LAPD voted "no confidence" in Chief
Bernard Parks. You called that--and the resulting Police Protective
League campaign for a new chief--a hardball tactic. We call it
democracy in action.</LD>
<LD>   We think that all Los Angeles residents agree that we need safe
streets; we need a Police Department that operates in partnership
with our community; we need to cut crime; we need to continue reform;
and we need more officers to get our department up to full strength.</LD>
<LD>   You claimed that our members dread reform. The league has long
fought for, and continues to fight for, numerous departmental
reforms, with the full support of our members. No one wants a safer
and more secure Los Angeles than those of us who are out there every
day, around the clock, protecting the residents of our city. And we
will continue to work toward that end no matter what The Times says
about us.</LD>

<LD>I am sure The Times will receive many letters protesting the
publication of the photograph of the grossly impaled opossum
("Opossum Killings Test Limits of Cruelty Cases," July 29). I applaud
you for printing it, as it is a heinous reminder of the
unconscionable acts humans commit and attempt to justify. Perhaps the
viewing of that photograph will bring about changes in the law
permitting the killing of "injurious" animals "in any manner." There
should be no law ever that allows physical or emotional abuse of any
animal, human or otherwise. Legislators, please take note. Let's see
legislative action on this.</LD>

Now, according to Bush, whistle-blowers will be protected only when a
congressional investigation is already in progress. In other words,
an employee with damaging information cannot call a senator or the
media and be protected by the law.</TE>

<HD>Bankruptcy Bill Shifts Bad-Loan Responsibility</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for another timely column from Robert Scheer ("Another
Bankrupt Idea From Congress," Commentary, July 30). Just the day
before, I sat with my 77-year-old mother in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court
hearing room, hoping her petition to file Chapter 7 would be
approved.</LD>
<LD>   When our father passed away 13 years ago, our mother decided that
her role would be that of the beneficent grandmother. She bought
gifts for every birthday and holiday and, as the grandchildren got
older, repaired their cars and often paid their rent. This was all on
a tiny Social Security payment and a small income from a part-time
job. When she maxed-out one credit card, there was another bank
waiting eagerly to provide her with another. Eventually she had
incurred nearly $50,000 of credit card debt and didn't have enough
money left over every month to pay for the basic necessities of life.</LD>
<LD>   The banks themselves use arguments that ring of the tobacco
companies' vile plaints: We don't make people run up credit card
debt; we can't help it if they can't keep themselves from
overspending. What rot! Above all, these companies shouldn't ask the
government to bail them out of all the intemperate business decisions
they have made.</LD>
<TE>   By the way, Mom's petition was granted.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Wells</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer is right, Congress' actions are speaking louder than its
words. At nearly 30% interest, are the credit card companies not
making enough money? Maybe they should be more careful about whom
they extend credit to. Maybe they should start by not giving credit
cards to college students who have no income.</TE>
<TE>   Concerning Scheer's quote of Ezekiel 22:12, and so far as Congress
is concerned, you could shorten it substantially and it would be most
appropriate. Something like "Thou hast ... forgotten me, saith the
Lord God." Some of the harshest words that God has in the Bible are
for those who take advantage of widows and orphans. When will this
nation do what is right?</TE>
<TE>   Jim Allen</TE>
<TE>   Orange</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our legislators are working hard to make it more difficult for
individuals who file for bankruptcy, creating provisions that would
not dismiss debts as in past arrangements. I don't get it! Big
corporations go bankrupt, and those who have invested in them lose
everything. And how can a government that is deeply in debt, which is
essentially the same thing as being bankrupt, keep spending money it
doesn't have, whereas an individual cannot? Talk about hypocritical
unfairness!</TE>

<HD>Baby Boy Found Safe in Tijuana Inside Vehicle Stolen in San

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A 7-month-old boy who was in the back seat when his mother's SUV was
stolen Thursday was found hours later inside the vehicle in Tijuana,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The carjacker, described as a teenager, apparently was unaware
that Guillermo Cardena was in the Ford Expedition when he stole it
and crossed the border, officials said. Marilyn Cardena told police
she had left the baby in the SUV while delivering a package to a home
in San Ysidro, a San Diego neighborhood along the border.</LD>
<LD>   The state's new Amber Alert system was activated for the second
time--the first being earlier Thursday when two Antelope Valley
teenagers were kidnapped. It alerted drivers along freeways to watch
for the Ford Expedition.</LD>
<TE>   Just south of the border, a relative who had followed the SUV
rammed his car into the vehicle to try to rescue the child, officials
said. But in the confusion, the kidnapper got away. The carjacker was
at large Thursday evening.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Officers Face Jail in Assault</HD>
<DH>LAPD: The two plead no contest in an attack on a homeless
man. Critics say plea deal too lenient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former Los Angeles Police Department officers pleaded no contest
Thursday in Superior Court to assaulting a homeless man while on duty
in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   David Cochrane, 36, and Christopher Coppock, 30, each face up to
one year in County Jail and two additional years' probation when they
return to court for sentencing Nov. 13 before Los Angeles Superior
Court Judge Larry Fidler.</LD>
<LD>   The two former Central Division officers were charged with
terrorizing Delton Bowen by throwing him into their squad car and
taking him to the Los Angeles River, where he was allegedly
threatened with a handgun and thrown on the ground on Oct. 23, 1997.</LD>
<TE>   The pair were indicted in October 2000 on charges of kidnapping,
false imprisonment and assault by a public officer under color of
authority. The indictment also accused Cochrane of using a gun while
committing the offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Each man pleaded no contest to the assault charge. Under a plea
arrangement, the other two counts are to be dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   If the officers had been convicted of all charges, Cochrane could
have received up to 18 years in prison and Coppock faced a maximum of
nine years, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Kraig St. Pierre.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to possible jail time, the two still face a civil
rights suit filed by a person who claims he was framed by the
officers and then wrongly convicted.</TE>
<TE>   At least 17 defendants have had convictions overturned because
they were based on testimony or evidence provided by Cochrane and
Coppock, according to attorneys in the offices of the Los Angeles
County public defender and the alternate public defender.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this [plea arrangement] is unconscionable," said Gary
Wigodsky, a deputy alternate public defender who has represented some
of the freed defendants. "They should be in prison for a long time.
This is more proof the court and the district attorney's office allow
police corruption to flourish. Even when [officers] get caught, they
get off with sentences that shock the conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Cosper, head of the district attorney's Justice System
Integrity Division, said St. Pierre will argue strongly that the men
should serve jail time.</TE>
<TE>   Cosper and St. Pierre said the plea offer matched their reading of
the type of sentence Judge Fidler would be willing to accept.</TE>
<TE>   St. Pierre said, "The judge has already indicated this is not a
state prison case." Defendants sentenced to more than a year's
confinement are sent to state prison rather than County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically circumscribed our role," St. Pierre said. He said
Fidler suggested what he thought was an appropriate sentence "after
he heard testimony [in a court hearing] from our two key witnesses in
the case."</TE>
<TE>   One of them was former LAPD Officer Sandra Salazar, who was
working with Cochrane and Coppock when the incident occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The other key witness was the victim, Bowen.</TE>
<TE>   Cochrane and Coppock allegedly assaulted Bowen after he called one
of them a derogatory name, after which, prosecutors charged, he was
driven to the Los Angeles River and manhandled.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, Bowen has said he was handcuffed during the
beating and that one of the officers placed a cocked gun to his head
and kicked him down an embankment, where they left him.</TE>
<TE>   Coppock's attorney, Robert Rico, said his client accepted the deal
with prosecutors instead of going to trial partly because a jury
might be prejudiced against officers in the aftermath of the
Inglewood police beating case.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Inglewood police officer Jeremy J. Morse was caught
on videotape slamming 16-year-old Donovan Jackson onto a police car
and then punching him.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of the recent intense coverage of the Inglewood case and
the public comments about it by public officials, the offer was
something that my client felt was in his best interest," Rico said.</TE>
<TE>   After the incident with Bowen, Cochrane was fired from his LAPD
job and Coppock resigned.</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Discipline Proposed</HD>
<DH>Police: Chief recommends penalties for officers in case of
videotaped incident, but does not reveal them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inglewood Police Chief Ron Banks said Thursday he has recommended
administrative actions against officers in connection with the
videotaped beating of a 16-year-old boy, but he would not say how the
officers would be disciplined.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Jeremy Morse, who is seen on the videotape slamming the
handcuffed boy onto the trunk of a patrol car and punching him in the
face, would face either suspension or termination, according to
sources close to the case.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Bijan Darvish faces a short suspension; Officer Antoine
Crook faces minor discipline ranging from an oral reprimand to a
short suspension, and Officer Mariano Salcedo does not face any
administrative action, according to Corey Glave, attorney for all the
officers except Morse.</LD>
<TE>   "All the use of force has been justified for the three officers I
represent," Glave said Thursday. Witnesses in the internal
investigation confirmed, he said, that the teenager, Donovan Jackson,
had resisted officers at an Inglewood gas station July 6.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has said he obeyed all orders and did not provoke the
scuffle that ensued after sheriff's deputies investigated expired
registration tags on his father's car.</TE>
<TE>   The administrative discipline is separate from the criminal case
against Morse and Darvish. Morse was indicted by the Los Angeles
County Grand Jury on a charge of assault under the color of
authority, and Darvish was indicted on a charge of filing a false
police report for allegedly lying about the trunk slam. Each could
serve three years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo and Crook were given immunity from prosecution in exchange
for their testimony before the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   The internal police investigation concluded that Darvish did not
see how his partner placed Donovan Jackson on the patrol car, and
therefore did not lie in his police report, said Darvish's criminal
defense attorney, Ron Brower.</TE>
<TE>   Brower said he was "gratified to see" that the Police Department
had reached a different conclusion from that of the district
attorney's office on Darvish's police report.</TE>
<TE>   "My client will be pleased to return to the Police Department," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Activists have called on Banks to fire all of the officers
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Banks said that he has concluded the investigation and that the
officers had been informed of the results. State law, he said,
prohibited him from disclosing the details of their discipline.</TE>
<TE>   The officers can accept the chief's recommendations or appear at
an administrative hearing within two weeks, when they will have a
chance to present their case to Banks directly. Banks would then make
his final decision.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said his department acted with unprecedented speed by
finishing the inquiry in three weeks. He said he hopes that the
public will "understand that there is no perfect solution, and that
they will look upon it as a fair and just decision, taking into
consideration the interest of the public and the interest of the
officers."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the incident, Banks had said he was "concerned and
disappointed" by the images on the videotape.</TE>

<HD>$400,000 Settles Bias Case</HD>
<DH>Housing: Landlords are held accountable for a manager's
alleged demands and are accused of discrimination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owners of two apartment complexes in Riverside have agreed to pay
penalties of nearly $400,000 to settle allegations that they
discriminated against Latinos and African Americans and employed a
manager who demanded sexual favors from female tenants, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement is the result of a lawsuit filed by the U.S.
Department of Justice in April 2001 against the owners and manager of
the 31-unit Rio Palmas and the 70-unit Las Casitas complexes.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit accused the owners, William David Wingo and Karen
Wingo Cipriano, and their manager, Vincent Stancyk, of violating the
Fair Housing Act by discriminating against minorities and women.</LD>
<TE>   "This was an egregious case that required strong remedies,"
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. Ralph F. Boyd Jr. said in a prepared
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement makes clear that individuals who engage in
unlawful housing discrimination, and the people who employ them, will
be held accountable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wingo, Cipriano and their attorneys could not be reached for
comment Thursday afternoon. Wingo and Cipriano no longer own the Rio
Palmas complex, and no one answered the telephone at the front office
of the Las Casitas complex.</TE>
<TE>   Stancyk's attorney, Robert Walker of Riverside, said his client
"categorically denies" the allegations. Walker suggested that the
residents who prompted the lawsuit had been motivated by the prospect
of winning money. He said the case had been settled to avoid the
"cost and uncertainty of trial."</TE>
<TE>   "When you have the might of the United States focusing in on you,
settlement sometimes seems reasonable," Walker said. "He is trying to
move on. He was severely wounded by these allegations, and he is
trying to live his life in a positive way."</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, federal investigators determined that
Stancyk had subjected women at the apartment complexes to repeated
sexual harassment. At times, officials allege, he gave female tenants
privileges only after they performed sexual acts. Wingo and Cipriano
knew, or should have known, about the harassment and did nothing,
officials allege.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department investigators also found that they had
repeatedly discriminated against Latino and African American tenants.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, Wingo, Cipriano and Stancyk had
refused to rent to minority group members, had evicted them and
thrown away their rental applications, had used racial epithets, and
would not allow minority guests.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Wingo and Cipriano will pay $355,000 to
people who were discriminated against and a $35,000 civil penalty to
the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Stancyk is barred from working in the rental real estate business.</TE>

between La Paz Road and Oso Parkway. Three people in the SUV were
ejected. They were taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center;
one sustained major head injuries. The Jaguar's driver was not hurt.</CP>

<HD>CHP Faces Claim After Fatal Crash</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Family of a teen who was killed in a collision with
a squad car alleges officers were driving recklessly during an
alleged pursuit of another motorist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California Highway Patrol officer who was allegedly pursuing a
motorist when his cruiser struck another car and killed an Oxnard
teenager in March was driving recklessly and failed to activate his
siren and flashing lights, according to a legal claim filed by the
victim's family.</LD>
<LD>   The crash killed 18-year-old Jessica Ann Mohorko, a Hueneme High
School senior and preacher's daughter who had just attended a school
ball with her boyfriend, Christopher Haynes.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Jake Raughton, 36, and his wife and partner, Officer
Christina Raughton, 32, maintain they were chasing a suspected drunk
driver when their patrol car collided with Haynes' car on Oxnard
Boulevard, just south of Gonzales Road.</LD>
<TE>   "The officers affirmatively engaged in a course of conduct which
created, contributed to, or increased the risk of danger to others on
the highway, including Christopher and Jessica ... ," according to
the claim filed by Mohorko's family on July 17.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, 18, and the officers sustained minor injuries in the March
23 crash. Christina Raughton has since returned to work but her
husband, according to their attorney, has been significantly
traumatized and remains on leave.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a police officer's worst nightmare," said R. Rex Parris,
the Raughtons' Lancaster-based attorney. "Their car collides with the
people they are trying to protect. They're devastated."</TE>
<TE>   The 18-page claim, which is a required precursor before filing a
lawsuit, accuses the Raughtons, the CHP, Ventura County, the city of
Oxnard and the state Department of Transportation of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   It does not specify the amount of monetary damages the family is
seeking but includes a claim of emotional distress by family members
who say Jessica--who was killed instantly--was left inside the
wreckage for six hours while authorities investigated the crash.</TE>
<TE>   According to the claim filed by Andrew Dawson, the Mohorko's
Woodland Hills-based attorney, the officers were not in "immediate
pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law" and had not
notified CHP dispatchers of any active pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the officers were driving at an "unsafe and high rate
of speed," according to the claim, and they failed to turn on the
cruiser's red lights to warn other drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, according to Parris, the Raughtons' attorney. The officers
spotted a 41-year-old Oxnard man driving erratically and then watched
as he ran a red light in front of them at Oxnard Boulevard and
Vineyard Avenue, Parris said.</TE>
<TE>   In the approximately two miles between where the man ran the red
light and the scene of the crash, Jack Raughton pursued the suspect
at speeds over the posted 45 mph speed limit and used the patrol
car's lights and siren when necessary, Parris said.</TE>
<TE>   Highway patrol officers are required by policy to turn off their
red lights and siren when passing motorists to the right, even during
a pursuit, Parris said. This occurred during the chase, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Parris maintains the patrol car's red lights were on when the
crash occurred, as well as flashing blue and yellow lights in the
unit's rear window. The alleged erratic driver has signed a
declaration saying he was at the crash scene, Parris said.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire pursuit took less than two minutes and they didn't
have time to notify dispatch, which, by policy, they don't have to do
until the violator starts to evade them," Parris said. "These
officers were doing everything they were supposed to be doing."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the crash, which occurred shortly after midnight,
Haynes was attempting a U-turn on Oxnard Boulevard to reach the
parking lot of a Denny's restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The patrol car, which was headed south on Oxnard Boulevard,
broadsided Haynes' car and killed Mohorko. Parris maintains that at
the time of the crash, Haynes was running an hour late for work at
the Denny's restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "Young people are often less attentive when they are in a hurry,"
Parris said. "What you've got here is two circumstances--an apparent
drunk driver and a young man late for work--that came together and
resulted in something horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Dawson declined to comment, except to say "the claim speaks for
itself."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the allegation of recklessness, the claim states
Haynes was wrongfully arrested at the scene and later forced to give
a blood sample against his will. Haynes, who is black, also claims he
was harassed and intimidated by officers investigating the case.
Dawson said a federal civil rights lawsuit remains a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's legal claim also criticizes the CHP for allowing married
couples to partner up and work together, describing it as "negligent
supervision and training."</TE>
<TE>   Further, the claim alleges that the left turn lane where Haynes
was turning did not have traffic control signals and was "obscured by
trees and signage" that blocked the view of southbound motorists.</TE>
<TE>   The claim alleges officials were aware of the hazards and
dangerous road conditions at the site because of previous crashes and
that they should have reconstructed the area to make it safer.</TE>
<TE>   Details and conclusions about the crash are contained in a
recently completed CHP report compiled by a special investigative
team in San Luis Obispo. That report will not be released publicly
for about a month.</TE>

<HD>Court Overturns Death Penalty in '80 Murder</HD>
<DH>Appeals: Killer's rights were violated when prosecutor told
the jury to ignore his religious conversion, panel rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sharply divided federal appeals court Thursday overturned the death
sentence of an Orange County man who was convicted in 1981 of the
rape and murder of a Garden Grove woman.</LD>
<LD>   The murder conviction of William C. Payton was upheld. But
appellate judges said his constitutional rights were violated when
the prosecutor at his trial told jurors deciding whether he should be
executed to ignore evidence that he had become a devout Christian
behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   That, the court ruled, violated his constitutional rights. It said
he should be given a new sentencing trial or have his sentence
reduced to life in prison without possibility of parole.</LD>
<TE>   The decision was the 10th since November in which the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals has either reversed a death sentence or upheld the
decision of a federal trial judge who had overturned a death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of those rulings came in California cases, the 10th from
Washington, which is also part of the nine-state region within the
9th Circuit's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Dane Gillette, who heads the California attorney general's death
penalty unit, said the state has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to
review five of the reversals and is likely to ask the high court to
review Thursday's, as well.</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, the 9th Circuit affirmed on a 6-5 vote a 1999
ruling by U.S. District Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles in the case
of Payton, now 47.</TE>
<TE>   Real's decision had been reversed 2 to 1 by a smaller panel of 9th
Circuit judges last year. In December, the full court voted to rehear
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling means that Orange County officials will have to
reduce Payton's sentence or grant him a new sentencing trial unless
the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the circuit ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Payton's lawyer, federal public defender Dean R. Gits, argued
successfully that his client's constitutional rights were violated
when a prosecutor told a jury to ignore evidence that Payton had
become a devout Christian and taught a Bible study class while
incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   California's capital punishment law instructs jurors to consider a
variety of factors in assessing whether to impose death after a
murder conviction.</TE>
<TE>   The last element--known as "factor k"--is a catch-all that tells
the jury to consider any circumstance that "extenuates the gravity of
the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."</TE>
<TE>   The constitutionality of that language was upheld by the U.S.
Supreme Court in another case in 1990, but that ruling did not
address whether "factor k" applied to post-crime evidence of
rehabilitation, nor did it address the effect on a jury if a
prosecutor said such evidence could not be considered.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's decision, written by Judge Richard A. Paez, said the
prosecutor's statement that the evidence was not "really applicable"
and the judge's failure to clarify the issue for the jury denied
Payton a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It is reasonably likely" that the trial judge's "failure to
correct the prosecutor's misstatements ... caused the jury to
disregard relevant mitigating evidence and that this error was not
harmless," Paez wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He relied on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions to support his
opinion. The first was a 1982 ruling that said a state may not,
during the penalty phase of a capital case, preclude the jury from
considering any mitigating circumstance.</TE>
<TE>   The second was a 1986 decision that said post-crime good behavior
must be considered as mitigating evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Richard C. Tallman wrote a sharp dissent, suggesting that
the 9th Circuit "has lost its conscience and no longer listens to the
silent screams of the victims, who also are entitled to justice." He
said he did not believe that the prosecutor's statements misled the
jury and that if they did, they were "surely harmless."</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, there might be substantial doubt concerning Payton's
sincerity, given the timing of his religious conversion, but even if
the commitment were sincere, the jury may very well have concluded
that such matters concerned Payton's soul, not his life," Tallman
said. "It is true that in death penalty cases we ask for a higher
standard to affirm the sentence, but that does not mean that a trial
must be error-free."</TE>
<TE>   On May 26, 1980, Payton raped and killed Pamela Montgomery,
stabbing her with a butcher's knife a dozen times. He also stabbed
Patricia Pensinger 40 times in her face, neck, back and chest and her
10-year-old son, Blaine, 23 times in the face, neck and back. The
Pensingers survived the attacks, which occurred in a boardinghouse
where Payton once lived.</TE>
<TE>   The defense presented eight witnesses during the penalty phase of
the trial, including Payton's pastor, a deputy sheriff, four inmates,
his mother and the director of a religious organization ministering
to prisoners. "Their testimony, taken as a whole, tended to show that
Payton had been 'born again,' made a sincere commitment to God and
was performing good works in jail," Paez wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The pastor and the inmates all said they believed that Payton's
religious conversion was sincere, and a deputy sheriff said the
prisoner led prayer meetings and had a positive influence on other
inmates. Payton's post-crime conversion was the only mitigating
evidence offered by the defense.</TE>
<TE>   During closing arguments, however, the prosecutor said the
convict's conversion to Christianity and good conduct in prison
should be ignored because they occurred "well after the act of the
crime."</TE>
<TE>   Payton's defense lawyer moved for a mistrial, saying that the
prosecutor's comments were "completely contrary" to what the lawyers
and the judge had agreed to previously.</TE>
<TE>   The judge responded that what both attorneys said was "fair
comment" but offered no clarification. The jury returned a death
verdict, which was upheld by the California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Public defender Gits said he was pleased with the outcome. But
Gillette of the attorney general's office said he was very troubled
by the ruling. He said that, given the nature of the crimes, it was
"incredible" for the majority to conclude that the jury would have
declined to mete out a death sentence even if they believed in the
sincerity of Payton's conversion.</TE>

<HD>Signature Exhibit at Reagan Library</HD>
<DH>History: Rare 1823 Declaration will be unveiled today. It
will be the cornerstone of a hall dedicated to presidency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to the generosity of the co-founder of In-N-Out Burger, the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum near Simi Valley today
will unveil its newest permanent exhibit: a rare, 1823 parchment copy
of the Declaration of Independence.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an extraordinary historical document," said library
director Duke Blackwood, who will unveil the Declaration during a
public ceremony at 11:30 a.m. "We always refer to this as the birth
certificate of the United States."</LD>
<LD>   It was on this date in 1776 that John Hancock became the first
person to sign this version of the Declaration. It is the most
commonly seen reproduction and the one the public relates to most
because, unlike those printed on July 4, 1776, it carries the
signatures of 56 delegates to the Continental Congress, Blackwood
said.</LD>
<TE>   In 1820, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams commissioned William
J. Stone of Washington to create the copies because the signed
Declaration was rapidly deteriorating. It took Stone three years to
engrave the copper plate. From it, 201 parchment copies were made and
distributed to surviving signers of the Declaration, government
officials and various universities. Of those, 30 are known to exist
today, Blackwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Snyder, president of In-N-Out Burger, donated her copy to
the library in memory of her husband, Harry, and the couple's sons,
Rich and Guy.</TE>
<TE>   Harry and Esther Snyder founded In-N-Out Burger in Baldwin Park in
1948. Harry Snyder died of cancer in 1976, Rich died in a plane crash
in 1993 and Guy died of a drug overdose in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwood said Esther Snyder offered the document to the library
when she heard that a 1776 copy of the Declaration, which was on
temporary exhibit last year, would be leaving in January. Also,
Blackwood said, the Snyder family was particularly fond of Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, asserting
that "all men are created equal," to explain why the colonies had
declared their independence from England on July 2, 1776. The
Continental Congress adopted Jefferson's declaration on July 4, 1776,
with New York the only holdout among the 13 colonies.</TE>
<TE>   "This had never been done before in the world, saying we are going
to govern ourselves," Blackwood said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a declaration of war. It's basically them thumbing their
noses at King George."</TE>
<TE>   After New York finally agreed to the Declaration on July 9,
Congress ordered that it be written formally in large, clear letters
and signed by every member, according to the National Archives. Only
a few delegates refused. That original Declaration is in the National
Archives in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Stone copies are easier to read than the original, largely
because the wet-ink transfer process the engraver used removed much
of the ink from the original, Blackwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwood also hopes to acquire copies of the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights, and display together the three documents that form
the basis for America's democracy. Blackwood plans to travel to New
York next week in an effort to obtain a 1789 copy of the
Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The Declaration is behind glass, and the temperature and humidity
around it are regulated for optimal preservation, Blackwood said. The
lighting is dim so as not to fade it.</TE>
<TE>   The Declaration is the cornerstone of the Gallery of Presidents, a
new hall dedicated to the history of the country and presidency.</TE>
<TE>   The walls are decorated with portraits of each president, which
are reproductions from the White House Historical Assn. collection.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwood said the Declaration is part of the library's effort to
fill schools' needs.</TE>
<TE>   He said the 1776 copy of the Declaration and the rest of the
Freedom's Journey exhibit last year were so popular that the library
began opening early for schools and double-booking field trips. An
earlier exhibit of an 1848 copy of the Declaration on rice paper was
also successful, Blackwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Sargent, a history teacher at Foothill Technology High School
in Ventura, said it's hard to get teenagers excited about a document.
But along with stories about the founding fathers, he said, the copy
could help make a trip to the library worthwhile, particularly during
this period of renewed patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good spark to get people going," Sargent said.</TE>

<HD>For Some, County Fair Is a Smash</HD>
<DH>Autos: At the demolition derby, it's survival of the
quickest. Of course, having an old monster Oldsmobile helps too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For most of the drivers in the Ventura County Fair's annual
demolition derby, preparation begins months in advance. The first
step is finding a car that can withstand--and inflict--severe
punishment. Geo Metros and Honda Civics need not apply.</LD>
<LD>   "They try to find the biggest, strongest, baddest chassis they
can," said Cliff Morgan, director of competition for Ventura Raceway,
which operates the auto races and demolition derby on the first two
nights of the fair each year.</LD>
<LD>   That means steel monsters from the 1970s and '80s, especially
Oldsmobiles.</LD>
<TE>   "These things are just sheet metal," said 37-year-old Matt Thomas,
whose No. 3 car was a 1985 Oldsmobile Toronado with front-wheel
drive.</TE>
<TE>   The derbies are among the most popular events at the track,
drawing standing-room-only crowds waiting to see which automotive
gladiator will be left when the carnage ends.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers rarely pay more than $300 for a good body, and the fee to
enter the contest is just $50.</TE>
<TE>   First-time driver Larry Ayala of Oxnard got his No. 69, a 1973
Pontiac, for free from a friend and put about $100 into it. "It's a
big boat," the 37-year-old Ayala said.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers strip them, reinforce the bumpers, chain down the hoods
and weld the doors shut. They also make numerous modifications for
safety.</TE>
<TE>   Each car is equipped with a fire extinguisher and reinforcing door
bars. All glass and shattering plastics are removed, and the driver's
door panel gets extra padding. Windshields are replaced by mesh
screens or chain-link fence segments. The cars are fueled by a
two-gallon tank inside the body, which also houses the battery.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers must wear racing helmets, seat belts and fire suits.</TE>
<TE>   "Knock on wood, we've never had anybody hurt really bad," Morgan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers themselves have certain characteristics. Many have jobs
with body shops or towing services, the better to spot weaknesses or
find salvageable junkers. They toss around phrases like "my buddy's
junkyard" and thrive on the adrenaline rush they get from hitting and
being hit by multi-ton steel hulks.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be crazy," Thomas said. "I just think it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   Some drivers come back for punishment year after year. Mike
Stanford, better known as "Derby Mike," won in 2001 and returned to
defend his title Wednesday in his fifth consecutive competition.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad actually put together the first destruction derby in
Ventura County," Stanford said. "The very first one I did I was very
nervous. [But] after the first couple bangs, it's all fun."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't plan to enter this year, but at the last minute he found
a 1972 Ford station wagon that looked like it could hold its own.
Getting the car ready "really brings the family together," Stanford
said. "They love to get in there and get dirty. My wife and three
daughters were in charge of paint."</TE>
<TE>   Which could explain why, amid a fleet of flame-painted monsters,
Stanford's No. 4 car sported a lavender hue.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, some cars had inspirational slogans scrawled on what was
left of the dashboard, while other drivers had posted pictures of
loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   The rules are simple: Smash into everyone while trying to protect
your own car. Two minutes idling and you are out. The last car moving
wins.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can keep your radiator intact, you're in good shape,"
Stanford said.</TE>
<TE>   Different drivers have different strategies. Some like to take out
the bigger cars while letting the smaller ones fail on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Others aim for the front tires and fender to cripple their
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to build a good car and avoid any big hits by big cars,"
said past champion Eric Griffin, who drove the black "XX" car, a 1975
Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the excitement of the event--aided by both roars from
the stands and taped roars--takes over and drivers don't even notice
if they take a big hit, Stanford said. But a review of the dents and
destruction gives a synopsis of the race.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kind of like, 'I wonder when that happened,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just before 10 p.m. Wednesday, the rumbling pack was ready to take
to the arena. The ground had been made soggy and muddy to cut down on
traction and speed. Divided into two rows, the cars faced away from
one another until the start horn was blown.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers then threw their cars into reverse and started slamming.
On the first volley, one sheared the trunk off a slightly smaller
competitor.</TE>
<TE>   As the mayhem continued for 20 minutes, panels ripped apart and
padding flew onto the field. Steam spewed from the engines of
disabled cars as the field narrowed one by one.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford spent a few minutes attached bumper to bumper to a car
sponsored by the History Channel.</TE>
<TE>   He came loose with a helpful blow from Griffin, who later swung
around and nailed the History Channel car so hard that the right rear
tire--and axle--flew off.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, after a few more well-placed hits, Griffin emerged
victorious, and the "XX" took a victory lap around the broken hulks
of the losers.</TE>
<TE>   "You put a few more hours into the car and it pays off," said a
beaming Griffin after the race. "I was able to go where I wanted,
when I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Although Griffin claimed the $850 first prize, everyone was
eligible to patch up their cars and participate in the second derby
the next night.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost immediately they'll start cutting and welding," Morgan
said.</TE>
<TE>   If a car is too mangled, it goes to the junk heap. "Getting 'em
back on the trailer to go home is the hard part," Stanford said.</TE>

<HD>Court Curbs Detention of Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Incarceration: U.S. cannot indefinitely hold criminals
never formally admitted to the country, an appeals panel rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government cannot indefinitely imprison immigrants who
never have been formally admitted to the country, a federal appeals
court in San Francisco ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision could affect thousands of individuals, said Judith
Rabinovitz of the immigrants rights project at the American Civil
Liberties Union.</LD>
<LD>   When noncitizens commit crimes--including illegal entry into the
United States--the federal government's standard policy is to send
them back. But when their native countries will not take them--the
situation with Cuba, Cambodia and some former Soviet republics, for
example--the government has tried to hold immigrant criminals
indefinitely.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court said the government could not
hold immigrants who had committed crimes in the United States for
more than six months after the completion of their prison sentences.
The only exception, the court said, could be made if officials could
demonstrate that an immigrant's native country was likely to take him
back soon.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling flowed from that Supreme Court decision, appeals
court Judge M. Margaret McKeown said in her opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the previous cases, which involved criminals who had been
residents of the United States, Thursday's decision involved a man
who had never formally been admitted to the country. Lin Guo Xi, a
citizen of China, fled his homeland in 1997. The U.S. Coast Guard
apprehended him off the coast of Guam on a boat being used to smuggle
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Lin pleaded guilty to attempted illegal entry and served six
months in prison. He then sought asylum in the United States, saying
that he would face persecution at home because of his opposition to
China's laws limiting a family to one child. An immigration judge
turned him down and ordered his removal from the country.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Lin was transferred from a detention facility in Guam to
one near Seattle. But Chinese officials so far have not responded to
U.S. requests to issue travel documents to allow his return to their
country.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials and an immigration judge ordered that Lin be kept in
custody while waiting for a response from Chinese officials.</TE>
<TE>   Lin went to court asking for an order that he be let out of jail
while waiting for the travel documents. A federal district judge in
Seattle turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   But the appeals court sided with Lin, saying that he was entitled
to supervised release unless the government could show that it is
"reasonably foreseeable" that he can return to China.</TE>
<TE>   The key legal issue in the case centered on the government's
contention that individuals who had never formally been admitted to
the United States have fewer rights than those who have been admitted
but are facing deportation.</TE>
<TE>   As a general rule, immigrants who have not been admitted to the
country do have fewer rights. In this case, however, the law that
deals with the removal of illegal immigrants "does not draw any
distinction" between the two groups, McKeown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Ronald M. Gould joined in the opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The judges noted that the case did not involve "any national
security or other special circumstances where special arguments might
be made for forms of preventive detention."</TE>
<TE>   The majority said its ruling did not mean that Lin had to be
released immediately. If Lin can present evidence that there is "no
significant likelihood of removal [return to China] in the reasonably
foreseeable future," the government must release him unless officials
can "respond with evidence" that would rebut his case, McKeown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Pamela A. Rymer dissented, saying that the ruling
"judicially mandates a dramatic shift in immigration policy."</TE>
<TE>   "Aliens who have entered this country have constitutional rights
that aliens who have not entered do not," Rymer wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court decision in last year's case specifically noted
that "aliens who have not yet gained initial admission to this
country would present a very different question" from other
immigrants, Rymer wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Hillyer, the chief federal defender in Seattle, whose
office represented Lin, said that he was pleased with the ruling and
that, if it stands, Lin's lawyers will go back into court and argue
that he should be released because China will not take him back.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department had no immediate comment but is expected to
appeal.</TE>

Young Lives</HD>
<DH>Learning: A summer medical-careers program lets them shadow
pediatricians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jing Peng's jaw hangs expectantly as the needle pierces skin.</LD>
<LD>   She stands a safe distance away--10 feet--but occasionally she
can't resist. She leans closer. She grimaces. She raises her eyebrows
for a moment, all-too-familiar with the needle's prick.</LD>
<LD>   Peng is watching an epidural, a procedure that eases the pain of
childbirth.</LD>
<TE>   Today, more than 50 high school students complete the monthlong
Gene Black Summer Medical Careers Program, which has allowed them to
shadow local pediatricians.</TE>
<TE>   They have put on scrubs and lab coats, seen patients, witnessed
surgeries and other less-glamorous facets of a doctor's life, all in
the hope that one day they will be the ones holding the needles,
stethoscopes and scalpels.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the premed students don't have this type of shadowing
experience," said Dr. Jim Seidel.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its 33rd year, the program has mentored more than 1,500
students. The Los Angeles Pediatric Society provides dozens of
volunteer doctors and pays the program's bills.</TE>
<TE>   The society selects students from hundreds of applicants based on
their interest in medicine, grades and a personal essay.</TE>
<TE>   It recently received a $5,000 grant to help expand the program,
which was renamed after the death of Gene Black, a fluid engineer who
coordinated the program for its first 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   Many students, like Peng, have a specific interest in medicine.
Hers is cranial facial surgery, a form of plastic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But Peng isn't thinking about collagen, botox or face lifts.</TE>
<TE>   She was born 17 years ago in Guangzhou, China, with a cleft
palate. A surgeon repaired the cleft, but used outdated techniques
that left her face badly scarred.When her family moved to the United
States in 1993, Peng's mother took her to Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles, where a plastic surgeon reconstructed her nose. She still
has a scar, but it is less noticeable.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Peng got a peek at what she hopes is her future.</TE>
<TE>   Her mentor, Santa Monica pediatrician Dr. Robert Hamilton, sent
her to observe doctors who treat children with cleft palates.</TE>
<TE>   She saw the children and she cried.</TE>
<TE>   While researching her final paper, Peng came across several groups
that recruit doctors to go to poor countries and treat cleft palate
cases. She said she wants to join at least one such group.</TE>
<TE>   In Hamilton's office, Peng's ambition is not uncommon. The doctor
often travels to Africa and Latin America to treat children.</TE>
<TE>   During his second week in Hamilton's office, Eric Broussard
watched surgeons repair hernias on two toddlers. He walked out in
awe, he said later.</TE>
<TE>   But like all the students, afterward he was able to explain the
procedure in detail. Though the program stops short of offering
hands-on experience, each student is briefed by doctors before and
after any patient visit they witness.</TE>
<TE>   "They ask the tough questions," Dr. Chip Miller said. "But they
get to witness the delivery end of medicine, so it's not just them
staring at a textbook."</TE>
<TE>   Medical school--reading texts--is where Broussard expects to spend
the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   In a couple weeks, he will leave Los Angeles to attend classes at
Xavier University in Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   By his third day in Hamilton's office, Broussard's mind was set.
He didn't want to study pediatrics for one reason: screaming babies.</TE>
<TE>   As the students wrapped up their sessions this week, Gene Black
alumna Megan Morsheimer drove back to Los Angeles to start medical
school at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   She spent the summer of 1997 with Seidel in Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center's pediatric ward. At first, she saw medicine as a way to
continue volunteer work.</TE>
<TE>   One day during her mentorship, a young sickle-cell patient ran up
to her, yelling, "Megan, Megan, I love you! Let's go play!"</TE>
<TE>   She overheard a doctor standing next to her say, "That is why I
became a pediatrician."</TE>
<TE>   Morsheimer plans to study neonatology.</TE>
<TE>   Changes like that are frequent among Gene Black students.</TE>
<TE>   By the third week, Peng had reconsidered motherhood. After
watching the epidural, she decided she could handle the pain. Now she
says she wants children.</TE>
<TE>   Broussard, too, has reconsidered at least one decision.</TE>
<TE>   He still doesn't want to practice pediatrics, but he has learned
two things about screaming babies.</TE>
<TE>   They're healthy.</TE>
<TE>   And he doesn't mind anymore when they cry.</TE>

<HD>Gus Dudgeon, 57; Record Producer Aided Elton John</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gus Dudgeon, the British record producer whose imaginative work
played a central role in most of Elton John's hit albums and singles
of the 1970s, has died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   Dudgeon and his wife, Sheila, were killed July 21 in England when
their car veered off the road on their way home from a 50th birthday
party for a musician in another band that Dudgeon had worked with in
the '70s.</LD>
<LD>   John had teamed up with lyricist Bernie Taupin and had made one
album, "Empty Sky," with another producer, but it wasn't until they
brought Dudgeon aboard for the 1970 album "Elton John" and the single
"Your Song" that John had his worldwide commercial breakthrough.</LD>
<TE>   Dudgeon was an essential part of John's team on a dozen albums,
seven of which reached No. 1 in the U.S. He oversaw the recording of
such Top 10 singles as "Rocket Man," "Crocodile Rock," "Goodbye
Yellow Brick Road" and "Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me," helping
make John the most successful singles artist of the 1970s, and No. 2
on the album charts behind Elvis Presley.</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence or not, after parting with Dudgeon to work with
other producers, John didn't score another Top 10 album for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   John said he was devastated over the death of Dudgeon, whom he
described as "an incredibly talented producer and a very dear
friend."</TE>
<TE>   Before teaming up with John, Dudgeon had worked in the 1960s as an
engineer for several major British acts of that decade, including the
Rolling Stones, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers when Eric Clapton was a
member, Marianne Faithfull and the Moody Blues.</TE>
<TE>   He also produced David Bowie's "Space Oddity" in 1969, a song that
didn't become a hit until it was re-released in 1973, but was the
record that John credited with inspiring him to seek out Dudgeon to
produce his own recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Dudgeon also produced tracks or albums by Ten Years After, Joan
Armatrading, XTC and the Bonzo Dog Band, and John's version of
"Pinball Wizard" for the 1975 film version of the Who's rock opera
"Tommy."</TE>
<TE>   One of his most unusual projects as producer was "I'm the Only
Hell Mama Ever Raised," a 1977 album collaboration between country
singers George Jones and Johnny Paycheck, on which John and most of
his regular band provided instrumental backing.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Dudgeon had been working with British band Slinky
on a tribute to the comic Bonzo Dog Band.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Surrey, England, Dudgeon started his career as an in-house
engineer at Decca Records.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial is planned for September.</TE>

<HD>Measure Would Urge Base Cleanup</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters could be faced with another November ballot
measure involving El Toro, this one urging the Navy to remove toxic
contamination before the former Marine base can be sold.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad will ask her colleagues Tuesday to
place a measure regarding cleanup at the base on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an effort to protect the county and the county taxpayers
from the cost of cleanup and to protect our citizens," Coad said
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The Navy has certified as clean about 85% of the 4,700-acre base,
which is designated as one of the most polluted sites in the country.
Navy officials said they plan no further cleanup before the sale.</TE>
<TE>   A nonbinding county measure would have no authority over the Navy,
which plans to sell the base land in the coming months. But its
passage could present political problems, given the military's
cleanup record at other bases.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Hurley, an environmental attorney and past chairman of the
local environmental review board for El Toro, applauded the advisory
measure, even if it only sends a message to the Navy. Hurley has
criticized the Navy for refusing to sample soil around the base to
determine what contaminants might be uncovered during development.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ecstatic to hear that the board is considering this," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed measure joins another suggested this week by
Supervisor Chuck Smith that would require voter approval of any
changes to a final redevelopment plan for El Toro. Voters in March
grounded the county's plans for a commercial airport and created new
zoning for a large urban park. Irvine, which wants to annex the
property, has modified that plan by adding 3,400 homes and 2.9
million square feet of office space.</TE>
<TE>   Studies by Irvine and the county have suggested that the Navy's
search for toxic contamination at El Toro was inadequate. Sen. Dianne

<HD>3 Teenagers Escape From Juvenile Hall</HD>
<DH>Crime: They use a gun, apparently smuggled in, to overpower
guards, authorities say. Two of the inmates had been convicted of
murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three teenagers escaped from Central Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles
late Wednesday, including two convicted of murder in adult courts,
after they overpowered guards using a firearm that was apparently
smuggled in, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Argueta, 17, Marvin Sandoval, 17, and Fernando Nupiri, 18,
who remained at large Thursday evening, began their escape about
11:35 p.m. the previous night, when one was allowed out of his locked
room to get a drink of water, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "He returned brandishing a firearm at the group night supervisor,"
said county Probation Department spokesman Ken Kondo, who would not
disclose which of the three began the breakout. "The minor then
ordered the three members of the staff to lie down on the floor, and
he let the other two out of their rooms."</LD>
<TE>   After locking staffers in one of the 10-by-12-foot rooms, the
three scaled a 20-foot wall, which surrounds much of the Eastlake
Avenue facility in the shadow of County-USC Medical Center, Kondo
said. They then apparently jumped the wall, topped with razor wire,
on the west side of the building that is adorned with murals of
athletes Oscar De La Hoya and Florence Griffith Joyner.</TE>
<TE>   A hunt began shortly before midnight for the three, described as
armed and dangerous. Los Angeles police brought in dogs and aircraft
but were unable to immediately track down the escapees.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very dangerous people," said LAPD Officer Jason Lee.
"Their ages don't reflect their danger to the public. No one should
try to approach them. Just dial 911." Police said the three escaped
using a .45-caliber handgun.</TE>
<TE>   The Probation Department, which runs the hall, received a Juvenile
Court judge's permission Thursday to release the names of the
escapees.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta, who goes by the street name Lil' Crazy, was convicted in
February 2001 of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the shooting
of a 27-year-old former leader of an Armenian street gang at a
Hollywood Boulevard deli the previous May. Argueta has a distinct WF
tattoo on the back of his head, a reference to White Fence, a
longtime Latino gang.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office says Argueta is awaiting sentencing
and faces a possible 50 years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval was also convicted of murder in an adult court. Nupiri
was in custody on a probation violation; he had been convicted of a
carjacking in South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   Officials described Argueta as 5 feet 5, weighing 145 pounds;
Sandoval is 5 feet 4 and 140 pounds; and Nupiri is 5 feet 5 and 120
pounds. Police said all three are gang members and were isolated from
the rest of the inmates because of their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The facility from which they escaped, also known as Eastlake
Juvenile Hall, is the county's largest juvenile detention center and
houses its most violent and repeat young offenders as well as some
accused of lesser offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at the 620-bed facility do not carry firearms, and entry
is forbidden with any kind of weapon, Kondo said. In addition, he
said, the center is equipped with metal detectors. Department
officials were trying to determine how the weapon was smuggled in.</TE>
<TE>   One of the three employees who was held at gunpoint was taken to a
nearby hospital for a wrist injury; two others were treated for minor
injuries at the hall, Kondo said.</TE>
<TE>   .Sources said investigators are trying to determine whether the
gun the teenagers used had been smuggled in in a cake.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, several embarrassing escapes from Central
Juvenile Hall took place.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, two armed teenagers entered the building and freed an
inmate, firing shots at a security guard as they fled. The same year,
three youths being held in a disciplinary unit jimmied open a window
and scaled a wall.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic escape occurred in 1990, when a motorist crashed
through a fence with a car, and six young men who were in the
recreation yard fled.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's escape is at least the second this year from a county
juvenile facility. A 17-year-old convicted of attempted murder
escaped in March from Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar by
smashing a window and scaling a razor wire fence.</TE>
<TE>   Police ask anyone with information to call (213) 485-2942.</TE>

<HD>Freeman 'Surprised' at Alleged Gouging by DWP</HD>
<DH>Power crisis: The former agency chief says he was unaware
of any Enron-like maneuvering but downplays its seriousness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State power official S. David Freeman on Thursday deplored an alleged
act of price gouging during the energy crisis by the Los Angeles city
power department he once headed, but claimed it was not as bad as a
similar scheme by the Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Freeman, former general manager of the city Department of Water
and Power, told state Senate investigators that he had no knowledge
of the incident of "ricocheting" in 2000 until he read of it in The
Times last month.</LD>
<LD>   In his deposition, Freeman testified he was "surprised and
disappointed" by what appeared to be the exercise of market tactics
by department energy traders that violated his standing orders for
employees to avoid anything that "comes anywhere close to violating
[marketing] rules or is in any way manipulative."</LD>
<TE>   "It was a bad thing. It should not have been done," Freeman said.
But he insisted that adverse effects were relatively minor and "not
of the same order of magnitude as the Enron type" of ricochet
manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, an expert on public power for almost 30 years, was
appointed by Gov. Gray Davis last August to the $220,000-a-year
position as chief of the newly created state public power authority.
However, his confirmation to the post has drawn fire from Senate
Republicans, who challenged his fitness to serve. At the insistence
of Republicans, Freeman's confirmation by the full Senate has been
held up, at least until GOP questions about his leadership at the DWP
have been addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San Francisco), who voted for
Freeman at a Rules Committee hearing, said outside Thursday's hearing
that he believed Freeman would survive the challenge and be
confirmed. "He only needs 21 votes," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   During the energy crisis, when Davis and other Democrats blistered
private power generators such as Enron for price gouging as
California struggled to keep the lights on, Republicans questioned
whether the DWP was also engaged in charging excessive rates in sales
to the state. A newly disclosed memo suggesting that the department
engaged in ricocheting appeared to strengthen their position.</TE>
<TE>   Energy market experts generally use the term ricochet, or megawatt
laundering, to describe the export and import of electricity across
the California border with an aim of inflating prices. In the fall of
2000, as the power crisis was worsening, such a strategy could allow
a generator to earn more money by circumventing a federal price cap
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, now bankrupt but once the nation's largest trader of
electricity, documented a ricochet scheme used by its traders in a
December 2000 memo made public in May by federal energy regulators.
Ricochet, as described by Enron, involved buying power in
California's market, arranging to sell it out of state to another
company, then buying back a similar amount of power and selling it at
a higher price to California grid operators.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP officials have insisted that although it was dubbed
"ricochet," the November 2000 transaction by their traders did not
fit the Enron definition. The DWP officials describe their action as
a power sale that moved electricity to the state border then
redirected it back into California. The electricity never left
California, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the power moved by DWP was resold to state grid
operators at five times the price DWP paid for it, the DWP officials
claim they earned only $1,250 for moving the electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman told Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) and committee staff
investigators that he believed the actions of his traders was
deplorable but technically legal. He also suggested he believed it
was an isolated incident.</TE>
<TE>   But Morrow told Freeman that the committee has found "there were
at least an additional 20 instances where the DWP was involved in
ricochet-like transactions of this nature in the year 2000."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said he was surprised at the disclosure and repeated that
the DWP was supposed to help transmit power to wherever it was needed
in California, but not as a profit-making enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   He said the 2000 case identified by the committee "seemed to me to
be completely different than the ricochet described by Enron." He
said as a public utility, the DWP "legitimately" transmitted power
where it was needed and deserved a reasonable payment for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   But Freeman asserted the DWP was in a "different category than an
organization that was bidding a bunch of money that they shouldn't
have gotten."</TE>

<HD>Crash Closes Interstate 5 Near Marine Base</HD>
<DH>Accident: Two big rigs overturn, shutting all southbound
lanes through Camp Pendleton for seven hours. It's the third closure
there since May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All southbound lanes of the heavily traveled Interstate 5 through
Camp Pendleton were closed for seven hours Thursday after two big
rigs--one carrying a sticky tar-like substance--crashed on the
principal route between Orange and San Diego counties.</LD>
<LD>   The accident backed up traffic for 10 miles and is the third
incident since May to close the freeway where it cuts through the
rugged coastal expanse of the Marine base. Caltrans, however, has no
plans to build alternate roads as escape routes for trapped
motorists. Major accidents are rare, and the freeway is not
considered congested, Caltrans officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The stretch of Interstate 5 through the base handles at least
130,000 vehicles a day and forces marooned motorists to wait hours in
traffic or take a long, circuitous detour through Riverside County
when the highway is blocked.</LD>
<TE>   "Once I-5 is closed there is not a lot commuters can do unless
they want to travel way out of their way or take the train," said Tom
Nipper, a Caltrans spokesman. "There are no good alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's accident occurred about 3:35 a.m., when a tanker truck
and a trailer truck flipped over near Las Pulgas Road, about halfway
through the base. Both drivers suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cause of the accident is being investigated,
authorities said the tanker apparently hit a bridge rail and turned
over, spilling 25,000 pounds of a main ingredient of asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   The second truck, carrying a load of clothing, skidded in the
spill, flipped on its side and burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   By morning rush hour, traffic had backed up to the Orange County
border, where CHP officers diverted motorists onto Christianitos Road
and advised them of alternative routes such as Ortega Highway--a
narrow mountain route through southern Orange County--and Interstate
15 in Riverside County. Both roads experienced significant increases
in traffic Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Two southbound lanes of the freeway were reopened about 10:35 a.m.
But for those stranded in the crash, the only thing to do was wait
until the wreckage was cleared and take a narrow two-lane path
through the base.</TE>
<TE>   An anxious and exasperated Laurie Horton, 52, of Dana Point was
already three hours late for an appointment in Encinitas when she
arrived at the Las Pulgas gate about 10:30 a.m. Horton said she left
her home at 6 a.m. for a gymnastics class she teaches at the
Encinitas YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got 50 kids waiting for me, and I've got the only key,"
Horton said. "The frustration level is pretty high."</TE>
<TE>   Motorists who were diverted onto Camp Pendleton made a 15-minute
trip through the base before reentering the freeway in Oceanside.
Many commuters, however, simply turned around.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the Marine base, there are no other freeways or major
surface streets that can accommodate motorists stranded by major
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines generally have allowed drivers to use one lane of a
two-lane road on the base that parallels Interstate 5. But the going
is slow and access depends on Camp Pendleton's security needs.</TE>
<TE>   The other alternative is to take commuter rail or drive some
combination of the Riverside Freeway, Ortega Highway, Interstate 15
in Riverside County, and Routes 78 and 76 in north San Diego County.
The detour is 50 to 60 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said they hoped to have the rest of the freeway
open by this morning. But they cautioned motorists to check before
starting their morning commutes.</TE>
<TE>   In May, traffic on Interstate 5 was halted for almost an hour when
a stranded motorist opened fire on a tow truck driver and a Marine
before he was shot to death by police. A month later, a tanker truck
was rear-ended near Las Pulgas Road, spilling its cargo of jet fuel.
The southbound lanes were closed for five hours.</TE>

<HD>Crash Closes I-5 Near Base</HD>
<DH>Accident: Two big rigs overturn, shutting all southbound
lanes through Camp Pendleton for seven hours. It's the third closure
on that stretch of freeway since May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All southbound lanes of the heavily traveled Interstate 5 through
Camp Pendleton were closed for seven hours Thursday after two big
rigs--one carrying a sticky tar-like substance--crashed on the
principal route between Orange and San Diego counties.</LD>
<LD>   The accident backed up traffic for 10 miles and is the third
incident since May to close the freeway where it cuts through the
rugged coastal expanse of the Marine base. Caltrans, however, has no
plans to build alternate roads as escape routes for trapped
motorists. Major accidents are rare, and the freeway is not
considered congested, Caltrans officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The stretch of Interstate 5 through the base handles at least
130,000 vehicles a day and forces marooned motorists to wait hours in
traffic or take a long, circuitous detour through Riverside County
when the highway is blocked.</LD>
<TE>   "Once I-5 is closed there is not a lot commuters can do unless
they want to travel way out of their way or take the train," said Tom
Nipper, a Caltrans spokesman. "There are no good alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's accident occurred about 3:35 a.m., when a tanker truck
and a trailer truck flipped over near Las Pulgas Road, about halfway
through the base. Both drivers suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cause of the accident is being investigated,
authorities said the tanker apparently hit a bridge rail and turned
over, spilling 25,000 pounds of a sticky material that is a main
ingredient of asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   The second truck, carrying a load of clothing, skidded in the
spill, flipped on its side and burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   By morning rush hour, traffic had backed up to the Orange County
border, where CHP officers diverted motorists onto Christianitos Road
and advised them of alternative routes such as Ortega Highway--a
narrow mountain route through southern Orange County--and Interstate
15 in Riverside County. Both roads experienced significant increases
in traffic Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Two southbound lanes of the freeway were reopened about 10:35 a.m.
But for those stranded in the crash, the only thing to do was wait
until the wreckage was cleared and take a narrow two-lane path
through the base.</TE>
<TE>   An anxious and exasperated Laurie Horton, 52, of Dana Point was
already three hours late for an appointment in Encinitas when she
arrived at the Las Pulgas gate about 10:30 a.m. Horton said she left
her home at 6 a.m. for a gymnastics class she teaches at the
Encinitas YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got 50 kids waiting for me, and I've got the only key,"
Horton said. "The frustration level is pretty high. What's making it
worse is I don't have a cell phone and I can't get ahold of anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Horton said her situation wasn't nearly as desperate as others on
Interstate 5 who were trapped in their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "One woman had all these little babies who were crying because
they had run out of milk," she said. "I felt so bad for her, but
there was nothing anyone could do."</TE>
<TE>   When she reached the Las Pulgas gate, Crystal McMillan of Carson
was more than three hours late for her 7:30 a.m. nursing shift in the
intensive care unit at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in La Jolla.
McMillan, who is seven months' pregnant, was ecstatic when Camp
Pendleton Marines allowed her to use a restroom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been very uncomfortable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, McMillan's commute from Carson to La Jolla takes an hour
and 45 minutes. But Thursday, it took her five hours just to reach
Camp Pendleton. "It's been quite the nightmare, but I'm getting
there."</TE>
<TE>   Motorists who were diverted onto Camp Pendleton made a 15-minute
trip through the base before reentering the freeway in Oceanside.
Many commuters, however, simply turned around.</TE>
<TE>   Ramiro Portillo and his crew of painters were already three hours
late for an appointment in Oceanside, so they decided to head back to
Tustin after reaching Las Pulgas. But before they headed back home,
Portillo broke out a portable gas grill and made chicken, rice and
bean burritos for his men.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have sold these on the freeway," said Portillo, 32, of
Huntington Park. "I could have made a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the Marine base, there are no other freeways or major
surface streets that can accommodate motorists stranded by major
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines generally have allowed drivers to use one lane of a
two-lane road on the base that parallels Interstate 5. But the going
is slow and access depends on Camp Pendleton's security needs.</TE>
<TE>   The other alternative is to take commuter rail or drive some
combination of the Riverside Freeway, Ortega Highway, Interstate 15
in Riverside County, and Routes 78 and 76 in north San Diego County.
The detour is 50 to 60 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said they hoped to have the rest of the freeway
open by this morning. But they cautioned motorists to check before
starting their morning commutes.</TE>
<TE>   In May, traffic on Interstate 5 was halted for almost an hour when
a stranded motorist opened fire on a tow truck driver and a Marine
before he was shot to death by police. A month later, a tanker truck
was rear-ended near Las Pulgas Road, spilling its cargo of jet fuel.
The southbound lanes were closed for five hours.</TE>

<HD>Kenneth Gardner, 89; Sang With Guy Lombardo's Band</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth A. "Kenny" Gardner, the tenor who voiced such signature hits
for Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians as "Enjoy Yourself, It's
Later Than You Think" and "Frankie and Johnny," died July 26 in
Manhasset, N.Y. He was 89 and died of a heart attack after an
appendectomy.</LD>
<LD>   Gardner crooned with the dance band--formed in 1917 and still
performing under the direction of Al Pierson--from 1940 until 1978.
The famous big band sold more than 300 million records, played at
every presidential inaugural from Franklin D. Roosevelt's in 1933 to
Jimmy Carter's in 1977, and became a nationally televised fixture on
New Year's Eve. For decades, it seemed America could not welcome a
new year without hearing the band play "Auld Lang Syne."</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody counted on us always being there," Gardner said in 1984
when the Guy Lombardo Museum opened in the bandleader's native
London, Ontario, in Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the bandleader, his sister Elaine (whom Gardner married)
and Lombardo's brothers who played in the band, Gardner was not a
native Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   He was born March 20, 1913, in Lakeview, Iowa. He ignored a
college scholarship to sing on Los Angeles radio shows and then
quickly found a career home with the Lombardo band.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner took time out to serve in Europe during World War II,
where he was wounded and earned a Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   With no formal musical training--he couldn't even read music--the
intimidated singer decided to take lessons after he was hired by the
hugely famous band.</TE>
<TE>   But carefully rehearsed and precisely repeated style was
everything in the Lombardo band, and the leader was not pleased by
Gardner's good intentions.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1994 video tribute to Lombardo, Gardner recalled: "Guy came
up to me one night and he just laid it on the line. He said, 'Are you
taking music lessons?' I said, 'Yeah, I'm taking music lessons.' He
looked at me cold turkey and said: 'Stop. You're changing the style
of the band.' And that was it. I stopped. I got the message: You play
it by ear."</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement in 1978, a year after Lombardo's death,
Gardner devoted himself to civic service in the Long Island town
where he settled, Plandome, N.Y. He served as trustee of the village
and was active in the volunteer Plandome Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1999 by the death of his wife of 59 years, Gardner left
no immediate survivors.</TE>

<HD>Gerald Gunther, 75; Stanford Law Lecturer, Scholar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gerald Gunther, one of the country's most respected constitutional
law scholars whose childhood in Nazi Germany drove him to fight for
the protection of civil liberties, died Tuesday. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Gunther, also known for writing a widely used constitutional law
textbook and a definitive biography of his mentor, Judge Learned
Hand, died of lung cancer at his home in Palo Alto, said his son,
Daniel Gunther.</LD>
<LD>   Gunther taught at several law schools, including a 40-year stretch
at Stanford University, where he continued to lecture after retiring
in 1995. Before teaching, Gunther was a clerk for Hand, a U.S. Court
of Appeals judge, and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren.</LD>
<TE>   During the 1970s and '80s, Gunther's name was often mentioned as a
U.S. Supreme Court candidate, with a 1987 National Law Journal poll
ranking him as best qualified for the post. However, Gunther never
got the call.</TE>
<TE>   He mentored several leading lawyers and jurists, including Supreme
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stanford Law School Dean
Kathleen M. Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   Ginsburg called Gunther the country's leading constitutional law
scholar and judicial biographer.</TE>
<TE>   "His commentary, and the counsel I retain in my mind, will
continue to guide me through all my days on the bench," she said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan called Gunther a "constitutional oracle" who loved
counseling students as much as he enjoyed firing off letters to
institutions he thought were restricting people's speech, including
Stanford. But he was also a modest man, she said, so shy he could
barely ask her for help with the most recent two editions of his
textbook.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a towering giant in the field of constitutional law,"
Sullivan said. "But I hasten to add, a gentle giant. For all of his
prestige and respect and fame, he was always quite humble when
relating to others."</TE>
<TE>   Gunther's children described him as a soccer enthusiast and
history buff who especially enjoyed books on the country's early
court system. But they added that his life is best illustrated
through his work.</TE>
<TE>   "You see a lot of the man through his scholarly pursuits because
for him, legal work was a way to use his intellect to make a better
world and to care for other people," said Daniel Gunther, a lawyer in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Gunther said his father cared so much about civil liberties
because he had experienced their absence while growing up in Usingen,
Germany, a town near Frankfurt. Since the family's roots in the town
extended three centuries, they were reluctant to leave despite laws
against Jews. But when the town's synagogue was burned in 1938,
11-year-old Gunther fled with his family to Brooklyn, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd seen a legal system turned inside out and put in the service
of a tyrannical order," Daniel Gunther said. "A legal career gave him
a way of fighting back and providing meaningful protection to all
kinds of people in a civilized, respectful way."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Gunther's defense of civil liberties included freedom of
speech and extended to American Nazis, who in 1976 marched in Skokie,
Ill., despite threats of violence and the protests of Holocaust
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote about the incident in the Stanford Law Review, saying
that permitting actions that people found offensive "is a central
test of a community's commitment to free speech."</TE>
<TE>   His writings also included the 1994 biography, "Learned Hand: The
Man and the Judge," an award-winning book based on 22 years of
research and writing. Gunther also wrote "Constitutional Law," the
most widely used textbook on the subject in American law schools
during the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The late Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote in 1994
that the casebook was "the leading publication in the field, from
which a generation of American lawyers have learned constitutional
law."</TE>
<TE>   Gunther's students said his classes had a profound impact on their
understanding of constitutional law.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought constitutional law to life, not with flash or
witticisms but with his intellect and encyclopedic knowledge of
constitutional law," said Andy White, a Century City attorney who
became interested in 1st Amendment law after taking Gunther's class
as a Stanford student in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Gunther loved telling stories about historical figures and the
legal world--whether to his students or to his grandchildren--though
they sometimes went off track, said Los Angeles lawyer and former
student Robert C. Vanderet.</TE>
<TE>   "He would sometimes get lost in thought while lecturing and forget
the beginning of a sentence he had started as his mind drifted off on
a tangent," Vanderet said. "But the tangents often turned out to be
fresh, brilliant insights that were well worth the wait."</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Brooklyn College, Gunther received a master's degree
in public law and government from Columbia and a law degree from
Harvard, where he was editor of the law review.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Daniel, Gunther is survived by his wife,
Barbara; another son, Andrew of Santa Cruz; a brother, Herbert
Gutenstein of Riverdale, New York; and two grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Son of British Law Official Accused of Stalking, Vandalism</HD>
<DH>Crime: England's tabloid papers headline case of threats
against Newport tanning salon employee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a case grabbing tabloid headlines in London, the son of England's
top law enforcement official has been jailed in Orange County for
more than a month on stalking and vandalism charges.</LD>
<LD>   Alistair Irvine, 25, is the son of Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine,
who is a friend of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The lord
chancellor administers the court system and advises on the
appointment of judges.</LD>
<LD>   Alistair Irvine allegedly stalked the boyfriend of a 19-year-old
tanning salon employee and vandalized the man's car.</LD>
<TE>   Tori Richards, a spokeswoman for the Orange County district
attorney's office, said Irvine approached the woman in early June at
the Newport Tanning Club in Newport Beach and asked about starting a
romantic relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "She told him she had a boyfriend, but Mr. Irvine continued to
bring flowers to her and call her," Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   On June 6, Irvine allegedly poured an unidentified substance on
the boyfriend's truck, causing $5,700 in damage, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Irvine went to the woman's workplace with a gun
in his belt, threatening the life of the boyfriend, prosecutors and
Costa Mesa police said.</TE>
<TE>   "The couple went to police to report what Mr. Irvine was doing,"
Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   Police searched Irvine's home and found two unlicensed handguns
and some type of caustic chemical.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine has been charged with stalking, making a criminal threat,
vandalism and carrying a concealed weapon.</TE>
<TE>   He also was charged with second-degree burglary, a felony, for
allegedly breaking into a locked Mercedes-Benz in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is scheduled to be arraigned on Aug. 6 in Orange County
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   His arrest has been fodder for British tabloids, prompting the
lord chancellor's office to release a statement Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Alistair's family are supporting him in his current problems as
they always have," the statement read. "Beyond that they have nothing
to say about Alistair's personal problems. The U.S. legal process
must take its course in the normal way."</TE>
<TE>   British newspapers broke the story Wednesday, with headlines such
as "Sins of the Son."</TE>
<TE>   The papers reported that Irvine went to San Diego several months
ago to enroll in a drug treatment center for cocaine abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The Times of London described Irvine as a bodybuilder who
apparently met the woman while getting a tan at her shop.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials have blocked Irvine's release on $100,000
bail, a standard procedure for any immigrant charged with a crime.</TE>

<HD>A Potpourri of 90th Birthday Parties</HD>
<DH>Celebration: A benefit is the appetizer in a series of
food-laden fetes before Julia Child's big day.</DH>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It's not every day that an American icon turns 90, and, strictly
speaking, she hasn't. But when the icon is Julia Child, can there
really be a wrong time for a celebratory "bon appetit"?</LD>
<LD>   "Well, I think it's all pretty nice, don't you? What's on the
menu?" the grande dame trilled Thursday, as a nationwide blitz of
birthday parties was kicked off in this food mecca two weeks before
her birthday. Her shoulders were stooped, her curls were thinning and
she steered her no-longer-6-foot-2-inch frame into the star-studded
dining room with the aid of a bright blue walker. But that fat,
throaty voice still had the power to make ordinary syllables sound
mouthwatering. "Wild," she murmured, deliciously, as flashbulbs
popped and Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse's famed Alice Waters
rushed up with a bouquet of roses from her garden. "Just wild, isn't
it?"</LD>
<LD>   Child, of course, is known to millions as the unintentionally
droll "French Chef" who revolutionized American attitudes about food
in the 1960s with her public television series and sophisticated
recipes. In a nation of TV dinners and tuna casseroles, she raised
the consciousness of a provincial public by demystifying fine dining.</LD>
<TE>   "Have the courage of your convictions," the native Californian
once warbled to viewers, scraping a potato pancake back into the pan
after she had accidentally flipped half of it onto her studio stove
top.</TE>
<TE>   The incident later became the stuff of "Saturday Night Live"
spoofs, but Child's confidence was liberating, at the time, for
Kennedy era housewives trying to live up to the standards of a White
House with a real French chef in the kitchen. Child's classic
"Mastering the Art of French Cooking" became, for a while, the
kitchen equivalent of Dr. Benjamin Spock's "Baby and Child Care."</TE>
<TE>   Child Remains Active</TE>
<TE>   Though she moved last year from her longtime home in Cambridge,
Mass., to a retirement community in Montecito and has spent much of
the last year recuperating from a series of back surgeries, she has
remained active, especially philanthropically.</TE>
<TE>   She was on hand this year for the grand opening of Copia: The
American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts in Napa, and, in a
departure--for she is famously tight with endorsements--she allowed
the museum to use her name for its centerpiece restaurant, Julia's
Kitchen. Her own kitchen in Cambridge, with its copper pots and
whisks and peg boards, has been dismantled and donated to Copia and
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's extravaganza was also an act of philanthropy on Child's
part--or, more accurately, Day 1 of a monthlong barrage of charity.
The San Francisco dinner at the stylish Fifth Floor restaurant,
benefiting the scholarship fund of the International Assn. of
Culinary Professionals Foundation, was the first of three birthday
fund-raisers in three nights on Child's packed calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Having dispatched with vichyssoise, nicoise salad, Atlantic
halibut, Sonoma duck breast and a six-layer pecan marjolaine with
coffee chocolate mousse Thursday night, Child will head north tonight
to the Napa Valley for a $500-a-plate gala at Copia. That menu: foie
gras, monkfish, more duck, a confection involving ladyfingers called
charlotte malakoff au chocolat and a specially created $90-a-bottle
sparkling rose.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, she's back at the museum again for a $100-a-person
French buffet for the media and museum members. (Prawns on ice,
oysters, more nicoise salad, roast beef, rack of lamb, chicken on
polenta, crepes suzette and a confection called, simply, Julia's
Birthday Cake.)</TE>
<TE>   And on Sunday, she's tentatively scheduled for yet another Copia
appearance, which may or may not involve more food. Then it's off to
Maine, where she will retreat with family members to celebrate her
real date of birth on Aug. 15. Three more fetes, with proceeds going
to the American Institute of Wine and Food, are scheduled for later
this month in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, when I heard there were all these parties planned, I
just couldn't imagine her wanting to do all of this," confided
Waters, who has RSVP'd to all the weekend dinners as well.</TE>
<TE>   Copia's director, Peggy Loar, said her staff had made a special
effort to stock up on pre-signed bookplates for the weekend's events
there, so Child would not be inundated with requests for book
signings, as occurred when she showed up for the opening of the
museum.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spoken on the phone with her in the last two months, and she
was as bright as a tack," Loar said. "And she never says no--she's
just a sweetheart--but we don't want to tire her out."</TE>
<TE>   Child, whose persona has always featured a certain brusque vigor,
shrugged off the notion that an 89-year-old woman might not be up to
quite this much action for her big nine O.</TE>
<TE>   "It's for a good cause, so it's OK with me--just part of doing
business," she said. "I don't have to do any of the cooking. I'm just
there! Eating! And that doesn't take too much energy, does it now?"</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide Endeavor</TE>
<TE>   Not for her, maybe. Thursday's dinner, prepared by Fifth Floor's
Laurent Gras and former Iron Chef winner Ron Siegel of Masa's
restaurant, was just the hub of a nationwide endeavor that comprised
20 simultaneous benefits hosted by celebrity chefs at high-end
restaurants from Seattle to Chicago to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Each featured regional food personalities and special menus based
on Child's cookbooks. At New York's French Culinary Institute, for
instance, Jacques Pepin hosted a $275-to-$375-a-plate dinner for 67
donors. In Boston, one of Child's favorite restaurants, Hamersley's
Bistro, fed a five-course, all-lobster (except for dessert) dinner to
a sellout crowd of 120 at $120-a-plate.</TE>
<TE>   The $300-a-plate dinner in San Francisco also sold out, not least
because of Child's presence, which elevated the meal from a mere
fund-raiser to a sort of culinary version of a summons to dinner with
the queen. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown swept in before the first
course, champagne flute in hand, to offer a special toast to the
honoree.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely certain that I'm the envy of every mayor in the
country," Brown said, as the crowd called, "Hear, hear." "I'm in the
presence at this moment of a true American gem."</TE>
<TE>   Though the guest list included many of Child's contemporaries, it
was unclear how many genuinely knew her as a close friend. Anne
Willan, director of the L.A. Varenne Cooking School, an old pal, was
there, as was Bon Appetit editor in chief Barbara Fairchild, also a
friend. But Child's career was mostly spent on the East Coast, and
the Bay Area food scene tends more to revolve around the younger
Waters, who is approaching iconhood in her own right.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the evening, Waters--who has known Child for
decades--was preoccupied with her own fans.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, however, Waters approached Child and told her, "I
had the most amazing dream last night. I dreamed you fell asleep on
my shoulder." Child looked momentarily flummoxed. "Hmm," she said.
"Well, I'm glad I was there."</TE>
<TE>   Child herself spent most of a pre-dinner reception doing TV
interviews and resting in a separate room.</TE>
<TE>   Windfall for Her Causes</TE>
<TE>   Formality notwithstanding, the evening was a windfall for Child's
pet causes. Paul Barrett, immediate past chairman of the culinary
professionals foundation, said the group had done a similar, less
coordinated benefit for Child's 85th birthday, and had approached her
again last year for permission to capitalize on this milestone.
Barrett estimated that Thursday's parties would generate more than
$100,000 for the foundation, of which Child is a founding trustee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing, but Julia always has this energy," he said. "She's
very involved, and so much more than a name on the stationery. This
is the biggest thing I think we've ever done."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Child shrugged off the praise, insisting that
"they'll take anything that is an opportunity for a fund-raiser." Nor
was the woman who once credited her longevity to "red meat and gin"
particularly sentimental about turning 90: "I used to think 30 was
terribly old," she joked. "Didn't you?"</TE>
<TE>   She added, however, that she intends to savor this occasion,
especially her family party.</TE>
<TE>   "There'll be 18 of us, ranging from 9 to 90," at a spread that is
likely to be far simpler than anything this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to have a little fish chowder, then some lobster, I
think; it's so good up there," she said, her mouth lingering, Julia
Child-like, over the words, "good" and "chowder" and "lobster."</TE>
<TE>   "And for dessert," she went on, "whatever is nice and fresh. If
the peaches are still in at that point, I'd love them--or some
beautiful, fresh, sweet strawberries! And fresh peas in the pod--I
love them! Though I do love a nice big chocolate cake...."</TE>

<HD>LAX to Add 1,200 Surveillance Cameras for Increased
Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city hopes to curb evacuations and more closely monitor terminals
for criminal activity at Los Angeles International Airport by
quintupling the number of surveillance cameras focused on facility
curbs, ticket lobbies, terminal doors and the airfield.</LD>
<LD>   The city agency that operates LAX will spend as much as $20
million to add 1,200 closed-circuit television cameras in the
airport's nine terminals and on the 3,500-acre airfield by December
2004. Each terminal will receive up to 150 new cameras.</LD>
<LD>   The security upgrade, announced Thursday by Mayor James K. Hahn at
LAX, follows strong criticism of the city's failure to capture on
tape the fatal Fourth of July shooting at the Tom Bradley
International Terminal. Ticket lobbies at the airport now have no
video cameras.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said that having cameras in the Bradley lobby would not
have prevented the shooting at the El Al Israel Airlines ticket
counter, where seven airport police officers and several undercover
officers stood guard Thursday morning. But they said video of the
incident would have helped police sort out what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have made the follow-up investigation easier, because we
would have been able to look at more things," said Bernard J. Wilson,
airport police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's announcement was the latest in a series of moves by
Hahn to bolster security at LAX, including a request that the airport
agency pay 60 Los Angeles Police Department officers overtime to
patrol the facility and a plan to spend $15 million on new fencing
and other technology around the facility's perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   The new security camera program will integrate four existing
systems at LAX that operate independently of one another. These
systems, with a total of 300 cameras, are used by airport police to
deter theft at security checkpoints and in parking lots; by
operations personnel to monitor the airfield; by airlines to watch
ramps and terminals; and by various U.S. agencies to keep tabs on
Customs Service facilities.</TE>
<TE>   After the upgrade, airport police will be able to view pictures
provided by each of 1,500 cameras from a new centralized monitoring
station.</TE>
<TE>   "LAX will be the first airport in the U.S. to have such a
comprehensive system," said Paul Green, chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Officials emphasized that the airport's current camera system
meets federal guidelines, which require that cameras be installed at
the entrances and exits of security checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officers will be able to tap into the new camera
system wirelessly using a hand-held computer and pull down live
photos or a video clip of a suspect. The same technology has
undergone testing at London's Heathrow Airport but has yet to be used
regularly in a public place like LAX, said Jonathan Phillips, a
principal communications consultant for Arup Co. who advised the
airport agency on the technology.</TE>
<TE>   Having immediate access to a picture of a criminal suspect or the
perpetrator of a security breach would help police find the
individual more quickly and reduce terminal evacuations, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This will help with problems like last week where a human error
allowed someone to get through the system," said Hahn, referring to a
security breach in Terminal 5 on Saturday that forced the evacuation
of the airport's entire south side, delaying 150 flights and
stranding 8,000 passengers. "We want to minimize those inconveniences
in the future using this video system."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) appeared
with Hahn in the Bradley terminal and called on the White House to
support additional funding for airports to implement new security
measures.</TE>

<HD>Latino Outreach Gets Boost at CSUN</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cal State Northridge library has received a $1.6-million grant to
increase its outreach to the Latino community, university officials
announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The grant, awarded by the state Department of Education, is part
of a research project intended to demonstrate that students perform
better when they spend more time at the library and develop research
skills.</LD>
<LD>   Sue Curzon, library dean, said the money will be used to expand
collection materials on Latino history, social sciences and culture.
She said it also will be used to locate and improve the accessibility
of archival materials involving Latinos in Los Angeles, and to
educate students on using the library.</LD>
<TE>   The grant will be dispersed over five years, Curzon said. The
library's annual budget is $7.2 million, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This grant is about connecting students to libraries," Curzon
said. "Knowing how to use a library and information resources is one
of the foundations of student success."</TE>
<TE>   The grant was awarded through the education department's Hispanic
Serving Institutions program. The program is geared toward
universities with enrollments that are more than 25% Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Curzon said 30% of the university's 31,448 students are Latino.</TE>

<HD>Simon Feeds In His Quarters, but There Isn't Any Dial Tone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I see that in Bill Simon's case, just as in mine, the wife is the
brains of the operation.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, a political novice with millions of dollars in his pocket
and nothing to do, got it in his head to run for governor of
California on the strength of his business know-how.</LD>
<LD>   Bad move. Not only are businesses with alleged offshore tax
shelters out of favor, but then there's the small matter of
Wednesday's $78-million judgment against William E. Simon &amp; Sons for
fraud and misconduct.</LD>
<TE>   Here's where the wife comes in:</TE>
<TE>   The judgment against Simon's company was for defrauding a
businessman in the 1998 takeover of a pay phone company in Los
Angeles. Did you catch that? A pay phone company.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the fraud for a moment. What kind of boob would invest in
pay phones--in Los Angeles, of all places--in 1998? Everybody and his
brother has at least one cell phone in Southern California.
Second-graders carry them in their backpacks. Prostitutes have them.
Even homeless people. Who uses a pay phone?</TE>
<TE>   Asked that question last year by The Times, Simon admitted that
his wife, Cindy, had raised the same point.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you want to invest in a pay phone company?" he quoted her
as asking. "Nobody uses pay phones anymore."</TE>
<TE>   To which he replied:</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how much mobile phones come in, there's always going to
be a need for pay phones."</TE>
<TE>   I'm guessing that Bill "Swift" Simon, with his finger on the
zeitgeist, also plowed money into eight-track tape decks and leather
football helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Pay phones. I couldn't make up a better metaphor for a Republican
Party that's out of step with California. So my question, given the
fact that Simon appears to have fallen into a bottomless hole, is
this:</TE>
<TE>   What's Cindy doing between now and November?</TE>
<TE>   I checked with the Secretary of State, and they tell me write-in
candidates can sign up between Sept. 9 and Oct. 22. I don't know much
about Simon's wife, but she at least had the sense to realize pay
phones were out.</TE>
<TE>   Come on, Cindy. If you truly care about Bill, do him the favor of
his life and lock him in a closet. Not only is he embarrassing
himself, but this was already a one-party state without him dragging
the tattered remains of the GOP down with him.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, even if Simon quit the race, his name would still
be on the ballot. It's too late for the GOP to substitute a more
viable candidate, even though a smoldering Sequoia would stand a
better chance at this point.</TE>
<TE>   All the more reason to start a write-in campaign. If not Cindy
Simon, how about Dick Riordan or Bill Jones, the GOP primary
candidates who have to be wondering how they could possibly have lost
to this guy?</TE>
<TE>   No one has ever thrown his hands up in the middle of a race for
high office in California, says Kevin Starr, the state librarian. But
only in recent years have obscenely rich candidates with no political
experience decided they'd like to buy titles such as governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them come up through the ranks, and they've been vetted
by the press on city councils, boards of supervisors, and other
offices," says Starr. "By the time they run for higher office, both
Republican and Democrat, the public has had a look at them for 15 or
20 years."</TE>
<TE>   The worst part of Simon's self-immolation is that Gray Davis, if
he's capable of an emotion, must wake up with a smile and go skipping
around the house. Almost every day, Simon delivers another gift to
the governor's doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is the embodiment of the old saying, "I'd rather be lucky
than good." He's done nothing to distinguish himself other than turn
his office into a gold-rush museum. But he's caught more breaks than
Brad Pitt, Laker coach Phil Jackson and the last six lottery winners
combined.</TE>
<TE>   He runs for governor, and the GOP throws Dan Lungren at him.</TE>
<TE>   He runs again, having amassed an astronomical state budget
deficit, and the GOP offers up a second-rate businessman with a
country club agenda, a trail of IRS investigators and a $78-million
fraud judgment.</TE>
<TE>   We keep hearing this gospel that big government is the disease and
executive know-how the cure. Problem is, all the CEOs are being
hauled off in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Simon claims his family is clean, and promises an appeal. But he's
got another court date coming up just before the election, this one
involving his family's $40-million loss in a savings and loan company
that tanked.</TE>
<TE>   Next we'll find out that as a child, Simon swindled playmates out
of their lemonade stand and then ran it into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Simon has just hit a streak of bad luck, but one could argue
there's a pattern in his family business of taking over companies,
burying them in debt, and earning tax write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, I'd rather believe the Simons invested in the telephone
company knowing it would go south.</TE>
<TE>   What would be more frightening? That he's a shady businessman, or
that he actually thought pay phones were a growth industry?</TE>
<TE>   I made the mistake of looking at the deposition in the case, and
my mouth dropped open. At one point, a seemingly addled Simon set a
North American record for saying "you know" in one sentence. Like,
five times, you know?</TE>
<TE>   Asked at another juncture if he was involved in a meeting about

<HD>Patients May Get More Doctor Information</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Bill would require state regulators to
disclose history of malpractice settlements. It must still be
approved by the Assembly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state senator has reached a compromise with key interest groups
that would allow consumers, for the first time, to learn about
medical malpractice settlements involving their physicians from state
regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which still must clear the Assembly, would allow
patients to get a fuller picture of a doctor's legal history from the
Medical Board of California before undergoing treatment, said state
Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), the bill's author.</LD>
<LD>   Also for the first time, the board would be required to prioritize
investigations of cases in which a patient was harmed or died as a
result of perceived physician misconduct.</LD>
<TE>   The California Medical Assn., the doctors' trade group, has
complained for years that the board places more emphasis on cases
involving alternative therapies than complaints involving patient
harm.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers said the task of writing a bill was difficult because
interest groups representing consumers and doctors had divergent
goals. The Legislature is expected to pass some kind of bill this
year, because one is needed to extend the mandate of the medical
board.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very, very good about the product we have now," said
Figueroa, chairwoman of the Joint Legislative Sunset Review
Committee. "You hear about people being locked up in a room and
saying, 'This is going to be done.' That was pretty much the mind-set
with this process."</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed the Senate in May and could be heard by the
Assembly Health Committee as early as Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   During its review of the medical board, Figueroa's committee found
that most complaints filed by the public were closed without a formal
investigation, and that 65% of those who complained were dissatisfied
with its action. Also, the number of disciplinary actions taken by
the board has fallen even as complaints increased.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise bill falls short of the demands made by consumer
groups and the medical board itself, particularly in the area of
disclosure about physicians' histories.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the medical board voted to support public disclosure of
all medical malpractice settlements and misdemeanor convictions
related to physicians' qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise bill would only allow the board to publish
settlements on its Web site if a physician in a "low-risk" specialty,
such as family practice, has three or more settlements of more than
$30,000 in a 10-year period. Doctors in a "high-risk" specialty, such
as neurology, would need four or more settlements to trigger
disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The board would not be allowed to disclose the actual dollar
amount of settlements, but would instead indicate whether the
settlement is below average, average or above average compared with
other doctors in the same specialty. The bill would only apply to
settlements in the future, not in the past.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, the medical board does not disclose settlement
information; such deals are often sealed from public view.</TE>
<TE>   Misdemeanors would not be disclosed under the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates say they will continue to support the bill,
because it calls for the appointment of an independent monitor to
report on the board's disciplinary system over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   As for disclosure, "Once you get the door open, it's a little bit
easier to kick it open wider a few years from now," said Julianne
D'Angelo Fellmeth, administrative director of the Center for Public
Interest Law at the University of San Diego law school.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Whitney, the medical board's chief of legislation, said the
bill doesn't fully achieve the board's objectives.</TE>
<TE>   "This is certainly a start because it's the beginning of the
release of settlements," Whitney said. "We have never been able to
release settlements prior to this."</TE>
<TE>   The California Medical Assn. has removed its opposition to the
bill even though it would prefer that settlements not be disclosed.
Vice President Steve Thompson said the compromise will ensure that
consumers receive enough information to put them in context and not
tarnish all doctors who settle cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that is of more value to the consumer than simply
listing them all," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   But medical malpractice carriers oppose the bill, predicting it
will prompt doctors to fight in court rather than settle a case.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be disincentivized from settling a suit if he knows
it's going to go on the Web," said Dr. Wendell Moseley, a board
member of the SCPIE Companies, a malpractice carrier based in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other changes included in the compromise bill:</TE>
<TE>   * It closes loopholes that had allowed doctors to avoid reporting
settlements or legal judgments to the board.</TE>
<TE>   * It requires a physician to review a complaint from a patient
before it can be disclosed by the medical board.</TE>
<TE>   * It allows automatic revocation of a physician's license if he or
she is found guilty of certain repeat sexual crimes.</TE>
<TE>   * It adds two more public members to the board, bringing the total
membership to 21 (12 physicians and nine public members).</TE>
<TE>   * It increases the criminal penalty for unlicensed practice.</TE>

<CX>   Medical board--A story in Friday's California section incorrectly
stated that proposed legislation would require a physician to review
a consumer complaint to the medical board before it could be
"disclosed." The story should have said such review would be required

<HD>Plea Ends Nursing Home Abuse Probe</HD>
<DH>Health: Firm that runs 60 facilities in state pleads no
contest in case involving two deaths. It pledges improvements, is
fined $2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the nation's largest nursing home chains pleaded no contest
Thursday to felony elder abuse charges stemming from the deaths of
two people and promised to make wide-ranging improvements in the
quality of care at 60 facilities statewide.</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Enterprises Inc. also agreed to pay $2 million in civil
penalties for a range of violations that allegedly led to major
bedsores, dehydration, malnutrition, poor personal hygiene and
improper medication among patients from Yreka to Escondido.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which cares for more than 13,000 elderly and
dependent Californians annually, pledged to reimburse the government
for its $500,000 in investigative costs. It did not admit to
wrongdoing in the civil case.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement of criminal and civil complaints came after an
unusual two-year investigation by the California attorney general's
office and the Santa Barbara County district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office began its probe after the death of
a 102-year-old woman, Laura Simmons, who suffered from infected
bedsores at Beverly La Cumbre nursing home in Santa Barbara and had
maggots in her foot. A year later, an 87-year-old patient at the same
facility, William Marthai, died after a feeding tube was inserted
into his abdomen, outside his stomach, leading to an infection, said
Santa Barbara Assistant Dist. Atty. Tracy Grossman.</TE>
<TE>   Among the leads investigators pursued was a journal left by a La
Cumbre nurse, Mary Hochman, who had complained about conditions at
the facility and later shot and killed herself, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The journal did not have information about either of the two
patient deaths, Grossman said, but was among the evidence
investigators used to build its civil case. The company has also
settled lawsuits brought by both the Marthai and Simmons families.
Details of the settlements were not available Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Arkansas-based Beverly Health Care said the
company has begun to make improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a serious issue. We are taking it seriously, and we accept
responsibility for what occurred," said Dave Devereaux, executive
vice president. Since January 2001, he said, Beverly has "redesigned
our organization and put more resources" into the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Under the civil settlement, the corporation will be subject to
penalties of up to $6,000 per violation and could be barred from
receiving funding from Medicare and Medi-Cal if it does not comply
with reforms. In 1999, in an unrelated case, the company agreed to
reimburse the government $170 million and pay a $5-million fine to
settle allegations of Medicare fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly also agreed to increase staff training to prevent neglect,
bedsores and accidents and to treat patients with respect and
dignity, according to a summary sheet provided by the attorney
general's office. The chain pledged to have adequate staffing levels
at facilities, and to develop quality review procedures at each
facility that will make annual progress reports to the attorney
general's office.</TE>
<TE>   "The attorney general has made it a priority to see that elder
abuse is prosecuted," said spokeswoman Sandra Michioku. "He wants to
see not only individuals working at nursing homes be held
accountable, but also the businesses that make money. They need to
put the interests of our frail and elderly Californians at the top
and not just look at making money."</TE>
<TE>   Beverly has 462 facilities nationwide and 60 in California. Eleven
are in Los Angeles County, three in Orange County, two in Ventura
County and one each in San Diego and San Bernardino counties.
Beverly, which is the second-largest nursing home provider in
California, sold its La Cumbre facility in November 2001 to new
owners, who are not involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Southern California cases that drew citations are that
of an 85-year-old in Monrovia who suffered from the pain of a
dislocated shoulder for four days before receiving an X-ray, and that
of a 98-year-old Alzheimer's patient in Ventura whose leg was broken
when staff members transferred her to a wheelchair improperly.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for nursing home reform cheered the enforcement action.</TE>
<TE>   "The system is starting to work," said Prescott Cole, staff
attorney with California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. "This
breaks the pattern .... They didn't let Beverly walk away from that
disaster at La Cumbre."</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual for nursing homes to be targeted in a criminal
investigation, although state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has pledged to
pursue violations in such homes aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   Michioku said the attorney general's office got involved after
receiving a tip from a local ombudsman who advocates on behalf of
elderly patients.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara County district attorney's office began its own
investigation after a series of articles in a local newspaper. The
two agencies later joined forces.</TE>

<DH>Medicine: UCI Medical Center's new cap on treating the poor
poses question of options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps the best place to see how Orange County's health care system
for poor adults has evolved over the years is at UC Irvine Medical
Center's busy outpatient clinic in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   There, doctors last year treated 2,195 patients who qualified for
the county's Medical Services for Indigents program--people who live
in nearby public housing and people from as far as Laguna Beach. If a
doctor deemed a procedure necessary, it was done, whether the medical
center would be reimbursed by the county or not.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, doing business that way cost the clinic more than $1
million--part of the estimated $200 million UCI Medical Center has
swallowed over the past two decades serving the bulk of the county's
poor.</LD>
<TE>   "We do zero marketing," said Nancy Downey-Hurtado, the clinic's
administrator. "But over the years, when it became known that we
always take [indigent] patients, that word spread and the people
came.... In the future, it'll be different."</TE>
<TE>   One day after the medical center announced it would cap services
provided to MSI patients, it was unclear how quickly the effects of
the new policy would be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Though county officials say they're confident they will be able to
contract with other hospitals to fill the void, advocates for the
poor say the county's already inadequate indigent health care system
will be stretched to the breaking point.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there will be an impact on the emergency rooms; I
believe there will be an impact on the community clinics," said Nancy
Rimsha, director of the Health Consumer Action Center at the Legal
Aid Society of Orange County. "In some cases, the patients will go
without care, and will get sicker."</TE>
<TE>   Medical center officials announced Wednesday that they would begin
turning away all but emergency room patients who don't live within
five miles of the hospital in Orange, or two miles of its outpatient
clinics in Anaheim and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, nearly every procedure outside of primary care
visits--including preventive tests, referrals to specialists and
surgeries--now will be subject to an authorization process. That will
make the MSI system function more like private health insurance and
other government health plans for the poor, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "For patients who have come to UCI and gotten a wide array of
services [free], this is going to be quite a blow to them," said
Cindy Winner, director of ambulatory services for the medical center.
"For years, we gave away millions of dollars of services. We can no
longer afford to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Figuring out what is, and isn't, covered by MSI will be complex,
Winner said. She has developed "four or five flow charts ... with
decision trees" to help staff make decisions patient by patient.</TE>
<TE>   The MSI program covers about 20,000 uninsured people, ages 21
through 64, who earn too much to qualify for Medi-Cal or are too
young for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Patient advocates said that unless the county can add other
service providers, those hit hard by UCI Medical Center's decision
not to serve just any MSI patients will be the county's working poor
and the unemployed who aren't covered by Medi-Cal or Medicare. At the
medical center's Santa Ana and Anaheim clinics, about 75% of MSI
patients treated last year were unemployed.</TE>

<TE>   "I believe there will be an impact on the emergency rooms; I
believe there will be an impact on the community clinics," said Nancy
Rimsha, director of the Health Consumer Action Center at the Legal
Aid Society of Orange County. "In some cases, the patients will go
without care, and will get sicker."</TE>
<TE>   Medical center officials announced Wednesday that they would begin
turning away all but emergency room patients who don't live within
five miles of the hospital in Orange, or two miles of its outpatient
clinics in Anaheim and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, nearly every procedure outside of primary care
visits--including preventive tests, referrals to specialists and
surgeries--now will be subject to an authorization process. That will
make the MSI system function more like private health insurance and
other government health plans for the poor, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "For patients who have come to UCI and gotten a wide array of
services [free], this is going to be quite a blow to them," said
Cindy Winner, director of ambulatory services for the medical center.
"For years, we gave away millions of dollars of services. We can no
longer afford to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Figuring out what is, and isn't, covered by MSI will be complex,
Winner said. She has developed "four or five flow charts ... with
decision trees" to help staff make decisions patient by patient.</TE>
<TE>   The MSI program covers about 20,000 uninsured people, ages 21
through 64, who earn too much to qualify for Medi-Cal or are too
young for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Patient advocates said that unless the county can add other
service providers, those hit hard by UCI Medical Center's decision
not to serve just any MSI patients will be the county's working poor
and the unemployed who aren't covered by Medi-Cal or Medicare. At the
medical center's Santa Ana and Anaheim clinics, about 75% of MSI
patients treated last year were unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Ana clinic, Downey-Hurtado, the administrator, said
the new policy will probably lead to profound changes but will take
time to evolve--much like the present flawed system. On Thursday, for
instance, no one was turned away from her clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a long-term process," she said. "It wasn't like
one day we just said, 'We'll take everyone and will do everything MSI
doesn't cover.' I don't think it's all going to change today,
either."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, administrators at community clinics throughout they
county expect to see many of the patients the medical center turns
away, said Isabel Becerra, director of health policy for the
Coalition of Orange County Community Clinics.</TE>
<TE>   "The community clinics have always had to do more with less. We'll
try to ramp up our hours of operation," Becerra said. "If some of the
clinics can do that, they will. Otherwise, people will see longer
waiting periods for care."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Wright, 44, has been waiting to see a doctor for about a
year. Her new employer--Krispy Kreme--offers insurance, but she won't
qualify for it for several more months. For now, the MSI program will
fill in the gap.</TE>
<TE>   She has been without insurance since her divorce. It's a year in
which she has let her myriad health problems--diabetes, arthritis, a
tumor on her pituitary gland--go untreated. She heard about the MSI
program while staying at a homeless shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't take care of [the diabetes], I could lose my vision,"
Wright said Thursday as she waited to be seen by a doctor at the
Santa Ana clinic. "I was told last year I could lose my leg. Without
MSI ... it's not inconceivable that I would not have my leg at this
time next year."</TE>
<TE>   She is temporarily living in Garden Grove--outside the clinic's
two-mile radius for new patients. But because she was referred to the
clinic by the medical center's emergency room on Tuesday--before the
new policy took effect Thursday--she was able to get in, no questions
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "She went to the ER on the right day," Downey-Hurtado said. "Good
timing."</TE>

<HD>Looking at a Murder for What It Really Is</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first I thought: If there's such a thing as a poignant murder,
maybe this is it. As oxymoronic as the term sounds, this killing
sounded different than the run-of-the-mill crime when somebody shoots
somebody else.</LD>
<LD>   This one involved a father, apparently distraught over job
uncertainty, who went to pick up his 27-year-old severely autistic
son at the vocational school he attended in Mission Viejo. Instead of
bringing him home as he had done so many times before, the father
shot and killed his son as they sat in the family van in the school
parking lot. The father then shot and killed himself.</LD>
<LD>   The armchair psychologist in me leaped into mental action. What
kind of pressures, however unintended, must the son have brought to
bear on his parents? Caring for severely disabled children,
especially for so many years, must take a tremendous toll. And
although 55-year-old Delfin Bartolome had reportedly become more
despondent over his job security, it was only Dale--the eldest of his
three sons--whom he took with him to eternity. In Delfin Bartolome's
suicidal depression, did he somehow think he was sparing someone from
something by killing Dale, as well?</LD>
<TE>   I'm now leaving those questions behind, feeling I was asking the
wrong questions while walking down the wrong path.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing very poignant about killing another human being, a
point driven home Thursday by Kathryn Hebel, the executive director
of Vocational Visions, the school that Dale Bartolome attended.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the murder-suicide, the traumatic aftermath of
the incident reverberates throughout the school, Hebel says. On any
given day, the school has about 120 developmentally disabled people
on site and another 100 at area work sites. Some, but not all, of
them will realize Dale is dead and will grieve in their own way. Some
staffers have not returned to work because of their grief. One thing
that Hebel refuses to do is rationalize the taking of Dale's life. On
that count, she deserves to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   In a soft, level voice, she decries what she feels might be a
perception that disabled people are burdens on society or those close
to them.</TE>
<TE>   Hebel and her staff don't see burdens. "What we see are inspiring
individuals who go through life challenged but with determination,"
she says. They see people who, at heart, want to give and not take
and who have collected pennies for a Kiwanis Club charity or hold
jobs at a variety of businesses in Orange County. And people who,
perhaps in ways that some of us don't understand, exult and despair
over life's vicissitudes.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Hebel says, they are people who bring their own value to
American life and to their families. It isn't true, she says, that
families typically feel burdened by raising a child with severe
disabilities. There certainly is stress--it would be dishonest to
sugarcoat it--but those same disabled people often bring great joy to
their parents or loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the human value of each individual or personality," Hebel
says, "and to take that life for any reason is unfathomable to us."</TE>
<TE>   She has extended her sympathies to the Bartolome family and takes
pains not to condemn Delfin Bartolome. Her concern, she says, is only
that Dale Bartolome's death be seen for what it was--a murder--and
not as something more benign.</TE>
<TE>   Delfin Bartolome's motive died with him. His 27-year-old nephew,
Roger Mationg, said on Thursday: "It's as much a mystery today as the
day it happened. We're talking about it, yeah, but we don't have any
real insights as to why it happened."</TE>
<TE>   Mationg says he never had the impression that Delfin saw his son
as an immense burden nor that he felt unduly weighed down in caring
for him with his wife. "I can't give you any more conjectures," he
said, politely and softly.</TE>
<TE>   Nor should he be asked for any. Nor should we guess at why Delfin
Bartolome did what he did. Nor try to soften it.</TE>
<TE>   He took a life of someone of value, of someone who will be missed
by those who knew him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find a silver lining," Hebel says. "We don't
think there was one. We're dealing with the death of Dale now."</TE>

<HD>Valencia Firm Accused of Selling Faulty Plane Parts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Valencia company and two of its officers were indicted by a federal
grand jury Thursday on charges of lying about the quality of
electrical parts the company sold for military and civilian aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   RAM Enterprises Inc. sold government contractors inferior and
counterfeit electrical connector pins that cracked or corroded after
being installed in airplanes.</LD>
<LD>   A safety alert was issued when the problem came to light, and all
of the defective pins were removed from affected aircraft and
inventories, the U.S. attorney's office said.</LD>
<TE>   A prosecution spokesman said the pins were installed in a variety
of planes, including the F-16 fighter jet, the KC-135 air tanker and
the C-130 transport plane.</TE>
<TE>   Named in the three-count indictment were RAM Enterprises; Richard
A. Monstein, its president; and Timothy Gordon, the company's quality
director.</TE>
<TE>   Monstein, 50, of Agua Dulce said Thursday, "This comes as a
complete surprise to me."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Monstein and Gordon, 57, of Canyon Country face maximum sentences
of 15 years in prison plus fines of up to $750,000 if convicted. The
company could be fined up to $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned later this month in
Los Angeles federal court.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, RAM Enterprises bought electrical
pins of varying quality from different suppliers. It also
manufactured some pins.</TE>
<TE>   If the company did not have government-requested brands in stock,
it would substitute those of lesser quality and lie about the source,
the indictment said.</TE>

<HD>Hearst May Undergo Mental Evaluation</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defense in 1975 slaying case is expected to seek
psychiatric tests of prosecution witness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>There is no forgetting her name or the waxen face--beret on head,
carbine in hand. Patty Hearst, the abducted newspaper heiress turned
gun-toting terrorist, remains a dark emblem of a revolutionary era.</LD>
<LD>   Now she's being pulled back to that time and called upon to
revisit its horrors.</LD>
<LD>   Hearst is the prosecution's presumptive star witness in a case
against four old comrades in arms, members of a violent
anti-establishment band who called themselves the Symbionese
Liberation Army. The defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges
relating to a 1975 robbery and slaying at a Crocker National Bank
branch in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-eight years after her kidnapping, after a book, a cameo
acting career, a presidential pardon and much time nurturing a
family, Hearst would seem the perfect witness for the
prosecution--articulate, poised and patrician, ready to tell all the
grim old tales.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys, intent on discrediting her testimony, have
a very different Patty Hearst in mind. They intend to portray her as
a woman steeped in suspect recollections. Her brief term as Tania,
the SLA's brainwashed radical addition, induced a trauma that shadows
her to this day, they argue, undercutting her fitness as prime
witness against the SLA foursome.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing today, defense attorneys are expected to ask a
Sacramento Superior Court judge to order that Hearst be examined by a
psychiatrist. The lawyers also want access to all her mental-health
records compiled since the SLA days.</TE>
<TE>   What they hope to undercut is Chapter 15.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the fifteenth chapter of Hearst's 1982
autobiography, "Every Secret Thing." In damning detail, it recounts
the events of the bank robbery and shotgun murder of Myrna Opsahl, a
42-year-old mother of four who had just arrived at the bank,
intending to count church receipts.</TE>
<TE>   The book tells how William Harris, one of the four former SLA
members on trial, waited outside. It suggests that Sara Jane Olson,
Michael Bortin and Emily Harris all entered the bank, masks or
disguises in place. The chapter states that Emily Harris shot Opsahl.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst, who admits she drove a getaway car, recounts in the book
that Emily Harris rationalized afterward that Opsahl had been "a
bourgeois pig anyway."</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, attorneys for the former SLA members note that
Hearst, now 48, said she had been traumatized by the ordeal of her
captivity and had cited her mental state as a defense at her own 1976
trial for a San Francisco bank robbery with the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   A 19-year-old UC Berkeley student when she was kidnapped, Hearst
spent more than 50 days locked in a closet. Her defense attorneys
argued 26 years ago that she succumbed to "Stockholm Syndrome," a
state of mind that turned her into an unwitting pawn of her captors.
Several psychiatrists and psychologists who examined Hearst for the
case concluded that the brainwashing and traumatic months on the run
had left her impaired, burdened by "patchy amnesia." Gaps in her
memory, they said, had been filled with what she had heard from
others.</TE>
<TE>   "No one thinks she's crazy. We're trying to get an examination to
see what her memory is like," said Stuart Hanlon, an attorney on the
SLA defense team. "If she's not believed, they don't have a case."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors counter in court briefs that Hanlon and the defense
have produced no evidence suggesting that Hearst has a current mental
condition that would impair her testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Today's anticipated court fight is merely "the first of what is
expected to be many motions designed to discredit, dissuade and
ultimately harass" the government's key witness, argued prosecutors
Rob Gold and Mark Curry. "Ms. Hearst, who has been interrogated,
interviewed, examined and cross-examined possibly more than any
witness in the history of criminal jurisprudence, has already
recounted literally thousands of details surrounding the time period
in question."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst is not expected to appear during today's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyer says Patricia Hearst Shaw--Shaw is the name she has
used since her marriage more than two decades ago to former bodyguard
Bernard Shaw--retains vivid memories of her SLA days.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a mind like a steel trap," said George Martinez, a
Tiburon attorney who has represented Hearst since the late 1970s.
"She's a very bright, self-assured woman. She's raised good children.
She's gotten on with life. But that doesn't mean she'll forget what
happened. You don't forget things like that."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst served nearly two years in prison after her conviction for
robbing the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco with the SLA. The robbery
provided the surveillance shot of Hearst carrying a semiautomatic
carbine--one of the iconic images of the 1970s. In 1979, her sentence
was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. She was pardoned by President
Bill Clinton on his last day in office.</TE>
<TE>   For the past 20 years she has lived mostly a quiet life, raising
her two daughters, now 21 and 17, in Fairfield County, an affluent
Connecticut enclave. Hearst does charity work and avoids political
activity.</TE>
<TE>   She forged a minor acting career in independent films, becoming a
celebrity in the gay community as part of the informal repertory of
satirical filmmaker John Waters. She appeared in films such as
"Cry-Baby," "Serial Mom," "Pecker" and "Cecil B. DeMented."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst also proved willing to probe her famous grandfather's
storied past, serving as host for a two-hour cable documentary on San
Simeon, the palatial home built by William Randolph Hearst on a
coastal hilltop in central California. Reared in San Francisco,
Hearst visited the castle as a weekend retreat in her childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Her past with the SLA, seemingly behind her, boomeranged with the
June 1999 arrest of Sara Jane Olson, the pseudonym adopted by SLA
member Kathleen Soliah, who had reinvented herself as a Minnesota
soccer mom during 25 years in hiding.</TE>
<TE>   By her own account, Hearst was slated to be a reluctant witness
when Olson was tried on charges of planting bombs, which failed to go
off, under several Los Angeles police cars.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep trying to forget these people," Hearst was quoted saying
in Talk magazine. "And they keep dragging me back into it!"</TE>
<TE>   After the arrests in the Opsahl slaying, Hearst presented a
different face. She appeared on "Larry King Live," calling Opsahl's
murder a "violent, senseless, evil act" and suggested she had no
qualms about testifying against her erstwhile comrades.</TE>
<TE>   "They just don't have any power over me anymore," she added. "They
haven't had for years."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, however, suggest that there remains every
reason to question Hearst's memories.</TE>
<TE>   "There exists numerous documents that illustrate that Ms. Hearst
suffered from a mental illness that affected, and may still affect,
her ability to accurately recall and relate the events," the defense
said in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Mental-health experts say there is little doubt that traumatic
events do often impair people's recollections. It is called
"disassociated amnesia," said Michael Mantell, a 30-year law
enforcement psychologist in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   But for some people, the trauma can recede and the memories come
rolling back, he said, "like they're coming out of a fog."</TE>

<HD>No-Show at Trial Costs the County $12 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRET THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has ordered Los Angeles County to pay $12.3 million in
damages to the plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit after the
county's private attorney failed for three days to show up for trial.</LD>
<LD>   Veronica Oliveros, who sued after suffering brain damage while at
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for heart surgery, won the judgment on the
fourth day.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney George Peterson initially had asked that the
trial be delayed while he attended to another trial. Superior Court
Judge Josh M. Fredericks refused, ordering the malpractice case to go
forward. But Peterson never appeared.</LD>
<TE>   On the fourth day, when the judge decided that the jury inevitably
would decide in Oliveros' favor, he ordered a verdict against the
county and the $12.3-million penalty. The county is appealing the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   With the county facing a $800-million deficit in its system of
hospitals and clinics, the loss of $12 million "is pretty
outrageous," said Miguel Santana, spokesman for Supervisor Gloria
Molina. "How many clinics could we keep open with $12 million?"</TE>
<TE>   Peterson works for the law firm of Bonne, Bridges, Mueller,
O'Keefe &amp; Nichols, which has received nearly $500,000 in fees from
the county over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Miller, deputy county counsel, said the judge's decision not
to delay the trial while Peterson worked on his other case violated
the government's right to due process. In a letter to the Board of
Supervisors, Lloyd Pellman, county counsel, said the malpractice case
was too complex to be reassigned to another defense attorney on short
notice.</TE>
<TE>   However, Oliveros' attorney, Rolando Hidalgo, told the court that
other attorneys at Peterson's firm had worked on the case and would
be capable of handling the trial during the early stages.</TE>
<TE>   "Some defense firm thought they were above the law, and the court
told them they weren't," Hidalgo said. "Hundreds of hours went into
this case, and for them to thumb their nose at the process was not
appreciated."</TE>
<TE>   Oliveros, 30, suffered brain damage while at Harbor-UCLA for
surgery to replace one of her heart valves in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Hidalgo said she awoke from surgery and removed a ventilator that
was irritating her. The resulting loss of oxygen, he said, damaged
her brain. He alleges that nurses improperly decided not to place
restraints on Oliveros' arms.</TE>

<HD>DNA Leads to Arrest in Santa Ana Girl's Rape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DNA evidence left at the scene of the kidnapping and rape of a Santa
Ana girl two years ago has led prosecutors to charge a Northern
California man with the crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Mario Antonio Hernandez, 44, a migrant farm worker from Redwood
City, was charged Thursday with kidnap, rape, oral copulation and
child molestation in the attack on the 9-year-old girl, who was
abducted as she rode her bicycle in front of her home on April 22,
2000.</LD>
<LD>   According to authorities, Hernandez used a ruse to approach the
girl and took her to a construction site three blocks away, where he
attacked her and then fled. If convicted on all counts, prosecutors
say, he could face life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an excellent use of our state DNA database," said Camille
Hill, the Orange County deputy district attorney handling the case.
"It's one of the first instances of linking crimes and then finding
the perpetrator." Based on the DNA evidence, Hill said, investigators
linked the Santa Ana rape case to at least five similar ones in
Northern California between March 19, 2000, and April 7, 2002--two of
them in Redwood City.</TE>
<TE>   But they weren't able to identify the perpetrator, she said, until
after an arrest this year in one of the Redwood City cases, allowing
forensic scientists to draw the suspect's blood. A state Department
of Justice scientist matched Hernandez's DNA profile to those found
in all the other cases, including the Orange County rape.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said she didn't know in what order the cases would be
prosecuted, or when Hernandez would be brought to Orange County for
trial.</TE>

<LD>Authorities have seized seven marijuana gardens spread across 10
acres, the second such raid in Madera County in a month.</LD>
<LD>   A tipster led officials to 4,194 budding plants, authorities said.
The gardens, with fertilizer and drip irrigation system valued at
about $13 million, were destroyed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It looked like these guys had been trained in the vineyards,"
said a sheriff's spokeswoman, Erica Stuart. "There was so much care
and detail put into these groves."</LD>
<TE>   No suspects were arrested, and the gardens appeared to have been
abandoned, Stuart said.</TE>
<TE>   Litter was scattered throughout the area, and authorities found
four sleeping bags and beer cans with bullet holes. Food supplies at
the site appeared to have been ripped open by bears.</TE>
<TE>   On July 21, police seized a pot garden in rural Ahwahnee with more
than 300 plants valued at about $1.1 million. Remijio Delamora, 65,
of Merced and Eliseo Olivera, 48, of Rosemead were arrested on
suspicion of cultivating marijuana for sale.</TE>

<HD>Mythical Sea Wolf Is In, Cossack Out as Mascot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonoma State University on Thursday introduced its new mascot--the
sea wolf.</LD>
<LD>   The mythical creature, with a connection to novelist Jack London,
replaces the Cossack, which school officials deemed inappropriate.
Cossacks have been viewed in history as either anti-Semitic
barbarians or courageous Russian cavalrymen who defended the border
against such invaders as Napoleon.</LD>
<LD>   The debate over whether to change the mascot has been going on
since the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   The mascot selection committee included students, alumni and
athletes. The runner-up to the sea wolf was the condor.</TE>
<TE>   University President Ruben Arminana said the new mascot was
appropriate for the university.</TE>
<TE>   The university houses much of London's original work and is just
miles from his former home in Glen Ellen, Calif.</TE>

<HD>Secession Bad for Valley Blacks, Study Says</HD>

<LD>African Americans in the San Fernando Valley would lose political
clout if the region seceded, while blacks in the remainder of Los
Angeles would probably not gain influence at City Hall, according to
a study commissioned by county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.</LD>
<LD>   The study by UCLA urban planning professor Eugene Grigsby also
found that the Valley and Los Angeles would face financial problems
after a breakup, which could harm African Americans more than other
residents.</LD>
<LD>   "This report will be valuable because, among other things, I
believe there was not enough study done on all the financial
implications of a breakup," Burke said Thursday. "A breakup of this
magnitude has never been tried before anywhere."</LD>
<TE>   Grigsby and Burke will present a draft of the findings today in a
closed-door meeting with African American leaders, including former
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald
(D-Carson) and the Rev. Cecil Murray of the First AME Church.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists disputed many of Grigsby's findings. They
also said African Americans are not well served by City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The northeast Valley, where many African Americans live, "has been
ignored by City Hall more than most communities," said Richard Katz,
co-chairman of the Valley Independence Committee. "They aren't
getting their fair share today."</TE>
<TE>   The study examined financial and demographic material from the
city, the Census Bureau and the Local Agency Formation Commission,
the panel that analyzed the secession proposal and placed it on the
Nov. 5 ballot. Grigsby did not look at the effect of Hollywood
secession, which is also on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The professor said he found that African Americans in the Valley
would not likely be a major force in any of the 14 proposed city
council districts because they would make up just 4.5% of the
population.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be virtually no possibility of having political
influence," Grigsby said.</TE>
<TE>   In the remainder of Los Angeles, Grigsby found, the African
American population would increase from 11.1% to 14.9%. But because
so many blacks live in South Los Angeles, where there have been big
increases in the Latino population, it is "questionable" whether the
influence of African Americans in downtown politics would grow, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because their proportion goes up, the area they reside in
doesn't change," Grigsby said.</TE>
<TE>   African Americans now represent three of the 15 Los Angeles City
Council districts, but have significant voter strength in just two of
those. Grigsby said secession would probably not result in a third
district where blacks are the largest voting bloc.</TE>
<TE>   Katz disagreed. He said the study underestimated the relatively
high voter registration rates of African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Katz also rejected Grigsby's finding that Los Angeles would be
forced to reduce services after secession, and that the cuts would
hurt blacks disproportionately because they make up a large
percentage of the city's work force.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Grigsby said secession would weaken Los Angeles'
ability to secure federal and state money for social services,
because the city would no longer be the nation's second-largest. Katz
disputed that claim as well.</TE>

<HD>Gang Member Is Sought in Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: Arrest warrant is issued for the Oxnard man in the
shooting of a 22-year-old Port Hueneme woman.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard gang member with a history of domestic violence convictions
has been named as the suspect in the shooting death of a Port Hueneme
woman one week ago.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with an arrest warrant, Ventura police continued their
search Thursday for Harold Edward Marshall, 32.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators believe Marshall shot Irene Imelda Mata, 22, once in
the head as the two sat in a car in the 3000 block of Bunsen Avenue,
next to the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   Mata's body was found July 26 in the front passenger seat of the
1991 Chevy Camaro.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police the car rear-ended an abandoned van after
the shooting, and that a man was seen running from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Police Lt. Doug Auldridge said Marshall and Mata were
involved in a romantic relationship, and that the motive for the
shooting was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe that Marshall is in Oxnard with family or
friends.</TE>
<TE>   An eight-hour search was conducted for the gunman using
bloodhounds, SWAT officers and sheriff's helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   Auldridge said detectives have interviewed Marshall's mother on
several occasions and have asked for assistance from the public
through the Crime Stoppers hotline.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall is described as 6 feet 2 with a teardrop tattoo under his
left eye and lettering tattooed on the left and right side of his
neck.</TE>
<TE>   He has served more than a year in Ventura County Jail and state
prison in connection with multiple child and spousal abuse
convictions in Ventura and Oxnard, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Although police believe the gun found at the scene was used in the
shooting, they still consider Marshall armed and dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The warrant carries a $750,000 bail, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty.
Richard Simon said.</TE>

<HD>Attorney Has the Last Word in Book Dispute</HD>
<DH>After firm reneged on deal to print the volume over fears
that it might not sell, Rafael Chodos sued. He won on appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Financial disputes have been the mainstay of Woodland Hills attorney
Rafael Chodos' law practice for the last two decades.</LD>
<LD>   That's why he wasn't reluctant to engage in a legal battle of his
own when the West Group backed out of a contract to publish his
1,600-page tome on fiduciary duties.With the help of his brother and
nephew, both of whom also are experienced business litigators, Chodos
took the giant Minnesota-based legal publisher to court.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit could serve as a case study for a lawbook. The lesson:
Don't take on a lawyer in a legal dispute.</LD>
<TE>   "Most authors don't have the moxie to sue their publisher," Chodos
said. "But I do this for a living."</TE>
<TE>   In June, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that West
had breached the agreement with Chodos and that he could seek
restitution for the three years he spent on the book. Taking into
account his hourly rate as an attorney, Chodos is asking for more
than a million dollars in damages, nearly 10 times what he had
expected to be paid under the contract.</TE>
<TE>   To make Chodos' victory even sweeter, West's business includes
publishing appellate rulings from across the nation--so it will have
to print the decision in its own extensive databases.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was 14 years ago that Chodos first got the idea to write an
authoritative book on the laws that govern fiduciary duties--the
obligations that arise when a person holds something in trust for
another.</TE>
<TE>   He noticed how common fiduciary duties are in everyday life and
how difficult it sometimes is to know who is in the right in a
dispute. Fiduciary duties, unlike contractual obligations, are "vague
and fuzzy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you are an employee or an agent or a spouse or a
[business] partner--any of those relationships implies fiduciary
duty," he said. "Sometimes, it's not quite clear what the fiduciary
is supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Chodos initially signed a contract for his book with
Bancroft-Whitney in 1995. The firm was later acquired by West.</TE>
<TE>   During the years he was writing, Chodos says he shut down most of
his legal practice and often rose at 4 a.m. to work on the book. "I
wanted to have a quieter life and time to focus on this, because I
thought it was my mission," he said. After Chodos submitted a final
manuscript, West said that it would not publish it because of
concerns about its "market potential," according to the appellate
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It just came down to simple economics," West spokesman Kyle
Christensen said of the publisher's move. "The company felt that no
one would buy it."</TE>
<TE>   Chodos sued in early 1999, soon after his manuscript was rejected.
A district judge sided with West, ruling that the publisher had the
discretion to decline to publish. But Chodos and his familial legal
team pressed on.</TE>
<TE>   In its decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel
overturned the lower court's decision, holding that the contract
allowed West to reject the manuscript only if the "form and content"
of the work were unacceptable, not for economic reasons alone. The
court noted that the publisher agreed that Chodos' writing was of
"high quality."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Jassin, a New York-based publishing attorney, predicts the
ruling will make publishers more cautious when forming and
terminating contracts. "They're going to put provisions in their
contracts that give them the right to terminate for changed market
conditions," Jassin said.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of restitution remains to be determined in court. West
declined to comment on that aspect of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Under the contract, Chodos was to receive a 15% royalty. Bancroft
editors had told him a successful title typically grosses $1 million,
Chodos said.</TE>
<TE>   Chodos contends that he is now owed up to $1.4 million for 3,600
hours' work--calculated using his hourly rate as a lawyer of $300 to
$400--because he has been deprived of other expected benefits, such
as an enhanced professional reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "If West had gone ahead and published the book, I would have been
quite happy with $150,000 in royalties," he said. "When they blew the
contract away, the correct measure for my damages at that point
became ... the value of the time I spent writing."</TE>
<TE>   Chodos also decided to publish "The Law of Fiduciary Duties"
himself. He formed Blackthorne Legal Press and hired a copy editor,
designer and printer.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an imposing-looking volume bound in a dark blue
leather cover that vaguely resembles a religious tome.</TE>
<TE>   It dissects the fiduciary duties of corporate director toward
shareholder, doctor toward patient, public official toward
constituent, and the reciprocal duties of husband and wife and
business partners, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Chodos' prose is peppered with references to hundreds of
California court cases dating back to the 1850s. Distilled versions
of the cases are found at the end of the book.</TE>
<TE>   Tamar Frankel, a Boston University law professor who specializes
in fiduciary duty, said Chodos has created a useful reference tool
for attorneys looking for cases to bolster their arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very efficient method of finding what you want, which
may otherwise be a needle in a haystack," Frankel said. She added
that a CD-ROM version of the book, which contains hypertext links to
summaries of cited cases, is especially helpful.</TE>
<TE>   The book also contains a section of fairy tales rewritten by
Chodos to illustrate legal arguments.</TE>
<TE>   In "Jack and the Beanstalk," Jack's estranged sister sues him for
half of the golden eggs laid by the goose Jack snatched from the
ogre. Jack's sister contends the eggs are part of the estate of their
mother, who has died.</TE>
<TE>   The sister argues that Jack was acting as his mother's agent when
he traded her cow for the magic beans and that any benefit he gained
from the resulting beanstalk does not belong to him alone, but to all
of his mother's heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Chodos, who believes that Jack should get most of the eggs because
of his "extraordinary efforts [in] exploiting the beanstalk for his
own benefit," plans to finish a book of legal fairy tales later this
year. But he hasn't yet decided who he'll approach to publish it.</TE>
<TE>   And he's not ruling out working with West.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very angry that West, which is supposed to be a guardian of
the law, treated [my book] so badly," he said. "But no matter how
great I am at marketing and selling my book, they are probably 100
times better."</TE>

<HD>Cardenas a Shoo-In for Seat on Council</HD>
<DH>Politics: Experts say the state legislator faces no serious
challengers for redrawn 6th District post in the northeast Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For termed-out Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, who lost a Los Angeles City
Council election last spring, a new council district in the northeast
San Fernando Valley could be his consolation prize.</LD>
<LD>   With the nonpartisan primary election seven months away, Cardenas
has raised more than $50,000, his campaign says. And he faces no
serious challengers for the open seat, which was created July 1 to
give more clout to Valley Latinos and Latino politicians such as
Cardenas.</LD>
<LD>   Three other candidates have filed papers with the city Ethics
Commission to run for the council's 6th District seat. As of
Thursday, however, two of them said they were pulling out because
they live outside the new boundaries. One candidate remains, but has
indicated that he plans to raise less than $1,000 this year.</LD>
<TE>   In March, Cardenas lost his bid to represent the 2nd District in
the eastern San Fernando Valley. First-time candidate Wendy Greuel, a
film studio executive, beat him by 242 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, a Democrat who lives in Panorama City, now wants to
represent a Valley district that, until July 1, encompassed Los
Angeles' Westside: Venice, Marina del Rey and areas around Los
Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Because of demographic shifts uncovered by the 2000 census,
council members voted to move the 6th District and its term-limited
councilwoman, Ruth Galanter, to the predominantly Latino northeast
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The new 6th District includes all or parts of North Hollywood, Van
Nuys, Panorama City, Sun Valley and Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates for the seven City Council seats on the March 2003
primary ballot and the May 2003 general election have until early
November to enter the race, but observers of Valley politics predict
that the 6th District will be Cardenas' for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   "The demography of this district favors the election of a Latino
... and Tony is the most prominent Latino looking at the race," said
Larry Levine, a Valley political strategist. "He's got the ability to
raise the resources and marshal the troops."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas could not be reached Thursday, but his communications
director, Josh Pulliam, said the three-term assemblyman's record in
the Valley and Sacramento, along with his name recognition, should
fend off challengers.</TE>
<TE>   But, Pulliam added, whether the Valley should become its own city
is the dominant political question now. Once that's answered, he
said, next year's ballot might look different.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters have a lot to think about in November," Pulliam said.
"The next City Council is about the last thing on anybody's mind
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas opposes Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   Finance reports filed this week reveal that many of Cardenas'
early contributors live and do business outside of his district;
Beverly Hills, Calabasas, San Jose and Chicago are among the
addresses.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas received $1,000 from former U.S. Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and his wife, who live in San
Antonio. He also received $500 donations--the maximum--from unions
representing plumbers and food workers, and $250 from a union of
sprinkler fitters.</TE>
<TE>   In separate filings, he reported $244,000 in debts from his
campaign against Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter's deputy chief of staff, Mike Bonin, and Venice resident
Sandra Bernard had planned to run for Galanter's seat before it was
uprooted. Both said Thursday that they are no longer running.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Jose Bonilla of Arleta as Cardenas' only challenger.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating that the San Fernando Valley might become its own
city, Bonilla is also a candidate for a council seat in the new city,
according to papers he filed with the ethics commission.</TE>
<TE>   For L.A.'s council, Bonilla has filed a form indicating that he
does not expect to raise or spend more than $1,000 on his campaign
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bonilla could not be reached Thursday.</TE>

<LD>Blood-stained clothes worn by a Simi Valley man suggest that he was
hit at close range but with minimal force, a crime scene expert
testified Thursday in the trial of the man's wife and stepdaughter.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Childs, 37, and her daughter, Jennifer Childs, 19, are
accused of trying to kill 57-year-old Larry Childs by setting fire to
his bed and then beating him with baseball bats.</LD>
<LD>   They are each charged with attempted murder, arson and the use of
deadly weapons. Eileen Childs faces added child endangerment charges
because her sons were in the house at the time of the March fire.</LD>
<TE>   "The striking would be little bitty jabs versus a large baseball
swing," said Edwin Jones, a Ventura County forensic scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend the mother and daughter conspired to kill
Larry Childs to collect on $1.4 million in life insurance.</TE>

<LD>A rollover collision and a fire caused onlooker traffic backups for
at least five miles along the Ventura Freeway for most of Thursday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   A three-vehicle collision at the Santa Clara River Bridge between
Oxnard and Ventura helped stall southbound traffic on the freeway
starting about 1 p.m. but caused no serious injuries, California
Highway Patrol officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A two-acre fire near the Ventura River Bridge was reported about
1:30 p.m. and kept city of Ventura firefighters busy the rest of the
afternoon. No injuries or damage was reported, and the fire was under
control by 5 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   The Ventura County Fair, on the second day of a 12-day run, may
have also added vehicles to the freeway's afternoon traffic,
authorities said.</TE>

<HD>It Might Be Cliche, but It's Another Game Closer to the
Playoffs for Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Because Angel Manager Mike Scioscia barely even acknowledges the fact
that there are any more games scheduled beyond tonight, we'll break
the New York Yankee series down for him: Thursday night's game was
the one they had to win.</LD>
<LD>   If you're going to focus on one game, then it's smart to focus on
the one in which you're facing Jeff Weaver. He had given up 24 runs
and nine homers in 29 innings since the Yankees traded for him.</LD>
<LD>   It sure wouldn't make sense to worry about winning a series from a
team that had hadn't lost one since June, with a record of 7-0-3 in
its last 10 series. Especially with Andy Pettitte, Orlando "El Duque"
Hernandez and David Wells (and their ERAs of 3.53, 3.31 and 3.66)
coming up next. Too daunting.</LD>
<TE>   But they awake this morning one-up on the Yankees in this
four-game set.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver gave up only two runs Thursday night. But he did serve up
another home run, this one to Brad Fullmer, and that turned out to be
the difference in the Angels' 2-1 victory in the first game of the
series ... I mean, the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about a series, we're talking about a game,"
Scioscia said. "That's where our focus is. That's where we're going
to apply ourselves. We're not looking at a four-game series with the
Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   Today, tonight, right here, right now. Those are the themes
Scioscia keeps hammering home, and it's working. By staying focused
on the present, they've stayed in the hunt in the division and
wild-card races. They didn't abandon the season when they started off
6-14, they didn't fret when closer Troy Percival went to the disabled
list during a crucial stretch of games.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia's so low-key, not a lot of things jump out about him. But
this one emphasis is becoming his trademark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's big," shortstop David Eckstein said. "If you start looking
down the road, without fully concentrating on what you're doing that
night, you're bound to have lapses. Taking it one game at a time it
eases that pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds so simple. Take the most overused cliche in sports, turn it
into a mantra and proceed to rack up victories. What it lacks in
creativity, it makes up with results.</TE>
<TE>   "I just really believe in that short focus," Scioscia said. "If
you talk to Dusty Baker--I talk to Bake about this a lot--Bake's big
on looking at clumps of games and saying, 'We really should target
these games [as games] we're going to win.' It's been very successful
for him. I don't do it that way. Our philosophy is the one game we're
playing right here and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Next, Scioscia needs to experiment with cloning, because this game
was almost a genetic blueprint for a perfect Angel victory: Great
starting pitching from Jarrod Washburn (four hits and one run in
seven innings). Darin Erstad hustling to advance two bases on a bloop
single by Tim Salmon, then Garret Anderson taking care of business
with a sacrifice fly. Solid defense all around. A 1-2-3 save for
Percival in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   They stuck to their ways, they weren't deterred by the Yankees,
their powerful lineup or their legions of fans.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to do this is go out and play," Scioscia said.
"We're certainly not intimidated by anybody that would come in here,
or any city we go in and play. We respect them, we know they're an
incredible team, but our confidence level is very, very high."</TE>
<TE>   With the Yankees, confidence comes with the pinstripes. It also
filters down from the front office, which has the authorization to
make whatever big acquisitions it has to during the season, with
money not a factor.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels don't operate that way, and their players can't feel
the executives will do anything possible to help them.</TE>
<TE>   You didn't hear them pestering reporters about trade rumors before
the deadline, because it would probably only set them up for a
letdown. It passed with no major changes in the clubhouse, and the
Angels went about their business.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I was caught off-guard when Adam Kennedy walked up and
asked: "What do you think about the trade?"</TE>
<TE>   What trade? Was there some last-minute deadline deal I missed? He
couldn't be talking about the Angels sending Jorge Fabregas to
Milwaukee for Alex Ochoa, could he? Was that one even worth
analyzing?</TE>
<TE>   Sensing the confusion, he clarified: "The trade the Clippers
made."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, that trade. Like it a lot. Andre Miller is one of the top five
point guards in the NBA. Kennedy likes it too, although he said: "I
hate to see Darius Miles go."</TE>
<TE>   As if paying tribute to Miles, Kennedy made a highlight play in
the sixth inning, with his diving stop to rob Bernie Williams of a
hit.</TE>
<TE>   A day after making a costly error against Boston, Troy Glaus was
locked in at third base. With two outs, one run in and runners on
first and third in the top of the seventh, he hopped across the line
to nab a grounder by Alfonso Soriano and gunned it over to
first--even though the umpire called it foul. So when Soriano ripped
a shot toward the hole a couple of pitches later, Glaus grabbed that
one and fired to second for the forceout.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Glaus' bat is coming around as well. He followed up
Wednesday's homer with two hits in four at-bats. They've been doing a
lot of this without Glaus. If he can round into form, the Angels get
that much better, Anderson gets more dangerous in the spot ahead of
him, the Angels get that much closer to the playoffs ...</TE>
<TE>   Excuse me, to tonight's game against the Yankees.</TE>

<HD>Everett Makes Red Sox Pay for Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl Everett would rather not talk about having a career night
against the Boston Red Sox--even though they traded him in the
off-season.</LD>
<LD>   Everett hit a grand slam and a three-run homer--and nearly homered
twice more--in the Rangers' 19-7 rout of the Red Sox on Thursday
night at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really not trying to beat them more than any other team,"
said Everett, who finished with a career-high seven runs batted in.</LD>
<TE>   "The people who were there that didn't want me aren't there
anymore so it's not that big a deal. I was pretty close to some of
those guys. We won, that's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Everett, who has six homers in his last seven games, just missed
doing it again in the third and fifth innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure, playing against the Red Sox, he was locked in, but I
didn't see anything any different," Ranger Manager Jerry Narron said.
"He plays hard every night."</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 467th career homer in the eighth inning to
pass Willie Stargell and Stan Musial for 20th on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hollandsworth added a three-run homer for his first AL home
run, and drove in four runs in his first game for Texas after being
acquired from Colorado in a deadline deal Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Lamb and Kevin Mench also homered for Texas, and Ivan
Rodriguez and Michael Young had three hits each.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers set season highs for runs and homers (six) a day after
they had a season-best 21 hits in a 17-6 beating of the New York
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Floyd, acquired by the Red Sox on Tuesday in a trade with
Montreal, went two for three with two walks in his first game with
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Chan Ho Park (4-5) had a 16-1 lead after three innings and picked
up his first victory since June 23 before leaving because of a
blister on the middle finger of his right hand.</TE>
<TE>   Park, who had four no-decisions and two losses during the drought,
struck out nine and walked three.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers put together a six-run first inning against John
Burkett (10-4).</TE>
<TE>   Burkett gave up eight runs and six hits over 1 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Castillo didn't fare much better, giving up 10 runs and 11
hits over 3 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was just a terrible game and an embarrassment," said
Burkett, who pitched a four-hit shutout against Baltimore in his
previous start. "I couldn't have gotten a Texas high school team out,
let alone the Texas Rangers. I ended up putting Frank [Castillo] in a
bad position and he wound up taking one for the team."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 10, Cleveland 6--Ben Davis' three-run homer capped a
six-run sixth inning as the Mariners overcame a five-run deficit to
beat the Indians at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners came from behind to win for the fourth consecutive
game in their first meeting with Cleveland since eliminating the
Indians in Game 5 of their AL division series last season.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Nelson (2-2) got the victory with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless
relief of Joel Pineiro. Sean DePaula (1-1) came in and walked Mike
Cameron before Davis homered to give him a career-tying four RBIs and
put the Mariners ahead, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 5, Detroit 3--Eric Chavez homered twice to lead the
Athletics to a victory at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada also homered to extend his hitting streak to 21
games--best in the AL this season. Ray Durham homered and Chavez
drove in three runs as the A's won for only the third time in nine
games.</TE>
<TE>   Micah Bowie (1-0) got the final two outs in the fifth inning for
his first AL victory and his first big league win since Sept. 23,
1999, with the Chicago Cubs. Steve Sparks (5-11) was the loser.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, Chicago 0--Eric Milton pitched his fourth career
shutout and Michael Cuddyer hit his first career grand slam as the
Twins won at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Milton (13-7) held Chicago to three hits, striking out 11 and
walking none in Minnesota's first complete game shutout of the
season. Dan Wright (7-9) was the loser.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, Tampa Bay 3--Chris Richard homered for the second
consecutive game after being activated from the disabled list and
Sidney Ponson (5-5) won for the second time in 12 starts to propel
the Orioles at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Kansas City 2--Roy Halladay (13-4) won his eighth
consecutive road decision and Jose Cruz Jr. singled home the go-ahead
run in the seventh inning at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>

<HD>Washburn New Yankee Clipper</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He gives up one run in seven innings for 13th win
in 14 decisions and Angels take lead in wild-card race with 2-1
victory over New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are the Bronx Bombers. The mere sight of those New York Yankee
pinstripes, the mere mention of names such as Jeter and Clemens and
Giambi, the mere thought of playing the perennial champions of the
game strikes fear in every city they go.</LD>
<LD>   Every city, it seems, but Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   In three of the last four years, the Yankees have been world
champions. Last season, they got as far as the seventh game of the
World Series before losing to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Yet over that
four-year span, the Angels have a 22-17 record against the Yankees,
the only team with a winning record against them over that period.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels picked up their 22nd win Thursday night at Edison
Field, beating the Yankees, 2-1, in front of a sellout crowd of
42,897 to break a two-game losing streak. They did it with solid
pitching and spectacular defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Having to play 162 games against the Yankees would be no picnic,"
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but over the last four years, it has been more feast
than famine.</TE>
<TE>   Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn, coming off a loss that ended
his 12-game winning streak, got back in the win column Thursday,
improving to 13-3.</TE>
<TE>   "After two tough [team] losses, it's good to win, particularly
against a team of that caliber," said Washburn, who held the Yankees
to a run and four hits in seven innings. "[Yankee starter Jeff]
Weaver has always been tough on us, so I knew I had to be extra
sharp. I don't think I was as good as I can be, but I was good
enough, and I had some huge plays behind me."</TE>
<TE>   The win gave the Angels a one-game lead over Boston in the
American League wild-card race and kept them two back of Seattle in
the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was perfect through three innings, retiring all nine men
he faced. The perfect game ended in the fourth when Alfonso Soriano,
the first batter, walked on a 3-2 pitch.</TE>
<TE>   That had to bring a smile to the face of Yankee Manager Joe Torre
since it was only the 18th time Soriano, his leadoff hitter, has
walked in 103 games, and one of those was intentional.</TE>
<TE>   "He's aggressive," Torre said. "This guy comes up wanting to be on
second, but he doesn't want to walk and steal second. He wants to
double."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn's no-hitter ended three batters later when Bernie
Williams singled to right, sending Soriano to third. But there he
remained when Washburn struck out Jorge Posada to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Washburn, Weaver had a rocky start, surrendering an Angel
run in the first inning. With one out, Darin Erstad walked, went to
third on Tim Salmon's single to center and scored on Garret
Anderson's sacrifice fly to deep right for his team-leading 80th run
batted in.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' second run came on Brad Fullmer's leadoff homer in the
fourth inning, his 11th home run of the season coming on a 1-2 pitch
off Weaver.</TE>
<TE>   That's all Washburn had to work with, along with his assortment of
pitches and an assortment of impressive fielding plays.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth inning with one out and Soriano aboard, Jason Giambi
hit a fly ball to right that Salmon lost in the lights. He spread his
arms wide, palms up, indicating he had no idea where the ball was.
But just in time, Salmon located it, recovered and sprinted over to
catch it in right-center. Williams followed with a single.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth inning with two out and Jeter aboard, Williams hit a
sharp grounder that appeared headed for right field. It never got
that far thanks to second baseman Adam Kennedy, who dived to his
left, stretched out his body, snared the ball, then pulled himself up
and threw from his knees, first baseman Scott Spiezio finishing the
spectacular play by digging the ball out of the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning with two on and two out, the Yankees having
scored their only run on an RBI single by Ron Coomer, Soriano hit a
hot grounder to third that Troy Glaus fielded, then spun around
before getting a force on Coomer.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia had stuck with Washburn in that seventh-inning situation,
allowing him to continue after the Yankees had put two runners aboard
with one out. Washburn responded by getting Chris Widger on a fly
ball and Soriano on the grounder to Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   But in the eighth, needing three more outs to get to Troy
Percival, Scioscia did so by committee, employing Brendan Donnelly,
Scott Schoeneweis and Ben Weber.</TE>

<HD>Nieves Designated for Assignment</HD>

<LD>At one end of the Angel clubhouse before Thursday night's game, one
player slipped into the jersey with the Angel logo with obvious
relish, pressed a fist firmly into his glove, straightened his cap
and headed to the field with a big smile on his face.</LD>
<LD>   Putting on a team's uniform for the first time can be so sweet.</LD>
<LD>   At the other end of the now-deserted clubhouse, another player sat
in a stall dressed in a short-sleeved shirt, warmup pants and
sandals. The look on his face was one of consternation and
frustration. He didn't smile and he was in no hurry to go anywhere.</LD>
<TE>   Taking off a team's uniform for the last time can be so sour.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Alex Ochoa was in uniform after being acquired by the
Angels in a Wednesday trade.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming from last place to first place, you can't help but be
excited," said Ochoa, the outfielder who was obtained along with
minor league catcher Sal Fasano from the Milwaukee Brewers for
catcher Jorge Fabregas and two players to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Said a somber Jose Nieves, the infielder who was designated for
assignment by the Angels: "I didn't fit on this team. That's reality
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Nieves, 27, who was first signed by the Brewers a decade ago, was
hitting .289 for the Angels in 45 games with two doubles and six runs
batted in. The Angels needed to make room for catcher Bengie Molina,
who was activated from the disabled list after recovering from a
strained hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels can wait 10 days to see if anybody claims Nieves off
waivers before sending him to the minors or releasing him, but
General Manager Bill Stoneman said he expects something to happen
today.</TE>
<TE>   Nieves, who was obtained by the Angels before last season from the
Chicago Cubs for pitcher Mike Fyhrie, hopes that doesn't mean another
trip to the minors.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go back to triple A," Nieves said. "That doesn't
make sense."</TE>

<HD>Offerman Is Angry After Being Released</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Red Sox released Jose Offerman on Thursday to make room
for Cliff Floyd and must pay the first baseman more than $4.1 million
that remains on his contract.</LD>
<LD>   In another move, right-hander Willie Banks was designated for
assignment to triple-A Pawtucket to open a roster spot for newly
acquired right-hander Bob Howry.</LD>
<LD>   Offerman, a former Dodger, reacted angrily when General Manager
Mike Port informed him of the decision. Offerman also yelled a
profanity at reporters who were in the clubhouse and threw equipment.</LD>
<TE>   "Why didn't you tell me when I was in Los Angeles?" he screamed at
Port, who delayed the announcement until the team was in Texas in
case Floyd had been unable to join the Red Sox on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Offerman's off-season home is in Toluca Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Offerman signed a $26-million, four-year deal in November 1998.
The Red Sox are responsible for the remaining $2,131,149 of this
year's $6.5 million salary, and a $2-million buyout of an $8-million
club option for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Offerman, who was an All-Star in 1995 and 1999, was batting 232
with four homers and 27 runs batted in in 72 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my call. For $6.5 million, I felt he could wait another
day," Port said.</TE>

<LD>Former investors of the Montreal Expos are using a famous piece of
law enforcement legislation in their lawsuit against baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig and other officials for allegedly "determining
that Major League Baseball in Montreal should be eliminated."</LD>
<LD>   The Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act has been
used against organized crime, labor unions and motorcycle gangs.
RICO, the act's acronym, also was the name of Edward G. Robinson's
character in the classic gangster film "Little Caesar."</LD>
<LD>   At the end of the movie, when Robinson's character is gunned down
in the street, his last words are, "Mother of mercy, is this the end
of Rico?"</LD>
<TE>   Thom Loverro of the Washington Times asked the act's author,
Robert Blakey, if he came up with the acronym to fit the "Little
Caesar" character.</TE>
<TE>   "I decline to answer that," Blakey said. "But I will say I am a
movie buff."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Loverro: "Mother of mercy, is this the end of Buddy?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are the three NFL quarterbacks who have not
missed a game in the last three seasons?</TE>
<TE>   What, me worry? Arkansas football Coach Houston Nutt set the tone
for Southeastern Conference media day when he cheerfully announced
that star defensive back Ken Hamlin is serving a jail sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "He reports [to jail] every afternoon at 4 p.m.," Nutt said. "If
he is on work release, he can go out during the day, but he has to be
back by 4. He might be out right now with some other inmates
alongside a highway."</TE>
<TE>   Gone Hollywood: Thomas Henderson, former flamboyant linebacker for
the Dallas Cowboys, says he and his famous nickname parted company
after he won $28 million in the Texas lottery two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I won the lottery ... I make an 88-year-old man look
like a workaholic," Henderson told the Miami Herald. "I'm 49 and fat.
So who's going to call me Hollywood?"</TE>
<TE>   Whiff of futility: Ventson Donelson, a former player for the
Saskatchewan Roughriders, is suing the Canadian Football League
because he claims a referee's penalty flag that struck him in the
face two years ago cost him his sense of smell.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't such a bad thing, writes Dwight Perry of the Seattle
Times: "The Roughriders have stunk up the CFL with the league's worst
record since the incident."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1938, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the
St. Louis Cardinals used an experimental yellow ball in the first
game of a doubleheader. The teams went back to a white ball in the
second game.</TE>
<TE>   Also on this day, in 1979, New York Yankee catcher Thurman Munson
died in the crash of his private plane while practicing takeoffs and
landings at an airport in Canton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Brett Favre of Green Bay, Rich Gannon of Oakland
and Peyton Manning of Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue presented Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi with a 49er helmet and a No. 1
Redskin jersey to commemorate Saturday's American Bowl between San
Francisco and Washington at Osaka, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "The helmet will come in useful when I go to work," Koizumi joked.</TE>

<HD>Insider Training</HD>
<DH>Cowboys move camp into Alamodome, where the only thing
that's hot is the music</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Three weeks after Ringling Bros. packed the tents and rolled out of
town, the real circus arrived at the Alamodome.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas Cowboys have moved their training camp to the
air-conditioned stadium and--with an HBO camera crew in tow--have
searched for new ways to pump life into a humdrum rite of summer.</LD>
<LD>   Some changes have worked. The players, coaches and fans love the
reprieve from the 100-degree temperatures and wilting humidity, and
the team is easily on track to draw more than 100,000 spectators this
summer. All that for a team coming off a 5-11 season.</LD>
<TE>   Some changes have flopped. When camp opened Saturday, the Cowboys
blasted rock music through the stadium speakers, ran a continuous
loop of commercials on the Jumbotrons, and hired a zany master of
ceremonies to work the crowd of thousands. He came up with these
zingers:</TE>
<TE>   "Laredo's in the house!"</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, folks, we've got a fan here all the way from Germany!"</TE>
<TE>   And, in a blissful moment of calm, "I can't heeeear you!"</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Rowdy, the overstuffed Cowboy mascot, zoomed around
the field on an all-terrain vehicle, weaving around the knee-high
sideline billboards and the inflatable Pepsi and Miller Lite bottles.
No one seemed to notice when he accidentally plowed into an
unsuspecting photographer. Fans cheered everything from stretching
exercises to punting drills. Landry &amp; Staubach has gone Siegfried &amp;
Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after coaches complained they were having a tough time
doing their jobs, the Cowboys turned down the music and pulled the
plug on the emcee. Training camp started to feel like training camp
again.</TE>
<TE>   Well, almost. Life inside the climate-controlled bubble is so
comfortable that some players have taken to calling it Club Med. The
Cowboys paid $120,000 to have the south parking lot transformed into
a grass practice field, but the sod strips have yet to grow together.
The field is a checkerboard of inch-wide seams filled with sand.
Emmitt Smith, on the verge of breaking the NFL rushing record, took
one look at the surface and refused to practice on it, unwilling to
risk his knees.</TE>
<TE>   Groundskeepers, armed with high-powered hoses and buckets of
fertilizer, are in a mad scramble to get the outside field ready as
soon as possible. Inside, the players are practicing on RealGrass,
which is gushy-soft and looks like AstroTurf in need of a mowing.
They say they love it, and the Cowboys hope to surface Texas Stadium
with it this season. The benefit to practicing inside also could be a
drawback for a team that used to spend summers in the sweltering heat
of Austin or Wichita Falls.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been a team historically that has said, 'Hey, you've got
to have the heat. We're going to play in the heat, so we're going to
train in the heat,' " said Stephen Jones, director of player
personnel and owner Jerry Jones' son. "People are going to watch us
closely to see what kind of success we have and how we respond to
it."</TE>
<TE>   The first test comes tonight, when the Cowboys scrimmage against
the expansion Houston Texans at Robertson Stadium on the University
of Houston campus. The teams are expecting a crowd of 30,000. Almost
that many people were on hand here last Friday to welcome the Cowboys
with a kickoff party.</TE>
<TE>   "It was crazy, like a rock concert," safety Darren Woodson said.
"I was one of the last ones to walk out on stage and there were a sea
of people out there. It felt like a Super Bowl.... I've been here for
a long time. I know fanfare. I've seen the Troy Aikmans and Michael
Irvins of the early '90s who couldn't walk through a hotel without
getting mobbed. It was like a rock concert everywhere we went. But
for guys like La'Roi Glover, Kevin Hardy and Bryant Westbrook to come
in, guys who have never seen that, it just blows their minds."</TE>
<TE>   Glover formerly played for New Orleans, Westbrook played for
Detroit, and Hardy played for Jacksonville, where Coach Tom Coughlin
ran a training camp that made basic training look like a garden
party.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called Camp Coughlin," Hardy said. "He's a hard-nosed,
strictly work, hardly-any-play guy. No sunglasses. Hats off when you
walk into a meeting room. No eating in the meeting rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Out here in stretching, you can take your helmet off and set it
on the side. At Camp Coughlin, you've got to have your helmet on
buckled up in the heat. Practice was full-scale every time you took
the field. There wasn't a lot of joking and having fun on the field.
When you're out there, you've got to make a play. Sometimes guys will
woof a little bit, but there wasn't any of that. He was right there
on you. When you walked on the field in Jacksonville, you immediately
knew who was in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, there's a ton of people on the sidelines. In Jacksonville,
we practiced in a fenced-off area, and everybody is behind the fence,
with the exception of the media. Down there, you might have had maybe
four television cameras. You come out here and they have 25 or 30.
It's a media frenzy, HBO, 'Hard Knocks.' You're on the field trying
to get a play, you try to look and a camera is like right here
[holding his palm an inch away from his face]."</TE>
<TE>   Hardy might sound annoyed, but he's not. How could he be? The
Cowboys are staying in an upscale hotel, not a low-rent college
dormitory, and they have bellhops lugging their bags. The players
spend their days barely breaking a sweat in 72-degree conditions,
then explore San Antonio, stroll the Riverwalk, watch the sunset from
paddleboats. Not too shabby for the underachieving Cowboys, who join
San Diego as the only two teams who have lost at least 10 games in
each of the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Some people have questioned whether this cushy, distracting
approach will sufficiently prepare the team for the rigors of the
season. But it's hard to fault the Cowboys for choosing to keep cool,
especially a year after Minnesota Viking Korey Stringer died of
heatstroke. Stephen Jones thinks his team could be on the cutting
edge.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize how much more work we could get done when the
players weren't just trying to survive," he said. "You get out in
this 95-, 100-, 105-degree heat, and their mind goes from learning
and trying to get better to just, 'How am I going to make it through
these two hours? Am I going to pass out?' "</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell if this becomes a trend or simply another quirky
Cowboy twist. There have been a lot of those. In the late '80s, Tex
Schramm, then team president, sold the TV rights to the afternoon
workouts in Thousand Oaks to a cable distributor. Fearing opponents
might tune in via satellite, Coach Tom Landry shifted drills from the
afternoon to the morning session so he could safely install offensive
and defensive schemes.</TE>
<TE>   No such worries now. After all, what does Cowboy training camp
have to do with football?</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Give It Thumb Down</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Stunned by Gagne ejection, they blow 4-0 lead to
Reds and lose in 13th on Griffey's homer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers were furious Thursday long before Ken Griffey Jr.'s
two-run, walk-off home run capped a 6-4, 13-inning victory for the
Cincinnati Reds that left both teams perplexed about an umpire's
judgment.</LD>
<LD>   Griffey sent a 2-and-2 pitch from Omar Daal into the second deck
in right field with one out and Austin Kearns at first, ending a
4-hour 38-minute game highlighted by the ninth-inning ejections of
Manager Jim Tracy and All-Star closer Eric Gagne after umpire Dan
Iassogna's stunning call.</LD>
<LD>   Iassogna tossed Gagne when he hit Adam Dunn with a fastball on his
right elbow after a two-run homer by Aaron Boone, the previous
batter, had cut the Dodgers' lead to 4-2. The turn of events set off
the shocked Dodgers and stirred renewed interest in what remained of
a crowd of 27,950 at Cinergy Field. Iassogna did not issue a warning,
and there were no incidents that preceded Dunn being hit.</LD>
<TE>   Gagne raced from the mound to confront Iassogna once he realized
he was out of the game, shouting in his face that he would not
intentionally try to hit a batter in that situation, bringing the
potential tying run to the plate. Catcher Chad Kreuter continued the
argument while Tracy raced from the dugout in an attempt to prevent
Gagne from bumping Iassogna and making the situation worse, but Tracy
had difficulty restraining the burly pitcher and needed the help of
players and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just wondering where he was the whole game," said Gagne, who
took out his frustration on equipment in the dugout after his first
ejection. "It's the ninth inning; it's not really a good time to put
the potential tying run at the plate. It's a no-brainer. It's just a
bad call. A home run would tie the game. I'm the closer, I'm not
supposed to do that. It's a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the world knew that was unintentional. I have no
idea what he was thinking. Big game like this, you've got to have
your head in the game. It looks like it was his first game or
something. I know [the commissioner's office] has people who
[evaluate] those umpires, so maybe they'll do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Even Dunn said Gagne didn't intentionally hit him.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely not," he said. "The situation ... he wouldn't want to
hit me. That was one of those where it's the umpire's [call], whether
he feels if it's intentional or not, and he feels it was
intentional."</TE>
<TE>   Iassogna stood his ground.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things Major League Baseball has put an emphasis on is
situations that involve pitchers intentionally throwing at batters,"
said Iassogna, listed as a triple-A umpire with major league
experience in an umpire media guide distributed by the commissioner's
office.</TE>
<TE>   "A particular emphasis comes after a home run, and we had a home
run that cut the lead in half. Then Gagne threw a fastball high, head
high, over the shoulders, shoulder high, right at Dunn, who was the
next batter [on] the next pitch right after a home run. So I
immediately ejected him."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy quickly followed Gagne out of the game after Iassogna
repeatedly insisted Gagne was going after Dunn despite the situation.
The ejections stunned the Dodgers in a game they figured was close to
completion with one of the major leagues' most dominant relievers
still working with a two-run cushion.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds tied the score, 4-4, on Jason La Rue's two-out, two-run
double to left against Giovanni Carrara, who followed Paul Quantrill
and Jesse Orosco to the mound, and that's the way things remained
until Griffey connected against Daal (8-6), the seventh Dodger
pitcher, giving Scott Williamson (3-3), the sixth Cincinnati pitcher,
the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds (56-51) took two of three in the series from the Dodgers
(60-48), who dropped to 4-5 on a season-high, 13-game trip. They now
must reshuffle their rotation beginning a four-game series tonight
against the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium, and also are
working with a tired bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gagne insisted he did not bump Iassogna, TV replays
indicated he appeared to make incidental contact during the heated
exchange. Iassogna said he would not report that he was bumped to the
league office.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers were still concerned Gagne might face disciplinary
action for a call they said was way off base.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to say, really, other than the fact, in my
opinion, that was the grossest error in judgment in quite possibly
the history of the game," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that you have to lose a game like that. We get to be
held accountable for that decision, and to me that is just very
unfair. Anybody who watches that, and looks upon that that has a feel
for the game of baseball, I really think that would be their take on
it. There's nothing else to say."</TE>

<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Manager Jim Tracy shuffled the Dodger rotation for the four-game
series against the Phillies after Thursday's 6-4, 13-inning loss to
the Cincinnati Reds.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Daal, scheduled to start tonight against his former club,
pitched the final 1 1/3 innings Thursday and took the loss, so Andy
Ashby is now scheduled to start the opener. Kazuhisa Ishii will to
start Saturday on three days' rest after throwing only 72 pitches and
working 2 2/3 innings Tuesday in a 12-4 loss to the Reds.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers will turn back to Daal on Sunday, and Hideo Nomo will
take his regular turn Monday in the final game of the season-high,
13-game trip.</LD>
<TE>   "We're really in a tough spot now with our staff, but I think
we'll bounce back from it," catcher Chad Kreuter said. "It's
something you get [upset about], but things like this that happen
tend to draw teams together. This might be one of 'em."</TE>
<TE>   Odalis Perez, pitching on nine days' rest, worked seven scoreless
innings in his first strong start since tossing a one-hitter against
the Colorado Rockies on June 25. The left-hander gave up only two
hits and had five strikeouts with two walks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was waiting for one outing like that to get back on track," he
said. "For me to go to the Dominican [Republic] for four days and see
my family was great. My mind is fresh. Now, I have to do whatever it
takes for me to be out there every five days, and give this team a
chance to win."</TE>

<HD>Eagle Helps Pate Grab Lead in Colorado</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Pate capitalized on a five-point eagle and favorable playing
conditions to forge a first-round lead Thursday in the International
at Castle Rock, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Pate finished with 11 points under the modified Stableford scoring
system used in this event. He was a point ahead of Billy Mayfair and
Rich Beem.</LD>
<LD>   Duffy Waldorf, Australian John Senden, Heath Slocum, Hank Kuehne
and Jeff Quinney were at nine.</LD>
<TE>   Players earned five points for an eagle, two for birdie, zero for
par, minus-one for bogey and minus-three for double bogey or worse.</TE>
<TE>   Golfers with morning tee times--including Waldorf and Senden--had
to contend with swirling winds and hard, fast greens at Castle Pines
Golf Club. Conditions improved in the afternoon, and so did scores.</TE>
<TE>   "I went out for a newspaper this morning and it was cold and
windy," Pate said. "I was glad I wasn't playing until this afternoon.
We got the better of it."</TE>
<TE>   A member of the 1999 Ryder Cup team, Pate slumped to 151st on the
PGA Tour money list in 2001, partly because of a back injury. He
ranks 152nd this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played well the last six weeks, so this round doesn't really
surprise me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Senden, who took a double bogey on the eighth hole and had zero
points through 13, finished with a flourish. He eagled the par-five
14th hole, then tacked on birdies at Nos. 15 and 17.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time International winner Phil Mickelson was at minus-two.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Tom Pernice Jr. had five double bogeys and fell
to minus-nine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   British Open champion Ernie Els withdrew from next week's Buick
Open at Grand Blanc, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Els' withdrawal came one day after Mickelson, the No. 2-ranked
golfer in the world, announced he would play in the $3.3-million PGA
Tour event at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club.</TE>

<LD>Johannesburg, brilliant as a 2-year-old but a bust this year, has
been retired and will begin his career as a stallion next year in
Kentucky.</LD>
<LD>   A winner of four Group or Grade I races in 2001, including a
brilliant performance in his main track debut in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Belmont Park, Johannesburg was winless in three races
this year for owners Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier, and trainer
Aidan O'Brien.</LD>
<LD>   After losing his seasonal bow by a nose in a race overseas, his
first defeat in eight races, the son of Hennessy was brought to the
U.S. again for a crack at the Kentucky Derby, even though his
pedigree suggested he had little chance of handling 1 1/4 miles.</LD>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Johannesburg was nowhere to be found at
Churchill Downs. He checked in eighth, 13 lengths behind upset winner
War Emblem. In what turned out to be his final start on June 22 at
Ascot in England, he was ninth, beaten 10 lengths, in the Golden
Jubilee.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we made the mistake of running Johannesburg in the
Kentucky Derby," O'Brien said. "The combination of training him on
bad ground during our wet spring [in Ireland] and trying to stretch
his stamina too far just bottomed him out."</TE>
<TE>   Johannesburg will stand at Ashford Stud in Versailles, Ky., where
his father is a stallion.</TE>

<LD>A little more than 12 months after taking the $75,000 Wickerr
Handicap with Thady Quill, trainer Bobby Frankel will send out
Shibboleth and Fateful Dream in the one-mile turf race.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly six weeks after winning the Jaipur Handicap at Belmont
Park, Shibboleth finished fifth of seven as the 1-2 favorite in the
Poker.</LD>
<LD>   A 5-year-old son of Danzig owned and bred by Juddmonte Farms,
Shibboleth will break from the rail under jockey Patrick Valenzuela.</LD>
<TE>   Fateful Dream, a 5-year-old Distant View horse owned by Ed Gann,
is a specialist at the Wickerr distance. He has collected four of his
five victories at a mile on the grass, and he should benefit from his
last race. He finished third July 7 at Hollywood Park in his first
start in over a year. Kent Desormeaux, aboard for two of his three
victories in the U.S., has the mount.</TE>
<TE>   The horse to beat is Special Ring. The 5-year-old Nureyev gelding
has won three of his last four for owner William Preston and trainer
Julio Canani.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Del Mar's fourth is a 1 1/16-mile turf route for
$50,000 fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Rock Of Gibraltar. The 3-year-old won his sixth
consecutive Group I race when he took the Sussex Stakes this week in
England.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Global Gait. Purchased for a figure reported to be in
the high six figures last year as a Triple Crown hopeful, the son of
Concern has lost six in a row since joining Bob Baffert's stable and
has not finished higher than fourth in any race. He's entered in
today's eighth at Del Mar, a $40,000 claimer.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Sagle, Demon In The Rough
and Alessandria in the third, Lookn Mighty Fine, River Valley Lass,
Land Tax and Kernitre in the fourth and singling Unfurl The Flag in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/13. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $14/$91. Total money bet: $136.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators for the baseball owners and players worked separately
Thursday, conferring only by telephone, but they are scheduled to
resume talks on a new collective bargaining agreement in New York
today.</LD>
<LD>   Meantime, arbitrator Shyam Das notified the sides that he would
need more time before delivering a decision on the union grievance
challenging the owners' right to unilaterally eliminate teams. Das
was initially expected to rule June 15 but asked for a delay until
Aug. 1. He set no timetable with his new request for more time.</LD>
<LD>   It is unclear how his ruling would affect the current
negotiations, but there has been speculation that his delays are
aimed at giving the sides time to reach a settlement without his
contraction ruling further clouding the process.</LD>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig has said that contraction remains on the
2003 calendar, but baseball would have to eliminate two teams for
scheduling purposes and only the Montreal Expos seem to be a viable
option now that the Minnesota Twins are guaranteed of playing in
Minneapolis through next season.</TE>

<LD>Although she is not yet close to Cigar territory, Ddf De Great Saiga
has quite a win streak going.</LD>
<LD>   The Idaho-bred filly will seek her seventh victory in a row in
tonight's $15,000 Coronado Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Miguel Martinez and trained by Adan Farias, the daughter
of Floyd de Great is the even-money favorite on Ed Burgart's morning
line racing 350 yards against only four opponents.</LD>
<TE>   A winner of eight of 15 in her career, Ddf De Great Saiga hasn't
lost since Dec. 29 and has moved up the class ladder during her
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Her most recent victory came in the Prissy Fein; the former $6,250
claimer has earned over $30,000 this year.</TE>
<TE>   The 125-pound highweight will break from the rail under jockey
Rodrigo Aceves. Gettinouta Dodge, Miami Cartel, Chicks Tell and
Midnight Knight round out the field.</TE>
<TE>   A daughter of Chicks Beduino owned by Martha Wells and trained by
Dan Francisco, Chicks Tell finished a neck behind Ddf de Great Saiga
in the Prissy Fein while two lengths clear of the third-place
finisher.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Synner Or Saint. 2. Yuuba Jr. 3. Jake Blues. 4. A

<LD>From Lloyd Dane, the first Pacific Coast stock car driving champion
in 1954, to Eric Norris, the 2002 points leader, Tim Meyer's first
West Coast Stock Car Reunion last Friday night in Monrovia attracted
a wide range of fender-banging enthusiasts, including NASCAR
President Bill France Jr. and his wife, Betty Jane, from Daytona
Beach, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Nostalgia was the main course as generations of stock car drivers,
car owners, crewmen and promoters tried to outdo one another with
tales of derring-do from one era to another. Most of the real
old-timers were amazed at how far NASCAR and its West Coast
stepchild, the Winston West, have come in 50 years, and the
youngsters were amazed at hearing how primitive racing was conducted
50 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Dane told of driving his Hudson Hornet from his home in Buena Park
to the racetrack, taping over the headlights, racing the car and
driving it home after the event.</LD>
<TE>   The watershed event of West Coast racing was Jan. 10, 1971, at
Riverside International Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   That was the day that Ray Elder, a farm boy from Caruthers,
Calif., driving a family-owned, family-prepared Dodge to victory over
the NASCAR hotshots from the South, beat the likes of Richard Petty,
Bobby Allison, Benny Parsons, Bobby Isaac and others. It was so
shocking to the hierarchy in Daytona Beach that NASCAR at first
refused to list Elder among its race winners.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a watershed day for NASCAR as the Motor Trend 500 was
the first event of what turned into a $1-billion windfall for stock
car racing--the sponsorship money from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., in
the name of the Winston Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Elder received $19,165 for the win. Bill Elliott, last week's
Winston Cup winner at Pocono, Pa., won $193,401 and will also
participate in the $14-million end-of-season point fund.</TE>
<TE>   "People are always asking me if I didn't wish I was in it now,
instead of 30 years ago," said Elder, still a farmer in Caruthers,
"but I tell them I couldn't afford to be in it now. Back then, we
bought a Dodge from Jack McCoy, fixed it up in the garage at the
farm, towed it about 200 miles to Riverside behind a two-seater
truck, unloaded it and raced.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were trying to race today, we couldn't afford to buy a car
and [brother and crew chief] Richard and the volunteer crew couldn't
keep up with the big bucks they spend today. I can't believe all
those 18-wheelers that carry the cars to the track while the drivers
fly around in their jets. Richard and I used to take turns driving
the pickup to the races."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Elder, balder and thinner than in the days he weighed 250
pounds in racing trim, still runs the family farm outside Caruthers,
a tiny spot in the San Joaquin Valley. But things are different now.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Elder, the 300-pounder known as Big Red, died five years
ago. Fred Elder, the father who helped his boys with their racing
dreams, died 15 years ago. And the 240 acres of alfalfa and cotton
they worked in the '70s is now 140 acres of Thompson seedless grapes,
to be dried into raisins.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought about trying Winston Cup, but it would have meant
moving down south and if I got hurt or something and things didn't
work out, we could have lost everything, back there and here, too, so
we decided to stick with the farm. Besides, I never seemed to be
accepted by NASCAR."</TE>
<TE>   Elder was not only referring to the way he was slighted after
winning at Riverside. It went back to an earlier race, April 30,
1966, at Ascot Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been a sportsman car driver until one night at Stockton,
they had a doubleheader, a sportsman and a late model [later Winston
Cup] race. I finished fifth in the late model and when I got more
money than I got for winning the sportsman, I decided to switch.</TE>
<TE>   "The next race was at Ascot and we took that old '64 Dodge down
there and won the race. But we were running some retread tires we'd
bought from McCoy and after 200 laps at Ascot they had swollen and
NASCAR officials said they were illegal in the post-race inspection.
They said they wouldn't pay us.</TE>
<TE>   "We argued nearly all night and didn't get paid until McCoy--he
was one of the regulars that they knew--argued our case and told them
we got the tires from him. Otherwise, we would have been out of luck
because they didn't take kindly to having some unknown kid come in
and take their money.</TE>
<TE>   "As it was, we didn't get our money until 4 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   The Racin' Farmers went on to win 47 races, second to McCoy's 54
in Winston West competition, and championships in 1969, 1970, 1971,
1972, 1974 and 1975.</TE>
<TE>   And just to prove that his 1971 win at Riverside was no fluke,
Elder beat the big boys again in 1972 in the Golden State 400, a
summer race at Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   The CART Case</TE>
<TE>   Chris Pook may get away with starting only 18 cars in his CART
races on road courses, but how is it going to look when they are
stretched around the two-mile California Speedway?</TE>
<TE>   Especially after a couple of them failed to last the first lap,
which seems to be becoming a CART trademark.</TE>
<TE>   Five of their races have essentially been 16-car races.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Vasser and Kenny Brack took each other out on the first lap
Sunday in Vancouver. The race before that, in Cleveland, it was
Townsend Bell and Mario Dominguez not making it through a single lap.
In Chicago, it was Vasser and Brack again. At Laguna Seca, Adrian
Fernandez and Dario Franchitti went home early. And in the season
opener in Japan, it was Bell and Vasser (do we see a trend here?) not
finishing a lap.</TE>
<TE>   Only seven cars were running after 178 miles at the end of
Sunday's Vancouver race. How would that look at Fontana--which is 500
miles?</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Bernstein will continue his relentless pursuit of Larry
Dixon when the National Hot Rod Assn. travels to Infineon Raceway at
Sonoma this weekend. Dixon, after winning seven of the first 12
events, has hit on hard times, failing to qualify once and losing in
the first round the following week, so his lead is now down to an
uncomfortable 97 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Speedboat Club will present Long Beach
Sprint Nationals, a series of championship circle boat races,
Saturday in Long Beach Marine Stadium. Featured will be 140 mph
K-Racing Runabouts (blown alcohol inboard flatbottoms), Formula Light
tunnel boats, the quickest turning high-speed boats in racing, and
water ski racers. Racing starts at 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robby Gordon will drive in Sunday's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis,
but with an aluminum insert in his left shoe to stabilize his foot.
Gordon broke his left heel and sprained both ankles in a motocross
bike accident near Pocono, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Long of Agoura celebrated his 21st birthday Sunday with a
wire-to-wire win in the eighth race of the Formula Renault UK
championship series at Snetterton. Later in the day, in the ninth
round, he finished second in his Fortec Motorsport-prepared machine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Racing Assn. sprint and senior sprint cars will hold their
weekly competition Saturday night--but not at their home track in
Ventura. With the one-fifth-mile track closed because of the Ventura
County Fair, promoter Jim Naylor is taking his show to Perris Auto
Speedway for the first of two appearances at the half-mile oval. They
will return Aug. 17. It should be a novel experience, with drivers
used to a fifth-of-a-mile track at Ventura turned loose on a
half-mile oval at Perris.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cory Kruseman of Ventura won the Jan Oppermann Classic last
Saturday night at Terre Haute to clinch the Indiana Sprint Week
championship. He edged J.J. Yeley in the eight-race series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Jack Hewitt, who underwent five hours of neck surgery
following an accident during Sprint Week, continues to recuperate at
Indianapolis Methodist Hospital. He is listed as "stable."</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Sabonis Return Would Intrigue the Lakers</HD>

<LD>Arvydas Sabonis' return to the NBA after a year away appears to be a
possibility and therefore he is at least a curiosity for the Lakers,
who would like a backup to Shaquille O'Neal but don't have much to
spend for it.</LD>
<LD>   Sabonis, the hulking 7-foot-3, 37-year-old Lithuanian, was last
seen fleeing the Portland Trail Blazers, one of whom, Rasheed
Wallace, had thrown a towel in his face during a regular-season game
at Staples Center against the Lakers. He was said to have been in Los
Angeles this week, though the Lakers neither met with Sabonis nor
planned to.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Mitch Kupchak and Coach Phil Jackson are out of
town.</LD>
<TE>   Laker management has had discussions with Sabonis' agent,
Chicago-based Herb Rudoy, to investigate the chance Sabonis would
restart his career as a reserve in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sources in Portland said Sabonis would meet as early as Tuesday
with Trail Blazer President/General Manager Bob Whitsitt and Coach
Maurice Cheeks, though Whitsitt would not confirm that, and that the
Trail Blazers already had offers of $6 million for one year or $10
million for two years on the table.</TE>
<TE>   Though those close to Sabonis regularly claim he has not played
since retiring after the 2000-01 season--a career choice for which
O'Neal gleefully takes credit--Sabonis apparently has worked out with
a professional team in Malaga, Spain, where he resides, and with a
team he partly owns in Lithuania. In March, Sabonis told a Lithuanian
reporter that he was only 15 pounds over his playing weight and that
he was swimming and shooting regularly.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers, overmatched with Dale Davis at center against
O'Neal, retain their rights to Sabonis, and therefore can offer far
more than the Lakers can, despite being well over the salary cap. The
Lakers have only their $1.4-million exception, and apparently would
have to sell Sabonis on a chance for a championship.</TE>

<TE>   First-round pick Chris Wilcox signed a three-year contract with
the Clippers worth about $5.16 million under the rookie wage scale.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-10, 221-pound forward was the eighth selection in the draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix Sun forward Shawn Marion agreed to a $79-million, six-year
contract, according to a team official who did not want to be
identified.... The New Jersey Nets brought Chris Childs back into the
fold, signing him to a two-year, $3.5-million contract as a backup
for point guard Jason Kidd.... The Denver Nuggets acquired forward
Don Reid and a future first-round selection from the Orlando Magic
for a second-round draft pick in 2004.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras' latest bid to end a two-year drought without a
tournament title ended Thursday in a 7-6 (3), 3-6, 7-6 (5)
third-round loss to Tommy Haas at the Toronto Masters Series.</LD>
<LD>   No. 3-seeded Haas of Germany fired 24 aces in ousting Sampras, the
No. 13-seeded and a former world No. 1 who hasn't won in 30
tournaments since becoming Wimbledon champion in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a frustrating year, but I still feel like I've got the
game," Sampras said. "Hopefully, one week it's going to click.</LD>
<TE>   "It's something I've never had to do before. I could walk away
tomorrow and feel like I've done everything I've wanted, but I still
feel like there's one last moment for me, maybe a couple of moments."</TE>
<TE>   Haas also believes Sampras still has good tennis left in him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably not at his best, but I think he played really good
tennis and I think he's on his way back to be very dangerous," Haas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, David Nalbandian of Argentina upset No. 4-seeded Tim
Henman of Britain, 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, No. 2-seeded Marat Safin of Russia edged Marcelo
Rios of Chile, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (3); Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic
ousted unseeded American Taylor Dent, 7-5, 6-3; Fabrice Santoro of
France defeated Todd Martin, 6-2, 6-4; and Guillermo Canas of
Argentina topped No. 5-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 6-2, 6-2, and No.

<KH>Sam Farmer ON THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Kelly Leading Drive Against Krabbes Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five-year-old Hunter Kelly has had 15 bouts with pneumonia and a
blood transfusion. He needs a ventilator to breathe, a machine to
eat. His parents have to suction his throat 100 times a day. Lately,
he has been having seizures. He has outlasted his original life
expectancy by more than four years.</LD>
<LD>   And Saturday, he will watch his father be inducted into the Pro
Football Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   "Ever since I was selected, I've prayed every single day and night
that Hunter could be there to see it," said Jim Kelly, who passed for
35,467 yards and led the Buffalo Bills to four consecutive Super
Bowls. "Now it's so close and I'm still praying."</LD>
<TE>   Hunter was born with Krabbes disease, a fatal inherited disorder
of the central and peripheral nervous system. Infants stricken with
the rare, degenerative syndrome eventually become blind, deaf and
paralyzed. Hunter can't speak; he communicates by blinking.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Kelly was at the Super Bowl in New Orleans when he learned he
was headed for Canton. His first call was to his wife, Jill, who then
told their two daughters and held up the phone to Hunter's ear.
Hunter was blinking like crazy.</TE>
<TE>   "We know in our hearts that he knows what's going on," said Kelly,
who shares a birthday with Hunter, born on Valentine's Day in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is a control freak, something he freely acknowledges. Not
only did he run the K-Gun offense, he called every play. No other
modern-day NFL quarterback had that type of leeway. He even designed
his own wedding cake and tried to direct his groomsmen until the
minister stepped in, telling him, "I'm the quarterback here, Jim."</TE>
<TE>   So it is especially frustrating for Kelly that he has very little
control over his son's condition. He can provide Hunter little more
than love and prayer. But he can help in other ways. Kelly and his
wife have formed Hunter's Hope, a foundation that has raised more
than $3 million to combat the effects of Krabbes disease and fund
research to find a cure.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many people touched by life-threatening circumstances,
Kelly's sense of priorities has changed dramatically. Former Buffalo
center Kent Hull, who handled more than 12,000 snaps to Kelly, saw
that right away.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim always wanted a son, and when Hunter was first diagnosed with
cerebral palsy, that just crushed Jim," Hull said. "But cerebral
palsy isn't terminal. Then, when they figured out it was
Krabbes--which is terminal--I saw Jim shift gears. Jim's a fighter,
and so, obviously, is Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim immediately took over and said, 'I can't do anything to help
my son. But I'm going to make damn sure that I do something to help
make sure another parent doesn't have to go through this.' "</TE>
<TE>   The onetime playboy, Buffalo's former most eligible bachelor, is
now a dedicated father and husband who has transformed his basement
from a bar into a playroom. Where there used to be bimbos, there are
now Barbies. The basement is also home to a mini-roller coaster and a
trampoline. It all tickles Darryl Talley, one of Kelly's former
teammates who remembers the crazy days.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the Raiders of the '70s look like angels," Talley said.</TE>
<TE>   On the field, the Bills were wickedly effective. They were led by
the square-jawed Kelly, who had grown up in East Brady, Pa., an area
that produced Hall of Fame quarterbacks Joe Montana, Johnny Unitas,
Joe Namath and George Blanda.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was a first-round pick of the Bills in 1983--a
quarterback class that included Dan Marino and John Elway--Kelly
played his first two seasons for the Houston Gamblers of the United
States Football League. He then spent 11 seasons with the Bills, from
1986 though 1996, threw 237 touchdown passes and essentially became
the identity of the franchise, which also had stars Thurman Thomas
and Bruce Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills won four AFC championships in a row, from the 1990
through '93 seasons, but never made the next step to win the Super
Bowl. They joined the Minnesota Vikings as the only franchises to go
0 for 4 in Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I worry about that? Aw, hell no," Kelly said. "We accomplished
a lot. If I watched one of those games again, yeah, it would hurt.
But I don't even think about it."</TE>
<TE>   Would he like to play those games again? Of course. But those
aren't the most treasured years of his life. These are.</TE>

<HD>Lewis Lands Record $19-Million Bonus</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Lewis agreed to a five-year contract extension Thursday that
includes a record $19-million signing bonus and keeps the All-Pro
linebacker with the Baltimore Ravens through 2008.</LD>
<LD>   The bonus surpasses the $18 million given to Minnesota Viking
receiver Randy Moss.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis' new seven-year contract is worth $50 million. Lewis had two
years left on a deal that was to pay him $4.75 million each year.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis, 27, led the NFL in tackles last year and was selected to
the Pro Bowl for a fifth consecutive time. He was the Super Bowl most
valuable player in the Ravens' 2001 NFL title season, and is the key
element in the team's effort to regroup from a sweeping salary-cap
purge.</TE>
<TE>   Said Raven Coach Brian Billick: "When Ray goes, I'll go. If that's
the way it works out, it will be fine with me."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has bounced back after his troubles in 2001, when he was
charged in the stabbing deaths of two men after a Super Bowl party.
He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of obstruction of justice, was
put on probation for one year and fined $250,000 by the NFL for
"detrimental conduct."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doug Flutie, battling second-year pro Drew Brees for the San Diego

<TE>   Coach Marty Schottenheimer said Flutie, who turns 40 in October,
will start the exhibition opener because he was the starter last
year. Brees is then expected to start against Seattle at home on Aug.

<HD>Guerrero Does a Number on Schilling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vladimir Guerrero was locked in on a rare Curt Schilling mistake.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero hit his second game-ending homer against Arizona in this
series, connecting with one out in the ninth inning off Schilling to
give the Expos a 2-1 victory over the Diamondbacks on Thursday night
at Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   "He always challenges me and throws me balls around the strike
zone," Guerrero said through an interpreter. "The first three
at-bats, I missed that same pitch. I went in looking for it, got it,
and made contact for us to win it."</LD>
<TE>   Guerrero--hitless in his first three at-bats--hit Schilling's
first pitch over the left-field wall for his 28th homer of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw four pitches in three at-bats to him before that at-bat,"
Schilling said. "They were all the same and I just didn't execute the
pitch. I left it up, hung it, and he hammered it."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero hit a game-winning homer in the 10th inning off reliever
Byung-Hyun Kim to win the series opener Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (18-4) had his six-game winning streak stopped as he
lost to an NL opponent for only the second time this season, and
first since an 8-4 loss to St. Louis on April 17.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling gave up seven hits and two runs in 8 1/3 innings as he
pitched his fourth complete game of the season. He struck out seven
to reclaim the major league lead with 219, four more than teammate
Randy Johnson, who struck out 15 in Wednesday's 5-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about pitching well, it's about winning or losing and I
didn't pitch well enough to win tonight," Schilling said.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal's Tomo Ohka gave up one run and six hits in a season-high
eight innings, and Joey Eischen (3-1) allowed one hit in the ninth
for the win.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, San Francisco 1--Randy Wolf (7-7) pitched seven
strong innings and the Phillies scored two runs on a pair of
fielder's choices in the seventh inning to win at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds was out of the Giants' lineup, but he pinch-hit in the
ninth inning. Bonds grounded out after Reggie Sanders led off the
ninth with a single as Jose Mesa got his 30th save in 37
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Ortiz (7-8) pitched a six-hitter in the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Milwaukee 0--Greg Maddux pitched six innings for his
268th career win, tying Hall of Famer Jim Palmer for 30th on the
all-time list, as the Braves completed a three-game sweep at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (11-3) gave up five hits and lowered his NL-leading
earned-run average to 2.45.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's Chipper Jones, who went three for three with a walk, and
Gary Sheffield, with a pair of singles, each had RBIs against Glendon
Rusch (5-11) in a three-run fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Flordia 4, St. Louis 0--A.J. Burnett pitched a four-hitter for his
major league-leading fourth shutout as the Marlins won at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett (11-7) struck out seven, walked three and tied his career
high for wins in a season, set last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals' lone highlight was a triple play in the sixth
inning. It was their first triple play in more than nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Finley (2-1) lost for the first time with the Cardinals,
giving up six hits and two earned runs in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 3, New York 1--Brad Ausmus drove in two runs and Craig
Biggio homered at New York as the Astros won a matchup of wild-card
contenders and improved to 55-52, the same record as the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets lost a series for the first time since the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Oswalt went 6 2/3 innings for the victory and is 5-1 in his
last nine starts.</TE>
<TE>   After the Astros won the series opener, 16-3, and the Mets bounced
back to win, 10-0, Oswalt (12-6) and Pedro Astacio (10-4) put the
emphasis back on pitching.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt had no trouble with the humid, 89-degree conditions or the
Met hitters. Featuring a 96-mph fastball, he took a three-hit shutout
into the seventh inning, and left with two out after pinch-hitter
Tony Tarasco's RBI grounder.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, Pittsburgh 0--Jason Jennings held the Pirates hitless
for 6 2/3 innings and the Rockies salvaged the final game of the
three-game series at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates, outhit 13-2, were shut out for the fourth time in
seven games and the 11th time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, San Diego 7--Alex Gonzalez hit a two-run, two-out
double off Trevor Hoffman in the ninth inning, rallying the Cubs at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman (1-3) was one out from tying Rollie Fingers for sixth on
the career saves list at 341 but instead blew a save for only the
second time in 27 chances this season.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gordon (1-1) got his first victory since May 6, 2001, against

<LD>The Sydney Olympics are in the rearview mirror for the U.S. men's and
women's gymnastics teams, they say, never to be revisited.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. gymnasts won no individual or team medals at the Games, a
considerable disappointment. The women's struggles, coupled with
coaches' jockeying for influence, fractured the team's morale. "We
left Sydney as quickly as possible," said Bob Colarossi, president of
USA Gymnastics.</LD>
<LD>   The first signs of rebirth were evident at last year's World
Championships, where the men's team won a silver medal and the women
won bronze, the first time both teams won medals in the same
competition. This year's U.S. championships, which begin Wednesday in
Cleveland, should provide a gauge of their depth and proficiency as
they build toward the world championships in Hungary in November,
next year's world championships in Anaheim and the 2004 Athens
Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   "The international community is very aware of who our athletes
are," Colarossi said. "Based on what I've seen, in the 2003 world
championships and 2004 Olympic Games people are going to know who
they are."</TE>
<TE>   Defending U.S. men's champion Sean Townsend will continue to
refine new and more difficult routines designed to bring higher
technical marks. He believes it's reasonable for the U.S. men to aim
for the team title next year in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "If everybody is healthy and we get all our guys, the way it's
looking now, that's very possible," said Townsend, who won individual
gold on the parallel bars at last year's world meet. "There are a lot
of good countries, but with home-field advantage we could definitely
come away with a gold medal."</TE>
<TE>   Townsend and Blaine Wilson--recently back from a shoulder
injury--figure to vie for the men's title, but the women's field is
less predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Tasha Schwikert finished second to Annia Hatch
and just ahead of three-time U.S. junior champion Kristal Uzelac at
the American Classic last month. Hatch was born in Cuba and has
become a U.S. citizen, but international gymnastics federation rules
say she must have both countries' permission to compete for the U.S.
in the year after her citizenship change. Cuba has not agreed, but
Colarossi plans to petition international authorities next year to
allow Hatch to compete for the U.S. internationally.</TE>
<TE>   Also among contenders in Cleveland is Tabitha Yim of Irvine, who
won the floor exercise title last year and was second in the
all-around.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot more depth this year," Schwikert said. "I think
it's going to be awesome these next two years. I've experienced so
much since I competed at worlds and the Olympics, and it's only going
to help."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the week's events, Kerri Strug, Trent Dimas, Jair Lynch
and Betty Okino will be inducted into the U.S. Gymnastics Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hold the Thorpedos</TE>
<TE>   Ian Thorpe's quest for seven swimming gold medals at the
Commonwealth Games is admirable, but it's not as impressive as Mark
Spitz's seven-gold medal haul at the 1972 Munich Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The Commonwealth Games are open only to athletes from Great
Britain and former colonies and dependencies, leaving Europeans to
compete in their own championships this week. In addition, many
athletes prefer to focus on this month's Pan Pacific championships in
Yokohama, Japan, which they deem more important.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Thorpe's performances in Manchester, England, are still
noteworthy. The 19-year-old Aussie, who last year became the first
swimmer to win six events at a world championship meet, broke his own
world record in winning the 400-meter freestyle. He added gold in the
400-meter freestyle relay, 200 free and 800-meter freestyle relay and
will swim the 100-meter freestyle, 100-meter backstroke and 400-meter
medley relays this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so far ahead of everybody else, it's amazing," USC swim
coach Mark Schubert said. "I don't think he's really scratched his
potential yet.... He's young, he's a big guy and he's got tremendous
flexibility, tremendous technique and works very hard. He has all the
tools mentally too. He's very tough."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best measure of his status is competitors' regard for
him. "He's like a rock star with them," Schubert said. "Other
swimmers are always asking for his autograph. But he's very down to
earth and a true champion. He gives back to his sport. He always
talks to kids, and they adore him."</TE>
<TE>   Although Schubert agrees Thorpe's exploits at the Commonwealth
Games aren't on the same level as Spitz's Munich success, he thinks
Thorpe has a chance to someday match Spitz's Olympian achievements.</TE>
<TE>   "Ian's just a freestyler, while Mark was an outstanding freestyler
and in the butterfly, which gave him an advantage," Schubert said.
"And the Olympics today are spread out over eight days, with heats
and semifinals and finals. I didn't think anybody could ever
challenge the seven gold medals, but this guy could be the one. He
has no reason to stop, and he's still improving."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Figure skater Naomi Nari Nam of Irvine continues to battle
injuries that have derailed her career since her second-place finish
at the 1999 U.S. championships. Her coach, John Nicks, said Nam had
to halt a planned two-week training session in Cleveland with Carol
Heiss Jenkins to undergo tests on recurring hip problems, and her
future remains unclear. Nam, 17, has missed the last two competitive
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The men's and women's Salt Lake City figure skating gold
medalists, Alexei Yagudin and Sarah Hughes, lead the list of entrants
at Skate America, the first Grand Prix event of the figure skating
season. Russian pair skaters Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze,
co-gold medalists with Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, will
also compete in the event at Spokane, Wash., Oct. 27-30. The
Canadians gave up their Olympic eligibility and won't compete in
Grand Prix events. Pair skaters Rena Inoue and John Baldwin Jr. of
Santa Monica, who train in Aliso Viejo and Paramount, will also
compete at Skate America.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance native Michelle Kwan, the six-time U.S. champion and
four-time world champion, was not among the U.S. Grand Prix entrants
and her agent, Shep Goldberg, reiterated she intends to decide her
plans by the end of the summer. Kwan, who won a bronze medal at Salt
Lake City, skipped the Grand Prix series after the 1998 Nagano
Olympics, where she won silver.</TE>
<TE>   The women's elite race at this year's New York City Marathon will
start 35 minutes before the men's elite and open races, a change made
to maximize TV coverage. The race will be held Nov. 3 ....Tuffy
Latour was named coach of the U.S. men's bobsled national team. He
had been coach of the women's team, which won gold at Salt Lake City
when Jill Bakken and Vonetta Flowers triumphed in the debut of
women's Olympic bobsled competition ....Two-time Olympic gold
medalist Hermann Maier, who missed the Salt Lake City Games because
of injuries he suffered in a motorcycle crash, resumed training with
the Austrian ski team last month. He hopes to return to competition
next season.</TE>

<LD>Placed prominently on the wall of King Kamehameha's Kona Beach Hotel,
on the Big Island of Hawaii, is a replica mount of a 1,062.5-pound
Pacific blue marlin.</LD>
<LD>   This weekend, members of the Laguna Niguel Billfish Club will be
paying homage to the marlin, adorning it with leis in hopes it'll
bring them luck.</LD>
<LD>   They'll be in Kailua-Kona to participate in the 43rd Hawaiian
International Billfish Tournament, which begins Monday and runs
through Friday in the prolific waters off the scenic Kona Coast.</LD>
<TE>   And they'll be trying to do something no other team has done: win
"the granddaddy of fishing tournaments" for a third time.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps they should find another lucky charm. The last time
the Orange County club won the tournament was in 1986, when Gil
Kraemer of San Juan Capistrano landed the big blue, the only
"grander" ever caught during the competition.</TE>
<TE>   It was a dramatic effort, perhaps the most dramatic in the storied
history of the event. The Pajaro Valley Gamefish Club of Northern
California had taken a commanding lead by boating a 780-pound marlin
on the first day of the four-day competition (Wednesday is an off
day).</TE>
<TE>   Points are tallied in several ways--for the biggest marlin each
day and overall, for tagging and releasing marlin under 300 pounds,
for catching other species, for using lighter line, etc.--but on the
final day it was agreed that the only way Pajaro Valley could be
beaten was with a 1,000-pound fish.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it would require a miraculous finish by one of the
other teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We had basically taken the largest lead in 20 years into the
final day," recalled Rocky Franich of Watsonville, Calif.
"Embarrassingly, people were congratulating us for winning in the
morning of the last day, before we even went out."</TE>
<TE>   That day, aboard the Ihu Nui far off the Kona Coast, there was a
strike off the stern and nearly 90 minutes later, Kraemer had the
hulking billfish at leader, after which Capt. Bill Rice and crew had
their hands full with a behemoth that kept getting bigger and bigger,
in their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, one of our members brought along some libations and
by the time we got to the pier the fish grew and grew," said Bob
McIntosh, club president. "News travels fast over there on what they
call the Coconut Wireless. We had radioed in that we had a big fish
and by the time we had got to the pier there must have been 200
people there waiting for us."</TE>
<TE>   Kraemer's catch stood as a line-class world record (for 50-pound
monofilament) until 1993, when Balboa Angling Club member Ray Hawkes
caught a 1,166-pound fish during the Pro-Am, held each week before
the main event.</TE>
<TE>   Said Franich: "It was talked about so widely that my sister,
driving in her car that day with her husband to her 15th high school
reunion in Pittsburgh, heard about it on the radio that same day.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew we were leading significantly but heard that a huge
marlin over 1,000 pounds had been caught in Hawaii by a team from
Southern California, beating out a team from [Northern California]."</TE>
<TE>   Civil Wars</TE>
<TE>   Though this year's tournament features teams from Australia,
Japan, Africa, Ireland and the Philippines, along with teams from
throughout the United States, it is being billed as a battle between
the North and South because Pajaro Valley and Laguna Niguel are the
only teams with two victories.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a contest within that contest. Both teams also
feature prominent lure manufacturers. On Pajaro Valley's team is Joe
Yee of Honolulu, maker of Joe Yee lures. On Laguna Niguel's team is
Brooks Morris, founder of the club and maker of Doorknob lures.</TE>
<TE>   Both are large and colorful skirted lures designed to mimic the
baitfish marlin like to eat--and both are proven. Yee's lures are
said to have caught more granders than any other lure, which is
hardly surprising given that Hawaii produces more granders than
anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   A prototype of Morris' marlin lures was used by the Laguna Niguel
team to catch the winning fish during the 1985 tournament. The lures
went into production in 1986 and Kraemer used one to catch his
grander--which beat out Pajaro Valley's 780-pounder, caught by Yee on
one of his lures.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe makes a great lure," said Morris, 74, a retired Air Force
colonel and fighter pilot. "We'll see what happens this year."</TE>
<TE>   That Sinking Feeling</TE>
<TE>   The billfish tournament as recently as the late 1980s hosted more
than 75 teams from more than a dozen nations, but participation has
since dropped considerably and this year only 22 teams will vie for
the prestigious Governors' Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Among reasons: economic troubles around the world and an increase
in tournaments luring participants away with big cash prizes. Also a
factor was the cancellation of the 1999 tournament for
"restructuring." That's the official line, but in-fighting among
organizers is the unofficial and more likely reason for a hiatus that
led some to seek other tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Now organizers are trying to lure the fishermen back, but it
hasn't been easy. Not when they're asking $3,800 for a team of four
and an additional $2,600 per team for charter boat fees. No prize
money is awarded the winners, which is actually appreciated by many
of the well-to-do participants as it keeps the atmosphere fun and
lessens the likelihood of cheating, which is so prevalent in
big-money tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, entry fees are spent on awards, administrative and
marketing costs, but also on lavish Hawaiian-style parties held
during the week.</TE>
<TE>   As the late actor Lee Marvin once commented, "You need a two-week
vacation after this tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Sparkling Prospects</TE>
<TE>   Last year's tournament produced an exceptional 56 blue marlin,
most of which were released. Pajaro Valley won with 1,350 points
earned by catching and releasing five small blues. Every team logged
at least one marlin and a 617-pounder was the biggest.</TE>
<TE>   This year ought to produce just as much action. Already there have
been two granders and nearly 100 "beasts," or marlin topping 500
pounds, caught off Kona.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Bass fishing: Aaron Martens of Castaic liked his chances of
winning last week's Citgo Bassmasters Classic at Lay Lake near
Birmingham, Ala. And he came close, finishing second to Texas pro Jay
Yelas. Yelas, 36, won with a total weight of 45 pounds 13 ounces for
15 fish. The top honor was worth $203,000. Martens, 29, weighed 15
fish at 39-9 and took home $55,000.... The television audience for
the three-day tournament, on ESPN and ESPN2, was 32% larger than last
year's. The three-day average was 296,000 households, compared to
224,000 in 2001. The ESPN telecast of the final weigh-in ceremony
last Saturday was seen in an average of 431,000 homes, up 46% from
last year's audience of 296,000 homes tuned to ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   * Saltwater report: The jumbo squid (the landings report them as
giant squid) that have made such a big splash from Oceanside to Long
Beach during the past several days appear to have moved out and
things have returned to normal. Sand bass, no longer terrorized by
the voracious mollusks, are again biting like mad at Huntington Flats
and areas south.... The local albacore bite is back on. Newport
Landing's Amigo returned Tuesday with 125 fish caught at the
Butterfly Bank east of San Clemente Island. Pierpoint Landing in Long
Beach sent the Aztec on a two-day trip Tuesday night and the vessel
returned with 280 albacore weighing 14-20 pounds. The Toronado
skipper reported "lots of action" Thursday morning but didn't
elaborate.... The season's first dorado--only a few fish taken from
beneath kelp paddies--were caught this week by San Diego overnight
boats. Yellowfin tuna might not be far behind.</TE>
<TE>   * Hunting: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in its annual
report on breeding ducks and spring habitat conditions across the
north-central U.S. and south-central Canada, announced that breeding
duck populations declined 14% from last year, to 31.2 million birds.
Droughtlike conditions are the main reason. As a result, upcoming
hunting seasons figure to be more restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   * Skiing: Mammoth Mountain is in the middle of a summer
improvement project totaling $24 million. Top priority is
construction of the Village Gondola, a 15-passenger vehicle that will
transport visitors from the Village at Mammoth to Canyon Lodge. The
gondola can accommodate 3,000 riders per hour.... Mountain High in
Wrightwood will sell season passes at a reduced rate Aug. 31 through
Oct. 31. The first 5,000 sold will cost $249 and the next 5,000 will
cost $299. After that they'll cost $499, $199 for children 7-12.

<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and Fish Talk Radio have begun
a "Fish for Blood" drive in hopes of raising 1,000 pints by Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone donating a pint will be awarded a free pass for a half-day
trip aboard the Native Sun out of Long Beach Sportfishing at Berth
55. The medical center's blood donor center can be reached at (562)
933-0808.</TE>

<HD>Player Leaves Poly After Allegations of Rape</HD>

<LD>A Long Beach Poly High football player who has been accused of raping
a female student on campus will not return to the school, according
to Poly co-principal Shawn Ashley.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Banks, a senior arrested July 8 on suspicion of having raped
a sophomore earlier in the day during summer school classes, "will
not be returning to Poly regardless of the outcome of any judicial
procedures," Ashley said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Even if Banks is cleared of wrongdoing, Long Beach Unified School
District spokesman Dick Van Der Laan said he would be in violation of
the district's guidance and discipline code because he has reportedly
told authorities that he had consensual sex on school grounds. Banks
would face an expulsion hearing and automatic revocation of his
interdistrict transfer from Artesia High.</LD>
<TE>   Banks reportedly has been charged with two counts of forcible rape
and one count of sodomy by force and is being held in Los Padrinos
Juvenile Detention Center in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   A judge will decide Aug. 22 whether the 16-year-old will stand
trial as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3, 225-pound linebacker was expected to be a defensive
leader this fall for the Jackrabbits, who have won three consecutive
Southern Section Division I football championships.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor trying the case for the Los Angeles County District
Atty.'s office was in court Thursday and could not be reached for
comment.</TE>

<LD>Maurice Greene, the reigning Olympic and world champion in the 100

Watts, an alumnus, as head coach.</LD>
<LD>   Greene, who lives in Granada Hills and set the world record at
9.79 seconds in 1999, approached Watts about helping coach the
sprinters.</LD>
<LD>   "When you have the fastest man in the world who wants to help

<HD>Russian Tennis Players Wary of Mob Talk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>The official Andrei Medvedev Web site has the all-but-retired
Ukrainian tennis player pictured with a number of friends, among them
current Russian tennis stars Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin.</LD>
<LD>   One photo has the trio sitting in a booth in Paris in October
1999, Medvedev's arms around the shoulder of a friend, Alimzhan
Tokhtakhunov. That name may not have resonated outside of Russia
until this week, when the reputed Russian mobster was arrested in
Italy on Wednesday. He was charged with attempting to bribe officials
and fix the outcome of the last two Winter Olympic figure skating
contests, at Salt Lake City in February and at Nagano, Japan, in
1998.</LD>
<LD>   The extent and nature of his reach into the sport of tennis was
unclear, although Italian police said they uncovered his ties to
other sports figures, including 1999 French Open finalist Medvedev,
according to the Associated Press. Safin and Kafelnikov, both playing
at a Masters Series event in Toronto, acknowledged their friendship
with the alleged crime boss.</LD>
<TE>   "He is a good friend of mine, but I'd rather talk tennis right
now," Kafelnikov said. " ... Whatever happened there, I'm sure is
some kind of mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Said Safin: "Yes, I know him. I don't think it would be nice to
talk about it today. It's not our business."</TE>
<TE>   Russian star Anna Kournikova said she knows of Tokhtakhunov but
declined to go beyond that into any specifics.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I want to comment on that," she said Thursday at
the Acura Classic. "I really don't know.... Everybody in Russia knows
all the Russian tennis players."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the photos from the Medvedev Web site were removed by
Thursday. One was still available in the afternoon but was gone later
in the day. Kournikova was asked if she felt cautious about having
her picture taken with certain individuals, considering this
development involving the other Russian players and Medvedev.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I mean, when you put it this way, yeah," she said,
chuckling. "It's a good thought. It probably can be a little
dangerous. You can't really think about it. If somebody wants to do
something, they'll do it anyway I guess. You can have 10-20
bodyguards, if somebody wants to do something, it will happen."</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious reason for her reluctance to discuss the
situation came as Kournikova walked out of the interview room.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I should be talking about this," Kournikova said.
"I'm Russian, I have to go back there."</TE>

<LD>English midfielder Paul Gascoigne will not be joining Major League
Soccer after all.</LD>
<LD>   D.C. United, the MLS club that had been pursuing the 35-year-old
former World Cup star, Thursday announced that contract talks with
Gascoigne and his agent had ended and that the player known worldwide
simply as "Gazza" is no longer a part of its plans.</LD>
<LD>   Gascoigne, a free agent, had trained twice with the team in the
last week.</LD>
<TE>   The decision not to go forward was said to be mutual.</TE>

before the World Cup and did not make the trip to Korea/Japan '02,

opening game of its four-game tour of England.</TE>
<TE>   Olimpia Wins South American Title</TE>
<TE>   Two teams that are celebrating their centenary--Real Madrid of
Spain and Olimpia of Paraguay--will play each other in the
Intercontinental Cup Final on Dec. 3 in Yokohama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Olimpia advanced to the annual match between the champions of
Europe and South America by coming from behind Wednesday night to
defeat Sao Caetano of Brazil, 4-2, on penalty kicks, and thereby
claim the Copa Libertadores for the third time.</TE>
<TE>   Juninho Denied Work Permit</TE>
<TE>   Winning the World Cup apparently is not enough to get Brazil
midfielder Juninho a work permit to play in England.</TE>
<TE>   The British government denied him the required permit after he had
been acquired by Middlesbrough from Atletico Madrid for $9.33
million.</TE>
<TE>   The government requires foreign players to have played in 75% of
their country's matches over the previous two years to be eligible
for a work permit.</TE>
<TE>   Middlesbrough is appealing the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Under the regulations, only two of Brazil's world champions would
be eligible to play in England: Roberto Carlos and Rivaldo.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Unable to Find Shelter From the Storm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were scores to settle against Seattle, old and new, but the
Sparks ended up on the wrong side of the only one that counts.</LD>
<LD>   After an 81-76 loss to the Storm Thursday night at Staples Center,
they have lost two games in a row for the first time all season--and
their lead over Houston in the Western Conference race has withered
to a half-game.</LD>
<LD>   Coupled with the unlikely loss to Miami Tuesday in the game that
will be remembered more for Lisa Leslie's dunk, the Sparks (20-6)
have lost consecutive games at home for the first time since the 1998
season.</LD>
<TE>   "To lose two in a row, we haven't done that for some time," said
Leslie, who scored a season-high 30 points in a loss marred by
turnovers as well as two technicals and a flagrant foul against the
Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   It was enough to turn the WNBA-mandated 10-minute cooling-off
period into a 25-minute locker-room session after the game.</TE>
<TE>   The team was addressed not only by Coach Michael Cooper and
General Manager Penny Toler, but Spark President Johnny Buss as well.</TE>
<TE>   And no, that doesn't happen often.</TE>
<TE>   "Every blue moon," forward DeLisha Milton said. "The only time we
ever want to see Johnny Buss is when we're popping champagne and he
comes in to congratulate us."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks talk about being like the Lakers, poised to turn their
game on when it matters for another championship drive. But with six
games left in the regular season, they are battling turnovers and
what seems to be a confidence crisis.</TE>
<TE>   They committed 18 turnovers against Seattle, contributing to 25
points by a surging young team led by Australia's Lauren Jackson and
rookie Sue Bird from Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that, the Sparks had the ball and a chance to tie with
18 seconds left, trailing by three after a rare miss from the
free-throw line by Bird.</TE>
<TE>   With less than 10 seconds left, Tamecka Dixon put up an
off-balance three-point attempt--Cooper wanted a foul called on
Bird--and hit nothing but air.</TE>
<TE>   "The refs made the call the way they saw it," Dixon said.
"Obviously, I felt I was hampered."</TE>
<TE>   The play the Sparks looked back to came a little more than a
minute earlier, when 6-foot-4 Kamila Vodichkova took an outside shot
and rebounded her own miss, allowing Seattle to run more time off the
clock.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks got as close as two with 27 seconds left on Nikki
Teasley's three.</TE>
<TE>   But Bird made five of six free throws in the final minute, Dixon
missed, and Jackson made two with 5.8 seconds left to seal it.</TE>
<TE>   For Seattle (15-13) it was a big victory--its second in a row over
the Sparks and one that moved it within a half-game of the final
Western Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   It was a physical game, and perhaps there were a few memories of
the last time the teams met, when the Sparks' Latasha Byears and
Seattle's Michelle Marciniak were ejected after an altercation.</TE>
<TE>   But the calls against the Sparks might have been more the result
of the officials trying to keep an early handle on the game than
anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, who also had 16 rebounds, got a technical for a minor
tangle after a basket, Milton received one for leaning and pushing on
Jackson in the free-throw lane, and Byears--most deservingly--was
given a flagrant offensive foul for a shove that sent Kate Starbird
to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't let them intimidate us with the early flagrant fouls
and the cheap shots," Seattle Coach Lin Dunn said. "We didn't
retaliate. I think we got six points off their flagrant fouls and
technicals."</TE>

<HD>It's One Big Beach Party Now</HD>
<DH>Surfing: U.S. Open is the main event, but there are plenty
of other things to see and do in Huntington Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>The long, peeling left-hand turns that spilled into the Huntington
Beach pier looked identical to the waves David Nuuhiwa surfed nearly
40 year ago. The water churned to foam as it cut through the
barnacle-encrusted pilings, crawled to a stop at the waterline, then
slowly dissipated into the sea.</LD>
<LD>   For Nuuhiwa, the scene brought back memories of 1968, the year he
won the first of two U.S. surfing titles. But a closer look at this
week's Philips U.S. Open of Surfing shows little remains from past
contests at this historic tour stop.</LD>
<LD>   Nuuhiwa, considered by many to be among Southern California's
best-ever surfers, stood atop his usual perch one afternoon this week
and looked out over the dozens of competitors and thousands of surf
fans who have traveled to his home break.</LD>
<TE>   When he first competed at Huntington Beach in the 1960s and '70s,
the only structure other than the city's famed pier was a row of
scaffolding that elevated the judges. Today, the surf contest has
become part of a beached metropolis of extreme sporting venues,
concert stages and rows of sponsor booths occupying a quarter-mile of
sand.</TE>
<TE>   The scene is much busier than at the first West Coast Surfing
Championships held here in 1959, and barely resembles the initial
stadium setting that was erected 20 years ago. The event has grown so
large in the last two years--a crowd approaching 50,000 is expected
for the men's short board final Sunday afternoon; the women's final
is on Saturday afternoon--it makes the city's first beach festival in
1997 look like a garage sale.</TE>
<TE>   But is it a benefit to the Huntington Beach tour stop, which was
viable long before the mobile tattoo parlors and hair care booths
moved in? Or does it water down an event that has long been among the
most popular in the world? Everyone involved seems to feel
comfortable sharing the space.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," said Nuuhiwa, 54, the owner of a Huntington Beach
surfboard company. "The kids are here to enjoy themselves and there's
a lot to do."</TE>
<TE>   While some hard-core surf fans and professionals won't take their
eyes off the waves this weekend, casual fans are anticipating some of
the alternative entertainment. Former world champion Sunny Garcia
isn't scheduled to compete until Saturday, but he has been wandering
the venue since Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's cool," Garcia, who lives in Hawaii, said of the
activity. "If there's a lull in the surf you can go in the back and
check out a concert or some skaters or whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Shea Lopez, ranked third in the World Championship Tour standings,
spends most of his time surfing in desolate places such as Teahupoo
in Tahiti and Jeffreys Bay in South Africa. As he sat in a chair at
the intersection of Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway, signing
autographs for dozens of fans, Lopez said he never feels more like a
professional than when he comes to Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a surf contest, this is an event," Lopez said. "It's a
good chance for us to get out of our bubble a little bit and see what
else is out there."</TE>
<TE>   Travis Mellem, a surfer who will be a senior at San Clemente High
this fall, likes the way the event draws enthusiasts from other
backgrounds. Although he doesn't skateboard or ride BMX, he's more
than happy to share his stage this week.</TE>
<TE>   "The bikers and skaters come down and draw a big crowd," Mellem
said. "Then they also come over and watch the surfing."</TE>
<TE>   However, the Huntington Beach environment is not best for every
tour stop. "You couldn't do this at a place like Tahiti," Garcia
said.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere does little to lessen the goal of winning the
six-star surf contest, the highest-rated event on the World
Qualifying Series tour. But those who came to Huntington Beach this
week to compete in the skateboarding and BMX competitions said
winning this event is not as important as others on their schedules.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more like fun," said Brian Patch of Huntington Beach,
world record-holder with a skateboard jump of 58 feet. "Everybody
wants to win, but nobody takes it that seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Brennan of Huntington Beach, who makes a living performing
BMX jumping exhibitions at elementary schools, said this week's
competition is more rewarding for its accessibility.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not too often that you get to use a ramp for free on the
beach," he said. "It's doesn't get much better than this."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the moves limited to skateboard ramps in previous years
are now being tried on the waves, too. Surfers are completing
360-degree spins and other aerial tricks, and getting higher points
for their efforts. Two years ago, the Assn. of Surfing Professionals
began rewarding competitors for innovative and progressive surfing,
such as risky aerial moves. No longer do they look for long,
drawn-out rides, a maneuver traditionally used at beach breaks such
as Huntington Beach, where competitors used to struggle to ride the
whitewater to shore, hoping to receive points for a long ride.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Todd of Laguna Beach, Chris Drummy of San Juan Capistrano,
David Pinto of Dana Point and Micah Byrne of Huntington Beach won
their seventh-round heats Thursday to advance to today's round of 96
at the Philips U.S. Open of Surfing. Nathaniel Curran of Oxnard,
Henry Mills of Carpinteria, Gavin Beschen of San Clemente, Shaun
Burrell of Redondo Beach and Adam Virs of Ventura also transferred in
the four-to-six foot surf, which held up throughout the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Hamrock of Huntington Beach and Erica Hosseini of Newport
Beach advanced to today's round of 32 in the women's division.</TE>

<DH>Tennis: In her second tournament since knee surgery, she
beats Rubin to reach quarterfinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>One of the first things that came into focus when Chanda Rubin was
wheeled out of the operating room in Vail, Colo., after knee surgery
in January was a familiar face in an unexpected place.</LD>
<LD>   There was Lindsay Davenport. Certainly Davenport and Rubin have a
lot in common, both 26-year-old American tennis players, who have
represented the U.S. in Olympic and Fed Cup competition.</LD>
<LD>   The medical difference, however, was dramatic.</LD>
<TE>   Rubin had left knee surgery and was ready in time for the European
clay-court season. Davenport had complicated right knee surgery and
returned to the tour last week at Stanford, playing her first match
in nine months.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night was the first time Rubin and Davenport met on the
court since running into each other at the clinic, the Vail Valley
Medical Center. The third-seeded Davenport took the first meeting of
their competing comebacks, defeating No. 14 Rubin, 6-2, 2-6, 6-1, at
the Acura Classic at La Costa Resort and Spa in 1 hour 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The other top players advanced easily--defending champion and No.
1 Venus Williams defeated Anne Kremer, 6-3, 6-2, in 53 minutes and
No. 2 Jennifer Capriati beat Meghann Shaughnessy, 6-4, 6-1, in 67
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   For Davenport, the difference came in the first game of the third
set. Rubin was serving and had five game points, double faulting on
one, hitting a forehand volley wide and smacking an easy forehand
sitter in the net. Davenport capitalized on her first break-point
chance, taking it with a reflex forehand volley when Rubin's passing
shot clipped the net and popped in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "She gave me a lot of chances to get back in the game," Davenport
said.</TE>
<TE>   That slight opening was all Davenport needed to move into the
quarterfinals. Today she will meet Ai Sugiyama of Japan. Two weeks
into her comeback, she has reached the semifinals at Stanford and at
least the quarterfinals here.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm actually a little ahead," Davenport said of her
progress. "I didn't know what to expect. I'm happy with the way I'm
playing. I just don't think I'm all the way there, competing and
keeping my concentration. A lot of games, I was up and I'd miss two
returns or make two quick errors and she'd be up game point.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of concentrating throughout a match and concentrating in
games, I could be a little better. That will come, hopefully. To get
semis and this week, so far, quarters, I'm pretty happy with that."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's quick progress actually encouraged Davenport. But not in
those first few days when they were at the clinic in Vail.</TE>
<TE>   "She comes wheeling down after surgery in her wheelchair, all
drugged up, and I'm like, 'Hi!' " Davenport said. "We were there
together for about four or five days and she was making much faster
progress than I was. And it was really ticking me off. She left even
before I did."</TE>
<TE>   The Davenport-Rubin match was marked by cheers for Rubin, using
several variations of Rubin's first name. And, of course, there was
the obligatory cry of "Anna!" Anna Kournikova was not at the match.
Her loyal fan base was treated to an afternoon victory, though, as
she pulled out a 1-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory against Conchita Martinez of
Spain in the third round, despite being hampered by a tender left
leg.</TE>
<TE>   "It [the pain] is going slowly but surely down to my leg more than
my stomach," she said. "It was definitely more my leg today when I
woke up. In the first set, I was really, really stiff. I was a little
cautious. It was just in the back of my head. Once I got warmed up,
the blood flowing and it was fine."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez was complimentary of Kournikova's improved play.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be she was hitting without thinking," she said. "And
now she's patient and fighting a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez is one of the more difficult opponents on the tour
because of her shot selection and ability to change pace and spin.</TE>
<TE>   "Against somebody like Conchita, I have to end the points early,"
Kournikova said. "That's what she likes, is to make you tired. To
make you play as many points as possible. She really makes you move
on the court and work hard for the point. So I tried to end them as
soon as I can.</TE>
<TE>   "I never play that great against her. I don't have a great record
against her. She's always a tough player for me to play against.
Today I stayed patient"</TE>

<HD>Angel Broadcasts? Expect Delays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox is again opting for the Dodgers. Their game at Philadelphia on
Saturday at 10 a.m. is one of Fox's regional game-of-the-week
telecasts.</LD>
<LD>   But this time Fox is not snubbing the Angels. For one thing, the
Angel game against the New York Yankees on Saturday starts at 7 p.m.,
so it was not available to Fox. It will be televised locally on Fox
Sports Net.</LD>
<LD>   For another, Fox, which can't show one team more than nine times
during the regular season, has only one more Yankee game available.
Fox wants to save that one exposure until the final two weeks of the
season.</LD>
<TE>   However, Angel fans have more things to complain about. One is
that Sunday's 1 p.m. game against the Yankees isn't on television.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, it was a 5 p.m. game. Because it couldn't oppose
ESPN's Sunday night baseball, it wasn't scheduled for local
television. The start time was changed to 1 p.m. because the Angels
have to fly to Detroit for a make-up game Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Going into Sunday's game, the Angels will have been on television
for seven consecutive days. So maybe no television on Sunday is not a
big deal.</TE>
<TE>   But this is: Four Channel 9 road telecasts this month will be
tape-delayed, and the radio broadcasts will also be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Games at New York against the Yankees Aug. 20 and 22 will start at
4 p.m. PDT but shown at 5 p.m. It's the same for games Aug. 23 and 26
at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   This is setting a bad precedent. Channel 9 has always delayed
Laker telecasts from the East. Now, for the first time, it is doing
the same thing with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Pat McClenahan, station manager for both Channel 9 and new sister
station Channel 2, defends the move.</TE>
<TE>   "We can get a higher rating for a telecast that runs from 5-8 p.m.
than for a telecast that runs from 4-7 p.m.," he said. "They key is
the last hour.</TE>
<TE>   "The higher rating tells us we are servicing Angel fans by making
the games available at a time when more people can watch."</TE>
<TE>   McClenahan said he is aware an argument can be made that in an era
of VCRs and TiVo, the start time may not be as important as showing
games live. But he and his station are sticking with the tape-delay
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope there will be such an outcry, the practice will be
scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   And while we're at it, here's one more plea to scrap tape-delayed
Laker telecasts as well.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall Hospitalized</TE>
<TE>   Pat Summerall has been hospitalized since Tuesday in Los Angeles,
where he was attending Fox's annual seminar for NFL announcers.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall suffered some internal bleeding, which has since been
controlled. He is expected to be released and return home to Dallas
this weekend. Summerall's family has requested that the identity of
the hospital remain private.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall, although he has a new partner in Brian Baldinger, has
been retained as an NFL announcer by Fox. He'll announce mostly
Dallas games, but his first assignment is Arizona at Washington Sept.
8. He is expected to be ready for that assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Local Moves</TE>
<TE>   Channel 7 will promote Rob Fukuzaki to the position of No. 1
sports anchor, replacing Bill Weir, program director Bill Burton
said. Weir plans to leave the station sometime before his contract
expires in September to pursue other interests.</TE>
<TE>   Curt Sandoval will move up to Fukuzaki's weekend spot and the
station will hire a reporter to replace Sandoval.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 13 dumped weeknight sports anchor Michelle Bonner last
October, and now weekend anchor Geraud Moncure is gone. The station
will have news anchors reading the "Sports In a Minute" on weekends
now too, news director Larry Perret said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net will soon begin using national anchor Van Earl
Wright on the regional "Southern California Sports Report." He
replaces Todd Donoho, whose contract was not renewed. Donoho is now
at KSPN (1110) and KLOS-FM (95.5). Wright's former national partner,
Kevin Frazier, has moved on to ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a rarity: Fox Sports Net used two female anchors, Suzy
Shuster and Carolyn Hughes, for the first time on "Southern
California Sports Report" Tuesday through Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Cameras Everywhere</TE>
<TE>   It usually takes about 60 cameras to cover a NASCAR race. NBC will
use 79 to cover Sunday's Brickyard 400.</TE>
<TE>   Why so many cameras?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a combination of two things," NBC producer Sam Flood said.
"One, the event is obviously the biggest event on the calendar this
weekend. Secondly, Indianapolis Motor Speedway is unlike any other
track, and one camera cannot follow the leaders around the track."</TE>
<TE>   As if 79 cameras weren't enough, there's also In Demand's NASCAR's
In-Car supplemental pay package, which has been available on digital
cable since mid-June.</TE>
<TE>   The $99 package includes six channels with in-car cameras, plus a
seventh channel that offers statistical data.</TE>
<TE>   A complaint from subscribers is that when they're watching the
In-Car channels they can't follow the race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely for hard-core NASCAR fans who are looking for
something extra," said Jeffrey Pollock, the executive producer of the
package.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting Prospect</TE>
<TE>   ABC will televise the final of the Acura Classic women's tennis
tournament from La Costa Sunday at 1 p.m., with Terry Gannon and Pam
Shriver calling the action.</TE>
<TE>   Could it be Venus Williams vs. Anna Kournikova?</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great things about women's tennis is, no matter what,
you can bank on a marketable, fun final," Shriver said. "It makes my
job easy because there is always a story line."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Viewers will get their first look at the new team of Al Michaels
and John Madden Monday at 5 p.m., when ABC televises the Hall of Fame
game with the expansion Houston Texans playing the New York Giants.
... NBC's Jim Gray, a close friend of Al Davis, has been hired to do
the play-by-play on Raider preseason telecasts. ... HBO has hired
Sports Illustrated's Peter King as managing editor and reporter for
"Inside the NFL." ... A memorial service for Irv Kaze, scheduled for
Aug. 18 in the Turf Club at Hollywood Park, will begin at 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings may have been off for Monday's "Battle at Bighorn" on
ABC, but it was a great show. The star was Lee Trevino, even though
he was on the losing team. His constant chatter was a big hit.
Hopefully he'll be invited back. ... CBS has a special on first-time
winners on the PGA Tour Saturday at noon.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner War Emblem headlines Monmouth
Park's Haskell Invitational, which will be televised Sunday at 2 p.m.
on ESPN2 along with the Jim Dandy Stakes. War Emblem's trainer, Bob
Baffert, is getting married Saturday in San Diego, then taking a 5
a.m. flight Sunday to get to the track in Oceanport, N.J. The race is
the first for War Emblem since the death of owner Prince Ahmed bin
Salman.</TE>
<TE>   Race driver Tony Stewart has been hired as a commentator to work
three Busch Grand National races for TNT. He makes his debut
Saturday. ... The USA network has hired Jim Courier as a commentator
for tennis' U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended Viewing</TE>
<TE>   Need a lift? Check out the one-hour special on the Southern
California Special Olympics Saturday at noon on Fox Sports Net or
Sunday at 2 p.m. on Fox Sports Net 2. The event was held in June at
Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   The one-hour special, with hosts Bill Macdonald and former Miss
America Leanza Cornett, is outstanding. It presents a nice overview
and features several competitors. And it shows what is really
important in life.</TE>
<TE>   The special first aired last Sunday and will be repeated
throughout the month on both Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports Net 2.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   From Robert Wuhl, the creator and star of HBO's "Arli$$" who was a
guest on Fox Sports Net's "Sports Roundtable" show this week: "Why
would you want Ted Williams' DNA when you see what his kids are
like?"</TE>

<LD>Sacramento's Ruthie Bolton scored 20 points and Yolanda Griffith had
19 Thursday night as the Monarchs won their franchise-record sixth in
a row with an 80-71 victory over Utah.</LD>
<LD>   The Monarchs blew a 15-point lead in the second half before 6,905
at Sacramento, but Griffith and Tangela Smith, who had 19 points and
12 rebounds, led a late rally for the Monarchs, who made 23 of 24
free throws. Sacramento made an 11-3 run in the final 1:07,
highlighted by six points from Smith.</LD>
<LD>   Though Sacramento (10-16) won't make the playoffs, the Monarchs
prevented Utah (18-9) from clinching a postseason berth.</LD>

<HD>They're Rested, Ready and Facing 50</HD>
<DH>Sex, money and the meaning of life are dissected by four
men in the deftly written BBC America series 'Manchild.'</DH>

<LD>Call them knights in shining Armani. Or sexy beasts, if you must. But
please don't call them the male answer to "Sex and the City," for
they deserve to be judged on their own merits.</LD>
<LD>   They are the men of BBC America's "Manchild," four well-heeled
49-year-olds in the prime of their midlife crises who hit the Turkish
baths by day and the bars by night. With a wit drier than the Dom
Perignon this quartet consumes by the case, they speak their minds on
a range of topics: sex, relationships, money, sex, art, family, the
meaning of life and, last but not least, sex.</LD>
<LD>   Make no mistake, this goes beyond locker-room talk;
journalist-author Nick Fisher has written scripts that are incisive,
irreverent and surprisingly poignant. It also helps that the cast
delivers his hilariously profane lines with aplomb and that director
David Evans ties everything together stylishly in half-hour
installments.</LD>
<TE>   The show is narrated by Terry (Nigel Havers), who pathetically
tools around on a BMW motorbike and is dating a model half his age.
He presents the series' premise while lying on a massage table:</TE>
<TE>   "In a man's life, teens are a hormone-fueled quest for sex; 20s,
finding a wife and career; 30s, making serious money; 40s, unpicking
the unholy mess marriage, families and work have made of your life.
But time it right, and your 50s can once again be a full-time,
full-on hedonistic quest for pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the joke is that just as Terry states such grandiose
theories of masculinity, they often blow apart. After he says how
great it is to be footloose and fancy-free, we see the emotional
control his ex-wife and two kids exert--and how shallow his
relationship with a 25-year-old woman can be.</TE>
<TE>   His compatriot James (Anthony Stewart Head) is a cosmetic dentist
equally ready to sow some wild oats after a divorce. One problem:
James needs some repairs on a region far less visible than the teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick (Don Warrington) is the true epicurean of the group, an
eccentric who has remained single all these years. A bon vivant on
the outside, he is tormented on the inside over whether to keep his
mother on life support.</TE>
<TE>   The hapless Gary (Ray Burdis), by contrast, is a veritable Mr.
Stability: He's been married for 26 years and has a teenage son. Yet
when the lads paint the town red, Gary is torn between a puppy-dog
loyalty to his often shrewish wife, Cheryl (Lindsey Coulson), and a
mongrel-like urge to stray.</TE>
<TE>   If "Manchild" has one flaw, it's that the female characters don't
have the same depth as these four; instead, they are largely defined
by their ties to the men.</TE>
<TE>   But what else would you expect when one's "mate" is defined as a
buddy rather than a lover?</TE>
<TE>   The first four episodes of "Manchild" will air on BBC America
tonight starting at 5 (edited) and repeating at 9 (uncut). New
episodes begin next Friday. The network has rated it TV-MA (may be
unsuitable for children younger than 17).</TE>
