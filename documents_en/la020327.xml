<LD>Found your article regarding the increase in accidents among young
female drivers informative (Highway 1, Feb. 13). It's my belief that
a very significant contribution to this increase in accidents is
cell-phone distraction.</LD>
<LD>   I'm frequently frustrated by the inattentive behavior of drivers
who have 20 years of experience behind the wheel and can't control
their car because they're on a cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   There's no way newly licensed teen drivers using cell phones in
the car can even be slightly protected by the rote driving that many
adults slide by on.</LD>
<TE>   Since it's parents mostly paying the insurance premiums for their
young adult drivers, you might want to recommend that they implement
a "no-cell-phone-while-driving" rule.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to enforce?</TE>
<TE>   No, just call them at random times while they are out driving. If
they answer the phone, suspend the privilege of driving, or the cell
phone, or both. It might save their life, or someone else's.</TE>

<TE>   I was excited to read about General Motors Corp.'s new
"Skateboard" design (Highway 1, Jan. 23), and dismayed by the car
manufacturer's old story about how it can't meet the zero-emission
dates.</TE>
<TE>   They've had many years to work on this problem, but in the article
you quote executives and industry experts who say it could be 30 or
more years before the transition from internal-combustion engines to
hydrogen is possible!</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, when the entire computer memory for the Apollo
program had as much capability as a hand-held digital organizer does
today, we built rockets that took us to the moon and did it in less
than 10 years.</TE>

<TE>   Reader Larry Pike stated that he would favor "a car with a top
speed of 75 mph" (Highway 1, Jan. 30). Is that with only the driver
in the vehicle, or with passengers? Is that with an empty trunk or a
full one?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Pike said, "In the hands of some freeway drivers, a car
at 65 mph is too dangerous." A car is potently dangerous at almost
any speed. Therefore, I do not believe that limiting the horsepower
in new vehicles is the solution for making our highways safer.</TE>

<HD>VW, Toyota Top Recall Reminder List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp. topped the list of vehicle recall
reminders announced this month by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration in its campaign to increase owner response to the
safety alerts.</LD>
<LD>   NHTSA said Volkswagen is recalling 311,047 Passat and Jetta sedans
to fix a fuel tank filler problem and 55,000 cars to repair brakes
that can catch fire.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota's recall involves 273,743 of its popular 4Runner sport
utility vehicles, some with weak rear suspensions that could add to
loss of control if the vehicle is overloaded.</LD>
<TE>   The recalls first were reported in January. NHTSA, concerned that
almost 30% of recalled vehicles are not repaired, issues a monthly
reminder of recalls, originally announced up to 10 weeks earlier, to
alert consumers who might have ignored or been skipped by
manufacturers' initial notices.</TE>
<TE>   Other January recalls in NHTSA's monthly reminder:</TE>
<TE>   * The Land Rover unit of Ford Motor Co. said that 55,505 of its
Discovery II SUVs built between April 1998 and July 2001 have a
faulty anti-lock brake control unit and that 64,925 Discovery II
models built between April 1998 and January of this year have
accelerator cables that can weaken and break. Recall notices began
going out in February.</TE>
<TE>   * Chrysler Group said it would recall 71,677 of its 2002 model
Jeep Grand Cherokees to modify a fuel tank guard that can knock off a
tank-mounted vapor recovery control valve during a crash, possibly
causing a fuel leak. Chrysler has not notified NHTSA of its owner
notification schedule.</TE>
<TE>   * Saab Cars USA said it would recall 2,601 of its 9-5 models built
between September and November 2001 to inspect for, and repair if
necessary, a defective steering system part. Saab began notifying
owners of the 2002 model year cars in mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   * Harley-Davidson Co. said it was recalling 26,949 motorcycles
built in October and November to inspect for, and replace if needed,
a wiring clip that can detach from the front fender, causing a wire
to fray and blow out the main lighting system fuse. The company was
to begin notifying customers last month.</TE>
<TE>   The large VW recall campaign involves 1998 through 2000 model year
Passats and 1997-99 Jettas. The cars have weak-walled rear wheel
liners that could fail to protect the fuel filler tube from damage if
a tire were to blow and disintegrate. The repair involves installing
stronger wheel well liners.</TE>
<TE>   VW's smaller recall involves New Beetles, Jettas and Golfs built
from October 2000 to September 2001. NHTSA said the anti-lock brake
system control unit could suffer an electrical short and catch fire.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's recall involves rear suspension parts on two-wheel-drive
4Runners built between November 1995 and February 1998, but the
company is calling in all 4Runners built during that time, including
four-wheel-drive models, to avoid customer confusion about which are
affected.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota said that when the two-wheel-drive models are heavily
loaded in the rear, abrupt steering maneuvers could lead to loss of
control. The repair for affected models is replacement of certain
rear suspension parts. Customer notification began in November.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More information about recalls can be obtained online at www
.nhtsa.dot.gov or by calling the NHTSA hot line at (888) 327-4236.</TE>

<HD>Saturn, Honda Showing Off Their New Directions at New York
Auto Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES and JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starved of product for years while parent General Motors concentrated
on developing its truck lineup, Saturn finally is being given a
chance to hit its stride with a stable of new and redesigned
vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   At the New York International Auto Show today, Saturn pulls the
wraps off the all-new ION compact, a replacement for its S-Series
cars that have a popular following but have changed little in a
decade. The company also plans to show off a major overhaul of the
mid-size L-Series, whose sales have fallen short of hopes.</LD>
<LD>   The ION comes as a sedan or coupe and features a center-mounted
instrument cluster that faces the driver, allows more leeway in
adjusting the steering wheel and puts the dials on a level with the
rearview mirrors.</LD>
<TE>   The new model also has removable roof rails, or strips above the
doors, that can be unscrewed and replaced--or repainted--to customize
the look of the car, a feature expected to be popular with younger
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Small half-width doors behind the main doors on both sides permit
easier access to the rear seats in what Saturn calls a "quad coupe"
configuration. The rear and front passenger seats fold flat, leaving
a surface that can hold a 9-foot surfboard even with all the doors
closed.</TE>
<TE>   Engines for the ION are a 1.9- liter, 125-horsepower four-cylinder
and the 2.2-liter, 140-horsepower V-6 shared by the L-Series and
Saturn's recently arrived VUE sport utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The L-Series, widely criticized for its bland styling, has been
revamped with new front and rear fascia featuring projection low-beam
headlamps in front and starburst-pattern taillights. Sixteen-inch
wheels will be available, and with the wagon, a chrome rear handle
and chrome roof rack rails.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Lajdziak, Saturn's vice president for marketing, says she is
looking to the renewed portfolio to increase sales this year by
20%--or about 312,000 vehicles. That would make 2002 a record year.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's Element</TE>
<TE>   American Honda Motor Co. will use the New York show today to
announce that the production version of its Model X "dorm room on
wheels" concept will be called the Element.</TE>
<TE>   The Element packs features of a pickup truck and an SUV into a
boxy shape that Honda believes will appeal to a hip, young audience
looking for a true all-purpose vehicle capable of hauling four people
and all their gear for biking, surfing or whatever.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to an easy-cleaning interior (a must for any dorm
room), a key design feature of the Element is the center-opening
"barn" doors with no B-pillar--for maximum cargo-loading flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   Honda says the Element will be priced from $16,000 to $21,000 and
will come in all-wheel-drive or front-wheel-drive versions with
five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission options. It
will be built in Ohio off Honda's Global Compact Platform and will be
powered by a 2.4-liter, 160-horsepower four-cylinder engine.</TE>
<TE>   Sales are scheduled to begin in December, and Honda executives say
they expect to sell 50,000 a year.</TE>

<HD>A Civic Duty: Check Out Hondas</HD>
<DH>The company's mighty mite of the mid-'90s is a solid option
for inexpensive transportation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT DOGGETT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Used-car shoppers often are advised to buy the newest model they can
afford.</LD>
<LD>   But budget-conscious consumers seeking a pre-owned Civic should
disregard that aphorism and instead focus on the wide selection of
Civics created during Bill and Hillary's first term, the 1992-95
models.</LD>
<LD>   The reasons are many, and among the most important are cost,
quality and abundance of aftermarket parts.</LD>
<TE>   Honda introduced the now ubiquitous Civic in 1973, the same year
eight cents bought you a first-class postage stamp. The original
Civic cost about $2,000 and came as either a two-door sedan or a
three-door hatchback, both little bigger than a shoebox and barely
more impact-resistant.</TE>
<TE>   Among the swollen sedans, muscle cars and station wagons that
ruled U.S. roads back then, the puny 50-horsepower Civics were the
butt of many jokes--until gasoline prices started chasing Skylab in
October '73. Suddenly, the EPA mileage champion Hondas didn't look so
silly.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic received its first overhaul in 1980, getting a larger
engine and 13% more interior room. A year later, a sedan model
entered the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The third generation of Civics debuted in 1984 and featured
sportier styling, fuel injection and the two-seater CRX.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-generation Civic premiered in 1988 and was the first
produced domestically--at Honda's plant in Ohio. Major improvements
had been made to the chassis, motor, clutch and suspension, and
offerings now included a four-wheel-drive wagon. Power ranged from 70
horses in the base engine to 105 in the wagon and sporty CRX Si
models.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to 1992 and Civic, Generation Five. The '92 Civic
featured an all-new body and came in a three-door hatchback and
four-door sedan with a wide selection of engines and amenities. Gone
were the CRX and the wagon.</TE>
<TE>   Also gone was the old ride, which compared with the new seemed a
case study in vibration. The Gen5 Civics' solid ride was produced, in
part, by improved aerodynamics, longer wheel bases and a new front
suspension. A driver's side airbag and ventilated front disc brakes,
standard on all '92 Civics, helped make it a safer car.</TE>
<TE>   Those improvements and Honda's reputation for reliability make
1992-95 Civics a good choice for those seeking solid transportation
in the used-car market.</TE>
<TE>   But the Gen5 Civic also has appeal for the younger buyer seeking
an affordable car that can be personalized.</TE>
<TE>   There are zillions of low-cost aftermarket parts for the '92-'95
models; you don't have to take on a roommate to be able to
personalize one with custom body kits, taillights and the like.
Performance-enhancing parts also are relatively cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask members of Team Import Revolution, a car club that uses I
&amp; R Auto Accessories in Los Angeles as its base of operations. Almost
all drive Civics, and most of those are '92-'95s for reasons
previously mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Most team members have replaced their stock mufflers for
aftermarket ones for that street racer sound, and some have spent
thousands of dollars on custom seats, sound systems, spiffy wheels
and the like.</TE>
<TE>   It's easier to find the cash to pay for custom equipment when the
base product is relatively inexpensive.</TE>
<TE>   Private-party prices for the oldest of these pre-owned vehicles,
the 1992 models, typically range from $1,700 for a CX hatchback in
good condition to $2,750 for a healthy EX sedan; expect to pay $500
to $1,000 more if you get your '92 Civic from a dealership.</TE>
<TE>   For the 1992 model year, Civics came in seven models: the CX, DX,
VX and Si hatchbacks (priced at $8,100, $9,850, $10,550 and $11,900,
respectively), and the DX, LX and EX four-door sedans ($10,555,
$11,385 and $13,575). A five-speed manual transmission was standard;
a four-speed automatic was available in the DX hatchback and all
three sedans for $800.</TE>
<TE>   The CX came with a 1.5-liter, 70-horsepower, 8-valve engine; the
DX with a 102-horsepower, 16-valve version of the same engine; and
the VX with a 92-horsepower, 16-valve version with variable timing
for better fuel efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   The EX and Si models were sold with a more powerful
125-horsepower, 1.6-liter, 16-valve four-banger with variable timing.</TE>
<TE>   The high-performance Si also has rack-and-pinion steering, power
mirrors and cruise control.</TE>
<TE>   Among the sedans, the LX and EX models came with power windows and
door locks, cruise control, a digital clock, a tachometer, and a
front center armrest with storage compartment. All three sedans have
power steering.</TE>
<TE>   All Civic models from 1992 through '95 also have Honda's genetic
reliability and enviable gas mileage, typically ranging from 27 miles
per gallon in the city and 34 mpg on the highway for the EX sedan
with automatic transmission to a whopping 48 mpg city and 55 mpg
highway for the VX hatchback with a stick. Wear and tear on the
engines, of course, can affect those mileage ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Few changes were made to the Civic in 1993, but DX and EX coupes
were added to the lineup. Today, these coupes generally fetch $2,700
and $3,600, respectively, from a private party for well-maintained
specimens, while all other '93 Civic models typically command $500
more than their '92 counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   All Civics came equipped with dual front airbags starting in 1994,
and the line received other refinements in '94 and '95 before a major
redesign launched the sixth generation in 1996. Honda this year
introduced a redesigned seventh-generation Civic as an '02 model.</TE>
<TE>   Private-party prices for '94 Civics in good condition typically
run from $2,900 for a CX hatchback to $4,675 for the EX sedan.</TE>
<TE>   To bump up to '95 models, add $600 for the CX and about $900 for
the EX. Dealers generally get $1,000 to $1,700 more for the '95
models.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Tang, owner of T-1 Motorsports of Los Angeles and a longtime
Civic mechanic, says for performance improvement it's better to buy a
cheap, fifth-generation Civic with high miles and then put in a fast
aftermarket motor, than modify an existing stock motor.</TE>
<TE>   The aftermarket motors come with up to 220 horsepower and cost
less than rebuilding the stock engine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with Civics from model years 1996 and beyond is that
there are fewer aftermarket parts available for them, so maintenance
and modifications cost more.</TE>
<TE>   If you think you've found the Civic of your dreams, do the
following: Inspect it for overspray--paint where paint doesn't
belong, such as on suspension parts--the No. 1 giveaway that a car's
been in an accident; have an independent garage or a Honda dealership
do compression and leak tests and ask for a damage inspection (most
dealerships charge $75 to $100 for these services); and get a vehicle
history report from a service such as Carfax.com, which provides
unlimited reports over a two-month period for a $20 fee.</TE>

<LD>Identifying good drivers and bad drivers is critical to maintaining
safe highways. But California's system--operated by multiple
government agencies and private companies--appears hobbled by
loopholes, troubled by a lack of common standards and not always able
to deliver equal justice.</LD>
<LD>   Most drivers know about the system in which accidents and
citations are counted as points on their driving record. But which
record and whose points?</LD>
<LD>   It turns out that two agencies in California have point systems
that operate for different purposes and under different sections of
state law.</LD>
<TE>   The Department of Motor Vehicles is the point keeper when it comes
to identifying negligent drivers. And it is the DMV that makes the
decision to revoke a license.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Insurance is the agency that operates the point
system used to determine who gets a good-driver discount and who can
be denied insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous local police agencies and private insurance companies
decide to award points that are tabulated and put on computerized
databases operated by the two agencies. But not all the police and
insurers are on the same wavelength when they forward data to
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The way the DMV and the insurance department operate their point
systems and how they decide what counts as a point is different. In
many cases the two systems overlap, but sometimes they operate in
separate universes.</TE>
<TE>   The systems can fail to catch all information on a problem driver
and can impose tougher sanctions on drivers in some jurisdictions
than on equally bad drivers in other jurisdictions. In some cases,
drivers can get points even when there is no verdict or admission of
guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV gets reports of vehicle accidents from the Statewide
Integrated Traffic Records System, a database operated by the
California Highway Patrol. The accident reports generally include a
finding of fault, which is used by the DMV to assess points even when
there is no court conviction.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV also adds points to driving records based on moving
violations that do not involve accidents. It obtains that data from
old-fashioned computer tapes generated by municipal court systems,
which themselves are backwaters of information technology.</TE>
<TE>   Under the DMV system, accidents, speeding or other similar moving
violations contribute one point to a driver's record, said Jacqueline
Zeigler, program administrator for driver safety at DMV headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   A conviction for driving under the influence contributes two
points. The DMV can suspend a license when a driver gets four points
in 12 months, six points in 24 months or eight points in 36 months.</TE>
<TE>   At-fault accidents count as one point, but the DMV acknowledges
that it doesn't know about all accidents. Many police agencies do not
go to the scene of an accident unless there are injuries, meaning no
report is written.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists are supposed to notify the DMV of all accidents, a
requirement that is widely disregarded, Zeigler said. In those cases,
the driver is "off the hook for the point count," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another inconsistency is that some police agencies refuse to issue
a citation for an accident unless a police officer was a witness,
while other police agencies aggressively issue citations solely based
on after-the-fact evidence and statements taken by the investigating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the folks at the Department of Insurance have their own
system to award discounts for good drivers, a standard 20% reduction
of the premium if the driver has at most one point on his or her
record.</TE>
<TE>   That system is based on insurance companies' reporting of their
customers' accidents and violation records.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows exactly how many drivers get the good-driver
discount--another remarkable information void in the system.</TE>
<TE>   According to one Insurance Department official, the agency
believes 93% of all California drivers get the discount.</TE>
<TE>   But industry officials say such a high figure is impossible
because teenagers, who don't qualify for the discount, make up more
than 7% of drivers in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, insurers may issue a point based on the DMV
violations records and on their own determination of fault in
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   But the way insurers determine fault is far different from the way
police agencies do so.</TE>
<TE>   So the DMV can assess a point against a driver for an accident,
basing its decision on police reports, but the insurer can determine
that the driver was not at fault in the same accident and decide not
to assess a point, said Bruce Patton, staff counsel at the Insurance
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, a driver can get zapped for an insurance premium
increase under state law and still qualify for the good-driver
discount on the higher bill, said Pete Moraga, a spokesman for the
Insurance Information Network of California. Even a so-called good
driver can be surcharged for one accident and keep the good-driver
designation.</TE>
<TE>   Moraga acknowledges that the system is complex, though he added:
"I don't think it is as bad as the tax code."</TE>

<HD>'Peter Gunn,' the Suave Private Eye</HD>
<DH>Television* Blake Edwards reminisces about the
jazz-drenched series he created for TV with Henry Mancini in 1958.
Episodes are out now on DVD.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Peter Gunn" is today best known as the driving jazz theme that won,
for composer Henry Mancini, the very first Grammy ever awarded for
album of the year (1958).</LD>
<LD>   What few people remember is that "Peter Gunn" was also a popular
TV detective series. In fact, the show catapulted both Mancini and
its creator-producer, Blake Edwards, into feature-film careers.
Thirty-two episodes of the series, which starred Craig Stevens, were
released on DVD Tuesday by A&amp;E Home Video.</LD>
<LD>   "'Dragnet' was TV's first important detective show, but it had
been a radio show before that," says Ric Meyers, author of "Murder on
the Air." "'Peter Gunn' was the first important mystery show to be
created specifically for television."</LD>
<TE>   And in 1958, it was a sensation, as much for its stylish look and
attitude as for its groundbreaking jazz score. It won eight Emmy
nominations in its first season , including nods for all four members
of its cast; two for Edwards' script and direction on the pilot;
Mancini, for his music; and as best dramatic series.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens played the title character, a suave and sophisticated guy
whose wit was as sharp as his wardrobe--but who didn't seem to have
an office. Clients generally found him at Mother's, a waterfront
nightspot where his girlfriend, singer Edie Hart (Lola Albright),
performed.</TE>
<TE>   Proprietor Mother was played by Hope Emerson in the first season,
Minerva Urecal in the second. Gunn was friendly, but just as often at
odds, with sourpuss police Lt. Jacoby (Herschel Bernardi).</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere was decidedly noir, with colorful characters, dimly
lighted streets and plenty of mayhem. "I wanted a fantasy kind of
quality for that world," Edwards recalls. "I liked being in
Gunnsville, as we called it, on the wet streets, constructing our own
kind of jazzy, dark environment."</TE>
<TE>   For radio, Edwards had created another detective series, "Richard
Diamond," with Dick Powell as the star. Stevens, who at the time was
"sort of a limp, second leading man at Warner Bros.," Edwards says,
reminded him of Powell's own cast-against-type transition from '30s
singing star to tough-guy detective in the 1944 film "Murder, My
Sweet."</TE>
<TE>   "He had a certain sophistication and a great sense of humor, a
unique appeal that is hard to define," Edwards says. Once the actor
signed, Edwards says he told him two things: "I want to take you to
my tailor, because I think the character should set a style,
clothes-wise. I don't want him as part of the underworld, visually.
And I want to cut all your hair off; I want to give you a 'butch.'"</TE>
<TE>   Gunn's short hair and classy attire set him apart from the Philip
Marlowes and Mike Hammers of the time; the settings may have been
seedy but the protagonist was not.</TE>
<TE>   That, to historian Meyers, was a key factor. "It was relevant but
old-fashioned, avant-garde but familiar," he says. "It had the solid
scripting of a radio drama and a film noir look. Gunn was a
combination of the hard-boiled private eye and the gentleman
detective. [Edwards] had all of these wild and crazy characters, and
this very calm, crew-cut rock of a guy [in Gunn]. Nothing ever seemed
to ruffle him."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens and Albright</TE>
<TE>   Made Beautiful Music</TE>
<TE>   Stevens' chemistry with Albright was also remarkable. The two
would often play love scenes with a minimum of cryptic dialogue,
always with the clear implication that there was a lot going on
after-hours at Pete's pad. Interestingly, she didn't have a great
singing voice.</TE>
<TE>   "She was perfect casting for that role because she had an
off-the-cuff kind of jazz delivery that was very hard to find," Henry
Mancini said in a 1992 interview. "Just enough to believe that she'd
be singing in that club and that she shouldn't be on Broadway or
doing movies."</TE>
<TE>   At least half the success of "Peter Gunn," Edwards says, was
attributable to Mancini's contribution. To Mancini, though, the
approach was obvious. "Mother's was a jazz club, and I think the
minute that hit, the rest of it fell into place. I could think of
nothing else to put in.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't want to use any strings. That band--we only
had 11 men in the 'Peter Gunn' band--had some unique sounds that
people are still using. Unique playing techniques, fall-offs on the
ends of notes, the use of alto flutes and bass flutes for dramatic
purposes."</TE>
<TE>   The music was immensely popular. Two RCA albums sold millions,
brought wide public attention to TV scoring for the first time, and
ushered in an entire era of jazz for private eyes. Within a year,
detectives were all over the tube, all with jazz accompaniment.
(Edwards left his agency, MCA, in a row over its TV studio Revue's
all-too-similar 1959 show, "Johnny Staccato," starring John
Cassavetes.) Because of Edwards' growing involvement with movies,
notably "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961) and "Experiment in Terror"
(1962), "Peter Gunn" lasted just three seasons. It enjoyed a brief
run in syndication (locally, on KDOC-TV in the 1980s). A&amp;E expects to
release all 114 half-hour episodes on DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards tried twice to revive the show, first in 1967 with a
feature film starring Stevens, then in 1989 with a TV movie starring
Peter Strauss. Mancini died in 1994, Stevens in 2000. Now, Edwards'
son Geoffrey is attempting a fresh spin on the old concept,
developing a two-hour TV movie that would serve as a series
prototype.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the right time," says Geoffrey Edwards, noting that
"martinis and thick steaks and cigars are back with a vengeance." The
revised "Gunn," he says, would still be a music-driven crime drama,
"dark and hip, with a beautiful noir quality that's going to appeal
to the [younger] demographic."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Blake Edwards says that he didn't set out to create
a landmark in TV: "I just did the best I could, had the most fun with
it that I could have, and hoped it would be a huge success and make
me a lot of money. It was a huge success. It didn't make me a lot of
money."</TE>

<HD>Chamber Society Revels in Ives' Iconoclasm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society turned to
Americana on Monday night at the Skirball Center's Ahmanson Hall--and
in doing so, took a nicely creative risk with that patron saint of
iconoclasm, Charles Ives.</LD>
<LD>   Written when he was only 21, the String Quartet No. 1 explodes the
image of Ives as an inspired crank, for it displays a real mastery of
traditional forms as well as a desire to go outside the box.</LD>
<LD>   Later, he lifted the first-movement Fugue out of the four-movement
quartet and placed it in slightly expanded form into his Symphony No.
4.</LD>
<TE>   For this unique performance, violinists Barry Socher and Ingrid
Chun, violist Dale Hikawa and cellist David Garrett played the
three-movement edition of the quartet as per Ives' last wishes, added
a brief, jokey Ives Scherzo as a buffer, and closed with Socher's own
string-quartet transcription of the symphony's version of the Fugue.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Fugue might have fit better in its original spot at
the beginning of the quartet, this sequence was more in tune with
Ives' quirky nature, and this foursome poured a sense of lift and
intense feeling into the performance.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta Read Thomas' revised Piano Trio now bears the title "Angel
Chant," although judging from this mostly morose, occasionally
lyrical score, these particular angels seemed to have been in a
mournfully downcast mood.</TE>
<TE>   Violinist Mark Baranov, cellist Barry Gold and pianist Lina
Targonsky did the honors.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Barber's works occupied the leadoff spot in both halves.
First there was a brisk performance of his agreeable, slightly
melancholic "Summer Music" for wind quintet, and later, a warm,
relaxed, engagingly natural interpretation of "Dover Beach" by
baritone Nathan Gunn with string quartet.</TE>

<LD>For every white man who had the experience and skills to do the job
but wasn't hired because the boss had to hire a black and compensate
for past injustices, Russell Crowe is now our new poster boy.</LD>
<LD>   Almost everyone at the academy knew that the performance Crowe
gave in "A Beautiful Mind" far surpassed Denzel Washington's
performance in "Training Day." But to please the PC crowd and make up
for past injustices to blacks, Denzel got the Oscar.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the next time Russell is nominated and even if his
performance isn't as good as the other nominees, the academy will
give him a "makeup Oscar."</LD>
<TE>   And I really thought that after Sept. 11, America would have moved
forward.</TE>
<TE>   ROBIN HOWARD</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's get over it now. The best actor and best actress awards
at the Academy Awards went to Denzel Washington and Halle Berry.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going to name those two artists in the politically correct
term that so many people would wish me to use. Berry and Washington
happen to have dark skin. I know that there are so many people out
there who want to call this an achievement over perceived racism in
Hollywood, and I think that is such bull. These two people now have
possession of Oscar statues because their acting skills were
deserving of such. Their skin color had nothing to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   I fall into the human category of what many people call a WASP,
and I hate that term, so don't call me that anymore, and let me revel
in the fact that an actor and an actress who I enjoy watching, two
people who have darker skin than me, were honored for their skills.</TE>
<TE>   MIKE BULTSMA</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How is it a film ("A Beautiful Mind") that wins for best film,
best director (Ron Howard), best screenplay adaptation (Akiva
Goldsman) and best supporting actress (Jennifer Connelly) fails to
garner a win for best actor (Russell Crowe)? I am stunned,
disappointed and dismayed at the academy's choice of Denzel
Washington for his performance in "Training Day."</TE>
<TE>   If it were not for Crowe's magnificent portrayal of the brilliant
John Nash, would Howard, Connelly, Goldsman and producer Brian Grazer
have received recognition?</TE>
<TE>   Crowe was John Nash. I am not a Russell Crowe fan but his acting
was brilliant. Is it possible that since he won best actor last year
for "Gladiator," the academy collectively decided to overlook him?</TE>
<TE>   LAUREN KUCKELMAN</TE>
<TE>   West Covina</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am very happy that Halle Berry and Denzel Washington took top
honors at the Academy Awards, not to mention the lifetime achievement
award given to Sidney Poitier, because now blacks will stop
complaining about how they are not given opportunities in the
entertainment industry. I am just tired of hearing about it and the
conversation is now over!</TE>
<TE>   To those blacks who want to continue living with victim mentality,
I have three words for you: Halle and Denzel.</TE>
<TE>   R. M. LEWISTON</TE>
<TE>   Brea</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was a little disappointed with Halle Berry's acceptance speech.
I think she sold her peers short and left the impression that she was
being recognized as a black actress and that Hollywood was making
amends for years of racial bias.</TE>
<TE>   In my opinion, Berry gave one of the strongest performances I have
ever seen on the screen. Her performance left me with hope for all
actors and actresses. She set an example of what can be and should
be, transforming self and portraying some of the most intense human
emotions in a profound and straightforward manner.</TE>
<TE>   I agree that this award marks a first for the African American
community; however, it was earned through personal strength and
ability, not social responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL HENDERSON</TE>
<TE>   El Monte</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In her acceptance speech, Halle Berry stated that her Academy
Award was, in part, for "the nameless, faceless women of color who
now stand a chance tonight because the door has been opened." Is
Berry saying that until 2002, Hollywood, the bastion of liberal
political correctness and Democratic Party fund-raising, was racist?</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL H. BARTON</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a year when the motion picture academy demonstrates so clearly
that it honors artists on the basis of their talent without regard to
skin color, it is unseemly for a principal recipient of the award to
suggest that the door for an award has been closed to black actors.</TE>
<TE>   There is no data to support anyone's notion of having not won
either a nomination or the award because of skin color. For every
Denzel Washington who didn't win in prior years ("The Hurricane,"
1999), there's a Steven Spielberg who also thought he should have won
for previous films ("The Color Purple," 1985; "Amistad," 1997).</TE>
<TE>   JAKE ANGELIN</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am amazed at the emphatic reaction of those who feel the Oscars
were a triumph for the African American population. These
overreactive liberals should quit making this a race issue. Denzel
Washington and Halle Berry won their awards on merit and consistent
talent alone, and those people who try to read any further into this
are just kidding themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Let us stop sorting America into races; we are all Americans,
whatever the color of our skin. Let it be. We are living in 2002, not
1902.</TE>

<LD>   Judge Rejects Fox Suit Over Zahn's Defection</LD>
<LD>   A New York judge has dismissed Fox News' lawsuit against the
agency representing news anchor Paula Zahn, ruling that it had not
interfered in her contract before she jumped to CNN in September.</LD>
<TE>   Though Zahn had been signed with Fox through February 2002, State
Justice Ira Gammerman maintained she was "free to negotiate with
rival networks at any time, so long as she gave Fox the opportunity
to decide whether or not to match any offers obtained."</TE>
<TE>   Zahn notified Fox, he said. But instead of matching the CNN offer,
the network terminated Zahn's employment after learning that her
agent had been negotiating with its competitor.</TE>
<TE>   "Fox could have sought a 'first negotiation' clause which would

<TE>   TV Academy Picks Six New Hall of Famers</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences has chosen six new
small-screen heavyweights for induction into its Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Three veterans of "The Carol Burnett Show" made the list:
performers Harvey Korman and Tim Conway, and costume designer Bob
Mackie.</TE>
<TE>   Also chosen were Jean Stapleton, who played Edith Bunker on "All
in the Family"; John Frankenheimer, who directed more than 150 live
programs during in the 1950s, and producer Bud Yorkin, who teamed
with Norman Lear on "All in the Family," "Maude," "Good Times" and

<TE>   Another Singer Quits Rage Against Machine</TE>
<TE>   Rage Against the Machine has broken down again. Singer Chris
Cornell has parted ways with the celebrated Los Angeles rock band
before ever performing in public with the group, according to his
manager.</TE>
<TE>   The surprising news comes just 10 months after Cornell, the former
frontman of Soundgarden, stepped into the Rage ranks to replace
departed vocalist Zack de la Rocha and just three months before the
reconstituted Rage was to debut on stage on the Ozzfest tour.</TE>
<TE>   That tour, which includes an Aug. 31 stop at Glen Helen
Blockbuster Pavilion, will now go on without any Rage incarnation,
according to Cornell manager Jim Guerinot.</TE>
<TE>   The fleeting Cornell-era of Rage apparently will exist only on CD.
While Guerinot declined Tuesday to detail the split, he did say plans
are still in place for a spring release of the Rage album that
features the truncated labors of Cornell, guitarist Tom Morello,
bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk.</TE>
<TE>   Original singer De la Rocha, meanwhile, continues working on a
solo project that has no release date set.</TE>

<TE>   Revived Broadway Returns Part of Bailout</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of an unexpectedly fast recovery, the League of
American Theatres and Producers gave back $1 million of a
$2.5-million bailout from the city of New York on Monday--funding it
received after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The stipend had been used to purchase tickets for the Twin Towers
Fund and programs promoting tourism to 11 Broadway shows facing a
bleak winter. Many of those productions are now enjoying profitable
weeks, triggering the payback.</TE>
<TE>   According to Newsday, the $1 million will go to needy arts
organizations such as the Center for Arts Education, the New York
Foundation for the Arts, the American Music Center and the Alliance
of Resident Theaters/New York.</TE>

<TE>   More Films Are Marked for Preservation</TE>
<TE>   Harold Lloyd's 1918 short "The Tip" and clandestinely shot footage
of Jewish refugees aboard the ship Exodus in 1947 are among the 39
films to be preserved through grants announced Tuesday by the
National Film Preservation Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The federally funded prizes are intended to help archives
nationwide save American "orphan films" not preserved by commercial
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Other "culturally significant" movies slotted for preservation
include William S. Hart's first western feature, "The Bargain"
(1914), shot in the Grand Canyon; "Bermuda to Baltimore" (1937),
celebrating the inaugural flight of Pan Am's Bermuda Clipper; a 1932
industrial short explaining how to sell Palm Beach suits; home movies
by the Ansel Adams family in New Mexico in 1929; and "White Water and
Black Magic," (1938-39), which documents an Amazon expedition.</TE>
<TE>   "Films are the living record of our country's history--the
day-to-day lives of ordinary people recorded in a fashion not
possible before the 20th century," said the Writers Guild of
America's Richard Wesley, who served on the panel.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Billy Bob Thornton will be performing with his band at the El Rey
Theatre on May 17 in support of his album "Private Radio"--the first
performance in a two-week, eight-city tour of the U.S. Tickets go on
sale April 13.... The London Times reports that actress Glenda
Jackson was hospitalized after seriously injuring her hip and wrist
in a fall.... ABC, which has been airing James Bond pictures in
chronological order, has canceled the Saturday night offerings
because of poor ratings, Variety reports. The leftovers may surface
on the network this summer, after which broadcast rights go to
Viacom's TNN, CBS and UPN....MGM plans a brief theatrical re-release
of "No Man's Land," the Bosnian project that won the Oscar for best
foreign-language film, shortly before it comes out on video in April,
Variety reports.</TE>

<HD>ICE Weaves Vision Into the Music</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One might suspect an attitude flippant and/or trippy from an ensemble
known as Intergalactic Contemporary Ensemble, a.k.a. ICE. But what
the Minneapolis-based group instead demonstrated, in its Monday
Evening Concerts program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art this
week, was solid musical cohesion and serious vision. What's in a
name?</LD>
<LD>   Music from different corners of the American landscape, from a
film score to the private world of expatriate Conlon Nancarrow,
bookended the program. To open, Thomas Newman's fascinating score for
"American Beauty," arranged by ICE conductor Duane Schulthess, had
its West Coast premiere.</LD>
<LD>   Newman's 1999 work, with its use of marimbas, twisted touches of
Americana (including dulcimer) and carefully interlaced parts,
followed a post-minimalist scheme and translated well to the concert
stage.</LD>
<TE>   Closing the program was Nancarrow's "Study for Player Piano, No.
7," in an arrangement by Charles Schwobel and Yvar Mikhashoff. It was
the fiendish complexity of Nancarrow's music, full of polyrhythms,
polytonality, and poly-everything that led him to rely on the player
piano for decades.</TE>
<TE>   The music's tricky maze, fleshed out by varying instrumental
colors, proved uniquely exciting. Its finale was a show stealer.
"Requiem for a Dancer" was a stylistically restless, smartly laid-out
musical canvas by Dorrance Stalvey. ICE's resident composer, Edie
Hill, explored sonic and symbolic metamorphosis in "Butterfly
Effect." Minneapolis-based Zeitgeist also appeared, navigating the
intricate clapping adventure of Mary Ellen Childs' "Hands."</TE>

<HD>Opening a Door to Panic Rooms</HD>
<DH>The shelters, like the one at the center of the new Jodie
Foster thriller, seem to be all the rage--for those who can afford
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In David Fincher's new thriller "Panic Room," Jodie Foster and her
teenage daughter cower in a small fortress just off the bedroom of
her multi-story New York apartment, hidden from a trio of robbers
downstairs. Their elaborate dungeon is small, but it's equipped with
food, water, florescent lighting, fire blankets and a phone.</LD>
<LD>   Panic rooms like the one in the film can be found in new
homes--and home improvements--from mansions in Los Angeles to
brownstones in New York to flats in London, as well as other parts of
the world.</LD>
<LD>   Panic rooms have been installed in nearly every new home inside
the "privileged triangle" of Bel-Air, Beverly Park and Holmby Hills
(where the Playboy Mansion sits), according to Bill Rigdon, one of
the owners of Building Consensus, a local architectural, design,
engineering and security firm. Rigdon says some panic rooms are
minimalist annexes and some are luxurious hideaways, but every one
was conceived as an impenetrable barrier between a homeowner and an
armed intruder.</LD>
<TE>   In the film, which opens Friday, Foster and her daughter run to
the panic room for protection after a break-in. It's supposed to be
foolproof, but as Fincher notes, panic rooms are only as good as the
human in charge of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I stayed in an apartment in London in the early '90s, and it had
a panic room, and I proceeded to set the alarm off almost biweekly,"
he said. "So, I was instructed not to set the alarm, because I
couldn't be trusted not to set it off, defeating the entire purpose."</TE>
<TE>   And that's the catch. Panic rooms must be the homeowner's secret
passageway to safety. Architects do not tell contractors what they're
building, and homeowners--if they are serious about their
investment--refrain from making the panic room part of the tour
before a dinner party.</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, orders for panic rooms
have soared, according to Rigdon. "These people are scared," he said,
noting that he and his crew sign 10-page confidentiality agreements
with clients. "The people who were scared to begin with are even more
scared right now."</TE>
<TE>   Rigdon says his clients have paid between $50,000 to $500,000 for
a room that somehow speaks to their individual fears. He built one
room that was wired to a sensor affixed to a small, decorative
pendant around the homeowner's neck. Once the home's external
security system was breached, the door to the panic room would remain
on alert for the sensor to pass over its threshold. With the
sensor-wearing resident safely over the threshold, the heavy door
automatically pulled shut behind him or her. .</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best-known panic room expert is Gavin de Becker, who
has built thousands of high-tech havens since 1978 and who consulted
with Fincher for "Panic Room." In an e-mail from Fiji earlier this
month, De Becker said the confidentiality of panic rooms is so
critical that the owners usually tear them down when the house goes
on the market, so that neither real estate agents nor prospective
buyers see evidence of the owner's fears.</TE>
<TE>   That means, some experts say, catering to people who are less
concerned with thwarting a crime than with quelling their own
formidable anxieties. Nan Ellin, associate professor in the School of
Architecture in Arizona State University and author of "Architecture
of Fear" (1997), believes panic rooms are most appealing to parents.
"The most fearful demographics are young mothers. The second most
fearful demographics are young fathers," Ellin says. "So, put them
together with money and you've got a good formula for someone who
wants a saferoom."</TE>
<TE>   Others are more skeptical and dismiss the panic room phenomenon as
largely urban myth.</TE>
<TE>   Roger K. Lewis, a practicing architect in Washington, D.C., for 33
years, a professor of architecture at the University of Maryland and
author of "Shaping the City," a column in the Washington Post, has
never seen one.</TE>
<TE>   "I've designed a lot of houses, and I've never been asked to
include one in the designs," he said. "My impression is that the only
person who would build a so-called panic room is someone who is
paranoid."</TE>
<TE>   In the first scene of "Panic Room," Foster's character, Meg
Altman, appears tense and vulnerable. Altman is a woman of privilege
whose cheating husband has left her with no place to stash the
Bordeaux stemware. A real estate agent shows her a massive
townhouse-brownstone, (he calls it a "townstone,") with four floors,
several bedrooms, a functioning elevator and the panic room.</TE>
<TE>   "She's repelled by it," said the film's writer, David Koepp.
"She's on a tilt, with her marriage ending, and she overreacts. Why
did she choose such an unsuitable place for her? Panic, the clouded
judgment in panic."</TE>
<TE>   According to Fincher, who admits he lives in a gated community,
the movie is something of a personal parable from Koepp, whose
marriage was on the rocks when he wrote it.</TE>
<TE>   "The movie is a lot about divorce, the destruction of home, the
choices you make that lead you to standing in your home with all the
plaster dust and holes," Fincher said. "I had to give him little
pointers on how those conversations might be. He had written a lot of
people doing the best they can in a bad situation, and I had to
explain to him that sometimes people behave badly."</TE>
<TE>   As is typical for a Fincher film (he directed "Fight Club" and
"Seven"), "Panic Room" aims to make audiences uncomfortable. To play
up this creepy feeling, cinematographer Conrad W. Hall used cold,
sometimes greenish light as the movie progressed. It was not a
flattering method of lighting Academy Award winner Foster, but the
florescent hue effectively helped turn her from the hunted, jilted
wife into the strategic huntress.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, Foster said she knows no one with a panic room--she
doesn't even have a bodyguard, she said in a recent interview. But
Foster's personal security has been public fare since 1981, when,
during her sophomore year at Yale University, an obsessed fan named
John Hinckley Jr. opened fire on President Reagan outside the Hilton
Hotel in Washington. He later explained it was his way of proving his
love to the young actress. But now, Foster brushes aside a mention of
Hinckley, volunteering that she doesn't have a panic room or
bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel safe. I'm not a particularly paranoid person," she said,
calmly looking through her rectangle-framed glasses. "Burglars are a
little different than stalker assassins."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, she noted, "Panic Room" has less to do with safety than
with intimate relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "Metaphorically, it's about two kinds of couples who don't see one
another," she noted. "There's a big door between the two of them, and
each one of them comes with a total mistrust because of their
history," Foster said. "They start out kind of bumbling, but by the
end they're vicious because one person has to take the other one
down."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Foster is starring in the film at all is something
of a fluke; Nicole Kidman was supposed to play the role but had to
drop out because of a knee injury sustained during the making of
"Moulin Rouge." So Foster agreed to replace her.</TE>
<TE>   The film took six months to shoot, and when they wrapped, Foster
was entering the third trimester of her pregnancy (she had her second
son in September).</TE>
<TE>   "The last scene we shot of her is the first scene in the movie,
when she's looking at the house," Fincher said. "She's six months
pregnant, wearing a huge coat and carrying a 'Kelly bag,' which
coincidentally was designed to hide Grace Kelly's pregnancy. [The
purse] is held by both hands and perched right in front of her
stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Even that scene was a late addition. Koepp had originally wanted
to restrict Foster and the robbers (played by Dwight Yoakam, Jared
Leto and Forest Whitaker), to within the confines of the townhouse.
It was an economical and manageable filmmaking process that kept its
budget in the "low 40 millions," according to Koepp.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first draft, I never wanted to leave the house. Ever," he
said. "You're being buried alive in your own house."</TE>
<TE>   But that confinement became too claustrophobic, even for Fincher,
and for the final scene they let some of the characters out into the
daylight--into a city of millions that harbors an unknowable number
of panic rooms.</TE>

<LD>PHILADELPHIA--In 1967, young California artist Bruce Nauman made a
sculpture in the form of a neon sign. The sign's softly glowing blue
words follow a line of red light in an outward spiral path and
declare, "The true artist helps the world by revealing mystic
truths."</LD>
<LD>   Nauman's declaration could describe the philosophical basis for
the radically abstract paintings of New York School artist Barnett
Newman (1905-1970). Newman's often large expanses of oil or acrylic
color, carefully divided by variously brushed vertical lines, were
meant as a numinous utterance. He explained it at a prominent
symposium on "The Spiritual Dimension of Contemporary Art," held the
same year Nauman made his sign.</LD>
<LD>   "What matters to a true artist," Newman said in his typically
elliptical way, "is that he distinguish between a place and no place
at all; the greater the work of art, the greater will be this
feeling. And this feeling is the fundamental spiritual dimension."
(More on this later.)</LD>
<TE>   Nauman's neon sign hangs in the permanent collection of the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. In galleries nearby, the museum on Sunday
opened "Barnett Newman," the first full survey of the late painter's
work to be held since the posthumous retrospective at New York's
Museum of Modern Art in 1970. The serendipitous juxtaposition by
these two similarly named artists is telling.</TE>
<TE>   Nauman illuminates--literally--a fundamental tenet of Newman's.
Although Newman had only five solo exhibitions at commercial
galleries during his lifetime, he and his fellow New York School
artists had become the national (and international) standard-bearers.
Four Newman shows were in New York; one was in L.A.--in 1965 at
Nicholas Wilder Gallery, where Nauman also began to show the
following year. The artists shared a common concern, during a decade
of enormous upheaval in art and society, for fathoming the
appropriate role of "the true artist."</TE>
<TE>   But they're also separated by a smirk--by the wry possibility that
your leg is being pulled. Nauman's neon sign is ambiguous in a way
Newman's paintings never are. Its written statement seems sincere;
yes, the puzzle of the human spirit is indeed the territory of
serious art. But the vulgar form it takes here--commercial neon
sign--seems sarcastic. The piece looks like a crass invitation to
enter a palm reader's shop.</TE>
<TE>   Spiritual profundity? Or hocus pocus? That, in a nutshell,
describes the long-term argument over Modern art in general--and
Newman in particular.</TE>
<TE>   Newman was famously insistent on the mystical dimension embodied
in his visually spare but acutely rendered paintings. He titled them
with big names: "Onement," "Prometheus Bound," "Day Before One" and
"Vir Heroicus Sublimis" (Man, Heroic and Sublime). Or he used
biblical and mythological personages, such as "Joshua," "Abraham,"
"Achilles" and "Uriel" (the Judeo-Christian archangel of light). For
six years he worked on a cycle of 14 canvases he called "The Stations
of the Cross"; the 14th is all-white, except for a vertical strip of
raw canvas along the left edge.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors dismissed him as a pompous charlatan. Some of those
were writers, like the notoriously ill-informed critic for the New
York Times, John Canaday. Others were peers, like the great abstract
painter Ad Reinhardt, with whom Newman publicly feuded.</TE>
<TE>   But he had his fierce champions, too, including the influential
critic Clement Greenberg--who arrived late to Newman's side but once
there was adamant. Artists who were committed to his vision ranged
from Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko to a younger generation of
Minimalist artists, notably Frank Stella, Robert Mangold and Donald
Judd.</TE>
<TE>   Those battles seem like ancient history now. In this absorbing
show, which will be seen only in Philadelphia before moving in
September to London's Tate Modern, we encounter instead a Modernist
Old Master.</TE>
<TE>   As an abstract painter for whom color was critical, he assumes a
welcome relevance for the new color abstraction that is emerging
among so many young artists today. His savvy exploitation of color's
irrational power offers lessons for any painter seeking escape from
the long-standing bonds of an art based in language. Newman's
spirituality might differ from most artists' aims now, but never is
he trivial.</TE>
<TE>   Newman's art is phenomenological. Perceptual experience is its
key. Rational analysis can be applied to the ways in which his
materials are structured, but it's never enough to explain the
discovery of content within. Newman, whose politics were anarchist,
made art that rebelled against established order in painting. He made
art whose simplicity is calculated to deceive, then astound.</TE>
<TE>   "Onement I" (1948), the painting Newman considered his
breakthrough, is a modest easel picture just 27 inches high and 16
inches wide. It couldn't appear more artless. The surface is painted
the red-brown color of dried blood, in softly brushed vertical
strokes. Visually dense, it doesn't create an illusion of scenic
space.</TE>
<TE>   The canvas is split down the middle, top to bottom, by masking
tape, onto which Newman laid an irregular stripe of paint in flaming
cadmium red. The painted stripe--or zip, as he later came to call his
signature motif--was troweled on with a palette knife. Ragged and
smeary, it assumes a tangible presence that, through color, is both
part of and separate from the field on which it is marked.</TE>
<TE>   Newman likened the maneuver to the Book of Genesis, where creation
is an act of division: night from day, earth from water, light from
dark. As with a Mondrian or Malevich, if by wholly different means,
the effect is uncanny yet wholly matter-of-fact.</TE>
<TE>   Newman's best paintings are always matter-of-fact. That doesn't
mean they aren't complex.</TE>
<TE>   Standing before this otherwise unassuming canvas, whose vertical
orientation echoes your own stance before it, you see a handmade
object that illustrates nothing. Everything about it turns you back
on yourself; slowly you become aware of a perceptual unfolding
through time. The painting seems at once emphatically separate but
deeply connected to you.</TE>
<TE>   "Vir Heroicus Sublimis" (1950-51) is nearly 18 feet wide and
almost 8 feet high. The shifts in perceptual scale of the little
"Onement I" are enlarged accordingly. The big painting includes five
zips in different colors, although their placement starts to throw
the count into question. For instance, a creamy yellow-white zip a
few inches in from the right edge of the wide, luminous red canvas
leaves a red line along that edge. Does that red edge count as a
sixth zip?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, just how wide is a zip? Can't the broad red fields
between the skinny zips be perceived as stripes--really wide ones?
Their scale relative to the narrow zips suggests the painting was cut
from a gargantuan field of color that would dwarf this otherwise
monumental canvas. Adding up the fat and skinny zips, there are 11
rather than five, and three instead of one on "Onement I."</TE>
<TE>   The riddles in a Newman painting create a paradox. They conspire
to clarify your conscious awareness.</TE>
<TE>   As art historian Richard Schiff puts it in one of the catalog's
two excellent essays (the other is by the show's deft curator, Ann
Temkin), becoming aware of sensations in lived time creates for the
viewer "a place where the self could be recognized." Your entire
being--body and soul, not just eyes--is refreshed and vivified.</TE>
<TE>   There's something profoundly American in all this. It represents a
deep desire to start over from a new beginning.</TE>
<TE>   The American myth is historically of a place of new beginnings.
Newman's parents were impoverished Russian immigrants. His father
built a prosperous business but lost it in the Great Depression.
World War II, the Holocaust, the atomic bomb--an urge to start anew
was understandably intense among artists who lived through all that.</TE>
<TE>   Reason had failed--big time. The irrational was courted for new
ideas. Newman's early crayon drawings are abstract, but they suggest
strange life forms taking shape in an amorphous space. They
illustrate what "Onement I" would soon come to physically embody,
riding on the unruly power of color.</TE>
<TE>   Newman worked slowly. He didn't start until he was 40, and he was
not prolific. About half his 120 or so paintings are in the show.</TE>
<TE>   Some important works are missing (large paintings with fragile
surfaces are difficult to lend). The great "Who's Afraid of Red,
Yellow and Blue I" (1966) is incongruously shown in a wood frame,
which transforms it from a radical painted object into an old-time
picture. The catalog analyzes Newman's relationship to New York
Minimalism, yet ignores acute connections to L.A.'s Nauman, Robert
Irwin and others.</TE>
<TE>   But these are small complaints. Enough is here to make the show
satisfying. And even if you think Newman didn't get what he was
after, the ambition to aim high stands out starkly amid the puny
desires found in too much art today.</TE>

<LD>Pop quiz: Name the only producer in recent memory to preside over the
three top-rated hours in prime time.</LD>
<LD>   If you didn't immediately come up with Michael Davies, you
doubtless have plenty of company. Still, it was Davies, as executive
producer of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," who for a brief time
towered over the television industry as his quiz-show juggernaut
piled up revenue for ABC and programming casualties among its
competitors.</LD>
<LD>   In that respect, "Millionaire" became a kind of drug, juicing
ABC's ratings while tempting the network to keep inhaling more of it.
Yet when ABC increased the dosage from those three top-rated hours to
four editions per week, the high wore off rapidly, leaving the
network nursing a major-league hangover.</LD>
<TE>   So it is that a mere 21/2 years after the phrase "Is that your
final answer?" became 1999's version of "Where's the beef?" or "Go
ahead, make my day," "Millionaire" has become a scapegoat--its very
title indicative of the greed that propelled the media through the
1990s and the wake-up call that followed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a learning experience for me to go from having the
biggest hit on television to almost the biggest villain on
television," said the British-born Davies, who only recently turned
36 and acknowledges that "Millionaire" has pretty well set him up for
life. "I don't think I'll ever be naive again when I'm sitting upon a
hit to even think for a second that it's going to last."</TE>
<TE>   The real question now is what Davies and the show can do for an
encore as well as what lessons can be derived from the experience,
which exemplifies an age in which this season's sensation becomes
next year's has-been faster than you can say "Temptation Island" or
"Richard Hatch."</TE>
<TE>   Although "Millionaire's" parabolic rise and descent have made
ABC's ratings graph resemble a snake swallowing a warthog, the show
itself could be here long after Davies is ready to retire. A weekday
version of the series, a la "Jeopardy!," premieres on local TV
stations in September. In August, ABC will relaunch the network
incarnation in an enhanced form--including multiple millions in prize
money--by running it daily for two weeks, emulating the manner in
which it was introduced to U.S. audiences in August 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Davies has produced 365 episodes of "Millionaire,"
more than twice as many as "ER" has generated in eight seasons. For
that reason, the producer maintains that "Millionaire's" Icarus-like
flight can't be viewed in the same context as dramatic series and
disputes the assertion that ABC strip-mined the franchise through
overexposure.</TE>
<TE>   "Shows have a very natural life span," he said. "I think
'Millionaire' had a lifetime, and I'm not sure that had to do with
the number of episodes that were made. It had to do with the time
that something could be new. As soon as something isn't new anymore,
it goes very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "I cannot sit here and criticize ABC and say,
'They shouldn't have done more episodes,' because if I really felt
that strongly, I wouldn't have taken the money."</TE>
<TE>   Davies, in fact, always wanted to see "Millionaire" used as a
quarterly event, trotted out during sweeps periods to keep the
concept special. Still, viewers consumed the show so hungrily that
ABC couldn't resist feeding that appetite or the hundreds of millions
in profits that went with it.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, with its ratings having shrunk to a fraction of their
gaudy heights at its peak, "Millionaire" remains profitable, largely
because each hour costs about $400,000 to produce, excluding prize
money, less than a quarter of the price of the average prime-time
drama.</TE>
<TE>   "Millionaire" and CBS' "Survivor" have been the standard-bearers
for what have come to be known as "alternative series," a catchall
for anything that doesn't neatly fall under the headings of comedy,
drama or news. Still, if audiences embraced these concepts beyond
anyone's expectations, they have abandoned many of these novelties
just as quickly, prompting Davies to characterize the challenge as
"how you can give these things more staying power."</TE>
<TE>   A corresponding question is whether alternative series will become
increasingly outlandish and titillating to galvanize viewers.
Certainly, the networks seem to think so, given their reliance on
such car-crash confections as NBC's "Fear Factor" or Fox's "Celebrity
Boxing."</TE>
<TE>   "If I bought that assumption, what I'd have to buy into is the
idea that alternative programs can't be done with the same quality as
network dramas and comedies, and I'd also have to buy into the fact
that audiences essentially will accept the lowest common
denominator," Davies said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the Top 10 shows in America, more than any other
country in the world, people will watch quality: 'The West Wing.'
'Friends.' These are the best-written shows.... Of course, there are
exceptions, but even 'Fear Factor' is beautifully produced. People
want programs that are competently made."</TE>
<TE>   Davies, who lives in New York but flits back and forth between
London and Los Angeles, wants to establish himself as "the de facto
gatekeeper" for British television in the U.S. Through his company,
Diplomatic, he hopes to draw on the wealth of nonfiction
entertainment produced overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Davies contends that the next generation of alternative hits will
be less about bug-swallowing than taking ordinary people through a
progression in their actual lives, as opposed to the manipulated
environments created by shows like "Survivor" and "Big Brother."</TE>
<TE>   As for the prevailing sense that the more bizarre concepts on
display are inexorably leading toward the modern-day equivalent of
the Roman Colosseum, Davies said, "I'd never do 'Celebrity Boxing.'
I'd never do 'Fear Factor.' I'm not saying they don't have a place on
television. They do. But I couldn't feel very good about doing it....
I sleep very well at night. I don't think of myself as a scuzzy
'reality television' producer."</TE>
<TE>   All told, Davies has emerged from his brush with the record books
feeling no worse for wear. Having dreamed of being a sports writer
covering soccer before he graduated from college and moved to the
U.S., he has the freedom and wherewithal to pursue passions that
range from consulting on ABC's World Cup soccer coverage to
developing a soccer-themed movie with his brother William, a
Cambridge-educated writer whose resume incongruously includes the
broad comedies "Twins" and "Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."</TE>
<TE>   Though Davies stresses that he has no desire to dwell on the past,
he's well aware that in an industry hardly renowned for its memory,
it's worth savoring the perch he occupied in 2000, when all of
television had to look up to find him.</TE>
<TE>   "In all likelihood, I will never be around another show as big as
'Millionaire,'" he said. "I know that very well.... But you know
what? I enjoyed it."</TE>

<LD>In a decision heard around the world, Academy Award voters selected
"A Beautiful Mind" as best picture, effectively squelching an
apparent smear campaign that accused the filmmakers of omitting
potentially embarrassing details about John Forbes Nash Jr., the
real-life mathematical genius on whom the haunting biographical drama
is based.</LD>
<LD>   Some Oscar voters interviewed this week said that while there is
no way to determine how damaged "A Beautiful Mind" was by the
negative publicity (the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
keeps the tally a secret) they believe that voters ultimately decided
to go with what was on the screen and not off.</LD>
<LD>   "My guess is that most people in the academy felt that the award
should be about the finished work," said producer Tom Pollock, an
academy voter and onetime studio chief at Universal Pictures.</LD>
<TE>   "The voters make up their own minds," said academy voter Paul
Mazursky, a director whose credits include "Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp;
Alice" (1969), "Harry and Tonto" (1974) and the 1998 HBO movie
"Winchell."</TE>
<TE>   Mazursky said he paid no attention to the smears being hurled at
"A Beautiful Mind," but he admitted that the resulting controversy
impelled him to seek out author Sylvia Nasar's biography of the same
name on which the movie was based.</TE>
<TE>   "I did some investigating about the life of Nash," Mazursky said.
"People who read the book said [the filmmakers] did play around with
the facts a little, but I still like the movie. It's a movie, not the
gold standard."</TE>
<TE>   Although the whisper campaign about "A Beautiful Mind" fizzled as
quickly as it took Tom Hanks to unseal the envelope from
PricewaterhouseCoopers and announce the winner, Oscar voters and
observers of the Academy Awards are worried that the lowbrow
political tactics used to sully the picture may have crossed an Oscar
Rubicon with potentially dire consequences for the process itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certain the vote was a lot closer when it was finally taken
than it would have been three months ago before the controversy,"
said Hollywood historian Neal Gabler.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago, Gabler said, many thought "A Beautiful Mind"
could have won in a walk and the film's star, Russell Crowe, would
win best actor as well. As it turned out, Denzel Washington won for
best actor for "Training Day."</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most political of Oscars, both in terms of industry
politics and external politics," Gabler said. "I can't remember an
Oscars--maybe 'Coming Home' and 'The Deer Hunter' going back to
1978--that was so political. I mean, Julia Roberts, in an interview
with Newsweek, was already injecting race into the Oscar race when
she said Denzel Washington had to win and if he didn't win it would
be awful. It was a peculiar type of nimbus around this Oscars."</TE>
<TE>   Despite allegations that filmmakers had omitted from the
screenplay that Nash allegedly had homosexual encounters and had
uttered anti-Semitic remarks during the years he struggled to
overcome schizophrenia, "A Beautiful Mind" basked in a cluster of top
honors in Sunday night's ceremony. Besides best picture and director
(Ron Howard), academy voters named Jennifer Connelly best supporting
actress and honored Akiva Goldsman for his adapted screenplay. Only
Crowe, the brooding and talented New Zealand-born actor, failed to
win, and some believed he shot himself in the foot because of reports
of boorish behavior in the waning days of the Oscar race.</TE>
<TE>   Director Mazursky said that for a smear campaign to work, it
assumes that the Oscar voters would have seen the film and come away
undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "I just vote for what I think should win," he said, noting that he
even avoids reading the massive number of Oscar campaign ads that
studios run in Hollywood's major trade publications, Variety and the
Hollywood Reporter, to tout their Oscar nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Mazursky doubts those ads have much influence on Oscar voters and
noted that when Art Carney won the Oscar for best actor in "Harry and
Tonto," the studios did little in the way of campaigning for him.
Carney won over stiff competition from Dustin Hoffman in "Lenny,"
Jack Nicholson in "Chinatown," Al Pacino in "The Godfather, Part II"
and Albert Finney in "Murder on the Orient Express."</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar vote, Mazursky said, "is more honest than people think.
If there was any lack of honesty, studios would ask their people to
vote for their picture. I don't think that happens very much. I
really don't."</TE>
<TE>   Director Mark Rydell ("On Golden Pond") said as an Oscar voter he
disregarded the attacks on "A Beautiful Mind" because he was
convinced that schizophrenic Nash's purported anti-Semitic remarks
came "when he was completely out of his head."</TE>
<TE>   Rydell said he thought the alleged whisper campaign against the
movie, involving leaks to the press about events in Nash's life that
weren't in the film, was just "a lot of smoke. I find it hard to
believe, and I prefer not to believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he stressed, Howard and his filmmaking team had not set
out to make a documentary of Nash, but a feature film. "I thought it
was one of the most insightful exhibitions of schizophrenia ever
made," Rydell said. "It asked what is it like to be deluded like
that. You weren't just told it, you saw it."</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Kenny, senior editor at Premiere magazine, called the
whisper campaign "grotesque and lamentable" but ultimately
ineffectual.</TE>
<TE>   "It caused nothing but a lot of hostility toward the people who
were perceived to be instigating it," Kenny said.</TE>
<TE>   One question hovering over the "Beautiful Mind" Oscar campaign was
whether best actor nominee Crowe's chances were hurt by the
accusations against Nash. While many praised Crowe's on-screen
performance, it was his off-screen behavior that may have tipped the
scales to winner Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Gabler believes Crowe's chances were hurt by a combination of
factors that included a recent public incident at the British film
awards in which the actor angrily confronted the show's producer and
berated him for having deleted from the telecast some of Crowe's
comments in his acceptance speech. Gabler felt Crowe also was hurt by
the Nash controversy and the racial factor.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a statement being made in Denzel Washington being voted
over Crowe," Gabler said. "One of the interesting things about the
broadcast is that in the guise of being forward-thinking about race,
it actually turned out to be backward-thinking about race, because
the great to-do made about the fact that two African American actors
[Washington and Halle Berry] won best actor and actress only shows
you how little we had advanced--and it was not that far."</TE>
<TE>   Crowe has garnered a bad-boy reputation as a macho ladies' man who
breaks hearts as easily as he memorizes dialogue. His messy affair
with actress Meg Ryan was just one example.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the only thing that was clearly evident [in the academy
vote] was the real antipathy toward Russell Crowe," said
entertainment attorney Eric Weissmann, a nonvoting member of the
academy. "When you consider the fact that Jennifer Connelly won--and
I don't mean to denigrate her role, but she just played his wife--and
that she would get it and the picture and director would get it, but
the main actor on whom the entire movie rests gets nothing. That is a
very strong statement. I think people just turned away from him."</TE>
<TE>   Added Rydell: "I think Russell Crowe did himself some harm by
behaving in a less than attractive fashion. But I also think Denzel
Washington deserved the award. He gave an absolutely stunning
performance."</TE>
<TE>   The debate over "A Beautiful Mind" will linger for years, many
believe, and could prove unsettling for Hollywood in the long run,
should filmmakers now shy away from making biopics for fear of being
placed in the media's interrogation chair.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, in the future, when people are thinking about using
biopics, they'll be more cautious on how they use the facts," Gabler
said. "I happen to think this is a tragedy. To think we have this new
chilling effect. That artists are going to have to be bound by facts.
... Imagine if Shakespeare was bound to the real character in
'Richard III'? If he were alive today, would Shakespeare be called
upon to revise that play?"</TE>

<HD>Inspired by 'Redeemer's' True Story</HD>

<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On my very first day as a newspaperman, an editor whose breath stank
of cheap cigars forever imprinted on me the profession's devotion to
factual accuracy.</LD>
<LD>   I'd been assigned to write obituaries. One of those I wrote that
day stated, in accord with the death notice from the funeral home,
that the deceased had lived at such-and-such address in such-and-such
town. "You sure that address is in the city limits?" the editor
snarled. He jerked his thumb toward a stack of local street
directories.</LD>
<LD>   To make a long story short, although the departed himself probably
claimed to be from the town, he went to his Maker a resident of the
outlying township, at least on our obit page--and we got it right.</LD>
<TE>   After three decades of such finickiness about fact, I had to make
quite a psychic leap to write a movie fictionalized from a real story
I'd covered. The movie, "Redeemer," premiered Tuesday on USA Network.</TE>
<TE>   "Redeemer," which stars Matthew Modine, Obba Babatunde and Michele
Greene, is my first screenplay. Writing it (and rewriting it and
rewriting it) was like sailing a small boat into deep waters. The
farther I got from the shore of fact, the uneasier I became.</TE>
<TE>   Recent movies such as "The Hurricane" and "A Beautiful Mind" have
been criticized for departing too readily from the real-life stories
they supposedly tell. "Redeemer" is in a somewhat different category
than some of them, designated as being "inspired by," as opposed to
"based on," a true story.</TE>
<TE>   Yet beneath its fiction beats the heart of fact. That quiet
throbbing never left my ears as I devised make-believe characters,
make-believe scenes and make-believe dialogue. Venturing into the
unfamiliar--a place where cavalier treatment of writers' work is
legendary--I probably had a psychic need for some semblance of the
control that adherence to fact gives a writer in the newspaper
business, where the most heinous sin an editor can commit is to
insert an inaccuracy into a reporter's story.</TE>
<TE>   Not to give the movie's plot away, but the real-life case involved
a prison inmate and the sister of a man who had died as a result of
the prisoner's crime.</TE>
<TE>   As a 19-year-old Black Panther, the inmate, Ahmad Rahman (the name
is changed in the film) had participated in raiding what he thought
was a drug den. He'd been sentenced to life without parole after one
of his accomplices, apparently accidentally, killed a young man in
the house.</TE>
<TE>   I learned of the inmate a decade and a half into his sentence. He
had metamorphosed from a reckless young revolutionary into a model
prisoner and learned man, a voice of civility and good sense to other
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote a long feature story about him for the newspaper I worked
for at the time. The article pointed out that his unusually harsh
sentence had resulted from his refusal to plea-bargain, and that his
accomplices--including the killer, who pleaded guilty to
second-degree murder--long since had been paroled.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, after becoming a newspaper columnist, I took up
the inmate's cause as an advocate. In a dozen columns over three
years, I called on the governor to reverse a long-standing practice
of denying commutation to even the most deserving inmates. By then,
the inmate had been in prison for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   After one of the first columns appeared, I received, from out of
the blue, a telephone call from the sister of the victim. The article
clearly had distressed her by recalling the most painful memories of
her life. She vowed to oppose any attempt to release the inmate.</TE>
<TE>   In "Redeemer," the crime committed, and the situation and
character of the inmate, played by Babatunde, are much the same as in
the real-life story. A lot more of the movie, however, varies greatly
from the facts of the actual events.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there is, and was from my first draft, no
newspaperman character. Even in my naivete, I sensed that burdening
the script with a character too much like myself would only hobble
whatever creativity I could muster in telling the story dramatically.
The reporter became instead a novelist, played by Modine, who
masquerades as a prison writing teacher in the hope of picking up
good material for a future book.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the inmate and the teacher starts cold
and becomes contentious. This is a far cry from my relationship with
the real-life inmate, which was always cordial.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's sister, played by Greene, also undergoes a
transformation. Instead of someone surprised and angered many years
later by an article on the death of her brother, she becomes a
vengeful, bitter woman, obsessed from Day 1 with making sure the
inmate never knows freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the movie, the Black Panther raid is a set-up,
arranged by a police informer. In my real-life articles, I cited
evidence pointing toward such a possibility but never was able to
confirm it. I tried to track down the likely candidate, but failed to
locate him.</TE>
<TE>   Many other gross deviations from fact lived for various lengths of
times as I wrote draft after draft. Mercifully discarded after a long
existence was a love affair between the novelist and the sister.
Various "issues" I tried to inflict on the novelist--first, a
drinking problem, then severe writer's block, then panic attacks--all
were marched, I am now delighted to report, to the guillotine.</TE>
<TE>   All of this was in the service of fattening the drama content to
the story for consumption by a movie audience. Journalistic truth
asks, "Is it factual?," but movie truth asks, "Is it interesting
enough?" In a movie, there is little tolerance for the languor and
periodic inactivity that characterize real life.</TE>
<TE>   The process of deviating from fact accelerated as more hands--the
producer, the director, the actors--came aboard my little boat,
altering and re-altering its heading, taking us farther from the
smell of land.</TE>
<TE>   I was very lucky that the executive producer, Robert Greenwald;
the director, Graeme Clifford; and the principal actors proved on the
whole remarkably collegial, even with so lowly a figure as the
writer. Nonetheless, mandates by the producer, ad-libs by the actors,
on-the-set brainstorms by the director all significantly affected the
shape and tone of "Redeemer."</TE>
<TE>   As I watched, sometimes fascinated, sometimes chagrined, by what
was happening to the writing that I, in my journalist's way, had so
meticulously fashioned, the director's assistant gave me perhaps the
most helpful insight into the process: "It was a screenplay," she
said cheerily, "but now it's becoming a movie."</TE>
<TE>   It was the real-life events that fired me with a desire to relate
the tale forcefully to a larger audience. Although doing so required
departing from the facts of those events, I like to think their
emotional power survives undiminished in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Consistent with a screenwriter's fate, however, even that will be
determined by others--namely, viewers who tuned in Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   James Ricci is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Magazine.</TE>

<HD>Next! New Comedies Step Up</HD>
<DH>ABC debuts 'The George Lopez Show,' 'Wednesday 9:30 (8:30
Central)'; Fox presents 'Greg the Bunny.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a massive military force in constant need of fresh troops at the
front lines, the networks are rotating in three new comedies tonight
in hopes of finding something audiences will salute.</LD>
<LD>   ABC welcomes a pair of promising recruits: "The George Lopez Show"
at 8:30 p.m. and an oddly titled sitcom whose creators evidently
wanted to eliminate any confusion as to its programming slot:
"Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)."</LD>
<LD>   The latter's naming ploy could be an ingenious preemptive strike
by the series to discourage the network from experimenting with
shifts to different days and times, an all-too-common industry
practice with new shows.</LD>
<TE>   The third arrival is Fox's "Greg the Bunny," another 9:30 p.m.
entry, whose late-ish time slot should signal that the content is not
quite the cuddly family entertainment that its title might suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Although all three deliver a generous ration of laughs, the
delightfully twisted "Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)" carries the day,
with "Greg" and then "George" following close behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Wednesday" follows the oddball goings-on at a fictional
television network, sort of a "Mary Tyler Moore Show" as filtered
through an "SCTV" lens.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Sergei ("Jack and Jill," "The Opposite of Sex") stars as
David Weiss, who is improbably plucked from the Minnesota theater
circuit to take over as head of new programming at IBS in Hollywood.
But Weiss' cheery Midwestern spirit and guileless nature are in for
culture shock of comic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   IBS is a company that thrives on power and paranoia, and with John
Cleese as station owner Red (yes, simply Red) and Ed Begley Jr. as
president Paul Weffler, the right inmates are running this asylum.</TE>
<TE>   The brilliant Cleese is on hand only for sporadic duty as the
charmingly ruthless kingpin, but he steals every scene he's in
without breaking a sweat. Begley, meanwhile, is a deadpan hoot as the
station ringmaster forever listening for Red's footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's episode, Weiss has scarcely settled into his new
office when he finds himself romantically entangled with real-life
actress Lori Loughlin ("Full House"), and part of a wager with a
senior VP (James McCauley), namely that the new guy can't go a week
without telling a lie.</TE>
<TE>   Before the episode is over, Weiss finds himself the target of a
sexual harassment lawsuit, $100 poorer--and beginning to feel right
at home at IBS.</TE>
<TE>   Two other station execs, Melinda McGraw as Lindsay Urich and
Sherri Shepherd-Tarpley as Joanne Walker, fill out the bill nicely.
The only real gripe is (sweetened?) live-audience laughter that
borders on the obtrusive and oversells writing that doesn't need it.</TE>
<TE>   "Wednesday's" new competition at 9:30, "Greg the Bunny," comes out
of the chute with a strong debut as well. The
kiddie-show-within-a-show's puppets-are-alive premise is an easy
sell, along the lines of a Muppets for mature audiences. Some of the
slapstickier moments may tempt you to wake the kids, but resist the
impulse.</TE>
<TE>   The always amusing Eugene Levy stars as producer-director Gil
Bender, who is having rabbit-related casting problems on his
children's series "Sweetknuckle Junction." Bender's ne'er-do-well son
Jimmy (Seth Green) and his bunny pal Greg have just the solution,
however.</TE>
<TE>   The show's ribald tendencies make for some entertaining moments,
but they can also nudge the show off course, as in the crudely
unfunny second episode that features pet neutering as the
centerpiece. But here's hoping for a return to form in the coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The George Lopez Show," meanwhile, has some spice of its own, but
basically it's an amiable sitcom about a family that--sit down if you
aren't already--happens to be Latino. This is turning out to be quite
a week for minority actors.</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Lopez stars as a recently promoted factory foreman now
supervising his former workmates, a transition that isn't always easy
but is often pretty funny. At home, wife Angie ("American Family's"
easy-on-the-eyes Constance Marie) helps George cope with his new job
while dealing with his formidably outspoken mother (Belita Moreno).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of eyes, the show's producers have reportedly tried to
stop Lopez from bulging his out while delivering his lines, but as
you'll see tonight, they haven't made much headway.</TE>
<TE>   But get beyond that if you can, because "The George Lopez Show" is
worth the effort.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The George Lopez Show" premieres tonight at 8:30 on ABC. The
network has rated it TV-PG-L (may be inappropriate for young
children, with an advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>New Group to Continue El Portal Programming</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Portal Center for the Arts--the nonprofit that leased North
Hollywood's El Portal Theatre--is insolvent because of debts that may
reach as high as $3 million, stemming from the organization's
conversion of the 1926 movie palace into a live performance center
during the last decade, according to former board members.</LD>
<LD>   But the organization's programming will continue under different
auspices.</LD>
<LD>   Stan Haberman, who was the last remaining board member of the
nonprofit until he resigned last week, is leading a group that will
independently finance and produce El Portal's 2002 mainstage season
under the banner of Shadow Box Productions, paying rent directly to
the building's owners. Shadow Box tickets will be printed and mailed
to the approximately 2,300 subscribers who bought the season last
year, Haberman said.</LD>
<TE>   The season will begin with the previously announced revival of a
1971 Kander and Ebb musical, "70, Girls, 70," starring Charlotte Rae,
Marni Nixon and Jane Kean, playing May 18-June 9. The other shows are
"Vamps," which was postponed in January because of the financial
crunch, "Nunsense" and "Ain't Misbehavin'."</TE>
<TE>   The building's two smaller theaters are already running shows from
independent producers that also rent directly from the building's
owners.</TE>
<TE>   David Houk, an L.A.-based theatrical entrepreneur who once owned
the Pasadena Playhouse complex, is considering taking over the lease
for the El Portal mainstage.</TE>

<HD>'Kurosawa' Shows His Life Was the Movies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When director Akira Kurosawa died in September 1998, at age 88, he
had long been widely regarded as the world's greatest living
filmmaker. As one of his colleagues remarks in Adam Low's
comprehensive and evocative "Kurosawa," which airs at 9 tonight on
KCET-TV, until his innovative 1950 film "Rashomon" won worldwide
acclaim, all the West knew about Japan was "earthquakes and kamikaze
suicide pilots."</LD>
<LD>   A period picture, "Rashomon" recounted a bandit's assault upon a
lady traveling through a forest, told from four points of view in a
dynamic, highly visual style. Its title, though it literally means
"By the Gate," has entered our lexicon as a word used to describe
different points of view of the same thing.</LD>
<LD>   Kurosawa was born in 1910 into an old samurai family, and his
father, a military man and later an instructor at a gymnastics
institution, was a strict, severe man. Yet Kurosawa would take the
rebellion of his older brother, who lived a bohemian lifestyle and
worked as a narrator of silent films, a step further by entering the
motion picture industry in 1936 as an assistant director. He soon
supplemented his meager income by writing scripts.</LD>
<TE>   Kurosawa, who had first studied to be a Western-style painter, got
a chance to direct with "Sanshiro Sugata" (1943), a surprisingly
mature work about a young judo master seeking enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   Low has the usual resources of the documentarian of a famous
filmmaker at hand: clips from the director's films, reminiscences
from colleagues and family and various archival materials, including
substantial illuminating interview footage of Kurosawa. He assembles
them in a graceful, evocative manner that captures much of the
essence of Kurosawa's character and personality, his time and place
and his enduring impact on filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Kurosawa was a proud, determined and disciplined artist who could
carry perfectionism to extremes. He suggested looking into his
characters to discover what he was like. And of those characters he
said, they "try to live honestly and make the most of their lot in
life. I believe you must live honestly and develop your abilities to
the full."</TE>
<TE>   Low wisely doesn't attempt to assess Kurosawa's more than 30 films
in his two-hour documentary but deals with the most significant, such
as "Seven Samurai" (1954), an epic saga of a group of wandering
samurai who bond with the villagers who have hired them to protect
them from bandit attacks; "Yojimbo" (1961), about the adventures of a
scruffy samurai for hire, an unsentimental, sometimes dryly comical
free spirit; and "Red Beard" (1965), a saga of a pioneering 19th
century physician that took two years to make.</TE>
<TE>   The star of these films, who also played the bandit in "Rashomon"
and appeared in about half the films Kurosawa made, was Toshiro
Mifune, who exuded star charisma. He was also a superb actor,
versatile, expressive yet quick and economical in ways that amazed
the director.</TE>
<TE>   Winner of a "New Faces" competition held by Toho Studios just
after World War II, Mifune was untrained as an actor but quickly
caught Kurosawa's attention. They soon began one of world cinema's
greatest actor-director collaborations, but it came to an untimely
and bitter end when Mifune got tired of the seemingly interminable
shooting schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Mifune would do many more films but few worthy of his talent
before his death in 1997, and Kurosawa would be faced with his
aborted involvement with "Tora! Tora! Tora!", about the attack on
Pearl Harbor, and the disappointment of "Dodes'ka-den," a 1970
Neo-Realist-style drama of shantytown life that would lead to a
suicide attempt in September 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with the backing of Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas and
the involvement of 20th Century Fox, Kurosawa came back strong with
his large-scale feudal-era battle epic "Kagemusha" (1976) and "Ran"
(1985), a glorious reworking of "Macbeth."</TE>
<TE>   His daughter remarks that, to the end, Kurosawa maintained his
passionate interest in films, looking at videos of both his own
pictures and those of others.</TE>
<TE>   "Take 'myself,'" Kurosawa once said, "subtract movies, and the
result is zero."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Kurosawa" can be seen on PBS' "Great Performances" at 9 tonight
on KCET-TV.</TE>

<HD>'Grounded,' but How Much Life?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the series debuted two years ago, "Grounded for Life" sounded
like a cute title for a Fox sitcom chronicling the exploits of one
kooky clan, the Finnerty family.</LD>
<LD>   But with this season's ratings wobbly at best and possible
replacements warming up in the bullpen, the title at this stage might
be considered downright prophetic.</LD>
<LD>   Fans are already circling the wagons, forming save-the-show
factions and trying to get word out to the uninitiated about giving
the show a chance. Tonight at 8:30 you can judge its merits for
yourself in the new episode "Relax."</LD>
<TE>   The show's usual flashback construction, sort of a "Memento" for
the sitcom set, follows the Finnertys on a family outing to an
amusement park that, unbeknownst to them, is holding a gay pride day.
Sean (Donal Logue), who has temporarily lost track of his wife and
kids, runs into a co-worker who's there to celebrate the park's
promotion--and greets Sean with a warm hug when he assumes that Sean
is doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   Sean, of course, had no idea of the man's sexual orientation, and
now he's worried how the rest of their blue-collar buddies at work
might react if word gets out. And word does get out.</TE>
<TE>   It's the type of TV plot that might have seemed a daring venture
30 years ago, but the episode moves blithely forward anyway, mining
Sean's rattled nerves for all they're worth.</TE>
<TE>   The show's funniest moments actually involve Lynsey Bartilson as
daughter Lily, and her ongoing battle to stop the world at large from
stealing her boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "Grounded for Life" is still a work in progress at becoming a
series truly worth saving.</TE>

<HD>ABC's Win Is Tarnished</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Academy Awards provided ABC with only its second weeklong ratings
win of the season, but the network still saw some rain fall on its
victory parade, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   The overall audience for the Oscar telecast was the lowest since
1997 (before the show moved to Sunday night and an earlier start
time), and viewing of ABC's arrival show and Barbara Walters
interview special fell by 10% and 5%, respectively, versus last year.</LD>
<LD>   It's also worth noting that the percentage of U.S. homes tuning in
declined to a record low, with slightly more than a quarter of U.S.
households watching the awards at any given moment--a trend offset in
part by population growth. The fact that Sunday's show was the
longest Oscars on record didn't do much to benefit the ratings. The
estimated audience, by the way, doesn't factor in the last 12
minutes, since Nielsen stopped measuring the show after the final
commercial break, which is all advertisers care about.</LD>
<TE>   Turning to another spring ritual, CBS' NCAA men's basketball
tournament coverage continues to slightly outpace results from a year
ago. Two new sitcoms, meanwhile, got off to promising starts last
week, with CBS' "Baby Bob" faring well behind "The King of Queens"
and Fox's "Andy Richter Controls the Universe" beating NBC's fading
Julia Louis-Dreyfus vehicle "Watching Ellie" in its slot.</TE>

<LD>"Do you want me to chew your food for you?" booms Julian Schnabel
when a reporter asks him to walk around the Gagosian Gallery and talk
about the five works in his new show, "Big Girl Paintings."</LD>
<LD>   Well, er, no.</LD>
<LD>   During an interview on a recent afternoon at the Beverly Hills
gallery, Schnabel gestures animatedly, invites a homeless man in to
talk about the art, and has a viewer try on two different pairs of
shades to look at the color of the paintings.</LD>
<TE>   It's easy to get the sense that Schnabel is playing around as he
waits for the crowd to arrive for the show's opening.</TE>
<TE>   And then he starts talking.</TE>
<TE>   Between statements such as "I just like to [mess] around with
paint," and "It's just a girl," Schnabel gets serious..</TE>
<TE>   The girls have no eyes, just a sweep of paint across their faces,
and that absence negates any relationship, says the artist, who bases
the work on a small, kitschy painting he found in 1987. Once you look
at the eyes, it's too late, he explains. You have begun a
relationship with the paintings and their subjects.</TE>
<TE>   It takes Schnabel a day to create one of the paintings using his
hands and a spatula.</TE>
<TE>   The results, which measure about 108 by 102 inches, fetch several
hundred thousand dollars each--and this show was sold out before the
opening.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Girls attract a crowd, and by 8 p.m., the reception is
more akin to a Hollywood premiere, with Dennis Hopper, Dustin
Hoffman, John Waters, Elton John, Benicio Del Toro, Gwyneth Paltrow,
Matt Dillon, Marisa Tomei and David Lynch among the many guests in
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crazy," Schnabel observes to no one in particular, "and I
don't even know half the people inside."</TE>
<TE>   Mideast Violence Through Young Eyes</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, the buzz inside the Beverly Hills movie theater
Friday--two days before the Academy Awards--had nothing to do with
Oscars. The conversations, spoken mostly in Hebrew and Arabic,
centered on the heartbreaking elusiveness of peace in the Middle
East. The stars of the evening were three teenagers: twin Israelis,
Yarko and Daniel, 16, and Sanabel, 15, an Arab who lives in the
Deheishe Palestinian refugee camp outside Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   As three of the seven Israeli and Palestinian children featured in
the Oscar-nominated documentary "Promises," the teens were eager to
travel to the United States to share their views on the violence in
their world, and the film's nomination brought them to L.A. (Concern
for the teen's safety in this time of heightened conflict led
filmmakers to withhold their last names.)</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, the crowd at the Laemmle Music Hall Theatre on
Wilshire Boulevard had just viewed the film, which features the teens
at their homes in and around Jerusalem from 1997 to 2000. Through
interviews and meetings among the children, the filmmakers address
the political and religious differences that divide them. The Music
Hall audience had a lot of questions for the film's articulate stars.
("Somehow, being together and being the center of attention has
forced them to think very keenly about [their opinions]," said the
film's co-director, co-writer and co-producer, B.Z. Goldberg.)</TE>
<TE>   One woman in the audience asked Yarko whether he believed God or
fate had a hand in his meeting the Palestinian children. "It's not
from God," the teen replied through an interpreter. "It's from
people.... If the politicians can't do what they promise to do, then
it's up to the people on either side to put an end to the violence."</TE>
<TE>   Another audience member asked how their political views had
changed from 2000, a time of relative peace compared with today's
intense violence.</TE>
<TE>   Sanabel, now 15, said the recent conflict has left her feeling
alone and isolated. But the teens take pride in the film and its
message. Speaking through a translator on Friday, Sanabel is quick to
emphasize the true purpose of her visit: to communicate the plight of
the Palestinians. Touching her heart she says: "This is, for me, a
huge responsibility."</TE>

<LD>My friend Paul made a good point the other day, how he hadn't seen
any of the movies nominated for Oscars and had no real desire to see
them either, a sad state for the world of movies and the world of
men.</LD>
<LD>   "Paul made a good point," I tell my wife later.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a first," she says.</LD>
<TE>   I tell her what Paul said about movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Good point," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "See?" I say, then I tell her how I think U2 is a good band but
sort of overrated, that I don't understand the big fuss. I even
bought one of the band's CDs recently, enjoyed it well enough but
still think the band receives too much praise.</TE>
<TE>   "You're right," she says.</TE>
<TE>   So naturally, I'm feeling pretty good. My wife and I have agreed
twice on things, which hasn't happened since our third date.</TE>
<TE>   I watch her make a list on the little chalkboard on the
refrigerator, our schedule for the day--when the little girl is
singing at the spring fair, when baseball practice is, that sort of
thing. A typical Saturday in America. No timeouts. No downtime.
Remember downtime? Me neither.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you sit there humming Beatles songs," my wife asks, "but
you won't take me to see Paul McCartney?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take you," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "Really?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'll drop you off in front, then I'll pick you up when it's
over," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Just don't talk to strangers," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   There's a pause while she decides whether to kill me or make
coffee.</TE>
<TE>   As always, she's pressed for time. They're expecting her at the
school fair in 15 minutes, hardly enough time for murder.</TE>
<TE>   "You have no idea how hard it is to be married to you," she
finally says.</TE>
<TE>   "Marriage," I tell her, "is stranger than fiction."</TE>
<TE>   In my defense, mostly bad stuff happens to us at concerts. Once, I
lost the car.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was that Hollywood Bowl concert when our friend Debbie
ended up upside down in the back of the minivan, her Mary Janes
scraping the ceiling as she searched for the corkscrew or Chapstick
or whatever it was she was searching for. Our lost youth, probably.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Clapton concert at Staples, where--like Mick
Jagger--I was spotted with the wife of a close friend. She had paused
to say hello to some folks while our respective spouses continued on
to our seats, leaving me with the wife of the close friend only
momentarily, but long enough for people to spot us standing together
at the Clapton concert. It created a 30-second scandal in our little
suburb in the hills.</TE>
<TE>   "Marriage," I tell my wife again, "is stranger than fiction."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to the fair," she says.</TE>
<TE>   All you young wives out there, here's marriage tip No. 312: Allow
him his jokes.</TE>
<TE>   When a spouse begins to riff a little, the loving thing to do is
to stick around and feed him straight lines so he can continue his
riff. For a riff is nothing to be sneered at. Not in this town.</TE>
<TE>   My friend Pete riffs for a couple of hours, then they make a movie
about it. My buddy Bill, a "Seinfeld" alum, teaches riffing in an
improv class. My buddy Brian? The guy even walks funny. Seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Los Angeles has its share of problems. It's hard to find a
decent sandwich. The bars have no atmosphere. The women, some of them
come with foreign parts.</TE>
<TE>   The flip side is that there are lots of funny people to hang out
with. My buddy Bill and I can riff for hours. Some of them we even
plan in advance, so committed are we to the perfect gag.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's what we do," I tell him after a recent softball game.
"Next time the other coach starts citing the rulebook, I'm going to
throw my arms in the air and go, 'You mean there's a rulebook?' Then
I'll yell over to you, 'HEY, BILL, DID YOU KNOW THERE'S A RULEBOOK?'"</TE>
<TE>   "We can riff on that for three innings," Bill says excitedly.</TE>
<TE>   "We can riff on that our whole lives," I say.</TE>
<TE>   And with that, I know it's going to be a great season.</TE>
<TE>   It's late Saturday and the riffing is over. My wife is off
counting the money from the spring fair. The little girl won a
stuffed bear, taller than her mother.</TE>
<TE>   I'm home helping the boy prepare for the spring dance. He's tied a
necktie once or twice in his life. I've tied a necktie 4 million
times. Between the two of us, we can probably figure this one out.</TE>
<TE>   The boy snakes his new tie around his neck, then yanks it hard, as
if securing a dirigible to a tent stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Looser," I say. "In case you have to breathe."</TE>
<TE>   "Can you do it?" he gasps.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, here," I say, then stand behind him facing the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   It's always amazing how a Saturday can start off all pure and full
of promise and then spiral out of control, then bounce back and give
you some little nugget of hope. The boy in his new suit is my nugget
of hope. On the third try, we get his tie almost even.</TE>
<TE>   "You look sharp," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks a little crooked," the boy says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just your head," I say. "Family trait."</TE>
<TE>   The boy stands in front of the mirror. He admires his new suit. I
admire him.</TE>
<TE>   The cycle continues. Despite all evidence to the contrary, young
people today continue to believe in the sanctity of something.
Despite their harsh music and mean movies, today's teenagers are
really romantics at heart. The species depends on it.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing's perfect. Love is strange. Marriage is stranger. Stranger
than fiction. All we can do is keep trying. And hope the next
generation does it better.</TE>
<TE>   "Here," I say. "Let's try that tie again."</TE>

<LD>"I need to keep a journal in my car," a friend of mine laments. "I
have all these great ideas and the minute the engine's off, they're
gone."</LD>
<LD>   I know exactly what he means. I have written novels in the car,
songs and sonnets and Oscar-winning screenplays. Driving the streets
of L.A., I have solved the dysfunctions of all my friends and their
families, come up with the best theme for a kid's birthday party
ever, pinpointed the fatal flaw in the Al Gore campaign, solved
global warming and figured out how to entertain eight unexpected
dinner guests, including three vegans and a lactose intolerant,
without resorting to takeout.</LD>
<LD>   Then I take the key out of the ignition and presto-change-o, I'm
back at my permanent residence--1313 Wit's End.</LD>
<TE>   I suspect it has something to do with the laws of inertia. A body
in motion will stay in motion until acted upon by a force greater
than itself and I suppose the same is true of a brain. No one has
ever bothered to explain to me the neurological relationship between
my brain and my brake pads, but it is a deep and abiding one. Perhaps
it has more to do with the nature of imagination, which one always
envisions as an active sort of creature, always taking flight or
running away with one.</TE>
<TE>   So if you put one moving body (the imagination) in another moving
body (the car) the whole process goes into double time.</TE>
<TE>   Like a child running on a moving sidewalk, you feel the euphoria
of accelerated possibility, of existence outside the constraints of
normal space and time. But when the sidewalk ends, there is
inevitably that jolt that can send you sprawling. The wipeout after
the rush.</TE>
<TE>   Driving in L.A. is a bit like a drug, especially when you're
driving roads you've traveled for years. Just making a certain series
of familiar turns can put you in the zone--without thinking about it,
you're on your way to work, or the store, or your brother's house.
Sometimes you find yourself halfway to a place that was not your
original destination--I can't count how many times I automatically
headed for work even though it was Saturday and I had set out for the
beach or Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   But most days, it works out fine--one level of the mind is busy
watching for red lights and reckless drivers, while another level is
grappling with the great issues of our time. When are we as a nation
ever going to address the health and child-care crises? How can I get
Fiona to wear her Easter hat long enough to get her picture taken?</TE>
<TE>   See, in the car, thoughts and images come with absolutely no
strings attached. There is no one there to make you implement them on
the spot, no boss hovering over your shoulder, no therapist pointing
out the flaws of your argument. Transitions are unnecessary,
exposition unimportant, everything is action and the things you will
say and do later today or next week or some year glitter and shine
with self-contained perfection.</TE>
<TE>   That's the perfect narrative structure for your novel and yes, you
will be able to find 35 engineer hats for less than a dollar apiece.
No doubt Jodie Foster will be thrilled to buy your film treatment and
President Bush will see the wisdom of your argument, and, that's it,
you can make a delicious quiche with soy milk and, of course, that
soy milk you bought last month is still good.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller thoughts bob amid the grand schemes, sudden bursts of good
intent--gotta get shoelaces, tomorrow is Mom's birthday--and they too
are wiped away like doodles on an Etch-a-Sketch when the car comes to
a halt. Opening the door, it's as if that half hour, or hour, or four
hours had not occurred, as if the car had driven itself and you had
slept right through it.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe my friend is right. Just as some people reach for a
journal the moment they wake to capture their nocturnal imaginings,
maybe we should all have notebooks stashed in the glove compartment.</TE>
<TE>   Fleet and telling, car dreams are still dreams, after all, and
genius strikes at the most inopportune times, even, perhaps, while
the guy in front of you is making a left out of the right-hand lane
without bothering to use his turn signal.</TE>

<LD>How Many Tortillas?</LD>
<LD>   How are batteries, gasoline and tortillas alike? They all store
energy. Of course, the energy they store is used in different ways by
different things. Cell phones can't run on gasoline and people can't
run on batteries. But even so, the energy stored in these different
ways is really the same stuff.</LD>
<LD>   Just for fun, let's compare how many tortillas it would take to
operate an automobile, a very small, robotic spacecraft or you. The
spacecraft we will use is called Space Technology 5. Three of these
tiny craft will be launched into Earth orbit by NASA in several years
to test new technologies. So, about how many tortillas would it take
to operate each of these energy-users for one day?</LD>
<TE>   * One Space Technology 5 spacecraft: 4.4 tortillas</TE>
<TE>   * A human being: 14-20 tortillas</TE>
<TE>   * An automobile: 12,192 tortillas</TE>

<TE>   This book was about a Chumash boy who liked to swim with the
dolphins. One day his grandfather told him a story about the
beautiful island of Limuw.</TE>
<TE>   The island was too noisy and crowded, so the Earth goddess Hutash

<HD>To Bookseller, Officers' Try at a Search Warrants a Fight</HD>
<DH>A Denver drug probe clashes with aims to keep the public's
reading choices private.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Joyce Meskis didn't have any warning when the five policemen marched
into her office that day, search warrant in hand. They were there to
search the sales records of Meskis' Tattered Cover Bookstore, a
Denver landmark, as part of an investigation into a small-time drug
operation.</LD>
<LD>   "I was dumbfounded," said the 60-year-old, whose bookstore is one
of the largest independently owned in the country. "We had never
faced a search warrant before."</LD>
<LD>   In a matter of minutes, she was on the phone to her lawyer, who
advised her to politely decline to cooperate. With that, the battle
was joined in what has become one of the most prominent 1st Amendment
cases in the country. Now, two years later, the Colorado Supreme
Court is expected to issue an opinion this spring about whether the
police have the authority to search the Tattered Cover's sales
records and, by extension, the records of other Colorado bookstores.</LD>
<TE>   The case could decide whether booksellers have the right, even the
responsibility, to keep their customers' purchases confidential.
Losing that right, activists say, could influence what publishers are
willing to print and what bookstores are willing to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The drug lab investigation was one in a growing trend by law
enforcement agencies to seek computer records from booksellers to
assist in building a criminal case. The first of these cases occurred
in 1998, when independent counsel Kenneth Starr subpoenaed two
Washington bookstores during his investigation of Monica Lewinsky's
affair with then-President Bill Clinton. That effort was sidetracked
by Lewinsky's agreement to cooperate with Starr's investigation, but
it opened the door to other attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the Lewinsky case already on the books, Meskis had no
inkling of the judicial odyssey she was about to embark upon, one
that has become a cause celebre in the civil rights and literary
communities nationwide. In January, San Francisco's A Clean
Well-Lighted Place for Books--itself an institution of sorts--held a
fund-raiser that took in more than $10,000 to help defray the
Tattered Cover's legal costs. Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael
Chabon and author Dorothy Allison attended, saying the case threatens
the right to read without fear of prying government eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the right to privacy," Chabon said. "I believe in
the freedom to read what one chooses. As a writer, a reader and an
American, I truly hold the 1st Amendment sacred."</TE>
<TE>   The case arose when a narcotics detail was staking out a trailer
in suburban Denver where agents suspected a methamphetamine lab was
operating. As part of the surveillance, the police routinely combed
through the trailer's trash and, at one point, came across a Tattered
Cover shipping envelope, which had an invoice number on the front.</TE>
<TE>   When police raided the trailer, they found two nearly new books by
humorously bogus authors: "Advanced Techniques of Psychedelic and
Amphetamine Manufacture," by Uncle Fester, and "The Construction and
Operation of Clandestine Drug Laboratories," by Jack B. Nimble. The
books fit neatly into the envelope found in the trash, so
investigators hoped to bolster their case by connecting the trailer
owner to the drug how-to books. But to do so, they said they needed
to see the Tattered Cover's computerized records to match the invoice
number.</TE>
<TE>   According to an appeals brief filed by Dan Recht, the Tattered
Cover lawyer, investigators had to shop around before they could find
a district attorney willing to approve a search warrant for the
bookstore. When they finally did get one, police showed up
unannounced to go through the Tattered Cover files.</TE>
<TE>   Meskis, who leans toward cardigan sweaters and comfortable shoes,
remembered, as she put it, "trying to beam thoughts" for the police
to stop because she knew the case was one she would have to fight.
Over the years the 1st Amendment protections that cover publishing
books and newspapers have evolved to cover the institutions that sell
them as well.</TE>
<TE>   The police, for their part, saw no difference between a bookstore
and a hardware store in searching for and confiscating records. They
simply wanted to link the owner of the trailer with the books found
during the drug raid. What they probably did not know was that Meskis
is one of the more formidable advocates of 1st Amendment rights in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Joyce is a very stubborn lady," said Chris Finan, president of
the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression. "Her
philosophy is that people should make their own decisions about what
they read, and her job is to make available to her customers what
they request."</TE>
<TE>   Meskis, among other things, is the recipient of the William J.
Brennan Jr. and PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment awards, which honor
those devoted to free expression. She has led a number of 1st
Amendment fights in Colorado, including a successful 1994 campaign to
stop a proposed constitutional amendment that would have made it
easier for communities to label materials as obscene.</TE>
<TE>   "We sell any book that is constitutionally protected," said
Meskis, seated in the comfortable, homey office of her downtown
Denver store. "Once we start imposing our value system on you, the
customer, we firmly plant our feet on a slippery slope."</TE>
<TE>   Booksellers Afraid</TE>
<TE>   to Open the Gates</TE>
<TE>   After the police tried to execute the search warrant, Recht
arranged for a week's grace period with the Denver district
attorney's office, long enough to file for a temporary restraining
order to stop the search and bring the case to court. But in October
2000, a Denver district judge ordered the bookstore to reveal the
requested information about the invoice found in the trash can, which
led to the state Supreme Court challenge.</TE>
<TE>   In arguments before that court in December, the lawyer for the
police, Andrew Nathan, said that the invoice information was an
essential piece of evidence needed in the case. Recht countered that
it was not and that police had not done everything else in their
power to find out who bought the books. "Our impression is that law
enforcement sees [such searches] as a new tool and is pushing to use
it," Recht said. "From the bookseller's point of view, it has scary
repercussions. It could open gates."</TE>
<TE>   Judith Krug, director of the office for intellectual freedom for
the American Library Assn., likened the Tattered Cover case to the
time in 1970 when law enforcement officials began combing library
records for clues to criminal activity. Specifically, they were
trying to find out who checked out books on bomb-making after a lab
at the University of Wisconsin was blown up by left-wing radicals.</TE>
<TE>   "I was horrified," said Krug, who then began a 30-year campaign to
protect library circulation records. Today, only Kentucky and Hawaii
don't have laws protecting the privacy of what readers check out from
libraries. She said combing through charge records had a similarly
ominous tone.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought of a law enforcement officer accessing my charge
records and then determining what kind of person I am on the basis of
what I read would bother me tremendously," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other prominent cases involved a Los Angeles bookstore and
Seattle bookselling giant Amazon.com. The Los Angeles case centered
on an FBI probe into possible illegal gifts, apparently including
books, received by U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.). As part of
that investigation, the FBI subpoenaed several bookstores around the
country, seeking data on the purchases Torricelli and seven others
made over the previous 6 1/2 years. Among those subpoenaed was
Arundel's bookstore, with shops in Los Angeles and Seattle. The owner
of the stores, Phil Bevis, refused to turn over any information to
FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   "The feds' conduct in this case is reprehensible," Bevis said.
"They really colored outside the lines on this one. They are supposed
to [show they] need the information and, second, they are supposed to
explore other ways of getting it. This was a fishing expedition."</TE>
<TE>   Bevis said FBI agents arrived at the Beverly Boulevard bookstore
in August and began interrogating his staff on the spot. He said he
decided from the outset not to provide the information requested.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided we were not going to comply, period," he said. "If the
ground rules changed so that we were forced to comply, we were going
to close. It was a gut check. I can't be a bookseller if those are
the rules." The Justice Department backed off on the subpoenas in
September and announced in January that it would not file charges
against Torricelli. While it was at least a partial victory for
Bevis, it also was an expensive one. "It's going to take me until
2003 to pay off my legal bills," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Amazon case took place two years ago when Ohio authorities
subpoenaed the company for records of anyone in the Greater Cleveland
area who had purchased the "Cyborgasm I" and "Cyborgasm II" compact
discs. The request was part of an investigation into a stalker who
had sent the CDs--along with lingerie and other items--to 42 women
over a three-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon responded by saying it could not reply to an out-of-state
subpoena. When Ohio investigators persisted, Amazon took it to the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Amazon did not have to turn over anything. The company
also found out that the chief suspect in the case, Cleveland radio
and television personality Joel Rose, had committed suicide after he
was publicly named as a suspect. He left a note in which he claimed
his innocence, saying, "When your integrity is destroyed, you have
nothing." The case remains unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Court and</TE>
<TE>   Individual Liberties</TE>
<TE>   In the Denver case, Recht said he is pinning some hope for success
on the fact that the Colorado Supreme Court has a history of landing
on the side of individual liberties. He said the decision will be
cutting edge, no matter what the ruling, because no other state
supreme court has ruled on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Bevis, meanwhile, wondered how many other bookstores had been
approached whose owners didn't have the will or the money to fight
the government. "God only knows how often it's happened," he said.
"And the stores that roll over, you'll never know about."</TE>
<TE>   In Denver, the criminal investigation that started the Tattered
Cover's ordeal has taken a back seat to the 1st Amendment case. Only
one charge was ever filed in the meth lab bust, and that was later
dropped. Authorities don't know where the four people who were under
investigation now are.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1988, charismatic jazz musician Chet Baker, by then suffering from
the dissipation of drug addiction, fell to his death from the window
of a hotel in Amsterdam. The fall was officially declared an
accident. But the lack of a witness led to the inevitable rumors that
he'd jumped or even that he'd been pushed. In "Looking for Chet
Baker" (Walker, $24.95, 254 pages), the fifth Evan Horne mystery,
professional drummer and music critic Bill Moody sends his fictional
piano-playing hero on a quest to find the truth about Baker's death.</LD>
<LD>   When an old pal, Professor Charles "Ace" Buffington, asks Horne to
help with his research on Baker, the pianist refuses. Such sleuthing
(most recently in the mystery "Bird Lives!") has left him emotionally
rocky and peevish about his reputation as a musician being superceded
by his fame as a detective. But when he arrives for a club date in
Amsterdam, he discovers that Buffington, who'd been digging into
Baker's death, has gone missing, apparently a victim of foul play.</LD>
<TE>   The book hits all the right notes as it swings from Horne's
reluctant investigation to his settling into the city's jazz scene.
Moody shrewdly mixes suspense with smartly rendered conversation
about Baker's life, jazzmen in general (Billy Strayhorn was only 16
when he wrote "Lush Life," an expatriate tenor man notes), classic
recordings, the blues versus Broadway happy tunes and, inevitably,
drugs. Horne narrates the proceedings in the present tense, a device
that can be unwieldy but, used properly, as it is here, it adds a
sense of immediacy that draws us closer. The book has the potential
for turning mystery lovers into jazz fans. And vice versa.</TE>

<TE>   "The Wicked Flea" (Berkley, $21.95, 304 pages) is not merely
author Susan Conant's latest canine-fancier reply to Lillian Jackson
Braun's popular "Cat Who ..." series. It is a fiction that delights
in dogs, abounds in dogs, revels in dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Most mystery dog tales feature owner and pet as a sort of
sleuthing team that venture into the ordinary world as we know it. An
example is Carol Lea Benjamin's surprisingly gritty "The Long Good
Boy" (Walker) in which private detective Rachel Alexander is
accompanied by her pit bull, Dash, as she investigates the murder of
a transsexual prostitute in Manhattan. "Flea," a cozy mystery set in
Cambridge, rarely departs from the dog park and when it does, its
focus remains so steadfastly on mankind's best friends that the
murder of an unpleasant, insensitive dog owner and the subsequent
search for the killer seem almost beside the point.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the book's narrator and amateur sleuth, Holly Winter, is
concerned, it's a dog's world. She's the proud owner-trainer of two
well-behaved Alaskan malamutes. She writes a column in Dog's Life
magazine and is assembling a canine cookbook titled "A Hundred and
One Ways to Cook Liver." A landlady, she won't rent to anyone who
doesn't have a pet. She uses phrases like "this undogly hour." The
love of her life is--what else?--a veterinarian.</TE>
<TE>   But she let him slip away and his recent marriage has sent her to
a therapist because she didn't just lose a lover, she lost an
excellent health-care source for her malamutes. When the owner of an
undisciplined golden retriever is found murdered in the park, Holly
and her dogs are drawn into the investigation, but she doesn't let
that stop her from Kennel Club chat or breeder facts and figures.</TE>
<TE>   Conant has populated the novel with an interesting cast of humans
and animals, particularly the victim's ghastly family. And there's a
fair amount of humor. But the real appeal here is for those readers
looking for a novel with, to coin a Holly-like phrase, dog in the
details.</TE>
<TE>   Eve Dallas Is Back</TE>
<TE>   to the Near Future</TE>
<TE>   Romance novelist Nora Roberts uses the pen name J.D. Robb for her
mass market paperbacks featuring Eve Dallas, a hard-boiled NYPD
detective. Dallas searches for truth and justice in the near future,
when a cop has to deal not only with rapists and murderers but also
with witches, demons and mystics. The current entry in the series,
"Reunion in Death" (Berkley, $7.99, 384 pages), limits the New Age
aspects to a secondary plot involving the visiting parents of Dallas'
efficient assistant, Peabody. Mom has the power to cloud minds; Dad
is ultra-empathic.</TE>
<TE>   The main story is played relatively straight and it's worth a
read. Julianna Dunne, a murderer Dallas sent to prison a decade ago,
has been paroled. She wastes no time in starting to bump off men of
influence in an attempt to draw Dallas into a game of homicidal
cat-and-mouse in which the policewoman will lose everything she holds
near and dear.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts' mixture of suspense and romance (Dallas is married to one
of the wealthiest, most powerful, most sensitive, most loving and
generous men in the known universe) is pretty potent. But she's also
provided her protagonist with an especially complex history and
psychology that should fascinate readers not usually drawn to
paperback originals.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the otherworldly trappings may strike the serious crime
fiction fan as silly. But there are sections of the
book--particularly one describing her visit to the Texas neighborhood
of her youth where she relives the horrendous abuse and savagery of
an early life with father--that more than compensate for the effort
it takes to flip past the less-inspired parts.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Lochte, the author of the prize-winning novel "Sleeping Dog"
and its sequel, "Laughing Dog" (Poisoned Pen Press), reviews
mysteries every other Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Game Has Promised Land on the Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can you name the ancient Greek practice that is the model for the
Passover Seder?</LD>
<LD>   That's one of the tougher questions Syndi Kercher came up with for
her new "Exodus, the Game of Passover." She stumped a rabbi with it.
In fact, the Seder, which marks the beginning of the holiday week
Wednesday evening, is modeled after a Greek symposium, where
philosophers compared notes over dinner, she says.</LD>
<LD>   Three years ago, Kercher, then 34, was a schoolteacher in Tucson,
with much experience creating educational play for kids. After a
ho-hum Passover with her family, she decided to apply her skills at
home.</LD>
<TE>   "My kids were getting lackadaisical," says Kercher, whose son and
daughter were preteens at the time. "They just sat around waiting for
the matzo ball soup."</TE>
<TE>   Obstacles inspire her. "I told my grandma I wanted to be in charge
of Passover the next year," she says. Grandma agreed, and at the next
Seder, Kercher brought along a prototype for her game.</TE>
<TE>   The whole family played. "It was a blast," Kercher recalls. Based
loosely on Monopoly and a trivia game, the Exodus board shows the
route the Israelites followed as they escaped slavery in Egypt and
traveled through the Sinai desert to Canaan, the Promised Land.</TE>
<TE>   Players draw questions and then move ahead if they give the right
answer. They also get chances to spin the "wheel of plagues" and to
send their opponents back to Egypt or prevent them from taking a
turn. Seder plate chips can be used to block the plagues, allowing
players to be "passed over" without being harmed. The first to reach
the Promised Land wins.</TE>
<TE>   Since Kercher's family first played the game, she has gone through
an exodus of her own, leaving teaching to devote her time to
exploring the board-game business, with several other new games now
in the works. She started by scouting the competition at toy fairs
and Judaica shops. A graphic artist friend helped her package her
product and put it on the market, priced at $24.95. Judaica stores
around the country, including the Mitzvah Store in Los Angeles, stock
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Marge Eiseman, a Hebrew school teacher in Milwaukee, discovered
Kercher's game at an educational conference. She bought one for her
fourth-graders and one for her three children to play at home. Her
students cheer when she takes out the game and divides the class into
teams. "We play it a few weeks before Passover so I can find out what
the students need to learn," she says. After a few history lessons,
they play again, and Eiseman measures the students' improvement by
the number of questions they get wrong. At a match last week, there
were only three or four incorrect answers.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the game's questions lead to what Eiseman calls "teachable
moments." How long does Passover last? It depends on whom you ask.
Reform Jews say there are seven days, Conservative and Orthodox Jews
say eight. "The extra day is added to mourn the destruction of the
Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD," Eiseman says. "Reform Jews
don't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Researching Jewish history for the game changed Kercher's feelings
about her religion. Raised Jewish, she always celebrated the major
holidays but never considered herself to be devout. Lately, though,
she is a regular at Friday night services, after which she, her
husband and teenage children sit down to a Sabbath dinner.</TE>

<HD>The Call of the Cards</HD>
<DH>A brother and sister are lured from ivory-tower academia to
the cutthroat world of professional high-stakes poker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT SURMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Annie Duke, a suburban mother of four, is the product of a New
Hampshire boarding school and two Ivy League universities and was
once poised for a life in academia. Her brother, Howard Lederer,
followed a similar track: St. Paul's School in New Hampshire, then on
to Columbia University.</LD>
<LD>   Now they are professional poker players.</LD>
<LD>   Together, they have earned poker celebrity--for being siblings,
for being smart and for making a lot of money in a game that
sometimes still has the aura of the Wild West. Lederer, 38, has been
World Champion in two events, garnering two coveted gold bracelets
and making a name for himself among the golden lights of poker, such
living legends as "Texas Dolly" Doyle Brunson and David "Chip" Reese.</LD>
<TE>   Duke, 36, was nine months pregnant when she made the final table
at the World Series of Poker two years ago. Some people--men--thought
it was a little weird that a pregnant woman would play. She was
incredulous. Did anyone really think that after all this time--and
with all her experience--a little excitement would send her into
labor?</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day at a tournament at the California Commerce Club
casino in the City of Commerce, where the pot eventually grows to
$1.7 million, Lederer is not doing so well. At this early game, his
competitors include a guy in shades and gold chains with a portable
fan whirring in front of him. Another is the editor of Card Player
magazine. Satin jackets and baseball caps abound.</TE>
<TE>   They play hand after hand after hand, almost mechanically. There
is little emotion and little excitement so early. Lederer will play
today's game for 12 hours, getting up once every couple of hours for
10-minute breaks. The clatter of chips sounds like a slot-machine
parlor, as 600 players nervously clink them through their fingers. By
game's end, only one person will have won any money.</TE>
<TE>   Players bet based on two cards dealt to them and a communal set of
five cards in the middle. Lederer is going through his chips quickly,
when someone says: "You're the best poker player at the table, you
don't need chips."</TE>
<TE>   He answers: "Even a fine craftsman needs good tools."</TE>
<TE>   And on this day, his tools aren't good enough (though at another
tournament here the following week, he took home $5,000).</TE>
<TE>   For Lederer and Duke, losing is all part of the job. Duke has lost
$50,000 in the span of two weeks. That's fine, if "very annoying,"
she says. She expects to make it back and, indeed, reports a few
weeks later that she has.</TE>
<TE>   The siblings are, in some ways, notable for their very
middle-classness, if only because of how long they've stuck around in
a crowd that isn't known for stability. "Usually, there's a lot of
people that come and go, but Howard manages his money well," says
Phil Hellmuth, one of the top tournament players in the country.</TE>
<TE>   A big man--about 6 feet, 5 inches tall with an imposing girth and
a disarming smile--Lederer is serious and mathematical. He could be a
stock analyst and answers questions as though he were, with business
talk and formulas. At one point, he talks about luck: "If luck is L
and time is T ..." he begins, setting up the kind of math equation
that peppers his talk.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in New York at 18, fresh out of prep school to attend
Columbia. He had been a chess wiz at boarding school and was
immediately drawn to the competitive chess clubs downtown. They were
homes to the smart and eccentric. But back-room poker, with its
dangerous and sleazy glamour, was even more of a draw. "The allure
was gambling."</TE>
<TE>   He skipped out on school and studied poker hard. He returned to
Columbia for a year, but decided he had more of a future in gambling.
He spent the next 10 years moving up through the city's table limits.
In 1994, he had exhausted the resources of New York's underground
clubs, so he packed his stuff and moved to Las Vegas, where the
action is bigger and out in the open. He now plays nontournament
high-stakes games at the Bellagio a couple times a week and, when the
pots are big enough, travels to tournaments as far away as
Mississippi and London.</TE>
<TE>   His sister is chatty and vivacious, with a brush of brown bangs
and an enthusiasm that can sometimes rattle her opponents. Her kids
range from a newborn to a 7-year-old, but she does not consider
herself a soccer mom--even though one of her children "does play
soccer and I do go to her games." Her husband works on his own small
venture capital projects.</TE>
<TE>   Duke's start was very simple: She was a Columbia grad and was
nearly done with a doctoral program in psycholinguistics at the
University of Pennsylvania, but when it came time to defend her
doctoral thesis, she quite literally got sick to her stomach. "I knew
that wasn't a good sign," she says. She decided she just couldn't
take the academic track anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Newly married and living in a rustic cabin in Montana about 10
years ago, she called her brother, who had tutored her in poker in
the past, and asked him to help her get started as a pro. He gave her
some more advice and sent her a couple thousand dollars in backup
money, and she was ready.</TE>
<TE>   Soon she was a champion of small stakes games in Montana, so she
headed to Vegas where the failures of untold hometown champions
preceded her. Now she plays the biggest games in town several days a
week and is a regular celebrity player on the Web site ulti
matebet.com, where she pits her skill against challengers. At the
Bellagio, Lederer is as often as not one of her challengers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not brother and sister at the poker table," Duke says. "If
my emotions were that ratcheted up, I'd be a pretty bad player." Once
they leave the table, they are very clearly siblings again. "Whenever
I do well, I am referred to as the brother of Annie Duke," Lederer
says. "I just find it amusing, considering I taught her to play."</TE>
<TE>   It is a world far removed from their old-money boarding school
upbringings, but perhaps truer to their natures.</TE>
<TE>   "To St. Paul's people, their lives project this image of freedom,
a lack of restraints," says Katy Lederer, their 29-year-old sister,
who is at work on a memoir, "Poker Face: Growing Up in a Family of
Gamblers," to be published next year by Crown Books. "All the things
preppies don't do are done in Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   In Vegas, deceit is written into the game. Katy Lederer says it's
the opposite of boarding school. Lie to a guy's face in poker, be
openly ruthless, and he's still a good buddy later. "It's all about
the con, but you have fun and you have friends too," Howard Lederer
says.</TE>
<TE>   The Lederers were always a little different at St. Paul's. The
children of faculty--their father is Richard Lederer, the author of
"Anguished English" and other books that chronicle the eccentricities
of the language--they didn't have the blue blood of their
schoolmates.</TE>
<TE>   But they did have the instinct for competition that has come in
handy in Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "The household was very competitive," says Katy Lederer, who made
her own short-lived attempt at poker fame after graduating from UC
Berkeley. "It wasn't just the card games; it was who got to eat the
last Oreo, who decided the show [to watch] on TV. Everything was
cutthroat in that household."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Lederer and Duke project an image of normalcy, but it is
clear that it is normalcy only within the realms of poker. The poker
economy is a different world, one that rewards the analyst, but
sometimes even more the risk taker. Duke compares her job to options
trading.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the Commerce tournament, Howard Lederer taps
Hellmuth for the $500 he owes Duke. Hellmuth peels off five $100
bills, although he says he doesn't remember owing Annie any money.
Still, he is unfazed; money is just a way of keeping score.</TE>
<TE>   Hellmuth tells a story: He once invited Lederer to his Palo Alto
home for a weekend. After the visit, as they waited for Lederer's
flight home, they got into a friendly little game. Lederer either won
or lost $25,000 in the hour before the flight left. Hellmuth doesn't
remember which. "Part of it is understanding that chips are power.
They're just units," Duke says. "You can't say, 'Oh, God, this is my
mortgage payment.'"</TE>
<TE>   The siblings dance around how much money they net in a year. It's
up and down and changeable, they say, but, clearly, they are doing
well. They own comfortable homes in exclusive areas of town, with
doctors and casino executives for neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Both Lederer and Duke, whose friends from college are now
professors and business people, say they plan to play for a long
time. They each have a tremendous faith in their ongoing ability to
make money in the bubble that is Las Vegas. "If I win or lose half a
million dollars, life won't change a bit," Lederer says.</TE>

<LD>"Mommy, what if the wind blew the garden gate shut before Brownie and
her baby chicks could get back to their chicken coop? There are no
bushes or covered places anywhere in the garden for them to go,"
Sarah said worriedly.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah's mother walked over and put her arm around Sarah's
shoulders. "Well, Brownie will fluff up her feathers and put her
chicks underneath her. A mother hen knows how to keep her babies safe
and dry."</LD>
<LD>   "I know, Mommy," Sarah said, "but Brownie might have to sit there
all day with the rain pouring down on her. She wouldn't like that at
all!"</LD>
<TE>   Sarah looked anxiously at her mother who looked back at her and
said, "All right, dear, we will go out to the garden to see if
Brownie is there and needs help. If we have to bring the baby chicks
back to the kitchen, we will need something to carry them in."</TE>
<TE>   "What about my Easter basket? I'll empty the eggs out of it,"
Sarah said quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, that's a great idea," her mother said, "and I'll get
something to put over the basket." She found a soft kitchen towel and
handed it to Sarah.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah got busy. She took the 12 colored eggs out of the Easter
basket and laid them on the table. She then lifted out the nest of
artificial grass and put it in the center of the table and carefully
placed the eggs back in the grass nest. Next, she hurried and put on
her yellow rain boots, grabbed her empty Easter basket and called,
"Mommy, I'm ready to go!"</TE>
<TE>   Sarah's mother grabbed her big black umbrella, and they ran out
into the rainy morning. They went along the side of the farmhouse and
crossed over to the flower garden. Sure enough, a gust of wind had
shut the garden gate! There was Brownie all fluffed up with her head
down, clucking to her chicks huddling under her.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to special-occasion dinners, it's reassuring to rely on
a versatile trio of recipes that are proven winners. No need to
reinvent a menu every time.</LD>
<LD>   These do-ahead dishes can be served warm or at room temperature.
Serve them buffet-style, if you'd like. The tenderloin recipe is an
old standby; I've yet to find a better version. The tenderloin is
marinated in a fresh-herb mixture and grilled (or broiled) until
medium rare. Paired with a red pepper and onion marmalade, which is a
substantial vegetable garnish, it's perfect for serving on a plate or
a buttered warm roll (with Dijon mustard). The baked orzo makes an
ideal companion.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the menu is yours. I always add a salad--a bowl of
romaine lettuce and tender greens or haricots verts, arugula and pine
nuts, both with simple vinaigrette. Typically, a selection of cheeses
with baguette slices follows. For dessert, choose a festive cake from
your favorite bakery and pass a bowl of strawberries.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Red Onion and Red Pepper Marmalade</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 35 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 red bell peppers</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, halved and thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons minced fresh basil</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   Heat the broiler.</TE>
<TE>   Stand the peppers on their ends and cut them into 4 flat sides and
remove the seeds. Arrange the peppers skin side up in a single layer
on a foil-lined pan and broil until blackened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove them from the oven and wrap the peppers in the foil. Wait
until they're cool enough to handle, then remove the skin. Cut them
into strips and set them aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
When hot, add the onions and sugar. Cook, stirring often, until the
onions are lightly colored--not dark brown--about 10 minutes. Stir in
the vinegar, mustard and salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onions
are soft, about 7 minutes more. Stir in the red peppers; heat
through. Adjust the seasoning. (This can be made several days ahead
and refrigerated. To serve, gently reheat even if serving at room
temperature). Stir in the basil, thyme and rosemary. When hot, stir
in the butter until melted. Taste; adjust seasoning. Serve hot or at
room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grilled Herbed Tenderloin</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour plus
8 hours marinating</TE>
<TE>   For a smoky nuance, add a few pieces of water-soaked apple,
hickory or mesquite wood to the grill.</TE>
<TE>   1 (3-pound) piece tenderloin, trimmed of visible fat</TE>
<TE>   2 large cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 large shallot, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup minced mixed fresh herbs, such as basil, thyme and
rosemary</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Red Pepper and Onion Marmalade</TE>
<TE>   Fresh herb sprigs, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Place the tenderloin in a large plastic food bag. Combine the
garlic, shallot, mustard, vinegar, oil, herbs, 1 teaspoon of salt and
the pepper in a small dish. Add to the meat. Work through the bag to
coat the meat. Tightly seal the bag to keep all the meat covered in
the marinade. Place the bag in a bowl. Refrigerate the meat
overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Let the meat come to room
temperature before grilling.</TE>
<TE>   Prepare a medium-hot barbecue fire with a few chunks of
water-soaked wood. Alternatively, place the broiler rack 8 inches
from the heat source; heat to medium-high heat. Drain the meat;
reserve the marinade. Lightly sprinkle the meat with more salt.</TE>
<TE>   Grill or broil the tenderloin until cooked as desired, brushing
with the reserved marinade and turning as necessary. Depending on the
heat, it may take as long as 15 to 20 minutes to cook the meat; an
instant-read thermometer should register 125 degrees for medium rare,
130 degrees for medium. Tent loosely with foil; let the meat rest at
least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</TE>
<TE>   Serve the meat hot or at room temperature. Cut it into thin slices
close to serving time. Arrange the marmalade on a platter. Overlap
the tenderloin slices attractively on the marmalade. Spoon
accumulated pan juices over the meat. Garnish the platter with herb
sprigs.</TE>

<HD>In This Case, the Chicken Came First</HD>
<DH>Read the diary: What started out as plan for getting fresh
eggs turned into a way of life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Kyle Pratt's house, the chickens came before the eggs. Last July,
his parents bought four chicks for his seventh birthday. The idea was
that he would have the birds for pets and, in a couple of months, his
family would have a steady supply of eggs.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the chickens are not only good providers but the stars of
play dates.</LD>
<LD>   "To my mind," says Kyle's mother, Karen Haas, "chickens are the
perfect pets." She argues that Los Angeles is long overdue for a
renaissance in backyard chicken-keeping, particularly in her
neighborhood, West Adams, a large area of historic homes southwest of
downtown. Their large gardens, many with old stables, can usually
satisfy the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services requirement
that chicken coops be stationed at least 20 feet from the owner's
house and 35 feet from any other dwelling. (Crowing roosters, alas,
are verboten.)</LD>
<TE>   Haas and husband Paul Pratt had spent years restoring their
Craftsman-era house but so far had done little to the garden. When
Kyle declared an interest in chickens for his birthday, it was
decided that the first serious garden feature would be a chicken
coop.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, observed Kyle, started "loading up on chicken
information." The Tamara Staples book, "The Fairest Fowl" (Chronicle,
2001), proved an essential frivolity: a book of chicken portraits
revealing varieties of plumage that could leave a peacock envious.</TE>
<TE>   But these were show birds. The Murray McMurray Hatchery chicken
catalog, from a poultry firm out of Webster City, Iowa, proved a more
realistic guide to what kind of birds are for sale, though Haas would
buy the birds at Red Barn Feed and Saddlery in Tarzana rather than
have a minimum order of 25 chicks shipped from Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Haas wanted good-natured birds, not squawkers. After long
deliberation, she settled on the classic egg hen, the Rhode Island
Red, which she and Kyle named Ginger, a black-and-white Plymouth
Barred Rock (Doris) and two gold Buff Orpingtons (Vivien and Violet).</TE>
<TE>   It is important for a flock dynamic that chickens be the same age,
Haas learned. Ginger, born on the Fourth of July, was a week older
than the other girls when Haas and Pratt brought them home last
summer. She would clearly be top chicken. As the family set up a
chicken nursery under the stairs leading to the attic, Kyle began a
chicken diary to commemorate the event. "There was chick food and
water and a heat lamp and thermometer. They liked it a lot warmer
than we did," he recorded.</TE>
<TE>   He became the surrogate parent: "I always sat down to hold them
and tried to be very peaceful."</TE>
<TE>   As feathers started emerging from their down, Doris the Plymouth
Barred Rock began trying to keep up with older Ginger. "Doris is the
trouble-maker," wrote Kyle after a scary incident in which Doris was
found hanging, her foot entangled in a clothespin that had been used
to clip the netting around the brood pen. But a visiting neighbor
revived Doris, who now only has a slight limp.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle's parents purchased an outdoor cage, and he started taking
the chicks outside on warm days and bringing them back in at night.
Meanwhile, Haas was busy ordering a deluxe coop. An Anglophile, she
insisted on a henhouse from a company called Forsham Cottage Arks in
Kent, England. It arrived in September, shipped in panels, like
pieces of a prefabricated house. Coop in place, the 8-week-old birds
were moved outside. "When I checked on them they were all huddled
together on the same perch, asleep and comfortable," recorded Kyle.</TE>
<TE>   Comfort is an understatement. There is an open-air common area in
this chicken Hilton, then a ramp up to a nesting area. In centuries
of chicken keeping, coop designers have studied and come to
accommodate every chicken habit and need, including foraging,
perching, brooding and pooping. For those squeamish about mess, it's
worth noting that the droppings collect neatly in a cleverly
fashioned pit. The chickens are so unlikely to foul the other living
areas of the coop that Haas estimates she cleans the coop once a
month, and it takes only 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The chickens are only allowed out when there is someone to watch
them, since the neighborhood predators include a local hawk and
housecats. "After school I let them out into the garden to snoop and
forage," Kyle writes. "They run around in a pack." Doris likes
hopping on his shoulder. "She's like a parrot," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle knew something was up when, early last February, he "heard
strange sounds coming from the coop." Ginger, he noticed, was acting
oddly. She didn't come out with the other chickens: "When she did
come out she would lift up her wings a little bit and squat." Ginger
was about to lay her first egg, quickly followed by the
ever-competitive Doris.</TE>
<TE>   The family set up nesting boxes in the coop and has been getting a
steady succession of eggs from all the birds since then. Every time
an egg is laid, the birds let rip with an exultant chorus of clucks.
"We probably have to eat more eggs now," Kyle says. His mother roars
with laughter at this, and says neighbors like getting the ones they
don't eat. They are smaller and have better texture and taste than
store-bought ones, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Feeding the chickens is relatively simple, Haas says. The feed is
a mix of store-bought grain, mineral supplement, kitchen vegetable
trimmings and garden insects. "They clear our garden of snails and
just love those little slugs," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In the last nine months, the birds have succumbed to routine
cuddling by Kyle and his 2-year-old sister Lydia. When Lydia creeps
up behind them, they even bend down, to accommodate the lift and hug
they know will follow. But occasionally, says Kyle, they get fed up.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't over-love them," he warns, making a rocking and smoochy
face gesture. "If you over-love them, they get fed up and peck you in
the least place you need to be pecked."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Lydia, runs into the kitchen clutching a warm,
freshly-laid egg. She sets it on a chair next to her mother, peers at
it, and says, "Hi, egg."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the A-to-Z of backyard chicken keeping, Haas recommends
"Chickens in your Backyard: A Beginner's Guide" by Rick and Gail
Luttmann (Rodale Press, 1997).</TE>

palatable, and hikers can choose from a wide range of backpackable
meals. Throughout history, though, soldiers on campaign, sailors and
all travelers in remote areas have carried much simpler snacks that
have been called iron rations: foods that keep indefinitely and
require minimal preparation.</LD>
<LD>   Usually this meant dried meat and ready-to-eat grain products,
such as hard biscuits (hardtack) or parched (that is, toasted) grain,
which needs only the addition of water to make a sort of porridge. In
some areas, dried fish would substitute for jerky--in southern
Arabia, it's dried shark (lakhm); in Siberia, a sort of flour of
ground dried fish (yukola).</LD>
<LD>   All these foods were suitable from the standpoint of keeping body
and soul together, but they could be stale, rancid or infested by
insects by the time you needed to eat them. So they tended to acquire
sardonic nicknames. Civil War soldiers referred to hardtack as "death
bells"; sailors called salt meat "salt junk," meaning salted rope
("junk" was originally a term for scraps of worn-out rope, which
could be put to various uses aboard ship).</LD>
<TE>   But they all had a serious nutritional drawback for long-term
use--they were short on vitamins and posed the danger of scurvy. To
fight this, soldiers during the Civil War were issued dried
vegetables that could be reconstituted in water. Needless to say, in
soldier talk "desiccated vegetables" became "desecrated vegetables."</TE>
<TE>   One exception to the rule was pemmican, a Native American iron
ration consisting of meat pounded with fat and often dried berries.
In its way, it was a bit like the modern backpacker's "gorp." But
even from there, it's a long way to energy bars and freeze-dried
angel hair primavera.</TE>

<LD>Sweet mini-peppers are great for stuffing and make for eye-appealing
hors d'oeuvres. You won't need extra garnishes.</LD>
<LD>   You'll find the peppers in the produce section of warehouse
stores. Or, substitute larger Hungarian green peppers, found at most
grocery stores and farmers markets. Just cut them into strips before
filling.</LD>
<LD>   The light-tasting crab stuffing comes together quickly and can be
made ahead. Or, make the entire appetizer ahead: Stuff the peppers,
arrange them on a platter, then cover and chill until serving time.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Clarita farmers market holds its own during the slower
seasons of winter and early spring. It is a mid-size event that draws
a good selection of local growers.</LD>
<LD>   You wouldn't think that crowds would mob a stand just to buy
carrots, but Sunday Naomi Elmasian barely could handle the customers
clamoring for Sweetness II carrots, crisp and sweet enough to eat for
breakfast, grown by her daughter, Susan, in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Vicente and Irma Suarez had an impressive array of vegetables from
Moorpark, including beautiful spinach, leeks and cilantro and a
forest of tall, leafy celery. From Carpinteria, the Watkins' stand
offered organic red leaf and green leaf lettuces, Red Boar and Red
Russian kale and Red Giant mustard greens, which were larger and
sharper than the regular green kind.</LD>
<TE>   From nearby Canyon Country, Canyon Meadow Farm brought tasty
free-range Araucana eggs with light-green shells, as well as brown
eggs. Jill Peterson of Peterson Ranch sold portabello, oyster and
shiitake mushrooms from Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Joanna Rangel of Piru's Tangelo Rancho had superbly sweet-tart
Minneola tangelos, just $7 for a huge box of premium fruit. The Shore
stand of Santa Paula sold addictively sweet, seedless Pixie
tangerines, along with juicy, deep-colored Washington navel oranges,
Eureka lemons and fine Fuerte avocados, arguably the best variety of
avocado at this season.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Fife of Visalia had Marsh white grapefruit, just now getting
good in the Central Valley, Thompson Improved navels (much sweeter
and juicier than in their commercial season, four months earlier) and
sweet, tender-fleshed Tarocco blood oranges, unblushed on the outside
but splashed with red on the inside.</TE>

<HD>After the Seder, What? The Rest of Passover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARCY GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Passover, which begins tonight, should be joyous. And for the most
part, it is. But it can be stressful to host many people and, at the
same time, keep in mind very specific observances of the Seder meal.
It's nothing if not a minefield of food do's and don'ts.</LD>
<LD>   There's no letup after the two gargantuan Seder feasts, either.
Passover has not passed over. You still have to eat and snack and get
through--if you are observant--six more days and nights of
Passover-correct repasts (no flour, no leavening agents, no fermented
anything, no seeds, no grains, no flour, no mustard etc.).</LD>
<LD>   The trouble is, a cook's energy runs low and his or her
imagination ebbs. Those at the Passover helm can become snarly; those
at the table cringe at the idea of brisket and gefilte fish once
more.</LD>
<TE>   I live in the trenches too, so lately I have devised
after-the-Seder recipes: a matzo-based lasagna, seasoned chicken
fingers and even some great, simple baking.</TE>
<TE>   Meal-makers need not say, "OK. The roast chicken and brisket
parade has passed; if I see another matzo ball and sweet and sour
meatball, I will weep." What's needed is good, easy food, and food
that is not as heavy or as illustrious as Seder fare. In short,
regular stuff made Passover-appropriate. Stuff you would eat anyway,
stuff you can take to work or enjoy after school (kids still are
hungry for cookies and squares).</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the recipes that get my family through the rest
of the Passover week. Some things, such as the Passover Picnic-Style
Chicken, is even better made with matzo meal than with bread crumbs.
Matzo meal makes a terrific breading, and here it results in crunchy,
golden chicken. Matzo comes in handy in Matzo Lasagna, taking the
place of pasta. The dish is made with a bechamel-like sauce.</TE>

<TE>   2 tablespoons minced parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 small clove garlic, minced or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a shallow 6-cup oven-proof

hours</TE>
<TE>   Use prepared marinara sauce if you'd like.</TE>
<TE>   6 to 8 unsalted matzo (not egg matzo)</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, margarine or oil</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons matzo cake meal</TE>

Havarti</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons minced parsley</TE>
<TE>   Dried mixed Italian seasonings, optional</TE>
<TE>   Lightly grease an 11x7-inch casserole. Rinse the matzo briefly
with warm water.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the butter or oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add
the cake meal and stir briefly. Over low heat, briskly whisk in the
milk, a bit at a time, to make a thick bechamel-type sauce. Season
with salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. Remove from the stove
and let cool.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Layer the matzo in the casserole, cutting them to fit, if
necessary. Spoon on some of the sauce, then some marinara sauce and
some of the cheese. Dust with salt, pepper, garlic powder, some
parsley and a dash of Italian spices, if using.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat layering until you have used up all the ingredients--ending
with a layer of shredded cheese over the marinara sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake
until thoroughly heated throughout and the cheese is melted, about 15
to 25 more minutes. Let stand a few minutes before serving.</TE>

<TE>   Passover Picnic-Style Chicken Fingers</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe works equally well with fish filets such as sole or
haddock.</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   About 1/2 cup potato starch</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, beaten</TE>
<TE>   About 1 1/2 cups matzo meal</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon onion powder</TE>
<TE>   Oil, for frying</TE>
<TE>   Slice each chicken breast into 4 or 5 "fingers" about 4 inches
long and 1/2 inch wide.</TE>
<TE>   Lay out a large sheet of wax paper. Set the chicken on one end.
Place the potato starch in a shallow bowl and the eggs in another
bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the matzo meal, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of
pepper, the garlic powder and the onion powder in a third shallow
bowl and place it at the end of the line of bowls. (You are making an
assembly line).</TE>
<TE>   Season the chicken with a little salt and pepper. Dredge each
finger lightly in the potato starch and shake off any excess. Dip the
chicken in the eggs, then press into the seasoned matzo meal. Set the
chicken on a clean piece of wax paper and finish dipping and coating
all the pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Pour 1/4 inch of oil in a large, deepskillet and heat to about 350

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are a few reasons I like tuna packed in olive oil so much.
First, it's so moist. Second, it's so flavorful. And finally, it
comes in really big chunks--a nice complement to pasta or gnocchi.</LD>
<LD>   Look for jars of the big-chunk tuna at Italian markets, but you
can also use cans of tuna packed in oil, available at most markets.</LD>
<LD>   Serve the pasta with a loaf of rustic Italian bread and a bottle
of wine.</LD>
<TE>   And for dessert, whip a jar of lemon curd with some whipping
cream, then set out a big bowl of red, ripe strawberries for dipping.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tossed Tuna Pasta</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   If the olives aren't pitted, smash each olive with the flat side
of your knife. The pit will be easy to remove, and may even pop out.</TE>
<TE>   2 (6-ounce) jars tuna packed in olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives</TE>
<TE>   1 (6 1/2-ounce) jar artichoke hearts in water, drained</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons capers</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound pasta, such as medium shells or gnocchi</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</TE>
<TE>   Place the tuna and its oil in a large serving bowl. Gently break
up the tuna into bite-sized chunks.</TE>
<TE>   Slice the olives in half and add to the bowl. Slice the artichokes
in half lengthwise and add them to the bowl with the capers, lemon
juice and parsley. Set the mixture aside.</TE>
<TE>   Add salt to the boiling water, then the pasta, and cook until al
dente, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain. Add to the tuna mixture and toss well
to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</TE>

<LD>Whether steamed, grilled, stir-fried or sauteed, asparagus makes an
easy and attractive accompaniment to almost any entree. Buy extra for
a quick saute one night, then use the leftovers for asparagus risotto
another night.</LD>
<LD>   You'll need three bunches. Snap off the fibrous bottom end of each
spear. If the spears are thick, peel them from below the tip to the
base using a vegetable peeler. Cut the spears on the diagonal into
1-inch lengths. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and
1/2 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Swirl to coat the pan,
and cook the asparagus until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Reserve 2 cups for this risotto. To
garnish the saute, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top.</LD>
<LD>   Look in the rice and pasta aisle of well-stocked supermarkets for
Arborio rice. It is also available at specialty stores.</LD>

<TE>   Risotto With Asparagus</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   4 1/2 cups chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup finely chopped onion</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   2 cups inch-long cooked asparagus pieces</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Bring the chicken broth to a simmer in a small saucepan. Heat the
butter and oil in a 3 1/2- to 4-quart saucepan or Dutch oven over
medium heat. Swirl to coat the pan, and then add the onion and
garlic. Cook until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add the
rice and stir until the grains are well coated with oil, about 1
minute. Add the wine and let come to a boil.</TE>
<TE>   Add 1/2 cup of broth to the rice and cook, stirring frequently,
until the rice has almost completely absorbed the liquid. Adjust the
heat so the risotto is kept at a slow simmer. Repeat, adding 1/2 cup
of broth at a time. At about 18 minutes, the rice will be plump and
cooked through with a nice texture of individual grains. Add the
asparagus and any remaining broth, plus the cream and Parmesan. Stir
gently for 1 minute, allowing some of the liquid to be absorbed and
the asparagus to heat through. Add pepper to taste. Spoon the risotto
into warm flat bowls and serve immediately.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DEAR SOS: I've heard about "Irish potatoes" but I can't find them in
any store. Can you tell me what the characteristics of this kind of
potato are and where I can buy them? Thank you.</LD>
<LD>   MAJA UMBRICHT</LD>
<LD>   Via E-mail</LD>
<TE>   DEAR MAJA: Are you talking about Irish potato candies, also called
"Easter eggs"? Here's a recipe for them from the Web site
Allrecipes.com. If you're talking about an actual potato, we know
them as russet potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Grandmom's Irish Potatoes</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 35 minutes plus 30 minutes
cooling</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup evaporated milk</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   About 2 tablespoons minced walnuts, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Cocoa powder, optional</TE>
<TE>   Combine the sugar, butter, evaporated milk, cream of tartar and
salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix well and bring to a boil.
Cook until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, 234 degrees on a
candy thermometer, about 8 to 10 minutes. (A few drops will form a
soft ball when dropped into cold water.)</TE>
<TE>   Remove the mixture from the heat and cool to room temperature. Add
the vanilla and beat until creamy and stiff. Roll the mixture into
balls shaped like little potatoes, about 1 1/2 inches long. Roll each
ball in the cinnamon to coat, then press in pieces of nuts to look
like eyes. You can also dust the potatoes with cocoa to simulate
dirt.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DEAR SOS: Several years ago you published a lemon chiffon cake recipe
for Passover. It called for sifting cake flour and potato starch
several times and cooking down lemon juice. It might have been called
Carol's. It was excellent.</LD>
<LD>   VIVIAN RICE</LD>
<LD>   Palm Springs</LD>
<TE>   DEAR VIVIAN: Carol agrees--Carol Walter, that is, author of "Great
Cakes." In the April 1995 story she says: "Sponge cake and Passover
seem to go hand in hand, but I like to add a special dessert or two
to the traditional ones. My lemon chiffon cake is great at any time
of the year and everyone just loves it at Passover."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carole Walter's Passover Lemon Chiffon Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   4 teaspoons grated lemon zest</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup matzo cake meal</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup potato starch</TE>
<TE>   8 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   1 2/3 cups superfine sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup oil</TE>
<TE>   8 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the lemon juice and grated zest in a small saucepan. Bring
to a slow boil. Simmer 4 to 5 minutes. (There should be 6 tablespoons
of liquid. If not, add water.) Set aside to cool.</TE>
<TE>   Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift together the matzo cake meal and
potato starch 4 times. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Place the egg yolks and whole egg in the small bowl of an electric
mixer. Beat on medium speed until the mixture begins to thicken,
about 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and
continue beating until the mixture turns pale yellow and is very
thick. Scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally. Slowly add the oil
in a steady stream.</TE>
<TE>   Reduce the speed to medium-low. Add the cooled lemon juice and
zest and beat until blended. Reduce the speed to low. Gradually add
the sifted dry ingredients and mix until the batter is smooth.
Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Place the egg whites in the large bowl of a mixer. Using clean
beaters or the whip attachment, beat the whites on medium speed until
frothy. Add the salt. Increase the speed to medium-high and gradually
add the remaining 2/3 cup of sugar at the side of the bowl, beating
until soft peaks form.</TE>
<TE>   With a rubber spatula, fold 1/4 of the beaten whites into the yolk
mixture to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whites.</TE>
<TE>   Gently pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch angel food pan
with a removable bottom. Smooth the top. Bake in the lower 1/3 of the
oven until the cake is golden brown and springy to the touch, 45 to
50 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert the pan onto
a wire rack. Cool the cake completely in the pan. Turn the cake
upright and run a thin, sharp knife around the sides of the pan, then
around the center tube. Lift the cake by the center tube and remove
the ring. Run a knife under the cake to loosen the cake from the pan.
Invert the cake and remove the tube section.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer the cake to a platter. Store the cake at room temperature
under a glass dome or cover with foil up to 1 week.</TE>

<HD>Spring: The Green Season</HD>
<DH>It's a time of promise and reward, a time to celebrate the
freshness and delicacy of its unique ingredients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Easter has a special meaning for cooks. Of course, it's a day of
celebration, but it's also a signal of the changing of seasons, of
the shift from the hearty foods of the chilly months to the fresher
flavors to come. Spring is a time that mingles promise--the cold and
rain won't last forever--and reward--look at all the good stuff that
pops up in their wake.</LD>
<LD>   Spring is a season in between. Winter is stolid and serious, with
mashed root vegetables and hearty greens that are perfect
accompaniments to the big meat braises and roasts that dominate the
dinner table. Summer is raucous and spendthrift with its pleasures,
rich with big flavors and loud colors--the vibrant red of tomatoes
and peppers and the purple-into-black of eggplant.</LD>
<LD>   In the middle comes spring, a season of cautious optimism,
characterized by the pale greens of asparagus and artichokes and the
fresh, vegetal sweetness of peas and freshly dug potatoes.</LD>
<TE>   It's a time of transition for cooks as well. While winter cooking
is all process--long cooking and a conscious building of
flavors--most spring vegetables need only a little preparation, be it
blanching, roasting or steaming. But take it easy. Too much work and
you're going to cover up their delicate flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Main-dish salads are one solution. With a carefully constructed
salad, you can get the best of both worlds by combining simple
preparation and striking juxtaposition of tastes, textures and
colors. A great salad can be a complex and satisfying dish, even if
it only takes minimal cooking. What could be better to bring to the
table, for Easter or any other day?</TE>
<TE>   But as with anything so simple, the ingredients need to be
perfect. In spring, as in any other season, half of good cooking is
shopping. And good shopping means knowing how to choose good
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Artichokes: Almost all of the fresh artichokes eaten in the United
States come from California, and most of those come from the little
town of Castroville, just north of Monterey. When so much of a crop
is concentrated in so limited an area, weather becomes extremely
important. The great Salinas flood of 1995 effectively put two-thirds
of the artichoke fields in America under water. This year there was
nothing nearly so drastic. But a deep winter chill did frost the area
pretty badly.</TE>
<TE>   This is a good thing on a couple of counts. Frost damages the
outer leaves of the artichoke, turning them brown (growers call it
"bronzed") and softening them a little. Because of this, frosted
artichokes are almost always cheaper. But the damage does nothing to
spoil the quality of the vegetable. In fact, there are farmers who
insist that frosting concentrates the flavor. Better artichokes for
less money--what's so bad about that?</TE>
<TE>   Choose artichokes that are heavy for their size. Don't be put off
by blackening around the stems or leaves. Know how artichoke hearts
turn black after you've cleaned them and let them sit? The same thing
happens to any nicks incurred during picking and shipping. Just trim
any damage away.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans only eat artichokes prepared one way: steamed or
boiled whole. The best artichokes to use for this kind of dish are
the biggest ones you can find (some farmers call them "hubcaps"). But
there is a whole range of dishes that use cleaned and cut-up
artichokes. For these dishes, choose the smaller ones. Because almost
everyone else goes for the big guys, these will be cheaper too.</TE>
<TE>   Asparagus: The California asparagus harvest got off to a slow
start this spring because of the cold weather in the Salinas area and
in the Imperial Valley, where it is grown. But the recent heat has
gotten things up and running.</TE>
<TE>   Expect to see more and more asparagus in the markets this spring
as increased plantings over the last several years come into bearing.
Asparagus from newer fields tend to be thinner--the fat stalks come
from well-fed, mature plants. The choice between the two is largely
aesthetic. They taste the same and they are equally tender.</TE>
<TE>   The thin asparagus tend to work best when used in dishes, but
there is nothing like the big fat ones when they're simply steamed or
boiled and dressed with a little olive oil and lemon juice.</TE>
<TE>   When you're shopping for asparagus, check the tops and bottoms.
The tips should be tightly furled--if left on its own, asparagus
eventually will open like a fern. The bottoms should be moist. Good
shippers pack asparagus upright in crates that have a moist pad in
the bottom. Good stores will display them the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Fava beans: In the last five years, it seems fava beans have gone
from unheard-of to ubiquitous. But they are still primarily a
small-farmer crop. There is as yet no "fava bean industry," nor is it
likely that there ever will be. The fact is, fava beans may be
delicious, but they are the very devil to prepare. There may be no
more time-consuming vegetable in the world.</TE>
<TE>   First you have to shuck the beans from their pods, then you have
to blanch them, then you have to peel the thin pale skin that wraps
them. That has to be done for every bean. Though the process does
provide a mind-numbing kind of comfort, a mountain of pods winds up
as a paltry amount of beans. It takes 5 pounds to get a single cup.
Some friends recently served a salad of favas mixed with tiny cubes
of pecorino Romano, which was very pretty served in espresso cups.
And that's certainly one way around the volume issue.</TE>
<TE>   You'll mostly find fava beans at farmers markets or at Middle
Eastern markets. Pick pods that are stiff and that have not begun to
wilt. The very youngest beans, which do not need to be blanched and
peeled, will come from pods with no bean bumps. In a pinch, remember
that Trader Joe's has begun to carry shucked, already blanched fava
beans. You just need to peel them.</TE>
<TE>   Peas: If fava beans are labor-intensive, nothing could be simpler
than peas. You can eat them raw. Some types are best eaten raw.
English peas are the ones people are most familiar with, but usually
only in frozen or canned form. Fresh English peas are a revelation.
They do need to be shelled, but then a simple blanching is all the
cooking that's required. And you don't really need to shell them. Try
this: simply boil them--pod and all--in a little water with some
butter. Then season them liberally with salt. Eat them by putting the
whole pod in your mouth and pulling, scraping your teeth against the
outside of the hull and popping out the little peas inside. You'll
never taste a more intense, sweet green flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar snap and snow peas are a little frustrating for some cooks
for the simple reason that there's really no way to prepare them that
makes them taste any better than they do raw. Steaming, blanching,
stir-frying, even roasting, just makes them less green, less sweet.
Some things are best left alone.</TE>
<TE>   Potatoes: It might seem crazy to classify the potato as a seasonal
vegetable, but only if you've never had a new potato. "New" doesn't
refer to its size (small potatoes can be old too) and it doesn't
refer to a variety (new potatoes come in all varieties). "New" refers
to young potatoes that are sold and marketed with minimal storage.
You'll know new potatoes by their fragility; you can easily scrape
the skin with your fingers.</TE>
<TE>   And you'll know them by their flavor and texture. The best way to
prepare these potatoes is to steam them until they are just soft
through. Transfer them to a mixing bowl and add a chunk of good, cold
butter. Toss them together until the potatoes are slathered with the
butter, and then sprinkle them well with coarse salt. You'll never
taste anything better.</TE>
<TE>   New potatoes are showing up now from both principal California
growing areas--the southern San Joaquin Valley (near Edison) and the
Imperial Valley. The Imperial Valley harvest normally starts a bit
earlier, but it was delayed (and reduced) this year by cold weather.</TE>

<TE>   1 large clove garlic, cut in half</TE>
<TE>   4 rib lamb chops, bones frenched</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 2/3 cup olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup white balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced shallot</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon snipped chives</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   4 cups torn butter lettuce</TE>

<TE>   1 cup cooked fava beans</TE>
<TE>   Rub a cut clove of garlic over the surface of the lamb chops.
Drizzle them with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and rub it over the
surface of the lamb. Sprinkle the lamb with the herbes de Provence
and salt to taste and rub it into the lamb. Cover and let the lamb
stand while you prepare the remaining ingredients</TE>
<TE>   Whisk together the mustard, sugar and balsamic vinegar. Gradually
drizzle in the remaining 2/3 cup of olive oil, whisking to form an
emulsion. Stir in the shallot, 2 tablespoons of the mint, the chives
and salt and pepper to taste.</TE>

in a large bowl. Add the olives, fava beans and remaining 1/4 cup of
mint and toss to mix. Cover the greens and refrigerate until ready to
serve.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat the grill over medium-high heat or heat the
broiler. Grill or broil the lamb chops until crispy brown on the
outside and medium rare on the inside, three minutes a side or to 145
degrees on a meat thermometer.</TE>
<TE>   Add enough dressing to moisten the greens and toss until the
greens are evenly coated. Divide the greens onto plates and top each

<LD>You'll find excellent Thai barbecued chicken at the Thai Deli, a
bustling little place in a corner mall on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue,
just east of downtown Los Angeles. The chicken stands out because it
is cut into thin strips that can be barbecued while you wait, not
precooked and finished on the grill, as in restaurants that serve
large pieces such as legs and breasts. Orders come with a small
salad, lots of fried rice and containers of spicy-sweet Thai dipping
sauce. Although it has three small tables, the Thai Deli is primarily
a takeout place. To reduce waiting time, order by phone in advance.</LD>

<HD>Wine Lovers: Way Too Much Information</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most practical wine columns in the country is the one
Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher write in the Friday edition of the
Wall Street Journal. They offer levelheaded opinions and don't
indulge in reviewing wines the average big-city wine lover has no
chance of finding.</LD>
<LD>   But to go from their column and their first book, "The Wall Street
Journal Guide to Wine," to their new book, "Love by the Glass:
Tasting Notes From a Marriage" (Villard, New York, 2002), is a shock,
like going from a panel discussion to a soap opera. Over the years
they've often slipped little references to their life as a couple
into the column; here, at the urging of some of their readers, they
stretch out on the subject of themselves.</LD>
<LD>   As the subtitle promises, there are a lot of tasting notes here,
but they're mostly about wines that are unavailable today and often
wouldn't be very interesting even if they were. They're just what one
couple tasted as they were learning about wine, a three-decade
progress from sweet pop wines such as Lancers to French heavy hitters
to up-and-comers from around the world.</LD>
<TE>   This is basically not a wine book but the story of two people who
are cosmically smitten with each other. In 1976 Brecher designed a
goofy, infatuated caricature of Gaiter's face with balloon cheeks and
saucer-like eyes--it's reproduced on page 316--and over the years
he's given her countless presents with the "Dottie face" design
worked into them. Gaiter and Brecher have many sentimental
anniversaries, and she always toasts him, "To your face," and he
always replies, "To your bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this strikes you as adorable. Or maybe it strikes you as, in
the modern expression, "way too much information."</TE>
<TE>   They're also smitten with wine. To them, it's both a transcendent
experience and a complete lifestyle. They visit innumerable
vineyards. They mark the events of their lives by the wines they
drank (each chapter in the book is named for a wine). They believe
that countless children in the '60s and '70s were "conceived with
Lancers in their bloodstream," and they make sure to moisten the lips
of their daughters Media and Zoe with carefully chosen wines as soon
as they are born.</TE>
<TE>   They tell us of their health problems (scoliosis, pancreatic
cancer, a herniated disk, difficulty conceiving), but basically they
have beautiful lives. They're successful in their careers and live in
the same apartment house on Central Park West as various celebrities.
They're always meeting lovely people who recognize them as kindred
souls and give them special bottles of wine, saying things like
"Drink this and make love."</TE>
<TE>   And restaurants adore them: "Waiters thought our leisurely pace
and obvious enthusiasm were charming, and they let us linger for
hours." (Well, it could happen.)</TE>
<TE>   They're probably very nice people, if excessively certain that
everybody could love them as much as they love each other. So
altogether you've got to be happy for them. The only question is
whether you're $24.95 happy, or maybe whether you want to get their
other book instead.</TE>

<HD>75 Years of Wax Paper</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SYLVIA CARTER</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent years, wax paper has been moving lower and lower on the
grocery store shelves. Now, to my dismay, it has reached the very
bottom. I was worried that it would soon disappear entirely.</LD>
<LD>   So I am gladdened to know that Cut-Rite Wax Paper, which landed in
stores in 1927, the same year Charles Lindbergh landed in Paris after
his transatlantic flight, has issued a commemorative 75th anniversary
box.</LD>
<LD>   Much as I love wax paper, I have always wondered why it is not
called waxed paper.</LD>
<TE>   Pat Schweitzer, a senior home economist for the Reynolds Kitchens
(who, with Betty Morton, is on Reynolds television ads) set me
straight. She explained that the wax is infused into the tissue paper
all the way through; it is not just a coating. So wax is correct.</TE>
<TE>   Schweitzer remembers watching her mother roll pie crust dough
between two sheets of wax paper.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a child," Schweitzer said, "the distinctive rip and
crinkle of wax paper always signaled something delicious."</TE>
<TE>   Wax paper was the first product to include a serrated cutter bar,
patented for use with Cut-Rite. How smart was that? Now, almost
everything that comes on a roll has a cutter bar.</TE>
<TE>   I favor this paper not merely because it is old-fashioned, but
because I suspect (and I am not alone in this) that plastic wrap
interacts in an unsavory or even toxic way with some foods; the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has urged caution when microwaving food
in plastic wrap. (In fact, most plastic wrap melts at between 195 and
250 degrees, which gives one pause for thought.)</TE>
<TE>   Besides, plastic wrap has an infuriating way of getting tangled
and sticking to itself. You've been there, done that. Who, I ask,
needs it?</TE>
<TE>   Cut-Rite, the wrap de rigueur for lunch-box sandwiches, is plenty
good enough for me.</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few reasons to keep wax paper handy.</TE>
<TE>   * Cover food to be microwaved. You can tear off the exact amount
needed, and it won't sag into the food as paper towels do. Also,
paper towels may be made of recycled material and contain dyes, which
makes them questionable for use on food. Paper towels absorb
moisture, while wax paper helps keep food moist.</TE>
<TE>   * Shred cheese, sift flour and grate lemon zest onto wax paper
and, again, there's nothing to wash.</TE>
<TE>   * Place four strips of wax paper strategically on the edges of a
plate, put the first layer of a cake on top, and frost cake. After
frosting both layers, slide the paper out from under the edges of the
cake for a neat plate without dribbles of frosting.</TE>
<TE>   * Wax paper is the perfect no-stick surface for chocolate-dipped
foods.</TE>

<HD>A Rare California Riesling Milestone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty years is a good chunk of time by any standard. All the more
when it represents the kind of dedication and hard work it takes to
make a small agriculture-based business successful. That's why the
20th vintage is considered a real milestone for a small wine
producer.</LD>
<LD>   At this point few California wineries can claim 20 vintages. The
number will swell rapidly in the next few years, reflecting the wine
industry's explosive growth in the early 1980s. Right now, however,
California's 20-vintage club is pretty exclusive--especially for
Riesling producers.</LD>
<LD>   Most New World wine regions have embraced Riesling as part of the
European wine heritage, but it's never quite caught on in California.
Only a handful of West Coast producers (Greenwood Ridge, Trefethen,
Smith-Madrone, Stony Hill, Navarro and Firestone are the only ones
that come readily to mind) have made a long-term commitment to
Riesling.</LD>
<TE>   That's why it was a special--make that unique--occasion to sit
down with winemaker Allan Green in early March for a retrospective
vertical tasting of his Greenwood Ridge Vineyards Rieslings going
back to 1980. A 20-year vertical of California Rieslings from a
single vineyard is rare, if not unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   The first wine--the brilliant, golden '80--was a lovely example of
aged Riesling. The complex perfume mingled dried fruits such as
apricot with toasted nuts and honey, yet it was also remarkably
fresh, with brisk acidity and a long, radiant finish. I've never
tasted a California white wine so evolved yet youthful, not to say
delicious, two decades after the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went, wine after wine, right up to the yet-unreleased
2001. And as we tasted, Green told the story of Greenwood Ridge,
which in many ways is the story of the modern small-winery movement
in California's coastal valleys.</TE>
<TE>   The Green family bought an old homestead in the coastal mountains
of Mendocino County, on a forested ridge overlooking Anderson Valley,
in 1973. The previous owner, Anderson Valley vintner Tony Husch, had
planted a small vineyard of Cabernet, Merlot and Riesling in 1972.
But before his first crop came in, he decided to abandon grape
growing to concentrate on running Husch winery.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase made the Greens instant grape growers. Through the
1970s they sold their grapes to Husch and other wineries in the area.
Inevitably Allan caught the winemaking bug and in 1980 he inaugurated
the Greenwood Ridge label, featuring a stylized alligator head
inspired by the shape of a ridge just south of the property.</TE>
<TE>   The first wine out the door was an off-dry Riesling, all of 200
cases. "It was the only thing we had to sell for the first three
years," he says. "The Cabernet was still aging in barrels. So we got
a reputation as a Riesling winery right from the beginning. At that
time there was already good Gewurztraminer coming out of Anderson
Valley, so it seemed natural to keep making Riesling in the off-dry
style that Gewurztraminer had established."</TE>
<TE>   "Off-dry" means about 1.5% residual sugar, but the cool climate
and shallow clay soil gives grapes with such intensity and bold
acidity that the wines seem plump and luscious, rather than sweet.
Each year gives a slightly different rendition but, vintage after
vintage, the Greenwood Ridge Rieslings have fresh peach and apricot
perfume and clear Riesling flavors with a fine mineral quality at the
core.</TE>
<TE>   That mineral savor has increased as the vines have matured and
sent their roots deep into the rocky subsoil. Recent vintages,
particularly '99 and '00, show the kind of steely authority that
characterizes German Rieslings from the slate soils of the Mosel
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   When conditions are right for the sugar-concentrating mold
Botrytis cinerea (eight vintages to date), the winery makes
late-harvest Rieslings. Their combination of pure, sweet flavor and
succulent acidity puts them among California's finest dessert wines.
The '83 and '89 are still vibrant, with deep tea and honey flavors.
The '90 is still fresh beneath developing layers of honey and dried
fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Green made the wines himself until 1984, assisted by occasional
free advice from his friend Jed Steele, a prominent North Coast
winemaker. Then he hired Fred Scherrer as full-time winemaker. When
Scherrer moved to Dehlinger after the 1987 harvest, Green hired local
winemaker Van Williamson. In '93 Kendall-Jackson purchased Edmeades
Vineyards and hired Williamson away from Greenwood Ridge, and Green
resumed winemaking duties as of '94 vintage. The wines from each
period reflect the winemaker's style: Scherrer's structured and
elegant, Williamson's bold and powerful and Green's purely sensual.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood Ridge labels have reflected the region's viticultural
evolution. The 1980 and '81 Rieslings were bottled as Mendocino
County wines. From '82 through '89 the label simply said Mendocino, a
broad American Viticultural Area (AVA) that included Anderson Valley.
Then the origin was Anderson Valley from '90 until '97, when it
switched to the new Mendocino Ridge AVA. "For most people that
doesn't make much difference," Green notes. "But now, I could use any
of those four AVAs. I could bottle the same Riesling with four
labels, each with a different AVA. I wonder if anyone would notice?"</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood Ridge also produces an impressive roster of other
varietals, including Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet
Sauvignon and Zinfandel (from Fred Scherrer's vineyard in Alexander
Valley). Still, Green seems to be a typically laid-back guy--until
you start looking at all the other things he does besides making
wine. Then you might think he's been channeling Martha Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just that he worked as an award-winning graphic designer
while tending the vines and turned an abandoned cabin on the property
into a stylish house. There's more to it than that. In addition to
wine, Greenwood Ridge produces Eye of the Dragon olive oil and
chocolate. The chocolate package, designed by Green, won a 2000 Print
Magazine design award.</TE>
<TE>   His passions for art and music have been expressed in different
ways. As a DJ, his "Straight Ahead Rock 'n' Roll Show" was for 11
years one of the most popular shows on Anderson Valley radio station
KZYX-FM (he recently turned the slot over to another DJ).</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s he commissioned several musicians and painters
to interpret Greenwood Ridge wines. The mixed-media results have been
presented several times along with lavish meals in art galleries and
other venues, including Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   One of the components is an abstract painting called "White
Riesling" by Napa Valley artist Nancy Willis. Its swirl of green,
gold and off-red oils and pastels captures the fleeting sensual
essence of Riesling better than words.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and he plays baseball--with uniforms and everything--in a
nationwide league. He sponsors a team, the Greenwood Ridge Dragons.</TE>
<TE>   This year also marks the 20th vintage of another ongoing Greenwood
Ridge program, the California Wine Tasting Championships (July 27 and
28)--a unique event in which tasters compete to identify wines by
grape variety, region, vintage and producer. It includes music and
tastings of chocolate, cheese and olive oil. Green says it typically
draws around 500 "contestants, friends and spectators, groupies and
hangers-on."</TE>
<TE>   Green admits to being "slightly addicted" to his Riesling. "It
goes really well with basketball," he says. "You can watch basketball
playoffs for hours and go through a couple of bottles, with guacamole
and chips."</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>1999 Finca L'Argata Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This elegant Spanish red from the Tarragona appellation just south of
Barcelona has a finish that belies its relatively modest price tag.
Dry, austere, fascinating, made from Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon
blended with a little Carinyena (Carignane) and Garnatxa (Grenache),
it's quite a wine for the money. Finca L'Argata comes from the
200-year-old Joan d'Anguera estate, one of the first in Spain to
plant Syrah in the late '70s. It's now run by brothers Josep and Joan
d'Anguera, who are making a name for themselves with Finca L'Argata.
A wine and a winery to watch.</LD>

<DH>For children new to the United States, teachers find that

<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You will have to excuse Tomasa Galeana if she sticks out among her
classmates at Anaheim's Thomas Edison Elementary School. After all,
she's 39 years old.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican native has been attending class with her 11-year-old
son, Mario, a fourth-grader, for a good part of this semester in a
new program that officials hope will prove a model of integration for
recently arrived immigrant students.</LD>
<LD>   Parents in the program, called the English Academy, come
voluntarily as their schedules allow, either for the whole school day
or just part of it.</LD>
<TE>   An average of eight parents are in the classroom on any given day
along with 20 fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders, teacher Rhonda
Oglevie said. The parents act as security blankets for children who
feel intimidated by an unfamiliar culture and school.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates a home atmosphere," she said. "The kids become a lot
more engaging."</TE>
<TE>   Oglevie's class is devoted to students who have been in the
country typically for a year or less. They meet in a separate
classroom, and the curriculum stresses English learning.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not only the children who are getting an education.</TE>
<TE>   "It is nice to start school over," a smiling Galeana said recently
while helping her son with a class project on Native Americans. "I
don't know any English," she said in Spanish. "So I learn English and
help my son with his homework."</TE>
<TE>   According to the California Department of Education, more than
200,000 public school students statewide have been in the country for
three years or less.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have arrived most recently, school can be a daunting
place, educators say. Students must contend not only with language
barriers but with the cultural gap between them and schoolmates who
have lived in the country longer.</TE>
<TE>   Many districts offer special curricula, often in separate
classrooms, for such students. But the program at Edison Elementary
takes the concept one step further by adding parents to the
classroom. State education officials said they are not aware of other
schools with this type of parental involvement.</TE>
<TE>   By increasing parent participation in the classroom, Edison school
officials hope to improve children's learning at home as well.</TE>
<TE>   "The more English you have going on at home," said Principal
Debbie Schroeder, "the progress of the students will be enhanced
too."</TE>
<TE>   The pilot program began this semester and will be expanded next
year if it proves successful.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to learn a whole new culture and system when you
don't have the support," said Ana Nogales, a Santa Ana psychologist
and author who serves Spanish-speaking immigrants in Orange and Los
Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   Having parents in the classroom, Nogales said, gives the children
confidence to engage the unfamiliar school environment.</TE>
<TE>   "When [immigrant] parents attend [adult] English classes and take
their children along they serve as role models," Nogales said. "They
see their parents are making an effort too. Now, can you imagine if
they can bring their parents to their class? The benefits are
multiplied."</TE>
<TE>   Since Proposition 227 effectively ended bilingual education in the
state three years ago, most students who are not fluent in English
have been mainstreamed into regular classrooms in what are called
language immersion programs.</TE>
<TE>   But for recently arrived immigrants who lack the most basic
English skills and are struggling with cultural adjustments, that may
seem like a sink-or-swim proposition.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids weren't swimming," Oglevie said of her students. "They
need a strong foundation before they can move on."</TE>
<TE>   Galeana's son was one of those sinking. The shy boy was struggling
with his studies even before moving to Anaheim two years ago from Las
Tapas in the Mexican state of Guerrero, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   This semester he made a major breakthrough. He's learned how to
read in English, Oglevie said. "His mom being here made a huge
difference."</TE>
<TE>   For Galeana the program has been a godsend too, she said. "I've
learned some simple words I can use when I go to the market," the
Anaheim housewife said. "Like turkey sandwich."</TE>
<TE>   During class one recent morning, Galeana sat in front of a
computer with Mario as they put together a report on California's
first Native American tribes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where you put what they ate," Galeana said, tapping the
computer screen. She then carefully typed A-C-O-R-N. "What else?" she
asked him. "P-I-N-E," Mario spelled for his mother, referring to pine
nuts.</TE>
<TE>   Galeana has attended most days, often staying until school lets
out. On this particular day, she was the only parent in the class,
but Oglevie said parent attendance varies from day to day.</TE>
<TE>   After the computer workshop, Galeana and her little classmates
moved to another classroom for reading lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a tiny chair in the back, the mother mouthed the sounds
of her new language; "flooor, dooo, heeelp, willllll...."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, her 3-year-old son, Brian, who came along, wandered
around the room picking up chalk bits and otherwise keeping himself
busy.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a little worried at first that it might be disruptive,"
Oglevie said about allowing parents to bring their toddlers. "But it
actually creates a family environment. It is really comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   That comfort has increased the level of participation from the
students, Oglevie said. Once-withdrawn children are a lot more likely
to participate in class.</TE>
<TE>   Hands shot up when Oglevie asked for volunteers to tackle a new
sound or spell a word. Students vied for her attention and walked
confidently when called to the drawing board.</TE>
<TE>   That confidence builds in Mario as each day goes by, his mother
and teacher said. When asked what he liked best about having his
mother in the classroom, the boy displayed a hint of timidity and
then said proudly, "I help her with things she doesn't know."</TE>

<HD>Margaret Gamper, 94; Nurse, Early Advocate of Natural
Childbirth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret J. Gamper, a pioneer of modern natural childbirth, died
March 18 of heart failure at a hospice in Skokie, Ill. She was 94.</LD>
<LD>   The native of Janesville, Wis., ran away from home at 19 to attend
nursing school in Chicago. After earning her degree, Gamper worked as
a maternity surgical assistant in Chicago hospitals and had witnessed
dozens of births when one case in particular caught her attention.</LD>
<LD>   Gamper was attending a woman who was undergoing a caesarean
section when she noticed another woman in the throes of labor in an
adjacent delivery room. In the 1930s, most women were given
anesthesia before delivering a baby, but this woman had not been
anesthetized. Nonetheless, she "turned and grinned at me," Gamper
recalled in an interview. "She was relaxed and without pain. And she
had the joy of seeing her baby immediately at birth."</LD>
<TE>   Intrigued, Gamper began to study and teach the childbirth methods
of Grantley Dick-Read, a British doctor considered the founder of
modern natural childbirth. He believed that women who had someone
with them to explain the process of childbirth experienced less pain.</TE>
<TE>   Gamper gradually developed her own techniques, which became known
in the 1930s as the Gamper method. She focused on helping women use
the natural forces of childbirth to their advantage, teaching them a
normal, natural rate of deep abdominal breathing to get through a
contraction.</TE>
<TE>   The Gamper method differed from Lamaze, which was developed in the
1940s and put the expectant mother's breathing focus outside the
body.</TE>
<TE>   One of Gamper's students was Dr. Robert Bradley, who built on her
ideas and developed a wide following starting in the 1960s with his
concept of having expectant fathers in the delivery room.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, Gamper founded a child-care agency serving the Chicago
area that is now run by her daughter, Mary Jane Sellers.</TE>

<HD>Cesar Milstein, 74; Nobel Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Cesar Milstein, the 1984 Nobel Prize winner who created "magic
bullets," which revolutionized the pharmaceutical and diagnostics
industries, has died at 74.</LD>
<LD>   The Argentine expatriate, who spent most of his research career at
Cambridge University in England, died at Aldenbrooke's Hospital in
Cambridge Sunday. No cause of death was announced.</LD>
<LD>   In 1975, Milstein and postdoctoral fellow Georges J.F. Kohler
invented monoclonal antibodies, biological molecules with unique
power and precision. Monoclonal antibodies have the ability to seek
out and bind to specific chemicals, ranging from an enzyme in the
blood to a cell in a tumor. That ability can be used to measure the
concentration of a specific chemical in the bloodstream or carry a
cell-killing agent to tumor cells while ignoring other tissues.</LD>
<TE>   They are "a new, powerful biological tool for fighting human
disease," said William H. Rastetter, chief executive of IDEC
Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, one of many biotechnology companies
established in the last two decades to exploit the capabilities of
monoclonal antibodies. Their greatest impact will occur in cancer
therapy, he said, where their great specificity will "spare patients
the ravages of chemotherapy."</TE>
<TE>   Among the powerful new drugs based on monoclonal antibodies are
Rituxan, Herceptin and Zevalin to fight cancer, Orthoclone OKT3 and
Zenapax to block transplant rejection, ReoPro to prevent blood clots
in heart patients, and Remicade to combat rheumatoid arthritis and
Crohn's disease.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are literally thousands of diagnostic tests
being marketed that are based on monoclonal antibodies. Such tests
can identify levels of specific hormones in the bloodstream, bacteria
in foods, viruses in humans or pollutants in tap water.</TE>
<TE>   All of these have grown from a relatively simple idea of
Milstein's to manipulate the immune system.</TE>
<TE>   The human immune system--like that of other animals--can make at
least 2 million different antibodies, each of which binds to one
specific target. Scientists have long made antibodies for research
purposes by injecting biological molecules or other chemicals--the
targets--into mice and harvesting antibodies. But such harvests
provided only complex mixtures of antibodies, unsuitable for medical
uses.</TE>
<TE>   Milstein and Kohler, like many researchers, attempted to isolate
immune cells that produced only one antibody and grow them in the
laboratory to produce the antibody in large amounts. But despite
their best efforts, the cells would die after a few replications.</TE>
<TE>   Their inspiration was to take the antibody-producing immune cell
and fuse it with a tumor cell to make it immortal. The result, which
they called a hybridoma, was a cell that would replicate and grow
indefinitely in the laboratory and that would produce a single or
"monoclonal" antibody.</TE>
<TE>   The antibodies have a variety of uses. Because they are
antibodies, their binding is sufficient to trigger an immune response
on its own. But their cell-killing ability can be greatly enhanced by
attaching a toxin--such as ricin--or a radioactive atom to them to
increase lethality. Attaching a fluorescent chemical or other marker
molecule allows them to be used to measure quantities of specific
chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   The scientific community recognized the significance of Milstein
and Kohler's discovery virtually immediately. It was only nine years
later that they received their Nobels in medicine--an unusually rapid
recognition in the slow-moving world of science.</TE>
<TE>   And it was only two years later that Orthoclone OKT3, the first
monoclonal antibody drug, came on the market. But further progress
occurred more slowly, in part because the original monoclonal
antibodies were made in mice. Mouse monoclonal antibodies produced an
antibody reaction in humans, which limited their utility until
researchers found ways to deceive recipients' immune systems by
"humanizing" the drugs--replacing segments of the mouse protein with
their human analogs.</TE>
<TE>   There are now 11 such drugs approved by the Food and Drug
Administration and two more awaiting approval. Hundreds of others are
in earlier stages of animal and human testing.</TE>
<TE>   Milstein was born in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, on Oct. 8, 1927, the
son of an itinerant Jewish immigrant. His mother, the daughter of a
poor immigrant family, was a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Milstein received his doctoral degree at the University of Buenos
Aires. After postgraduate work at Cambridge, he returned to a faculty
position at the National Institute of Microbiology in Buenos Aires.
But disheartened by anti-intellectualism and the firing of many
colleagues after a military coup, he returned to Cambridge, where he
spent the rest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife Celia. They had no children.</TE>

<LD>When one politician takes the stage to accuse another of the sin of
"playing politics," you can guess the nature of the trouble. The
accuser has run out of better excuses. And the accused is surely
making gains. It's like the guy blaming his hangover on the success
of the bartender.</LD>
<LD>   Which brings us to the Democrats' radio address to the nation last
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Three months into this election year, and the loyal opposition has
gone round on a bender. That's sometimes the last recourse when
things get unbearable, which may, in fact, explain matters here.</LD>
<TE>   Middle-school civics: The president of the United States is
playing politics to one degree or another with every breath he draws,
with every trip and deed. That's why we call him a politician. Blah
blah.</TE>
<TE>   But when does the fact warrant an accusation?</TE>
<TE>   Well, you don't do it when the president is traveling through the
Americas and you're feeling petulant because he is a Republican and
might be crowd-pleasing with voters who just happen to be in your hip
pocket where they belong, or so you think.</TE>
<TE>   But so muddled are the Democrats and so stubborn their insistence
on group loyalty that Antonio Villaraigosa could not resist a sloppy
punch when the party handed him the microphone Saturday: "The
president's trip this weekend to Latin America is part of an
orchestrated strategy to curry favor with Latino voters."</TE>
<TE>   (A) Perhaps, and (B) just what's wrong with that?</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be a better question to ask: Is it a good idea for the
president of the United States to travel south? To shake hands with
the heads of states in our own hemisphere? To hash out the neighborly
things we share such as economic investment, immigration and the
criminal fallout of the drug trade, as well as reestablishing the
Peace Corps in Peru?</TE>
<TE>   Or you can ask it this way: You mean George W. Bush should ignore
Mexico, Central and South America? As Villaraigosa, the onetime state
legislative leader and defeated candidate for mayor of Los Angeles,
put it: "The Republican pursuit of Hispanic voters is a calculated
political strategy. For us, it's an extension of our values."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not Latino, except to the extent that we all are shaped by the
cultures around us. But I do know the feeling of being left out by
our government. I'd be happier to see the president toss off old
ideology and curry more favor, cross more boundaries, speak more
languages, play more consensus politics across the whole field of our
national disagreements.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, for instance, how much better we would feel to read that
the administration had courted environmentalists in drafting the
president's energy proposals.</TE>
<TE>   I should emphasize that Villaraigosa's speech, posted on the party
Web site at www.Democrats.org, makes no criticism, substantive or
otherwise, of what Bush said to whom or where, merely that he went.
Sounds to me like the ethnic-politics card in a low denomination, a
sure sign of the opposition's rapid delamination.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats' righteousness of the winter of 2000 seems rather
quaint at the moment, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   In recent months they have let slip from their grasp the high
ground on Social Security surpluses and budget deficits. They fell on
their faces on the only forward-looking environmental initiative of
late, automobile mileage standards. They have failed to rouse
themselves behind health care, even as the problems grow more
alarming.</TE>
<TE>   They let themselves get skillfully blindsided by a president who
put union steelworkers ahead of global trade doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   Their pockets got picked cleanly when it comes to calling us
together for community service and volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   Now it looks as if they're going to be left on the sidelines while
the administration finally tears into tax cheats.</TE>
<TE>   If the Democrats have found the unified voice to counter the
free-market-at-any-cost maniacs after Enron, we haven't heard it on
this side of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Am I off base or doesn't it seem that the most interesting
challenge to the Republican status quo is being posed these days by a
Republican senator from Arizona? I guess the Democrats are laying
low, scared maybe that somebody will accuse them of playing politics.</TE>
<TE>   By the way: In Sunday's column about what's in the name of Arthur
Andersen, I got one wrong. It's Edgar Allan Poe, not Allen.</TE>

<HD>Today's Boom Cars Are Nothing If Not Acoustic Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED RUETER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A crew in Phoenix has been customizing "the Beast," a Ford Bronco
with a car stereo designed to pump out a whopping 175 decibels,
reports Wired magazine. The Bronco's 48,000-watt system would be
eight times louder than a 747 jet.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood Sound Labs, a manufacturer of car stereos, brags that
its equipment can "shake seats and annoy neighbors." Prestige Stereo
boasts that its four-channel 120-watt amp will "put the over-40 set
into cardiac arrest." Lightning Audio gloats that its products "make
you bleed," and Sony's slogan for its Xplod speakers is "disturb the
peace."</LD>
<LD>   Well, there is no peace when a boom car is around. These brutal,
excruciatingly loud cars with powerful booming bass can be heard for
more than a mile. They can shake your windows and furniture. And they
are an increasing element in American life. At the recent
International Sound Off in Kansas City--where cars and drivers
competed for the highest volume--one boom car owner conceded that he
doesn't listen to his own system much because "I'd go deaf."</LD>
<TE>   He's probably right. Boom car noise is physically dangerous.
Besides the obvious hearing problems, the American Psychiatric Assn.
reports that noise is related to chronic fatigue syndrome. The
Environmental Protection Agency has long recognized noise as a risk
factor for heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Boom cars are a public safety hazard as well. They increase the
chance of accidents by distracting motorists and making it more
difficult for drivers to hear emergency sirens. In addition, these
instruments of auditory assault encourage the worst elements of
sexist behavior and hypermasculinity: the desire for domination,
feelings of aggression and belligerence toward society.</TE>
<TE>   The acoustic terrorism fostered by boom cars runs counter to the
desire of most Americans for peace and quiet. The Census Bureau notes
that noise is Americans' No. 1 complaint about their neighborhoods.
Noise levels have risen sixfold in major U.S. cities in the past 15
years, and automobiles are the largest source of noise.</TE>
<TE>   Peace-loving citizens need to reclaim the streets. Some have
already begun: In Chicago, boom cars that can be heard from 75 feet
are subject to seizure and their owners may be fined $615. Buffalo,
Cleveland and Pittsburgh also are cracking down on boom cars. In
Papillion, Neb., owners of car stereos that can be heard from 50 feet
away can earn themselves three months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Besides petitioning their local officials to enact similar laws,
there are other things that people can do to save their hearing and
their sanity. Auto stereo manufacturers should be pressured to stop
glorifying audio violence. Companies that gloat about disturbing the
peace should hear from angry consumers. Police carrying decibel
meters and driving with their windows down should be on the lookout
for noise violators. And the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration should place restrictions on how much noise can be
generated by car stereo equipment.</TE>
<TE>   It's time, in other words, for a little peace on Earth.</TE>

<HD>A Simple Mideast Plan With Huge Implications</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIBLEY TELHAMI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Arab summit convening today in Beirut comes at a critical
juncture. Either a new path to peace will be found that will
stabilize the state system that has been in place for the past half a
century or a serious military escalation on the Palestinian-Israeli
front will throw the region into new turmoil.</LD>
<LD>   On the summit agenda is a seemingly simple plan: Arab endorsement
of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's proposal to offer normal relations
between Israel and other Arab states in exchange for Israeli
withdrawal from the territories it seized in the 1967 Middle East
War, including the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights.</LD>
<LD>   While the plan had the support of most Arab governments even
before the summit convened, the people of the region remain highly
suspicious.</LD>
<TE>   Local commentators and opposition leaders have called Abdullah's
proposal--and the American support for it--a conspiracy to kill the
Palestinian intifada, which some believe is the Palestinians' only
hope to compel Israeli withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Adding fuel to the simmering public sentiment has been the way
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dealt with the issue of whether
to allow Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to attend the
summit.</TE>
<TE>   Although Arafat on Tuesday declined to attend, Arab commentators
fumed that keeping Arab leaders waiting for an Israeli decision on
Arafat was humiliating.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many in the region, especially governments and the elites
around them, view the Saudi plan as an opportunity to show the world
and the Israeli public that the Arabs are ready to accept Israel and
live in peace--if Israel withdraws from Arab territory.</TE>
<TE>   The signal of acceptance from an important Muslim state came at a
time when many Israelis are suspicious of Arab intentions. For the
U.S., the Saudi initiative opened up a new avenue for diplomacy when
the Bush administration seemed to have no answer for halting the
escalating violence.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. encouragement of Arab support for the Saudi
initiative--and the Arab public's interpretation that the summit
reflects "American pressure"--has its own risks.</TE>
<TE>   Any summit resolution roughly endorsing the Saudi initiative would
not constitute a plan that would allow immediate return to the
negotiating table. The Arab public, however, would interpret such a
resolution as a major gesture of peace when, instead, many want to
see support for the intifada.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis are likely to reject the notion of full withdrawal. And
the conflict is likely to breed more violence even if U.S. special
envoy Anthony C. Zinni succeeds in achieving a cease-fire for a short
while. The parties in the region will inevitably conclude that the
ball will be in the American court, and expectations will be high.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration would then have to make a critical
decision: It would have to put forth its own peace plan and elevate
its level of involvement in the region beyond what it has been
inclined to do, or it would have to risk losing much Arab
cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   If the aim of recent American diplomacy, including the mission of
Zinni and the tour by Vice President Dick Cheney, is to lay the
ground for future Arab cooperation in a possible confrontation with
Iraq, then such cooperation will become less likely if the
administration fails to deliver on the Arab-Israeli peace front.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is a risk worth taking. What happens on the
Palestinian-Israeli front is likely to affect the future of regional
politics beyond the issue of Iraq. The Beirut summit brings to mind
another important Arab summit that was held in Rabat, Morocco, in
1974. The issue at the time was also Arafat and his Palestine
Liberation Organization.</TE>
<TE>   For years many Arab leaders, including Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser
and Jordan's King Hussein, claimed to represent the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   It was Saudi Arabian King Faisal whose speech at the Rabat summit
ended the debate. The PLO was accepted as the "sole, legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   That resolution was not simply a victory for Arafat; it signaled
an end to pan-Arabism as well as the normalization of the state
system in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   As the Palestinians were seen to represent themselves in a drive
to establish their own state, other Arab states were freed to pursue
their own independent policies. This has been the logic of the Arab
system ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the possible unraveling of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
project--and with it Arafat and the Palestinian Authority--could have
significant ramifications for states across the Mideast.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is encouraging to read a joint appeal for peace signed by both an
Arab American and a Jewish American ("The Only Hope for Peace," by
George Salem and Marvin Lender, Opinion, March 24). It is more
constructive to pave the way toward peace than to debate which side
is more to blame for the calamity. The war of mutual destruction has
gone on long enough and does not serve either side.</LD>
<LD>   It would be even more encouraging to read a similar joint appeal
by Palestinians and Israelis to their respective constituencies.
There are similar voices in Israel, politicians like Shimon Peres and
Yossi Sarid, intellectuals like Amos Oz and Uri Avneri, and many
others--like the soldiers refusing service in the territories. They
can be freely heard in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Where are similar voices on the Palestinian side? All we hear from
there is that Hamas and Islamic Jihad will not feel bound by any
cease-fire agreement.</LD>
<TE>   A joint resolution by peace-loving Palestinians and Israelis would
add strength to U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni's efforts to achieve a
reasonable compromise and peace. Without it, his endeavor faces an
uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Fiderer</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At least Israelis can feel safe in their homes, a luxury not
afforded to Palestinians whose dwellings are repeatedly raided or
leveled by the Israeli Defense Forces. Such inflictions only help to
breed the desperation and resentment behind suicide acts. Israel
could choose to trade its expansionary settlement policy into
Palestinian territories for homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   Marwan Saab</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All the letters and commentary pieces ignore one basic fact. The
only difference between Palestinian terrorists and other terrorists
is that these terrorists are killing Jews. No other similar group has
received so much aid and recognition. No other country has had to
tolerate what Israel has to tolerate.</TE>
<TE>   The world is full of Arab lands, much of it empty. But it is
Israel that has to trade land for peace. And maybe not a peace at
all.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Gafni</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I believe the bells are beginning to toll for Israel as a state or
nation. It can't survive under present world circumstances, and there
probably will be a new exodus in the near future. The land means
nothing to Yasser Arafat or the Palestinians. Their only meaning is
venomous hatred toward the "Jew," any Jew. While the Bush
administration is off cleaning spider webs in Afghanistan, Pakistan
and wherever, the spiders are still spinning the real web of hatred
for the Jew and the United States. "Mein Kampf" has a new author.</TE>

<LD>Michael Ramirez's cartoon (Commentary, March 21) of Arthur Andersen
being shredded is missing one thing--a "Property of the Department of
Justice" label on the shredder. Despite Andersen's attempts to reform
the auditing regulations and resolve its own issues, Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft's indictment has landed a leveling blow to the once-proud
accounting firm.</LD>
<LD>   The Republicans' attempt to bury "Enrongate" by allowing Enron to
burn itself out and destroying Andersen is downright cruel to the
workers who will lose their jobs. Shame on Congress for turning a
blind eye to the thousands of working innocent affected by this mess.</LD>

<HD>Charges Against Former Waste Execs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>A Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The central government allegation against former Waste Management
Inc. executives is that they manipulated the company's financial
results from 1992 to 1997 to meet preset earnings targets--thereby
helping to boost the company's stock price and thus the value of the
executives' stock options.</LD>
<LD>   The case doesn't involve the kind of off-balance-sheet
partnerships that Enron Corp. used to hide debt and make its finances
appear stronger than they were.</LD>
<LD>   But as in the Enron case, the former Waste Management executives
are alleged to have used phony accounting to enhance the company's
balance sheet and income statement.</LD>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission contends that the Waste
Management officers:</TE>
<TE>   * Assigned arbitrary salvage values to assets that previously had
no salvage value.</TE>
<TE>   * Failed to record expenses for declines in the value of landfills
as they were filled with waste.</TE>
<TE>   * Refused to record expenses necessary to write off the costs of
abandoned landfill development projects.</TE>
<TE>   * Established inflated environmental reserves in connection with
acquisitions, so that the excess reserves could be used to avoid
recording unrelated operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The terms for the alleged accounting manipulations are "netting"
and "geography," the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   "Defendants allegedly used netting to eliminate approximately $490
million in current-period operating expenses and accumulated
prior-period accounting misstatements by offsetting them against
unrelated one-time gains on the sale or exchange of assets," the SEC
said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the executives "are charged with using geography
entries to move tens of millions of dollars between various line
items on the company's income statement" to make the firm's financial
results appear more robust.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleges that the executives' conduct "was driven by greed
and a desire to retain their corporate positions and status in the
business and social communities," said Thomas C. Newkirk, SEC
associate enforcement director.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, former Waste Management chairman Dean
L. Buntrock, 70, was "the driving force behind the fraud. He set
earnings targets, fostered a culture of fraudulent accounting,
personally directed certain of the accounting changes to make the
targeted earnings, and was the spokesperson who announced the
company's phony numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Buntrock "presented himself as a pillar of the community," making
charitable contributions with allegedly ill-gotten gains, the SEC
said.</TE>
<TE>   Buntrock denies the SEC's charges.</TE>

<HD>IRS Hits Offshore Account Industry</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Agency could batter the thriving business by
prosecuting a few cases, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The IRS' crackdown on offshore accounts is a serious blow to a
booming--if questionable--industry that promotes such schemes as a
way to hide income and evade creditors, tax experts said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Touted on Web sites, in hotel seminars and in conference rooms of
well-known banks, offshore trusts have helped as many as 2million
Americans illegally underreport their incomes, the IRS says.</LD>
<LD>   The agency hopes to find many of those scofflaws by demanding
credit card records to track financial transactions linked to
offshore accounts. MasterCard International Inc. has turned over 1.7
million records, and American Express Co. said Monday that it would
comply with the IRS' request for similar information. In addition,
the Justice Department has asked a federal court in San Francisco to
have Visa International disclose offshore credit card accounts.</LD>
<TE>   Although the IRS probably won't audit everyone who has set up a
questionable offshore trust, tax experts said, the agency will
prosecute enough high-profile cases to discourage other taxpayers
from using the accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of the IRS criminal division is deterrence," said
Beverly Hills tax attorney Charles Rettig. "The IRS prosecutes a few
cases, they get some publicity, and everybody else falls in line."</TE>
<TE>   The tactics are similar to those the IRS has used to discourage
tax protesters who argue that income taxes are illegal or that only
income from foreign sources may be taxed. Courts repeatedly have
rejected such arguments as frivolous and jailed and fined proponents.</TE>
<TE>   The offshore arrangements the IRS is targeting can have a
legitimate purpose in helping individuals protect their assets from
lawsuits, said accountant Andy Mattson, an expert in international
taxation.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were a brain surgeon, I would want to have at least some of
my assets in an asset protection trust located in a country that has
rules to protect it from creditors," Mattson said. "The problem is
[these trusts] have been bastardized into something for tax evasion."</TE>
<TE>   The trusts were first promoted to the wealthy for $25,000 to
$70,000 in set-up fees and annual costs of $3,000 to $20,000 to
administer. In the last three to four years, however, promoters have
begun touting much cheaper versions for $3,500 or so to consumers,
tax experts said.</TE>
<TE>   These promoters emphasize how the arrangements can be used to hide
income. U.S. residents are encouraged to deposit money in a bank in a
tax-haven country. A depositor then can use a credit or debit card
linked to the account to pay expenses.</TE>
<TE>   These transactions don't leave a paper trail, because no bank or
credit card statements are mailed to the U.S. resident. If a debit
card is used, the money simply is deducted from the account. If a
credit card is used, the bank or an advisor pays the bills.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing illegal about such arrangements if the U.S.
resident discloses the account on tax returns and doesn't use it to
hide income, said Bill Norman, a tax attorney and asset protection
expert in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 200,000 people acknowledged having such accounts on
their 2000 tax returns, however, and the IRS believes many of the
arrangements are designed specifically to evade taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The penalties for failing to report offshore arrangements are
hefty. Taxpayers can face a civil fraud penalty equal to 75% of the
tax assessed by an auditor, Rettig said. If the IRS decides to press
criminal charges, which it can do if the tax bill is more than
$40,000, taxpayers could face 10 months or more in a federal prison,
he said.</TE>

<LD>Delinquent credit card bills rose in the fourth quarter while late
payments on auto and consumer loans declined, the American Bankers
Assn. said. The trade group said 3.88% of credit card holders were
late making payments by 30 days or more in the October-December
period, up from 3.77% in the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The dollar amount of credit card delinquencies rose to 4.67% of
outstanding balances from 4.45% in the July-September period. The
trend was opposite for closed-end installment loans for cars, home
improvements and personal items such as vacations. Delinquencies for
those loans fell to 2.34% in the fourth quarter from 2.40% in the
third.</LD>

<LD>Calabasas-based Right Start Inc. will change its name to FAO Inc. and
move to King of Prussia, Pa., the company's shareholders decided at a

<LD>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. President Takashi Sonobe said he will propose
top management changes today to speed up a turnaround at the ailing
auto maker, setting off speculation that he may step down.</LD>
<LD>   Tokyo-based Mitsubishi, which is 37.3% owned by DaimlerChrysler of
Germany, has been trying to boost its plunging sales in Japan and
repair its battered image in the wake of a defect cover-up in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Sonobe took over as Mitsubishi Motors president in November 2000
after his predecessor resigned to take responsibility for the
scandal. The announcement set off speculation that he will step down
and hand over his post to Chief Operating Officer Rolf Eckrodt.</LD>

<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed fining Boeing Co.
nearly $350,000 for allegedly failing to maintain certain quality
controls, mostly in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   The FAA accused the company's Seattle-based commercial airplane
division of violating regulations on four occasions.</LD>

that the alleged problems did not result in flight safety risks. The
FAA said Boeing worked to identify and correct the problems when they
were discovered.</LD>

<LD>McDonald's Corp.'s decision to extend the tenure of its chief
executive for three more years is a signal that management continuity
is more important to the company than concerns about its weak
near-term outlook, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The extension of Jack Greenberg's position comes as the world's
biggest chain restaurant operator faces growing impatience from Wall
Street and investors to deliver improved results this year, after
reporting five straight quarters of earnings declines.</LD>

<LD>A key Aladdin hotel-casino creditor is objecting to a proposal to
sell the bankrupt Las Vegas Strip property. General Electric Capital
Corp., the resort's equipment lease financier, has asked a U.S.
bankruptcy judge to stop the court-supervised sale.</LD>
<LD>   GE Capital's 20-page filing cited newspaper reports that Aladdin
executives are "contemplating a sale to a specific buyer on terms
which do not appear to provide for satisfaction of creditors'
claims," including those of GE Capital. A hearing on the objection is
scheduled April 4.</LD>

<LD>British Unveil Plans to Loosen Gambling The British government
unveiled plans to free gambling from decades-old regulations, a
change supporters hope and detractors fear will bring glitzy Las
Vegas-style casinos to dowdy British seaside resorts. Under Britain's
1968 Gaming Act, casinos operate as private clubs and cannot provide
live entertainment or serve alcohol at gambling tables. Jackpots are
limited, and gamblers must apply for membership 24 hours before they
enter a casino. However, those provisions would be scrapped under the
new proposals as would rules banning most casino advertising.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Software products that claim to stop personal computers from
accessing pornographic sites on the World Wide Web are doomed to
fail, a computer language expert testified in a case challenging a
federal effort to require libraries to install filtering software on
computers.</LD>
<LD>   At the trial, which is looking at how far the U.S. government can
go to prevent children from exposure to pornography on library
computers, Stanford University linguist Geoffrey Nunberg testified
that the crude mathematical methods used to operate filtering
software are simply no match for the subtleties of human judgment.</LD>
<LD>   A special three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court is
presiding over the constitutional case, which was brought by a
coalition of libraries, library patrons and Web site operators hoping
to overturn the Children's Internet Protection Act with a free-speech
challenge.</LD>

company return to profitability, although it gave no timetable for
that. Ciena President and Chief Executive Gary Smith said the company
had to adjust to the weak market. Ciena's stock rose 5 cents to close
at $8.40 in heavy Nasdaq trading.</LD>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co., the second-largest computer maker, expects to
complete the proposed $19.6-billion purchase of Compaq Computer Corp.
in April or May, the companies said in a memo to employees. "We are
on target to reach this goal," Hewlett-Packard integration team
leader Webb McKinney and his Compaq counterpart, Jeff Clarke, said.
About 1,200 workers are on the integration team, up from 900 a week
ago, the memo said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer groups and competitors of companies that sell high-speed
Internet service over cable modems are asking the courts to throw out
a decision by federal regulators leaving that business largely
unregulated.</LD>
<LD>   Telephone company Verizon Communications filed suit against the
Federal Communications Commission on Monday in a U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington. Verizon transmits over telephone wires a form
of high-speed Internet service, known as digital subscriber line
service, that competes with cable.</LD>
<LD>   The Media Access Project also challenged the FCC's ruling on
Monday, on behalf of three consumer groups. EarthLink Inc., an
independent Internet service provider, filed its suit Friday. An FCC
spokesman said the agency would have no comment. The FCC ruled March
14 that cable Internet companies are information providers rather
than telecommunications providers.</LD>

the number of people uneasy about online shopping up for the first

Internet Confidence Index showed.</LD>
<LD>   Even as a separate study showed overall consumer confidence rose
this month, the index compiled by Internet media company Yahoo Inc.
and market research company ACNielsen, showed consumer confidence in
the Internet fell four points during the first quarter. The companies
said the drop reflected less confidence in fulfillment of online

<HD>Shell to Propose Baja Gas Project</HD>
<DH>Energy: Firm would be fourth to offer a plan for a
$500-million terminal just south of the border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>If oil companies have their way, a short stretch of Baja California
coastline immediately south of the U.S. border could someday be the
scene of about $2 billion in energy projects.</LD>
<LD>   The latest proposal is to be formally unveiled today by a unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group that wants to build a $500-million liquid
natural gas terminal, a re-gasification facility and a pipeline at a
site believed to be about 60 miles south of the border.</LD>
<LD>   The Shell project would be the fourth LNG proposal for the area,
which is favored for its proximity to several natural-gas-fed power
plants under construction or planned in Baja. Closeness to Southern
California is another plus, because each company wants to sell
surplus gas there.</LD>
<TE>   Jon Chadwick, director of Shell Gas and Power, said the company
was considering an inland route for the 55-mile pipeline. That would
accommodate the Baja government, which prefers routing the gas
through undeveloped areas, thereby promoting new sources of energy
and business opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The three other gas projects have been pitched by El Paso Corp.,
Marathon Oil Corp. and Sempra Energy. Each involves building piers
half a mile or more in length out into the Pacific, where ships
bringing supercooled liquid gas from Asia and Latin America would tie
up and unload. The liquid would be stored in large silos, then turned
back into gas for transmission via a pipeline to users in Baja
California and, via another pipeline network, to the Western United
States. Each project would cost about $500 million and take three
years to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Except for one facility in Alaska that sends liquid natural gas to
Japan, no major LNG projects are currently in operation on the
Pacific coast of North America.</TE>
<TE>   The likelihood that all four proposals would be built is
considered small, but the market could absorb the supply from at
least two of the projects easily, observers have said.</TE>
<TE>   Shell's project, which could send out as much as 1.3 billion cubic
feet of gas a day, is the largest. Shell's maximum output is enough
gas to power about 15 medium-sized electric power plants.
ChevronTexaco Corp. is known to be scouting Baja for a fifth LNG
project proposal.</TE>
<TE>   For competitive reasons, each energy company would like to be the
first to start construction, all eyeing a 2005 completion. But the
companies are awaiting permit application procedures to be completed
by Mexican federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Political maneuvering already has begun, and each project is
believed to have advantages and disadvantages in the race for permit
approval. Given the likely opposition from residents and
environmentalists, each is marshaling local and national political
support.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Rosarito has refused to grant El Paso Corp. a land-use
permit for its project, adjacent to an existing power plant. Last
week the governor of Baja California, Eugenio Elorduy Walther, made
what some interpreted as negative remarks about the El Paso project
in Rosarito, telling a radio reporter: "I don't believe the mayor of
Rosarito would like it if they put a gas plant in his backyard."</TE>

<HD>Community Bank's Plan Rejected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday rejected the Los Angeles
Community Development Bank's annual business plan, sparking a
last-ditch round of negotiations to remake the troubled institution.</LD>
<LD>   The council action triggers 60 days of formal talks between the
federally funded bank and the city, which oversees it. The city staff
then has 30 days to report back to the council.</LD>
<LD>   The business plan lays out the budget for the quasi-private bank,
which cannot operate without city approval. The bank was created in
the aftermath of the 1992 riots to revitalize business in the city's
poorest pockets, but has fallen short of its mandate to create jobs
for local residents.</LD>
<TE>   The council voted without discussion to reject the plan. City
officials said in a report that the bank's plan didn't do enough to
correct the jobs problem. The report also said the plan did not
address a funding shortfall that has crippled the bank's ability to
lend.</TE>
<TE>   The council action Tuesday funded the bank for 90 days, allowing
it to operate while its future is determined. If negotiations fail,
the city will have the option of taking over or shutting down the
bank.</TE>
<TE>   But bank Chief Executive William Chu said he is optimistic a deal
can be struck to keep the bank operating.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a chance for the bank to formally sit down with the
city," he said. "It does not necessarily mean that it's the end of
the road."</TE>

<HD>Abbott, Novartis Accused of Collusion in Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abbott Laboratories and a unit of Novartis are accused in a
health-maintenance organization's lawsuit of conspiring to keep a
generic version of the high-blood pressure drug Hytrin off the
market.</LD>
<LD>   The suit by Oakland-based Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. comes
two years after Novartis' U.S. generic-drug unit, Geneva
Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Abbott agreed to settle Federal Trade
Commission claims of collusion over Hytrin. The hypertension and
prostate drug has annual sales of about $700 million for Abbott.</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,
accuses the two companies of unfair competition and restraint of
trade. It seeks unspecified triple damages and disgorgement of
profits.</LD>
<TE>   "By unlawfully extending Abbott's patent monopoly, defendants'
conduct cost Kaiser and other purchasers hundreds of millions of
dollars in savings" had the generic version of Hytrin been made
available in 1996 instead of 1999, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., did not
immediately return a call seeking comment. Officials of Broomfield,
Colo.-based Geneva declined to comment, saying they had not seen the
suit. Switzerland-based Novartis is Europe's third-largest drug
maker.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott's shares rose 43 cents to $52.84 Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Abbott filed a patent-infringement suit against
Geneva in 1995 after Geneva notified the Food and Drug Administration
of its intent to sell a generic version of Hytrin. Abbott later
agreed to pay Geneva "millions of dollars" to delay the release of
its low-price alternative drug, the suit claims.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones News Service</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc. plunged 68% on Tuesday after it
said data from its study of treatment of patients with bleeding in
the eye failed to show statistically significant improvement.</LD>
<LD>   Ista said data from its Phase III studies of a single injection of
Vitrase for treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage, or bleeding
inside the eye, didn't meet its primary goals.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the Irvine company was downgraded to a "hold" from
"strong buy" by CIBC World Markets. Ista shares closed at 91 cents,
down $1.92, on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   Though Ista didn't achieve its primary goal, it noted "clinically
relevant" improvements in patients' ability to read an eye chart
several months after receiving the Vitrase injection. The primary
goal of the study was to clear the hemorrhage enough to allow further
diagnosis or treatment. But Ista didn't achieve a statistically
significant improvement in that category.</TE>
<TE>   The only current treatment available for vitreous hemorrhage is
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   About 450,000 cases of vitreous hemorrhage occur each year in the
United States, and the company said about half of those cases would
be candidates for treatment with Vitrase.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it had no comment on Tuesday's sharp drop in its

<HD>Jack in the Box Says Estimates on Target</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: The chain is cutting expenses as
second-quarter sales may be less than expected on sluggish demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack in the Box Inc. said second-quarter and annual profit will meet
the company's estimates as the hamburger-restaurant chain reduces
costs.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings will be 44 cents a share in the quarter ending April 14
and $2.24 this year, spokeswoman Karen Bachmann said. Cost-cutting
efforts include using less paper and sending fewer items by overnight
mail, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Jack in the Box is trimming expenses as second-quarter sales are
expected to be less than forecast because of sluggish demand in
markets including San Francisco, Las Vegas and Austin, Texas. Sales
will improve in the second half of the year as the company introduces
a new sandwich and increases advertising on lower-price items, Jack
in the Box said.</LD>
<TE>   "They're tightening their belts," said Jay Pearlstein, senior vice
president of Atlantic Trust Pell Rudman. The firm sold its Jack in
the Box stock about three months ago, he said. Rudman manages about
$8 billion in assets, including shares in Brinker International Inc.,
whose restaurants include Chili's Grill &amp; Bar.</TE>
<TE>   Jack in the Box said it may continue converting some restaurants
to franchises. That also will help reduce costs, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Diego-based Jack in the Box, which has more than
1,800 restaurants, rose 63 cents to $29.76 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock is up 8% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Second-quarter sales will be about $416 million, compared with an
earlier forecast of $420 million, Jack in the Box said. Same-store
sales, or sales at restaurants open at least a year, are expected to
fall about 0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Sales are forecast to rise 1% for the rest of the year as the firm
increases marketing, Jack in the Box said. Jack in the Box was
projected to earn 44 cents in the second quarter and $2.23 this year,
according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>

<HD>Napster Gets 10 Months to Prove Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel on Tuesday gave Napster Inc.
nearly 10 months to prove its claim that the major record companies
have misused copyrights and impeded competition.</LD>
<LD>   Patel gave Redwood City, Calif.-based Napster access to more of
the labels' documents and executives than the record companies had
proposed, and much more time to prepare its case. The labels sought
to wrap up the inquiry within a few months, but Patel's schedule lets
Napster gather evidence until January.</LD>
<LD>   The labels contend that Napster's free song-sharing service
violated their copyrights, and Patel issued a pair of pretrial orders
last year that effectively shut it down. But if the labels misused
their copyrights, Patel said in a Feb. 22 order, they couldn't seek
damages for copyright infringement until after the misuse ended.</LD>
<TE>   Patel isn't expected to decide the issue until next spring, but if
she sides with Napster, the ruling could spill over onto the labels'
other copyright infringement lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Four other online file-sharing services are being sued by the
labels, music publishers and movie studios, and all have accused the
record companies of copyright misuse.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Napster's lawyers will be able to examine
several hundred thousand pages of documents the labels have turned
over to the Justice Department's antitrust division.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators are examining whether the labels violated
antitrust law through their online music ventures--MusicNet, which is
co-owned by RealNetworks Inc. and the parent companies of Warner
Music Group, BMG and EMI, and Pressplay, a joint venture of Universal
Music Group and Sony Music.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Frackman, an attorney for the labels, said his clients
were ready and eager to provide evidence because it will rebut
Napster's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Patel has heard only one side of the story thus far, Frackman
said, and the materials submitted to the Justice Department will
provide the other side.</TE>
<TE>   A Napster spokesman said the ruling gives the company "a
reasonable amount of time" to consider the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one of Napster's original investors sued to oust half
of the company's current board of directors, saying the move was
needed soon in light of a pending offer to buy the company.</TE>
<TE>   John Fanning, uncle of Napster inventor Shawn Fanning, filed suit
Monday in Delaware Chancery Court to replace Hank Barry and John
Hummer on Napster's four-member board with two new members, Joseph
Amram and Martin Kay.</TE>
<TE>   Barry and Hummer joined the board in May 2000 when their venture
capital firm, San Francisco-based Hummer Winblad, poured several
million dollars into Napster.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit claims that shareholders voted to change the board on
March 24, but Barry and Hummer disputed the validity of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The two board members also disputed the conversion of all
Napster's preferred stock, which had controlled the votes in the
privately held company, into common stock March 11.</TE>
<TE>   Napster denied the allegations in the lawsuit and defended the
current makeup of the board, which also includes the elder Fanning
and Konrad Hilbers, who replaced Barry as the company's chief
executive last year.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials declined to say whether the company was in talks
to be acquired.</TE>

<HD>Trade Rises at Region's Ports</HD>
<DH>Economy: Imports at Los Angeles and Long Beach surge 41.2%
in February, showing an increase in consumer spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Combined trade at the two biggest U.S. ports surged in February by
the largest margin since October 2000, reflecting increased consumer
spending and a rebound in demand from the nation's trading partners.</LD>
<LD>   The ports at Los Angeles and Long Beach received 436,681
containers of goods in February, up 41.2% from the same month last
year. Exports rose 12.8% to 175,734 containers.</LD>
<LD>   "Retailers are replenishing their inventories and American
consumers continue to buy as the economic news improves," said
Richard Steinke, the Port of Long Beach's executive director. "This
is good solid growth for this time of the year."</LD>
<TE>   Shipments into Long Beach rose 30.4% to 202,276 containers.
Exports grew 10.3% to 83,333 containers.</TE>
<TE>   Imports into Los Angeles increased 52.2% to 234,405. Exports
climbed 15% to 92,401 containers.</TE>
<TE>   The number of empty containers shipped from Long Beach fell 4.5%
to 77,374. Each container is 20 feet long. Exports of empties from
Los Angeles rose 12.6% to 108,202 containers last month from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The leading imports include electronics, clothing, toys and shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is projected to grow at a 3% annual rate in the coming
quarter, after expanding at a 4.1% pace in the first three months of
the year, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 36 economists.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. added 66,000 jobs in February, the first increase in
seven months, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.5%.
That helped boost consumer confidence, which paid off in increased
retail sales.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. consumer confidence surged in March, as optimism grew about
the job market in a recovering economy. The Conference Board's gauge
of sentiment rose to 110.2 for the month from 95 in February. This
month's index was the highest since August. Consumer expectations for
the economy six months from now soared to the highest in 11/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, said last week
that fiscal first-quarter sales at stores open at least a year will
be at the upper end of forecasts of an increase of 5% to 7%.</TE>

<HD>King Reignites Flame</HD>
<DH>U.S. franchisees are hopeful recent changes and expected
split from distant parent will lift sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Ralph Cimmarusti, Burger King's expected separation from its
British-based parent won't be soon enough.</LD>
<LD>   As president of Glendale-based Cimm's Inc., Cimmarusti is one of
Burger King's largest franchisees, with 110 restaurants in several
states. But sales have fallen badly, from $175 million in 1999 to
$150 million last year, and his company is in bankruptcy
reorganization.</LD>
<LD>   Like other Burger King operators, Cimmarusti blames his
misfortunes largely on corporate problems under the stewardship of
liquor giant Diageo: no new products, inconsistent advertising,
discounting that cut into sales, problems with kids' meal toys and a
revolving door of faraway chief executives, who for the most part in
recent years were neither accessible nor in tune with Burger King's
2,180 franchisees in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   "Diageo buried us in the dungeon of a huge corporation and threw
away the ... key," said Julian Josephson, a San Diego-based
franchisee and chairman of the Burger King National Franchisee Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Josephson and others see rays of hope as Diageo, the
producer of Smirnoff vodka and other spirits, prepares to unload
Burger King so it can focus on its drinks business. A buyer is
expected to be announced this spring, and to prime the company for
sale, Diageo has been busily sprucing up Burger King's operations in
recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's No. 2 fast-food chain has added a slew of menu
items--including a flame-broiled veggie burger--revamped its
advertising campaign and hired dozens of consultants and trainers to
help improve service, food quality and cleanliness.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's Corp. too has been implementing a back-to-basics
strategy, as big hamburger chains have been hurt by an expanding
array of fresh fast-food offerings. The burger giant said last week
that earnings would fall for the sixth consecutive quarter, partly
because of fears of "mad-cow" disease in Japan. On Tuesday, Jack in
the Box Inc. in San Diego announced that sales at restaurants open at
least one year, a key industry measure, would fall slightly in the
current quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But Burger King's slide has been particularly bad. The number of
customers visiting the typical Burger King restaurant every day has
fallen, on average, by 20% in the last five years. Its share of U.S.
burger sales was down to 18.8% in 2000 from more than 20% just two
years earlier. By comparison, McDonald's share rose slightly to 43.1%
in that two-year period, and Wendy's International Inc., the No. 3
burger chain, rose to 12.7% from 11.5%, according to industry
research firm Technomic Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Burger King is "not seen as having good service or good food,"
said Claes Fornell, a professor of marketing and management at the
University of Michigan. "They're kind of like McDonald's, but their
fries aren't as good."</TE>
<TE>   Burger King executives concede that times have been hard, saying
that one in five franchise operators are struggling financially. At
least 11 franchisees, including Cimmarusti, are in bankruptcy
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   But the worst appears over, and Burger King's new chief executive,
John Dasburg, who joined the company in April, has moved quickly to
stop the bloodletting. Under a new management team assembled by the
former head of Northwest Airlines Corp., Burger King reported that
U.S. same-store sales increased 1% for the six months ended Dec. 31,
contrasted with a 6% drop for the same period a year earlier. It was
the first jump in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Dasburg has set the ambitious goal of fattening the chain's market
share to 23% by the end of 2004. To win back customers and generate
buzz, the company has begun introducing new products for the first
time in three years, including a Chicken Whopper that debuts April 1.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Burger King has made its shakes creamier and
thicker by adding ice cream. It dressed up the Whopper with larger
pieces of lettuce, thicker slices of tomatoes and pickles with a
stronger dill flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Aldredge, 36, a Burger King regular for the last 15 years,
has noticed the difference. The Costa Mesa resident, who eats at
Burger King twice a week, said he liked the new and improved food so
much he might easily double his visits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best fast food I've ever had," he said, clutching a
double Whopper with cheese. "And it's getting better."</TE>
<TE>   However, new products and variety might not be the sales drivers
Burger King executives expect. McDonald's much-hyped New Tastes Menu,
which rotates new products year-round, has failed to attract hordes
of new customers. In a recent national survey, Villa Park restaurant
consultant Robert L. Sandelman found fast-food customers ranked
cleanliness, taste and food flavor ahead of choice, which placed 11th
out of 12 categories.</TE>
<TE>   And to steal market share measurably, Burger King needs several
"home-run" products, said restaurant consultant Randall Hiatt,
president of Fessel International in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Burger King is by no means banking on new products alone to boost
sales. For years, the chain aired fuzzy, forgettable TV spots,
including one that featured sultry actress Kathleen Turner asking
viewers if they "got the urge."</TE>
<TE>   Now, it has launched a back-to-basics campaign that highlights
flame-broiling and made-to-order sandwiches, among Burger King's
strongest selling points, said Chris Clouser, the company's new
executive vice president of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   In early March, Burger King unveiled a trio of TV ads, including
one featuring Lakers basketball star Shaquille O'Neal that spotlights
the 45th anniversary of the Whopper. Because the company has "one of
the best brand equities in the fast-food business," showcasing the
sandwich makes good sense, said Allan Hickok, a U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray analyst in Minneapolis. Upcoming ads will feature new
products.</TE>
<TE>   But Burger King's new products and ad campaign may not be enough
to reverse the chain's fortunes in the over-saturated burger market,
said Bob Goldin, a Technomic executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   The company is "swimming against the tide," he said. "McDonald's,
Wendy's and Jack in the Box aren't going to sit still. It's tough out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Demographic trends also are working against Burger King. The
population of young people, fast-food's core market, is growing at a
much slower rate than the 45-to-65 age group, said Mark Sheridan, an
analyst at Johnson Rice &amp; Co. in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from his past successes, though, CEO Dasburg seems up to
the task of taking on the competition and turning the chain around,
industry experts said.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1990, he took over troubled Northwest, which little more
than one year later teetered on the verge of bankruptcy. Dasburg
averted insolvency by extracting wage concessions from unions and
hammering out agreements with lenders, no small feat, said Michael
Boyd of Boyd Group, an aviation consulting firm in Colorado. Under
Dasburg's leadership, Northwest dramatically improved its on-time
performance and bumped fewer customers from flights. By the late
1990s, Northwest also had paid off its once-staggering debt.</TE>
<TE>   As at Northwest, Dasburg's efforts at Burger King have won kudos.</TE>
<TE>   "Burger King is starting to roar," said Credit Suisse First Boston
analyst Janice L. Meyer. "Investors are apt to hear more from Burger
King in the next few months than they have in the past several
years."</TE>
<TE>   Burger King's roots stretch back more than five decades.</TE>
<TE>   James McLamore and David Edgerton founded it in 1954 in Miami,
selling hamburgers for 18 cents and Whoppers for 37 cents. By the
time Pillsbury Co. acquired the chain in 1967, it had grown to 274
restaurants. In 1988, Grand Metropolitan acquired Pillsbury, and nine
years later Grand Met merged with Guinness to form Diageo.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Diageo is about to shed the burger giant. The British
beer-and-liquor concern could announce within three weeks a timetable
and process for the split. Analysts believe a leveraged buyout,
backed by Dasburg, is most likely because Burger King's sluggish
performance makes it unattractive for an initial public stock
offering.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Pacific Group, a buyout outfit, is the slight favorite to
gobble up the burger maker, Morningstar analyst David Kathman said.</TE>
<TE>   Dasburg has acknowledged holding talks with Texas Pacific, which
holds a majority stake in such companies as J. Crew Group Inc. and
America West Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Bain Capital, the Boston-based owner of Domino's Pizza, and
Blackstone Group also are reportedly in the running.</TE>
<TE>   Executives from Texas Pacific, Bain and Blackstone declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the method of separation, Dasburg said he planned to
stick around.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my intent that this will be my last job," said Dasburg, 59.
"I will stay here until either my health knocks me out or I get old."</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence Surges</HD>
<DH>Economy: Although orders for durable goods in February also
jump, analysts remain cautious about prospects for further growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer confidence surged in March and orders for durable goods held
firm in February, evidence the U.S. economy has bolted out of
recession. But the two reports Tuesday raised questions about the
strength of recovery later this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board said its closely watched index of consumer
confidence reached its highest level since August, rallying to 110.2
in March. That beat forecasts of a rise to 98.8 and was up from a
revised 95.0 in February.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, durable goods rose 1.5% to $179.4 billion in February
after a downwardly revised 1.3% gain in January, the Commerce
Department said.</LD>
<TE>   The report was stronger than analysts' expectations of a 1.0%
gain. But excluding transportation, February orders were down 1.3%,
and excluding defense, they fell by 0.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Although the reports were positive news for an economy that just
six months ago looked headed for a long and deep recession after the
Sept. 11 attacks, financial markets scaled back the likelihood the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its May meeting to about
50-50 from 80% odds a day earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the rise in February durable goods orders came from
purchases of aircraft and defense capital goods--not from the more
sustainable consumer or business spending.</TE>
<TE>   Economists cautioned that already-strong consumer spending, which
makes up two-thirds of the economy, may have little room to
accelerate and help boost the economy further.</TE>
<TE>   The confidence report showed scant improvement in intentions to
buy new cars, washing machines or take long vacations.</TE>
<TE>   "The confidence numbers really provide a lot of support for [Fed
Chairman Alan] Greenspan's view that there's no pent-up demand in the
economy and therefore we need to look to the business sector," said
Drew Matus, senior financial economist at Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Yet businesses lack the profitability to spend.</TE>
<TE>   "The durable goods orders show that the business sector really
isn't in any condition to lead us out of the recession. So you take
all those in hand with the Fed comments made earlier today and the
Fed's not going anywhere [with interest rates] any time soon," Matus
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Fed President Robert McTeer said Tuesday that he was "not
in a hurry" to raise short-term interest rates, and Fed Board
Governor Mark Olson said uncertainty about the strength of the
recovery was "considerable."</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board said its present situation index, which
measures views of the economy right now, posted its largest one-month
gain in 25 years, reaching 111.5 in March, up from 96.4 in February.</TE>
<TE>   The expectations index, a gauge of consumers' six-month outlook,
rallied to 109.3 from 94.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer confidence has risen for three of the last four months; a
similar gauge of sentiment from the University of Michigan also
showed a sharp bounce in mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts track the indexes for clues on future consumer spending.</TE>

<HD>Forecast Shows Muted Recovery</HD>
<DH>Economy: Despite upbeat news, UCLA analysts see weakness as
nation emerges from recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA business forecasters, the first in the nation to predict last
year's recession, are once again voicing caution, this time about the
strength of the fledgling recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a spate of upbeat economic news and rosy predictions by
other prominent forecasters, UCLA analysts are holding fast to their
assessment that the national recovery will be one of the most muted
on record. The quarterly UCLA Anderson Forecast being released today
predicts U.S. gross domestic product growth of no more than 2% or 3%
this year, much lower than the 4% to 5% bounce the U.S. economy
typically sees coming out of recession.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the wariness stems from debt-strapped U.S. consumers, who
did their part during the downturn and thus can't be expected to have
enough pent-up demand to stoke the economy. That leaves businesses to
pick up the slack and drive the recovery forward. But UCLA economy
watchers see little evidence that companies will return to investing
heavily in technology and capital equipment during a period of flimsy
corporate profits.</LD>
<TE>   Throw in a shaky export sector and anemic job growth, and you've
got a recovery without much pep in 2002, said Edward E. Leamer,
director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no locomotive pulling the economy forward," Leamer said.
"This isn't going to be a typical recovery ... with a strong bounce
back."</TE>
<TE>   Other economists recently have upped their GDP projections, in
part because U.S. companies are beginning to rebuild depleted
inventories and to purchase more capital equipment. This month
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for example, raised its first-quarter GDP growth
estimate to 3.5% from 2% and is calling for 5% annualized growth for
the second half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'm much more optimistic than the UCLA folks," said
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch in New York.
"These low-ball forecasts are underestimating the dynamism of the
U.S. economy."</TE>
<TE>   But UCLA economists, who issue forecasts for the national and
state economies every three months, contend there is reason for
caution.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, some of the cushions that have been supporting
consumer spending appear to be deflating. Mortgage refinancing, which
put billions of dollars into homeowners' hands, has slowed as
interest rates have risen.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, UCLA economists are doubtful that spending on high-tech
equipment and other capital goods will rebound significantly this
year. Leamer said heavy investments in information technology tools
in the late '90s never translated into profits for many business
owners, who now are looking for measurable returns before committing
to such spending.</TE>
<TE>   "Business investment collapsed because companies couldn't figure
out where the profits were," Leamer said. "It's unlikely that they've
solved that problem."</TE>
<TE>   In California, which weathered the downturn better than much of
the rest of the country, UCLA analysts nevertheless are projecting
the weakest job creation since the early '90s. On average, they
expect nonfarm payrolls to increase by only about 106,000 jobs in
2002--an average growth rate of 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   In February, California posted an unemployment rate of 6.1% while
the U.S. rate was 5.5%. But sluggish job growth here and nationwide
is likely to push up both those figures in coming months, said Tom
Lieser, senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast. He said
that the U.S. jobless rate could rise to about 5.7% and that
California's could hit the 6.4% range later in the year and stay that
way until late 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The state's budget woes also could prove a drag on the California
economy, Lieser said, hindering government spending that otherwise
could have primed the economic pump. Due in part to the steep drop in
tax revenue from tech-related capital gains, stock options and bonus
revenue, California is facing a budget deficit of $17 billion, by
some estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's forcing cuts on things like infrastructure improvements,"
Lieser said. State government spending "isn't going to be a major
source of stimulus."</TE>
<TE>   He said export trade, which has been pounded by a strong dollar
and weak overseas economies, also will be a constraint on
California's near-term growth.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate, a mainstay of the state's economy during last year's
downturn, should remain a bright spot, though the recent heady levels
of appreciation in Southern California could slow as buyers are
priced out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Lieser said the Southland's diverse economy should continue to be
a source of stability, particularly Orange and San Diego counties,
where unemployment is still less than 4%, and the Inland Empire,
which continues to pump jobs into the region.</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles County, whose February employment rate of
6.4% is the highest in the five-county area, faces some particular
challenges. Over the last year, for example, L.A. County has lost
17,000 motion picture jobs due to runaway production and an ongoing
restructuring of the movie business, said UCLA economist Christopher
Thornberg.</TE>
<TE>   He said the 12% drop in industry employment is similar to the
plunge in aerospace jobs in the early 1990s. But he said it hasn't
registered the same shock on the regional economy because the
entertainment industry is fundamentally healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're evolving from a production center to a design center," said
Thornberg, who will discuss the future of the region's entertainment
industry today at UCLA's quarterly forecasting conference. "But
that's not a bad thing."</TE>

<HD>Global Tries to Stop N.Y. Station Eviction</HD>
<DH>Telecom: In a court filing, the company says that leaving
the Level 3 site would cut access to transatlantic cable line and
slash value.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A creditor's effort to evict Global Crossing Ltd. from a New York
site where a fiber-optic cable from England hooks into the network of
U.S. land lines would wipe out a third of Global's transatlantic
telephone traffic and slash the company's value to potential buyers,
the company argues in a court document.</LD>
<LD>   The attempt by Level 3 Communications Ltd., which is both
competitor and ally, also would cut off Global's $180-million
investment in the Atlantic Ocean cable line and seize a Long Island,
N.Y., station that Global has spent $20million upgrading, Global said
in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, which is sorting
out the nation's fourth-largest business failure.</LD>
<LD>   "Once you start pulling the plug on various network elements, it
very quickly reduces Global's value and the likelihood that anything
will be salvaged," said Richard Elliott, co-founder of bandwidth
broker Band-X Ltd. in London.</LD>
<TE>   Level 3's motion to throw Global out of the station may well be
denied by a court bent on conserving assets. But it shows the
precariousness of Global's vaunted worldwide network and the
dependence all telecommunications companies have on each other,
especially at a time when financial troubles seem to be having a
domino effect.</TE>
<TE>   "What some people are realizing through this whole telecom
meltdown is that the livelihood of these companies is dependent on
the livelihood of all the other companies," said Ron Banaszek,
director of TFS Telecom, a unit of energy trader TFS Energy in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   And that can become a problem as cash-strapped companies like
Level 3 are looking for rent, fees and other payments from firms such
as Global Crossing that have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller problems can reverberate throughout the industry, creating
havoc at other companies, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 executives and lawyers would not discuss the dispute,
which goes beyond the eviction effort. Cynthia Artin, a Global
Crossing spokeswoman, said the two companies are in talks to try to
settle their differences before an April 11 hearing. The amount at
issue is small, perhaps about $5 million, she said, and Global is
confident the two can resolve their differences.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been having very constructive talks," Artin said.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, the companies outline a business arrangement to
jointly build a fiber-optic cable from Bude, England, to Bellport,
N.Y., with each owning half the capacity on the line. Global already
owns two transatlantic lines.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the construction agreement, Global was to lease space
in Level 3 facilities at each end-point, where the so-called Yellow
Cable System is connected to land lines to complete calls.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 contends that Global Crossing never signed the leases even
though it started occupying the facilities in November 2000. Without
alleging any amount owed, Level 3 sent a notice of default to Global
the Friday before Global's bankruptcy filing Jan. 28.</TE>

<HD>Lincoln Rolls Out New SUV</HD>
<DH>Autos: Ford Motor's luxury division is banking on the
Aviator to revive sales and attract younger buyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>American luxury hasn't sold very well in the car market in recent
years, not even in America.</LD>
<LD>   But now Lincoln, Ford Motor Co.'s premium division, is banking on
an all-new truck lineup to revive sagging sales and restore some
luster to the brand, which has been broadsided by the booming
popularity of luxury imports.</LD>
<LD>   The new Lincoln Aviator, a mid-size luxury sport utility vehicle
based on the Ford Explorer, is being revealed today at the New York
International Auto Show. Irvine-based Lincoln hopes that it will
boost interest, especially among younger buyers, in the brand, which
plummeted from the No. 1 position among luxury marques in 1998 to No.
6 last year.</LD>
<TE>   "We continued to be inundated by competition in a variety of forms
from the Asians and Europeans," Lincoln President Brian Kelley said
at a preview of the Aviator.</TE>
<TE>   "The game's all about product, and you need to consistently
refresh your product in a way that can be cadenced well: constant
launches of new products," Kelley said. "And we didn't have that for
a while."</TE>
<TE>   The Aviator, which hits the market in late summer, is one of four
new Lincolns this year. The others are a refreshed 2003 Town Car,
with a new frame and interior, which goes on sale in late spring; the
all-new Navigator, which arrives in showrooms this summer; and a
significantly redone LS sedan, which goes on sale at the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Aviator is built on the Explorer's platform, with its
independent rear suspension, a stiffened frame and suspension
updates. It has the characteristic Lincoln chrome grille and a lavish
leather interior including seat heater-coolers and a fold-flat third
row of rear seats. It is powered by a 4.6-liter, 302-horsepower V-8
engine.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley said he expects that 85% of Aviator buyers will be new to
Lincoln, bringing in that all-important target: younger buyers who
will stay with the brand through future vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   With the Aviator and Navigator, Lincoln is seeking a fun driving
experience, a characteristic that BMW and Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus
boast but that Lincoln has lacked.</TE>
<TE>   Ford plans to build 30,000 to 35,000 Aviators a year at its St.
Louis plant, which also makes Mercury Mountaineer SUVs. Pricing has
not been decided, but with the Mountaineer selling from $28,000 to
$35,000 and the Navigator starting at $48,000, it's likely that the
Aviator will have a sticker price of $40,000 to $42,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although the flagship Town Car is still the domain of over-60
customers, the current Navigator has helped bring down the average
age of Lincoln buyers to 55.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln Vice President Richard Beattie said he hopes that the
Aviator attracts buyers whose average age is 42, which with a younger
Navigator customer would bring the average age of Lincoln owners to
about 50.</TE>
<TE>   "Lincoln very successfully brought down the age of their buyers,"
said Michael Ward, senior auto analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
"They went from a limo company to one that can sell to actual
customers outside of Florida."</TE>
<TE>   "But it's all about how they're going to get me and you into their
showrooms; I for one am not going to go buy a Town Car," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln, a perennial No. 2 to General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac
division for decades in the U.S. market, edged out its GM rival in
1998, 187,000 to 175,000, before DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz took
the luxury crown in 1999 and Lexus the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac, the No. 4 luxury brand last year, has worked on its
truck lineup and is now turning its attention to passenger cars.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln's truck strategy "potentially can work," said Jim Hall,
vice president of the consultancy AutoPacific in Detroit. "It's an
affordable Navigator is what it amounts to. It gets more people to
come to the brand."</TE>
<TE>   But it also means "they're turning into a truck company--a brand
where the most visible, desirable vehicles are trucks," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley is not ready to talk about revamping Lincoln's passenger
car lineup. The Continental has been canceled, and new cars based
loosely on the recently shown concept Continental sedan and Mark IX
coupe won't be coming until 2005.</TE>
<TE>   But to claw its way back toward the top, Lincoln will have to push
past Cadillac, which has just put a new sedan on the market and has a
lot more in the pipeline than Lincoln.</TE>

<DH>Wall Street: The news boosts shares of retailers, but early
rally eases on concern over coming earnings reports.</DH>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks climbed Tuesday after consumer confidence bolted to its
highest level since August, but an early rally faded as investors
opted for caution ahead of a flood of corporate earnings reports.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average gave up most of an early
151-point gain before stabilizing late in the day and closing up
71.69 points, or 0.7%, at 10,353.36, snapping a four-day losing
streak.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index gained 11.68 points, or 0.6%, to
1,824.17, after climbing 31 points earlier and then dipping into
negative ground in late trading. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
finished up 0.6%.</LD>
<TE>   Winners edged losers by 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Volume was light, as it is expected to be all
week due to the Easter and Passover holidays. U.S. markets will be
closed Good Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The market's rally was fueled by the Conference Board's report
that consumer confidence has surged this month as better prospects
for jobs and a healthier business climate boosted Americans' spirits.
Consumer spending is viewed as a linchpin for any economic rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer stocks rose on the news, including Wal-Mart Stores, up 89
cents to $62.17, Home Depot, up 55 cents to $49, and Coca-Cola, which
climbed 85 cents to $52.60 after reporting strong shipments.</TE>
<TE>   The market also got an early lift from comments by Robert McTeer,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who helped to soothe
investors' growing worries that signs of economic strength could
convince the Fed to raise interest rates later in the year. McTeer
said inflation pressures should continue to ease in the coming
months, leaving the Fed room to hold off on policy adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   But a government report that orders for some durable goods fell
unexpectedly in February revived doubts among investors about the
strength of the economic recovery and the outlook for first-quarter
corporate profits.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we get the string of earnings that are due to start hitting
in the next few weeks, I think the market is going to struggle to
find any persistent direction," said Charles White, president of
investment firm Avatar Associates.</TE>
<TE>   McTeer's comments and the durable goods report helped push down
bond yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slid to
5.34% from 5.41% on Monday. The Treasury is set to sell a record $25
billion in new two-year notes today.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * A rally in financial-services firms' shares helped the Dow. J.P.
Morgan Chase rose 20 cents to $35.15; Citigroup climbed 50 cents to
$49.15 and American Express gained 22 cents to $40.60. The
Philadelphia Stock Exchange's bank index rose 1.1%.</TE>
<TE>   * The latest merger news helped boost the market. Royal
Dutch/Shell Group said it will acquire Pennzoil-Quaker State, maker
of the top two motor oil brands in the United States, for $1.8
billion in cash. Pennzoil-Quaker jumped $6.01 to $21.50; Royal Dutch
gained 65 cents to $53.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Accounting jitters came to the forefront again after computer
security provider Network Associates said federal securities
regulators are investigating its past accounting practices, forcing
the company to delay plans to buy the rest of McAfee.com. Network
Associates, down $2.77 at $22.23, was the fourth most actively traded
stock on the NYSE. McAfee.com fell $2.96 to $15.55.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Tyco International eased 34 cents to $32. The company's CIT
Group finance unit raised $2.5 billion in a bond offering, but at
higher yields than comparable bonds at other firms. Tyco's accounting
has been the subject of repeated scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   * Auto parts makers Dana, BorgWarner and Dura Automotive Systems
climbed after saying first-quarter profits will exceed forecasts
because auto makers built and sold more vehicles than expected. Dana
rose 74 cents to $19.33, BorgWarner gained $2.29 to $60.78, and Dura
Automotive jumped $3.57 to $18.50.</TE>

<HD>UBS Downgrade of WorldCom Another Blow to Telecom Giant</HD>
<DH>Shares tumble as analyst says company may undertake a
restructuring because of weak demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom-MCI Group's annualized stock dividend yield of 30%-plus
looks too good to be true, and probably is, a brokerage told clients
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The warning helped drive MCI Group shares (ticker symbol: MCIT)
down $1.23, or 16%, to $6.30 on Nasdaq, in another blow to the
devastated telecom-stock sector.</LD>
<LD>   UBS Warburg analyst John Hodulik said struggling parent company
WorldCom may undertake a restructuring that could lead to a cut in
MCI's annual cash dividend, now $2.40 a share.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom created the MCI Group shares in June to track the telecom
giant's consumer long-distance business. The high dividend was meant
to attract investors otherwise worried about the industry's problems.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Hodulik downgraded parent WorldCom shares to "hold"
from "buy," citing the "increased likelihood" that WorldCom may shift
debt to MCI, cut MCI's dividend or fold MCI Group shares back into
WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares (WCOM) fell 41 cents to $6.11 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   At MCI Group's Tuesday stock close, the annualized dividend yield
based on a $2.40-a-share dividend is 38%. That is more than 10 times
the 3.62% yield on a two-year Treasury note--assuming that MCI
continues to pay the dividend at the stated rate.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday was the stock's ex-dividend date, meaning investors who
buy the shares now aren't entitled to the 60-cent quarterly dividend
to be paid in April.</TE>
<TE>   At WorldCom, a spokeswoman said WorldCom Chairman Bernard Ebbers
"said we would be able to continue to pay the MCI dividend based on
the business plan we have for this year." The spokeswoman also said
that "combining the [tracking stock] is not being considered."</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan West Launches New Funds</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan West Capital Management, a Newport Beach-based
institutional money manager, said it launched its first retail mutual
funds Tuesday, joining the increasingly crowded marketplace for
"value"-oriented stock funds.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's Intrinsic Value Equity Fund and International Value
Fund are co-managed by Howard Gleicher and Gary Lisenbee, who have
worked together for more than a decade running portfolios for large
clients.</TE>
<TE>   The new funds, which carry no load, or sales fee, require a
minimum initial investment of $5,000 (or $1,000 for retirement
accounts).</TE>
<TE>   Value funds--those focusing on companies with low share prices
relative to earnings and other criteria--generally have outperformed
"growth" funds (which focus on companies with fast-growing sales and
earnings) over the last two years. That makes it easier to market new
value funds to investors, analysts note. Other firms that recently
have launched new value-style funds include Turner Investment
Partners and Harbor Funds.</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan West Capital, which manages more than $2 billion, is
an affiliate of Los Angeles-based Metropolitan West Financial, which
hired former Vice President Al Gore as a pitchman in November.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Judge Weighs Broader Sanctions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft Corp. antitrust case said
Tuesday that she wants to know more about new computer technologies
such as hand-held devices to determine whether sanctions against
Microsoft should cover these items.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's request boosted the
spirits of nine states seeking stronger antitrust sanctions against
Microsoft, who have argued for remedies that protect markets that
have arisen since the trial began.</LD>
<LD>   The judge, who has expressed reservations about broadening the
case, said she needed to learn more "to determine whether it falls
beyond the outer reaches of a remedy."</LD>
<TE>   "I've decided that I need more factual information, frankly,"
Kollar-Kotelly said during hearings on the remedies demanded by the
states that have rejected a proposed settlement agreed to by the
Justice Department in November.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Greene, an attorney for the state of California, said the
remarks signal Kollar-Kotelly may be willing to impose broader
sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   But Greene acknowledged that the states still have a "heavy
burden" of proof in making the case for stricter sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is important to the case because Kollar-Kotelly must
decide whether the remedies should be designed to address only past
misdeeds, or go further and try to restrain Microsoft's forays into
new areas.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has argued the sanctions cannot go beyond specific
wrongdoing upheld by a federal appeals court last year, mainly that
Microsoft tried to crush Netscape's Internet browser in an illegal
effort to preserve its Windows monopoly in personal computer
operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   The company has filed legal motions asking the judge to discard
all evidence that is not directly related to the monopoly market at
issue in the original case--personal computer operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly said Tuesday that she has made no final decision
about how broad the scope of the remedy should be. And the judge said
she will consider Microsoft's objections.</TE>

<HD>Network Associates Accounting Under Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA CLARA</DL>
<LD>Network Associates Inc. disclosed Tuesday that the federal government
is investigating the accounting methods employed by the Internet
security company in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry also is forcing Network Associates to delay its bid to
acquire the 25% of computer virus-fighter McAfee.com that it does not
already own. Shares of both companies fell more than 10%.</LD>
<LD>   Network Associates said the Securities and Exchange Commission is
examining practices that led to three major events Dec. 26, 2000.
That day, Network Associates' three top executives resigned, the
company announced a massive revenue and profit shortfall and it
changed how it recognized revenue for products sold through
third-party distributors.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive George Samenuk said the inquiry is focusing on
issues that predate his management team. But he said the 2000
accounting practices have been reviewed and approved again by the
company's outside auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the books are proper," Samenuk said during a
conference call with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   He said the SEC probe would have no effect on the firm's daily
operations or future opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is forcing the company to postpone its bid to buy the
remaining stock of McAfee.com, the company spun off from Network
Associates in 1999. McAfee executives have called Network Associates'
offer too low.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has turned its fortunes around since the management
upheaval and financial disclosure of late 2000. It lost $99 million
last year on sales of $834 million but achieved pro forma
profitability and a recovery in its stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Network Associates shares fell 11%, or $2.77, to $22.23.
McAfee.com shares fell 16%, or $2.96, to $15.55.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC had no comment on the Network Associates investigation.</TE>

<HD>Crude Oil Inventories Down 1.9% in U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More bad news for anyone with a gas tank to fill: U.S. crude oil
inventories fell more than expected last week as imports plunged to a
two-year low, the American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The inventory decline of 6.2 million barrels, or 1.9%, reported by
the Washington-based industry group was the largest in five months.
It came at a time when U.S. refiners need to boost production of
gasoline for the summer, when driving demand peaks.</LD>
<LD>   "It will be difficult for refiners to ramp up production of
gasoline" if imports stay so low, said Phil Flynn, senior market
analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   Gasoline prices have surged in recent weeks as major oil exporters
have kept a lid on production while demand has risen with the
reviving economy.</TE>
<TE>   The current average national price of $1.342 for a gallon of
self-serve regular grade is the highest since early October, though
down 6cents from a year ago, according to the Energy Information
Administration's weekly survey of more than 800 service stations.</TE>
<TE>   The most expensive gasoline is on the West Coast, where the
average price for a gallon of self-serve regular was $1.478 in the
latest survey, the EIA said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said crude oil imports fell last week in part because
heavy fog in the Houston Ship Channel kept tankers away.</TE>
<TE>   Those cargoes are in the pipeline, but other factors also may
limit imports. For one, Iraqi oil exports have been running well
below normal levels in recent weeks because Iraq is again in a
dispute with the United Nations over the country's U.N.-supervised
export program, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. crude oil imports fell 13% to 7.38 million barrels a day last
week, the lowest rate since the week ended Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, more refineries should be coming back on stream
soon as winter maintenance downtime ends, experts said. If enough
crude arrives, refineries would be in better shape to process it.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices will probably go higher but should fall short of
the record $1.70 a gallon reached in May, said the EIA's acting
director, Mary Hutzler.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the agency predicted that gasoline prices
would rise 20 cents by June to an average $1.33 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   But gas costs increased by that much in three weeks, instead of
the expected three months, and are already above the predicted
average pump price.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil futures in New York gained 37 cents to $25.36 a barrel
Tuesday in regular trading before the oil inventory data were
reported.</TE>
<TE>   In after-hours trading the price rose to $25.78 a barrel, the
highest since September. The price was $19.84 at the start of the
year.</TE>

<HD>Slatkin Agrees to Plead Guilty</HD>
<DH>Crime: Money manager could get 15 years in prison for
running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Barbara money manager Reed Slatkin, who built an illusory
investment empire using money collected from Hollywood celebrities,
Internet moguls and fellow Scientologists, agreed Tuesday to plead
guilty to 15 counts of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy for
masterminding one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.</LD>
<LD>   Slatkin, who collected $593 million from 800 investors, faces up
to 105 years in prison, although his sentence probably will be "in
the 12-to-15-year range," said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The sentence could be further reduced by a few years if Slatkin,
53, cooperates fully with investigators, who still are trying to
determine what happened to investors' money, Mrozek said.</LD>
<TE>   Slatkin has acknowledged that at least $255million is missing in
the scheme, in which new investors' money was used to pay bogus
returns to prior investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very significant sentence for a consensual plea
agreement," said Richard Wynne, an attorney for creditors in
Slatkin's bankruptcy case. But he added, "We calculated he could have
gotten a life sentence if this had gone to trial, so it's a sweet
deal for him."</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's agreement, Slatkin was charged with six counts of
money laundering, five counts of mail fraud, three counts of wire
fraud and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin, who also faces a $3.75-million fine, has been ordered to
make restitution to his victims, although it is unclear how much
money will be recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Investors greeted news of the plea agreement warily. Some fear
Slatkin might flee the country before his arraignment on an
unspecified date next month.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had 11 months to pack," said investor George Kriste, "and
now he's got another 30 days."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office have said they don't
believe Slatkin will try to escape. Slatkin's criminal attorney,
Brian Sun, said his client was determined to cooperate with
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "This is obviously a very emotional time for him, but he's
committed to doing the right thing," Sun said. "His conduct speaks
for itself."</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin has agreed to turn himself in to federal custody at his
arraignment, but he won't be sentenced until several weeks later,
Mrozek said.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin, an ordained minister in the Church of Scientology,
started soliciting money from fellow Scientologists in the mid-1980s.
His stature and reputation grew after he helped co-found Internet
service provider EarthLink Inc. in 1994. Before long, he was taking
in large sums from Internet executives, Hollywood players and
socialites from across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin's investors included legal commentator Greta Van Susteren,
actors Peter Coyote and Giovanni Ribisi, EarthLink co-founder Sky
Dayton and HGTV host Susie Coehlo, among others. He managed money for
entire families, including retirement accounts, college funds and, in
one case, lawsuit proceeds for an accident victim who was paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm told I'm supposed to be happy with [Slatkin's plea]," said
investor John Poitras, who says he lost $15 million in the scheme.
"But the penalties here are just disconnected to the damage he's
done."</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin told investors he was putting their money to work in the
stock market. Although he paid out hundreds of millions in purported
stock market profits to investors, he made only about $65million in
actual gains, according to the trustee appointed by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin, meanwhile, moved up from a suburban home in Goleta,
Calif., to an estate in the Hope Ranch area of Santa Barbara. He
spent money on private jets, million-dollar artworks and real estate
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin's empire began unraveling in April, when several investors
sued him for failing to return their funds. On May 1, Slatkin filed
for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The obstruction of justice charge stems from Slatkin's
acknowledgement that he lied to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which as early as 1997 investigated him for operating an
unregistered money management business. Slatkin's Ponzi scheme
avoided detection, however, until investors sued.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have criticized the SEC for failing to uncover the
scheme, but SEC officials saw the plea agreement as a vindication.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased that Mr. Slatkin will be held accountable for
obstruction of our investigation," said Randall Lee, director of the
SEC's Pacific region. "We take misconduct and lies to us extremely
seriously."</TE>

<HD>3 Big Companies Named in Slave Reparations Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Action on behalf of descendants seeks compensation
from Aetna, CSX and FleetBoston Financial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three large U.S. companies were named in a lawsuit filed Tuesday on
behalf of black Americans descended from slaves, the first potential
class action seeking reparations from firms for profiting from
slavery.</LD>
<LD>   Aetna Inc., CSX Corp. and FleetBoston Financial Corp. were named
in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., by Deadria
Farmer-Paellmann, 36, in the latest step by some blacks to get
compensation for what their ancestors suffered as slaves.</LD>
<LD>   Aetna and CSX said slavery was a regrettable chapter in U.S.
history but the events in question occurred so long ago that a
courtroom was not the proper venue to decide on reparations.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys said 12 other companies would be getting letters in the
coming days requesting a dialogue on a settlement, and that as many
as 1,000 unidentified corporations may have profited from slavery.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint did not contain a monetary damage figure, but did
estimate the current value of slaves' unpaid labor as $1.4 trillion.
The gross domestic product of the United States at the end of 2001
was $10.25 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case about wealth built on the back and from the sweat
of African slaves," said plaintiff attorney Roger Wareham. "We expect
those companies that are targeted to stand up."</TE>
<TE>   Wareham said any damages collected would be put into a fund to
improve health, education and housing opportunities for African
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of reparations for slavery say the descendants of slaves
are being hurt economically and sociologically by their ancestors'
bondage.</TE>
<TE>   Those who argue against compensation say, among other things, that
it happened so long ago that reparations would be punishing people
who had nothing to do with the practice of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, FleetBoston is the successor to
Providence Bank, which was founded by Rhode Island businessman John
Brown. Brown owned ships that embarked on several slaving voyages,
and the suit says FleetBoston lent substantial sums to Brown, thus
financing and profiting from his slave trade.</TE>
<TE>   FleetBoston also collected customs fees from ships transporting
slaves, thus profiting further, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   FleetBoston did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges Aetna's predecessor insured slaveholders against
the loss of their human chattel. Aetna knew the horrors of slave life
as evident in a rider through which the company declined to make
payments on slaves who were lynched, were worked to death or
committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna, the No. 1 U.S. life and health
insurer, said in early March it was considering making an
unprecedented public apology and restitution payment over profit it
made from insuring slaves in America 150 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, an Aetna spokesman said: "We have not been served with
a lawsuit. We do not believe a court would permit a lawsuit over
events which, however regrettable, occurred hundreds of years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Richmond, Va.-based CSX is a successor in interest to numerous
predecessor railroad lines that were constructed or run, at least in
part, by slave labor, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   CSX said in a statement that although slavery was a tragic chapter
in U.S. history, the lawsuit was without merit.</TE>
<TE>   "The claimants named CSX because slave labor was used to construct
portions of some U.S. rail lines under the political and legal system
in place more than a century before CSX was formed in 1980," the
company said. "The courtrooms are the wrong setting for this issue."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeks a jury trial, the appointment of an independent
historic commission, restitution of the descendants' slave labor,
disgorgement of illicit profit and compensatory and punitive damages
to be determined at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff Farmer-Paellmann said that she went to law school with
the goal of suing for damages as a result of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   She said as many as 60 companies had cooperated with her five
years of research and provided documents showing how they had
assisted the institution of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Ed Fagan said that a series of Holocaust lawsuits settled
for $8 billion had blazed the legal trail for the slavery action.</TE>
<TE>   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Aetna shares closed up 34
cents at $37.68, CSX shares up 57 cents at 37.46 and FleetBoston up
23 cents at $35.37.</TE>

<HD>SEC Accuses Former Waste Execs of Fraud</HD>
<DH>Probe: Agency's lawsuit is seen as sending strong message
to corporate America. Defendants vow to fight charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday sued six former
executives of Waste Management Inc., the largest U.S. trash hauler,
accusing them of inflating profit by $1.7 billion in a "massive
financial fraud" the agency said was aided by the Andersen accounting
firm.</LD>
<LD>   The case is the latest in a string of corporate accounting-fraud
suits brought by the SEC in recent years and may be the first of a
new wave: The SEC said it has sharply boosted the number of
accounting probes in the aftermath of Enron Corp.'s collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The former Waste Management executives from 1992 to 1997
"fraudulently manipulated the company's financial results to meet
predetermined earnings targets," the SEC charged.</LD>
<TE>   By deferring or eliminating expenses, among other techniques, the
company was able to meet Wall Street profit expectations and boost
its stock price, thereby enriching the defendants by more than $28
million in performance-based bonuses and other compensation, the
agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary investors, however, lost $6 billion, as the company's
stock plunged after the firm recorded a $1.7-billion earnings
restatement in 1998, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The civil lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, seeks to
recover money from the defendants and bar them from working at a
publicly traded company. The executives are vowing to fight.</TE>
<TE>   The case is an extension of an SEC investigation that resulted in
a settlement last June with Andersen, the company's former auditor.
Andersen paid a record $7 million in fines to settle charges it filed
false audit reports of Waste Management for the years 1993-'96.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, whose chairman, Joseph Berardino, abruptly resigned
Tuesday, is struggling for survival after being indicted this month
for obstruction of justice in connection with its audit work for
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management, which isn't charged in the SEC's case against
the former executives, fired Andersen as its auditor last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Our complaint describes one of the most egregious financial
frauds we have seen," said Thomas C. Newkirk, SEC associate
enforcement director. "For years, these defendants cooked the books,
enriched themselves, preserved their jobs and duped unsuspecting
shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the suit and the harsh language were meant to put
corporate America on notice that "earnings management"--companies'
efforts to make sure they hit quarterly earnings targets--will be
aggressively prosecuted if the SEC determines that anti-fraud rules
have been violated.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very tough language and it does send a signal," said
David S. Ruder, a securities law professor at Northwestern University
and former SEC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years the SEC has sued executives at such firms as
Sunbeam Corp. and W.R. Grace &amp; Co., alleging accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's allegations involve activity that predated Waste
Management's 1998 acquisition by USA Waste Services Inc. Although the
name is the same, Waste Management today is "a different company" and
is not involved in the SEC action, Newkirk said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants, who include company founder Dean L. Buntrock, deny
the charges and contend that Waste Management's accounting was
proper.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for several of the defendants say the SEC brought the suit
partly to deflect criticism, in the aftermath of Enron, that the
agency hasn't been a tough enough regulator. "The SEC has decided it
needs to speak loudly and pound the table post-Enron," said Sarah R.
Wolff, a lawyer for defendant James E. Koenig, Waste Management's
ex-chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Buntrock and Koenig, the accused are Phillip B. Rooney,
who was president and chief operating officer; Thomas C. Hau, former
chief accounting officer; Herbert Getz, former general counsel; and
Bruce D. Tobecksen, ex-vice president of finance.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney, in a statement, declared his innocence and referred to a
1999 letter from Roderick M. Hills, who joined Waste Management in
1997, helped push for accounting changes that resulted in the 1998
earnings restatement and stayed on as chairman of the firm's audit
committee until 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Hills, who led an internal investigation of Waste Management's
bookkeeping, said in the letter to Rooney's lawyers that he was "not
aware of any facts that would suggest that Phil Rooney acted contrary
to the securities laws."</TE>
<TE>   Buntrock, in his defense, apparently will take a more critical
view of the Hills investigation: In a suit he filed last month to try
to head off the SEC's charges, Buntrock said the agency's probe is
tainted by conflict of interest because two current SEC officials
were involved in Hills' probe, which began after Buntrock left the
firm's board in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   For his investigation, Hills hired Robert Herdman, then
co-chairman of Ernst &amp; Young, and Charles Niemeier, a lawyer and
accounting specialist. The two are now the SEC's chief accountant and
the accounting chief of the SEC's enforcement division, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Buntrock says Hills' internal probe formed the basis of the
charges that the SEC lodged against him Tuesday and is therefore
improper.</TE>
<TE>   John T. McCarthy, a lawyer for Buntrock, said the massive 1998
earnings restatement was part of a "big bath" write-down of assets
meant to clear the way for a quick sale of the firm to USA Waste.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's case alleges that Buntrock reaped more than $16.9
million in ill-gotten gains. Rooney reaped more than $9.2 million,
Koenig more than $900,000, Hau more than $600,000, Tobecksen more
than $400,000 and Getz more than $450,000, the SEC contends.</TE>
<TE>   Before it was acquired, Waste Management had a checkered
reputation. The company built up its nationwide garbage-hauling
business by acquiring many local garbage firms, some of which had
unsavory reputations. Waste Management's business practices also were
the targets of dozens of lawsuits nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action last November, Waste Management agreed to pay
$457 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over fraud allegations
involving the firm after the merger with USA Waste.</TE>

<HD>Saban's Donations to Democrats</HD>

<LD>In news reports about the $7-million gift from businessman Haim Saban
to the Democratic Party (March 22-23), it emerged that Saban had also
raised nearly $600,000 for our esteemed governor. Apparently, by the
governor's reckoning, this largess, coupled with Saban's business
acumen and cultural contributions (such as the "Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers"), qualifies him for appointment to the University of
California Board of Regents.</LD>
<LD>   For what is arguably the finest public university system in the
world, how discouraging.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re "He's Giving Himself Quite a Name," March 23: Your front-page
expose of Saban's donations to the Democratic Party has left me
puzzled. Is this some kind of scandal? Did your brave reporters
uncover wrongdoing? Was there a quid pro quo? Now that story is
followed by one on another entertainment industry executive who has
donated large sums to the Democrats ("Democrats Release Another
Blockbuster").</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, surely they must have been spending major time in
Sacramento helping Gov. Gray Davis make policy, a la Ken Lay. After
all, with all the ex-Enron executives now toiling in Washington on
our behalf, and with President Bush's energy policy designed by Lay,
we know what huge donations can buy.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of anything of the sort asked for or received by these
men still leaves me wondering what could have justified these stories
being given such prominence.</TE>

<TE>   Interesting watching our government in action last week. The pious
senators nearly got hurt patting themselves on the back while passing
campaign finance reform. But not until after the November elections.
Better to have one more feeding frenzy at the trough. And we found
out the qualification to get on the UC Board of Regents; just give
Gov. Davis $600,000, like Saban.</TE>
<TE>   And on the local level, who outside their immediate family
believes that Los Angeles City Council members deserve a raise and to
be the highest paid City Council officials in the nation ("Highly
Paid L.A. Council Gets a Raise,'' March 23)? Our "leaders" starring
in the trifecta of greed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From the icy summits of the Hindu Kush to the flat sands stretching
southwest from Herat, betrayal is a theme of Afghan history. Tribes
lie to other tribes to get the upper hand and tattletale to exact
revenge or win favor with a protector. Now it's the United States
that threatens to leave promises unfulfilled.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of the village of Dara-i-Suf told Times correspondent
Jeffrey Gettleman of a U.S. military advisor who appeared in their
midst last October and vowed to give them food and rugs for their
dirt floors. He said his nation would build a clinic, a school and
roads if they helped in the campaign against the Taliban. The
villagers fought hard in the campaign for Mazar-i-Sharif, the first
major victory in the war against Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors.
But the villagers, so short of food they eat a soup of boiled grass,
so frightened of land mines that fields go unplowed, still wait for
the rewards the American promised.</LD>
<TE>   Dara-i-Suf has sharp memories of the man who introduced himself as
"Baba John." Lending credence to villagers' accounts of guiding and
fighting for Special Forces troops is a U.S. Army officer's statement
that he assumed that the American soldiers would say "whatever they
needed to, to win cooperation from locals." In an echo of what was
probably said the last time the U.S. left its Afghan allies in the
lurch, after they had driven out the Soviets, the officer added,
"That doesn't mean we're going down there."</TE>
<TE>   No? Then why should other Afghans believe the honeyed tongues of
Americans? What faith should Iraqis, whose assistance is needed to
topple Saddam Hussein, put in promises?</TE>
<TE>   Besides orchestrating an international force of peacekeepers--and
many more of those are needed--the United States has begun an effort
involving military personnel to rebuild schools, fire stations and
other facilities in reconstructing a shattered nation. But most of
these projects are in the cities. Now the Bush administration should
send soldiers or civilians--send someone--to help the people who
helped us in Dara-i-Suf and anywhere else that Americans made
promises.</TE>
<TE>   Rebuilding Afghanistan will not be quick, easy or cheap. But
neither will the war on terrorism, in which U.S. troops are already
counting on villagers in other nations for support. So it is for
reasons of pragmatism as well as honor that the United States must
stand by its promises as well as its threats.</TE>

<HD>Mr. Bush's Arctic Obsession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush and others who salivate at the prospect of drilling
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska are trying
to convince the American public and the Senate that it can be done
without disrupting the fragile tundra and the caribou, musk ox, polar
bear and snow geese that roam it. The public shouldn't buy this
argument and neither should the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The pro-drilling story as outlined by Sen. Frank H. Murkowski
(R-Alaska) sounds good at first, mainly because it's what Huck Finn
might call "a stretcher." Wells would be drilled on ice pads in the
winter, the senator says. The drilling "footprint" would be only
2,000 acres out of 19 million. A quarter-million jobs would be
generated. There would be ice roads that left no permanent scar on
the tundra.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, oil production would industrialize large portions of the
coastal plain of the Arctic Ocean. The place called America's
Serengeti for its rich diversity of fish, animal and bird life would
no longer be an unspoiled wilderness ecosystem.</LD>
<TE>   Other facts:</TE>
<TE>   * The 2,000 acres, stipulated in the energy bill the House passed,
is not one contiguous drilling site. It is a cumulative figure. There
could be as many as 200 sites of 10 acres each. The prospective oil
deposits are scattered in an estimated 30 reservoirs throughout the
plain. The 2,000-acre figure does not include pipelines or access
roads.</TE>
<TE>   * If oil is discovered and produced, there will have to be
pipelines linking each well to take the crude to Prudhoe Bay, where
it will enter the trans-Alaska pipeline. Pumps would be needed to
move the oil through the pipelines. The lines and pumps would have to
be maintained, requiring access roads that could be used in summer as
well as winter; otherwise, a fleet of helicopters would be constantly
buzzing over the plain.</TE>
<TE>   * The most recent and authoritative estimate is that 46,300 jobs
would be created nationwide, most of them temporary.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, Murkowski is really stretching the facts when he says
there may be between 5.6 billion and 16 billion barrels there. The
U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 3.2 billion barrels can be
economically recovered at current prices of about $20 a barrel. That
would meet the nation's needs for about six months.</TE>
<TE>   The big oil companies publicly support the Bush plan to open the
refuge. Privately, they are not nearly as enthusiastic about the
refuge's prospects. Experts say the companies are more interested in
developing fields elsewhere, in areas where the oil can be extracted
more easily and more cheaply.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's energy security does not depend on getting oil from
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Nor, as Murkowski implies, would
this liberate the U.S. from the ability of Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein to hold the United States hostage with his oil. U.S. reliance
on Persian Gulf oil is on the decline. Nearly half of the nation's
imports now come from within the Western Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Considering Bush's background in the oil business, and his
friendships with oil executives, it would be tempting to say he wants
to open the refuge as a favor to his buddies. But since even they are
not sure they want to drill there, his obsession is baffling.</TE>

<LD>After a prolonged and troubling silence, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony on
Monday accepted responsibility and apologized for the sins of the
small minority of priests that has brought shame to the Los Angeles
Archdiocese. At an extraordinary "Mass of reparations," the cardinal
said from now on the archdiocese will cooperate fully with law
enforcement when parishioners allege sexual abuse. But in adding that
he will not give police the names of priests accused of past sexual
crimes, he asks society to take an unacceptable leap of faith.</LD>
<LD>   When did the alleged abuse occur? Who stands accused? Are these
priests even now abusing teenagers and other children? Civil, not
religious, authorities need to answer these questions. Soon.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the scandals grow wider and uglier. Week by week across
the nation, new allegations of abuse against children leak out, and
last weekend Times staff writer Glenn F. Bunting reported that a monk
and a priest at a Jesuit retreat in Los Gatos had for at least five
years sexually abused two mentally disabled men.</LD>
<TE>   The Catholic Church is not by any means the only church in which
some clerics have abused their power and injured those they should be
comforting and protecting. But the institution stands alone for
having so spectacularly botched its handling of the decades-old
problem.</TE>
<TE>   We encourage Catholic leaders to put aside sectarian pride and
learn from the Episcopalians, who have taken a much more aggressive
approach to sexual abuse by the clergy. The key is openness. If a
parishioner makes a credible charge of abuse against an Episcopal
priest, that church, under a written policy, passes the information
on to the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Catholic Church, faced with what may be its
gravest crisis in modern history, has followed the bad example set by
large corporations that keep information about dangerous products
secret by demanding confidentiality agreements in their legal
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday Mahony said he would support victims of past sexual
abuse who want to break such legal deals and talk. We encourage
victims of abuse to do so and to cooperate fully with civil
authorities to make sure that bad priests don't harm others.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, belatedly, the Catholic Church is getting the message.
Modern seminaries now work not just to shape incoming priests'
spirituality but to bolster their emotional maturity and give them a
clear sense of social responsibility. To fully redeem itself,
however, the church must turn over to prosecutors the name of every
cleric accused of abuse and leave it to civil authorities to decide
whether more investigation is warranted. The wall separating church
and state was never meant to be a veil of secrecy to protect
criminals.</TE>

<LD>Re "L.A. in Future Perfect Tense," Commentary, March 25: Bill
Boyarsky's historical knowledge of Los Angeles seems to stretch back
to the "old maps of a city founded in 1781," but he seems to have
missed the fact that neither the San Fernando Valley nor the Los
Angeles harbor were part of that map until about 130 years later.
When the Valley was annexed, L.A.'s population was 10% of what it is
now. The city has now grown beyond its means, beyond its control,
beyond its governance.</LD>
<LD>   Reader letters express concern that Los Angeles and a new Valley
city won't have the political clout currently enjoyed with state and
federal officials. But news media aren't splitting by political
boundaries. L.A. will remain influential as the No. 2 media market in
the country behind New York. Even as separate cities, my estimates
are that Los Angeles would still be the third most populous city in
the nation, followed by the new San Fernando Valley city at No. 4.
Ask the current third-ranking city, Chicago, if it doesn't have
influence.</LD>
<LD>   There will be little or no change in influence or culture should
the San Fernando Valley secede from its parent city. The difference
will be smaller, more localized government that will provide more
control to local residents over issues such as zoning, development
and spending.</LD>
<TE>   While Los Angeles may have given birth to the Valley's
incorporation and growth 87 years ago, it was only as part of a
scheme to bring water to the area and to fill the pockets of rich and
influential Valley landowners. We are now mature enough to grow from
being the city's stepchild to a self-supporting life of our own.</TE>

<LD>Re "South Africa Shouldn't Have to Go Tougher on Mugabe," Commentary,
March 20: Why does it matter that President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
may have been perceived as more pro-Western than his chief political
opponent when he assumed power over 20 years ago? The pressing issue
today is that his government has systematically violated human
rights, shattered the rule of law and, by most observers' accounts,
stolen the recent presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   This commentary suggests that some view the Movement for
Democratic Change with suspicion because white Zimbabweans, less than
1% of the population, support it. What distinguishes the political
opposition in Zimbabwe for many others is its admirable commitment to
nonviolence in the face of violent government attack, though it is
worth noting that a few white MDC parliamentarians have won election
in overwhelmingly black constituencies, which represent unique acts
of racial reconciliation. The victims of government violence in
Zimbabwe, by the way, are overwhelmingly black.</LD>
<TE>   No one is looking to "punish" South Africa. The Mugabe government
has already done that by its economic mismanagement and by creating a
political cloud over the region that has driven away foreign
investment. What many South Africans themselves hope for (made clear
in the lively South African press) is that their government honors
its democratic principles by vocally condemning Mugabe's tyranny
north of its border.</TE>
<TE>   Having suffered through apartheid, South Africans know the power
of principled international criticism in challenging oppression.</TE>

<HD>Dorothy DeLay, 84; Taught Many Noted Violinists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorothy DeLay, teacher and mentor to some of the world's most
celebrated violinists, died Sunday at her home in Upper Nyack, N.Y.,
after a more than yearlong battle with cancer. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   DeLay's long teaching career spanned two generations of players.
Her students included violinists Itzhak Perlman, Midori, Cho-Liang
Lin, Gil Shaham, Schlomo Mintz and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg. Other
pupils, such as Joseph Swenson and Peter Oundjian, went on to become
conductors. Her violinists have joined the Juilliard, Cleveland,
Tokyo and Fine Arts quartets.</LD>
<LD>   At the Juilliard School of Music, where she taught for half a
century, students clutching violins would line up for hours for the
chance to study with DeLay, whose students regularly snagged top
prizes at competitions, often a first step to the high-stakes concert
circuit.</LD>
<TE>   Parents called DeLay from all over the world, hoping she'd listen
for five minutes to their "brilliant" children and recognize them as
prodigies.</TE>
<TE>   They hoped lightning would strike as it did in 1986 for
then-6-year-old Sarah Chang, now one of classical music's hottest
properties. After listening to Chang play on her one-eighth-sized
violin, DeLay agreed to take her on as a student.</TE>
<TE>   Young violinists trained by DeLay were noted for a distinctive
sound that has been described as lush, burnished and beautiful</TE>
<TE>   "Dorothy DeLay represented the highest level of violin teaching
during the second half of the 20th century," said Joseph W. Polisi,
Juilliard president, in a statement. "Her legacy is reflected in the
thousands of violinists who are currently performing and teaching
around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Born March 31, 1917, in the cattle town of Medicine Lodge, Kan.,
DeLay had been described as looking more like a nice Midwestern
grandmother than a groomer of concert professionals.</TE>
<TE>   The stereotype of the stern, usually male European violin master
was flouted by the warm, nurturing DeLay--who, according to a 1989
story in the Los Angeles Times, often addressed her callers as
"Sweetie," "Honey" or "Sugarplum."</TE>
<TE>   She was given to offering homespun advice on romance or fashion in
counterpoint to her musical instruction. Her philosophy: "Teach the
student, not the subject."</TE>
<TE>   Even when their fame outstripped hers, many of her students
continued to call her "Miss DeLay."</TE>
<TE>   DeLay's teaching career began in 1947, when she was a student of
Ivan Galamian at Juilliard. At that time, she began accepting
invitations for part-time teaching and assistantships at the Henry
Street Settlement, Juilliard and Sarah Lawrence College. The
experience led her to realize that she enjoyed teaching more than
performing.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of music instructors, DeLay began playing violin at
age 4. At 16, she enrolled at the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio, then
transferred to Michigan State University after her parents insisted
that she broaden her education beyond music.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating in 1937, DeLay moved to New York to enroll in the
Juilliard School. She toured Latin America as a member of Leopold
Stokowski's All-American Youth Orchestra. At the end of that tour,
she met Edward Newhouse, a writer for the New Yorker, on a
cross-country train journey. They married in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   DeLay's concert career was interrupted by World War II, when
Newhouse was transferred to a series of Army Air Corps bases before
they settled in New York. DeLay returned to Juilliard in 1946, where
she began studying with Galamian.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1960s, however, differences in teaching philosophy
began to drive a wedge between them. In 1970, their relationship
ended abruptly when Galamian demanded that Juilliard students working
with both teachers choose between them. Perlman, for one, chose
DeLay.</TE>
<TE>   After the bitter split, DeLay began to gain recognition in her own
right. She was the first woman to be considered a master violin
teacher in the tradition of Galamian and Leopold Auer.</TE>
<TE>   DeLay remained at Juilliard for the rest of her career, and was
director of the school's Starling-DeLay Institute, whose aim is to
find and develop new artist-teachers of the violin.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her husband; two children, Alison Dinsmore of
Boston and Jeffrey Newhouse of Bronxville, N.Y.; and four
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Gonzalo Duran, 78; Crafted Footwear for Latin Dancers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gonzalo Duran, an immigrant shoemaker who during four decades built a
loyal clientele among flamenco and folklorico dancers by making
custom-fit footwear from his home shop in Boyle Heights, died Friday
in Los Angeles of heart failure. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Duran was considered part of a dying breed of craftsmen, cutting
leather by hand with his scarred and callused fingers like an Old
World cobbler. Although he had suffered from kidney failure and
endured regular dialysis treatments since September, he kept working
in his small, cluttered shop until he was hospitalized with a
bleeding ulcer a week before his death.</LD>
<LD>   "All the dancers in town--and I mean literally all the
dancers--are going to be devastated, because he's the only one we
use," said Carolina Russek of Los Angeles, a professional dancer and
instructor who has worn and recommended Duran's shoes for 30 years.
"It's going to be a loss for the entire dance community."</LD>
<TE>   The diminutive shoemaker carved a market niche for himself by
catering to the special needs of Mexican and Spanish dancers, drawing
customers from as far away as Fresno and Santa Barbara. But he also
took custom orders for theatrical costumes and celebrities such as
Michael Flatley, the "Lord of the Dance."</TE>
<TE>   Duran was born in 1923 in Parral, Chihuahua, Mexico, which he
frequently and fondly called "the world's most civilized city" for
its orderliness. When he was a child, his family moved to Rosario,
Durango, which he recalled had no electricity, no running water and
no doctor.</TE>
<TE>   At 12, he left school to work in his father's home shoe shop,
learning the trade he would practice the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Duran lived for a time in Juarez, where he made cowboy boots, then
moved to California in 1954. He said he decided to go into business
here after receiving rude treatment from a clerk at a shoe store.</TE>
<TE>   With his own clients, he put a premium on pleasing his customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make shoes exactly the way they want them," he said.
"Since I don't charge very much, the customer leaves happy. And
that's what makes me happy."</TE>
<TE>   Duran is survived by his wife of 59 years, Isabel; a son, Gonzalo
Jr.; and two daughters, Isabel II of Los Angeles and Marguerite of
Van Nuys. He also leaves his father, Francisco, 103, of Juarez, and
five siblings.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral Mass is scheduled for 9 a.m. today at St. Mary Catholic
Church in Boyle Heights. Interment will be at Forest Lawn Cemetery in
Glendale.</TE>

<HD>Richard Sylbert, 73; Film Set Designer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard "Dick" Sylbert, a two-time Academy Award-winning production
designer who evoked 1930s Los Angeles in "Chinatown," the cartoon
world of "Dick Tracy" and the looks of more than 40 other memorable
films in a five-decade career, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Sylbert died Saturday of cancer at the Motion Picture &amp; Television
Fund hospital in Woodland Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Known for his devotion to historical accuracy as well as his
inventiveness, he earned six Academy Award nominations and won his
two best art direction Oscars for Mike Nichols' "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf" in 1966 and Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Sylbert received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the
Society of Motion Picture and Television Art Directors for his
illustrious body of work.</TE>
<TE>   Among the films that received the Sylbert touch: "Baby Doll"
(1956), "Splendor in the Grass" (1961), "Long Day's Journey Into
Night" (1962), "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962), "The Graduate"
(1967), "Rosemary's Baby" (1968), "Carnal Knowledge" (1971),
"Chinatown" (1974), "Shampoo" (1975), "Reds" (1981), "The Cotton
Club" (1984) and "My Best Friend's Wedding" (1997).</TE>
<TE>   "He was the production designer of the last Golden Age of
Hollywood, the '70s," said Peter Biskind, author of a book on the
era, "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and Rock 'n' Roll
Generation Saved Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   "Richard more than any production designer I've worked with gave a
definitive look and feel to a movie," said director John
Frankenheimer. "He was a true collaborator in every sense of the
word."</TE>
<TE>   Frankenheimer said the famous 360-degree shot in "The Manchurian
Candidate" from "the hotel lobby in New Jersey with the ladies
talking about the garden club to the amphitheater in Manchuria with
the psychiatrist talking about the garden club--that was all Richard,
his design. I told him what I wanted and he figured out how to do it.
His production design was total production design."</TE>
<TE>   As a production designer, Sylbert was responsible for the overall
look of a movie: sets, locations and props--details that create the
atmosphere of a film.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has any trouble understanding what a costume designer
does," Sylbert told The Times in 1990. "But 'production design' is a
title without any definition. I tell people that, just as a painter
organizes pigment and a musician organizes noise, a production
designer organizes visual material."</TE>
<TE>   For a production designer, the art is in the details.</TE>
<TE>   For a single shot of a home library in "Without a Trace," Sylbert
instructed the set decorator to purchase 300 books, from Harvard
classics to feminist Georgian poets, so the audience would believe
the bookshelves belonged to an English teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Biskind wrote that one of Sylbert's strengths was to "boil down a
script into one or two visual metaphors that express the essence of
the movie."</TE>
<TE>   In "Chinatown," for example, all the buildings are white to
reflect heat and underscore the film's plot about drought.</TE>
<TE>   As Sylbert once said: "Our craft is not about pointing at a
building and saying, 'That will do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn in 1928, Sylbert and his twin, Paul--an
Oscar-winning production designer for "Heaven Can Wait"--were
inseparable. They served in the same Army infantry unit in Korea and
attended Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to New York, Sylbert, who had received formal
training as a painter, landed a job painting scenery at NBC; Paul
worked at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, Sylbert became art director on the syndicated TV series
"The Inner Sanctum." In 1956, he served as art director on his first
feature film, "Patterns." The same year, he teamed with his brother
as art director on Elia Kazan's "Baby Doll." Together they developed
techniques for making movies look more realistic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Sylbert, who had been associate producer on the 1965
romantic farce "What's New Pussycat?" replaced Robert Evans as vice
president in charge of production at Paramount, the first and only
time a production designer ever became head of production at a major
studio.</TE>
<TE>   "I was as impressed with Richard's brilliant literary mind as his
production design mind, [so] I made him head of production of the
studio when I resigned," Evans said. "It was because of his knowledge
of material and the people he'd worked with and knew who respected
him."</TE>
<TE>   The pipe-smoking Sylbert, who had a penchant for wearing khaki
pants and a khaki jacket with a belt, is described by his friends as
having been brutally honest, scathingly funny and extremely
well-read.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick was always logical, he was unpretentious, he was
no-nonsense," recalled Beatty. "I was interested in his opinion on
everything to do with the movie."</TE>
<TE>   During his three years on the job at Paramount, Sylbert was
responsible for making "Looking for Mr. Goodbar," "Bad News Bears,"
"Bugsy Malone," "The Tenant" and other hits.</TE>
<TE>   But his heart was in production design. He left Paramount in 1978
and a few years later earned his fourth Oscar nomination, for Warren
Beatty's 1981 movie "Reds."</TE>
<TE>   Sylbert also worked occasionally in television. He designed the
barroom set for the TV series "Cheers" and earned an Emmy nomination
for an episode.</TE>
<TE>   He also designed the set for the Broadway production of Neil
Simon's "The Prisoner of Second Avenue."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his brother, Sylbert is survived by his wife of 17
years, Sharmagne; sons Douglas, Jon and Mark; daughters Lulu and
Daisy; and one grandchild.</TE>

<LD>You'd think that having a judge on the ballot who's charged with
molestation and possessing kiddie porn wouldn't generate much comic
material. Kind of off-limits, yes?</LD>
<LD>   O ye of little faith.</LD>
<LD>   Didn't we learn long ago that, when it comes to public officials
and their pronouncements, there's no limit to their gift for the
absurd? For the well-turned phrase? And, most important, for their
willingness to perform?</LD>
<TE>   And so, even with as delicate a matter as Superior Court Judge
Ronald Kline's ongoing legal problems, we're continually entertained
by Comedy Central, otherwise known as Orange County's administrative
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The star of this week's show is Supervisor Todd Spitzer. I've been
a Spitzer man since he joined the board in 1997, liking the way his
brashness sometimes rattled the bureaucratic cages. The man has made
me chuckle more than once with his timely barbs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, until this week I had no appreciation for his grasp of
deadpan humor.</TE>
<TE>   This, ladies and gentlemen, is a gifted artist.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisor has said with straight-faced insistence that he
wants Judge Kline's name to remain on the November ballot. The judge,
charged in December after he'd filed for reelection, says he is
innocent but recently asked that his name be removed because it's the
honorable thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it's not that Spitzer wants to vote for the accused jurist.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, it's that he can't wait to vote against him. And
he wants everyone else in Orange County to have the same chance.</TE>
<TE>   "The public deserves the right to throw him out of office if they
choose."</TE>
<TE>   That's what the man said. I must find out if he writes his own
material.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer took pains to say he only wants to follow the law, which
says that a candidate can't have his name removed from the ballot
unless he dies or is elected to another office.</TE>
<TE>   That's what is known in comedy as misdirection.</TE>
<TE>   What Spitzer really wants is for establishment candidate John
Adams, the top vote-getter from a large cast of write-in candidates
(and also Spitzer's choice), to run against Kline in November. You'd
have to like Adams' chances in that race.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline's name is dropped, local election officials still aren't
certain whether Adams would then square off against the next-highest
vote-getter among the write-ins. Adams would still be the favorite,
but his election would be less assured.</TE>
<TE>   Adams spoke out early in opposing Kline's removal from the ballot,
yet apparently came to realize how self-serving that sounded. The way
these things work, the job of keeping Kline on the ballot has fallen
to others.</TE>
<TE>   Such as Spitzer, who leaped into the breach. The other
supervisors, although not voting to dive into the Kline matter, have
more or less followed Spitzer's lead.</TE>
<TE>   That's where things stand now. A hearing is scheduled for next
week on Kline's request to have his name removed.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, we're asked to believe that people who adamantly
opposed Kline's continuing in office now adamantly oppose his
decision to take his name off the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Because that would insult our intelligence, Spitzer is left to
argue that the judge is bending the law by wanting off the ballot.
The public, he says, deserves the chance to oust Kline--as if society
is nagged with doubt over whether it wants accused molesters and
kiddie porn fans to be judges.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the supervisor has played out his little comic bit.
What if Spitzer's argument holds sway and Kline remains on the
ballot? And then is elected?</TE>
<TE>   Now, that's funny.</TE>
<TE>   I have only one suggestion for Spitzer, Adams and whoever else is
in on this Kline production:</TE>
<TE>   Respect your audience. When you're doing comedy, play it as
comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Don't try to pass it off as serious drama.</TE>

<HD>Cooley Urges Reports of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Catholics: In a letter to the archdiocese, district
attorney asks church to comply with state law and turn in any priests
suspected of crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley urged the Roman Catholic
archdiocese to comply with state law and give any suspicions of child
abuse by its priests to police or child welfare officials, according
to a letter released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In response to the March 13 letter he received from Cooley,
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony maintained that church officials in the Los
Angeles region are abiding by the 1997 state law that requires such
reporting.</LD>
<LD>   "To the best of my knowledge, allegations of known or reasonably
suspected instances of child abuse or neglect were reported to the
appropriate agency at the time of the allegation in accord with the
California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act," the cardinal
wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The two letters were released by Cooley's office Tuesday. The
archdiocese could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's letter came after church sources revealed that six to 12
priests were removed recently from the Los Angeles archdiocese
because of allegations of sexual abuse against minors. Cooley said he
has not been able to confirm whether those cases were reported to
legal authorities. Cooley's letter explains that the law requires
clergy to report by phone immediately and by writing within 36 hours
any reasonable suspicions of child abuse, including sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney offered the help of his office in handling
the sensitive matters, similar cases of which have caused painful
reviews within the Catholic Church nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, in his letter of reply, thanked Cooley for the offer to
help the archdiocese. The cardinal repeated a segment of his March 10
letter to parishioners across Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura
counties that emphasized the obligation of clergy to report abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The law allows, however, exceptions for reporting by clergy if the
claim of sexual abuse is made during a confession or if an adult who
was victimized as a child is capable of making the report.</TE>
<TE>   "We urge everyone with knowledge of child abuse to go to police.
We need to take the predators off the street," said Sandi Gibbons, a
spokeswoman for Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony told 300 Catholic priests Monday that he would support
victims of long-ago sexual abuse who want to break confidentiality
agreements and talk, but he said the archdiocese would not release
the names of their abusers.</TE>
<TE>   The release of abusers' names from many years ago would further
harm victims, he said. When new cases of abuse arise, he said, the
names of priests removed for sexual misconduct will be announced to
parishioners, Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the few recent dismissals stem from incidents many years
ago and said some of those involved went to jail but he did not offer
any details.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal apologized during the mass for "the sinful and
deplorable actions of a small percentage of priests" and said he has
adopted a zero-tolerance policy.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference afterward, Mahony said church officials are
cooperating with police and cited a tip to an archdiocese hotline
that led to the dismissal last week of a priest as head of a Catholic
high school in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' advocates took issue Tuesday with Mahony's position on
not releasing names in old cases.</TE>
<TE>   "My experience with victims is once a molester is named, more
victims come out of the woodwork," said Kathy Freberg, an attorney
for clergy abuse victims. "It is far easier to come forward when you
are not alone. Cardinal Mahony fears more victims."</TE>

<HD>Church's Scandal Starts With Celibacy</HD>

<LD>On my way to hear Cardinal Roger Mahony speak in Long Beach Monday
night, I stopped to visit a Catholic priest who thinks the greater
church's response to the nationwide sex abuse scandal is all wrong.</LD>
<LD>   "What amazes and dismays me," the priest had said in an e-mail,
"is that bishops appear to believe that with stricter policies alone
... the issue can be taken care of in a timely fashion. I believe the
issue is much, much larger."</LD>
<LD>   Father Frederick, as I'll call him, greeted me at his residence in
Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   "In Africa," he said, "nuns are being sexually abused by priests.
In other parts of the world, concubinage is a practice among
priests." In the United States, clergy abuse of children has gone on
for generations.</TE>
<TE>   And the connection?</TE>
<TE>   "These are all issues of human sexuality," Father Frederick said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course they are, and the church does not discuss sexuality in
any way other than to regurgitate its own outdated policies.</TE>
<TE>   "On marriage, abortion, contraception and homosexuality, we don't
deal with the fact that millions of people don't comply with church
teachings," Father Frederick said. "We're not addressing the real
circumstances of people's lives and the impact of these teachings."</TE>
<TE>   About halfway through our discussion, Father Frederick told me
he's gay. A vast number of his colleagues are gay, too, he said. "I'd
say at least 10%."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you don't go around telling people you're gay if you're
a priest. It's another sexual reality the church prefers not to
acknowledge, let alone discuss.</TE>
<TE>   There is no known connection between homosexuality and pedophilia,
by the way. But among those attracted to the priesthood are straight
and gay people who haven't dealt with or don't understand their own
sexuality. And once they're in, they're required to suppress powerful
natural urges for the rest of their lives. If you were actually
trying to create a laboratory for sexual dysfunction, you couldn't do
better than this.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Father Frederick if it's time for the church to reconsider
the celibacy vow and let priests marry, and he grinned before
answering.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it obvious?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Yes. To everyone but the pope.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that I can't tell you Father Frederick's real name is
half the story. The last Orange County priest who spoke to me about
reform got sent to Canada. So Father Frederick has no idea what exile
might await him for talking openly.</TE>
<TE>   Why stick around? I asked him.</TE>
<TE>   Because despite its flaws, Father Frederick said, he cares deeply
about the church and would like to see it advance into the current
century.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of what he had to say reminded me of my conversations with
Richard Sipe, a former priest now living in La Jolla with his wife
and family.</TE>
<TE>   "The church's understanding of human sexuality is inadequate at
best and false at worst," says Sipe, who has written books on the
subject and has been an expert witness in dozens of sex abuse cases
involving priests.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus Christ never said anything about masturbation or
contraception, and the moral reasoning the church uses to establish
[its] teaching is not only ephemeral, it's false. It does not fit
with what we know scientifically about human nature."</TE>
<TE>   By dusk on Monday, Our Lady of Refuge in Long Beach was packed pew
to parking lot. Three hundred priests at the "Mass of reparations"
heard Cardinal Mahony say the sins of a few had soiled the
reputations of hundreds. Actually, it was the refusal of church
leaders to come clean--here and elsewhere--that raised suspicion and
shattered trust.</TE>
<TE>   In the news conference after Mass, I asked Mahony why several
priests were only recently dismissed if he's had a zero-tolerance
policy in place for more than a decade. He spoke, but he didn't get
close to answering. This gives me something in common with L.A.
County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, who sent a letter to Mahony asking
him to share what he knows.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Father Frederick had said, the church's problems extend
far beyond the specifics of child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   And so I asked Mahony if he were open to a kind of
self-examination that includes broader reforms, such as letting
priests marry. Given that Mahony is probably the most powerful
cardinal in America, and that the Vatican does not operate a
democracy, I thought I knew the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all these questions are open; I never said they should
not be raised," Mahony said, keeping me off balance, contradicting
Pope John Paul II, and giving Father Frederick a measure of hope.</TE>

<DH>Wildlife: Five of the mammals wash ashore. The toxin
afflicting dolphins is suspected.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California sea lions are the latest marine mammals to wash ashore on
Southland beaches. Since Sunday, five pregnant sea lions have been
found disoriented and having seizures on beaches in Los Angeles and
Ventura counties.</LD>
<LD>   The two that survived were being cared for Tuesday at the Fort
MacArthur Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro. The lethargic,
200-pound marine mammals were lying in their pens, disoriented and
too weak to eat. They're being force-fed ground-up fish as well as
medicine, vitamins and electrolytes.</LD>
<LD>   Center officials believe a naturally occurring neurotoxin that is
blooming off the coast between Monterey and San Luis Obispo is
responsible for the sickness. The scientists suspect the sea lions
ate fish that contained the toxin in that area but became ill in
Southern California waters. Domoic acid is found in a single-cell,
plant-like organism. Low levels are always present, but blooms can
create toxic levels. The microscopic organisms are eaten by the
sardines, anchovies and other small fish that sea lions feast on,
said center director Jackie Jaakola.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 34 sea lions that have washed ashore in Los Angeles and
Ventura counties this year, officials suspect half suffered from
domoic acid poisoning. Typically, such cases are seen in late summer
or early fall, and experts aren't sure why there have been so many in
the winter and spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Something is going on out there," Jaakola said, gesturing toward
the Pacific Ocean.The sea lion sickness is giving new weight to the
theory that domoic acid may have caused the deaths of 23 dolphins
found on Southern California beaches in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to be having the same symptoms, they're from the same
body of water and there's some overlap in their food," said John
Heyning, deputy director for research at the Natural History Museum
of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Domoic acid was recognized as a health hazard in 1987, when 150
people became ill and four died from eating contaminated blue mussels
on Prince Edward Island, Canada. It was blamed in the deaths of 100
brown pelicans and cormorants in Monterey Bay in 1991, and 50 sea
lions between San Luis Obispo and Santa Cruz in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists believe bird attacks near Santa Cruz in 1961--upon
which Alfred Hitchcock's horror movie "The Birds" is based--were
caused by birds eating fish that contained high levels of domoic
acid.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never recorded it in dolphins before," Heyning said. "With
sea lions getting it, it makes [the theory] even stronger because we
have documented its effects on sea lions."</TE>
<TE>   Results from tests of dolphin tissue and brain at government
laboratories in South Carolina and Washington, D.C., should be
available by the end of the week, he said. If the link is proved,
scientists will test archived tissue samples from an unexplained
dolphin die-off in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Jaakola said the center has sent sea lion samples to federal labs
but hasn't received results. She said her experience with similar
cases leads her to conclude that the sea lions were poisoned by
domoic acid.</TE>
<TE>   If the sick animals survive the first 48 hours, chances are good
they'll recover and be released within a few months to give birth in
the wild. But federal officials say the sea lions have only about a
50% chance of making it through that crucial early period.</TE>
<TE>   Jaakola advises beachgoers who see a stranded sea lion to call a
local animal control agency. Beachgoers should not approach or touch
the animal because it might lash out. "These are very disoriented,
aggressive, pregnant females," she said. "You don't want to be around
them."</TE>

<HD>Clear Winners in L.A. Redistricting Plan</HD>
<DH>City Council: Committee endorses boundaries giving Latino
and Valley voters more sway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latinos and the San Fernando Valley would gain seats and clout on the
Los Angeles City Council under a redistricting plan that a city
commission voted Tuesday to send to the council.</LD>
<LD>   The plan to redraw the 15 council districts would give Latinos a
plurality in five districts, compared with four currently. The plan
would maintain three districts in which African American voters
constitute a plurality, the same as at present.</LD>
<LD>   Recognizing that much of the city's population growth recorded in
the 2000 census was in the northern part of the city, the new plan
also would increase, from four to five, the number of council
districts wholly in the Valley.</LD>
<TE>   "These are very significant changes," said John Emerson, chairman
of the Los Angeles Redistricting Commission, which voted to recommend
the plan to the council. "To have one-third of the council districts
wholly in the Valley and one-third predominantly comprised of Latino
residents reflects the demographic trends in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is expected to approve a final plan by July 1.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 people attended Tuesday's hearing, including six
council members who argued for boundary changes that would benefit
their districts.</TE>
<TE>   There was controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In order to create another district entirely within the Valley,
the commission moved the 6th District, now representing the Westside,
to the East Valley. Venice Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who will be
forced out of the 6th District next year by term limits, would
represent new constituents in the Valley until then.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, much of Galanter's old district will be merged
into a reconfigured 11th Council District, which will include much of
the coastal area from West Los Angeles to Westchester and be
represented by Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter had sought to represent the coastal district, arguing
that the plan disenfranchises those who voted for her. She may ask
the council to delay implementing the new district boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski's term expires in three years. Had she been assigned
to the 6th District instead of Galanter, Valley voters would be
without representation by a council member of their own choosing for
that period.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the 1st, 7th, 13th, 14th and new 6th districts
would all have about 40% Latino voter registration or more, giving
that ethnic community a plurality of voters.</TE>
<TE>   The California Latino Redistricting Coalition will review the map
eventually approved by the City Council to make sure Latino voter
registration is not diluted, according to Chairman Alan Clayton. If
any of those five districts fall below 40% Latino voter registration,
it might result in a Voting Rights Act complaint with the U.S.
Justice Department, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If properly drawn, the plan would give the city's growing Latino
population the greater clout it deserves, Clayton said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have one-third of the council seats, Latinos would have a
major influence on major policy decisions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley
VOTE, said the new plan is a mixed blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are finally getting what we are entitled to," Close said,
crediting the threat of Valley secession with creating incentive for
the change. Commissioners, including Emerson, said the secession
issue played a role in convincing the panel that the Valley needed
better representation.</TE>
<TE>   "It does improve the Valley's clout somewhat," Close said.
"However, having a non-Valley councilperson represent part of the
Valley for the next year--I'm not sure how that helps."</TE>
<TE>   Even if five Valley districts are created, about 200,000 Valley
residents would be left over, to be divided between two other
districts. Close argued unsuccessfully that all 200,000 be placed in
one district. Currently, three districts include small portions of
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Another battle Tuesday was over a proposal by Councilman Nick
Pacheco to extend his 14th District to represent more of downtown. He
wanted the area generally east of Grand Avenue. Ninth District
Councilwoman Jan Perry fought successfully to keep representing most
of downtown, forcing the panel to leave a decision on Pacheco's
proposal to the council.</TE>
<TE>   The commission rejected a last-minute proposal by Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas to move LAX from the coastal district into his 8th
Council District, after several Westchester residents protested the
split of their community.</TE>
<TE>   The plan does seek to keep communities of interest together, so
that, for instance, Van Nuys, which is currently split among five
districts, would be divided between two in the new plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel pretty comfortable what we came up with is a vast
improvement over what exists now in terms of keeping communities of
interest together," Emerson said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission voted to recommend the new plan after more than 50
hours of public hearings all over Los Angeles at which more than
1,000 people testified.</TE>

<HD>'One Strike' Eviction Policy Affirmed</HD>
<DH>Law: Justices agree that even innocent tenants can be
removed from public housing over others' drug activity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court upheld the government's strict "one strike and
you're out" policy Tuesday for residents of public housing, ruling
that even innocent tenants can be evicted if a family member or guest
is caught with drugs on or near a housing project.</LD>
<LD>   In a unanimous decision on a case filed by a group of tenants from
Oakland, the justices said Congress was entitled to adopt a
zero-tolerance policy to rid public housing of drugs and crime.</LD>
<LD>   Tenants who are caught with drugs in their apartments are subject
to eviction, even for a first-time offense. Moreover, an entire
family can be evicted if one person is caught with drugs--even if the
offender is blocks away and if the head of the household knew nothing
of the wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   An injunction had allowed the elderly tenants from Oakland to
remain in their units with the case pending. But three of the renters
now face eviction because of drug use by relatives and, in one case,
a caretaker.</TE>
<TE>   Willie Lee, a 75-year-old disabled grandmother, said she does not
know where she will go. She emerged from her unit long enough Tuesday
to issue a statement, saying: "I didn't do anything wrong. And I
don't want to be homeless."</TE>
<TE>   Lee's grandson was caught smoking marijuana in a nearby parking
lot.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the "strict liability"
policy serves two useful purposes: It puts all tenants on notice they
can be removed if they do not prevent drug use by their family
members. And it protects law-abiding families from crime and violence
in the projects.</TE>
<TE>   Drug users and drug crime are "a threat to other residents and the
[housing] project," Rehnquist said. "With drugs leading to murders,
muggings and other forms of violence against tenants ... it was
reasonable for Congress to permit no-fault evictions in order to
provide ... low-income housing that is decent, safe and free from
illegal drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist also said that nothing in the Constitution prevents
public housing authorities from enforcing this policy. Tenants are on
notice of the rule because it is written into their lease, he pointed
out.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling marked the latest clash between the liberal
federal appeals court in California and the more conservative Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the
four Oakland tenants.</TE>
<TE>   The mentally disabled daughter of Pearlie Rucker, 63, was found
with cocaine three blocks from her mother's apartment. (Oakland
officials later revoked Rucker's eviction after her daughter was
arrested and removed from her home.)</TE>
<TE>   Like grandmother Willie Lee, Barbara Hill, 63, faces eviction
because her grandson was caught smoking marijuana in a nearby parking
lot.</TE>
<TE>   In-Home Care Worker May Cost Stroke Victim</TE>
<TE>   Herman Walker, a 78-year-old stroke victim, could also lose his
home because his in-home care worker was found with drug
paraphernalia, said Anne Tamiko Omura, an attorney with the Eviction
Defense Center in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Walker spent part of the day Tuesday at the hospital and had tired
of talking to reporters about his case, Omura said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of Justice Stephen
Breyer, handed down an order blocking the evictions of the Oakland
tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Upholding his order, the 9th Circuit judges set out an "innocent
tenants" exception to the eviction policy. Housing authorities may
not oust tenants who "did not know or have any reason to know" of the
illegal drug activity by their family members or friends, the appeals
court said on a 7-4 vote.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court agreed to hear the joint appeals filed by
the U.S. Department of Housing and the Oakland Housing Authority (HUD
vs. Rucker, 00-1770).</TE>
<TE>   With Justice Breyer recused from the case, his colleagues voted 8
to 0 to reverse the appeals court and reject the "innocent tenants"
exception.</TE>
<TE>   Pleased with the outcome, housing officials said they need the
authority to evict crime-ridden families. Eviction is not automatic,
but depends on the circumstances, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at each incident on a case-by-case basis. We do not
immediately kick out someone until we know all the circumstances,"
said Gary Lafayette, a lawyer for the Oakland Public Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal regulations, all public housing offices put clauses
in leases that warn tenants they can be evicted for drugs or criminal
activity, he said. "The true beneficiaries are individuals who live
in public housing and want to see the drugs and criminal activity
eradicated," Lafayette said. "They are the truly innocent tenants."</TE>
<TE>   However, the San Francisco lawyer who represented the tenants
facing eviction questioned whether it is fair or wise to punish a
person who has done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "This may sound fine in the abstract, but what sense does it make
if a 67-year-old woman is in danger of losing her home because she
took in her grandchild and the child did something wrong?" said Paul
Renne, a lawyer for three of the plaintiffs. "This seems to say
again: If you're poor and drugs are involved, anything goes."</TE>
<TE>   In several friend-of-the court briefs, advocates for poor and
abused women said these evictions of "innocent tenants" are
surprisingly common.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a single mother of two children in Marietta, Ga., was
evicted from her housing after authorities discovered a trace of
marijuana in her apartment. The woman, Nena Allen, said she knew
nothing about the marijuana, but discovered later that it had been
left there by a weekend guest.</TE>
<TE>   Battered Women Ousted Over Boyfriends' Crimes</TE>
<TE>   In other instances, battered or abused women have been evicted
because of the criminal activity by boyfriends. In Los Angeles, the
Housing Authority said it has removed about 300 tenants under the
"one-strike" policy, more than half for drug-related problems. The
agency could not say how many of those tenants were ousted because of
their own actions, or because a relative or acquaintance was caught
using drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of such cases can vary. Los Angeles housing officials
cited an example of a grandmother who was removed from a housing
project because of drug crimes by a relative, but was relocated to a
senior housing center.</TE>
<TE>   The strict anti-drug policy upheld Tuesday has a long political
lineage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Congress said public housing agencies must revise their
leases to say that any drug-related criminal activity "on or near"
such premises by the tenant, a member of the household or any guest
shall be cause for eviction.</TE>
<TE>   The administration of former President Bush put the policy into
effect in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Congress broadened the policy to cover drug activity "on
or off" the housing project premises. President Clinton announced the
"one strike and you're out" policy to enforce that law.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason in the world to put the rights of a criminal
before those of a child who wants to grow up safe ... in no danger of
being shot down in a gang war," Clinton said in 1996.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police, followed by a phalanx of media helicopters, chased a man
through the San Fernando Valley to Griffith Park on Tuesday after a
driver reported that the man had spit on him.</LD>
<LD>   The spit-upon driver, who admitted he had cut the man off, chased
the offender, and police joined because spitting is a battery, Sgt.
Mike Patriquin said.</LD>
<LD>   As the suspect's car headed toward congested intersections, police
called off the chase from the ground, but continued from the air.</LD>
<TE>   An hour after the pursuit began, police stopped David Smith, 43,
of West Hills, after he got out of his car and ran through Griffith
Park.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith was not the spitter, police said. The spitter got away,
and police had been chasing an SUV similar to his. However, Smith was
booked on suspicion of driving with a suspended license, evading
police and speeding from the scene of an accident. He struck another
car during the chase, police said.</TE>

<HD>Pupils Shunted to Vocational Ed Fear It Can Derail College
Dreams</HD>
<DH>Schools: Some students are placed against their wishes in
classes like cosmetology, auto shop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first, Leticia Paniagua thought her cosmetology class at Fremont
High School was fun. She learned how to manicure by removing nail
polish, pushing back cuticles and checking for hangnails. Other days
she learned thermal hair straightening or blow-drying techniques.</LD>
<LD>   But the 16-year-old sophomore, who hopes to attend USC and
become a brain surgeon, never wanted to be in the one-semester class. She
had asked for an academic elective like journalism that might help
her get into a college. Because enrollment was filled in the course
at the South-Central campus, her counselor placed her in cosmetology.</LD>
<LD>   She tried to transfer out, but it was too late. Now she is worried
that she might have to make up the credits required to be admitted to
a four-year university.</LD>
<TE>   Leticia is enrolled in one of six cosmetology or manicuring
classes offered at Fremont. Those classes and others, including
bank-telling, office work, floor-covering, computer technology and
auto shop, are among hundreds offered on Los Angeles Unified high
school campuses under the district's Regional Occupational Program.</TE>
<TE>   The program is designed to prepare youths for entry-level jobs in
technical, trade, office and service fields. Many educators praise
its success in teaching marketable skills and helping students attain
jobs after graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Others say some vocational classes offered through the program
serve as dumping grounds for students in overcrowded schools. In some
classes, as many as half the students are enrolled in vocational
classes because there are not enough teachers available to offer more
academic courses and electives.</TE>
<TE>   And with a shortage of counselors to give good advice, teens like
Leticia don't realize until too late that such vocational classes
will not help them get into a university.</TE>
<TE>   Counselors May Not Know Students' Names</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these students' decisions are made for them very, very
early on. Not by intention, but by default," said Jeannie Oakes, an
associate dean of the Graduate School of Education at UCLA, who has
written a book on inequalities in academic tracking. "These kids who
say their counselor just put them in this class, their counselor is
probably dealing with 600 to 700 kids and doesn't really even know
their name."</TE>
<TE>   The problem extends well outside L.A. Unified. In researching her
book, Oakes looked at urban school districts in 13 communities across
the nation and found a proliferation of vocational courses in schools
with poor and minority students compared with wealthier schools.
Also, wealthier students had access to better equipment and more
computer-based vocational courses than students in poorer
neighborhoods, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Katynja McCory, a director for the South Central Youth Empowered
Through Action community group, who has led protests against the
shortage of advanced placement classes in schools in poor areas, said
some of those same schools have an abundance of less challenging
vocational courses.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Locke High School in South-Central offers commercial
photography, sewing and office clerk courses through the Regional
Occupational Program. However, Palisades Charter Senior High School
offers Web page design, graphic animation and digital imaging.</TE>
<TE>   "Our students are being tracked into these low-wage careers,"
McCory said.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with hiring qualified teachers for college preparatory
classes, finding teachers for vocational classes is easier because
they are required to have only work-related credentials. Some of
those teachers are part-timers, and all are paid from a countywide
fund that is separate from the money for general K-12 classes. Also,
the program eases the space crunch by holding some classes off
campus.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when I would love to give them an art class if
that is their interest, but sometimes I just don't have the space for
them," said Lewis McCammon, an assistant principal and head counselor
at Belmont High School near downtown Los Angeles. "So when we have an
opportunity, like our banking classes, I make sure we get the
students into those classes."</TE>
<TE>   If enough students are not enrolled, those vocational courses
may be cut, causing the overall class shortage to become even worse. "If
I lose those classes, where am I going to put students?" he said.
"The other classes are packed."</TE>
<TE>   McCammon is a fan of Belmont's regional occupational courses,
which also include office work, computer repair and auto shop. Such
classes will not hurt college-bound students as long as they have
fulfilled college admission requirements, he says. Also, they can
gain a work ethic and learn investing or technical skills.</TE>
<TE>   Vocational Classes Can Be Handicaps</TE>
<TE>   But Walter Harris, associate director of admissions for Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo, said applicants who have taken one or more of such
classes are at a disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean they're not exceptional students, it just means
that in the pool of competition, they didn't have what the rest of
the pool had."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, a student who has taken auto shop or
floor-covering might lose out to another with British literature or
calculus.</TE>
<TE>   The occupational classes fulfill certain elective or technical
course requirements for Los Angeles Unified School District
graduation. But students need more than basic classes required for
graduation to be admitted to most UC campuses, said Hanan Eisenman, a
spokesman for admissions at the University of California.</TE>
<TE>   Unless a high school proves to college admissions officials that a
vocational course is academically challenging, such courses will not
help a student's chances, he said. Some computer courses offered
under the Regional Occupational Program, for example, may prepare
students for college-level work. But other classes, such as
cosmetology and floor-covering, may not, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The district spends about $9 million a year on the Regional
Occupational Program, which enrolls about 17,300 students, including
a few adults. Enrollment has grown by an average of 10% each year
since 1999 as more schools request more classes, said Jean Batey,
principal of the program.</TE>
<TE>   She said most students are placed in the classes because they want
them, instead of being forced into them.</TE>
<TE>   "The value of vocational training is that students are able to
actually attain some employable skills," she said. "Some who opt not
to go to college can leave high school and continue on into
vocational schools, entry-level positions or work their way into
four-year colleges."</TE>
<TE>   No Room for Them Elsewhere</TE>
<TE>   Batey conceded, however that some students are assigned to the
classes because there is no room for them elsewhere. "Realistically,
we know things like that happen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that most freshmen and sophomores are not allowed to
take regional occupational classes because they need to fulfill other
course requirements first.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Irvin, a counselor at Fremont High School, said he
discourages college-bound students from taking classes such as
cosmetology or sewing.</TE>
<TE>   If they wind up with such classes, they should see their counselor
to find something different, he said. "A 16- or 17-year-old who has
been in high school two years already should know how to" request
another class.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning in Dwight Organ's bank-teller class at Belmont
High, 30 students listened to an audiotape recording about the life
of a reformed criminal. Lessons of the day were written on the board,
including: Learn how criminals pass bad checks and define "crimes of
opportunity." Organ teaches students how to create resumes, interview
for jobs, stay out of debt, invest money and deal with customers.
Last year, 40 of his students were hired in banks after completing
the class.</TE>
<TE>   "The thrill for me is when I see a student come back and say, 'Mr.
Organ, I got my first job.'"</TE>
<TE>   But not all students in the class want to become bank-tellers. One
example is 17-year-old Richie Espinoza. He wants to attend UCLA to
become a teacher or a writer, but the senior with a 3.2 grade-point
average does not have the required classes to attend the university.</TE>
<TE>   Part of it is his fault, he concedes, for not protesting or
planning his course load early enough.</TE>
<TE>   Richie said he has learned a lot about the economy and job-hunting
in the class, but he would rather have taken an elective like
journalism, debate or creative writing. None, however, was offered at
the time, he said, and a counselor enrolled him in bank-telling.</TE>
<TE>   Now, his plan is to attend a community college and transfer to
UCLA later.</TE>
<TE>   Parents' Protest Brought Results</TE>
<TE>   Israel Alvarado, 17, was first placed in an office clerk class,
where he filed and learned data entry. After his parents protested,
counselors gave him the more challenging bank-telling, said Israel.
The course so influenced him that he now hopes to work for Bank of
America and study finance in college.</TE>
<TE>   But more than half of the students enrolled--many of whom want to
attend universities--did not choose it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Organ agreed that a segment of his students are enrolled because
they are interested in the class, but a majority "in all honesty ...
come in because their career counselors need to place them in a
class."</TE>
<TE>   While he tries to make the course worthwhile for all students, it
"is really designed for students who are not going to college," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon in Fremont's cosmetology class, nearly 20
students grabbed peach or sea green-colored plastic finger bowls for
a lesson in manicures. Meanwhile, 20 students in an adjoining room
sat in front of triangular mirrors and took a vocabulary quiz on the
study of hair.</TE>
<TE>   Mariela Alferez, 18, took cosmetology for two semesters in a row
because "it's like a free period class," she said. "It's fun."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to attend Cal State Los Angeles and become a teacher,
while also working in cosmetology on weekends to pay for school.</TE>
<TE>   But Leticia is not as optimistic. She said she feels as if she has
been neglected and shuffled around by counselors. "They don't take
the time for those who do want to learn," she said. "They think kids
from South-Central are not going to go to USC, we're not going to go
to college. They want us to do the manicures for the kids who are
going to USC."</TE>

<LD>The Avengers opened their third training camp Tuesday at West Los
Angeles College with a new coach, more new faces and renewed hopes
for a winning Arena Football League season.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Ed Hodgkiss greeted 15 players who played at least one game
for last year's 5-9 team, as well as 15 new players.</LD>
<LD>   Hodgkiss, who was hired in October, said the competition for the
24 roster spots was "wide open," but he didn't think it would take
long to mold the team.</LD>
<TE>   "Because of the nature of the Arena game, there's not a ton of
[different] things you can do," he said. "What I'm gonna focus on is
us playing hard and playing smart. Those are two things that we can
control."</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers will scrimmage Saturday at West Los Angeles College
against the Georgia Force (formerly the Nashville Kats). They will
play an exhibition game in Bakersfield against Georgia on April 4,
and another at Chicago against the Rush on April 12 before opening
the regular season April 19 at home against the New York Dragons.</TE>

<LD>Sunday Break, the Japanese-bred son of Forty Niner who was a 90-1
shot on a Kentucky Derby future book, is going for his third win in a
row today at Aqueduct in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The colt, owned by Koji Maeda and trained by Neil Drysdale,
probably will be in the 2-5 range when he starts against five others
in the sixth race, a $50,000 allowance at 11/8 miles.</LD>
<LD>   Should Sunday Break lose this afternoon without a major excuse in
a race that is being used as a prep for the Wood Memorial on April
13, his ultra-conservative trainer probably will bypass the Wood and,
almost certainly, the Kentucky Derby too.</LD>
<TE>   Gary Stevens, who had a successful week in Dubai, winning major
races with Grey Memo and Caller One on Saturday, will stop in New
York on his way back to California to take his regular place atop
Sunday Break.</TE>
<TE>   In his four-race career, Sunday Break has won his last two at
Santa Anita, beating allowance rivals by two lengths in his first
route after breaking his maiden by 41/2 lengths on Jan. 21. In his
debut at Hollywood Park on Nov. 25, he finished second, beaten by a
head, then was third, as the 7-5 favorite, on Dec. 26, the opening
day of the Santa Anita meet.</TE>
<TE>   His rivals include the Todd Pletcher-trained duo of Tomahawk Lake
and Smoked Em, recent maiden winner Peruvian Summer, Iwin--who won an
allowance at Suffolk Downs on March 9--and Dr. Rockett.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: A full field of 2-year-olds will get together in
the first at Santa Anita. Interesting commodities include Maruka,
Feed For Speed, The Andes Storm and Sweet Jessa.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Christophe Clement. After a slow start at Gulfstream
Park, the trainer has warmed up and is batting .230 for the meet. He
won the $200,000 Orchid Handicap for a fourth consecutive year Sunday
with 5-1 shot Julie Jalouse.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Ed Moger Jr. The trainer has won with six of 142
starters at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Fantasy Spin in the
fifth, using Desert Ballet and Accell in the sixth, Autumn Rhythm and
Honestly Darling in the seventh and He's A Natural, Roy Boy and Gamer
in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/184. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $18.20/$1,086.20. Total money bet: $1,116.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He has exceeded everybody's expectations. Apparently, that's not
enough.</LD>
<LD>   Andre Miller led his college team to the Final Four, got his
degree at Utah, was a lottery pick and now he's the top assist man in
the NBA. There was a time when you would have bet against any or all
of those things. And maybe you can get still get good odds on the
next challenge.</LD>
<LD>   "Andre has the chance to be one of the top 15 players in the
league," Cleveland Cavalier Coach John Lucas said. "I'm trying to
wake that elephant up every night.</LD>
<TE>   "In saying that, we obviously don't have the best personnel in the
league. So for us to be competitive, he's got to have big numbers
every night until I can get us help. He has done that. I'm very hard
on Andre. But look what's happened. This is his best year ever."</TE>
<TE>   He's averaging a double-double, with 16.7 points and 10.7 assists
per game. That includes five 30-point games, 22 assists against the
Philadelphia 76ers on Dec. 15 and an off-the-backboard pass to Ricky
Davis for a fastbreak dunk Tuesday night at Staples Center. He
finished with 21 points and nine assists in the Lakers' 121-116
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's a modest guy when he talks about his accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys around us are having pretty good years shooting the ball
well," Miller said. "It makes it a lot easier to pass the ball in a
good situation. They'll be able to knock down the shot."</TE>
<TE>   Let's get real. The guys around him are the Cleveland Cavaliers.
More often than not in this injury-plagued season, they're the
substitute Cleveland Cavaliers. The list of out-of-action players
Tuesday included Lamond Murray, Tyrone Hill, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Jeff
Trepagnier and first-round pick DeSagana Diop.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's big number on Tuesday was 50. That's the number of family
and friends the L.A. native (and Verbum Dei graduate) had at Staples
Center. That's about $4,000 worth of tickets. At least his people got
in legally.</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, he wasn't so legit when he went to Laker games at
the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to sneak up in there when I was younger," Miller said.
"Where I went to junior high school [Inglewood Christian] was right
around the corner. I played at the YMCA right around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   "We would just run [down the tunnel], break down there while they
weren't looking. We got caught one time, though. They called the
police."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for him, his mother never found out. Andrea Robinson
always tried to keep as close an eye on him as possible. That meant
taking buses all the way to Texas to watch him play in NCAA
tournament games, and calling in to voice her displeasure when she
saw him on TV wearing his hair in braids in a game earlier this
season.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't have to go very far to see Miller's best college game.
It was at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, for the 1998 NCAA West
Regional final. It was one of the most thorough college performances
I've ever seen, Miller single-handedly beating Arizona with 18
points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists, two steals and a blocked shot. He
ran the offense and was everywhere on defense and he clearly
outplayed Arizona point guard Mike Bibby, whom some people were
touting as the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby wound up going to Vancouver with the No. 2 pick that year,
after the Clippers selected Michael Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   Miller went back to school. After entering school as a
non-qualifier under Proposition 48 regulations, Miller had earned
another year of eligibility by getting his degree in four years. He
went to Cleveland with the No. 8 pick in the 1999 draft, and quickly
made incumbent point guard Brevin Knight expendable.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the day of that 1998 regional final performance, Utah
Coach Rick Majerus said that he thought Bibby would be a better pro
than Miller. We all thought he would. But is he?</TE>
<TE>   Miller averages more points and twice as many assists, despite
playing for a much worse team than Bibby's Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Miller would be perfect for the Clippers if they can't work things
out with Jeff McInnis, who will be a free agent this summer. The
Cavaliers have an option for Miller's contract next year, then it's
up to them if they want to extend his contract. They'd be foolish not
to. But they might also be willing to think of a trade if the
Clippers were offering Lamar Odom or Corey Maggette and Keyon
Dooling.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, Olowokandi, Quentin Richardson, Elton Brand, Darius Miles.
Nothing wrong with that five.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, Miller wears a Cleveland uniform. He just became the
franchise's all-time assists leader. And he's just about all Lucas
has to enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   "He's getting so much better," Lucas said. "But I see continued
growth in him.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk about him, let's establish one thing: I love him. I
think he's great. But I think there's so much more that I've got to
get from my team to be good. We don't have a Shaq and a Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   "For him, he's got to make the best of what he has. He's got the
ball 80% of the time, so he's going to have big numbers."</TE>
<TE>   By now, we should have learned not to underestimate Miller. Top 15
in the league? He's already one of only 15 players to rank among the
league's top 40 in scoring and assists. He averages more points and
more assists than Jason Kidd, whom some consider this season's most
valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   You might have slept on Miller before. Don't do it again.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Vaughn Blasts Percival, Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The long-simmering feud between Mo Vaughn and Troy Percival flared
anew Tuesday, when the oft-injured slugger lashed out at Percival for
repeatedly saying that the Angels would miss Vaughn's bat but not his
leadership.</LD>
<LD>   "To continue to come up with what came out of his mouth is
unacceptable," Vaughn said.</LD>
<LD>   In a story in Tuesday's New York Post, Vaughn ripped Percival and
the Angels during a tirade that the newspaper said included 35
expletives. The Angels traded Vaughn to the Mets in December, after
three injury-plagued seasons in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Vaughn on Percival: "Who the ... is Troy Percival? ... He hasn't
done ... to lead them anywhere. I got hardware. I got playoff
appearances. I got an MVP. I've been to the playoffs twice. What the
hell has he done?"</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn on the Angels: "Ain't none of them done a damn thing in
this game, bottom line. They ain't got no flags hanging at ... Edison
Field, so the hell with them."</TE>
<TE>   The outburst was touched off by an article in The Times on Sunday,
in which Percival said, "We may miss Mo's bat, but we won't miss his
leadership. Darin Erstad is our leader."</TE>
<TE>   Percival noted that several teammates had made similar comments
about Vaughn this spring, "But I'm the one that gets stirred into it,
probably, because there's a history there."</TE>
<TE>   Hostility between Vaughn and Percival dates to 1999, when Vaughn
failed to join teammates to defend Percival in a bench-clearing brawl
in Cleveland. The two nearly came to blows afterward. The next day,
teammates told then-manager Terry Collins they would refuse to play
in the same lineup with Vaughn. Two days later, Collins quit.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn said he responded in anger after repeatedly reading similar
comments from Percival--"Three, four, five times? That's ridiculous,"
Vaughn said.</TE>
<TE>   Percival has consistently provided the same expletive-free answer
to questions about Vaughn this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, a four-time All-Star, said he could not dispute the
comments about the Angels' failings. Vaughn is a three-time All-Star.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what? You take out all the expletives, and how many
times have I been to the playoffs? How many times have I won? It's
not an individual game. I don't play it that way," Percival said.
"That's fine.... I'm not going to sit and get into a war of words
with somebody who's not on my team. The guys in my locker room know
how I play the game and how I respect it."</TE>
<TE>   Said pitcher Jarrod Washburn of Percival, "He's a great leader of
the pitching staff and of the team as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   In the Post article, Vaughn said the Angels had "destroyed my
arm," an allegation he retracted Tuesday. Vaughn played the final
weeks of the 2000 season with an undetected torn biceps tendon, an
injury that required surgery and was responsible for his missing the
2001 season. Vaughn acknowledged last year that he'd felt pain in the
elbow but had not complained about it until after the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, the Disney executive who oversees the Angels and
Mighty Ducks, said that the company is not keeping the presidency of
its sports division vacant because one or both teams might soon be
sold. Pressler has yet to embark on a search for a president to
replace Tony Tavares, who resigned as president of Anaheim Sports on
Jan. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very sincere when I say that we're operating these teams as
if we were going to operate them forever," Pressler said. "I'm not
making any decisions based on what might happen with a sale."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama businessman Donald Watkins met with Disney executives
Friday to discuss his interest in buying the Angels. A group led by
former Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts is believed to
be interested in buying both teams. No talks are believed to have
advanced beyond preliminary stages.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler appointed Kevin Uhlich the Angels' senior vice president
of business operations and plans to hire someone to fill the same
position with the Ducks. Pressler, chairman of Disney's parks and
resorts division, said last month he would fill Tavares' position but
now is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I can do the job from where I sit, with two business
heads in place," Pressler said. "Once I get them in place, I'll
determine whether that's a good decision or not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels put left-handed reliever Dennis Cook on the disabled
list. Cook, who suffered bruised ribs in the bench-clearing brawls
with the San Diego Padres on March 9, will be eligible for activation
April 5, when the Angels play their fourth game of the season....
Reliever Lou Pote, counted on as a bridge from the starters to
Percival, gave up three home runs in 12/3 innings in the Angels' 10-6
exhibition loss to the Seattle Mariners. Pote has a 13.09 earned-run
average this spring.</TE>

<HD>Selig: No Lockout This Season</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Union leaders, wary of commissioner's pledge, are
wondering what will happen after the World Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, trying to reassure fans that major
league owners won't initiate a work stoppage this season, vowed
Tuesday not to lock out players through the World Series. His
prepared statement made no mention of what might happen after that,
however, which the head of the players' union saw as a threat.</LD>
<LD>   "Our fans deserve to know that the 2002 season will be played to
completion without interruption, and they deserve to know that now,
before we begin the new season," Selig said in his statement.
"Therefore, on behalf of the clubs, I pledge that we will not take
any economic action, either in the form of a lockout or unilateral
implementation against the players' association, throughout the
course of the season and postseason.</LD>
<LD>   "The sanctity of the season, however, is only partially within my
control. Since we do not have a new collective bargaining agreement,
the players have the right to strike at any time. I sincerely hope
that they share my strong feeling about the importance of playing the
entire season."</LD>
<TE>   Selig said that with opening day Sunday, he moved to allay fans'
concerns because he thought "the timing was good."</TE>
<TE>   Owners and the Major League Baseball Players Assn., the union,
remain far apart on key issues for a new labor agreement to replace
the one that expired Nov. 7, and the specter of new work rules being
unilaterally implemented after the season could at any time trigger
baseball's ninth strike since 1972. Owners also could adopt a
strategy the NBA used after the 1998 finals, locking out players
after the Series.</TE>
<TE>   "[Selig] specifically limited the pledge to the season and
postseason, reserving for himself the right to kick off the same
strategy the NBA did," said union head Donald Fehr, calling Selig's
statement "a tacit acknowledgment of the clubs' continuing intention"
to make changes after the Series.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr was noncommittal on whether players would respond with a
no-strike gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "The players setting a strike date is always a last resort," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many in baseball believe a work stoppage is inevitable because
neither side appears ready to capitulate on differences regarding
luxury taxes and revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Players are typically distrustful of management, which has claimed
hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses, and are not in
agreement about baseball's supposed competitive-balance problem.
Players to this point have rejected the owners' proposals for a major
increase in revenue sharing and a 50% luxury tax on the portions of
payrolls exceeding $98 million.</TE>
<TE>   The union is against siphoning resources from high-revenue teams
that they might otherwise invest in player salaries, and is
vehemently opposed to a luxury tax that would slow the increase in
salaries and player movement. Negotiations, suspended March 13, are
expected to resume next week, but progress is doubtful.</TE>

<HD>Burkett's Injury Opens Spot for Ecstatic Banks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one corner of the Boston Red Sox clubhouse at Fort Myers, Fla.,
pitcher John Burkett was talking about disappointment over an injury
than will sideline him for the start of the season.</LD>
<LD>   A few lockers down, pitcher Willie Banks was thankful to be
getting a second chance because of that injury.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Grady Little told Banks on Tuesday he had made the team.
Banks probably would have been the last pitcher released if Burkett
hadn't gotten hurt.</LD>
<TE>   "My hands are shaking right now," Banks said with a smile after
meeting with Little.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been sent down [to the minor leagues] the last day a couple
times," he said. "For him to tell me I made the team, I don't know
what's better, graduation day, winning the championship or making
this club right now. I worked hard and it all paid off."</TE>
<TE>   Banks, a first-round draft pick in 1987, sat out the 1996 season
because of nerve damage in his right shoulder that caused the muscle
to deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   He had brief stops with the New York Yankees in 1997 and 1998
before going to the minor leagues and Japan. He caught on with Boston
at the end of last season.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, 33, has a 4.20 earned-run average in 15 innings this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I woke up this morning and I was just praying to God, man," Banks
said. "My knees are all bent down and dirty right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger Scott Radinsky, hoping to make Cleveland's opening
day roster as its second left-handed reliever, was waived by the
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Radinsky, 34, had a 14.29 ERA in eight appearances this spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An exam showed no ligament damage to Texas pitcher Ismael Valdes'
right elbow, but the Rangers put closer Jeff Zimmerman on the 15-day
disabled list because of tendinitis in his right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets traded infielder Lou Collier to Montreal for
minor leaguers Jimmy Serrano, a pitcher, and Jason Bay, an
outfielder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mace Brown, who pitched for three major league teams in the 1930s
and 1940s, died Sunday in his home at Greensboro, N.C. He was 92.</TE>
<TE>   As a rookie with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Brown saw Babe Ruth, then
with the Boston Braves, hit his last three homers on May 25, 1935.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of heading to the Braves' dugout after his third homer,
Ruth headed for the showers. He had to pass through the Pirates'
dugout to reach the clubhouse and, spotting an open seat, sat next to
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget it," Brown recalled in a 1998 interview with
The News and Record of Greensboro. "He sat down on our bench right
beside me. 'Boys,' he says, 'that last one felt good.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ruth played his final game May 30, 1935.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had a career record of 76-57 and a 3.46 ERA. He pitched the
final three innings of the 1938 All-Star game.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marcus Taylor plans to forgo his final two seasons at Michigan State
to make himself available for the NBA draft.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor, who emerged this season as the Spartans' go-to player,
doesn't plan to hire an agent and still could return to Michigan
State.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not that I'm in a big hurry to leave MSU, because I have
great respect for the coaches, players and university," Taylor said
in a statement released Tuesday by the school. "I've enjoyed my
collegiate experience, especially the great support from the student
body.... Becoming an NBA player has been one of my goals for a long
time."</LD>
<TE>   Taylor led the Spartans this season, averaging 16.8 points and 5.3
assists. He was an All-Big Ten first-team selection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frank Broyles, athletic director at Arkansas, received permission
to talk with Kent State basketball Coach Stan Heath about replacing
Nolan Richardson as the Razorbacks' coach.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Moon, Broyles' counterpart at Wyoming, confirmed that Cowboy
Coach Steve McClain is in the running for the Arkansas job.</TE>
<TE>   Heath, 36, just finished his first season at Kent State, guiding
the 10th-seeded Golden Flashes to the NCAA tournament's South
Regional final, where they lost to Indiana, 81-69.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas bought out Richardson's contract this month.</TE>

<LD>Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "Nothing important ever
happens in basketball until the end. This is the essence of the game.
Absolutely dependable.</LD>
<LD>   "You can come in late and not miss a thing.</LD>
<LD>   "The tidiness of it is unparalleled in athletics. No one wants to
miss the opening kickoff or the first pitch, but anyone who can
remember the first shot of a basketball game has a garage full of
string and will wash his laundry one sock at a time."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which two Pacific 10 women's teams have won the NCAA
basketball championship?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catching up: Arnold Palmer, 72, has vowed never to play another
PGA event because he's been shooting in the 80s. Jim Armstrong of the
Denver Post recalls what Jack Nicklaus said as he struggled after
hip-replacement surgery: "For years, everyone told me, 'I wish I
could play like you.' Well, now you can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Armstrong: "That $39.95 to watch Larry Holmes go at it with
Butterbean Esch? Do we pay that or get paid that for watching it?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clever: And this from Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times on the
Holmes-Esch bout: "Lard of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wise retreat: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News:
"Correcting History: Popular notion is that Paul Bryant got his Bear
nickname by out-rassling a bear when a circus visited Fordyce, Ark.</TE>
<TE>   "Not so.</TE>
<TE>   "A 14-year-old Bryant was egged on by schoolyard pals to accept
the circus challenge to rassle the animal for $1 a minute. The bear's
muzzle came loose, young Bryant fled from the theater and never
collected the money."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His challenge: Steve Spurrier, the new Washington Redskin coach,
in an interview with Ira Miller of the San Francisco Chronicle: "It's
always of interest to me that people would say [my] receivers in
college were mostly wide open, but in pro ball, they won't be.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I guess we're gonna find out if we can get 'em open or not.
So that's the intrigue, I think, in me and a lot of people to see if
we can do that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Spurrier: Adam Schefter in the Denver Post: "He has a
beautiful mind, a guaranteed $25-million contract and new Redskin
visors on order that some other NFL coaches will want to bash as much
as Spurrier himself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A comma got him: From comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "Former San
Diego Padre star Tony Gwynn was hired by ESPN. As he was reviewing
the contract, Gwynn pulled a hamstring hustling from the first
paragraph into the second."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1939, Oregon defeated Ohio State,
46-33, winning the first men's NCAA basketball championship in
Evanston, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC in 1983 and 1984; Stanford in 1990 and 1992.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: "During the press conference introducing the Raiders'
new head coach," says MSNBC.com's Michael Ventre, "Al Davis sat in a
fancy silver-and-black armchair resembling a throne while the
designee, Bill Callahan, sat in a folding chair.</TE>
<TE>   "To mark the occasion, Davis instituted a temporary ban on
beheadings and then summoned a jester to play the lute."</TE>

<HD>Frustrated Clippers Beginning to Lose It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>These are desperate times for the Clippers, which is probably a
victory in itself this late in the season. They need victories on the
court rather than consolation prizes. The feel-good moments passed
quite some time ago.</LD>
<LD>   You could see it in their faces Tuesday as they played the
Sacramento Kings. Smiles were fewer than in past days. Jaws were set
a little firmer. They were quicker to anger. More easily frustrated.</LD>
<LD>   Raw emotion got the Clippers only so far against a superior
opponent, however, and they fell with a thud to the Kings, 107-90,
before a sellout crowd of 17,317 at Arco Arena and a national cable
television audience.</LD>
<TE>   The loss was the Clippers' third consecutive and left them 31/2
games out of a playoff position in the Western Conference standings
with 10 games to play. Their streak of holding the opposition under
100 points ended at 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, the eighth-place Utah Jazz rallied
in the fourth quarter to earn a 109-105 victory over the Houston
Rockets. It's to the point now where the ninth-place Clippers are
going to need help if they hope to overtake the Jazz and qualify for
the playoffs for the first time since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers play the Jazz twice, including Saturday at Staples
Center. But it's probably going to take more than sweeping both games
from Utah in order to vault over the Jazz and move among the top
eight in the West by season's end.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want it so bad," point guard Jeff McInnis said after the
Clippers returned to the .500 mark at 36-36. "We're just playing so
hard. I don't think we're putting too much pressure on ourselves.
We're just playing hard."</TE>
<TE>   After a poor start that left them trailing, 28-21, the Clippers
played the Kings to a standstill over the next two quarters. A 79-72
deficit entering the fourth certainly wasn't insurmountable, but the
Kings were too powerful down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber led Sacramento (50-19) with 35 points on 15-of-21
shooting and Doug Christie added 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Webber proved that if he's not the best power forward in
the league, then he's in the top two or three," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "He played great. They're a great basketball team."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi countered with 23 points for the Clippers, but
got into foul trouble in the third quarter and drew a technical foul
after kicking the ball the length of the court in frustration after
picking up his fourth personal.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand was held to three points and four rebounds and didn't
play in the fourth quarter because of flu-like symptoms. "Who told
you?" he asked reporters. "Coach wasn't supposed to tell anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said nothing about Brand's condition or his status for
Friday's game against the Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Olowokandi's technical foul and other instances when
the Clippers could be seen bickering among themselves and at the
referees, he said, "The only thing that disappointed me was the way
we conducted ourselves. Being young is not an excuse for being
stupid. We've tried to establish something here and we're not going
to let it slip away in the last 10 games of the season."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings seemed vulnerable at the start, with Peja Stojakovic
sidelined by a strained right hamstring and Hedo Turkoglu falling ill
during the pregame warmup because of food poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the Kings were still smarting from Sunday's one-point loss
to the Lakers and perhaps looking ahead to a six-game trip that
starts Thursday. They held a team meeting before practice Monday to
discuss the game against the Lakers, hoping to put it behind them
before facing the Clippers and departing on their last lengthy trip
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody named Gerald Wallace smashed any notions of a possible
Sacramento letdown by torching the Clippers for 14 points in the
first half--only six points off his career best. Wallace drove to the
basket for layups and dunks. He followed up missed shots. He launched
jump shots from the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in a Clipper uniform seemed interested in checking Wallace,
so he kept going and going. Gentry seethed on the sideline, furious
at his team's lack of concern as the deficit climbed to as many as 13
points in the first half.</TE>

<HD>Richardson Makes Bid for Sixth-Man Award</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Clipper guard Quentin Richardson was averaging 13.8 points and 4.2
rebounds in 26.8 minutes going into Tuesday's game against the
Sacramento Kings. Bobby Jackson, a Sacramento guard, was averaging
11.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 22.1 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Tuesday featured the Clippers versus the Kings, two of the
NBA's better and more exciting teams. But it also showcased two of
the league's best reserves, its leading candidates for sixth man of
the year honors.</LD>
<LD>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry dismissed any notions that there are
others deserving of the award. He also suggested that Richardson had
better win this season because he'll probably be a starter in
2002-03.</LD>
<TE>   "I like him coming off the bench now," Gentry said. "He knows he's
going to play significant minutes. He likes the role. But that's not
to say that next year he won't be a starter. This season, he and
Darius [Miles, a reserve forward] are more comfortable coming off the
bench."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also likes the spark Richardson gives the Clippers when he
enters, usually with Miles near the end of the first quarter or at
the beginning of the second.</TE>
<TE>   "He creates mismatches right off on post-ups," Gentry said of
Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Small forward Corey Maggette warmed up with his teammates before
the game, but did not play because of two dislocated bones in his
right hand. Maggette, on the injured list since Feb. 22, is expected
to play Friday against the Suns at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping I could start back against San Antonio and [against
Sacramento]," said Maggette, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on
his left knee while he was on the injured list. "I gotta crawl before
I can start to walk again."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry spoke in a whisper again Tuesday because of the cold he
caught from his young sons. But he confessed to earning his technical
foul in Monday's loss to the Spurs. His voice did not fail him when
he bellowed at the referees midway through the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't D.J.," he said, referring to assistant Dennis Johnson.
"I deserved it."</TE>
<TE>   The final 10 games for the Clippers: Friday, at Phoenix; Saturday,
Utah; April 3, at Utah; April 4, at Dallas; April 7, Denver; April 8,
at Seattle; April 12, Sacramento; April 13, Minnesota; April 16,
Memphis; and April 17, at Golden State.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Glory in Black and White: the Story of the 1966 NCAA
Basketball Championship"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Ch. 2, Sunday, 1:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   In 1966 Texas Western, featuring an all-black lineup, upset an
all-white Kentucky team in the NCAA title game. The game changed
college basketball forever.</TE>
<TE>   This excellent 11/2-hour documentary was produced by Black Canyon
Productions, which has produced such award-winning shows as HBO's
"Fists of Freedom" and the "When It Was a Game" series.</TE>
<TE>   This show takes a look at the two teams, at Texas Western Coach
Don Haskins and Kentucky's Adolph Rupp, and at everything that led up
to the game played at College Park, Md. The show also examines a time
when racial integration was just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Western guards Willie Worsley and Bobby Joe Hill, looking
back, sum up the attitude of many at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Blacks couldn't think under pressure," says Worsley
sarcastically.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's words about racist attitudes of that era are even harsher:
"You'd never start five blacks. It's a joke. It's like putting five
animals out there. Who's going to run that show? You've got to put
someone out there with brains."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Riley, a star for the Kentucky team, says, "Years later you
look back. Maybe they were playing for something a hell of a lot more
significant. And if they were, then the right team won."</TE>

<KH>DAVIS CUP</KH>
<HD>U.S. to Face Hampered Spaniards</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spain's top player, Juan Carlos Ferrero, has an injured foot and will
not play in next week's Davis Cup quarterfinal against the United
States in Houston. Alberto Martin replaces Ferrero, who suffered a
stress fracture in his right foot playing against Todd Martin in the
second round at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of Ferrero, who reached the third round at Wimbledon last
year, is a big blow for Spain, which already faced a tough assignment
on grass against the likes of Pete Sampras and Martin. U.S. Davis Cup
captain Patrick McEnroe selected the rest of his squad Tuesday,
choosing Andy Roddick and James Blake to join Sampras and Martin.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt that if we played on a hardcourt, a fast hardcourt, we
could still win and probably would win," McEnroe said. "But we wanted
to give ourselves the best possible opportunity to win. So, I feel
that grass gives us that option.</LD>
<TE>   "But at the same time, [the Spaniards] are young guys, especially
have a lot of firepower. [Tommy] Robredo's played well on grass.
They're feisty, they're competitive. [Alex] Corretja and [Juan]
Balcells are going to be a tough doubles team no matter what surface
we're on."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Daal Wants Out; Roberts Will Start in Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Omar Daal wanted to make himself perfectly clear. The Dodger
left-hander did not merely ask for a trade before throwing six
shutout innings in a 7-1 exhibition victory over the New York Mets on
Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I demanded a trade," Daal said.</LD>
<LD>   Daal, guaranteed $5 million this season, has no contractual right
to demand a trade, but after being informed Tuesday afternoon he
would open the season in the bullpen and not the rotation, he told
Manager Jim Tracy he wanted out.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be best for me and best for the team to go somewhere
else and be a starter," Daal, 30, said. "I won't be happy in the
bullpen .... I'm upset about this. I'm mad."</TE>
<TE>   Daal's request puts the Dodgers in a precarious position. They
lost some of their rotation depth when they moved Eric Gagne to the
bullpen and need Daal as insurance should Kevin Brown or Andy Ashby
suffer a setback in their return from elbow surgery or another
starter gets hurt.</TE>
<TE>   But they don't want Daal to be a distraction, and they don't want
him to be so consumed by his frustration that it affects his
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We really like Omar Daal, and before the year is over he's going
to pitch some important innings for us," General Manager Dan Evans
said. "No team goes through an entire season with no changes in their
five-man rotation. We need starting pitching depth, and while Omar
isn't in the opening-day rotation, he will be a contributor."</TE>
<TE>   Daal, acquired in a winter trade from Philadelphia, was the
opening-day starter for the Phillies last season and went 13-7 with a
4.46 earned-run average. He welcomed the trade to Los Angeles because
he thought he was a lock to make the rotation, but after dealing for
Daal, the Dodgers acquired pitchers Hideo Nomo, Odalis Perez and
Kazuhisa Ishii, who will join Brown and Ashby in the opening-day
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "I won 13 games last year," said Daal, a soft-throwing
breaking-ball specialist. "Nobody in this [Dodger] rotation won that
many games.... [Tracy] said they're not sure about the two starters
coming back from surgery, but I think I can still be a starter with
those guys here. I'll do my best, but I would rather be traded."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have no attractive starting pitching options at
triple A, are not expected to honor Daal's request unless they
receive an outstanding offer. There was little trade interest in Daal
this spring, but that could change after Tuesday night. Daal was
masterful against a lineup of Met regulars, giving up one hit,
striking out six and walking one.</TE>
<TE>   "He walked out there tonight and showed what kind of professional
he is," Tracy said. " ... He's not completely sold on going to the
bullpen, but if he has to do it, he'll do the best he can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy had numerous closed-door meetings Tuesday, delivering good
news to Dave Roberts, who was named the starting center fielder and
leadoff batter, and Perez, the 23-year-old left-hander who will be in
the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, 29, considered a longshot entering camp, will make his
first big league opening-day start after toiling for eight years in
the Detroit and Cleveland organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "I might relish it on the plane ride [back to Southern
California], but right now I've got to prepare for the season," said
Roberts, who had two hits, two runs batted in and scored a run
Tuesday night. "I'm thrilled, believe me, but I don't want to dwell
on it."</TE>
<TE>   The news was not good for McKay Christensen and Tom Goodwin,
runners-up in the center-field derby, and it was mixed for Marquis
Grissom, who was told he would be a reserve, not sharing center field
in a full-time platoon with Roberts but seeing plenty of action
against left-handed pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to say I'm happy or I'm not happy," Grissom said.
"I didn't come here expecting anything. But I do have total
confidence in my abilities and it will speak when I get on the field.
You can't talk with your mouth. You have to talk with your bat."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers may have no choice but to release Goodwin and eat his
$3.75-million contract because he has drawn virtually no trade
interest. Christensen is out of minor league options and needs to
clear waivers before being sent to the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy and Goodwin were told they're still being considered for the
final bench spot, but it's doubtful either will open the season with
the Dodgers because Tracy prefers another right-handed bat on the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I rather play every day somewhere else? Absolutely,"
Christensen said. "I love California, but I have to go someplace
where I can play every day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, concerned about newspaper
accounts portraying him as being upset about the possibility of being
dropped from the second spot in the lineup, spoke to Tracy and
addressed the team about his comments before Tuesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "No question, I will hit wherever Tracy wants me to hit,"
Grudzielanek said. "I will do anything I can to help the team. I'll
sit on the bench, if that means us winning the World Series. Jim
Tracy is calling the shots."</TE>
<TE>   The seventh and eighth hitters in the Dodger lineup combined to
hit .230 with 25 home runs and 109 RBIs last season. With the speedy
Roberts and Cesar Izturis in the top two spots, Tracy believes
Grudzielanek, who hit .271 with 13 homers and 55 RBIs last season,
could add pop to the bottom of the order and balance to the lineup.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Dry Spell Over, Kariya Is Raining Goals on Opponents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Kariya, the foundation the Mighty Ducks hope to build on at some
point, has regained form.</LD>
<LD>   Early-season struggles are out. Pucks are going in. Kariya has 17
goals in his last 27 games, dating to Jan. 11. He has five multigoal
games in that time, including three hat tricks.</LD>
<LD>   But Kariya expects more.</LD>
<TE>   "I still don't feel I'm as sharp as I should be in terms of
burying my opportunities," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a big improvement from the start of the season, when Kariya
had only six shots in the Ducks' first four games and one goal in the
first 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, it wasn't a case of me getting opportunities to score,
it was a case of me not scoring with the opportunities," Kariya said.
"Sometimes you go through a dry spell where you get a ton of
opportunities and nothing is going in. Then everything starts going
in."</TE>
<TE>   The number of linemates certainly had an effect. But when rookie
Andy McDonald settled in at center, Kariya's production rose. There
has been no drop-off since top line center Steve Rucchin returned
from an injured ankle and replaced McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya is tied for 15th in the league with 30 goals, giving him
six 30-goal seasons in the last seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   His 10 power-play goals, on a power play that lacks production,
also tie for 15th in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "Where early in the year I thought he was trying to shoot bullets
through the goaltender, now he's not overpowering the puck," Coach
Bryan Murray said. "He's just playing now, not pressing. As a result,
the shot is there, and it's going in more often."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Training room update: Oleg Tverdovsky, who suffered a strained
groin injury against St. Louis on Friday, did not practice Tuesday
but is expected to extend his consecutive game streak to 363 tonight
against Phoenix. Tverdovsky played against Dallas on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Chouinard, who has missed 11 games with a strained left
shoulder, will start skating on his own today. Chouinard wasn't sure
when he would return to the lineup but hopes to play before the
season ends.</TE>

who has a broken bone in his left ankle, and Ossi Vaananen, who has a
bruised shoulder.</TE>

<LD>The first meeting of the season between the boys' tennis teams from
Corona del Mar and Irvine University, the top two teams in The Times'
rankings, will take place Thursday in a Pacific Coast League match at
Corona del Mar High.</LD>
<LD>   Had it not been for Atherton Menlo, the meeting would have
occurred Saturday in the finals of the Corona del Mar High/National
High School All-American tournament. The fourth-seeded Bears (11-1),
from Northern California, upset top-seeded University, 5-4, in a
semifinal match.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew Menlo was good, but I didn't know they were that good,"
said Tim Mang, the tournament director and coach of second-seeded
Corona del Mar (12-0), which beat the Bears, 5-4, in the final. Menlo
finished third in the tournament last year and was runner-up in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   University had its full lineup for one of the few times this
season, but in the semifinal, Aaron Yovan and Henry Mak were beaten
in pivotal singles matches and Anson Hsu dropped a hard-fought match
at No. 5 singles. The Trojans (8-2-1) failed to sweep the three
doubles matches necessary to advance.</TE>
<TE>   "It was close all the way," said Hsu. "It was just a few points
here and there."</TE>
<TE>   University, ranked No. 1 last week, rebounded for a third-place
finish, beating Phoenix Brophy, 8-1, which improved on its 13th-place
showing last year.</TE>
<TE>   Match-up problem: If each team has its full lineup, the
round-robin format on Thursday favors University, which has more
depth.</TE>
<TE>   High school play features three rounds of single-set matches
involving different players in singles and doubles. In the Corona del
Mar tournament, a college format was used, which meant top players
could be used in singles and doubles matches.</TE>
<TE>   A college-style set-up might have made for some terrific
competition Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not down to have lost to Menlo, they're a great team,"
University Coach John Kessler said. "But now we won't get to play
Corona del Mar in [the college] format. That's the only
disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   In their absence:  Absent from the Corona del Mar tournament was
two-time defending champion Palos Verdes Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers (5-5) were invited to the event, but Coach Tom Cox
had already made plans for a trip out of town last weekend.
First-year assistant coach Jeremy Schillinger was also unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   "I told [the tournament director] last year I wasn't going to be
available," Cox said. "Besides, at a second thought, I'm not so sure
we belong there this year."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Rylan Rizza, the No. 1 singles player who is headed to
Virginia, returned, but Peninsula lost eight of its top 12 players
from last year's team to graduation or home schooling.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Paul Matysek, the No. 2 singles player, and the top doubles
team of sophomore Geoff Hsu and junior Keigo Fukugaki have helped
Peninsula to victories over University, Irvine Woodbridge, Palos
Verdes Chadwick, Manhattan Beach Mira Costa and Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers' losses are to Corona del Mar, North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake, Beverly Hills, the Division III champion last year,
and Brentwood, the Division V runner-up in 2001, and Dana Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing OK, and we seem to be improving every match," Cox
said. "Some of our guys just need to get some experience."</TE>

<HD>Buchberger Gets to Play in Place of Laperriere</HD>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Kelly Buchberger, sidelined since March 9 because of a sprained right
ankle, returned to the King lineup Tuesday night in place of Ian
Laperriere, who was back home in Manhattan Beach with his wife,
Magali, and their son, Tristan, born Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Laperriere, the only King who had played in all 72 games this
season, is expected to rejoin the team today at Edmonton.</LD>
<LD>   "He talked about flying back today," Coach Andy Murray said before
the Kings' game against the Vancouver Canucks, "but he should be with
his family, so we told him to stay there. There are more important
things than hockey....</LD>
<TE>   "You get more out of your players when you treat them right, I
think. He'll respect that. Look at what he does for us every night
and how hard he plays. He didn't even have to ask. I told him, 'Meet
us in Edmonton.'"</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger, who sat out seven games after playing in 243 in a row,
could have returned earlier, but Murray was reluctant to alter the
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were 6-0 in the veteran winger's absence before losing
Sunday to the Phoenix Coyotes, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to get him in there, but you have to have credibility
with your team," Murray said. "As much as you want a guy like Kelly
Buchberger in there, you have to justify taking somebody else out.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Kelly Buchberger has to earn anything with us. It's
just a situation of, could we give him a few days more to get even
better knowing that the lineup we've got has performed pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With 18 victories on the road, the Kings are three short of the
club record, established in the 1980-81 season, when they were
21-13-6 away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Only two other times in their 35-year history have the Kings won
as many as 20 road games. They play four of their last nine games
away from home: Thursday at Edmonton, Saturday at Calgary, April 11
at Vancouver and April 13 at San Jose.</TE>

<HD>Kings Draw More Blanks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: They lose to Vancouver, 4-0, marking second
straight scoreless effort. Special teams are ineffective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray insisted that Tuesday night's game was equally
important to the Kings as it was to the Vancouver Canucks.</LD>
<LD>   His players, however, apparently didn't get the message.</LD>
<LD>   The determined Canucks, on the verge of elimination from the
playoff race, kept their hopes alive, burying the Kings with three
second-period goals en route to a 4-0 victory in front of a sellout
crowd of 18,422 at General Motors Place.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings, 4-0 losers Sunday at Phoenix, have lost consecutive
games for the first time since mid-November and were shut out in
consecutive games for the first time since February 2000, when they
were blanked at Chicago and Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the wrong time of the year [for this]," King captain
Mattias Norstrom said. "We need that little hunger back that they had
tonight. I think that was the only difference. They were a step ahead
of us, had more jump in their legs."</TE>
<TE>   While the Kings' league-leading penalty-killing unit gave up three
goals for only the second time in 73 games, their league-leading
power play failed to convert in six opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "Special teams is something that has carried us all year," King
defenseman Aaron Miller said, "but they failed us tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Cloutier stopped 18 shots in recording his seventh shutout.</TE>
<TE>   For the Canucks, 10th in the Western Conference and losers of two
consecutive games after winning five in a row on the road to pump new
life into their flickering playoff chances, this was almost a
make-or-break game.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least it was being treated that way in British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, however, was loathe to admit the game was any less crucial
to the Kings, even though their five-point lead over the Dallas Stars
in the race for the final playoff slot in the West remained intact
despite the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We never take things for granted," he said before the game. "I
think my job's on the line every time we take the ice, and I want our
players to feel the same way. We want them recognizing that right now
we've got to play hard every night because somebody's chasing us from
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says, 'You should be looking at the teams in front of
you.' Well, once we get to a secure position and get 93 points, then
we'll take a look at the teams in front of us. Right now, I'm looking
in the rear-view mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're driven by a fear of failure."</TE>
<TE>   His counterpart, meanwhile, said his team was driven by a fear of
the Kings, who have posted the best record in the league over the
last 31/2 months and had not lost in regulation to the Canucks in
nine games under Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it is a very stiff challenge," Canuck Coach Marc Crawford
told Vancouver reporters before the game. "They are, if not the best
team in the league right now, certainly in the top three or four.
They're a great team."</TE>
<TE>   Canuck veteran Trevor Linden, playing in his 1,000th game, asked
that a pregame ceremony marking the occasion be scrapped, lest it
become a distraction. Instead, he was given a video tribute on the
scoreboard about seven minutes into the game, the crowd rising to its
feet to give him a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   The fans weren't nearly as thrilled when Linden drew a double
minor for high-sticking Bryan Smolinski at 18:11 of the first period.
Smolinski needed two stitches to close a cut above his right eye but
returned to the game.</TE>
<TE>   In 3 minutes 33 seconds with the man advantage, however, the Kings
were unable to break a scoreless tie. Their power play ended at 1:44
of the second period when Cliff Ronning was sent to the penalty box
for hooking Brendan Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison scored a power-play goal 76 seconds later, his 20th goal
of the season, taking a pass from Canuck scoring leader Todd Bertuzzi
and flipping a backhanded shot past King goaltender Felix Potvin with
17 minutes to play in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Only 3:09 later, Henrik Sedin gave the Canucks a 2-0 lead,
redirecting a shot from the right faceoff circle by Scott Lachance.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with King rookie Jaroslav Bednar in the penalty box for
hooking Lachance, Bertuzzi scored his 30th goal, taking a pass from
Andrew Cassels and wristing a shot into the net from the bottom of
the right circle with 4:50 to play in the period.</TE>

<LD>The time for learning the offense, finding a shooting stroke, and
developing a feel for teammates appears to be over, and that has
meant more playing time for veterans Brian Shaw and Derek Fisher, and
a lot less for newcomers Lindsey Hunter and Mitch Richmond.</LD>
<LD>   Added for the perimeter threats they'd be when zone defenses were
legalized, Hunter has made 38.6% of his threes and Richmond has made
28.6%.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter played only three minutes Sunday in Sacramento and played
eight minutes off the bench Tuesday night against Cleveland. Fisher
started at point guard, after 22 consecutive starts by Hunter.</LD>
<TE>   "The conversation we had recently was about opportunities and
taking advantage of them," Coach Phil Jackson said of a conversation
with Hunter. "I said, 'As this gets a little closer, things have to
change.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's confidence ... and then making the shots. He's been in a
tailspin for seven or eight games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant's  final shot in warmups was from the three-point
line, toward the other basket, maybe 75 feet away. It banked in, and
he whooped.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't touch me!" he shouted on his way off the floor. "Don't
nobody touch me!"</TE>

<HD>Cavalier Attitude, Laker Win</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: With stars getting a lot of rest, they hold
off Cleveland, 121-116, and keep up with Sacramento.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are the nights the Lakers just grind along, when the challenges
are concentration and motivation and respect, when the Cleveland
Cavaliers stand before them, but what they really want to know is
what the Clippers are doing in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Now they know what it was like to be Billy Crystal all the years
he spent alone in the Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes the Lakers don't have much interest and sometimes they
are attentive enough and game enough, and the Cavaliers were
crestfallen to discover them in the latter condition for much of
Tuesday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal played 25 minutes and Kobe Bryant played 31 as
Phil Jackson forced them to rest for the games that will demand more
of them, and the Lakers were 121-116 winners despite giving up 72
second-half points.</TE>
<TE>   They play tonight at Phoenix, where they have lost consecutive
games. They also are 7-9 in the second of back-to-back games.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 19 points, Bryant scored 17 and Rick Fox, still on
the hairless high that began two weeks ago, scored 18 points,
matching his season high.</TE>
<TE>   It was not always comfortable. Jackson played his bench as the
Cavaliers closed the gap, crossing his legs perhaps when he
considered reinserting one of his stars in the fourth quarter. He
resisted each time, and the Lakers won their 50th game, and their
third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I got accomplished what we wanted to get accomplished in that
game," Jackson said. "We've got a long week."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers lost, 107-90, to the Kings, so the Lakers remained a
half-game behind the Kings in the Pacific Division and Western
Conference. Starting with the one-point victory Sunday in Sacramento,
the Lakers in eight days will have played five games, with Portland
(Friday) and San Antonio (Sunday) coming.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was the only Laker starter to play in the fourth quarter,
and he played only five minutes. O'Neal played eight minutes in the
second half, had only nine field-goal attempts for the second
consecutive game, and again left without addressing the media.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said the time off his feet would serve him well in the
coming days.</TE>
<TE>   "We can get out of here early, get some rest and be ready to
play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Davis scored a career-high 35 points and Andre Miller scored
21, and the Cavaliers came within a three-pointer with 1:11
remaining, which set the departing crowd to grumble over its
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Shaw calmed Jackson's second unit, however. He scored 13
points, made three three-pointers, broke the Cavalier press sometimes
by himself, and took three rebounds. It was enough to guide the
Lakers past the Cavaliers, who might have been inspired by the sight
of O'Neal and Bryant on the bench, leaning near each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just happy to get the opportunity to do something," Shaw
said. "Though it's kind of unfortunate the game came down to what it
did."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jackson: "I figured we had enough moxie in there to figure it
out."</TE>
<TE>   Of some interest, Greg Willard became the first referee--at John
Lucas' urging--to assess O'Neal with a lane violation for stumbling
over the free-throw line while shooting. Many league coaches and
officials have lobbied for the call, most notably former Phoenix
coach Scott Skiles and Dallas owner Mark Cuban. Maverick Coach Don
Nelson pestered referees on the subject a week ago in Dallas, to no
avail.</TE>
<TE>   By rule, the shooter may not advance past the line before the ball
reaches the rim or backboard, by which time O'Neal often has stepped
forward.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has enough trouble at the line without throwing
technicalities at him. Willard made the call early in the third
quarter. Though O'Neal had missed the free throw anyway, he glared at
Willard often in the next few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Already in a fragile state-- having lost six of eight games and
with only eight road victories--the Cavaliers played without Tyrone
Hill, Lamond Murray, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Bimbo Coles and DeSagana
Diop, all injured or ailing to some degree.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shaw made a 38-foot three-point heave as the halftime
buzzer sounded, good for a 55-44 lead, and it felt as though the
Lakers needed it.</TE>

<HD>LPGA Has Its First Big Thing</HD>
<DH>Golf: Sorenstam and Webb can reassert themselves this week
at Mission Hills, with Diaz coming on strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE</DL>
<LD>It has a new name, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, but it's still the
LPGA's first major tournament of the year.</LD>
<LD>   There's nothing like the best female golfers in the world trying
to figure out which way their year is going to go and at the same
time win one of the game's most coveted titles on one of the top
courses they see all year.</LD>
<LD>   Other than that, there's not much at stake in the $1.5-million
event, Thursday through Sunday, at Mission Hills Country Club.</LD>
<TE>   To start with, Annika Sorenstam, the defending champion, should
find the surroundings comforting. That would be good news for her.
When Laura Diaz won last week at Tucson, Sorenstam was five shots
back in a tie for seventh, perhaps feeling the effects of the week
before at Phoenix, when she closed with a 76 and lost to Rachel Teske
in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Karrie Webb, who tied for 42nd at Phoenix and tied
for fifth last week. She did win the Australian Open, which isn't an
LPGA event, so this would be a good time and place for Webb to
reassert herself as she did when she won here in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak, who worked her way into a tight little trio with Webb
and Sorenstam as the Big Three of the LPGA, hasn't been around much
this year. She has played once and tied for 18th at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Davies has won 20 tour events, but this tournament isn't one
of them. She has come close three times--second to Donna Andrews in
1994, and tying for third in 1995 when Nanci Bowen won and in 1998
when Pat Hurst won. Davies turns 39 this year, so her chances might
be running out.</TE>
<TE>   As for Nancy Lopez, her chances are definitely running out,
because that's the way she wants it. Lopez has said she will no
longer play the tour regularly after this year. She missed the cut by
one shot last week at Tucson when she bogeyed three of her last six
holes.</TE>
<TE>   "I never played to make the cut," Lopez said. "I don't think about
it. I am not out there trying to do that, I just want to play my best
golf."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Diaz, who turns 27 next month, is showing signs of
breaking out. The former two-time All-American at Wake Forest is in
her fifth year as a pro, but she didn't make much of an impact until
last year. Diaz tied for ninth in her first appearance at the
Nabisco, was second to Webb in the LPGA Championship and tied for
third at the British Open. It is a record that seems to indicate she
plays well in big events.</TE>
<TE>   What put her over the top at Tucson was her training, Diaz said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the 18th tee, I put my yoga that I had learned during the
off-season into practice, just really trying to control my breathing,
control my nerves, really just thinking about the last hole ... and
not getting distracted."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz is friendly with David Duval, who has given her advice about
a workout routine and about her approach to the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked me, 'Did you earn those seconds last year or did someone
hand them to you?'" Diaz said. "I told them I earned them.</TE>
<TE>   "His advice to me was to just go out and play."</TE>

<HD>Mavericks Storm Past the Bucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The short-handed Milwaukee Bucks were on a roll until Raef LaFrenz
rolled over Michael Redd's left knee.</LD>
<LD>   And that sparked Dallas to a 112-106 overtime victory over the
Bucks on Tuesday night for the Mavericks' first victory at the
14-year-old Bradley Center.</LD>
<LD>   Redd was on his way for a breakaway layup off a steal when LaFrenz
fouled him hard and toppled over him with 11 minutes left in
regulation.</LD>
<TE>   Redd limped to the foul line and sank two shots for an 81-68 lead.
But he couldn't take the pain and left two minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Coach Don Nelson put in a zone defense against the Bucks,
who already were playing without Sam Cassell (toe) and Ray Allen
(knee), and called some plays for Nick Van Exel, who scored 17 points
from that point, including the go-ahead basket in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought if I don't get anything out of Nick, we're not
going to win the game," Nelson said. "So, I called his number and
made him do something and he finally became aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   With their best shooters on the bench and Glenn Robinson shooting
only seven for 22, the Bucks had nothing with which to counter.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 96, Chicago 82--Tracy McGrady had 20 points, 11 rebounds
and seven assists at Orlando, Fla., in his first game back for the
Magic after suffering back spasms last week.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady, who hadn't played since being wheeled off the court on a
stretcher Friday in a loss to Charlotte, admitted he still felt pain
and lacked explosiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "On one play, I tried to dunk the ball with my left hand and I
kind of got pinned on the rim," said McGrady, who made seven of 17
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Jalen Rose scored 20 points, 14 in the third quarter, for the
Bulls, who have lost 13 of 15.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 103, New Jersey 77--Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Jacque Vaughn
each scored 18 points at Atlanta, and the Hawks handed the Nets their
worst loss this season.</TE>
<TE>   Abdur-Rahim averaged 32 points in two previous games against New
Jersey this season. He didn't think the Nets would let that happen
again, so he focused on getting others involved.</TE>
<TE>   "My mind-set was not to score, score, score," Abdur-Rahim said. "I
wanted to make them pay by finding the open guys."</TE>
<TE>   Washington 103, Denver 87--Chris Whitney and Richard Hamilton
scored 22 points apiece for the Wizards, who played their first home
game in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Donnell Harvey had 18 points, and former Wizard forward Juwan
Howard, booed every time he touched the ball, scored 17 to lead the
Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan played 20 minutes and scored nine points.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 115, Minnesota 106--Antawn Jamison scored 25 points
at Minneapolis to help the Warriors end a 10-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors won for only the third time in their last 29 road
games. Even with the victory, Golden State has lost 20 of 23.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 109, Houston 105--John Stockton scored 20 points on his 40th
birthday and the Jazz won its 11th in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Francis led the Rockets with 32 points.</TE>
<TE>   Stockton became the 10th man in league history to play after
turning 40.</TE>

<HD>Spurrier Launches Practice</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier took the field in chilling fog and drizzle Tuesday for
his first practice as an NFL coach. The Fun 'N Gun is definitely not
in Florida anymore.</LD>
<LD>   "Sort of like playing golf in Ireland," said Spurrier, who
exchanged his trademark visor for a black baseball cap because of the
weather at Ashburn, Va.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Redskins' three-day, non-contact mini-camp is a
chance for the new coach to get to know his players and get the feel
of coaching in the big leagues, but the first practices skipped the
preamble and went straight to Chapter One.</LD>
<TE>   "We put in, gosh, more plays in one meeting than I've ever seen in
any offense," quarterback Danny Wuerffel said. "I was thinking, 'How
would these guys adjust to this?' You go to another team and you'll
spend a week on three plays and you'll run them over and over. We've
got just about the entire playbook in one meeting."</TE>
<TE>   At least Wuerffel was familiar with it all, having won the Heisman
Trophy playing for Spurrier at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of stuff," said Spurrier, who left Florida in
January to sign a five-year, $25-million contract with the Redskins.
"Yeah, I sort of believe you give the players a whole bunch of stuff
so they don't get bored."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans completed a deal to send offensive tackle Willie Roaf
to Kansas City. The seven-time Pro Bowl selection was traded for a
conditional fourth-round pick in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The draft choice could escalate to a third-round selection based
on Roaf's playing time this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Lions and often-injured receiver Germane Crowell have
agreed to terms on a three-year contract worth $7.5 million,
according to a team official. Crowell has been slowed by foot and
knee injuries the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh had to use some last-minute negotiations and raise its
offer to free-agent kicker Todd Peterson to keep him from re-signing
with Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson was about to sign a three-year, $2.5-million contract
with the Steelers on Monday when the Chiefs increased their offer to
include a $1-million signing bonus, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reported Tuesday. The Steelers then added a fourth year to the
contract, which totals $3.925 million, and sweetened their bonus from
$450,000 to $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Welcoming the Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson heavyweight title fight to
Memphis, Tenn., on June 8 has nothing to do with morality--it's about
business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not in my job description to regulate the morality of
individuals who participate in sporting events," Mayor Willie
Herenton said. "As mayor of this great city, I made a business
decision. I think the city is going to benefit enormously."</TE>
<TE>   Pro Basketball</TE>
<TE>   Center Oliver Miller, 31, who helped the Phoenix Suns reach the
NBA Finals in 1993, has signed with the Anaheim-based Southern
California Surf of the American Basketball Assn. Miller, 6 feet 10
and 345 pounds, had been playing with the Gary Steelheads of the
Continental Basketball Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara's Donald Mahr qualified for three individual
events in the NCAA men's gymnastics championships April 5-6 at
Oklahoma. Teammates Andre Badilla and Daniel Levine each qualified
for two events, and five other Gaucho gymnasts qualified for one
event.</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League driver Robbie Buhl was released from a hospital
after recovering from a concussion he suffered in qualifying for
Sunday's Yamaha Indy 400 at California Speedway in Fontana. Buhl was
released from Loma Linda University Medical Center on Monday, the IRL
said in a statement released Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Exercise rider Sheri Garcia, 37, died after being thrown from a
horse and hitting her head at Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course.</TE>
<TE>   Hermann Maier's lawyer is seeking more than $4 million in damages
from the driver of the car that collided with the Austrian skier's
motorcycle last summer. Maier did not compete in the Salt Lake City
Olympics after breaking his leg in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Don Sawyer, the public-address announcer at Pauley Pavilion from
1965-92, has died of cancer at 72.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer, a UCLA employee for 36 years, also was a basketball
official from 1960-98 and served as president and instructional
chairman of the Southern California Basketball Officials Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer is survived by his wife of 26 years, Bonnie, who worked in
the UCLA athletic department from 1976-92; four children, Don Sawyer
Jr., Mark Sawyer, Kelly Mayhew and Scott Mayhew; and six
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Sharks Strike Quickly Against Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patrick Marleau's first goal in 16 games came with an assist from the
boards.</LD>
<LD>   Marleau rebounded a shot off the back wall to break up a tie, and
the San Jose Sharks went on to beat the Dallas Stars, 3-2, Tuesday
night at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't get much better than that," Marleau said. "It came
right to me."</LD>
<TE>   With nine games to go, San Jose is trying to fend off the charging
Kings for the Sharks' first-ever division title.</TE>
<TE>   After leading the division for most of the season, the Sharks lost
to the Kings, 3-0, Saturday, putting the teams into a tie for first
place in the Pacific. But San Jose moved back in front by two points
Tuesday after the Kings lost at Vancouver, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton's 3-1 victory over Columbus moved the Oilers ahead of
Dallas for the eighth playoff spot in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Evegni Nabokov stopped 36 shots for the Sharks, giving him 32
victories and tying the franchise mark that he set last season.</TE>
<TE>   Marleau said the close race and the final season stretch gave the
game added intensity.</TE>
<TE>   "It was getting up there, that's for sure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Belfour had 27 saves for the Stars, whose six-game unbeaten
streak on the road ended.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is, at least the playoffs don't start after
tonight," Star defenseman Darryl Sydor said.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a minute into the second period, Adam Graves
picked up Vincent Damphousse's shot in front of the crease and
knocked the puck over Belfour's outstretched glove for a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars tied the score with three minutes left in the period on
Mike Modano's slap shot from the slot against an unscreened Nabokov.
It was Modano's 34th goal. Jason Arnott, playing in his second game
for the Stars since being acquired from New Jersey, earned an assist.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 4, Buffalo 3--Chris Simon scored with 1:58 left to lift
the Capitals at Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Danius Zubrus had a goal and three assists, and Ken Klee and
Brendan Witt also scored for the Capitals, who rallied from a 2-0
deficit in a key game between Eastern Conference teams striving to
stay in playoff contention.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals moved into an eighth-place tie with Montreal, three
points ahead of the Sabres and New York Rangers. It also improved
Washington's record to 4-3 on its eight-game road trip.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 2, Montreal 1--Marcus Nilson scored a power-play goal with
4:19 left in the third period at Montreal, and Wade Flaherty earned
his first NHL victory in 14 months as Florida ended a five-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty, recalled from the AHL on March 20, made 32 saves in his
first start--and appearance--this season for his first victory since
Jan. 26, 2001, when he was with the New York Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Carolina 2--Brian Rolston broke a 27-year-old Boston
record with his eighth short-handed goal and the Bruins won their
season-best sixth in a row, sending the Hurricanes to their first
home defeat since Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, who failed to make the playoffs a season ago, have 94
points--four more than Philadelphia for the top spot in the Eastern
Conference. Boston already clinched a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Boston has won nine of 10 and six in a row on the road, its best
road winning streak since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, Tampa Bay 2--Tie Domi and Alexander Mogilny had two
goals apiece at Toronto, where the Maple Leafs had four goals in a
span of 1:25 in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Reichel's goal at 5:10 gave Toronto a 4-2 lead in the third
period. Dieter Kochan then replaced goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, but it
only got worse.</TE>
<TE>   Kochan gave up three goals on his first four shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt bad for that kid. They put him in there. It was one of his
first games, but that's the price you pay sometimes in the National
Hockey League," Domi said.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Willis and Vaclav Prospal scored for the Lightning, which
has lost two in a row following a seven-game unbeaten streak.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, St. Louis 1--Antti Laaksonen scored on a penalty shot
and Manny Fernandez made 26 saves for Minnesota at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Laaksonen was awarded the penalty shot after he was pulled down by
defenseman Bryce Salvador at 2:33 of the third period.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty-shot goal is the second this season for the Wild. The
Blues have lost three of four, and are 12-16 in one-goal games.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Columbus 1--Anson Carter and Daniel Cleary scored 1:39
apart early in the first period at Edmonton, Canada, and the Oilers
extended their season-high winning streak to six.</TE>
<TE>   Jussi Markkanen, getting a rare start as the backup for Tommy
Salo, made 27 saves and has given up only 22 goals in 13 games (10
starts) this season.</TE>

<LD>With Dajuan Wagner on his team, John Calipari's job is easy.</LD>
<LD>   With less than a minute to play Tuesday night and Memphis facing
its second consecutive NIT semifinal loss, Calipari told Wagner:
"Dajuan, make a play."</LD>
<LD>   Wagner, who finished with 32 points, complied. He drove the lane
and fed Kelly Wise for a dunk with 18.6 seconds to play to lift the
Tigers (26-9) over Temple, 78-77, at New York.</LD>
<TE>   Memphis will play South Carolina for the NIT title Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "That was great coaching strategy," Calipari said of Wagner's
play. "Give him the ball and get out of his way."</TE>
<TE>   Temple (18-15), out of timeouts, took three shots at the end, two
by David Hawkins and one by Kevin Lyde, but couldn't put away a game
in which it erased deficits of 12 and six points.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost the game," said Lyde, who finished with 16 points. "I'm
supposed to make that shot. I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Wesby led the Owls with 25 points, Brian Polk had 15 and
Hawkins 14.</TE>
<TE>   The Owls were without injured top scorer Lynn Greer, who averaged
23.2 points.</TE>
<TE>   Calipari noted Greer's absence.</TE>
<TE>   "When you take away a team's star player, it's like you're playing
a team that's circling the wagons," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina 66, Syracuse 59--Aaron Lucas scored a season-high
20 points to lead the Gamecocks in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   The Gamecocks (22-14) shot 50% from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse's Preston Shumpert scored 28 points.</TE>

<HD>Pistons Beat Pacers to the Punch Line</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Detroit's Corliss Williamson won twice Tuesday night against
Indiana--on the scoreboard and in his skirmish with Jermaine O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   Williamson scored 23 points before he was ejected near the end,
leading the Pistons to a 96-77 victory over the Pacers.</LD>
<LD>   The Pistons were cruising late in the game when Williamson drove
the baseline and was fouled hard by O'Neal. Williamson bounced the
ball off O'Neal's back and the two stood on the baseline jawing
before O'Neal made the first move. He threw an elbow as Williamson
backed away. Several players stepped in to separate them, and O'Neal
threw a punch that didn't land before he was wrapped up by Pacer
assistant Tree Rollins.</LD>
<TE>   Both players were ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know the reason for that kind of foul," Williamson said.
"My reaction was the ball slipped out of my hand. Our team is like a
family. If you pick on one of us, you pick on all of us. We are
always there to pick each other up."</TE>
<TE>   Williamson, who was nine for 13 from the floor and five for six on
free throws, received plenty of support.</TE>
<TE>   Chucky Atkins, who made three consecutive three-point baskets in
the third quarter to spark a 13-0 run that gave the Pistons a
15-point cushion, finished with 18 points. Clifford Robinson scored
13 points and Jerry Stackhouse had 12 for Central Division-leading
Detroit. Ben Wallace had 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Piston Coach Rick Carlisle was angered by O'Neal's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "From my understanding, he [Williamson] will not get suspended,"
Carlisle said. "I can't speak for O'Neal, but that was one of the
worst cheap shots I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Miller, who scored eight points in the first quarter, had 18
points and 15 rebounds for Indiana, which holds the final playoff
spot in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Miller and Ron Mercer each scored 15 points for the Pacers.
O'Neal, who had 11, departed before the locker room was open to
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Pacer Coach Isiah Thomas was surprised by O'Neal's outburst and
disappointed with his team's effort.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something he hasn't shown," Thomas said. "I think it was
frustration. I think the emotions just spilled over."</TE>

<LD>The dispatches have arrived from Vero Beach in fits and starts,
surrounded by static, as if the strange late-night rantings of a
distant radio station.</LD>
<LD>   ZzzzzzzCesar Izturis is starting at shortstop and batting
secondzzzz.</LD>
<LD>   ZzzzzzzEric Gagne is the closerzzzzzz.</LD>
<TE>   ZzzzzzDave, Leon, Bip, Robin, Somebody Roberts is the center
fielderzzzzz.</TE>
<TE>   ZzzzzzMatt Herges is gonezzzzz.</TE>
<TE>   When the Dodgers finished spring landscaping last weekend by
trimming their Herges, the news had become so cryptic, I felt it my
duty to decode it.</TE>
<TE>   After five strenuous seconds, the message became clear.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers don't think they can win this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have started rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   What usually happens only in remote shanties is happening here in
the temple.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are trying to fix past mistakes not with a paint
brush, but with a power scraper.</TE>
<TE>   They are beginning the season with a Kansas City vision, a
Pittsburgh attitude, and a map to third place.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in forever.</TE>
<TE>   They won't say it. Don't be silly. You don't sell widgets by
promising that you will one day sell better widgets. A stadium needs
to be filled, jobs need to be saved, discernment will be practiced.</TE>
<TE>   But they don't have to say it. Everything they have done this
spring is screaming it.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Gagne as the closer? Even though his next save will be his
first? Not of his major league career, but of his professional
career?</TE>
<TE>   Opening day, ninth inning, two out, Dodgers holding a one-run lead
against the San Francisco Giants with Barry Bonds at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   You might pick half a dozen Dodgers to pitch in that situation,
including outfielder Shawn Green, before you would pick Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   But here he is, a former starter with a hockey mentality and a
95-mph fastball the Dodgers hope will overcome his--and our--fears.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue here is, does he have the stuff and the competitive
desire to handle this?" General Manager Dan Evans said. "We think he
does."</TE>
<TE>   Then, Cesar Izturis batting near the top of the order? We can
understand starting the kid at shortstop, but putting him in a
pressure batting position that could include occasionally hitting
leadoff?</TE>
<TE>   The next walk he draws will be the third of his major league
career. Two seasons ago, in his last summer spent in one place, he
batted .218 for triple-A Syracuse.</TE>
<TE>   Batting this 22-year-old kid any higher than seventh or eighth is
asking him to walk a tightrope like, well, like a closer who has
never closed.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll love this kid, he handles the bat well, he can give us
speed at the top," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Then how about a guy named Roberts getting the majority of at-bats
in center field? An exhaustive search has revealed that the guy's
name is Dave Roberts, in town after a career as Kenny Lofton's backup
in Cleveland, only 75 major league games in eight pro seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He is probably only keeping the seat warm for a prospect. We might
have had more fun with Bip.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, amid all these odd additions, what is the Dodgers'
biggest spring subtraction?</TE>
<TE>   Would you believe a clubhouse favorite who went 20-11 for them the
last two years while chewing up 210 innings?</TE>
<TE>   Matt Herges was not sent into baseball exile in Montreal because
he gave up a few bombs in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   He was traded because he is 32, and could make a lot of money next
season as a "middle-aged" setup man, and the Dodgers would rather
have two young Expo farmhands who could help in three years.</TE>
<TE>   He was traded because he is the sort of player who will eventually
fit best on a team on the verge of a championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have just admitted they aren't it.</TE>
<TE>   And these funky steps are only the first ones.</TE>
<TE>   They can't do anything with the contracts of Eric Karros or Mark
Grudzielanek, or they would.</TE>
<TE>   By midseason, however, there could be interest in another veteran
named Kevin Brown. Yes, he has a no-trade clause in his contract.
But, yes, he would probably forfeit that for a chance to return to a
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Something the Dodgers feel isn't happening here.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining his moves, Evans said, "Without risk there is no
reward."</TE>
<TE>   The risk here, though, is larger than that of 162 games.</TE>
<TE>   It is a risk involving 3 million fans, the Dodgers' magic
attendance total that might not be equaled for the first time in a
full season since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   It is a risk involving 44 years of a Los Angeles tradition that
dictates this team would never be known as the Bums.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, maybe we'll buy it.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Gagne, a bespectacled grinder vaguely reminiscent of one of
the Hanson brothers in the movie "Slap Shot," will become a cult
hero.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Izturis is the next Omar Vizquel.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Dave Roberts will work deep counts and catch deep drives and
make us all wonder how we could be so shallow.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they'll all play hard, and keep it close, and make change
fun. Or maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they'll behave like just another lousy, grumbling 80-win
team.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we'll turn our backs on them for it.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they'll have to wait till next year without us. Who knows?</TE>
<TE>   A first for Gagne, Izturis, Roberts, all of us.</TE>

<KH>NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT FINAL FOUR</KH>
<HD>KNOWN BY HEART</HD>
<DH>Shooting Guard Price Might Be Lacking in Size, but Work
Habits Make Him the Pulse of the Sooners</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 6-feet-1, 165 pounds, Hollis Price doesn't look the part of
"tough-guy team leader." Rather, the Oklahoma junior shooting guard
looks as though he should walk around with rocks in his pockets, lest
he be picked up by a sudden gust of wind.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a little guy that weighs about 25 pounds with pointy ears,"
Sooner teammate Ebi Ere said with an admiring smile.</LD>
<LD>   But appearances are deceiving.</LD>
<TE>   Price may look like the tallest kid in middle school, but he is a
baby-faced assassin on the court and has led Oklahoma to its first
Final Four since the Sooners lost the 1988 title game to Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team needs a pulse," Coach Kelvin Sampson said. "Every team
needs a heartbeat. Hollis is our heartbeat. It's a strong heartbeat
because it's a strong team."</TE>
<TE>   And Price, who endured three surgeries in the off-season to repair
a muscle tear in his right arm, his shooting arm, is the one leading
Oklahoma (31-4) on a 12-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   In four NCAA tournament games, Price is averaging 18.3 points,
second on the team, and making 48% (12 of 25) of his three-point
shots.</TE>
<TE>   For the season, he is averaging a team-high 16.8 points with 58
steals.</TE>
<TE>   His statistics may stand out, but his resolve has the Sooners
swooning.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the hardest worker on the floor when he's out there," Ere
said. "He's the hardest worker in practice and he's the hardest
worker in everything we do."</TE>
<TE>   Said senior forward Daryan Selvy, "Without Hollis, we'd be missing
something. He's our leader out there and every good team needs a good
leader. Without Hollis we're incomplete."</TE>
<TE>   Price was reared by his academics-conscious maternal grandparents,
George Carraby and Ann Dennis, and credits their influence for his
strong character and leadership skills.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandparents are stressing the books," Price said. "That was
always the most important thing. They really don't care much about
basketball. I had to finish my homework before I could play."</TE>
<TE>   Price grew up in the Desire housing project in New Orleans, one of
the Big Easy's more depressed neighborhoods, and lived in his
grandparents' small house with his brother, three aunts and their
children. A couch was his bed and when he was 10, he saw an
18-year-old cousin die after a drive-by shooting. He has had little
contact with his father and only recently began sharing holidays with
his mother, Cheryl, who had been in and out of jail the last 20 years
on drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of her," he said. "She has a new job and she's in
treatment every day."</TE>
<TE>   After leading his 17-and-under AAU team to a national championship
and New Orleans St. Augustine High to the Class 5A state title as a
senior, Price had his pick of colleges.</TE>
<TE>   He could have stayed home and gone to Louisiana State. He also had
Oregon, Oklahoma State, Texas and Xavier beating down his
grandparents' door.</TE>
<TE>   But Price chose Oklahoma because he liked Sampson's program.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Price's grandparents liked what Oklahoma had to offer
academically.</TE>
<TE>   "He treats his players like people, not basketball players," Price
said of Sampson. "He told me that Oklahoma was a family and I wanted
to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Price also liked the idea of playing alongside forward Eduardo
Najera, who is now in the NBA but whose pain tolerance is legendary
in Norman.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I learned toughness from," Price said, "from his
ability to deal with and play through injuries."</TE>
<TE>   It was a lesson he has had to apply this year.</TE>
<TE>   Price severed his triceps tendon in a collision with Indiana
State's Kelyn Block late in the Sooners' 70-68 overtime loss in the
first round of the NCAA tournament last year.</TE>
<TE>   After the three surgeries, the first of which was to remove a
portion of one of Block's teeth from his arm, Price was limited to
using his left arm for two months over the summer. He thinks he
became a more complete basketball player because of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I knew the meaning of playing hard," said Price, who
wears a black rubber elbow guard during games and said the arm often
stiffens up at halftime. "You've got your meaning of playing hard and
Coach Sampson's meaning of playing hard. His meaning of playing hard
is 10 times more than yours."</TE>
<TE>   Price, though, measures up.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to expect big things from guys of his caliber," said
Sooner point guard Quannas White, a junior college transfer who
played high school ball with Price and is now his roommate.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tough kid and our coaching staff depends on him to lead
our team."</TE>
<TE>   Last week in San Jose, where the Sooners were wrapping up the West
Regional by beating Arizona, 88-67, and Big 12 Conference rival
Missouri, 81-75, Sampson gushed about what a great person Price is.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson talked about how happy he'd be if his daughter were to
bring home a young man such as Price, how proud he is of him because
he wants to give back to his community.</TE>
<TE>   Price is a sociology major because he wants to work with children.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to help little kids that are going through the same things
I went through growing up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With his hard-knock life as a background, Price will have plenty
of inspirational stories to tell. And he'll never run out of yarns to
spin when it comes to reliving his playing days.</TE>
<TE>   He can tell them about his pregame superstition and ritual of
washing his hands after warmups, but before tipoff, if he doesn't
have a good feel for the ball and is shooting poorly.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed a new set of hands," he'd say.</TE>
<TE>   He can also talk about how Sampson gave him a newspaper article in
which an opposing player downplayed Price's significance and how
Price neatly folded the article and put it in his shoe for the game.</TE>
<TE>   They might not believe, though, that he did both against Arizona
last week before lighting up Wildcat freshman guard Salim Stoudamire,
who'd wondered aloud why Price was being revered, for 22 points and
six three-pointers ... in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams have to honor his quickness," said Sampson, who is going to
his first Final Four in his 19th year of coaching.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of guys who are quick but they can't shoot. Hollis
can take it to the rim on you. But if you step back, he becomes a
cold-blooded killer and he'll shoot the [three-pointer] right in your
face."</TE>

<HD>Dodger Fans Should Be Anxious About Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More on (bleeping) Mo Vaughn in a moment.</LD>
<LD>   But first I bring you these encouraging words from new Dodger
pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii: "If I have anxiety during the season, I won't
be able to win."</LD>
<LD>   My hope is they give the guy a locker right next to a glowering
Kevin Brown, so we can all see what it would be like to have Don
Knotts pitching for the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   Come on, if there's one place in baseball where a starting pitcher
who can't handle anxiety should not be playing, it's in Los Angeles
with the Dodgers. Just wait until Manager Jim Tracy comes to the
mound to take the ball from Mr. Shaky and give it to the Dodgers'
closer-by-committee to try to preserve the win.</TE>
<TE>   There must be some real concern here for the Dodgers, because if
this guy can't handle anxiety, they can't let him sit on the bench
and go through the gut-wrenching experience of watching the team's
leadoff batter try to get on base.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, is there anything more nerve-racking in baseball
than watching Eric Karros try to beat out a ground ball to avoid
hitting into a double play?</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Shaky could talk to his catcher, Paul Lo Duca, and get some
reassurance, but reports from Florida indicate Lo Duca is walking
around in a stupor muttering to himself: "I can't believe Matt Herges
is gone, I can't believe Matt Herges is gone."</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be very difficult for Ishii pitching with someone
holding his hand--although it would explain why Chad Kreuter is still
on the roster.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it, the Dodgers might have a greater need for a shrink
than a closer this season.</TE>
<TE>   According to spring training dispatches, Ishii pitched March 16
against a bunch of guys in New York Yankee uniforms and watched as
Bobby Estalella, Marcus Thames and Scott Seabol went
back-to-back-to-back hitting home runs off him and, while he probably
had no idea who those guys were, neither do I.</TE>
<TE>   This shook him up because he didn't return to the mound again
until Monday against a triple-A team wearing New York Met uniforms.
One of those future Norfolk Tide-bound youngsters hit a homer off
Ishii, which tells me whoever pitches batting practice for the
Dodgers probably will be tougher to hit off than this guy.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder how Tracy is dealing with his anxiety. If you include Mr.
Shaky's work against minor league players, he has a 7.45 earned-run
average this spring; if you consider what he has done against major
leaguers, it's 11.12. He should do really well this September when
everyone calls up their farmhands.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's next appearance will come Sunday in Seattle, and I quote
from the morning newspaper: "Ishii has had trouble controlling his
nerves this spring, and the Dodgers hope an exhibition game in a
major league stadium will help get him acclimated to the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Let me get this straight: This guy was pitching before a few
hundred laid-back fans in Florida, and had trouble controlling his
nerves and getting acclimated to the U.S., but there's a feeling now
he might find himself in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   If he's going to get acclimated to the U.S. in Seattle, he's
probably going to visit Starbucks, and then we're really going to
have a jittery pitcher on our hands.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GOOD news just keeps on coming.... I see where the Dodgers are
now talking about putting shortstop Cesar Izturis in the leadoff
position down the road.</TE>
<TE>   This is super, because he has a .294 on-base percentage in five
minor league seasons, which will continue the Dodger tradition of
starting games with an out.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Goodwin was lousy as a leadoff man, and he has a career
on-base percentage of .335--in the major leagues. Marquis Grissom,
another automatic out, has a career on-base mark of .318. McKay
Christensen stands at .319.</TE>
<TE>   If Izturis doesn't occupy the top spot, there's talk Dave Roberts
will--because he has a lifetime on-base percentage of .292.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK, SO now we know Vaughn reads Ross Newhan like everyone else,
giving the New York Post an obscenity-charged response to Ross'
Sunday story in The Times that quoted Troy Percival: "We may miss
Mo's bat, but we won't miss his leadership. Darin Erstad is our
leader."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't know Erstad was the leader of the team, because he's
always so moody and withdrawn. If he is the leader, though, where was
he when the Angels finished the year losing 19 of 21?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe an occasional cheery, "Let's go get 'em, guys," might have
made a difference.</TE>
<TE>   It's also safe to say Percival's no leader because he let Vaughn
have it after he had left, and after checking to make sure the Angels
won't play the Mets this year.</TE>
<TE>   As for Vaughn, and the 35 expletives he had for his former team
and Percival, he's going to have to do a lot more swearing to catch
up to what Angel fans had to be muttering to themselves while
watching him strike out every 3.7 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   The only way this thing is going to be settled is if the two face
off in the World Series, which means Percival is going to have to be
traded to another American League team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Makaveli:</TE>
<TE>   "I've been greatly influenced by your writing style. I'm 17 years
old and because of your inspiration I wrote an article for my school
newspaper, and the next day was sent to the principal's office. He
told me in his 14 years at the school he had never read anything like
that and he really let me have it. My name was removed from
nomination as writer of the year, and it's all thanks to you."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, kid, you got a sob story to tell, e-mail Plaschke.</TE>

<HD>Win or Lose, U.S. Is in a Tough Spot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It could be a lose-lose situation that faces the U.S. national soccer
team today when it plays three-time world champion Germany in a World
Cup warmup match at Rostock, Germany.</LD>
<LD>   If the United States wins, critics will say it was because
injury-riddled Germany was without virtually its entire starting
lineup, while the Americans were close to full strength.</LD>
<LD>   If the United States loses, critics will question how the team can
possibly expect to do well against Portugal, South Korea and Poland
in the first round of the World Cup if its best players can't even
handle a second-string German team.</LD>
<TE>   What will matter more than the result, however, is individual
player performance. And that goes for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The match at the Ostseestadion (tape-delayed at 7 p.m. Pacific on
ESPN2 and 8:30 p.m. on Telemundo) was a 28,835 sellout within three
days of tickets going on sale.</TE>
<TE>   That was before Germany Coach Rudi Voeller lost such standout
players as goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, defenders Jens Nowotny and
Christian Woerns, midfielder Mehmet Scholl and forward Carsten
Jancker.</TE>
<TE>   In all, a dozen German players opted out of the match, either
because of injury or because they needed to save themselves for
Bundesliga and European Champions League play. Voeller shrugged off
the losses.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you do?" he asked. "You have to work with what you have
and these things happen.... I've got an opportunity to try out a few
things and a few players will get a chance to prove that they deserve
to go to the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Bruce Arena is skeptical of this being an especially
weak German team.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, they're missing people," he said, "but for every good player
they have out, they have another to take his place."</TE>
<TE>   Arena said he expects Germany to be less casual about the game
than Italy was when the Italians edged the Americans, 1-0, at
Catania, Sicily, on Feb. 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the last time in Europe we caught a team that was maybe
not fully prepared," he said. "This time around we will face a German
team that is prepared for the U.S. They also have players that are
fighting for roster spots and have been told plenty of times that
they haven't beaten us the last two times we've played."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. shut out Germany, 3-0, in a friendly at Jacksonville,
Fla., in February 1999, then defeated it again, 2-0, in Guadalajara,
Mexico, during the FIFA Confederations Cup in July 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans, who lost, 2-0, to Germany in the opening round of
the 1998 World Cup, will be without playmaker Claudio Reyna, who has
had a hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   "When we look at the big picture, for a player who has been out a
number of weeks, it's not worth the risk," Arena said. "If he had to,
he probably could have played against Germany, but that's maybe
pushing him too hard, too early."</TE>
<TE>   Injured and questionable to start are striker Brian McBride, who
turned his left ankle in the Columbus Crew's 2-0 loss to the Chicago
Fire at Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday, and midfielder John O'Brien, who
strained a groin muscle during training on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to wait until Wednesday morning to name our roster,"
Arena told Reuters on Tuesday afternoon. "It's too soon right now and
we have to evaluate some guys before we make any decisions."</TE>
<TE>   If McBride is out, Arena's options at forward include Clint
Mathis, Jovan Kirovski, Landon Donovan and Joe-Max Moore. In
midfield, he is likely to select Chris Armas, Earnie Stewart, Eddie
Lewis and the Galaxy's Cobi Jones, assuming O'Brien is unavailable.
Kasey Keller will start in goal.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's players will play in their new 2002 World Cup uniforms,
which feature white shirts with black stripes on the sleeves, black
shorts and white socks--almost the same as they wore in the 1966 and
1970 World Cup tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, four World Cup teams played warmup matches Tuesday,
with 2002 co-host South Korea earning a 0-0 tie against Turkey in
Bochum, Germany, and Nigeria scoring late on a penalty kick to tie
Paraguay, 1-1, in London.</TE>

<HD>Agassi Has His Way Against Johansson</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He looks sharp in 7-5, 6-2 victory over Swede, who
won first Grand Slam partly because of his absence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi's absence from the Australian Open this year helped
Thomas Johansson win his first Grand Slam title. Johansson wasn't so
lucky at the Nasdaq-100 Open.</LD>
<LD>   The ninth-seeded Agassi, seeking his fifth Key Biscayne title and
second in a row, beat the eighth-seeded Johansson, 7-5, 6-2, Tuesday
to reach the quarterfinals.</LD>
<LD>   A wrist injury kept Agassi from bidding for his third consecutive
Australian Open championship in January. He's 12-2 since returning
and looked sharp against Johansson of Sweden.</LD>
<TE>   "It was definitely a letdown not playing Australia this year,"
Agassi said. "It's been a great place for me to get my year started.
But now I've got a lot of energy, and I'm coming out of my shoes
looking for competition."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi's opponent today will be No. 20 Nicolas Lapentti, who beat
Adrian Voinea, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Venus Williams, seeking her fourth title in the event,
became the first semifinalist by rallying past No. 12 Elena
Dementieva, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Williams won despite blowing a 3-0 lead in the first set and
committing 48 unforced errors and 10 double faults.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really felt that I was going to lose," Williams said.
"Theoretically, I should have won the first set."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' next opponent will be the winner of the quarterfinal
today between her sister Serena and two-time champion Martina Hingis.
That match was postponed Tuesday night because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I hope a Williams wins," Venus said. "But win, lose
or draw, I still love her."</TE>
<TE>   A sibling showdown would be the first between the sisters since
Venus beat Serena in the U.S. Open final in September.</TE>
<TE>   By beating Dementieva, Venus extended her winning streak on Key
Biscayne to 22 matches. She missed the 2000 event because of injury
but won titles in 1998, 1999 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I've just picked one tournament that I'm going to win
always," she said with a laugh. "It just happens to be this one."</TE>
<TE>   Two men's fourth-round matches ended with injuries on a sunny,
humid, 85-degree afternoon. No. 5 Tim Henman retired because of a
stiff neck, trailing No. 12 Roger Federer, 6-2. Gaston Gaudio quit
with severe cramping, trailing Juan Ignacio Chela, 6-1, 5-7, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   Henman hurt his neck when he collided with a stranger going
through a doorway Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really look up," Henman said. "So that rules out
serving."</TE>
<TE>   Chela's quarterfinal opponent will be 1998 champion Marcelo Rios,
who beat No. 16 Alex Corretja, 6-2, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt led American James Blake, 6-4, 3-1, when
their match was suspended until today because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   The weather was sweltering when Agassi and Johansson took the
court. Agassi, progressively more confident in his groundstrokes,
broke serve for a 6-5 lead and served out the set.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening game of the second set, Agassi came up with the
shot of the match to break again. He chased down a Johansson volley
to angle a running forehand crosscourt for a winner.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a beauty," Agassi said. "Sometimes those shots happen."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi controlled the baseline rallies by keeping Johansson off
balance and showed unusual snap with his serve, belting eight aces,
including one at 120 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi is playing for the 16th consecutive year at Key Biscayne,
where he won titles in 1990, 1995, 1996 and 2001.</TE>

<HD>Tennessee Streak Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's as close as it comes to a basketball guarantee: Play four
seasons at Tennessee and you'll reach the women's Final Four at least
once.</LD>
<LD>   The eight sophomores and freshmen on this season's team already
are penciled in to join that long list of Lady Vols.</LD>
<LD>   Tennessee's 68-63 victory over Vanderbilt on Monday for the
Midwest Regional title advanced Coach Pat Summitt's squad to San
Antonio for Tennessee's 13th Final Four appearance.</LD>
<TE>   The Lady Vols, who have won six titles, will play top-seeded
Connecticut on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Before this season, Summitt had coached 125 players since 1974,
when women's basketball was still played under the Assn. of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Every player on that list who
completed her eligibility at Tennessee--103 in all--reached the
national semifinals or better, some more than once.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so exciting to come in my first year and make it to the
Final Four," freshman forward Brittany Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Summitt surpassed John Wooden with the most Final Four trips of
any men's or women's college coach. She and the former UCLA coach had
been tied at 12.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dream come true for them. I never once doubted this group

it and never quit believing."</TE>
<TE>   On this season's team, only the seniors and juniors have
experienced a Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Snow was a sophomore, and Kara Lawson, Gwen Jackson and
April McDivitt were freshmen on Tennessee's most recent Final Four
team, which lost to Connecticut, 71-52, in the 2000 championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone looks, I know a lot of fans, too, to culminate the
season with a UConn-Tennessee matchup. It's happening a little bit
earlier this year, but the stakes are just as high," Lawson said.</TE>

<HD>Mediation Ordered in Suit Over Klimt Paintings</HD>
<DH>Court: U.S. appeals panel says Austria, which has six works
seized by the Nazis, must meet with the plaintiff who says they are
hers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Austria and a Cheviot
Hills woman suing for possession of Gustav Klimt paintings seized by
the Nazis to attend court-supervised mediation.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles federal judge ruled last year that Maria Altmann's
lawsuit against Austria could go forward in U.S. courts, but
Austria's lawyers appealed that decision, saying U.S. courts lack
jurisdiction.</LD>
<LD>   At the center of the dispute are six paintings that the lawsuit
values at $150 million.</LD>
<TE>   Among them is one of Klimt's most famous paintings, the "Portrait
of Adele Bloch-Bauer I," a shimmering, gold-encrusted work treasured
as an early landmark of Austrian modernism. A portrait of Altmann's
aunt, it was taken from her uncle's house and delivered to the
Austrian Gallery with a letter reading "Heil Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit order did not address the jurisdiction issue. But
after hearing arguments March 7, the three-judge panel directed both
sides to "explore a possible resolution through mediation" with a
mediator who is to report to the court every 30 days on the talks.</TE>
<TE>   "This panel is of the view that mediation could bring a resolution
that would serve the parties better than results achieved through
litigation," said the court order, dated March 20.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Cooper of Century City's Proskauer Rose, which is
representing Austria, said he did not see the mediation order as a
victory for either side.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to imagine that either side would view this as
anything but a procedural step in the process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether mediation will foster a resolution was not immediately
clear. Both sides have said they were willing to pursue the case to
the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Austrian diplomats have said privately that offering a settlement
might be viewed as tantamount to admitting guilt. It could also
encourage other families to claim other artworks now held in Austrian
museums.</TE>
<TE>   "My position is I've always been in favor of discussing a
resolution," said Randol Schoenberg, the attorney representing
Altmann, and the grandson of the famous Vienna composer who fled Nazi
Germany and settled in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "If this would bring Austria to the table, it's a good thing," he
said, adding: "They should return the paintings."</TE>
<TE>   Austria contends that the paintings were willed to the National
Gallery by Adele Bloch-Bauer, and that U.S. courts have no
jurisdiction over the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The family contends that Bloch-Bauer made a nonbinding request to
her husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, to hand over the paintings after
his death. They say his will--written after the Nazis murdered his
friends and scattered his family--named Altmann and several other
relatives, who have since passed away, as his heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Altmann's lawsuit says that the seizure of the paintings by the
Nazis--along with Bloch-Bauer's house, castle and an enormous art
collection--shows that they did not end up at the Austrian Gallery
through any legal bequeathal.</TE>
<TE>   The jurisdiction issue is a tricky undercurrent in the dispute,
because the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act ordinarily precludes a
country from being sued in U.S. courts. But there are exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The Altmann lawsuit argues that Austria is not entitled to
immunity in this case because the paintings were stolen by the Nazis
in violation of international law, and their images are being
marketed by the Austrian Gallery in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you have some very unusual circumstances," said Arthur
Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School who
is an expert on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a sovereign nation with which the U.S. is on good
terms," he said. "The court may have wanted to avoid a jurisdictional
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I would suggest that mediation is something the federal court
shouldn't do unless it is satisfied it has jurisdiction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hellman said the mediation could be read as a simple procedural
step on the way to a court resolution yet to come. Or "it may be that
the court thinks that one of their mediators could find a way of
enabling Austria to settle without the consequences Austria is afraid
of," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What could Austria offer Altmann to settle the case?</TE>
<TE>   "We're a long way from having concluded what might or might not be
possible," said Austria's attorney Cooper, who learned of the court
order Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Catterson, a spokeswoman of the 9th Circuit, said: "If the
case doesn't settle, presumably the three-judge panel would issue
some sort of decision."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Altmann, 86, said she originally tried to pursue the case in
Austria but could not afford the required court deposits there. She
said she would be "delighted" to sit down and talk about her claim.</TE>
<TE>   "We were always willing to talk to them. They were never willing
to talk to us," said Altmann, who fled to Holland in 1938 after her
husband's release from Dachau.</TE>
<TE>   The couple moved to Los Angeles and her husband took a wartime job
as a Lockheed engineer.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to acknowledge that the paintings belong to us," she
said. "I hope that this is going to bring a solution and this is not
another way for the Austrians to delay, delay, delay until I die. I
want to live to see the paintings."</TE>

<HD>Condors Hang Out With Gliders Over the Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California condor sighting may be rare for those on the ground, but
for the daring few hang gliders who rode a coiling wind a mile above
the San Fernando Valley floor Tuesday, the birds became partners.</LD>
<LD>   One of the condors, which are the biggest birds in North America,
came within 10 feet of a glider. He could read the number placed on
its wing by the conservationists who raised it in captivity.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm here every day, but it seems more special when the condors
fly with us," said "Hungary Joe" Szalai. "Even the crows fly better
than us; we're just imitating them. And the condors still think it
worth coming down to fly with us."</LD>
<TE>   The day before, three condors joined gliders with the Sylmar Hang
Gliding Assn., riding hot air currents, called thermals, high above
the northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The gliders--including a flight instructor, a stunt man and a rock
musician--returned, hoping for another brush with the California
vulture that nearly became extinct 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't have to wait long. As Jim Macklow, a Simi Valley
computer consultant, floated on parasail from peak to peak in the San
Gabriel Mountains, California condor No. 14 swooped to within 6 feet
of his chute.</TE>
<TE>   The bird startled Macklow at first. He dipped his right side and
No. 14 dipped to the right. He curled in the edges of his chute. No.
14 curled in his wingtips.</TE>
<TE>   "I was worried he'd get tangled in my cords," Macklow said. "I
could see the headline now: 'Last Condor in L.A. Killed by Jim
Macklow.'"</TE>
<TE>   The birds probably nest at the condor sanctuary in the Ventura
County portion of Los Padres National Forest and visit Los Angeles
occasionally, said Susie Kasielke, curator of birds at the Los
Angeles Zoo. No. 14 is 2 or 3 years old, bred in either the Los
Angeles Zoo or San Diego Wild Animal Park, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Older birds spend most of their time seeking and defending nests,
mostly in Ventura County," Kasielke said. "Only the younger birds
have time to soar around Los Angeles looking for food."</TE>
<TE>   Condors find the thermal currents they need by watching other
gliders, Kasielke said, which could explain their affinity for hang
gliders.</TE>
<TE>   The skies were busy as hang gliders and condor circled each other.
Jets banked into Burbank Airport, cutting off the flight path to the
south.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, two fighter jets practiced for the Dodgers' opening
day, a Sheriff's Department helicopter landed on a nearby ridge and
private planes headed in and out of Whiteman Airport.</TE>
<TE>   There are only 182 California condors in the world: 101 in
captivity, 62 in the wild and 19 in facilities awaiting release into
the wild, Kasielke said. But the numbers are up from 21 birds in the
early 1980s, when conservationists began breeding them in zoos and
returning them to their natural habitat.</TE>
<TE>   They fly as fast as 55 mph and as far as 300 miles a day.</TE>
<TE>   None of the gliders has figured out why the reclusive condors come
so close to humans, but one who identified himself only as Jellyfish
offered a theory.</TE>
<TE>   "All we've seen are condors with even numbers, meaning they're
males," said Jellyfish, a nuclear power plant worker. "They're
getting a close look at our wings to look for odd numbers."</TE>

<HD>South Gate Rejects State Demand Over Elections</HD>
<DH>Politics: The city refuses to cede electoral
responsibilities to the county, setting the stage for a legal
showdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an unusual challenge to the state's top elections official, South
Gate has refused to comply with his order to hand over its electoral
process to county officials.</LD>
<LD>   The action sets the stage for a legal showdown that would weigh
how much control the state can wield in certain local contests.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council voted late Monday night to reinstate its
appointed elections officer after a city attorney said Secretary of
State Bill Jones' accusations of electoral fraud were "baseless."</LD>
<TE>   "The alleged findings in his order are not supported by any
specific evidence," said special counsel Eduardo Olivo in his
opinion, adding that Jones has "no power regarding the conduct of
local elections."</TE>
<TE>   But state officials repeated their accusation that South Gate
officials tried to undermine recall efforts when they stripped the
elected city clerk of her duties last year and installed their
official.</TE>
<TE>   The state officials said they will seek court action to compel
South Gate to comply and do not rule out filing criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   "There has never been a city that openly defied an order of the
secretary of state," said Alfie Charles, a Jones spokesman. "The
people in South Gate must have full and fair access to the elections
process without any interference from the local political machine."</TE>
<TE>   The city's action comes as a voter recall drive targeting some
city leaders picks up steam. Recall proponents say they collected and
turned in more than the approximately 5,500 signatures needed to
force an election. The targets, Treasurer Albert Robles and three
council allies, are accused of corruption, charges they deny.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy centers on who should supervise a recall vote. The
council majority stripped City Clerk Carmen Avalos of her duties,
saying she was biased because she was the target of a recall herself.</TE>
<TE>   But recall proponents said the fix was in when the targeted
officials brought in Julia Sylva, an attorney who has represented
some of Robles' political allies.</TE>
<TE>   Sylva has represented Richard Mayer, a former council candidate
who ran on a Robles-backed slate. Sylva acted on Mayer's behalf when
he was a director for the Central Basin Municipal Water District,
according to a 1997 letter she wrote to the district.</TE>
<TE>   Jones says Sylva "cynically" manipulated the recall process in
favor of the council, and last month he gave the city two options:
reinstate Avalos or give the duties to the county registrar-recorder.</TE>
<TE>   State officials are weighing their options, which include seeking
a civil action to force compliance. They could also charge officials
with failing to follow their electoral duties, a potential felony
violation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the recall petitions remain under lock and key at the
county registrar's office, where a judge last week ordered they be
held until the situation is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Sylva says she is impartial, but recall proponents fear she will
throw out the recalls.</TE>
<TE>   The legal battle could delay the recall process several months. A
recall election can't be scheduled until the signatures are verified,
and that won't occur until the dispute with the state is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say that challenges to the secretary of state's
authority are rare and that the case could test the scope of his
powers.</TE>
<TE>   "The state has an interest in preventing corruption, but when it
involves a local election, there's an interest in local autonomy, and
whether the people living in the area should be ultimately
responsible on how an election is conducted," said Rick Hasen, a
Loyola Law School professor.</TE>

<HD>Citizenship Scam Dupes Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Crime: INS says Koreans, Filipinos paid up to $25,000 each
to fast-track the application process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four people were arrested Tuesday on charges of participating in a
novel immigration scam in which one suspect allegedly donned a black
robe and posed as a judge to swear in victims as U.S. citizens.</LD>
<LD>   The deception included a quiz on American history and politics and
an obligatory Pledge of Allegiance, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew
Cowan.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the victims were Korean and Filipino nationals who shelled
out as much as $25,000 each after being promised that their
immigration applications would receive fast-track processing.</LD>
<TE>   Cowan said the suspected ring leader, Elzbieta Malgorzata
Bugajska, 50, of Los Angeles told applicants that she was a federal
judge with authority to bypass normal bureaucratic procedures in
obtaining citizenship. Also charged in the fraud case were John
Patrick Bradley, 56, of Los Angeles; Yolanda Miel Lubiano, 62, of Sun
Valley; and Lorena Velasquez Garcia, 39, of South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   Victims interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization Service
investigators described a swearing-in ceremony at Lubiano's home in
October 2000, in which Bradley, clad in a judge's robe, conferred
"citizenship" on 14 people.</TE>
<TE>   While reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, they said, Bradley forgot
some words and had to be assisted by one of the immigrants. The
victims' accounts were described in a search warrant affidavit filed
in connection with the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Bugajska also sold genuine Social Security cards for $750 to
immigrants steered to her office by associates, according to
authorities. Garcia, a 15-year employee of the Social Security
Administration, was accused of providing the cards and sharing in the
profits. Lubiano was accused of introducing Filipino clients to
Bugajska and collecting payments from them.</TE>
<TE>   The yearlong probe was conducted by investigators from the INS and
the Social Security Administration.</TE>

<HD>Behavior of Apparent Ding-a-Ling Didn't Ring a Bell With
Alarmed Resident</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What was once strange behavior ...: The Laguna News-Post carried a
police log item about a resident who was alarmed "about a man pacing
up and down in front of his house for at least two hours." Police
investigated "and found that the man was talking to his friend on a
cell phone."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Another strange connection: When an L.A. County sheriff's deputy
pulled over a driver for a traffic violation in a parking lot, the
woman began to sob uncontrollably. The officer walked away to write
the citation, figuring that would give the driver some time to calm
down. Then the deputy's radio blared a call about a screaming woman,
a possible stabbing victim. And the address was the same parking lot.</LD>
<TE>   The deputy looked around but couldn't find any evidence of a
crime, and for good reason, recounted Star News, a department
publication. The 911 call had been made on a cellular phone, not by a
stabbing victim, but by the incoherent recipient of the traffic
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some really foreign languages: You never know what exotic prose
you're going to spot in multilingual Southern California (see
photos). Henk Friezer found a parking sign with an inadvertent touch
of German. Vina Sealtiel came upon a florist's marquee with a
spelling that would make Parisians blanch. And Carlos Araujo saw an
ad for what sounded like a Spanish bird show, not a dance act.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The myth that won't die: At the Oscars, actor Nathan Lane declared
that Walt Disney would be smiling about the new animated movie award
"if he wasn't frozen solid." Actually Disney, who died in 1966, was
cremated and his remains were interred at Forest Lawn in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   But somehow the story arose that his body had been frozen with the
hope it could be resuscitated later. The rumor coincided with
publicity about a body-freezing movement called cryonics. Since then,
emcees of awards shows, which are watched by millions, have no doubt
helped keep the myth alive.</TE>
<TE>   During one Emmys telecast, Paul Resider observed that two networks
(Westinghouse's CBS and General Electric's NBC) are owned by
companies that sell freezers, while a third, ABC, is owned by a
company "whose founder is in a freezer."</TE>
<TE>   And at an Oscars show a few years ago, Billy Crystal cracked that
until the creation of the Mighty Ducks hockey team "the only Disney
on ice was Walt."</TE>
<TE>   Considering the miserable season that the Mighty Ducks are having,
they seem to have fallen through the ice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Ken Ayeroff, continuing the series of memorable
marquee pairings, said: "I recall this twin bill at the
now-demolished Pan Pacific Theater on one of my first dates in the
early 1970s: ROMEO AND JULIET / THE ODD COUPLE."</TE>

<LD>People, people--I go away for a few days and what happens? I come
back and find another mess. Honestly, can't I trust you by
yourselves?</LD>
<LD>   I've had some catching up to do, so let me recap for everyone.</LD>
<LD>   An anonymous letter shows up in some important mailboxes. It says
that Rick Caruso, a gajillionaire developer who is also the head of
the L.A. Police Commission, was meeting privately with five of the
LAPD's brassiest brass a month ago when he called Rep. Maxine Waters
"the bitch Waters."</LD>
<TE>   Why a noise complaint, an offense that might get someone else a
bit of black-and-white back seat therapy--a ride to the station--gets
Caruso the undivided attention of a quintet of LAPD aristocracy, I do
not know. Actually, I do know. He's a gajillionaire developer and
head of the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Two council members want the mayor, Jim Hahn, to hand over
Caruso's head on a pike. So does Waters, who mothered Hahn through
the election but who has been heard to utter that other dirty word,
"recall," because Hahn shocked the socks off L.A. by showing the
guts--or stupidity, your choice--to say he doesn't want Bernard Parks
to be police chief for another five years. Mayor Jimmy--whose father,
Saint Kenny, has a star on the Watts Walk of Fame--says no to firing
Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   That brings us up to Tuesday, to the dandelion-spangled lawn
outside Parker Center, where Danny Bakewell, capo of the Brotherhood
Crusade, who can field more picketers on short notice than the
Teamsters, just has.</TE>
<TE>   A red school bus empties. Protesters collect their signs and begin
marching. This is the second outing for these signs, like "Rick
Caruso! Is This How You Refer to Your Wife?" I covet the one that
says "Bold, Bodacious, Brilliant, but Not a Bitch," but an organizer
says they need to use them again, which tells me this is not going
away soon.</TE>
<TE>   Waters shows up, to cheers. She challenges "little Rickie Caruso."
She's going into that Police Commission meeting, and "if he can't own
up to it, he's a coward."</TE>
<TE>   The multitude steps through the metal detector and into the
hearing room. Caruso won't be there, the staff announces, and the
groan is heard all the way down the hallway from the overflow crowd.
The Police Commission's executive director, Joe Gunn, says this is a
special meeting, that the original meeting was canceled. "He's a
liar," says Waters, from her front-row seat. Gunn says he will excuse
the congresswoman, a remark that the crowd misses.</TE>
<TE>   Time out. This is not really about the b-word. This is not even
about Waters. She is not a timid and frail creature--she couldn't be,
and be where she is today. She has said that "I don't have time to be
polite." She has called the first George Bush "a racist." She said
Caruso "plays the game very well." So does she.</TE>
<TE>   This is about the p-word, power.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Parker Center, Ted Hayes, the iconoclastic homeless
activist, is debating S. Deacon Alexander, a local Green Party
leader, about whether anyone is free to be a jerk in private. Yes,
says Hayes; Caruso was stupid but he has a right to be, and to take
the consequences. No, says Alexander; violent language begets
violence, wherever it's used.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Bakewell takes the lectern. If the b-word keeps getting
batted around, "it's Maxine Waters today, your mother tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Way too late: It occurs to me, as it did the writer Earl Ofari
Hutchinson and others, that the b-word, like the n-word, has already
been stuck to people's mothers--and sisters and wives and
girlfriends, and profitably so.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail commentary, Hutchinson warns that Caruso's critics
"will appear to be hypocrites for screaming loudly about the alleged
gender slur of Caruso, but not about the tidal wave of slurs by
endless legions of black rappers, filmmakers and writers ... [who]
hack up the image of black women in their songs, films and street
rap."</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, I didn't see Bakewell picketing when Barbara
Bush coyly insulted then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro as a "rich--I can't
say it, but it rhymes with rich." Or marching on Capitol Hill after
Newt Gingrich's mom said her son had used the same vulgarity to
describe Hillary Clinton. And I don't recall hearing of his picketing
record companies and musicians making millions on rap music about
b-this and b-that.</TE>
<TE>   It's an ugly word, and the LAPD has enough gender problems--the
Christopher Commission reported on female officers being derided by
fellow cops--without the head of the Police Commission getting into
the act.</TE>
<TE>   We're a month away from the 10th anniversary of the riots; can't
we all just get a long, long way away from this same old bushwah?</TE>

<HD>Closed-Meeting Critics Target County Counsel</HD>
<DH>Government: Board is urged to drop legal advisor from its
debate because he also has been accused of violating laws on secret
sessions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under fire for holding secret meetings and making decisions out of
public view, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors was urged
Tuesday to drop their county counsel from further deliberations on
the topic, as that lawyer also is accused of violating state
open-meetings laws.</LD>
<LD>   The suggestion came from 1st Amendment advocates who appeared at
the supervisors' weekly meeting. It was the latest escalation in a
growing debate over the board's handling of matters behind closed
doors.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it would be important for the board to get an independent
legal opinion," said Richard McKee, president of the California First
Amendment Coalition. County Counsel Lloyd Pellman "has some standing
opinions and some involvement in past practice that might make it
difficult for that office to be open to new ideas," McKee said.</LD>
<TE>   In a private meeting Dec. 18, Pellman suggested that the board
might be able to kill a proposed initiative to raise the salaries of
low-paid home health-care aides if Pellman simply ignored his
responsibility to give the measure a title and summary. Without
those, proponents would not be allowed to begin gathering ballot
signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Pellman changed course the following day, phoning a majority of
the board members to gauge their reaction. That step, according to
Supervisor Gloria Molina and others, compounded his original error by
violating open-meetings laws.</TE>
<TE>   Details of those meetings became public this month when the county
denied a public-records request by The Times for details of those
meetings, but then inadvertently included the same records requested.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said they will discuss McKee's suggestion next week
during a hearing to air critics' allegations that the county refuses
to adhere to open-meetings and public-records laws.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors did not immediately act on the suggestion that
they find another lawyer to advise them on issues related to public
records and open meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The board has been criticized in recent weeks, after revelations
of its secret 4-1 vote to kill the health-worker initiative. Critics
have seized the opportunity to complain about long-standing county
practices that they say violate the law.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors meet individually with their chief administrator
Monday before the Tuesday meetings, and supervisors' staff members
meet with each other and department heads to debate upcoming matters
before the board.</TE>
<TE>   A review by The Times of a year's worth of board meetings found
that supervisors publicly discuss only 7% of the items before them
for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who recommended that the board hold
next week's hearing, on Tuesday proposed a number of policy changes
for discussion. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * allowing public access to meetings where supervisors discuss
items that will come to the board for decision;</TE>
<TE>   * creating a policy prohibiting the discipline of county staff
members for failing to follow board directives that violate the law;</TE>
<TE>   * instituting a countywide policy of releasing official documents
to the public as soon as they are available to officials;</TE>
<TE>   * training county staff and committee, task force and commission
members on county policy of expediting press requests and
open-meetings laws;</TE>
<TE>   * posting transcripts of the board meetings on the county Web site
and expanding the types of supporting documents that accompany the
agenda on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Don Knabe called the suggestions a "classic
overreaction," a sign of increasing tension among board members.</TE>
<TE>   Since the release of documents related to the health-care
initiative put the supervisors' actions under scrutiny, each board
member except Mike Antonovich has proposed a solution or study of the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Antonovich continued to argue that open-government
laws only apply to a portion of the board's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The law also recognizes that the Board of Supervisors has
legislative, executive and quasi-judicial authority," he said. "You
have to understand what role we're playing when we take the actions
that we do take."</TE>
<TE>   Other board members have proposed a variety of solutions. Knabe on
Tuesday referred to most of those efforts as "wonderful, do-gooder
motions."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke has asked for a countywide
public-records policy that makes the county counsel the ultimate
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Molina has urged tape-recording closed-door board meetings. She
and Knabe have asked the county counsel to reconcile conflicting
decisions on whether meetings of board staff members to discuss
pending business should be public.</TE>

<CX>   Supervisors' meetings--A story in Wednesday's California section
incorrectly described one aspect of a proposal to broaden public access
to Los Angeles County government. Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky on Tuesday
suggested, among other things, that the public should be allowed to

they reach the board for approval.</CX>

<HD>City Panel to Explore Land Trust to Build Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles City Council committee Tuesday agreed to explore the
possibility of setting up an urban land trust to develop more parks
in the city's most populated areas.</LD>
<LD>   The trust, which will be modeled after similar programs in
Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia, would serve as a liaison
between the community and City Hall in an effort to transform vacant
lots and neglected buildings into a network of green oases.</LD>
<LD>   "The time has come to look at land-use planning differently,"
community activist Misty Sanford told the council's Arts, Health and
Humanities Committee. "We cannot let this opportunity pass us by."</LD>
<TE>   Under the plan approved Tuesday by the committee, a coalition of
city and community leaders will meet in the coming weeks to figure
out how to set up the land trust, which would be funded partly with
grants from private companies. The council would then take up the
matter, possibly this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal should be one day that everyone has some sort of park
within walking distance from where they live, where every kid can go
and play," said Councilman Eric Garcetti, who will oversee efforts to
set up the trust. "The land trust is a way of making sure that every
last acre we can get gets greened."</TE>
<TE>   Sanford, a policy analyst with Environmental Defense, said a study
conducted by her group found that the five poorest City Council
districts have 17% of the city's park resources, whereas the five
wealthiest have 50%.</TE>
<TE>   "That leaves the low-income communities and communities of color
in the densely populated urban core of Los Angeles with an average of
0.445 acres of park space per 1,000 residents, less than 5% of the
national standards," Sanford said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti, who represents parts of Hollywood and sits on the Arts,
Health and Humanities Committee, said his goal is to increase the
number of parks in Los Angeles by 50% over the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The urban land trust is long overdue in this city," Garcetti
said. "If we can do this, this will be one of the biggest things we
accomplish in our time here."</TE>
<TE>   At Garcetti's direction, the working group will report back with
its findings in 60 days.</TE>

<HD>State Loan to Salvage Toxic Site</HD>

<DL>RIVERSIDE</DL>
<LD>Touting a program to turn toxic former industrial sites into
neighborhoods, state officials gave developers a $700,000 loan
Tuesday to help turn a former battery recycling facility in Murietta
into a 50-home community.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Toxic Substances Control delivered
the money through a 2-year-old program known as CLEAN--Cleanup Loan
and Environmental Assistance to Neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   The loans target California's "brownfields"--mostly abandoned
pieces of industrial property with a history of pollution and other
environmental problems. With the money secured Tuesday, a development
team called Crossroads Investors III will clean up a 20-acre property
on Adams Avenue in Murietta, near Interstate 15 in southern Riverside
County.</LD>
<TE>   Between 1955 and 1960, the site was used as a lead battery
recycling facility. Riverside County health inspectors have found
elevated levels of lead on the site, which will be treated with the
loan money.</TE>
<TE>   This is the sixth loan issued through the program. The loans have
been worth a total of about $5.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southern California loans have included $950,000 to clean up
a former chemical manufacturing company in Santa Fe Springs and $1
million to clean up a former paint and lacquer manufacturer in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Navy Jets' Downtown Flyover a Practice for Dodger Opening</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Navy jets rattled nerves in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday as they
made a practice run for opening day next week at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   An F-14 Tomcat and an F-4 Phantom sped over the stadium and part
of the Civic Center about 2:30 p.m. in preparation for the Dodgers'
first game next Tuesday, against the San Francisco Giants. The jets
will fly over the stadium at the end of the national anthem, a Dodger
spokesperson said.</LD>
<LD>   The noise frayed nerves at the 25-story headquarters of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</LD>
<TE>   "It seemed way too close. We were certainly startled," said Ed
Scannell, an MTA spokesman. LAPD Officer Jack Richter said he fielded
numerous calls from officers asking what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   Construction worker Mike Melton, 34, wondered whether the military
jets were scrambling against a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured it was one of those fighter planes buzzing around to
keep another plane from these tall buildings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fighter jets took off from the Naval Weapons Test Squadron at
Point Mugu, said Doris Lance, a Navy spokesperson.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy said it didn't mean to frighten people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite an imposing sound. We regret some people thought it
might be a threat," Lance said. "It is out of the ordinary, and
perhaps people did have cause for concern. In a way it's a good
thing, actually; it shows that our awareness level has been raised."</TE>

<HD>Subway Builder Is Ordered to Pay MTA Legal Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ordered the principal builder
of the city's subway line to pay nearly $22 million in legal fees to
the MTA, adding to the $29.5-million judgment against the contractor
last summer for shoddy construction work.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Joseph R. Kalin's action Monday was the latest blow in the
case against construction giant Tutor-Saliba Corp. The judge found
the company liable last year for using minority-owned subcontractors
as fronts, for more than 1,000 incidences of unfair business
practices and for turning in false payment claims relating to
construction of the Los Angeles Red Line subway in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   The judge abruptly cut off testimony in the case last July, ending
a six-year legal struggle. A jury then awarded the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority the $29.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   In October, Kalin turned down an appeal of that decision and
ordered Tutor-Saliba to pay an additional $2.4 million in interest
penalties. Later, he added roughly $9 million to the award to
reimburse the MTA for other litigation costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are obviously elated," MTA chief counsel Steve Carnevale said
of the judge's award of legal fees. "This was a continued message
from the judge to the contractor. He shared our annoyance as to the
way this case was handled.... It was a fight to get everything from
their side all throughout the case."</TE>
<TE>   Tutor-Saliba President Ron Tutor would not comment. However his
lawyer, Nomi Castle, said the company would appeal the order. She
argued that Kalin has treated Tutor-Saliba unfairly during the case.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a gross miscarriage of justice," she said, adding that
Monday's ruling comes as "no surprise" in light of Kalin's previous
awards.</TE>
<TE>   Tutor-Saliba is one of the largest public works contractors in
California. Among its other projects are the Alameda Corridor freight
rail project in Los Angeles and the San Francisco International
Airport expansion.</TE>

<LD>A group has filed a petition to recall a school board member whom
they accuse of pushing illegally for bilingual education and
neglecting parents' concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Beatriz Salas, one of those who filed papers with the Orange
County registrar Monday, alleged that Santa Ana Unified School
District trustee Nativo V. Lopez directed district teachers to
encourage parents to sign waivers so their children would be exempt
from English-immersion classes. She also said Lopez, a Latino
activist, ignored concerned parents unless they supported his
political causes.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez, who was elected in 2000, strongly denied the allegations.</LD>

<HD>Hospital Files for Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Health care: Parkview in Riverside makes the move after
inspectors detailed problems at the struggling facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of devastating state and federal inspection reports that
ripped crucial accreditation status away from Parkview Community
Hospital, the financially floundering care facility has filed for
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the Chapter 11 filing, officials said they will keep the
struggling hospital open while they reorganize and consider
alternatives, such as allowing Riverside County to run the hospital's
emergency room. "We look at this as a positive move," said Parkview
spokesman David Jarrard. "It gives us time to recover from the damage
that has been done to our hospital in recent weeks."</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Naugle approved a request
from Parkview to accept $7 million from a financing company to pay
expenses in the coming year.</LD>
<TE>   Parkview was barred from participating in the state's Medicare and
Medi-Cal programs in February after inspectors said the hospital
posed "immediate jeopardy" to the health and safety of patients. It
was a crucial blow for the already struggling hospital, which has
lost more than $30 million since 1995. Nearly 70% of the hospital's
funding comes from Medicare and Medi-Cal patients.</TE>
<TE>   A prestigious hospital surveying company also yanked the
hospital's accreditation, which about 80% of the country's hospitals
hold.</TE>
<TE>   Although a detailed report on the problems at Parkview won't be
available for several weeks, most of the major problems focused on
how medications were administered to patients, hospital staffers
said.</TE>
<TE>   The blows have outraged the many in the community, which relies
heavily on the hospital known for catering to the city's poor and
uninsured. A rally was held earlier this month at the hospital, and
employees have taken to wearing blue ribbons in a show of support.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, inspectors agreed to put a temporary hold on their
findings, giving Parkview time to fix problems. State inspectors will
return May 15.</TE>
<TE>   But the flap has already cost the hospital millions of dollars,
Jarrard said, including about $4 million the week after inspectors
announced the findings.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse has been the damage to the hospital's reputation.
Several major private health-care insurance companies, such as Blue
Shield and Aetna, pulled their contracts with Parkview, citing a
clause that requires the hospital to participate in the
government-funded health insurance programs. Hospital leaders are now
renegotiating those contracts.</TE>
<TE>   On average, the 193-bed hospital fills between 20 and 30 beds a
day. But it's unlikely the hospital could handle many more patients
because many nurses and other staffers left for jobs elsewhere in an
effort to avoid being laid off. Staffing levels have plummeted by
one-third throughout the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic drops in revenue and personnel have forced the
hospital to close its cancer and pediatric units and to no longer
accept ambulance traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The courts will monitor the hospital's reorganization efforts in
the next 12 months, Jarrard said. A new financial partner may also be
considered.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Riverside County officials have asked a consultant to
look into the cost of running Parkview's nearly defunct emergency
room, turning it into a satellite office for the county's main
hospital in Moreno Valley. County Executive Officer Larry Parish said
the move could ensure that some of the city's poorest retain easy
access to health care.</TE>
<TE>   "We are an extremely large geographic county, with health needs
that stretch all the way to Blythe," Parish said. "But there are
concerns that we don't react so quickly that we become owners of the
problem before we make sure we have the resources to manage it."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the bankruptcy filing Monday in Riverside, Jarrard said
staff morale remains high.</TE>
<TE>   "What they see from the board now is a commitment to remain in a
community hospital and to continue to serve patients," Jarrard said.
"And just knowing there's some momentum is heartening."</TE>

<HD>Chesterfield Square Area Glad to Add a Starbucks</HD>
<DH>Retail: Local residents welcome the coffee house and sports
figures Magic Johnson and Keyshawn Johnson's investments.</DH>

<LD>Gertrude Dillard is not much of a coffee drinker. But Tuesday
morning, Dillard, along with hundreds of others, lingered for hours
at her neighborhood Starbucks.</LD>
<LD>   The cafe's grand opening in Chesterfield Square, a shopping center
in South-Central Los Angeles, was about more than just coffee. For
many, it symbolized investment in a community long overlooked by
name-brand retailers.</LD>
<LD>   "Typically, places like Starbucks forget about our community,"
said Mckina Brannon, who spent the morning at the coffee shop with
her 10-year-old son. "But we do enjoy coffee too."</LD>
<TE>   In the movie "Training Day," Sgt. Alonzo Harris, an LAPD narcotics
detective played by Denzel Washington, tells his trainee that he
won't find a Starbucks in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   That neglect became opportunity to basketball
star-turned-entrepreneur Earvin "Magic" Johnson. His company, Johnson
Development Corp., and Starbucks formed a 50/50 partnership in 1998,
called Urban Coffee Opportunities, to bring Starbucks into urban
neighborhoods. The Chesterfield Square cafe, at Slauson Avenue and
Western Boulevard, is the 10th Los Angeles location and the 33rd
across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "You deserve to have the best of the best, and we brought you
that," Johnson told the crowd at Tuesday's ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Those there to meet the former Laker were grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have a place to go to get major-league coffee," said
56-year-old Dillard, a hospital worker.</TE>
<TE>   The Starbucks, like other tenants in Chesterfield Square, employs
neighborhood residents. The first day the store accepted
applications, managers received more than 200.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson is hopeful that the venture will not only bring jobs, but
also attract other name-brand stores, in turn increasing property
values in the area.</TE>
<TE>   At 250,000 square feet, Chesterfield Square is the largest
commercial development in South Los Angeles in more than a decade. A
Home Depot, Food4Less, Subway and McDonald's also share the shopping
center.</TE>
<TE>   Attracting brands such as Starbucks is critical to the
development, said Gerald Katell, president of Katell Properties.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these entities are national brands," Katell said. "The
community wanted a shopping center like one that would be in West
L.A. or like anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   The center, painted in Mediterranean hues, is a stark contrast to
surrounding businesses, some of which are in dilapidated buildings or
have bars on their windows.</TE>
<TE>   The celebration of the grand opening drew several hundred
residents and schoolchildren, two radio stations and local officials
such as Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay Buccaneer and L.A. native Keyshawn Johnson, an investor
in the Chesterfield Square development, was also on hand. He is also
investing in the Santa Barbara Plaza in Crenshaw.</TE>
<TE>   Parks congratulated both for their efforts. "The best crime
deterrent is employment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lim Horn, owner of a nearby doughnut shop, said he doesn't fear
the competition from the new Starbucks. "There is already a lot of
coffee around here," Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the people around here need cheap coffee. Starbucks is
expensive. I can sell coffee for 75 cents."</TE>

<HD>Alleged Slur Brings Call for Caruso to Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and several dozen supporters
crammed a Los Angeles Police Commission meeting Tuesday, demanding
that commission President Rick Caruso resign because he allegedly
used a slur in referring to the congresswoman.</LD>
<LD>   Waters and others criticized Caruso during a public comment period
that lasted two hours.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of people who could not fit inside the meeting room at
Parker Center lined the hallway outside, listening to the comments
over a loudspeaker.</LD>
<TE>   Caruso, who has declined to comment on the matter, did not attend
the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is all right for the Police Commission president to call a
congresswoman a bitch, is it all right for police officers on the
street to call women bitches?" Waters asked the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Brotherhood Crusade President Danny Bakewell called the commission
president a coward for not attending the meeting and demanded a
formal apology from him and the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It outrages all of us who are citizens of the city of Los
Angeles," Bakewell said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, about 100 people rallied outside the Los Angeles
Police Department's downtown headquarters, where the commission meets
weekly, chanting and carrying protest signs with slogans such as
"Caruso Must Go."</TE>
<TE>   The five-member commission is deliberating whether to appoint
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, whose supporters include Waters, to a
second five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso was appointed by Mayor James K. Hahn, who opposes the
chief's reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's alleged comment was distributed in a letter from an
anonymous person who claimed to have been at a Feb. 28 meeting
attended by Caruso and several top police officials.</TE>
<TE>   "This is wrong," said Ron Williams, who attended the rally in
support of Waters, as he held up a brightly colored protest sign.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to be a leader, you don't make this kind of
mistake."</TE>

<HD>Davis Says Simon Could Roll Back Abortion Rights if Elected
Governor</HD>
<DH>Politics: He says state's chief executive wields influence
on the issue, though his challenger prefers not to discuss it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, striving to focus voters' attention on social
matters, warned Tuesday that his Republican challenger, Bill Simon
Jr., could roll back abortion rights, and he charged that Simon's
attempt to avoid talk of abortion is a slap at voters.</LD>
<LD>   Davis used the occasion of receiving the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League's endorsement to renew his attack
on Simon's opposition to abortion.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an issue where the differences are stark, crystal clear,"
Davis said. "He is on one side and I'm on the other side."</LD>
<TE>   Simon acknowledges that he opposes abortion, but seeks to aim his
campaign at Davis' handling of the energy crisis, schools and the
economy. "Gray Davis has to focus on these wedge issues," Simon
campaign spokesman Jamie Fisfis said, "because on the issues that
unite Californians, like the economy, schools and energy, he has a
failed track record."</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis languishes in public opinion surveys, his stand on
abortion rights is in sync with most Californians, and it has been a
winning issue for him in campaigns. He defeated his 1998 opponent,
former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, in part by focusing on Lungren's
opposition to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   And Davis took the extraordinary step of spending more than $8
million in this year's Republican primary, airing television ads
criticizing former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's ambiguous
position on abortion rights. Many political experts had assumed
Riordan would have been Davis' toughest foe in the November general
election.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Davis is contrasting his stand on abortion rights, gun
control and other social issues with the more conservative positions
held by Simon. Davis has scheduled another event today underscoring
steps he has taken to ensure that health maintenance organizations
provide women with contraceptives and other family planning services.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say you're changing the subject," Davis said, "it is
like a slap in the face to voters. It is not our decision. It's the
voters' decision as to what they want to talk about, and clearly this
is an issue of concern to lots of Californians."</TE>
<TE>   The governor said all 180 judges he has appointed embrace the
state's constitutional protection of privacy, which ensures that
women have a right under state law to obtain abortions. He pointed to
his budget decisions that increase funding for family planning, and
to bills he has signed to protect access to abortion clinics and
expand the availability of contraceptives.</TE>
<TE>   "There are clearly things a governor can do to enhance or diminish
a woman's right to chose," Davis said. "People in this state want a
governor who will add to that right, not subtract from that."</TE>
<TE>   Davis questioned whether Simon would have signed the measures.
Fisfis said Simon has "made a policy of not to comment on individual
pieces of legislation."</TE>
<TE>   "If Bill is elected governor," Fisfis said, "he will use his
mandate to address issues: the economy, schools and the
quality-of-life issue, energy, roads and water."</TE>
<TE>   In endorsing Davis, Kate Michelman, president of the abortion
rights league, called him a "model governor" on abortion rights and
family planning issues. She added that the issue is important for
voters when they seek to determine a candidate's "values."</TE>
<TE>   "The issue isn't abortion," Michelman said. "The issue is, 'Who
decides?' The issue is the right of women to control their own
lives.... Once voters know the way a candidate views the right to
choose, and the role of government versus women, it will often move
voters right to that pro-choice candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Political consultants said the issue's impact come November will
depend on the candidates' ability to shape the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Its importance, said Republican consultant Wayne Johnson, is
"strictly a function of whether the Simon campaign rises to the bait
and allows the campaign to be pulled off-message." Simon needs to
focus on the budget deficit and taxes, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Davis] succeeds in making it about issues that are not really
the most important in the state," Johnson said, "that means one of
the two teams didn't show up to play--and I can guarantee you the
Simon team will show up."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic consultant Gale Kaufman, in a separate interview, said
Davis is correct: "It is a pivotal issue. Symbolically, a woman's
right to choose is very visceral.... And in a governor's race, when
you're going to run the state, they want to know where you stand on
that issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer [Davis] can keep voters focused on that issue,"
Kaufman added, "the better the election is going to go."</TE>

<HD>Man Kills His Ex-Wife's 4 Children, Self</HD>
<DH>Violence: The gunman, an ex-sheriff's deputy, entered the
house while victims' mother was out for a walk, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ex-husband of a Merced veterinarian walked into her home Tuesday
morning in one of the town's best neighborhoods, shot to death her
four children and then killed himself, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   John P. Hogan, a former Santa Clara County sheriff's deputy, was
found dead on his ex-wife's bed, holding the body of their 5-year
old, Michelle.</LD>
<LD>   The other victims--who were not Hogan's children--had been killed
in other parts of the four-bedroom house in Robinson Estates, just
outside the city. Melanie, 17, the oldest, was lying in a hallway
outside her bedroom. Her two brothers, Stanley, 15, and Stuart, 14,
apparently had been shot while asleep in their bedrooms, said Sgt.
Tom Cavallero of the Merced County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   Hogan's ex-wife, Christine McFadden, returned to the scene from a
morning walk with a neighbor shortly after 7 a.m. Hogan's car was
parked outside. She saw Melanie's body, went to her neighbor's home
and called police. Deputies found the other children when they
arrived and searched the house. A handgun lay on the bed next to
Hogan and Michelle.</TE>
<TE>   Cavallero said investigators were treating the slayings as a
murder-suicide, but did not know the motive.</TE>
<TE>   McFadden is well-known in the community and runs one of the larger
veterinary practices in town. She and Hogan had been divorced for
about a year.</TE>
<TE>   ''Her kids were everything to her,'' said Dr. Leah Hill, a friend
and fellow veterinarian. ''This is the most devastating thing I've
ever heard.''</TE>
<TE>   The children were extroverted, bright and well-liked, school
administrators said Tuesday as stunned students mourned.</TE>
<TE>   At Our Lady of Mercy Catholic school, which all four had attended,
hundreds of students, parents and graduates jammed into the gym for a
Mass on Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-graders left a seat empty for their dead classmate,
Stuart. His portrait had been placed on the chair, along with flowers
and balls from the three athletic teams he played on: basketball,
baseball and soccer. ''It was very difficult,'' said Father Mike
Lastiri, the pastor of Our Lady of Mercy-St. Patrick's Church. As a
deacon he had baptized Melanie 17 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At Golden Valley High School, where Melanie was a junior and
Stanley a freshman, the principal announced their deaths over the
public address system soon after classes began.</TE>
<TE>   Melanie was running for vice president of next year's senior class
in an election set for the end of this week, said Principal Ralf
Swenson. Friends quietly removed her campaign posters from the school
quad.</TE>
<TE>   ''They were very positive and engaging kids,'' Swenson said.
''It's unbelievable anybody would do this.''</TE>
<TE>   Melanie was a cheerleader, a straight-A student and prize-winning
member of the speech team who had her sights set on an Ivy League
college and medical studies. Stanley played football and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart had recently been a hit in a comic role in a school
performance, said Our Lady of Mercy Principal Brenda Feehan.
Michelle, the baby of the family, attended preschool there.</TE>
<TE>   McFadden started her practice in Merced about 20 years ago with
her first husband, Thomas Willis. He is the father of the three
oldest children, who bore his last name.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had little information on Hogan, 49. He left the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Department on a medical retirement in 1993
after 10 years with the force. Cavallero said Hogan had done private
investigative work and lived in the Merced area after he and McFadden
divorced.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Grocers Keep Current by Going Kosher</HD>
<DH>Food: Mainstream supermarkets are, increasingly, catering
to the burgeoning local Jewish population. Many are fully stocked
with Passover products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Bernice Tabak went shopping at her local Albertsons in Irvine
last week, she was delighted to find exactly what she was looking
for: a chicken.</LD>
<LD>   Not just any chicken. "Fresh kosher chicken," she said. "Not
frozen fresh, but fresh."</LD>
<LD>   As Orange County's Jewish population has grown in recent years, so
too has the number of mainstream grocery stores offering a wide range
of kosher foods--in particular, Passover products adhering to strict
dietary guidelines governing the eight-day holiday that commemorates
the deliverance of Jews from slavery.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been here in Orange County for 22 years," said Tabak,
principal of the Tarbut V'Torah Community Day School in Irvine. "When
I first got here, you could find virtually nothing kosher." There was
one kosher market in Los Alamitos, she said, "or you had to go to
L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Rabbi Arnold Rachlis of University Synagogue in Irvine put
it: "To commemorate the exodus from Egypt, [Jews] had to make the
exodus from Orange County just to stock up on food."</TE>
<TE>   No more. As the county's 80,000 to 100,000 Jews prepare
traditional Seders beginning tonight, they're increasingly finding
there's no need to trek to Los Angeles' Fairfax district or the
Pico-Robertson neighborhood to find everything from bitter herbs and
the ingredients for sweet charoset to pastries without leavening and
kosher meats.</TE>
<TE>   No, Ralphs, Vons, Albertsons and Stater Brothers will do just
fine.</TE>
<TE>   "Two things have happened in Orange County," said Gregory
Nathanson, a manager for Gourmet Award Foods in Los Angeles, the
biggest distributor of kosher products outside New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "Our company has shown the major retailers that the community was
moving there. The second part is that supermarkets have become much
more sophisticated" about catering to the needs of ethnic consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of specialty kosher products in Orange County have doubled
in the past five years, Nathanson said, although he estimated that
75% of those sales are concentrated at only four stores--two in
Irvine and two in Laguna Woods. A decade ago, he said, the Orange
County market was minuscule.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, we only merchandised kosher products at stores
that shopped very heavily kosher," mostly on L.A.'s Westside, said
Karen Ramos, a spokeswoman for Albertsons. "What we found is that
kosher customers are everywhere. They're not just concentrated in
pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ramos said, 237 Albertsons in Southern California--the vast
majority of them--have Passover displays. The biggest growth has been
in Orange and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a recognition of the growth of the Jewish community. But
it's also a recognition that ... not everybody who buys kosher foods
is Jewish," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the growth of the kosher market in Orange County mirrors a
national trend. About 18,000 of the 30,000 grocery stores in the
United States now have a kosher section--up from 3,000 a decade ago,
said Menachem Lubinsky, whose New York marketing firm publishes the
trade paper Kosher Today.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, consumers spent about $5.75 billion on kosher foods,
nearly twice as much as in 1996, Lubinsky said. It's a market being
propelled not only by Jews but by Muslims, vegetarians and consumers
seeking healthier food.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a lot of people crossing over to the kosher
experience," Lubinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the kosher experience for some Jews in Orange County
means a trip to the markets, butchers and bakeries in Los Angeles
where they've shopped for years.</TE>
<TE>   For Marla Kaufman, the trek is a Passover tradition unique to
Southern California. Last week, Kaufman, who has lived in Orange
County for nine years, journeyed to Pico-Robertson and shopped for
three families, spending $500.</TE>
<TE>   "I came from there; I have friends who I left behind there," said
Kaufman, 42. "You can be having lunch and see a teenager
roller-blading by with a ... yarmulke, and you feel like you're in
more of a Jewish neighborhood. There's a flavor there, a bustling of
people.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to buy a box of matzo at Albertsons--it's not the same
thing."</TE>

<HD>Quadruplets' Debut Is an Amazing Sister Act</HD>
<DH>Birth: Identical girls, conceived without outside help, are
a 1-in-11-million event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA and JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>They arrived in quick succession: four genetically identical girls,
conceived without fertilization drugs and delivered minutes apart
Monday at Sutter Memorial Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The odds of that occurring are 1 in 11 million, said Dr. Alex
Mentakis, who delivered the quadruplets by caesarean section to
22-year-old Ornsee Khamsa.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a wonderful experience, one that you're never going to have
again in your life," Mentakis said.</LD>
<TE>   The girls were born from a single egg fertilized by a single sperm
cell. They shared a single placenta, although each had a separate
amniotic sac, Mentakis said.</TE>
<TE>   They were born at 30 weeks, and the largest weighs 2 pounds, 8
ounces. But given the complications that often afflict multiple
births, and given that their parents, young and without insurance,
waited until Khamsa was 20 weeks pregnant to get prenatal care, the
girls are remarkably healthy, Mentakis said. Only one briefly
required a breathing tube.</TE>
<TE>   "They were pink, they were kicking, and they were crying, which is
what you want to see," he said. "It's incredible that they made it
this far so healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Khamsa and her husband, 20-year-old Verek Muy, are Laotian
immigrants who live in West Sacramento. They have a 4-year-old son,
Raymond.</TE>
<TE>   The girls, named Preana, Audreana, Natalie and Melody, probably
will remain in the Sacramento hospital's special care unit for
several weeks, said spokeswoman Linda Pinkham.</TE>
<TE>   Khamsa is "so happy, excited and nervous," said her sister Katie.</TE>
<TE>   Katie, who promised to chauffeur the girls around in her Suburban,
said she hadn't believed her sister at first.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't believe it until a couple of weeks ago," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor, who was assisted by about 30 people during the
delivery, said, "If this happens to me again, I'm going to go out and
buy lottery tickets."</TE>

<HD>200 Airport Workers in West Arrested by INS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of a national enforcement push expected to spread to LAX,
immigration authorities have arrested more than 200 airport workers
in Western states as unlawful immigrants, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest action, 23 workers with security clearances were
detained in the last week or so at Bay Area airports.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative--"Operation Tarmac"--was launched in the weeks
following Sept. 11 to review contract workers for food service firms,
janitorial concerns and others who have access to sensitive airport
areas. Agents are also checking the records of airline employees.</LD>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service so far has examined
paperwork for more than 125,000 airport workers employed at 885
businesses in the Western states, said Virginia Kice, an INS
spokeswoman. Agents have arrested 212 unauthorized workers, including
12 facing federal prosecution for document fraud or related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   None are known to be linked to terrorism, officials stressed.</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Area arrests involved 23 workers employed by businesses
serving San Francisco International Airport and Mineta San Jose
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide operation has also resulted in arrests in Boston,
Salt Lake City, Seattle, Las Vegas and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have refused to discuss specific targets, but several
knowledgeable officials said INS officers were reviewing employment
records at Los Angeles International, the nation's third-busiest
airport. More than 40,000 workers there have security badges giving
them access to sensitive areas.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of airport workers is separate from an ongoing
INS sweep that has resulted in the arrests of 184 suspected illegal
immigrants at LAX since last week. That effort has focused on people
recently smuggled in from Mexico and trying to board flights to other
U.S. destinations.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 2, Burned in Garage Fire</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 2-year-old boy remained in critical condition Tuesday after being
severely burned in a garage fire in Sylmar.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was playing in the garage at his home in the 12900 block
of Phillippi Avenue about 6 p.m. Monday when a clothes dryer pilot
light somehow ignited gasoline spilled on the floor, Los Angeles Fire
Department spokesman Bob Collis said.</LD>
<LD>   ''It was more like a flash fire,'' Collis said. ''That's why the
little guy got burned like he did.''</LD>
<TE>   The child sustained second- and third-degree burns over 60% of his
body. His airway and lungs were also injured, Collis said. The boy
was taken to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills,
where he was stabilized and then transferred to Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center. The boy, whose identity was not released,
remains in the intensive care burn unit there, hospital officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters took 12 minutes to put out the fire, which shot up to
the roof of the garage and the attic of the home.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was a small area that actually burned,'' Collis said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother, Carolina Diaz, 28, was in the frontyard while he
was playing in the garage, Collis said. She suffered second-degree
burns to her left shin and was treated at Holy Cross Medical Center
and released.</TE>

<HD>Juvenile Charged as Adult in Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: The 16-year-old and his brother, 21, face 65 to life
in the shooting of a sheriff's sergeant, who has returned home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors Tuesday charged a 16-year-old reputed gang member as an
adult in connection with the weekend shooting of an Orange County
sheriff's sergeant.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro Valdovinos and brother Miguel Valdovinos, 21, of Santa
Ana are accused in the shooting of Sheriff's Sgt. Kurt Vasentine, 45,
while the officer was checking on a suspicious car parked in a Lake
Forest alley.</LD>
<LD>   They did not enter pleas, and arraignment was continued until
April 9.</LD>
<TE>   A single bullet hit Vasentine in the right cheek at point-blank
range, traveled down his neck and lodged under his right collarbone,
missing vital organs and arteries. He had surgery to remove the
bullet and was released from a Mission Viejo hospital Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Vasentine was resting Tuesday at his Coto de Caza home, where
neighbors had placed a star-shaped sign next to his front door: "Sgt.
Kurt. Our Hero."</TE>
<TE>   He smiled when he saw it, even with a swollen face and a small
scab on his right cheek where the bullet entered.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I look lucky?" Vasentine asked. "Because I feel real lucky."</TE>
<TE>   He said he needed time to recuperate before he felt like talking
more about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   As the shock of Saturday's shooting wears off, the officer needs
"some R&amp;R, big time," said his father, Gene Vasentine. "I'm going to
honestly throw a shield around him," he said. "I saw him Sunday at
the hospital. We had a great sense of humor between us. But after I
left there, I got to thinking, 'My God, I could have been arranging
my son's funeral.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Valdovinos brothers were charged on several counts, including
attempted murder, carjacking, possession of a stolen car and being
gang members in possession of a firearm. If convicted, they could
serve 65 years to life in prison, prosecutor Mark Geller said.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Valdovinos, 16, is also charged with robbery in an
incident a month ago. Although he is a juvenile, prosecutors are
seeking to try him as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   "Based upon the obvious serious nature of the crime, we elected to
do that," said Geller, a deputy district attorney in the Santa Ana
gang unit. "When a 16-year-old shoots a cop in the face, short of a
homicide, there's not much more serious of a case than that."</TE>
<TE>   Vasentine, a 23-year veteran, was shot Saturday morning when he
was checking on a suspicious car. A man in the car tried to run, but
Vasentine wrestled him to the ground. The man pulled a gun from his
pocket and fired at Vasentine, who shot back, hitting the man in the
leg before he fled in a car driven by another man, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In a jailhouse interview Monday, Miguel Valdovinos said neither he
nor his brother was involved. He said they were visiting relatives in
Riverside at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Bail has been set at $1million for each. Miguel Valdovinos is
being held at Orange County Jail. Alejandro Valdovinos is at Juvenile
Hall.</TE>

<HD>Congresswoman: Marines Not Trying to Return to El Toro</HD>
<DH>Military: San Diego representative says commandant told her
there have been no 'in-depth discussions' on moving boot camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. representative whose district includes the Marine Corps boot
camp said Tuesday that Commandant Gen. James Jones assured her he has
not engaged in any "in-depth discussions" about moving the base to
the former El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Susan Davis (D-San Diego) said Jones told her that any
consideration of moving the boot camp, officially called the Marine
Corps Recruit Depot, would be done "in conjunction with the people of
San Diego and their elected representatives."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Rep. Randall "Duke" Cunningham (R-Escondido) said Jones
mentioned to him the idea of moving the base to El Toro.</LD>
<TE>   The Marine Corps immediately issued a statement seeming to
distance itself from Cunningham's assertion, branding the idea as
Cunningham's, not Jones'.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Cunningham suggested moving the boot camp to Camp
Pendleton, a suggestion the Marine Corps studied but rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "After speaking with the commandant of the Marine Corps," Davis
said, "I believe that recent reports about the depot's demise have
been greatly exaggerated."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said the move would be a "win-win," providing more
space for the boot camp at El Toro and room to expand Lindbergh
Field, which is adjacent to the base.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, San Diego Councilman Byron Wear, the city's
representative to the newly formed San Diego Regional Airport
Authority, said the boot camp property would be inadequate to provide
anything but a "Band-Aid" to the airport's crowding problems. Wear
and other officials are searching for a new site for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion to move the boot camp to Orange County was made a
week after the Navy, which oversees the El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station, announced its intent to sell all or part of the 4,700-acre
base, which has been closed since 1999, to private developers.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials are expected to make a final decision about the
former base's future by April 23.</TE>

<HD>In-Car Database New Tool for Deputies</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: 'Breakthrough' in fight against crime will
speed the identification of suspects in the field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW EBNET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County sheriff's deputies will soon be able to access the
Internet and download photographs--from criminal mug shots to DMV
photos--from their squad cars, reducing the time it can take to
identify a suspect.</LD>
<LD>   The technology, tested statewide for the last six months, will
allow deputies to sift through millions of photographs in seconds or
type the barest of descriptions into a search engine and call up the
images of possible suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Officers will also have the ability to create photographic lineups
in the field to show to crime victims and witnesses.</LD>
<TE>   The computer program will be installed at a cost of $9 million in
all 350 Sheriff's Department cruisers in Orange County over the next
18 months.</TE>
<TE>   At a press briefing Tuesday in Santa Ana, state Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer described Cal-Photo as a "breakthrough crime-fighting tool"
that will eventually be standard equipment in every police car.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Michael S. Carona said he will urge police departments
throughout Orange County to install computers in squad cars capable
of running the Cal-Photo program or upgrade computers with the
software.</TE>
<TE>   While police departments across the country have the ability to
transmit photos to officers in the field, Lockyer said, Cal-Photo is
the quickest and most advanced system available.</TE>
<TE>   Officers will be able to access 32 million DMV photos and a
Department of Justice database of more than 200,000 mug shots.
"Pictures can not only replace a thousand words of description, they
can save precious minutes in life-or-death situations," Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV receives about 1,600 requests a day for information and
photos, and much of the work is done by hand, said Maria
Contreras-Sweet, acting secretary of the California Department of
Motor Vehicles, who attended Tuesday's briefing. She said it can take
hours or even days to locate a photo needed by police officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who has ever seen an officer checking a vehicle
registration or a driver's license from a police car knows what a
vital role the massive DMV database plays in law enforcement,"
Contreras-Sweet said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cal-Photo software was designed by programmers with the state
Department of Justice and now is being eyed by law enforcement
agencies across the country, said Sheriff's Capt. Ron Wilkerson.</TE>
<TE>   The system was tested in Orange County, Los Angeles County,
Ventura County, Sacramento, Fresno, San Jose and San Diego. It has
been used since Sept. 11 by the California Anti-Terrorism Information
Center as well as state and federal anti-terrorism task forces to
track suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials need only a license number or the first
three letters of a person's last name to search for a photograph. The
system operates like a search engine, letting officers find photos
with limited information.</TE>
<TE>   Chula Vista police officers this year tracked down a San Diego man
in an assault case using witness statements that the assailant was
white and had an artificial leg. The suspect's picture was later
picked out from a photo lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "It is only a picture," Wilkerson said. "But it is a huge surge of
information in the patrol car."</TE>

<HD>Delgadillo Asked to Review Police Bond</HD>
<DH>Public safety: Valley business group seeks ruling on
legality of Prop. Q in light of an unfavorable opinion by state
legislative counsel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Fernando Valley business group asked city officials Tuesday to
take another look at the legality of Proposition Q, the $600-million
police bond issue that state officials have questioned.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. supported the bond measure,
which city officials said would provide critically needed
improvements in fire and police services. Voters narrowly approved
the measure earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   But VICA conditioned its support on a finding that the bond
measure complied with state law requiring accountability, which state
officials have concluded it does not.</LD>
<TE>   In a March 8 opinion, the state legislative counsel said
Proposition Q did not comply with the Truth in Bonding Act because it
failed to limit the use of bond proceeds to the specific purposes of
the measure, failed to establish a separate account where bond
proceeds would be held and failed to require an annual report and
audit.</TE>
<TE>   VICA board members decided Tuesday to ask Los Angeles City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo to review the state opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that Prop. Q has passed, we would like police and fire
stations to come on line as soon as possible, but we want to make
sure the proposition complies with state law," said Fred Gaines,
chairman of the VICA board.</TE>
<TE>   As of now, the city attorney's office stands behind an earlier
opinion upholding the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe Prop. Q is in compliance of the Truth in Bonding Act,"
said Mary McGuire, a spokeswoman for city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not received a copy of [the VICA request]," she said.
"When we do, we'll give it our full attention."</TE>

<HD>Flames Destroy Surf Shop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Beach Hut, a popular surf shop that became an institution for the
tightly knit community in Ventura's Pierpont district, was destroyed
early Tuesday in a fire that authorities are calling suspicious.</LD>
<LD>   The fire began about 3:45 a.m. in the store at Seaward Avenue and
Pierpont Boulevard, with flames reaching 25 feet, Ventura Fire
Battalion Chief Neil Gedney said.</LD>
<LD>   "It was suspicious in nature," Gedney said. "We don't believe this
was a naturally occurring fire."</LD>
<TE>   Everything inside the small, single-story shop was destroyed.
Damage was estimated at $130,000.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Shock, who lives next door, was awakened by breaking glass.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a party spot, so you hear glass breaking all the time,"
Shock said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, a neighbor knocked on his door to alert him to
the fire.</TE>
<TE>   A jet of water from a fire hose smashed Shock's window and soaked
his carpet.</TE>
<TE>   "I was up to my ankles in water in here," he said. "Then I looked
out and saw the fire."</TE>
<TE>   The colorfully painted Beach Hut, located about 100 yards from the
ocean, sold and rented surfboards, shirts, wetsuits, wax and other
surfing supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The shop sponsored surf contests and various events for children
over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the Beach Hut, man," said one aging surfer riding past the
damaged building. "Surf headquarters for all the good-looking, young
things."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Kodosh, manager of Surf Liquor, which shares a parking lot
with the surf shop, said: "It's a landmark. I'm heartbroken. I'm just
sick.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real close-knit community here," she said. "Everyone
knew the Beach Hut."</TE>
<TE>   Residents say Sandy Crawford recently took over the business. She
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Shelter Renovation to Open More Doors</HD>
<DH>Homeless: Officials say fewer people will be turned away
when the Camarillo facility moves into a larger quarters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving into a new home is always an exciting prospect, but it holds a
special meaning for Diana Vogelbaum.</LD>
<LD>   As the driving force behind the RAIN homeless shelter in
Camarillo, Vogelbaum faces the daily task of telling families that
she doesn't have room for them.</LD>
<LD>   But that will all change come September, when RAIN's newly
renovated shelter is complete.</LD>
<TE>   "The best thing will be there's fewer people I will have to turn
away," said Vogelbaum, the RAIN project manager. "It's no fun to do
that because there's nowhere to turn them."</TE>
<TE>   Located on Lewis Road near the Cal State Channel Islands campus,
the new shelter sits on 21/2 acres and features a 20,000-square-foot,
U-shaped building that was once part of Camarillo State Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Standing two stories high with a red-tiled roof, the shelter will
accommodate 90 residents, as opposed to the 60 who can be squeezed
into the current facility at Camarillo Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Vogelbaum said the majority of residents are families with
children. The new shelter, similar to the current one, will feature a
variety of different-sized rooms to sleep all sizes of families.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't take people on a first-come, first-served basis, it's
more of a first-come, right-size family," Vogelbaum said. "We
generally have 30 to 50 people on the waiting list at a time."</TE>
<TE>   RAIN--short for River-dwellers Aid Innercity Network--dates to
November 1997, when it was formed in advance of the upcoming El Nino
storms.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point was to get the homeless out of the river bottom
before the storms hit and washed them away like in 1995," Vogelbaum
said. "There's not many homeless left in the river bottom, so now it
just means providing shelter from the rain. Luckily, the new shelter
will do that and more."</TE>
<TE>   Features of the new facility include an oversized dining room that
will allow everyone to eat together instead of in shifts; a
commercial kitchen so meals can be cooked inside rather than on an
outdoor barbecue; additional bathrooms; and most importantly, heat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just going to be a much more comfortable situation,"
Vogelbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   With the majority of the project's estimated $1.4-million cost
coming from grants, the budget is still about $200,000 short. To make
up the difference, RAIN has been relying on the help of volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done several Saturday sessions of prep work using
volunteers from the existing shelter and various community groups,"
said Mike Lewicki, project manager for Gafcon, the Los Angeles-based
firm hired by the county to oversee the renovations. "It's been very
cool to see college students working side by side with 85-year-olds."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the multicultural sociology club at CSUN at Channel
Islands--on the future campus of Cal State Channel Islands--are among
those pitching in. Their duties have ranged from cleaning out a
flooded storage shed to pulling up old tile flooring.</TE>
<TE>   "Self-satisfaction is what we get out of it and why we started the
club," said 30-year-old Wendy Henke of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Lewicki said the gutting of the new facility has been done in
advance of the construction contract, which will be put out for bids
at the end of this month. That process generally takes 30 days, so
the renovation work is expected to begin in early May.</TE>
<TE>   "Our target [opening] date is early September, because we want to
be in there and established when the kids go back to school," Lewicki
said.</TE>
<TE>   One of RAIN's requirements is that all children be enrolled in
school. Additionally, the RAIN staff helps residents find a job, with
80% of residents' paychecks placed into a savings account, with the
money eventually going toward moving expenses when residents find a
more permanent home.</TE>
<TE>   Residents' length of stay at the RAIN shelter varies. "We shoot
for six months, but each case is very individual," Vogelbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   The residents also attend parenting and life skills classes, are
assigned chores and have the option of attending one-on-one
counseling sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "The five major reasons for homelessness are mental illness, drug
and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, loss of a job, and death of the
family's bread winner," Vogelbaum said. "We are more than just a
shelter for these people. This is a home."</TE>

<HD>Simi Council Fights SOAR With SOAR</HD>
<DH>Land use: Panel seeks its own slow-growth ballot item to
counter efforts to expand development curbs enacted in 1998.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley council members are gearing up to fight a ballot measure
that would severely restrict the city's expansion plans for two
decades.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member council signaled its intention this week to place
a competing measure on the November ballot that would reaffirm the
growth boundaries enacted by voters four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes weeks after Save Open Space and Agricultural
Resources, the group that enlisted city support for the 1998
boundaries, announced a new move to further rein in development.</LD>
<TE>   Diane Bentz, co-leader of Simi Valley SOAR, said Tuesday she
believes the city wants to confuse voters and dilute support for the
tighter restrictions. "We already know that voters want what they
have. There's no need to reconfirm that," she said. "What we're doing
is seeing whether they want more."</TE>
<TE>   But Mayor Bill Davis said the slow-growth issue has become so
politicized that unless there is a competing plan, voters may
automatically support new restrictions, without considering the
implications.</TE>
<TE>   "They've moved way beyond what was intended by the public when
they started with this," Davis said of SOAR's latest plan. "They're
not saving agriculture or open space. Show me where we're growing
crops in Simi Valley. They're the ones who are doing the confusion."</TE>
<TE>   Davis asserted that the tighter restrictions could force
developers blocked from building homes to turn their property into
landfills. He also warned of construction of high-rise apartments to
accommodate growth. SOAR leaders dispute those claims, saying there
is sufficient land within city limits for new businesses and
moderate-density housing.</TE>
<TE>   Council members, most of whom are conservative Republicans with
business backgrounds, feel betrayed by SOAR activists, Davis said.
Four years ago, council members endorsed establishing growth
boundaries expressly because SOAR leaders agreed to allow for a
handful of developments that city officials wanted. Voters
overwhelmingly backed the compromise boundaries negotiated between
city officials and slow-growth activists.</TE>
<TE>   SOAR's latest plan, which it hopes to place before voters this
fall, would clip Alamos and Brea canyons and Marr and Runkle Canyon
ranches from the city's expansion zone. City leaders say that might
cripple developer Unocal's plans to build The Canyons northwest of
the city.</TE>
<TE>   The Unocal project would comprise 1,600 homes and a business park
the city had identified as a local center of job growth over the next
20 years. SOAR leaders say the project would not create a
jobs-to-housing balance or provide affordable housing, as some
backers suggest, but would merely add to sprawl and traffic
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   At Monday night's meeting, the council voted unanimously to direct
city staff to draw up an alternative to SOAR's new proposal. The
alternative is expected to establish the same, or almost exactly the
same, boundaries that are now in place--boundaries that would permit
the Unocal project to proceed. Council members would need to vote
formally to then place the staff's proposed language on the ballot, a
decision expected by June.</TE>

52, of Oxnard, suffered facial lacerations but declined treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Ayala's pickup hit the bus as it was turning left from Simon
Way on to Vineyard Avenue at about 8:45 a.m., according to police
reports. Witnesses told officers that Ayala had failed to stop at a
red light, Reed said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Ventura agreed this week to extend salary and benefits to
city employees on active duty with the U.S. military.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to authorize benefits for another six months was made
by the City Council on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   The city will pay the difference between what an employee receives
in military pay and what he or she makes as a city worker. Currently,
only one city employee--a Ventura police officer--will receive the
benefit.</LD>
<TE>   The council agreed to the provision six months ago and decided to
extend the benefit after learning the employee will remain on active
duty for another six months.</TE>
<TE>   The total cost to Ventura will be about $17,000, said Linda
Kegerreis, the city's director of human resources.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 70-unit apartment building offering affordable housing is closer to
reality after the City Council this week gave preliminary approval
for a $1.4-million loan to the developer, Cabrillo Economic
Development Corp. of Saticoy.</LD>
<LD>   The $12.7-million Plaza del Sol would be built at Alamo Street and
Fairbanks Avenue. Cabrillo, the county's largest private developer of
low-income housing, must arrange the remaining financing, which would
come from the California Housing Agency, federal housing programs and
private sources in exchange for tax credits.</LD>
<LD>   "Simi Valley needs affordable, good-quality rental housing,"
Rodney Fernandez, Cabrillo's executive director, said Tuesday.
"'Affordable' is for people making up to $42,000 a year."</LD>
<TE>   Cabrillo would set aside 34 of the one- to four-bedroom apartments
for households making no more than 60% of the median income for
Ventura County families. Rents on those units would range from $683
for one bedroom up to $1,148 for a four-bedroom unit. The rent on the
other apartments would average $1,200 for a two-bedroom unit.</TE>

<HD>Andersen CEO Quits in Effort to Help Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executive of accounting firm Andersen, which is under
federal indictment and losing major clients daily, announced his
resignation Tuesday in a bid to help save the firm from collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph F. Berardino's decision left unanswered who would take over the
firm and how his departure would affect the Justice Department's
prosecution of Andersen on obstruction of justice charges.</LD>
<LD>   "While my nature is to keep fighting to protect our people and our
clients, the fact is that the improper shredding of documents took place
on my watch--and I believe it is now in the best interests of the firm
for me to step down from the CEO position," Berardino, 52, who also is
Andersen's worldwide managing partner, said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen is rapidly losing business and is seeing its overseas
affiliates splinter under the weight of the criminal indictment for
destroying documents sought in the federal probe of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino's resignation came four days after former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul A. Volcker offered to take control of Andersen in return
for new management and an agreement by the Justice Department to dismiss
or suspend its prosecution of the firm, among other conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials would not comment Tuesday on the
resignation or whether it would have any effect on the department's
consideration of Volcker's rescue plan.</TE>
<TE>   "In any criminal matter, there are certain conditions and requirements
that would have to be met before there were any sort of
resolution--meaningful reforms, cooperation and full acceptance of
responsibility," Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said. "That's
been our position from the start, and that hasn't changed."</TE>
<TE>   But Berardino's resignation may represent the first step toward
Volcker assuming control of Andersen, said Allan Koltin, head of
accounting industry consulting firm PDI in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "[Volcker] said, 'We're taking over and putting new leadership in.'
That meant the current CEO was going to be gone," Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   Koltin predicted that Andersen partners would vote grudgingly in the
next few days to accede to Volcker's plan. Though many partners dislike
Volcker's proposal because it would slash their incomes, Koltin said,
there also is a growing consensus that they have no choice.</TE>
<TE>   Early this week, Andersen sent an e-mail survey to partners, querying
them about their feelings toward Volcker's proposal and the possible
elimination of a clause that prohibits partners from taking their
business to other firms. The questionnaire also seeks demographic data,
such as length of service and practice area.</TE>
<TE>   Disorganization has hampered efforts to save the firm, said Volcker,
who wants to transform it into a model accounting firm focused on the
auditing and tax work that once represented the industry's bread and
butter.</TE>
<TE>   "This has become a cumbersome partnership to say the least," Volcker
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Berardino was aware that people were asking who takes
responsibility for all that has happened and he decided he would be the
person to do that," said Volcker, who was named by Andersen in February
to head an independent panel charged with restructuring the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was dissension about him, he has now moved on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the inner workings of Andersen report an
atmosphere of frustration and disarray, with factions pursuing different
and sometimes competing agendas. Moreover, the firm's retired partners
are concerned that Andersen's demise and its huge liabilities would
threaten their pensions.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been opinions voiced that it was getting to be time for
him to step down," said Nathan Matthews, an audit manager in Andersen's
Woodland Hills office.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you quite honestly there's been a leadership vacuum--and
that's before he resigned. It is difficult, internally, to know who's in
charge."</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of Volcker step ping in to run the accounting giant,
Matthews said, "is the best solution for us now."</TE>
<TE>   Berardino notified employees of his resignation Tuesday afternoon. He
will continue to lead Andersen until the firm's board of partners chooses
an interim successor.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman said a permanent CEO may not be named because of
negotiations to merge the overseas partnerships with accounting firm KPMG
and because some of the foreign offices are arranging combinations with
other rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gorrell, a veteran partner who runs Andersen's domestic
operations from its Chicago headquarters, is expected to take a prominent
role in the interim, people within the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably a bit more in touch with" the feelings of the U.S.
partners, accounting consultant Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker's proposal was conditioned on persuading Justice Department
officials to dismiss or suspend a criminal indictment of the firm.
Volcker said the plan also would require the approval of a "significant
number" of Andersen partners and the agreement of attorneys involved in
class-action lawsuits against the accounting firm to cap its liability at
a "realistic" level that recognized its daily bleeding of clients and
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   As of Tuesday, the Volcker plan had gathered plaudits but no concrete
action had been taken by the interested parties.</TE>
<TE>   One Andersen insider said the U.S. management team was working to
figure out "the best direction for the firm" but that was taking time.</TE>
<TE>   Without setting a specific deadline, Volcker said the firm has only
days to signal its intention. "You can't rescue people if they don't want
to be rescued," he said. "It is difficult getting all these people
together, and I have no idea what the Justice Department is thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Koltin noted that the partners may attach certain conditions to their
acceptance, such as being allowed to keep some of their more lucrative
consulting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker, who praised Berardino for his commitment to reform in the
accounting industry, also said he hoped the resignation might shake the
various parties into action.</TE>
<TE>   The firm served as both the auditor and a major consultant for energy
trader Enron, which overstated profits and hid billions of dollars of
debt from investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of the Houston-based firm was the
largest in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen denies criminal wrongdoing and is scheduled to go to trial on
the obstruction charge May 6.</TE>
<TE>   In another blow to Andersen's image, a Securities and Exchange
Commission suit filed Tuesday against former officers of Waste Management
Inc. detailed how the auditing firm allegedly conspired with Waste
Management executives in the mid-1990s to hide fraudulent accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said Andersen identified improper accounting practices at
Waste Management, but covered them up by secretly agreeing to allow the
firm to fix the "errors" in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about 60 major clients since December. The
defections have cost the firm at least 10% of its annual U.S. revenue .
Additionally, Andersen's foreign affiliates are negotiating mergers with
its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino joined Andersen in 1972 and has served as its chief
executive since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Walter Hamilton and Jeff Leeds in Los Angeles and
Eric Lichtblau in Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday nominated an Arizona doctor with an
action-hero resume to be surgeon general, traditionally the nation's most
prominent platform for addressing the public on health issues.</LD>
<LD>   Named to the post was Richard Carmona, a 52-year-old Arizona trauma
surgeon, part-time lawman and former Green Beret who killed a man 30
months ago in a shootout at a Tucson intersection.</LD>
<LD>   In that incident, Carmona was caught in a gun battle after stopping to
aid in what he thought was a traffic accident. In fact, he had stumbled
onto a killer who was holding a woman hostage.</LD>
<TE>   The man, who police later determined had stabbed his father to death
and was on his way to kill an old girlfriend, grazed Carmona's head with
a bullet before the doctor, also a badge-carrying sheriff's deputy, fired
a single shot to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses reported that Carmona had urged the man to put down his
weapon. After Carmona shot him, he tried to save his life.</TE>
<TE>   It was only one in a series of tension-filled moments in the life of a
self-described "high school dropout, poor Hispanic kid" who has risen to
prominence from a hard-luck childhood in New York City's Spanish Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he helped save a man stranded on a cliff in a daring
helicopter rescue that later became the basis of a made-for-television
movie.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first learned that Dr. Richard Carmona once dangled out of a
moving helicopter, I worried that maybe he wasn't the best guy to educate
our Americans about reducing health risks," Bush joked Tuesday at the
White House ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   But "that turned out to be just one of several times that Dr. Carmona
risked his own life to save others," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   At the ceremony, Bush also announced his appointment of Elias
Zerhouni, a Johns Hopkins University administrator and radiologist, to
head the National Institutes of Health. Both men must be confirmed by the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he has asked Carmona to focus on several public health
initiatives as surgeon general, ranging from prevention of disease
through healthier living to reducing alcohol and drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But it may have been Carmona's experience in dealing with bioterrorism
preparedness issues that made his candidacy rise above other names that
had been mentioned, including Bush's personal physician, Kenneth Cooper
of Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Carmona has worked for many years in law enforcement and
community preparedness, important preparation for any emergency that may
come," Bush said. "Dr. Carmona is an experienced voice to help educate
Americans about the best precautions and response to the threat of
bioterrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The prominence of the surgeon general, whose office oversees 5,600
commissioned public health officers, has been largely driven by the
personality of the individual in the job. The post's clout also has
depended on the surgeon general's relationship with the president who
made the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   C. Everett Koop went from a pediatric surgeon in Philadelphia--whose
nomination by President Reagan was widely derided--to a household name
and powerful voice for sex education and against smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Just-departed surgeon general David Satcher had an influential role
under President Clinton, who appointed him to a four-year term that began
in February 1998. But Satcher was widely seen as ineffectual under the
Bush administration, and critics noted his virtual absence during the
public health response to the terrorist and anthrax attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona called his nomination as the nation's top public health
spokesman an "American dream."</TE>
<TE>   He grew up poor, born to alcoholic parents. By the 10th grade he was a
problem student who had dropped out of school. Many of his childhood
friends, he has said, turned to crime.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona chose to enlist in the Army. He served as a medic in Vietnam,
where he received a Bronze Star, the Purple Heart and Combat Medical
Badge. He later became a weapon specialist with the Green Berets.</TE>
<TE>   He came home to earn a high school equivalency degree and became the
first in his family to go to college. He earned a bachelor's degree and
medical degree from UC San Francisco, graduating at the top of his class.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, speaking briefly during the ceremony in the East Room of
the White House, Carmona alternated between Spanish and English. In a
voice that cracked with emotion, he thanked the president for his
appointment. "To where I am today, it was just nothing you could even
dream about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers scrambled to learn more about Carmona's
views on a range of issues.</TE>
<TE>   If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the second Latino to serve as
surgeon general. The first, Antonia Novello, a pediatric AIDS specialist
who grew up in Puerto Rico, served under Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who chairs the Health, Education and
Labor Committee, said he would promptly call hearings on the nominations
of both Carmona and Zerhouni.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona's relative obscurity was reflected in Kennedy's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy called Zerhouni, whose name had been leaked earlier this month
by White House aides, a "distinguished scientist with an impressive
career as a scientific administrator."</TE>
<TE>   Of Carmona, Kennedy said only: "I look forward to learning more about
Dr. Carmona's record."</TE>
<TE>   In the desert city where Carmona has lived for 17 years, his
nomination to the nation's top health-care job only added to his
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   He is known as a tireless worker, one of the most prominent and
recognized people in Tucson. He and his wife, Diana, have four children,
three of whom are adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona is a clinical professor at the University of Arizona and
chairman and medical director of the Southern Arizona Medical System
Council, a group that helps make decisions about emergency care and
resources in five counties. He is also a longtime member of the Pima
County Sheriff's Department SWAT team.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll bring a dimension to [the surgeon general's] office that's
unprecedented," said Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, who first met
Carmona in 1985. "He understands law enforcement, hazardous materials,
bioterrorism. It's an asset they need."</TE>
<TE>   His career in Tucson, however, has not been without setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona was fired as director of the trauma center at Tucson Medical
Center in 1993. In a wrongful discharge lawsuit, he argued that he was
being punished for complaining about the hospital's "illegal and
unethical practices," reportedly winning $3.9 million in a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Shropshire, former chief executive of the center, told the
Arizona Daily Star: "From a management standpoint, we had some
difficulties. He could be difficult. But from the standpoint of
dedication to his patients, I judge him very well."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he was forced to resign by local officials as head of the Pima
County health care system, which was plagued by debt.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such problems, he is best known in Tucson for his heroism.</TE>
<TE>   In the helicopter drama, which was captured on film, Carmona was
dropped on to a narrow ledge where another helicopter had crashed. Two of
the three people on board were dead, but one, Glenn Velardi, was waving
his arm near the wrecked chopper. Using a makeshift harness, Carmona
strapped himself and Velardi to the hovering rescue helicopter, which
then flew them to safety.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had been in charge I would not have allowed it," Dupnik said.
"It was just too dangerous. But he just jumped into the helicopter and
said 'Let's go get them.' "</TE>
<TE>   The shootout occurred as Carmona was on his way to serve as the
on-call medic at a University of Arizona football game. For his actions
in that incident, he was named one of the nation's Top Cops, an award
sponsored by the National Assn. of Police Organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Sgt. Don Kester, who heads the Pima County SWAT team,
characterized Carmona as a "father figure" because he has been with the
Sheriff's Department for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't find anyone who will put more hours in a project," Kester
said. "He just works the whole time. He's a driven individual, but one of
the more humble people we know.'</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, a registered independent, donated $500 in 1999 to Bush's
presidential campaign, according to federal records. He had been
contemplating a run for Congress from his heavily Democratic House
district when the administration approached him about the surgeon
general's job, he recently told the Daily Star, but he had not decided
which party he would file to represent.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Won't Go to Summit, Blames Sharon</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian leader rejects conditions set by Israeli prime
minister, who might not have let him return. Move could derail peace
talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Yasser Arafat announced Tuesday that he would not attend a key Arab
summit, after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ignored U.S. pleas and
set severe conditions on the Palestinian Authority president's travel.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat's absence is a blow to the Arab League gathering, which starts
today in Beirut and will discuss a potentially far-reaching
Saudi-sponsored Middle East peace initiative. In addition, Palestinian
anger over Sharon's restrictions on Arafat could derail U.S.-mediated
talks here aimed at securing a cease-fire in vicious Israeli-Palestinian
fighting that has killed about 1,500 people in 18 months.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon, appearing on Israeli television's Arabic-language service,
said the "conditions are not yet ripe" to lift Israel's travel ban on
Arafat. The prime minister said he might agree to release Arafat if he
could then veto the Palestinian leader's return home in the event of a
new attack on Israelis--and if Washington signed off on his de facto
banishment.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said such conditions amounted to blackmail and
were a "dangerous provocation." Arafat issued a statement saying he had
decided to remain with his "steadfast people" and deny Israel the chance
to prevent his return to the West Bank. He has been trapped by Israeli
forces in his Ramallah headquarters since December.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the leader of one of only two Arab
countries to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, also bowed out of
the summit Tuesday, citing "domestic commitments."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher rejected
Sharon's new conditions, saying Israel had to issue a "round trip" for
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon made the decision despite calls late Monday from Vice President
Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell urging him to let
Arafat travel to the summit. Even after Sharon's announcement, U.S.
Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer went to see him to try again to convince him
to let Arafat go.</TE>
<TE>   "The message has been very strong. Sharon understands the gravity and
the importance we attach to his decision," a State Department official
said in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's denouement ended a weeklong test of wills between Sharon and
Arafat over whether the former would allow the latter to travel and who
would gain the most from the confrontation. Even before Tuesday's
decisions, however, there was a growing consensus that Arafat's goals
might be better served by sitting out the Beirut meeting rather than
accepting what Palestinians saw as humiliating Israeli prerequisites.</TE>
<TE>   It is a matter of unmistakable irony that these two longtime
arch-nemeses are engaged again in a showdown involving Beirut. Two
decades ago, Sharon launched Israel's invasion of Lebanon, marching all
the way to Beirut in a bloody bid to dislodge Arafat, whose Palestine
Liberation Organization was staging cross-border attacks on Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The animosity was on display Tuesday in interviews that Sharon gave to
Israeli newspapers. He said he regretted promising the United States that
he wouldn't harm the Palestinian leader and now realizes that he should
have enlisted U.S. help in expelling him.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the top-selling Israeli daily, Yediot Aharonot,
Sharon said President Bush had repeatedly demanded that he agree not to
harm or expel Arafat, and Sharon had relented. That commitment, Sharon
said, was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "My consent may have been correct at first," he said. "But from a
certain stage in the conflict, it was a mistake. I should have told them
[the Americans], 'I can't keep that commitment.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's remorse over sparing Arafat echoed a statement he made in a
newspaper interview earlier this year. He said then that he regretted not
killing Arafat when he had a chance--during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The volatility of this moment in the region's tortured history was
evident Tuesday morning when two Palestinians blew themselves up in a car
en route to Jerusalem's huge Malka shopping mall. Israeli authorities
said the men, reported to be members of a militia linked to Arafat's
Fatah movement, may have been planning to attack the mall but were
intercepted by police. The bomb they were carrying detonated a short
distance from the police, killing the pair.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Israeli security official said Israel had learned of the
planned attack two days ago and relayed the information to the
Palestinian Authority. But Palestinian security forces failed to take
action to stop the potentially disastrous attack, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, in his television appearance Tuesday night, demanded that
Arafat meet additional terms in order to travel. Arafat must declare a
cease-fire and show that he is serious about it by announcing it in
Arabic to the Palestinian people, Sharon said. Arafat did this in
December, and violence dropped off for a while.</TE>
<TE>   But the prospects of a cease-fire remained elusive Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni continued with another round of
teeth-pulling negotiations with security officials from the two sides. He
met for hours with the Palestinian delegation, with no results announced,
and heard from the Israelis that they would accept Zinni's latest
compromise proposal "with reservations."</TE>
<TE>   No breakthrough appeared imminent. "It's tough slogging," a U.S.
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side is talking formally about the differences that continue
to forestall agreement. But generally, the Palestinians want to move into
discussions of political concessions within two weeks, while Israel wants
to put that off for at least a month.</TE>
<TE>   And the Palestinians continue to balk at Israel's demand that the
Palestinian Authority arrest militants.</TE>
<TE>   "When you shell, blockade and close us down, there is nothing we can
do," the Palestinian security chief for the West Bank, Col. Jibril
Rajoub, told Israeli radio. "When you bomb our jails, no one remains
there. There are no longer any police stations or police commands in the
majority of the West Bank and Gaza Strip cities."</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub also warned of unimaginable violence if Arafat isn't allowed to
leave Ramallah. Thousands of Palestinians marched through Gaza City on
Tuesday to protest Sharon's demands on Arafat and insist their leader not
relent.</TE>
<TE>   But Arafat could actually gain politically by skipping the summit in
Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Not going focuses the spotlight on Arafat--cast as a martyr and hero
at home for resisting Sharon's terms--and on Israel's defiance of the
international community. If Sharon bowed to U.S. pressure and agreed to
let Arafat leave, the prime minister would lose face among his hard-line
constituency. And he would risk Arafat's use of the Beirut venue as a
platform for Israel-bashing. Either way, in the view of analysts here,
Arafat wins, Sharon loses.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief for the Gaza Strip,
said he and other aides advised Arafat not to travel to Beirut after
receiving clear signals that Sharon was seriously considering blocking
the Palestinian leader's return.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners in Sharon's government insist that ridding the land of
Arafat and keeping up military pressure on the Palestinian Authority are
the only ways to stop the Palestinian uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Late into Tuesday, the Bush administration said it didn't accept the
statements by the Middle East leaders as final.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not have seen the final act to this play. It's not at all
clear that final decisions . . . have been made," a senior Bush
administration official said Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Robin Wright in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Gay Syphilis Surge Fans HIV Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outbreaks of syphilis among gay men in large urban areas,
particularly in California, are threatening to reverse progress toward
eliminating the disease in this country.</LD>
<LD>   In San Francisco, the number of new infectious cases grew from a
historic low of 26 in 1998 to 139 last year. Officials there say the
total could easily top 250 this year--which would be the highest in more
than a decade.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco health officials are so concerned that last week they
mandated a sweeping set of new requirements on sex clubs and adult
bookstores, which include handing out condoms and lubricant to every
patron.</LD>
<TE>   Other major cities also are seeing increases in syphilis. New York
City reported 282 cases last year, the most since 1995. Los Angeles
County logged 187 cases in 2001, up from a low of 88 in 1999. And
Miami-Dade County reported 186 cases last year, six times higher than its
1998 low.</TE>
<TE>   The cases in these and many other urban areas disproportionately
involve gay or bisexual men--61% in Los Angeles, for example, and 82% in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Though syphilis is treatable with antibiotics, health officials are
worried because its sores greatly facilitate the spread of HIV. The
outbreaks signal a breakdown in safe-sex practices and often presage a
rise in HIV.</TE>
<TE>   In both San Francisco and Los Angeles County, more than half of those
testing positive for syphilis are also HIV-positive.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the effort to eliminate syphilis from the United
States--launched by the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in 1998--has mostly targeted impoverished minority
communities. But the recent rise in infections among gay and bisexual men
is undermining the overall elimination goal and is forcing health
officials to revamp their strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the national effort to achieve the syphilis elimination goal
may not be possible because of the extent to which syphilis has so
thoroughly moved into the [gay and bisexual] community," said Dr. Peter
Kerndt, chief of sexually transmitted disease control for the Los Angeles
County Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as November, federal health officials said they saw
near-elimination of syphilis as a realistic goal. That was because the
rise in syphilis among gay men was overshadowed by declines in the
heterosexual population.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, primary and secondary syphilis cases--which are the early,
infectious stages--fell 9.6% in 2000, the CDC reported in November. The
national tally takes time to compile and does not reflect the more recent
surges among gay men.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC has spent more than a year debating what to say in a report on
the increases. Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, a senior STD prevention official,
said the agency is still trying to figure out the best approach to take
toward high-risk members of the gay community.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get that out," Valdiserri said of the report. "It's going
to be given a very high priority."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials have struggled at times to switch gears, as well.</TE>
<TE>   After an outbreak among gay men in Los Angeles County was reported in
March 2000, Kerndt asked county supervisors for money for a prevention
campaign and to hire screening teams to work in bathhouses and the County
Jail. Supervisors provided money for a two-month media campaign, but not
the outreach teams.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, some public health officials acknowledge they don't know
how to respond to the outbreaks. While the CDC has been targeting
communities with poor access to health care and information, the issues
in the gay and bisexual communities appear to be entirely different. Many
of those at risk seem to know the consequences of unsafe sex but practice
it anyway, health experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what message to put out there to get their attention,
to get them to change their behavior," said Tom Burns, acting STD program
manager at the Miami-Dade County Health Department. "We just see
continuous unsafe practices, such as multiple partners and anonymous
sex."</TE>
<TE>   Research suggests that a growing segment of gay men are tired of
safe-sex messages or believe AIDS drugs can keep the virus at bay
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, San Francisco's STD control chief, said some men
see unprotected sex as an issue of personal freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, there seems to be acceptance that some level [of syphilis]
is tolerable in exchange for the right of individuals to have sex where
and when they want it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, although the surge in syphilis cases has not led to
safer sex practices, it appears to have prompted more widespread syphilis
testing. Walk-in testing at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center has
doubled in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Primary syphilis causes a painless sore, and secondary syphilis often
creates a rash. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to cardiovascular
and neurological diseases, blindness and even death. It can cause
stillbirths for infected women.</TE>
<TE>   As CDC officials debate their syphilis strategy, San Francisco
officials say they can't wait to contain its spread. Among their actions:</TE>
<TE>   * In a letter this month, they asked physicians to test all sexually
active gay men for syphilis twice a year and to test anyone with a
rash-like syndrome, which could be secondary syphilis.</TE>
<TE>   * Sex clubs and adult bookstores were ordered to enforce the "no
unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse" policy, in addition to handing
out condoms and lubricant at the door. All club and bookstore staff must
also attend a city-run training session on safe sex.</TE>
<TE>   * The health department has redirected staff members from other STD
programs to syphilis investigation and education. It has also asked the
CDC to provide more money.</TE>
<TE>   * They will launch a campaign next month called "Spring Cleaning,"
encouraging STD testing.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS prevention agencies in San Francisco are mobilizing as well. Stop
AIDS, based in the largely gay Castro district, has begun distributing
2,000 condoms a month to sex clubs and adult bookstores. But the group's
leaders wonder whether their approach will work.</TE>
<TE>   "Syphilis can be cured," said Steve Gibson, program director for Stop
AIDS. But "it doesn't have the same sense of immediacy" as HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Buzz Bense, owner of Eros Sex Club in San Francisco, said his club
already offers condoms within arm's reach and posts signs warning patrons
about the risk of syphilis infection.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have concerns that a sort of hysteria is going to grow out of
this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it does not make sense that these men who are practicing
high-risk sex would limit it to the clubs," Bense said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to be having the exact same activities in their
bedrooms, in bathrooms, parks, wherever.</TE>
<TE>   "The dilemma for prevention people is how do we affect these people's
behavior? No one has a clue."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Although the empty seat belonging to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat will be the center of attention at an Arab League
summit that opens here today, the absence of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak will be even more keenly felt.</LD>
<LD>   It had been widely expected that Israeli conditions would block
Arafat's attendance, but Mubarak's eleventh-hour decision Tuesday to bow
out was a stunning development--and dealt a serious blow to a
Saudi-backed Middle East peace proposal.</LD>
<LD>   Mubarak's abrupt withdrawal from the summit undermined what had been a
growing sense of unity among leaders here, who had appeared on the
threshold of setting aside individual agendas in order to inject a
political dialogue back into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the summit will be marked by notable no-shows: Half the seats
reserved for 21 heads of state plus Arafat will be occupied by
underlings. In addition to Egypt and the Palestinians, Libya, Iraq, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Sudan and
Mauritania are all slated to be represented at a lower level, although in
some cases--including Saudi Arabia--that is because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   In an added blow, a senior Jordanian government official said today
that King Abdullah II also will not attend. He will be represented by
Jordan's prime minister, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The failure of the Arab leadership to gather in its entirety at the
summit serves as a reminder of one uncomfortable reality that the Arab
League has struggled to overcome since it was founded in 1945: There is
no "Arab world" to speak of, not in political terms. Myriad economic,
social, political and religious forces are constantly pulling at the
seams of Arab unity.</TE>
<TE>   "Outside of our cultural identity, you have some strategic ties, but
it is not a love affair," said Abdel Moneim Said, director of the Al
Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, a government-sponsored
think tank in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has galvanized the Arab world,
and the Saudi peace plan had sparked a degree of optimism in a region
weary of bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   As the leader of the Arab world's most populous nation, one of only
two Arab countries--along with Jordan--to have signed a peace treaty with
Israel, Mubarak's presence at the summit was considered essential if the
Saudi plan was to have credibility.</TE>
<TE>   After denying earlier reports that he would skip the summit, Mubarak
dispatched his foreign minister late Tuesday to announce that he wasn't
coming because of "domestic commitments"--a euphemism that was widely
viewed as thin cover.</TE>
<TE>   Officials close to the negotiations over the Saudi plan said it
appeared that Egypt was jealous that Saudi Arabia had stolen its
spotlight with the peace initiative. Egypt's peace proposals have gone
nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab heads of state who gather today are still expected to endorse
the Saudi proposal. Although it is vague, just four or five lines
promising "normal relations" if Israel withdraws from lands occupied
since 1967, many Arab leaders looked to the initiative as a step toward
peace, and repairing an image badly damaged Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But the barriers to unity are high. Morocco and Algeria are locked in
a bitter border dispute involving the Western Sahara. Libya and Tunisia
are also bickering over borders. Libya and Lebanon are at odds over the
disappearance more than 20 years ago of a prominent Shiite religious
leader in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. Tensions exist even between Syria
and Lebanon, its satellite state, over border and sovereignty issues.
Eleven years after the end of the Persian Gulf War, Iraq and Kuwait are
still at loggerheads over sovereignty and prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   The issues run the gamut from political to cultural, concrete to
emotional. The divisions are so profound, and so dispiriting to those who
have pan-Arab aspirations, that the run-up to the Arab summit has been
preceded by a lot of angst and hand-wringing.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of ushering in the 21st century strong and united, we Arabs
started off the second millennium weak and defeated," read an opinion
piece that recently appeared in the Egyptian daily newspaper Al Ahram.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi daily Al Watan recently ran an opinion piece that said:
"Impotence and the dearth of any meaningful achievements in all fields
are pushing the Arab world ever deeper into crisis. The future appears
very bleak indeed, full of dangers for the vast majority of Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   But it appeared that support for the Palestinians and opposition to a
U.S. military strike against Iraq were issues that could unite the Arab
community in a way that had previously eluded it. Amr Moussa, the
charismatic leader of the Arab League, who took over nearly a year ago
with the goal of energizing the moribund organization, had hoped to
exploit those feelings.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah first revealed the
outlines of his peace proposal, many Arab leaders reacted cautiously.
Syria, in particular, had raised the prospect that President Bashar Assad
wouldn't attend the summit. Yemen withheld its comment. Libya offered its
own proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was, the peace plan was too straightforward: If Israel
withdrew to its pre-1967 borders, it suggested, all Arab nations would
offer full social, political, economic and cultural relations with the
Jewish state. The proposal didn't specifically address the issue of East
Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state or the more problematic
issue of the so-called right of return for the 4 million or so
Palestinian refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposal looks like it unites all the Arabs together and opens a
path for the United States to solve the problems," said Talal Salman,
publisher of the Lebanese newspaper As Safir. "But any proposal that does
not include the right of return is not complete. It does not address the
core issue."</TE>
<TE>   But Moussa and Saudi Arabia's Abdullah persuaded the Arab leadership
to go along with the plan. The draft statement to be presented to the
leadership at the summit did have some changes but stayed close to the
initially vague proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of normalization with Israel, which some objected to, the
phrase "normal relations" was used. On the right of return, which Israel
has rejected as threatening to its existence, the Arab League called for
a "just solution"--meaning one that allowed for either returning or for
receiving compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Even the issue of Arafat's ability to travel to the summit had
appeared to unite those present. Although members of his delegation had
hoped that he would attend, if for no other reason than to show defiance
of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, there was a broad feeling here
that the whole controversy had made Arafat's presence felt whether he was
physically here or not.</TE>
<TE>   In the conflict over Iraq, there also had appeared to be progress.
Although it was unlikely that a deal would have been sealed by the end of
the summit, talks between Iraq and Kuwait were by all accounts cordial
and moving forward. Kuwait and Iraq for the first time had committed
themselves in writing to a recognition of each other's sovereignty--but
the talks broke down when Kuwait asked for an added sentence that had
Iraq promising never again to invade.</TE>
<TE>   The summit leadership appeared poised to pass a resolution that
opposed any aggression against Iraq, not necessarily naming the United
States but making it clear who it meant.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi initiative and the statement opposing an Iraqi invasion will
still be voted on, and will still carry the label of pan-Arab proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is very clear," Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said.
"Egypt supports the [peace] proposal, and the Egyptian delegation
received instructions from the president regarding that support."</TE>
<TE>   But with so many heads of state absent, and Mubarak sending his proxy
vote, observers said that they can only hope that the summit's decisions
will be taken seriously.</TE>

<HD>The U.S. Bomb That Nearly Killed Karzai</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Target finder's error cost about 28 lives in 'friendly
fire.'</DH>
<SE>ABOUT THIS SERIES: This is one in an occasional series chronicling
untold stories from the war in Afghanistan. Reynolds was recently on
assignment in Showali Kowt and Kandahar. Hendren reported from Kandahar;
Fort Walton Beach, Fla.; Ft. Campbell; and Washington. Times staff writer
Bob Drogin in Washington contributed to this report.</SE>

<DL>SHOWALI KOWT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The blast rocked the hilltop, scattering American and Afghan dead
and wounded in a morning haze of blood and smoke. Some of the men thought
the ground beneath them had been raked by Taliban mortar fire.</LD>
<LD>   Yet only one thing in the Afghanistan war could convulse the earth
with such force.</LD>
<LD>   "As I was flying in the air, I knew," Green Beret Capt. Jason Amerine
recalled. "We were hit by our own bomb."</LD>
<TE>   One of the most celebrated bombs in the U.S. arsenal, a
satellite-guided 2,000-pound explosive, had detonated on a huddle of
Green Berets and allied Afghans. The "friendly fire" incident became one
of the most publicized in the Afghan war and almost killed the man the
Green Berets were assigned to protect: Hamid Karzai, who later that day
was named the country's interim prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
that a U.S. target finder on the ground mistakenly gave his own
coordinates to a B-52 bomber pilot overhead. The bomb plunged unerringly
along its deadly trajectory.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military is still studying the Dec. 5 event. But interviews
with local Afghan officials and U.S. military sources strongly suggest
that the number of casualties was far greater than the Pentagon disclosed
at the time. The explosion killed three Green Berets and about 25 of
their Afghan allies, four times as many Afghans as initially reported.
Local fighters counted nearly 80 casualties. Even today, questions linger
about the total number of dead and wounded. Afghan fighters insist that
some Americans were unaccounted for the next day and that a CIA agent
might have been killed. CIA officials deny the report.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the bomb's crater remains in the dirt and rock, about 6 feet in
diameter and 3 feet deep, on the crest of the hill where the Americans
and Afghans had been meeting, as the battle waned, to plan their next
mission.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the blood of the Americans," Dr. Syed Mir Ahmad Shah, the
manager of a nearby clinic, said recently as he climbed the barren hill
where the massive bomb struck. He pointed out dark patches among the
rocks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's another one. That's another one."</TE>
<TE>Battle at Village Commenced Dec. 3</TE>
<TE>   The battle of Showali Kowt began Dec. 3. The northern two-thirds of
the country had already been wrested from Taliban control, and Amerine
and the 11 other men in his team were escorting Karzai and his band of
fighters southward.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai was eager to take Showali Kowt, 10 miles from the Taliban's
final stronghold of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of firefights, the coalition forces seized the village,
sending the Taliban fleeing south across a bridge over a small river.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban retook the village in a raid that night. But the Americans
marked the enemy's location with infrared pointers, visible only to an
AC-130 gunship pilot in night-vision goggles overhead. The aircraft's
105-millimeter cannons and artillery fire strafed the ground, driving the
Taliban back across the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 4, the coalition decided to take the bridge to isolate the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   As Amerine moved toward it with about 60 men, a second contingent gave
covering fire. A hundred yards short of a hilltop Taliban observation
post, Amerine's men took machine gun fire from Taliban troops entrenched
in orchards near the riverbank.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pinned down pretty well," Amerine recalled last week in an
interview at the 5th Special Forces Group headquarters in Ft. Campbell,
Ky. "You poke your head up, get down and dirt would kick up around you."</TE>
<TE>   When fire raked the trench line that protected them, one Green Beret
stood and raised a finger in a universal rebuke, drawing laughs from his
Afghan allies. Then he declared, "Let's go," and led a charge that
captured the observation post.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Taliban began to retreat in four-wheel-drive trucks. The
Americans called in airstrikes that destroyed about 25 vehicles. The
coalition forces inflicted dozens of casualties, while taking almost
none.</TE>
<TE>   As the fighting waned that night, the atmosphere among the Americans
in Showali Kowt grew festive. They had fought for 48 hours with little
food and no sleep, but now a second 12-member team of Green Berets had
arrived, and a supply drop had brought care packages.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans had made the clinic their headquarters. "It really was
kind of like Christmas," Amerine said. "So everybody was reading letters,
sharing food with one another. Sharing it with the [Afghans]."</TE>
<TE>   They congratulated Karzai on the advance word that he would be the
nation's new interim leader, a decision that would be announced in
Germany the next day. Taliban surrender overtures had begun in Kandahar.
It meant that Karzai would be headed for Kabul, the Afghan capital, and
with the Taliban's demise apparent, the Americans' mission was all but
over. They got their first night's sleep in three days.</TE>
<TE>   By morning, the number of Americans at the clinic had reached about
45, recalled Shah, the village doctor. Others say the number was smaller.
Local Afghans and U.S. military sources said the American contingent
included CIA operatives.</TE>
<TE>   With Taliban still huddled in ridges across the river, a commander in
the second team of Green Berets called for airstrikes to wipe out the
enemy. One of two Air Force TAC-Ps, tactical air control parties whose
training puts them a level below more seasoned combat controllers,
calculated the distance to the enemy. He radioed in the coordinates.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials would later conclude that he relayed the wrong
numbers--giving his own position instead of the enemy's. The airman
failed to reenter the target's coordinates after changing the batteries
on his global positioning system unit. After a battery change, the unit
automatically displays its own location.</TE>
<TE>   About 9:30 a.m. came the rumble of a Vietnam-era B-52.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, a group of soldiers who belonged to Karzai's Pushtun
ethnic group were gathered about 100 feet from the clinic. With them was
Amerine's No. 2, Master Sgt. Jefferson Donald Davis, 39, an unflappable
Tennessean who two weeks earlier had helped snatch four pickups from wary
Afghan fighters and headed his men toward a fight with the Taliban,
yelling, "Ride 'em like you stole 'em!"</TE>
<TE>   He was joined by Sgt. 1st Class Daniel Henry Petithory, 32, of
Massachusetts, whose childhood friends knew him as "Ninja Dan." Standing
nearby was Staff Sgt. Brian Cody Prosser, 28, of Frazier Park, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Amerine sat cross-legged about 50 feet away, talking to a staff
officer. Karzai sat next door to the clinic in a four-room schoolhouse,
meeting with advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The satellite-guided explosive landed directly at the feet of the
Pushtun fighters. Davis and Petithory were killed instantly, along with
about 25 Afghans. Prosser died of his wounds later that day.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion knocked Amerine into the air and blew out both his
eardrums, and a bolt of shrapnel tore into his leg. Rock and shrapnel
shot through the clinic, where a bloodstained doorjamb records the spot
where another Green Beret was standing, the doctor said. In the
schoolhouse, Karzai was bloodied by flying glass that penetrated his face
and head, said the doctor, who bandaged the wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "A bunch of us had to keep everybody calm and say, 'Deal with the
casualties. We're not under attack,' " Amerine said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who could walk helped the medics tend to the wounded. Open
chest wounds had to be packed, limbs amputated, arteries clamped, burns
wrapped. One medic rushed from one patient to the next, ignoring a
serious wound to his own head. Their work saved the lives of at least
five Americans and numerous Afghans, Amerine said.</TE>
<TE>   Recalled Shah, the local doctor: "We collected some body parts, but
they could not be identified. Sometimes we could only find a head or a
hand."</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force target finder survived. There is no record of him being
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   At its base in Pakistan, three hours away by helicopter, a team of Air
Force rescue specialists was alerted by urgent radio calls.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was a 32-year-old helicopter captain named Steve who had
led the first Air Force choppers to the World Trade Center after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He was thinking of the crumbled buildings as
he suited up.</TE>
<TE>   "It was surreal," said Steve, who like other special operations
soldiers asked that his last name be withheld. "To have those visions in
your mind and then to be part of taking action to help ensure that
America is safe from that again really gives you a sense of purpose."</TE>
<TE>   When his crew members asked for a casualty count, the response took
them by surprise: "We'll give you as many as you can take."</TE>
<TE>   Two doctors and a crew of Air Force pararescuers, or PJs, climbed into
the back of two MH-53 J/M choppers, a long-range aircraft with a history
of rescue missions. They left without knowing whether they were headed
into a secure area or into Taliban territory.</TE>
<TE>   Navy fighters escorted the choppers as they flew over Afghan airspace.
The choppers skimmed the ground at 200 to 300 feet, low enough to make
out individual Taliban soldiers on the ground without giving them time to
launch their Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The casualty numbers coming in over the radio kept rising. The extra
bodies meant extra weight. The copters wouldn't have enough fuel to make
it back. Steve's helicopter crew jettisoned equipment to save fuel.</TE>
<TE>   After they descended to Showali Kowt, the PJs were taken aback.
Rolling toward them was a convoy of at least half a dozen Toyota pickup
trucks riddled with shrapnel, their windows blown out, one with the roof
ripped off. Each carried at least two wounded men on litters.</TE>
<TE>   The PJs and survivors piled one slain Green Beret and 31 of the most
severely wounded men into Steve's helicopter. Someone had draped an
American flag over the Beret.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy must have been carrying that flag around for weeks," said
Steve, the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The second chopper loaded up with injured, and the two aircraft lifted
off for Camp Rhino, the U.S. Marine encampment near Kandahar. The PJs and
doctors worked on up to three men at a time in the severely crowded
aircraft, on a floor wet with the mingled blood of Afghan and American
fighters. The engines drowned out the noise of the PJs amputating limbs.</TE>
<TE>   In short order, both helicopters needed fuel. On the outskirts of
Taliban-held Kandahar, a KC-130 air-refueling tanker answered their call
and joined the formation.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force rules forbid midair refueling for pilots who have been on
duty more than 16 hours. Steve was in hour 23. As fuel flowed into the
chopper's nosecone, the front rotor blades missed the refueling craft by
mere feet.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopters reached Camp Rhino, deep in the war zone, more than an
hour later and then delivered the more critically wounded to another
hospital that military officials declined to name.</TE>
<TE>   When they reached the hospital, the casualties included the copters
themselves. A C-130 cargo plane had been dispatched with a team of
mechanics to get the choppers in shape for the flight back to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   As the mechanics peered into the back of Steve's chopper, it looked as
if someone had spray-painted the cargo space red.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was covered in blood--the walls, the litters, the cargo
straps, all the equipment inside," said Jan, a 38-year-old master
sergeant and maintenance supervisor. "It looked like hell in there."</TE>
<TE>   Within three hours, the mechanics repaired the hydraulics and other
problems on the aircraft and sent the crews on their way.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of lives were saved that day," said Jan, now back at his base
at Hurlburt Field, Fla. "It makes a lot of lonely times, away from the
family and everything, worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>Locals Insist That Death Toll Was Higher</TE>
<TE>   Hours afterward, Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke told reporters
that the errant bomb killed three U.S. service members and six allied
Afghan fighters, wounding an additional 20 Americans and an untold number
of Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   But local commanders and villagers, including the doctor who managed
the clinic that Americans used as their headquarters, insist that the
death toll was much higher.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Mohammed, a 25-year-old Karzai bodyguard who spent a month aboard
a U.S. aircraft carrier being treated for wounds from the attack, said he
and his comrades believe that the number of anti-Taliban Afghan dead is
closer to 25. Precise figures remain elusive because the extent of the
wounds obliterated the distinctions of nationality, and, where Afghans
are concerned, there is no official tally.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans and Afghans were mixed up, so we didn't really know who
was who," recalled Mohammed, who suffered broken arms and shrapnel wounds
to his chest, abdomen and leg. Thirty more wounded Afghans were on the
U.S. vessel with him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His estimate is confirmed by Karzai's brother, Ahmed, who is now on
the local governing council in Kandahar. Ahmed Karzai said his brother
lost 25 men.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to count because there were lots of body parts and they
loaded them so fast into the helicopter," Ahmed Karzai said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials have declined to comment on the incident, citing an
ongoing investigation. Asked about the account offered by Ahmed Karzai
and Mohammed, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, chief spokesman for the U.S.
Central Command, which is directing the war, said he had no reason to
challenge it.</TE>
<TE>   "I would simply defer to those Afghans in a position to know," Quigley
said. "We do not have good numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan fighters and villagers dispute even the official account of
American casualties. Though military casualties would be especially
difficult to hide because officials must notify families, there is
another government employer, the Central Intelligence Agency, that
reserves the right to withhold such information.</TE>
<TE>   By local accounts, there were far more Americans at Showali Kowt than
the Green Berets described by the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the discrepancy between the Pentagon figures on Americans
at the battle and those of witnesses at the scene, one military official
said the Pentagon numbers did not account for CIA officers accompanying
Karzai. Pentagon officials simply omit information on officials from
"OGAs"--other government agencies--such as the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been forthcoming on every American--well, certainly every
[Department of Defense] death in the war," Quigley said. Asked if that
meant the Pentagon would not report the activities of employees of other
agencies, such as the CIA, he said, "That's correct."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official confirmed that CIA officers were in the
area, although not necessarily in the battle. The official said he knew
of no CIA operative injured in the battle.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA official attributed the dispute over the number of dead to
"the fog of war."</TE>

<DH>'Sober companions' help ensure that a concert tour or movie shoot
goes off without a hitch by keeping artists from their addictions.</DH>

<LD>As partygoers circled around, Tim Tankosic watched a beautiful
woman expertly smuggle a pack of drugs to the movie star. It was exactly
the kind of temptation that Tankosic, a highly paid "sober companion,"
was hired to ward off.</LD>
<LD>   Soft-spoken and cerebral, with a homey, unaffected air, Tankosic
prefers to see himself as a motivational helper rather than a drug cop,
so he was relieved when the actor handed him the unused drugs as they
left the party--no hassle, no fuss.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'Thanks for doing the right thing,' " said Tankosic, 45, who
declined to identify the actor or any of his other clients. "I said,
'It's everywhere, isn't it? It's going to be like this for the rest of
your life.' "</LD>
<TE>   Only in Hollywood, where the rich employ a platoon of helpers to
insulate them from the vagaries of daily life, would there be a
full-time, paid position as a "sober companion"--also known as a "minder"
or "clean-living assistant."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to imagine a Fortune 500 company hiring a baby-sitter
to make sure the chief executive officer didn't snort cocaine before a
shareholder meeting. But film and rock stars are distinct creative
talents, one-of-a-kind performers who can make or break $100-million
movies or drive the profits of huge record companies. For some of them,
addiction has followed fame.</TE>
<TE>   In the days of Judy Garland or even John Belushi, studio flunkies and
concerned friends kept stars working by pouring coffee down their throats
or hiring bouncers to keep the drug pushers away. Today's corporate
Hollywood insists on more reliable methods. Minders are the front-line
workers, paid as much as $5,000 a week to keep fragile performers sober
and functional.</TE>
<TE>   Some recovery specialists see the practice as a quick fix that shields
the corporate bottom line while doing nothing about the underlying causes
of addiction. The minders, they say, are hired to protect the film rather
than the star.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Robert Downey Jr. and comedian Chris Farley employed
baby-sitters on movie sets and are said to have stayed clean for the
duration of the filming. But Downey later relapsed, and the 300-pound
Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these discouraging outcomes, celebrity baby-sitting is a
growth industry. Among the reasons: Addiction is not stigmatized the way
it once was. Entertainers are encouraged to confront their problems and
enter recovery programs. And the insurance industry is insisting on
preemptive steps to minimize the risk that a star's relapse will delay or
scuttle a multimillion-dollar film.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the San Francisco-based Fireman's Fund Insurance
Co., which underwrites more than half of all movies produced in this
country, said that as many as 20% of the films he has insured since last
summer included a high-risk artist with drug problems.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Kingman, a broker at AON/Albert G. Ruben Insurance Brokers, who
secures cast insurance for such studios as DreamWorks SKG and Warner
Bros., has a matter-of-fact attitude toward the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's a known substance abuse problem, you normally talk to
all of the artist's handlers, the personal doctors of the artist, the
managers and lawyers, and you basically roll up your sleeves and say,
'How can we put together a system or a product where we can package this
particular actor to the insurance marketplace so we can get cast
insurance?' " Kingman said. "We might have a substance abuse counselor
with this particular actor that is on the set and with the person 24/7."</TE>
<TE>   Tankosic, a freelance writer and former addict who has a medical
degree and extensive counseling experience, is usually hired by the
artists and paid by them or their production companies. He is an
independent baby-sitter, not associated with any treatment center.</TE>
<TE>   "The point is to be a rock," he said, "a friendly face, a reminder of
recovery, a safe person."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional support Tankosic lends his clients is not significantly
different than what members of Alcoholics Anonymous provide for one
another for free. However, many of the tasks he performs are unique to
the baby-sitter industry.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical movie location, Tankosic lives with the celebrity in a
home far from the hotel that houses the rest of the cast and crew. In the
morning, he rises with the star and they meditate together. After
breakfast, he accompanies the star to the set, and then to a support
group meeting typically held in a trailer. They might go to another such
meeting that night.</TE>
<TE>   During off-hours, Tankosic said, he tries to make sure the star has
fun, although he steers him or her clear of "slippery places"--any locale
where drugs or alcohol are available.</TE>
<TE>   Many minders are former addicts, well-practiced in identifying the
lying that usually accompanies addiction. Some bar their charges from
speaking to anyone on a movie set other than the director and key
production personnel. Others refuse to let the client out of their sight.
These minders sleep in the same room with the artist and thoroughly
search every bathroom, even looking inside the toilet tank, before the
celebrity is allowed to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Deanna MacDonald, senior entertainment underwriter for the New
Jersey-based Chubb Group of Insurance Cos., said the practice of hiring
sober companions is on the upswing. "That will become more common because
the insurance industry is tightening up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the top minders in the business said he had been employed by
every major manager in the music business. This minder, interviewed
before jetting off to an undisclosed movie set to work with an actor,
declined to be identified in print. Discretion is a critical part of the
job, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like a wisp of smoke."</TE>
<TE>Charges Up to $40,000 a Month for Services</TE>
<TE>   Baby-sitting stars in recovery is a business of referrals, with most
originating from organizations such as MusiCares, the health and human
services arm of the Grammy organization, or high-end drug rehabilitation
facilities. In the last five years, three rehab centers have popped up in
Malibu, charging as much as $40,000 a month for their complete services,
which can include a sober companion.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Malibu centers, called Promises, treated actor Ben Affleck
for alcoholism and Charlie Sheen for a cocaine and alcohol addiction. The
center helps match sober companions with stars or anyone else willing to
pay.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what we do is individualized treatment. We get people who
require those kind of sober buddies," said Richard Rogg, executive
director of Promises. "They'll take them to meetings, make sure they're
not drinking. They'll drug test them. The goal is to connect them with
12-step programs wherever they are."</TE>
<TE>   Passages, a new treatment center operating from a $10-million estate
in Malibu, recently began offering a two-week program for celebrities who
crash in the middle of filming movies.</TE>
<TE>   At a cost of $42,000, it includes rapid detoxification to break the
chemical addiction, and psychological therapy, as well as massage,
acupuncture and gourmet food. At the end of the two-week treatment, the
actor is accompanied back to the set by a recovering addict with five
years of sobriety training, no criminal record and a price tag of $2,500
a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We send the client back to the set with someone--a companion. If they
go into the bathroom, he goes in first to check for drugs," said Passages
founder Chris Prentiss. "He sleeps in the same room with them until the
shoot is over." Passages has been marketing the service directly to
insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially, baby-sitters are the movie industry's version of
catastrophic coverage. Kingman said the two-week package is worthwhile,
if you do the math. "Rather than abandoning a $20-million film, why not
spend $50,000 for this program?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   The baby-sitting itself? "It's a very boring job," said Dallas Taylor,
a recovering addict who played drums with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young
from 1969 to 1971.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 years ago, Taylor and friend Bob Timmins began helping the
families and friends of music and film stars confront their loved ones
about their addictions. They also pulled together a handful of minders to
go on the road with recovering artists and accompany them to at least one
support group meeting each day. Taylor, based in Santa Monica, oversees
this loose network of well-compensated acquaintances.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said that heroin addicts need at least six months of inpatient
treatment to recover, but that some high-profile artists have 50 people
depending on them financially. They can't afford to stop performing.</TE>
<TE>   The climate on a rock tour or movie set can be particularly hard on an
artist who is trying to navigate the world soberly, possibly for the
first time in years.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the times the guys who aren't sober are ripping you for
having to get sober yourself," said Taylor. "It's not a supportive
environment at all. But you've got a movie that has to be brought in on
time and on budget. It's not reality that someone can postpone a movie."</TE>
<TE>   That's why sober companions are so valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Some minders try to insulate their clients from the temptations and
social pressures of the set. Warren Boyd, a compact, muscular drug
counselor, runs Wavelinks, a new treatment facility in Malibu, and has
accompanied recovering addicts on about 10 film shoots.</TE>
<TE>   Using military language to describe his task, he said he always
secures the perimeter around the star and discourages any contact that is
not strictly work-related. The point is to reduce the psychological
stress on the recovering addict and protect him or her from prying eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd refused to identify any of his clients, but several sources said
Robert Downey Jr. enlisted him in his recent battles with addiction.</TE>
<TE>   The media's harsh glare has given insurance companies leverage in
their crackdown on drug-addicted celebrities. Not only have insurers
mandated the hiring of sober companions, they demand drug-testing through
the course of filming for high-risk actors. Those who balk are usually
shown press clippings reporting their drug problems.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, lawyers hire minders to keep celebrity clients clean while
they await sentencing for drug offenses. Richard Cole, a drug counselor
and former manager of the rock band Led Zeppelin, said he was hired in
1996 by Downey after a Malibu judge insisted on a minder as a condition
of Downey's probation.</TE>
<TE>   "I made it quite plain to Robert that if he screwed up, that I was
going to tell the judge," Cole said. He accompanied the actor on the sets
of "In Dreams," and "Wonder Boys," even sleeping in his hotel suite.
Downey's business managers paid Cole up to $1,500 a week.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Grillo, head of physical production for DreamWorks SKG, which
produced the 1999 thriller "In Dreams," had never seen a sober companion
before that film. "It worked really well for us," he said. "We didn't
have any problems with Robert. He was totally clean when he was working
for us."</TE>
<TE>Centers Criticized as an Expensive Gimmick</TE>
<TE>   "In Hollywood, you're as good as your gross," said addiction
specialist Joe Takamine, former chairman of an American Medical Assn.
task force on alcoholism. "The studios squeeze what they can out of them
like a lemon and then say, 'Now, go do your thing and fall down.' What
happens after the picture?"</TE>
<TE>   Takamine is skeptical not only of the minders, but of the plush rehab
centers that promote their use. He believes they are expensive gimmicks
that cater to celebrities' narcissism.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't send a sick puppy there," he said. "Their definition of
detox is massage or riding a horse. They are catering to the rich and
famous."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that Affleck, while in treatment at Promises, left to accept
a Teen Choice award at Universal City in August. "You create a feeling in
some of these places that you're unique," Takamine said. "That's what
many of them die from--terminal uniqueness."</TE>
<TE>   Rogg, the director of Promises, called Takamine archaic and said
Affleck went to the awards ceremony with a qualified staff member.
Friends, family and business associates are often reluctant to confront
celebrities about their lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a vested interest in keeping someone rich happy," said
Dan Beardshear, a former counselor at the Betty Ford Clinic. He cited
Chris Farley as an example.</TE>
<TE>   "I urged [his associates] to put an intervention together. They said,
'We don't want to ruin his career.' But, hell, he had already fallen off
the stage a couple of times."</TE>
<TE>   Farley eventually did try to get sober. Harold Owens, an addiction
recovery specialist for MusiCares, worked as his minder on at least one
unidentified film.</TE>
<TE>   "The producers on the film said he had to have somebody with him. That
was the condition for him working," Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   After the film was over, Farley relapsed, and in December 1997 he was
found dead in his Chicago apartment of an overdose of cocaine and
morphine. He was 33.</TE>
<TE>   But in the right circumstances, a sober companion can help an artist
beat addiction, said Jim Stillwell, executive director of Impact, one of
Los Angeles' oldest rehab facilities, whose clients range from
ex-convicts to celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have somebody who's demonstrated a commitment to recovery, and
using this sober buddy to enhance that person's participation in the
recovery activity while they're on the road, then you're getting bang for
the buck," Stillwell said. Baby-sitting a recovering star is not easy
work.</TE>
<TE>   Prentiss, founder of the Passages treatment center, tells of
celebrities who tried to bribe their minders, offering as much as $50,000
to look the other way while they sneaked a drink or a snort of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Minders can succumb. Cole, who kept Downey clean for a few months,
suffered a relapse after 15 years of sobriety. He recently got hooked on
Vicodin while taking it to ease the pain from bone spurs in his shoulder
and back.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Cole checked himself into a sober-living house in West Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Scandal Puts New Focus on Celibacy</HD>
<DH>Catholics: Cardinal Mahony's remarks add to growing debate on
marriage and priesthood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Celibacy, a cornerstone of the Roman Catholic priesthood for a
thousand years and a symbol of ordained holiness, is being questioned
with a new urgency as the church's sexual abuse scandal sweeps across the
nation.</LD>
<LD>   In a sharp departure from Pope John Paul II's insistence that the
celibacy issue is closed, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony on Monday became the
first American cardinal to declare that discussion of a married
priesthood remains open.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony's willingness to debate celibacy is further evidence that the
widening sexual abuse scandal is forcing church leaders to examine the
nature of the Catholic priesthood, church experts said.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles archbishop's candid remarks Monday night are certain
to reach the Vatican, where John Paul has been unbending in his
opposition to married priests.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's remarks after a Mass in Long Beach appear to contradict the
Holy See. "I've never said that we can't discuss these things," Mahony
said, adding that Eastern rite Catholic priests can marry. "It works out
fine."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's comments marked the third time this week that celibacy has
been raised in a major American archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the official newspaper of the Boston archdiocese,
headed by Cardinal Bernard Law, called celibacy an issue that "simply
will not disappear." The newspaper said the issue had gained new currency
among the nation's 62 million Catholics, most of whom disagree with their
church's position.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, Archbishop Rembert Weakland--one of the most liberal of
U.S. bishops--wrote in a March 19 letter, "Perhaps this will be the
moment when the larger issue of priestly ministry in the church will be
faced." Weakland said he was more open to married clergy after visiting
Eastern Orthodox churches around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland said another door was opened when the pope allowed married
Episcopal priests to convert to Catholic priests. Such discussions, he
wrote, "could be the kind of breakthrough that will force us to move
ahead in unexpected ways."</TE>
<TE>   The statements from Boston and Los Angeles are given great weight
because the two cardinals are considered among the most powerful Catholic
leaders in the United States. Mahony is seen as one of the American
church's more liberal cardinals, while Law is considered one of the
nation's most conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has been unquestionably loyal to Catholic doctrine. His
remarks, delivered after a sermon to 300 of his priests, show clearly
"that this is a live issue that can't be swept under the carpet," said
Father Tom Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not the pastor of a Podunk parish," Reese said. "He's one of the
most visible Catholic bishops in the U.S. For him to bring this up is
certainly important."</TE>
<TE>   Reese added that Mahony's remarks would probably add to the momentum
of the informal discussions that have been held for years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a significant statement and for many a sign of hope because many
perceive the American Catholic bishops as a very cautious, conservative
group, looking constantly over their shoulder at the Vatican," Father
Richard P. McBrien, professor of theology at the University of Notre
Dame, said Tuesday. No one in the church, either in the United States or
elsewhere, believes there is any serious likelihood that a married
priesthood will come during the reign of John Paul. Indeed, neither
Mahony nor the Boston Catholic newspaper suggested they necessarily
favored making celibacy an option.</TE>
<TE>   A week after the Boston newspaper's March 15 editorial it published a
second story that sought to calm the controversy. The paper said it only
reported what rank-and-file Catholics are saying about celibacy. Cardinal
Law, the newspaper's publisher, distanced himself from the editorial,
saying: "It is one thing to report the questions of others; it is quite
another thing to make those questions one's own."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said Monday that he was glad the paper raised the issue, noting
that the Catholic Church had for 1,100 years allowed its priests to
marry. "The Eastern Catholic churches have always had a married
priesthood, and it works out fine," he said. "So I think it should be
discussed."</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether he had a personal view, Mahony said, "No, I just
think it should be very much discussed." He added, "When I do, I'll let
you know."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said his only regret about the Boston editorial was that it may
have left the misimpression that celibacy is linked to sexual abuse.
Psychologists and other experts on sexual development say there is no
correlation.</TE>
<TE>   "Most pedophiles are married," said Father Curtis Bryant, a Los
Angeles psychologist and former director of inpatient clinical services
at St. Luke Institute in Washington. The institute treats priests
involved in sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   He said older men entering the seminary have more life experience and
are more likely to have completed their psychosexual development. That
makes for a healthy priest, Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Celibacy has been a contentious issue in the American church and
throughout the church's 2,000-year history. It was observed in varying
degrees over the ages. In the church's early history, the Apostle Paul
urged followers not to marry because Christians in those days believed
Jesus' Second Coming was imminent. Later, celibacy became an issue
because of disputes over property rights: Who would inherit the estate of
a dead priest? His wife or the church? The issue was settled by the first
and second Lateran Councils in 1123 and 1139, which declared that
priestly orders were an impediment to marriage and marriage an impediment
to priestly orders.</TE>
<TE>   But rules on celibacy in the priesthood can be changed. The ban on sex
is considered a church discipline, rather than immutable dogma.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul's age and failing health are prompting some in the church to
say the next pope could have a different view on celibacy. Church leaders
say most of the bishops appointed by John Paul will turn 75 over the next
10 years, paving the way for possible change in coming generations.</TE>
<TE>   A more immediate concern is the diminishing number of priests. In 1980
there were 58,621 priests in the United States. Ten years later, that
number had fallen to 53,111. Last year, there were 46,075. Advocates of
optional celibacy argue a change would draw more men into the priesthood.
A Newsweek poll this week found that 79% of all Americans and 69% of
Catholics favored allowing married men to be ordained as priests.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the discussion of marriage among priests has been an
unexpected consequence of the sex abuse scandal in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "One bright spot in this whole horrible business of the sex abuse
scandals is that it does seem to be creating an atmosphere for
transformation," said Linda Pieczynski of Call to Action, a Chicago-based
unofficial Catholic reform group. "The openness with which Cardinal
Mahony is approaching this issue shows that the bishops are starting to
realize what the people in the pews have been saying for years."</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives were caught off guard by Mahony's statement.</TE>
<TE>   George Weigel, author of an extensive biography of the pope, said
Tuesday that he found Mahony's remarks "a little puzzling." He said he
expected the celibacy rule to remain intact.</TE>
<TE>   But, Weigel said, there should be a discussion of a reformed
priesthood without unraveling the discipline of celibacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Living a chaste, celibate life has to be talked about much more
openly, much more assertively in seminaries," Weigel said. "Celibacy is
not the problem. The problem is men not living the celibate commitment
they have made."</TE>
<TE>   In St. Louis, Helen Hull Hitchcock, director of Women for Faith and
Family and an editor of a conservative liturgical journal, said she was
not surprised by the new calls for optional celibacy. She said that for
those who favor married priests--which she doesn't--now is the time to
press the issue.</TE>

<CX>   Priests and marriage--A story in Wednesday's Section A on celibacy
in the Roman Catholic Church incorrectly implied that Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony said priests in the church's Eastern Rite can marry. Mahony said
only that Eastern Rite priests can be married. Although the church will
ordain married men as Eastern Rite priests, if a priest is single at the
time of his ordination he may not later marry.</CX>

<HD>Quake Kills Over 1,200 in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Residents search for family members buried when mud-brick
homes crashed down. Northern town is a heap of rubble.</DH>

<DL>NAHRIN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>More than 1,200 people were killed when a powerful nighttime
earthquake flattened thousands of homes and leveled a district capital in
the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains, government officials said
today.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude 5.9 quake wiped out the town of Nahrin, 105 miles north
of Kabul, the capital, and more than 600 bodies have been pulled from the
rubble, said Interior Minister Younis Qanooni.</LD>
<LD>   As Qanooni toured the devastated area this morning, men covered in a
glaze of dust and sweat picked through 8-foot-high piles of debris,
loading horses and donkeys with what goods they could salvage.</LD>
<TE>   Many roads were clogged with boulders, thin almond trees had been
pushed over, and hundreds of mud-brick homes looked like a giant fist had
smashed through them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very bad scene," Qanooni said. "We have found 600 bodies,
and there is at least that many still buried."</TE>
<TE>   The quake, or zelzilla in Dari, hit about 7:30 p.m. local time Monday,
when most Nahrin residents were in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Shopkeeper Mohammed Haji Sayed was drinking tea in his living room,
watching his daughter work on her lessons. He felt the ground heave,
heard the snap of wooden ceiling beams and saw the roof crash down on
10-year-old Payrai, burying her.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get to her; I couldn't move," he said. "She looked up at
me. She yelled. Then she was underground."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Sayed laid his girl to rest in a grave near their home.
But he was still digging furiously through the rubble today, looking for
her notebooks.</TE>
<TE>Aid Transported Over Tortuous Roads</TE>
<TE>   Nahrin is in a remote part of the northeastern province of Baghlan,
and the extent of devastation was not clear until Tuesday afternoon, when
reports began to trickle out of the villages of hundreds of people
killed. Aid agencies launched a massive emergency assistance effort from
two directions to help.</TE>
<TE>   Tents, blankets, food, stoves, medicine and at least one mobile clinic
were sent to the area over tortuous, unpaved roads, with officials
voicing fear that many people would die from injuries before they could
be reached and treated.</TE>
<TE>   Relief organizations in Kabul, a 10-hour drive from the south over the
high, snow-covered Salang Pass, and in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, a four-hour drive to the west, dispatched truck convoys
that were arriving throughout the night Tuesday and early today.</TE>
<TE>   But the relief efforts were hampered by aftershocks and by roads still
scattered with debris from an earthquake that struck earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a desperate situation, and we're sending everything we got,"
said Richard Piper of the International Organization for Migration, who
is based in Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who flew over the area saw utter devastation," said Yusuf
Hassan, a United Nations spokesman in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   There were conflicting reports about the number of deaths, some
reaching as high as 4,000 and some in the hundreds, but officials said
this was understandable in a country without a working telephone network
or good road system, where covering even relatively short distances can
take hours.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, speaking outside the sandbagged
U.S. Embassy in Kabul at noon Tuesday, stunned reporters when he said
that he had just been told by the country's interim administration that
the death toll was at least 1,800. He pledged immediate U.S. support to
help the victims.</TE>
<TE>   No foreigners were believed to be among the missing or dead. Brig.
Gen. John W. Rosa Jr. said at a Pentagon briefing Tuesday that no U.S. or
other coalition forces were hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul radio and television said 5,000 people had been injured in the
earthquake and subsequent jolts, some as big as magnitude 5.</TE>
<TE>   More than 12,000 yards of white cloth had been sent to wrap the dead,
the television reported. Some reports said that 30,000 people were
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, who had been scheduled to go to
Turkey today, canceled his trip in order to attend to the disaster. He
was expected to visit the area today.</TE>
<TE>'The Administration Is Doing the Best It Can'</TE>
<TE>   His spokesman Yusuf Nuristani said the government was allocating
$600,000 for immediate emergency assistance, and he pledged $147 to each
family of those killed and $88 for families suffering injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration is doing the best it can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Nahrin, as in most Afghan towns, the great majority of houses are
made of mud bricks, with tree branches and skinny logs used as support
beams.</TE>
<TE>   In some older parts of the stricken area, entire streets were erased,
with children and dogs climbing over the rubble that was left.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, violent aftershocks continued to jar residents, who
yelled out "Zelzilla! Zelzilla!" and ran to open spaces. Some people were
upset that few relief convoys had arrived. "Nobody has come here, not
even to look," said Gholam Sakhi, one of the elders in Nahrin.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Khalil, a military commander from nearby Pul-i-Kumri, ordered two
military helicopters to ferry out the injured but said dozens more were
needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is trying to find the members of their families to bring
them out of the destroyed walls or collapsed areas," Khalil said. "The
earthquake is going on, and each time, the people are very afraid."</TE>
<TE>U.N. Arranges Helicopter Surveys</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, U.N. officials were arranging helicopter flights to
survey the area, while big blue UNICEF trucks chugged through a barren
moonlit landscape notorious for bandits.</TE>
<TE>   When the quake hit, tremors could be felt in Islamabad, the Pakistani
capital, nearly 300 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Geological Survey said Monday's quake was relatively shallow,
about 40 miles beneath the surface, which made it more dangerous than
most temblors its size.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's quake was the second serious temblor to batter Afghanistan
this month. More than 100 people were buried by a quake-triggered
landslide in Samangan province on March 3.</TE>
<TE>   That quake, the strongest in the region since 1983, was magnitude 7.2.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. spokesman Hassan described the region as one already ravaged by
drought and by the war between the former Taliban regime and Northern
Alliance forces, and said that it had more recently seen tensions between
members of the Tajik and Pushtun ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an area that has seen more than enough share of misfortune," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gettleman reported from Nahrin and Daniszewski from Kabul.</TE>

<HD>Detainees to Be Freed in Kosovo</HD>
<DH>Yugoslavia: Ethnic Albanians' release will meet one condition to
keep U.S. aid flowing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<AU>BLERIM GJOCI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Cheering relatives, friends and supporters of 145 ethnic Albanians
who had been held prisoner elsewhere in Serbia greeted their arrival
Tuesday in the province of Kosovo. Most of the detainees were expected to
be released today by international authorities.</LD>
<LD>   More than 2,000 ethnic Albanian prisoners--many of them suspected
guerrilla fighters--were moved out of the province in mid-1999, before
peacekeepers entered it after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
air war to prevent the repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the detainees were gradually released, and Tuesday's transfer
means that virtually none remain in Serbia, according to authorities in
Belgrade, the capital of both Yugoslavia and Serbia, its main republic.</LD>
<TE>   Serbian authorities had charged most of the prisoners with terrorism
or ordinary crimes, but ethnic Albanians in Kosovo viewed almost all of
them as political detainees or hostages.</TE>
<TE>   The release fulfills one of the key conditions demanded by U.S.
legislation in order for Belgrade to continue receiving American aid
beyond the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Steiner, the head of the United Nations administration in
Kosovo, welcomed the transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who have not committed crimes will be released, most of them
tomorrow, the rest within weeks, not months," Steiner said.</TE>
<TE>   Those determined to be guilty of crimes "will serve out their
sentences not in Serbia [proper] but here in Kosovo," Steiner said.</TE>
<TE>   Until the prisoners' arrival Tuesday, many people in Kosovo had
believed that about 500 ethnic Albanians were still being held elsewhere
in Serbia. But in a sign of increasing acceptance of the idea that the
total might be much smaller, Radio Television 21, an Albanian-language
station in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, referred to Tuesday's
transfer as covering "all" prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Although the prisoner release should help the Serbian government's
standing with Washington and other foreign governments, the most
important condition in the U.S. financial aid legislation is that
Yugoslavia cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
There has been widespread speculation in Belgrade that Serbian
authorities might arrest several war crimes suspects and transfer them to
the tribunal by early next week in an effort to satisfy that requirement.
About $40 million of badly needed aid is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue of extradition of war crimes suspects has become
entangled in domestic politics amid a deepening power struggle between
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran
Djindjic. Djindjic is seen as more willing to cooperate with the tribunal
than is Kostunica.</TE>
<TE>   There are fears that if Djindjic orders such arrests despite
Kostunica's opposition, a full-scale political crisis could erupt in
Belgrade, with uncertain results for political and economic reforms in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher praised the
prisoner transfer as "an important step forward in the establishment of
the rule of law in the region." He added, however, that Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell had not yet decided whether Belgrade had met the
conditions of the financial aid law.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's transfer did not include ethnic Albanians arrested for
crimes committed outside Kosovo, said Goran Jovicic, a Serbian government
official. He was referring primarily to prisoners detained as a result of
fighting between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and government forces in
southern Serbia's Presevo Valley from mid-1999 to last year.</TE>
<TE>   Seven ethnic Albanian prisoners from Kosovo declined to be
transferred, the Serbian Justice Ministry said.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. buses carrying the prisoners entered Kosovo at a crossing where
several hundred people had gathered to welcome them. The buses did not
stop but went on to the Dubrava prison near the town of Istok, where the
prisoners were to spend the night. Along the route were thousands of
people cheering and waving red-and-black Albanian flags.</TE>
<TE>   Belgrade officials referred to the transfer as an exchange and
expressed hope that the U.N. administration in Kosovo would allow at
least some of 38 Serbs imprisoned here to serve out their sentences
elsewhere in Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner said he did not consider the transfer part of an exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of Serbs in Kosovo issued a statement expressing displeasure
with the release. Serbian media in Belgrade quoted displaced Serbs from
Kosovo who complained that all the ethnic Albanian prisoners were being
freed while 1,300 Kosovo Serbs remain missing.</TE>
<TE>   Some ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were also dissatisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "Serbs got away again with a good deal," said Lirak Celaj, a Kosovo
lawmaker. "They're using this type of thing right before the deadline. .
. . Then they get great rewards, much more than what they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Holley reported from Warsaw and special correspondent
Gjoci from Pristina. Special correspondent Zoran Cirjakovic in Belgrade
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ship Denied Port Call in Hong Kong</HD>
<DH>Asia: Chinese officials signal that the rejection is in response to
the Bush administration's overtures to Taiwan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>China has refused to allow an American naval warship to enter Hong
Kong harbor for a routine port call next week, U.S. officials said
Tuesday, in a sign of simmering tensions between Beijing and Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Zigli, spokeswoman for the U.S. Consulate here, said the
Chinese government gave no explanation for denying the request for the
destroyer Curtis Wilbur to visit Hong Kong on April 5-9.</LD>
<LD>   The request, described by Zigli as routine, was made within the
framework of a 5-year-old agreement between the countries that governs
visits of U.S. military ships and aircraft to Hong Kong, a British colony
that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   At a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue reminded reporters that such visits are approved
on a "case-by-case basis."</TE>
<TE>   She also left little doubt that the rejection of the port call request
was directly connected to recent U.S. moves involving Taiwan, which China
considers a renegade province.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang demanded that the United States "cease interfering in China's
internal affairs by using Taiwan issues and undermining bilateral ties."</TE>
<TE>   "To secure a healthy and smooth development of bilateral ties, the
U.S. side should properly handle this question," she warned.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing is believed to be especially upset about the Bush
administration's decision to allow Taiwan's defense minister, Tang
Yiau-ming, to attend a privately funded defense seminar in Florida
earlier this month. It marked the latest in a series of steps by
President Bush that have demonstrated a new level of support for the
island in the 14 months since he took office.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bush declared that the United States would do whatever was
necessary to defend Taiwan, apparently hardening America's defense
commitment to the island. The administration also offered to sell Taiwan
a large package of armaments last year.</TE>
<TE>   Tang is the first Taiwanese defense minister to visit the United
States since President Carter severed formal diplomatic ties with Taipei
in 1979 as the price of normalizing relations with Communist China.
Beijing strenuously opposes any high-level contact between the island's
leadership and Western governments.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration reportedly was prepared to grant a visa to
Taiwan's former president, Lee Teng-hui, who had planned to travel to the
United States in June. But Lee has since stated that he would stay home
because of health reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The ease with which U.S. requests for military port calls in Hong Kong
are either rejected or approved has become a kind of de facto bellwether
on the state of Sino-American relations.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Beijing rejected a U.S. port call request was in May,
when a planned visit by the mine countermeasures support ship Inchon for
the following month was turned down. That refusal came as relations
between the two countries had deteriorated sharply in the wake of a
collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. reconnaissance plane
near China's Hainan island in April.</TE>
<TE>   The latest denial, which Zigli said the U.S. received eight days ago,
was made public Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts in Hong Kong believe that the refusal to let the Wilbur call
in Hong Kong stems more from the Tang visit than any other development.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Broadfoot, managing director of Hong Kong-based Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy, described the action made public Tuesday as "a
quick, measured retaliation for the [Taiwanese] defense minister's visit
to the United States."</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably one of the more modest ways to register displeasure
about this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao, heir apparent to President and
Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin, is expected to visit the United
States this spring.</TE>
<TE>   On average, 50 to 60 U.S. warships have visited Hong Kong each year
since 1997. Since the Inchon was refused entry, two seven-ship aircraft
carrier battle groups have made calls in Hong Kong, in August and
November.</TE>
<TE>   The Wilbur was scheduled to complete a joint exercise today with the
South Korean navy near that country's coast. Its last port of call was
the southern Korean city of Pusan.</TE>

<HD>Arab TV Network Cancels Interview With Sharon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIRUT
</DL>
<LD>The Al Jazeera satellite television network announced Tuesday that
it had canceled an interview with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   The Arab world's best-known broadcaster cited Israeli "technical
conditions" in announcing the cancellation.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement coincided, however, with a protest outside Al
Jazeera's office at the Arab League summit, where demonstrating
journalists presented a petition against the interview.</LD>
<TE>   The petition, signed by 148 of the 2,300 accredited summit
journalists, condemned Qatar-based Al Jazeera for planning to interview
"the Zionist criminal Ariel Sharon, killer of Arab women, children and
the elderly."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo wrote to Al Jazeera
asking that the interview be canceled, saying Sharon did not deserve the
honor of appearing on the well-respected network.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate Al Jazeera's role, and despite our consideration for
the freedom of the press and freedom of opinion, it is not justified for
a prominent Arab satellite channel to interview Sharon," Abed-Rabbo said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is reviled in Lebanon for his role in the 1982 massacre of
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps during Israel's
occupation of Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli commission of inquiry later found him indirectly
responsible, and he had to resign as defense minister.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it is appropriate that he, a war criminal, be given a
chance to appear on an Arab media platform," said Abdelsalam Akel, a

<HD>2 Observers Killed in West Bank</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Unarmed international monitors are shot to death on road
often used by settlers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Two international monitors were killed Tuesday when their
well-marked car came under fire near the West Bank city of Hebron.</LD>
<LD>   A survivor and the Israeli army said the gunman was a Palestinian
targeting a road often used by Jewish settlers. Palestinian officials
blamed Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   The two dead, a Turkish man and a woman who was described in some
reports as Swiss and in others as Swedish, were members of a force of
unarmed monitors created in 1994 to observe tensions between a tiny
enclave of radical Jewish settlers and a large Palestinian majority in
the Hebron area, in the wake of an assassination by a radical Jew of more
than two dozen Palestinians worshiping at a mosque.</LD>
<TE>   Turkish television identified the male observer as Maj. Cengiz
Soytunc. Capt. Hussein Ozar Salam, also Turkish, was wounded, the report
said. The woman was not immediately identified.</TE>
<TE>   The observer group, the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, is
much maligned, accused by Palestinians of being ineffectual and by Jewish
settlers of being pro-Palestinian.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time that international monitors have been killed in
the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has claimed more than
1,500 lives in the last year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Salam said a Palestinian gunman shot at the car from close range,
injuring him and killing the two other monitors.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority and Hebron hospital officials denied that
Palestinians were involved and blamed the attack on the army.</TE>
<TE>   Salam said he saw the gunman from the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   "The [car] lights were on and we saw him. He was in a Palestinian
police force uniform. He was carrying a Kalashnikov and we shouted to him
that we are [from the observer force] TIPH, don't shoot toward us. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "He kept on shooting toward us and [my] colleagues were sitting in the
front seat, just dead. The driver's blood splashed on my face," Salam
told Israel Radio in an interview from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh said bullets recovered from the bodies,
which were taken to a Palestinian hospital, were the type used by the
Israeli army.</TE>
<TE>   Hebron is one of the most volatile cities in the West Bank. About 450
Jewish settlers live in enclaves in the center of the city, among more
than 100,000 Palestinians. The observers use clearly marked white cars.</TE>

<HD>Russia Orders U.S.-Based Ex-Spymaster Home to Face Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The Russian secret service has ordered a former Soviet KGB
spymaster now living in Washington to return immediately to Moscow to
face charges, reportedly for his role in helping U.S. authorities
identify and convict a former Soviet spy in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   A Russian Embassy consular official in Washington hand-delivered a
subpoena Monday to Oleg Kalugin, who directed KGB foreign intelligence
operations at the height of the Cold War. Kalugin is now a media
commentator, author and consultant on espionage and counterintelligence.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Joyal, Kalugin's business partner in Washington, said the former
KGB major general intended to ignore the summons.</LD>
<TE>   "He does not plan to go," Joyal said. "It's ridiculous, utterly
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The document demanded that Kalugin appear for questioning "as a
defendant" at the Moscow office of the Federal Security Service, the
domestic successor agency to the KGB, at 10 a.m. Thursday. Under Russian
law, the subpoena said, "should you fail to appear without adequate
explanation, your appearance may be compelled by force."</TE>
<TE>   Russian news reports said Kalugin, a Russian who is seeking U.S.
citizenship, faces charges of high treason.</TE>
<TE>   According to NTV television, Kalugin was charged because of his role
in the federal trial last June in Tampa, Fla., of George Trofimoff, a
retired Army Reserve colonel who is the highest-ranking U.S. military
officer charged with espionage.</TE>
<TE>   Subpoenaed as a prosecution witness, Kalugin identified Trofimoff as a
prized KGB agent who had provided top-secret U.S. documents to Moscow for
25 years. Kalugin's testimony helped convict Trofimoff, who is serving a
life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Yevgeniy Khorishko, a Russian Embassy spokesman in Washington, said he
could not confirm that the charges were based on the Trofimoff case.</TE>
<TE>   "He is being accused, but we don't know of what," Khorishko said.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian security service appears to have scant legal leverage to
force Kalugin to return. Khorishko said Russia had not decided whether to
seek extradition.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokesman said that information on the case was
still sketchy and that she could not comment. Kalugin was out of town
Tuesday and could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin, now 67, served for 12 years as a Soviet spy in Washington
before returning home to run the KGB's foreign intelligence program. He
was forced out of the spy service in 1990 for criticizing it publicly.
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, restored Kalugin's rank
and honors in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin did not stay long in Russia, but unlike many former
intelligence officials now in the West, he did not defect. Instead, he
took advantage of the collapse of the Soviet Union to move to Washington
in 1995, write his memoirs and earn a prosperous living off his former
profession.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he has taught and consulted on counterintelligence
for U.S. intelligence agencies, national nuclear laboratories and private
companies. As a sideline, he has helped lead bus tours of espionage sites
used since the 1950s by well-known spies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin is known to be widely disliked within the Federal Security
Service, known as the FSB. In 2000, acting Russian President Vladimir V.
Putin--himself a former KGB officer--denounced Kalugin as a "traitor." In
response, Kalugin wrote Putin a letter insisting that he had not been
convicted of any crime and should be presumed innocent. Afterward,
Kalugin applied for political asylum in the United States, according to
NTV.</TE>
<TE>   Kalugin made headlines in the early 1990s with assertions that KGB
officers had interviewed American POWs in Vietnam after 1973, when Hanoi
was insisting that none remained in the country. In 1993, British police
detained Kalugin in London for questioning about his role in the 1978
poisoned umbrella assassination of a BBC correspondent. He was released
after less than 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Konstantin G. Preobrazhensky, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who left
the service in 1991, said the FSB's attempt to press treason charges
against Kalugin appeared to be a form of retribution for Kalugin's
revelations over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an open secret that Kalugin was one of the people who helped
bring about the collapse of the KGB system and is widely considered a
traitor by many KGB officers, both retired and in active service,"
Preobrazhensky said.</TE>
<TE>   Boris Kuznetsov, a Moscow lawyer with expertise in extradition cases
who is also an acquaintance of Kalugin, said that even though Kalugin is
not a U.S. citizen, the FSB is unlikely to win his extradition.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, the subpoena from Moscow, worded in such a strong language,
will do Kalugin more good than harm," Kuznetsov said. "The subpoena will
provide sufficient grounds for granting Kalugin political asylum. In
fact, Kalugin will look like a victim--he can easily prove that he is
persecuted in Russia and is persecuted by the organization that he used
to criticize, the KGB."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds reported from Moscow and Drogin from Washington. Alexei V.
Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Kills 8, French Police Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NANTERRE, France
</DL>
<LD>A man opened fire with automatic pistols at the end of a city
council meeting in a Paris suburb early today, killing at least eight
people and wounding about 30 others, including 14 seriously, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested the suspect, who was described as someone who was
active in local politics and had attended several council meetings. The
man did not speak during the shooting and did not make any clear
statement when he was arrested, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The attacker used at least two automatic pistols, said rescue worker
Laurent Vibert, and 50 shells were scattered inside the meeting room.
Vibert said the suspect, reportedly in his 30s, was apparently a member
of the leftist Green Party.</LD>
<TE>   "It's apparently a case of furious dementia," said Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, who rushed to the scene. "A horrifying tragedy that harms
democracy--a city council meeting in action."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of police vehicles and more than 100 rescue officials rushed to
the scene. A rescue helicopter took some of the wounded to a nearby
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The bloody rampage took place at about 1:15 a.m. as about 40 people
attending the meeting were putting on their coats to leave. Nanterre is a
middle-class neighborhood near a business district of western Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Local Mayor Jacqueline Fraysse said she did not know the attacker.
There had been no heated debate and the meeting was ending quietly when
the shooting began, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I ended the session," she said. "A man got up. He had been sitting in
the public area. He shot straight in front of him, and then he moved to
where the council members were sitting."</TE>
<TE>   "He said nothing," she said. "It was long. It lasted many minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Rising crime is at the top of France's political agenda ahead of
presidential elections next month.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of police officers held nationwide strikes in December,
saying they deserve more pay and better equipment because their jobs have
become increasingly risky. The protests began after two officers were
shot and killed during an armed robbery in a Paris suburb in October.</TE>
<TE>   Also in October, a masked gunman opened fire in the central French
city of Tours, killing four people.</TE>
<TE>   In an assault in Switzerland in September, a 57-year-old man opened
fire with an assault rifle at a meeting of a cantonal legislature,
killing 14 people before killing himself with a handgun.</TE>

<HD>Indian Parliament OKs Anti-Terrorism Bill in Joint Session</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers in India approved an anti-terrorism bill Tuesday after a
day of heated debate in a highly unusual joint session of Parliament,
only the third since the country's independence.</LD>
<LD>   The government said the legislation is crucial after the Sept. 11
attacks in the United States and a Dec. 13 attack on the Indian
Parliament.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot score a decisive victory against terrorism unless a special
law of this kind is enacted," Home Affairs Minister Lal Krishna Advani
said as he presented the bill.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents denounced the bill as a draconian curtailment of civil
rights and voiced fears that the Hindu nationalist-led government would
use the law selectively against Muslims and political rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The Prevention of Terrorism bill would allow police to detain suspects
for questioning for three months without bringing charges against them
and for an additional three months with approval from a special court. It
also would allow anyone suspected of giving money, shelter,
transportation or other support to terrorists to be tried on terrorism
charges.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also provides for punishments ranging from a minimum of five
years in prison to death.</TE>
<TE>   The government says the law will be effective against Islamic
separatists in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state.
India blames the militants for the attack on Parliament and says they
were aided by neighboring Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was rejected last week by the upper house, which is dominated
by the opposition Congress Party. To break the deadlock, Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee called the joint session.</TE>
<TE>   After nine hours of debate, the bill passed 425-296, with some
lawmakers absent or abstaining. The figurehead president, Kocheril Raman
Narayanan, was expected to sign the legislation within a week.</TE>
<TE>   Sonia Gandhi, leader of the Congress Party, said the law violates
individual rights.</TE>
<TE>   "This government has revealed its true intentions by using every
device to arm itself with . . . menacing powers," she said.</TE>

<HD>Space Launch a Boost to China and Jiang's Legacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>It was a small step in China's manned space program but a giant
leap in the Chinese president's quest for a place in history.</LD>
<LD>   Flanked by army officers, with a broad grin on his face, President
Jiang Zemin watched proudly Monday night as China fired the third in a
series of unmanned test capsules into orbit.</LD>
<LD>   "Comrades, the launch of the Shenzhou III spaceship was a success!"
Jiang said after a Long March 2-F rocket carried the craft into orbit.
"This is a new milestone in the development of our aerospace industry. I,
like everyone, am very happy."</LD>
<TE>   Jiang's attendance at the launch was a sign of his Communist
government's growing confidence in the viability of its ambitious
decade-old program.</TE>
<TE>   China hopes to join Russia and the United States as the only nations
to have sent people into space, and it says it aims eventually to have a
permanently staffed space station.</TE>
<TE>   "Manned spaceflight is just the first step," the official New China
News Agency quoted Jiang as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Although a manned launch may not come before Jiang's expected
retirement as head of the Communist Party this fall and as president next
year, success could boost the 75-year-old leader's drive to be enshrined
in Chinese history alongside Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping.</TE>
<TE>   State television devoted considerable portions of its midday and
evening national news broadcasts to Jiang's visit to the Jiuquan launch
center, near where the Great Wall ends in the desert of northern China's
Gansu province.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the Chinese army's heavy role in the secretive manned
program, code-named Project 921, Jiang wore a green military-style suit.
He delivered a speech against a backdrop of images of the red Chinese
flag and firework-festooned Tiananmen Gate that overlooks Beijing's famed
square.</TE>
<TE>   The launch "greatly boosted the whole nation's morale," Jiang told
army officers and engineers he met Tuesday during an inspection of the
launch center.</TE>
<TE>   It "shows that the Chinese people are perfectly capable of
understanding the most advanced technologies by making their own
innovations and can be part of the high-tech world," Jiang said.</TE>
<TE>   China has not said when its first "taikonauts," coined from the
Chinese word for outer space, will blast into orbit.</TE>
<TE>   But the news agency said the Shenzhou III vessel "can carry out all
the functions of a manned craft" and was carrying "dummy astronauts" as
well as instruments to simulate and monitor human vital signs. Data
gathered would be used to improve life-support systems on future craft,
it said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists for the first time also tested an emergency escape system
for astronauts during the launch, state media said.</TE>

<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>The head of a Cali-based gang that allegedly trains young assassins
was arrested in the slaying of the city's archbishop, officials said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   John Jairo Maturana was arrested in a police-army operation Monday in
Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. Authorities said they believed that
Maturana had information about the slaying of Archbishop Isaias Duarte
Cancino or took part in the killing.</LD>
<LD>   Maturana's was the first major arrest in the March 16 killing.</LD>
<TE>   The archbishop was killed as he left a group wedding in an

<TE>   Authorities have said they suspect that cocaine traffickers were
behind the slaying.</TE>

<HD>Havana Blames Mexican Minister for Castro Exit</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still smarting at a perceived snub during a U.N. summit last week,
Cuba blasted Mexico's "diabolical" and "Machiavellian" foreign minister
as the man responsible for President Fidel Castro's walkout at the event.</LD>
<LD>   A statement by the ruling Communist Party blamed the Mexican minister,
Jorge Castaneda, for pressuring Castro to stay away from the meeting in
Monterrey, Mexico, to avoid a politically awkward crossing with President
Bush. Castro eventually attended the development summit but created a
diplomatic flurry with a dramatic walkout.</LD>
<LD>   Cuban officials in Havana later alleged that Castro was pressured by
Mexico, on behalf of the U.S., first not to attend, then to leave before
Bush's arrival. Castaneda has denied the charges.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Italian unions announced a one-day general strike for April 16 to
denounce government plans for labor reform, but Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi shrugged off the planned protest and vowed to press ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The showdown with the big three unions, which together represent about
12 million people, is shaping up to be the worst labor dispute in Italy
in 20 years and could stunt the country's fragile economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The government says its reform would boost labor flexibility and bring
Italian laws into line with European norms. Unions say the changes would
make it easier to fire staff and offer no welfare safety net for the
unemployed.</LD>

<LD>French Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin stirred controversy
by suggesting that occasional smokers of cannabis should be treated with
leniency.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of conservative President Jacques Chirac, his neck-and-neck
rival in the April 21 vote, slammed the remarks as irresponsible, while
the pro-legalization lobby called for a debate on reform of France's
tough drug laws.</LD>
<LD>   Jospin said legalization would send the wrong signal to the young but
insisted that France's 32-year-old drug laws should be applied "in an
intelligent manner" toward users.</LD>

<LD>   The contest has been held every other year since 1988 without official
recognition.</LD>

<DH>Asia: Defense officials play down reports of recent sightings of Al
Qaeda leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>American forces are closely watching volatile eastern Afghanistan
but have not yet figured out exactly how many Al Qaeda and Taliban
members are hiding there and what they are up to, defense officials said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   They played down a report by Afghans of recent sightings of Al Qaeda
leader Osama bin Laden and top aide Ayman Zawahiri in the area near the
city of Khowst.</LD>
<LD>   "The Khowst area is a tense situation. . . . It remains a dangerous
place," Air Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr. said at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it would be premature to start trying to characterize what
we're seeing," said Rosa, the deputy director of operations for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.</TE>
<TE>   American forces have long focused on the region near the Pakistani
border and believe that pockets of Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters are holed
up there. But perceptions of what's happening shifts as the enemy moves
and new intelligence is received, defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Khowst region is a major land route into Pakistan to the east and
borders the area where U.S.-led troops just conducted the largest land
assault staged in the nearly 6-month-old campaign against Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Khowst is also saturated with weapons and has been the
site of hostilities between competing Afghan warlords.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa declined to answer questions about the number of enemy fighters
believed to be in the area or how they were communicating and operating.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's always worth repeating, we expect and anticipate additional
pockets of resistance," Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said. "It is
the MO of these people to try to regroup in some shape or fashion, so we
fully expect it, and that's one of the reasons we're still there."</TE>
<TE>   Rosa said that although there had been no engagements with enemy
fighters in more than a week, coalition pilots flew 150 mission over
Afghanistan on Monday and continued to search the area of the recently
completed Operation Anaconda, the large ground assault against other
regroupings of Al Qaeda and Taliban forces this month.</TE>
<TE>   The flights included reconnaissance planes, and bombers on standby in
case enemy forces are sighted.</TE>
<TE>   Zawahiri, 50, a personal physician to Bin Laden, was reportedly seen
about a week ago near the site of Operation Anaconda battles in
neighboring Paktia province.</TE>
<TE>   Commanders have said that they expect to encounter fighters in smaller
groups and that activity will increase as spring weather emerges and
troops on both sides can move around better.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa said coalition forces could face extra problems with smaller
enemy groupings.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you'd like to have them in one big cluster and be able to
mount an attack and do as much damage as you can," he said.</TE>

<HD>GOP Donors Lobbied Hard on Energy</HD>
<DH>Politics: Green groups, largely left out of the policy planning
process, say the documents show the Bush team favored industry interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A review of newly released government records shows that Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham, while working on the administration's national
energy plan, met with more industry officials than his aides had
previously reported.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the special interests that lobbied the administration while
the plan was being drafted were big campaign contributors to the
Republican Party.</LD>
<LD>   A day after the Energy Department and other agencies released 16,000
pages of records that had been sought under the Freedom of Information
Act, the legal and political fracas intensified over how much influence
industry lobbyists and campaign contributors wielded in shaping the
administration's energy policy.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists, who documents show did not get an audience with
Abraham, said the material supported their contention that the policy was
drawn up to favor the coal, gas, oil and nuclear industries.</TE>
<TE>   "The overwhelming evidence is that the Bush administration listened to
their campaign contributors when they weighed in with their wish lists of
policies," said Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global
warming and energy program.</TE>
<TE>   But White House spokesman Ari Fleischer responded that
environmentalists' views were included, citing a $3-billion provision to
promote hybrid fuel-cell vehicles, and he downplayed Abraham's meetings
with energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   "News flash: It's no surprise to anybody that the secretary of Energy
meets with energy-related groups," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The release of the documents did nothing to calm the debate over
whether the White House should have to identify individuals who met with
Vice President Dick Cheney and other task force members and to disclose
what was discussed in those meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Recent court rulings required only the Energy Department and other
agencies to release documents related to the task force, formally known
as the National Energy Policy Development Group.</TE>
<TE>   Because much of the information on the documents released Monday was
deleted, Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that had sued to
obtain the material, vowed to go back to court to make the administration
justify the omissions and explain why it withheld 15,000 additional
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations from government officials on policy options were
deleted from the documents, because, the Energy Department argues, they
are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act as part of the
"deliberative process."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups said they had requested meetings with Cheney and
Abraham and were turned down.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of those groups did meet a handful of times with
lower-ranking officials, including one large meeting April 4 with Andrew
Lundquist, the task force's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting with Lundquist merely gave the environmentalists time to
introduce themselves, Becker said. Lundquist then asked them to send
their ideas in writing.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrast that with the Exxons, Enrons and General Motors of the
world. They were consulted early, throughout and late--and got what they
wanted," said the Sierra Club's Becker.</TE>
<TE>   The documents show that Abraham met with more than the 36
representatives of business interests that his aides listed on an
attachment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Those meetings, held from Feb. 9 to May 10 of last year, included
groups such as the Nuclear Energy Institute, which has contributed
$436,154 to Republicans since 1999, and executives of Excelon Corp.,
which contributed $937,386, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham's own schedule shows at least 20 additional meetings with
lobbyists, oil and coal industry representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham met Feb. 21 with representatives of the American Petroleum
Institute and five oil companies, including the president of Anadarko
Petroleum, which has contributed $838,921 to the GOP since 1999, and the
president of Chevron Texaco, which has contributed more than $1.6 million
to the GOP since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In total, Abraham met with industry groups and lobbyists that have
contributed more than $17 million to politicians since 1999, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics. More than $12.6 million of that total
went to Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The documents indicate that key energy officials frequently sought
information from lobbyists and industry groups as they were preparing the
administration plan.</TE>
<TE>   There are several groups of e-mail volleys between Joseph T. Kelliher,
senior policy advisor and chief coordinator of the agency's efforts on
the energy plan, and lobbyists or representatives from various energy
industries. Kelliher was nominated in October as a member of the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Linda Stuntz, an energy lawyer and lobbyist and former
senior official in the first Bush administration's Energy Department,
e-mailed Kelliher on May 21, replying to his request for "concrete
examples" of states having trouble siting transmission lines.</TE>
<TE>   She offered a Southern California example--the Rainbow Valley Project,
which she said long had tried unsuccessfully to site 31 miles of
transmission lines connecting Romoland to San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what [Kelliher] was doing was asking us to be a resource,"
Stuntz said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Stuntz also reached out to Kelliher, whom she described as a personal
friend, to ensure that the energy plan made electricity grid standards
mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   Both issues were priorities for one of Stuntz's clients, the North
American Electric Reliability Council, which represents all public and
private utilities.</TE>

<HD>Condit Called Before Grand Jury</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The congressman has been subpoenaed to testify about
missing intern Chandra Levy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), whose reelection bid ended earlier
this month with a defeat in the California state primary, is getting no
rest from authorities probing the disappearance of former intern Chandra
Levy.</LD>
<LD>   Condit, who publicly has said only that he shared a "very close"
relationship with Levy, surrendered bank statements, phone records and
other materials from his congressional office under subpoena last fall.
Now he has been subpoenaed to testify before a Washington grand jury
within the next two weeks. News of the subpoena was first reported in the
Washington Post.</LD>
<LD>   His appearance will represent the first sworn testimony for the
six-term Central Valley lawmaker. Condit has been questioned repeatedly
by law enforcement officials since Levy disappeared last spring, but
never before under oath.</LD>
<TE>   Some legal analysts expressed surprise that he would be summoned to
testify at this late date, as District of Columbia police have said he is
not a suspect in the 24-year-old's disappearance. But one Washington
lawyer said that grand jurors may be focusing anew on the truthfulness of
earlier statements made by Condit or staff members to police and FBI
agents.</TE>
<TE>   "They may be trying to determine if anyone obstructed justice," said
the veteran attorney, who has followed the case closely. "Usually the
target of a grand jury is not subpoenaed, but who knows if the usual
rules apply to this case."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Condit nor his lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, offered comment.</TE>
<TE>   Among other matters, authorities have been looking into claims by
United Airlines flight attendant Anne Marie Smith that Condit asked her
to lie to investigators about a 10-month affair she says they had--thus
raising the question of whether Condit tried to obstruct the
investigation. Condit has challenged Smith's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents last summer interviewed former Condit staff members and
acquaintances in Washington, in Levy's hometown of Modesto and in other
parts of California--often asking more about Condit than about Levy.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also have been probing a witness' account that he saw
the congressman toss a watch case into a trash can in Alexandria, Va.,
hours before police searched his condominium several miles away on July
10. The watch case was recovered and was found to have been a gift to
Condit from a woman in San Francisco who was a member of his staff, an
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman has refused to detail in public his relationship with
Levy, a USC graduate student who disappeared after completing an
internship at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons here. Levy's family has said the
two were having an affair, and Condit reportedly has admitted as much to
police.</TE>
<TE>   In declining to name Condit as a suspect, authorities repeatedly have
said that they have found no evidence of foul play. Police officials,
however, publicly have complained that Condit has been less than
forthright in some of their meetings with him.</TE>
<TE>   D.C. Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey said recently that while "there
have been no new leads," there is "still a lot of information that's
being sorted through." Police and FBI agents have questioned thousands of
witnesses in Washington and California and searched wide areas of the
District of Columbia, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levy disappeared as she was preparing to return home to receive a
master's degree from USC. She was last seen April 30.</TE>

<HD>Justices Weigh Speech Ban in Judicial Races</HD>
<DH>Law: Supreme Court ponders whether states can bar candidates for
state judgeships from commenting on issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It sounded a bit strange from the start: an election contest in
which the candidates are barred from telling the voters what they think.</LD>
<LD>   And the more they considered the ban, the more it seemed
unconstitutional, a violation of the candidates' right to freedom of
speech.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court justices, all of whom are appointed, took a hard
look Tuesday at state elections for judges, and they spent much of the
hour voicing their view that states cannot prohibit candidates from
speaking their minds.</LD>
<TE>   "I am absolutely befuddled" by the no-comment rules for judicial
candidates, said Justice Antonin Scalia. "Minnesota wants its judges
elected. But then it prevents the electorate from knowing what the judges
believe. How does that make sense?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's an odd system," added Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. "And designed
for what? To protect incumbents?"</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota state attorney had a ready answer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's intended to protect the integrity of the judiciary," said Alan
Gilbert, Minnesota's solicitor general.</TE>
<TE>   The public wants judges who are fair and impartial, he said. Who would
want to go before a judge who has declared his strong views on the key
issue in the case during the last campaign, he asked.</TE>
<TE>   In 30 states, all or most judges are elected. And many of those
states, including California, enforce an ethics rule that forbids
judicial candidates to make "statements that commit or appear to commit
the candidate with respect to cases, controversies or issues that are
likely to come before the court."</TE>
<TE>   This long-standing rule is being challenged by the Republican Party of
Minnesota and Gregory Wersal, a three-time loser in races for the state
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Wersal said he was unable to identify himself as a Republican and
speak out on issues that would draw the support of conservatives. He was
represented Tuesday in the high court by attorney James Bopp Jr., the
general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1st Amendment has its more urgent application in election
contests," Bopp said. The voters "need information to make an informed
choice."</TE>
<TE>   The case has drawn wide attention because it comes at a time when
state judicial elections are becoming more costly and contentious.
Business groups poured millions of dollars into campaign ads two years
ago to defeat allegedly anti-business judges in Michigan, Ohio, Alabama
and Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Decrying this trend, the American Bar Assn. filed a brief in which it
argued that respect for the judiciary will be imperiled if campaigns for
the bench become overtly political. The ABA drew up the codes of conduct
for lawyers and judges that were at issue Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   When the ABA was mentioned during the argument, Scalia took a swipe at
the lawyer group.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the ABA's position on judicial elections?" Scalia asked Bopp.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not in favor of them," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think so," Scalia said.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear that he and most of his colleagues thought the state
could not both require competitive elections and restrict the candidates
from speaking out.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices spent considerable time puzzling over what is allowed
and what is not allowed under the current rules.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked whether a candidate could say
the state court was wrong to suppress evidence in many cases. "And if you
elect me as a judge, I'll take a different approach," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state lawyer said a candidate can criticize past rulings but
cannot say how he would rule "on future cases."</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist asked how that made sense. If a candidate says he will be
tougher on drug cases, the voters would assume his approach will affect
future cases, if he is elected.</TE>
<TE>   "So I can say, 'This is the worst decision since Dred Scot [the 1857
ruling that upheld a slave owner's rights in the free states of the
North]. It's a plague over the people. But I'm not telling you how I will
vote on the issue?' " said Justice Anthony Kennedy, mocking the state
lawyer's argument.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert conceded it was a fine line. Candidates can talk about their
judicial philosophy, but not cross the line to take specific stands on
controversial issues, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Wersal could say he was a 'strict constructionist' and opposed
'judicial activism,' " Gilbert said, two general views often voiced by
conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just fluff," Scalia snapped. "That's meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   Only Justice Stephen G. Breyer spoke up for the state's law, pointing
out that he had tried to draw the same fine line when he appeared before
the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1994, talking about judicial philosophy
while not explicitly taking stands on issues.</TE>
<TE>   The justices will issue a ruling by late June in the case of
Republican Party of Minnesota vs. Kelly, 01-521.</TE>

<LD>President Bush on Tuesday nominated an Algerian-born radiologist to
lead the National Institutes of Health, moving to fill a position that
was long vacant even while the ongoing bioterrorism threat added to its
importance.</LD>
<LD>   Bush chose Dr. Elias Adam Zerhouni, 50, to lead the NIH, the nation's
premier medical research institution with an annual budget of more than
$23 billion. The agency has been without a permanent director for more
than two years.</LD>
<LD>   Zerhouni arrived from Algeria at age 24, with $300 in his pocket and
little ability to speak English. Now, he is a top administrator at the
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, chief of its radiology
department and co-founder of a 15-person company that aims to create
better images of the inner workings of the body.</LD>
<TE>   "Dr. Zerhouni is well prepared to manage this rapidly growing
institution during times of great new opportunity and urgent biodefense
needs," Bush said Tuesday in announcing the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Zerhouni must be approved by the Democratic-led Senate. Although there
were few initial signs of opposition, some lawmakers and research groups
said they want to learn more about Zerhouni, particularly his views on
medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos, a politically
charged issue.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers said they were pleased that Bush had finally moved
to fill the slot, 14 months into his term.</TE>
<TE>   The NIH has been without a permanent director since the end of 1999,
leaving a leadership vacuum at a crucial time. At least five of the
agency's 19 major institutes lack directors, including those devoted to
neurological disorders, mental health and drug abuse. Agency insiders say
prominent scientists have been hesitant to commit to those jobs until the
top NIH slot is filled.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the NIH has received an unprecedented boost in
funding, as Congress completed a five-year plan to double its research
budget and the anthrax attacks last year prompted a major boost in
funding for bioterrorism research.</TE>
<TE>   Members of some patient groups and scientific associations have viewed
the delay in picking a nominee as a sign of how difficult it has become
to fill top government health jobs when abortion, stem cell research,
pressure from industry and patient advocacy groups and other divisive
issues are topics of debate.</TE>
<TE>   Still vacant after more than a year is the top job at the Food and
Drug Administration, an agency responsible for regulating goods that
represent 25 cents out of every dollar spent in the U.S. In addition, the
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is leaving
next month, with no successor waiting in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   The stem cell issue has been a particularly thorny one for the
president. A wide range of scientists, including many of those at the
NIH, believe that research using stem cells from human embryos could
yield cures for a variety of diseases. Many patient-advocacy groups want
the federal government to support the research aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's allies in conservative and antiabortion groups say the
research is tantamount to murder because it destroys human embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was able to navigate the issue last year when he faced a decision
on whether to approve federal funding for the research. He decided to
allow funding for experiments using cells already taken from embryos but
not for research that caused any new embryos to be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Zerhouni has not spoken directly about Bush's policy, which he would
be charged with carrying out. Also unclear are his views on a related
issue: whether to allow scientists to create human embryos through
cloning for their stem cells. Bush strongly opposes the cloning work.</TE>
<TE>   At Johns Hopkins, Zerhouni was the driving force behind the new
Institute for Cell Engineering, which is dedicated to basic research on
stem cells. When the institute was created last year with an anonymous
donation of $58.5 million, Zerhouni seemed to take an expansive view of
stem cell research. "We wanted this field to progress as unimpeded as
possible, because it may have a huge potential for all mankind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Johns Hopkins spokeswoman said Tuesday that studying cells from
human embryos "was certainly within the vision of the institute."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush signaled Tuesday that Zerhouni supports sharp limits on that
research. "Dr. Zerhouni shares my view that human life is precious and
should not be exploited or destroyed for the benefits of others," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer, in a briefing held before the
announcements, rejected the suggestion that a "litmus test" on abortion
and other issues was being applied to candidates. Still, he said: "You
should expect people who are going to be in these positions to support
the ideas that the president has, otherwise they might not be comfortable
serving in an administration."</TE>
<TE>   Even without a full understanding of Zerhouni's views, people on both
sides of the stem cell debate endorsed the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Van Etten, chief executive of the Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation International, a leader in the fight for federal stem cell
funding, declared himself "very pleased" and said Zerhouni would "carry
stem cell research forward."</TE>
<TE>   Deal Hudson, editor and publisher of Crisis, a Catholic magazine,
declared himself pleased by Zerhouni's selection.</TE>
<TE>   "The president was able to make a decision that satisfied more than
one group," said Hudson, who prefers a total ban on funds for embryonic
stem cell research but applauded the limits that Bush set.</TE>
<TE>   While any NIH nominee would be expected to support the president's
views on stem cell research, that person could have a big influence on
the pace of the research. In addition to setting research priorities, the
NIH director could prod companies that own stem cell lines to share them
more quickly with scientists, and on more favorable terms.</TE>
<TE>   Zerhouni, one of eight children, was born in Nedroma, a small mountain
town on French Algeria's western border. His father was a math and
physics teacher. Zerhouni earned his medical degree in Algiers.</TE>
<TE>   Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, is one of the nation's largest research
enterprises and wins more grant money from NIH than any other
institution. Zerhouni is executive vice dean of the medical school. He
also is co-founder of Surgi-Vision Inc., of Gaithersburg, Md., which is
trying to pioneer a new generation of magnetic resonance imaging
equipment.</TE>

<HD>Teenager Loses Foot in Hawaii Shark Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIHUE, Hawaii
</DL>
<LD>Strumming a ukulele in his hospital bed, 17-year-old Hoku Aki
described Tuesday how he ripped out a shark's eye to escape as it was
biting off his foot.</LD>
<LD>   Aki was attacked Monday while he was body boarding in murky water
about 150 yards off Brennecke's Beach in Kauai. Witnesses said the youth
was pulled underwater by the shark.</LD>
<LD>   "I tried to open the mouth and get it off of me; that didn't work,"
Aki said. "I grabbed the shark's eye and ripped it out and he let me go."</LD>
<TE>   The Kauai High School senior said he thought he was going to die. "I
opened my eyes and I could see the shark," Aki said. "It was tossing me
all over the place. I heard my leg break. I heard the bone snap."</TE>
<TE>   Another shark was sighted Tuesday in waters near where Aki lost his
foot, prompting officials to close beaches in the popular Poipu resort
area for another day.</TE>
<TE>   Two miles of beach will remain closed until at least noon today to
give the shark 24 hours to leave the area, said Ernest Moniz Jr., a
battalion chief with the Kauai Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   A rainstorm created the murky water conditions--the most conducive to
shark attack. Conditions were similar on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A nurse visiting from Colorado wrapped a towel around Aki's leg and
applied pressure to stop the bleeding, Kauai fire officials said.
Firefighters arrived and applied a tourniquet until paramedics took over.</TE>
<TE>   Aki thanked the nurse for "saving my life."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's attack was the second reported in Hawaii this year.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Clears Way for New Clean Air Standards</HD>
<DH>Pollution: EPA gets the go-ahead to implement stalled Clinton-era
rules. The agency says it will have a plan by summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday cleared the way for federal
officials to enforce toughened air standards after nearly five years of
vigorous legal opposition by the trucking industry and other business
groups.</LD>
<LD>   Rejecting arguments that the Clinton-era standards were enacted
arbitrarily, the court said the Environmental Protection Agency "must err
on the side of caution" in deciding what levels of smog, soot and other
pollutants are considered dangerous to the public.</LD>
<LD>   The EPA now plans to develop a proposal by the summer for implementing
the toughened clean air standards and identifying which states may fall
out of compliance in limiting pollutants.</LD>
<TE>   "The court has lifted the gate, given us the green light to go ahead
and implement this thing," said Dave Ryan, an EPA spokesman in
Washington. "This is a great victory for us."</TE>
<TE>   The EPA asserts that the clean air standards, first approved in 1997
under the Clinton administration, will prevent 15,000 premature deaths,
350,000 cases of asthma and 1 million cases of decreased lung function in
children.</TE>
<TE>New Rules Could Help Asthmatics</TE>
<TE>   While the expected implementation of the plan could mean limited
improvements to air quality in California, its biggest impact will likely
be felt in the Midwest and the Southeast, which are home to many larger
and older power plants that contribute to ozone smog, according to
Justice Department attorneys who defended the EPA plan.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA estimates that ozone smog caused by power plant pollution
triggers more than 600,000 asthma attacks each year.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 plan, based on thousands of new health studies, toughened the
standards for acceptable smog from cars, power plants and other sources,
and for the first time limited "fine particle" pollutants, including
airborne soot from sources such as diesel trucks and power plants. It
would limit ozone concentration levels to 0.08 parts per million during
an eight-hour period and limit soot particles to 65 micrograms per cubic
meter in a 24-hour period.</TE>
<TE>Trucking Groups Opposed New Standards</TE>
<TE>   The business community, led by the American Trucking Assns., the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and other groups, has attacked the plan from the
outset, triggering a protracted battle in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   The fight reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which issued a mixed verdict
last year that affirmed some broad portions of the plan but also sent
other parts back to the lower court for further review. That set the
stage for Tuesday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups, in a multi-pronged attack on the air standards,
argued that the EPA assumed overly broad authority that should have
rested with Congress, failed to consider the financial impact on
businesses that would be forced to use cleaner technology, denied the
public access to decision-making data and employed "arbitrary and
capricious" standards.</TE>
<TE>   But the Court of Appeals found Tuesday that the plan was reasonable
and that the EPA is not required to pinpoint exact levels at which
pollutants can harm the public.</TE>
<TE>   "EPA must err on the side of caution, just as it did here--setting the
[air quality standards] at whatever level it deems necessary and
sufficient to protect the public health with an adequate margin of
safety, taking into account both the available evidence and the
inevitable scientific uncertainties," the court said in a unanimous
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the American Trucking Assns. said they had not yet
reviewed the ruling and could not comment on whether they would continue
to fight the plan. Although narrow parts of the ruling could still be
appealed, environmental attorneys said they considered it unlikely
because key issues in the case have already gone before the Supreme
Court. And attorneys for the Justice Department and the EPA said that in
their view, the court on Tuesday had effectively rejected "all of the
remaining challenges" to the air quality plan.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some environmental groups predicted that the new standards
could be enforced within a year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge win for public health, because the industry has been
fighting this for five years," Howard Fox, managing attorney for
Earthjustice, an Oakland-based environmental group that helped litigate
the case, said in an interview. "The court is saying that you don't have
to wait to have dead bodies before you take precautionary steps to
protect the public."</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club said that because of the ruling, "children and people
suffering from asthma and other lung diseases will breathe a little
easier."</TE>
<TE>   And EPA Administrator Christie Whitman, who has often clashed with
environmentalists over the Bush administration's conservation policies,
agreed that the ruling was "a significant victory in EPA's ongoing
efforts to protect the health of millions of Americans from the dangers
of air pollution."</TE>
<TE>Limited Impact on California</TE>
<TE>   Environmental and business groups will be watching closely to see how
the EPA moves to implement the standards and how it assesses whether
states are in compliance.</TE>
<TE>   But early indications are that the new rules would have only a limited
impact on California because the state has often been ahead of the rest
of the nation in imposing tough air standards. States can impose more
restrictive standards than the federal government sets, but not more
lenient.</TE>
<TE>   "This is less significant for California than for other states because
the state already has tough standards," predicted one congressional aide
who has worked on the issue but asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "This could conceivably mean a little bit tighter standard, but not
out of line" with the state's current regulations, the aide said.</TE>

<HD>At Least 4 Die in Bus-Van Collision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IXONIA, Wis.
</DL>
<LD>A tour bus carrying residents of a retirement home collided head-on
with a delivery van Tuesday, killing at least four people and injuring 19
others, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-two people were aboard the bus, authorities said. The van,
which carried only the driver, burst into flames during the accident 30
miles west of Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   More than a dozen people were taken to area hospitals. At least four
were in critical condition.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no one that was not injured in this accident," Jefferson
County Sheriff's Capt. Kevin Stapleton said.</TE>
<TE>   Both drivers were among those killed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Leslie, 21, a clerk at a nearby gas station, was driving on a
highway behind the van and watched it turn left onto a county road. He
was about to follow when he saw flames--no van, just "fire and black
smoke."</TE>
<TE>   "And then through the flames came the bus and the bus slammed into the
ditch," he said. "I couldn't believe it. It was just so fast.</TE>
<TE>   "If I would have turned, I would have been there, right behind the
van."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie later helped take people off the bus. Some were unconscious and
one woman was seriously hurt. "Her face was bleeding pretty bad from her
nose," Leslie said. "She said her back and stomach hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Zinzendorf Hall, a retirement home in Watertown, chartered the bus to
take people to Milwaukee, said Ehren Bittorf, the manager of bus owner
Transportation Services of Watertown.</TE>

<HD>Social Security, Medicare Prognosis Is Upgraded</HD>
<DH>Economy: Despite recession, programs' financial health has
improved, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The financial health of Social Security and Medicare improved
slightly despite the recession, trustees reported Tuesday, but they
continued to urge reforms now to avoid severe benefit cuts and steep tax
hikes when the baby boomers retire.</LD>
<LD>   Congress, however, shows little inclination to grapple with either of
the programs this election year. "The trustees' reports don't add any new
sense of urgency," said economist Robert D. Reischauer, president of the
Urban Institute think tank. "The political and budget climates are
hostile to reforms and restructuring initiatives."</LD>
<LD>   Social Security Commissioner Jo Anne Barnhart, one of six trustees of
both programs, said the new numbers "suggest that we have not lost ground
in the past year."</LD>
<TE>   "However," she warned, "once the trust funds are exhausted, payroll
tax revenues will be sufficient to meet only 73% of Social Security
benefit obligations."</TE>
<TE>   The Social Security trust fund is now projected to be exhausted in
2041, which is three years later than in last year's report. Medicare's
hospital insurance trust fund is projected to remain solvent until 2030,
a one-year gain.</TE>
<TE>   The rising output of American workers is the chief reason that the
nation's two largest social programs are holding their own in a troubled
economy, said Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, also a trustee. Social
Security and Medicare are supported through payroll taxes levied on
workers and employers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really amazing, the 5.2% rate of productivity growth in the
fourth quarter [of 2001] in the midst of an economic slowdown," O'Neill
said. Growth in productivity is not a transitory phenomenon, he said, but
a long-term trend. O'Neill suggested that productivity estimates may be
raised again next year.</TE>
<TE>   But he quickly added: "Productivity will not solve the size of the
problem one finds in Social Security and Medicare."</TE>
<TE>   Reischauer said that Social Security's estimators were probably overly
conservative in previous years in assessing productivity growth. While it
is tempting to think that the economy could grow its way out of the
projected insolvency of Social Security and Medicare, Reischauer said it
is also highly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of other uncertainties, not the least of which are
the medical advances that come with the genetics revolution and could add
substantially to Medicare costs--and lengthen life spans," he said.
"Social Security and Medicare costs could turn out to be larger than the
actuaries are estimating."</TE>
<TE>   The crunch in both programs will start to make itself felt in a little
over a decade, the trustees predicted.</TE>
<TE>   In 2016, Medicare payroll tax collections will no longer be sufficient
to pay for that year's hospital benefits, projections say. The program
will have to start drawing down its trust fund, a special government
account that amounts to an IOU backed by the taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Social Security will have to begin dipping into its trust fund a year
later.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said tackling
reform now would help both beneficiaries and taxpayers because it would
allow potentially painful changes to be made more gradually.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Social Security is going to be very difficult in an election
year, but I don't think the same holds true for Medicare," Thompson said.
"I'm one of a real minority [that believes] this is an opportunity for us
to do something about Medicare."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and Democrats in Congress have offered competing
proposals to add outpatient prescription drug coverage to Medicare. While
Bush would also like to address the long-term solvency of the program,
Democrats are more inclined to focus on improving a benefits package that
in some respects dates back to the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The number of elderly Americans is expected to double by 2030.
Currently, for every Medicare beneficiary, there are four workers paying
payroll taxes. By 2076, there will only be about two workers for every
beneficiary.</TE>

as part of an investigation into whether he and a friend were involved in
a plot to carry out a suicide attack in Israel, federal authorities
disclosed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Osman Idris, 24, of Annandale, Va., was secretly charged last
week with one felony count of lying to a federal grand jury. According to
a complaint and a detailed FBI affidavit unsealed Tuesday, Idris and a
companion were traveling to Israel when they left behind a letter that
allegedly described the friend's intention to commit jihad, or holy war.</LD>
<LD>   FBI officials allege that Idris lied repeatedly when he swore under
oath--while answering questions about other suspicious activities--that
he had never discussed jihad.</LD>
<TE>   The grand jury has been convened by the U.S. attorney's office in
Alexandria, Va., to investigate terrorism plots in the U.S. and abroad.
The affidavit describes how the investigation has been monitored by the
Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect Idris and the man carrying the letter, Mohammed
El-Yacoubi of Fairfax, Va., of providing or attempting to provide
material support to Hamas, Islamic Jihad "and/or other international
terrorists," according to the affidavit. They declined to discuss details
of the case, including other potential suspects.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Idris said his client maintains his innocence. Idris is a
former student at Virginia's George Mason University who intends to
resume his studies, and is a victim of overzealous counter-terrorism
investigators, lawyer Thomas Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is speculating on what they think these guys were
doing," Walsh said after a brief court appearance on Idris' behalf.
"There is nothing there except that witnesses [the FBI] interviewed think
that these people have certain beliefs, i.e., that suicide bombings are
justified."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement authorities said Idris was released on bond
and that El-Yacoubi also was not in custody. They declined to discuss
details of the case, citing the ongoing criminal investigation into the
two men's activities.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say with any certainty what these guys were up to or might
have been up to. We don't know," said one Justice Department official.
"All we have is the letter. At this point it is simply a charge of lying
to a grand jury."</TE>
<TE>   Several federal law enforcement officials said the allegedly
suspicious activities include a trip the two men took together to Israel
last December after months of complaining to friends that Israel and Jews
in general were responsible for much of society's problems. Both men also
sought new passports after deciding that prior trips to Saudi Arabia
might draw the suspicion of Israeli authorities and prevent them from
gaining entry into the country, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The officials cited Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's frequently stated
decree that he would rather thwart terrorist plots in their early stages
by taking suspicious people into custody, rather than continue to gather
evidence against them that could be used to prosecute them on terrorism
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Idris and El-Yacoubi are childhood friends who traveled together to
Israel on Dec. 13, five days after El-Yacoubi visited his younger brother
at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, the affidavit by FBI
Special Agent John V. Wyman said. El-Yacoubi brought with him a letter
from his brother, written in Arabic, but in his haste left it behind at
John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had stopped the two men but allowed them to board an El
Al flight to Israel. But Israeli authorities denied the men entry,
forcing their return to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI recovered the four-page letter and had it translated. Wyman
described the letter in the affidavit as a farewell missive from the
younger El-Yacoubi acknowledging his older brother's plans to kill
himself and become a martyr in the eyes of Allah.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard what you are going to carry out, my heart was filled
with the feeling of grief and joy because you are the closest human being
to my heart," the younger brother wrote, according to the FBI
translation. "It is incumbent upon me to encourage you and help you,
because Islam urges Jihad for the sake of Allah. . . . You will, by your
action, give honor to our family."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, Idris and both El-Yacoubi brothers denied that there
was any plot to commit a terrorist act, and that the younger El-Yacoubi
was simply worried that his brother was traveling to a dangerous place.</TE>
<TE>   But a host of FBI translators and counter-terrorism experts believe
the letter and subsequent interviews with the three men and their friends
clearly indicate that a suicide plot was imminent had the two men been
given entry to Israel, Wyman wrote in his affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   "The references to jihad in an overwhelmingly violent context cannot
be confused with a letter written to someone traveling to Israel solely
for the purpose of sightseeing or praying," Wyman wrote. "The overall
tone of the letter clearly implies the use of violence and/or loss of
life."</TE>
<TE>   The pair also was carrying $2,000 in cash, a cellular telephone, a
compass, calculator and video camera, Wyman wrote.</TE>

<HD>GOP Official's Comment on Women Criticized</HD>

<DL>LANSING, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>Republican national committeeman Chuck Yob said he will not resign
after saying women running for statewide elective office are best suited
for secretary of state because "they like that kind of work."</LD>
<LD>   Two Republican candidates for Michigan governor, Lt. Gov. Dick
Posthumus and state Sen. John Schwarz of Battle Creek, called for Yob to
step down.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately, because of his role as national committeeman, his
comments will serve only to distract from what is an otherwise compelling
record by the GOP on behalf of women," Posthumus said Monday in a
statement.</LD>
<TE>   "It is best for the party that we make this change and move on,"
Schwarz said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, GOP Gov. John Engler said he supports the call for Yob's
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Yob, 65, rejected their suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   "Under no circumstances will I resign my position as national
committeeman. I was elected by our party's grass roots, not its elected
officials," he said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Yob said he still backs Posthumus' gubernatorial bid.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still a strong supporter of the lieutenant governor," Yob said.
"But we probably won't be as chummy as we've been."</TE>
<TE>   During a taping of the Michigan public affairs program "Off the
Record," Yob said secretary of state is a good job for a woman.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a real nice place on the ticket for a woman. They like that
kind of work," he said. "Most county clerks across the state, which is a
jump to [secretary of state], are women and they have the experience."</TE>
<TE>   He had been asked about gender balance on the GOP's November ballot,
and said the GOP had a very good female candidate for secretary of state
in former Kent County Clerk Terri Land.</TE>
<TE>   He later said he did not intend to imply that women were qualified or
interested in only certain types of elected offices.</TE>
<TE>   The comment caused a furor among women. Moderate Republican state Rep.
Judith Scranton said it set back women's efforts to expand their role in
the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so offended that a national committeeman is so prejudiced
today," she said. "Shame on him."</TE>
<TE>   Another Republican gubernatorial candidate, businessman Ed Hamilton,
said Schwarz and Posthumus were caving in to pressure from liberal
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 80% of men slip into that kind of talk, but that doesn't mean
we don't support women's issues," Hamilton said Tuesday.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A National Academy of Sciences report released Tuesday recommends
the Interior Department take a "hands-off" approach to managing wildlife
and wild lands in Yellowstone National Park--particularly when it comes
to grazing elk.</LD>
<LD>   Yellowstone is home to wolves, bison and North America's largest elk
herd. For 80 years, there has been ongoing debate about whether the elk
are overgrazing the park's key plant species, such as willow, sagebrush
and aspen.</LD>
<LD>   Some have suggested thinning the elk herd to protect plants, while
others want to maintain the size of the elk herd, a prime food source for
wolves in the park.</LD>
<TE>   The National Academy of Sciences report has been anticipated as a
benchmark in that debate, with implications on whether the National Park
Service will alter its management policies.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the report suggests that park managers intervene as little
as possible in the park's ecosystem. It is a policy the park has
historically adhered to.</TE>
<TE>   "If the park decides that it needs to intervene to enhance declining
species like aspen, the smaller the intervention, the less likely it is
to do unintended damage," the report concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the report suggests that preying wolves may reduce the size
of the elk herd, which may decrease grazing pressure and allow more aspen
to survive the grazing elk.</TE>
<TE>   Yellowstone National Park Supt. Suzanne Lewis welcomed the findings,
which she said include opinions from the "highest scientific court of the
land."</TE>
<TE>   The report, compiled by the Academy's National Research Council, came
at the order of Congress. It noted that grazing herds, both of elk and of
bison, and the impact of that grazing, have been part of Yellowstone's
ecosystem for generations.</TE>

misstated the number as six. In the same column, the dates for the EAT'M

May 29, 30 and 31.</LD>
