<HD>Sharpton, Others to Discuss 'Barbershop' Plans</HD>

<LD>The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of several black leaders who have sharply
criticized the hit film "Barbershop" for poking fun at civil rights
icons Rosa Parks, the Rev. Martin Luther King and Jesse Jackson, said
Friday he and several other prominent leaders would discuss today
whether they will call for a boycott or other action against the
film.</LD>
<LD>   Sharpton made the statement after receiving a letter from Michael
G. Nathanson, the president of MGM, which produced and released the
low-budget comedy, which has been No. 1 at the box office for the
last two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Nathanson in his letter repeated his studio's previous statement
that he, the studio and the filmmakers had not intended to offend
anyone. "We have great regard for your opinions and hope that our
disagreement over this film does not detract from our shared
commitment to equal opportunity, fairness and justice," the letter
said.</LD>
<TE>   Sharpton said the letter does not address his demand that the
criticized scene, in which an older barber played by Cedric the
Entertainer makes less-than-reverent statements about King, Parks and
Jackson, be removed from the film when it is released on home video.
The barber is repeatedly shouted down by the other occupants of the
establishment during his tirade.</TE>
<TE>   "We can still hurt this film with a boycott," said Sharpton. "If
we can stop two out of 10 moviegoers, that will affect the bottom
line." He also said the studio's refusal to alter the film could have
a "long-range effect," saying he could push for action against future
MGM projects.</TE>
<TE>   The leader added he had received support in his protest from
several people across the country who resented the "vehemence" in
which the studio and filmmakers have defended their right to make
jokes about the civil rights pioneers.</TE>

<HD>The Serious Business of Partying</HD>
<DH>Nightlife* Seeking more respect within the business world,
the nightclub industry is holding its first convention, billed as a
four-day 'bender.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can America's party people handle this? The nightclub industry is
trying to get serious.</LD>
<LD>   Well, maybe just a little. The first ever nightclub convention
gets underway Sunday in New York City with veteran clubland
professionals at the helm. The hippest of the hip are leading
industry panels, the coolest of the cool are hosting unforgettable
bashes and party professionals from San Francisco to Miami are
attending.</LD>
<LD>   ClubNation, as the nightclub summit of 5,000 nightclub owners,
promoters and performers is called, promises to be a
"four-day-and-night bender" of discussions, exhibitions, talent
showcases and competitions and--what else?--parties, says publicist
Ronald Alan of Spin Control in New York. But, looking beyond the
bender, organizers are hoping ClubNation becomes an annual forum for
the nation's nightclub community as well as a strong signal to
politicians that the nightlife industry should be treated as big
business.</LD>
<TE>   "Clubs in America generate enormous tax revenues, and a big part
of ClubNation is a political wake-up call for people in this industry
to be counted. This aspect of the convention is going to be very
serious, but considering the audience, it's unconventional," says
Alan, referring to the 3 p.m. start time for the panels, which will
deal with everything from the economics of running a club to how to
handle club-goers at the door. "People will need to recover in the
mornings," he says. "The parties will go on all night."</TE>
<TE>   There will be no time for recuperating for club maven Chi Chi
Valenti, a 20-year veteran of Manhattan clubbing and frequent
mistress of ceremonies around town. Valenti is moderating all eight
daytime panels, which feature, among other topics, club security and
talent searching. She also is producing the Bartender's Ball--the
convention's eccentric signature party--which will re-create downtown
New York's decadent dives of more than a century ago and feature an
all-star Patricia Field fashion show and a special spinning
performance by internationally known DJ Louis Osbourne, son of rock
star Ozzy Osbourne.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Osbourne, a product of his father's first
marriage, began his career in Birmingham, England, eight years ago.
For the last three years, he has been touring the world with his
hypnotic house, techno and tribal music, hitting 24 American cities
in the process. Even though he is a part of MTV's most famous family
and his turntables have spun in clubs on all continents, Osbourne
expects Monday night's gig to mark his official arrival in the
country he wants to conquer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have a good party," says Osbourne, who temporarily
lives in Los Angeles and could easily compete with his famous dad for
the number of obscene words uttered per sentence. "Even though I've
been doing this for years, it's a very good showcase for me. This
ClubNation thing, it's pretty huge."</TE>
<TE>   ClubNation is the creation of Martin Codd, a New York City
impresario and director of special events at Webster Hall, the
convention's venue in Greenwich Village and scene of the city's
outrageous "Artists and Models" balls 100 years ago. Parties and
panels aside, the convention will also feature nearly 100 vendors
demonstrating goods and services that nightclubs use, Codd said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bar industry is so word-of-mouth," said Bryan Boettger,
marketing manager of Three Deep, a San Francisco company that sells a
digital bar beverage inventory system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredibly tough market. Not only do they not have office
hours, but in many instances, club owners don't even have offices.
With the credibility that the people in charge of this have, this is
the perfect opportunity for us to come show off our product."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that 600 million Americans go to 10,000 clubs every year,
Codd hopes his "unconvention" demonstrates how vital the industry is
for the overall economic health of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to showcase what nightlife is all about, in its full 360
degrees," Codd said. "There's such a wonderful variety of nightlife
in this country, whether it's a beach bar in Miami or a rock 'n' roll
club in Los Angeles or an outdoor venue in Dallas."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the timing of ClubNation is important, according to
panel moderator Valenti, because New York City, especially, is going
through an anti-nightclub period that began with former Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani's administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I can think of no time when nightclubs have been less well looked
upon," she says. "ClubNation is going to show ... that there's a lot
of tradition in terms of art, fashion and performers that comes out
of clubs. It's time for people to move away from thinking that
nightclubs are just big Ecstasy supermarkets."</TE>
<TE>   Codd said that someone like Valenti, who has held every nightclub
role, from door person to promoter to owner, was needed to moderate
the panel discussions, especially the ones made up of noted nightclub
owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect the panels to be almost as fun as the parties," Valenti
said. "Can you imagine a panel with the original Studio 54 doorman to
the door lady of a predominantly lesbian club to the people who do
the doors at the trendy places? We're going to get to the bottom of
how a door person mixes bodies to create ambience and the perfect
party."</TE>
<TE>   Another way nightclubs create mood these days is by hiring
performers to dance in the background or in the forefront, depending
on the scene the club owner envisions.</TE>
<TE>   On opening night, four go-go dance teams from clubs in Miami,
Philadelphia, Las Vegas and San Francisco will vie for the Club-
Nation championship title.</TE>
<TE>   ClubNation will culminate with a mega-party that includes the
Golden Turntable DJ Awards, which Alan calls "the Academy Awards of
Dance Music."</TE>
<TE>   "This convention is not for the fainthearted," Codd added.</TE>

<HD>A Subversive Clown Uses Lies to Get at the Truth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMORY HOLMES II</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new hit film "Barbershop" has upset a lot of people, in
particular one scene in which a highly opinionated and generally
misinformed barber named Eddie (played by comedian Cedric the
Entertainer) shocks everyone in the barbershop with his demeaning
commentaries on revered African American leaders, among them Rosa
Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.</LD>
<LD>   The immediate, outraged and varied responses Eddie provokes in the
movie's fictional Chicago barbershop echo the immediate, varied and
outraged responses that his remarks have provoked on the national
stage.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, I will wager, the offending scene is today being echoed
in conversations in barbershops (and other communal venues) around
the country--each of them no doubt addressing in earnest detail the
truth or falsity of those statements spoken in ignorance or jest by
Eddie. This is what a film is supposed to do: imitate life through an
artful weave of falsity.</LD>
<TE>   Ironically, if "Barbershop" was a worse film, there might not be
this debate. In a lesser film, Eddie would have been duly vanquished
in a cutting contest with a trash talker with more formidable skills
than his; or if the film was forgettable, its excesses would dribble
into obscurity below our cultural radar.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the case with "Barbershop" or with the curiously
subversive Eddie. His voice is the most strident and shocking in the
film--and in some ways, the truest. As my friend Rose used to tell
me, "Even the devil has to tell the truth sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie is a bug-eyed, elderly gentleman with big colorful hair, big
clothes, big features and a big smart mouth--in other words, he's a
clown. Eddie's blunders and offenses against truth and decorum, too,
are huge and clownish. Students of African American history, and this
includes the film's sharpest critics, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the
Rev. Al Sharpton, and lots of baby boomers like me, have seen this
character before. I myself have even been him from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   In African American lore, this character is known as the
trickster--a Brer Rabbit, an inveterate liar and a self-referential
fool. His lies and foolishness are the seats of his wisdom and the
engines of his mischief.</TE>
<TE>   The clientele at a place like Calvin's Barbershop, the mythical
place where the drama unfolds, would know him as a trash talker and a
liar. The things that come out of his mouth are meant to stir things
up and foment debate. He is a fool, and a comic foil, and therefore
everything he says and does is a lie or partakes of a lie.</TE>
<TE>   When Eddie enters the film, he is pretending to be someone he is
not: He cons a couple of gullible customers into fearing that he is a
robber and a thug. At the last moment, he throws off his disguise,
and everyone enjoys a laugh at the fooled customers' expense.</TE>
<TE>   Each of Eddie's actions and speeches, composed of half-truths,
malapropisms, folk wisdom and outright lies, provokes some form of
spirited engagement from someone in the shop.</TE>
<TE>   They are supposed to do the same for us as well. They are a
species of verbal graffiti scrawled along the base of Mrs. Parks'
inviolate monument.</TE>
<TE>   Before I ever heard of Rosa Parks, Dr. King, or any of the living
and martyred saints of the civil rights movement, my grandmother was
the apex of morality and power in my world. She took me by the hand
and down the steep slopes of Woods Street in Nashville where we lived
and into the Negro barbershop on 8th Avenue to get a cut.</TE>
<TE>   But if we were approached by a white person of any age or gender,
we were expected to step into the street so that the white person
could pass on the pavement. My grandmother, a strong, proud woman,
quietly obliged this racist system, as did millions of other African
American Southerners.</TE>
<TE>   When we got on a bus, she could not just sit down, as Eddie
suggests was so easy for Mrs. Parks to do. My grandfather had been
murdered by whites for exactly such a slight. And so when Mrs. Parks
sat down, it was a seismic shift, which my grandmother and I and all
my family and neighbors benefited from that moment forward.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of protest used to be necessary. When our family went to
the movies in Nashville in the early '50s, our parents would dress us
as if we were going to a formal event, my sisters in their Sunday
dresses, and me in my blazer, bow tie and pint-size fedora. Before
the activism of everyday local people like my folks or epic regional
figures like Mrs. Parks, none us ever dared enter the theaters by the
front doors.</TE>
<TE>   We understood this fact and never crossed the invisible Jim Crow
barriers that proscribed our every step.</TE>
<TE>   Our survival required that we never let the white folks know what
we were thinking and plotting behind our smiling masks. We would join
the streams of Negroes--doctors, workers, students--circling around
the theater to its foul back alley, where we mounted a spindly flight
of stairs leading to the second-floor balcony where the Negro movie
section awaited.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing can destroy the dignity of those folks to me, not the
monstrous excesses of white folks, and certainly not a movie.</TE>

<KH>The Fall Season</KH>
<HD>Dancing to a Different Beat</HD>
<DH>New NBC series feature 'Bandstand' wannabes in a turbulent
era and a 'Rashomon'-like look at crime fighting in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nostalgia and crime--prominent themes in the season's new
series--recur in a pair of dramas arriving Sunday on NBC.</LD>
<LD>   Tender but laborious, "American Dreams" opens in 1963 with the
happy feet of Philadelphia's "American Bandstand" leading eventually
to a somber funeral cortege for JFK after Dallas. Later that evening
comes "Boomtown," a stylish, high-sheen, entertaining crime-fighting
hour told from the different perspectives of its Los Angeles
characters.</LD>
<LD>   At least the giggly, self-obsessed teenagers of "American Dreams"
look and act their ages compared with the mid-20ish actors in other
new series tilted toward adolescence.</LD>
<TE>   In "American Dreams," Meg (Brittany Snow) and her daring best
friend, Roxanne (Vanessa Lengies), are not only typically boy crazy
but breathlessly gaga over "American Bandstand." That was Dick
Clark's signature pop music series that began on TV as an adored
local show in the medium's infancy before going national in 1957 and
helping solidify America's growing youth culture around music. Not
content with just watching it, these devoted 15-year-olds dream of
dancing on the show themselves, and Meg "can't imagine anything I'll
do that's so important." Kids. Go figure.</TE>
<TE>   As a drum roll for the era's cultural turbulence builds, Meg's
unfulfilled mother (Gail O'Grady) reads Mary McCarthy's novel "The
Group" and ponders life beyond matriarchy and stultifying deference
to her husband (Tom Verica), a solid family man and appliance store
owner whose rigid attitudes soon will be as obsolete as the
black-and-white TV sets he sells.</TE>
<TE>   He feels the full brunt, finding inexplicable the changes rocking
his traditional Catholic household: notably Meg's defiance, his son
(Will Estes) wanting to abort a celebrated high school football
career expected to land him at Notre Dame, and his wife meekly
announcing she wants no more children.</TE>
<TE>   "When did my dream become not enough?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "American Dreams"--and its pit stops with Clark (an executive
here, and woven into music scenes via old kinescopes)--are themselves
not quite enough. Initial episodes note such relevant signposts as
class conflict and racism (racially integrated "American Bandstand"
delivered its own influential message in that regard), then swiftly
rock 'n' roll on. A sense of period emerges faintly, but much of it
is surface, its tone syrupy, its impact fleeting. And after a while,
hair-flipping bandstanders Meg and Roxanne are nothing if not cloying
as they stumble toward maturity.</TE>
<TE>   Meaty, no. Yet "Boomtown," on the other hand, is nothing if not
highly watchable, a prerequisite for survival against ABC's "The
Practice," which resumes Sunday with an especially strong episode of
its own.</TE>
<TE>   As in CBS' new "Robbery Homicide Division," co-starring here are
L.A.'s urban sprawl and its distinctive personality tics, some
endearing, some maddening.</TE>
<TE>   Think Akira Kurosawa's classic "Rashomon"--projecting different
views of the same truth--and you have something approaching the
engrossing style of "Boomtown's" self-contained episodes about
violent crime that in coming hours include a fatal shooting arising
from sex games and a murderous defense attorney trying to save his
own skin.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing distinctive about the murders fueling Sunday's
premiere, which begins with a pair of young girls being gunned down
in a drive-by. Holding your attention is how the investigation is
depicted, by juggling time and peeling back the hours from the
viewpoints of the perpetrators and these regulars:</TE>
<TE>   A pair of detectives (Donnie Wahlberg and Mykelti Williamson), two
uniformed officers (Gary Basaraba and Jason Gedrick), a deputy
district attorney (Neal McDonough), a newspaper reporter (Nina
Garbiras) and a paramedic (Lana Parrilla).</TE>
<TE>   The premiere is especially moving when relating a young fugitive's
post-mortem, but there's an affecting back story, as well, for
Wahlberg's Det. Joel Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   "Boomtown" is no LAPD whitewash, by the way. Though he's a
straight arrow, Ray Hechler (Basaraba) employs questionable tactics
when he plants evidence in a future episode and, on Sunday, endangers
the innocent when he recklessly rams and flips a pick-up truck during
a high-speed chase through a residential area.</TE>
<TE>   If that happened in the real L.A., Hechler would be an instant
headline. As would married Deputy D.A. David McNorris (McDonough) for
publicly grabbing aggressive print reporter Andrea Little (Garbiras)
for a quickie smooch, which he does in a future episode. As would
Little, moreover, if anyone discovered she was sleeping with this
public official whose court cases she covers as part of her beat.</TE>
<TE>   In a more refreshing fantasy, "Boomtown's" L.A. appears to be
almost a one-medium town. In early episodes, at least, there are no
local TV pests to harass Little and her publication, who have the
news all to themselves. Which is one more reason why some of us think
so highly of this series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "American Dreams" will be shown Sundays at 8 p.m. on NBC. The
network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>
<TE>   "Boomtown" will be shown Sundays at 10 p.m. on NBC. The network
has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under the age of
14).</TE>

<LD>Very Friendly Skies: "Virgin Airways announced [recently that it has]
eliminated the baby-changing tables in the lavatories. They were
being used by passengers to have sex during flights. If this is a
problem on Virgin, you can imagine what it's like on United." (Argus
Hamilton)</LD>
<LD>   In the Air: "Singapore Airlines now features seats that fold out
to become beds. You can actually lie down and sleep on the flight.
That's an improvement. Now when the flight attendant rolls the
beverage carts down the aisle, instead of just smashing a knee,
they'll split your head open." (Jay Leno)</LD>
<LD>   On the Edge: "Scientists say that the coast of California is
eroding at two inches per year. They noticed when the last guy in

<LD>Prominent Jews in Hollywood pay $10,000 in blood money to hear
Benjamin Netanyahu spout a message that can best be summed up as
"Kill 'em all." And then they wonder how they can better market
Israel to America ("In Hollywood, a Small Break in the Silence on
Israel," by Rachel Abramowitz, Sept. 25).</LD>
<LD>   When will these people realize that the best thing they can do for
Israel is to show how [Ariel] Sharon and Hamas make each other
possible and probable? As long as Israelis run a de facto apartheid
system, Palestinian extremists will attack them and democratic voices
in Palestine will be silenced.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, only prominent Jews in Hollywood can afford to say
these things to an Israel they profess to love. Why? Because a
non-Jew would immediately be called anti-Semitic and put on a
blacklist every bit as severe as the one 50 years ago.</LD>

<TE>   Rachel Abramowitz quotes a Hollywood producer as saying there
would be "an outpouring" of support if Iraq were to attack Israel. I
have news for him: It would be too little, too late. Israel is under
attack now, and Iraq has played a part in keeping the fires burning.</TE>
<TE>   The media in the Muslim world and in Europe have spared no effort
to minimize Israel's suffering and to excuse murder of civilians by
the Palestinian terror groups. The silence from Hollywood's
mega-millionaires has been deafening.</TE>

nor to dictate politics. This is not a time for us to divide
ourselves and pit Jew against Jew. This is a time for solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   This is a time when Hollywood could produce films that educate and
teach tolerance while supporting whatever democratically elected
leader is running the government during a crucial time. The silence
of Hollywood is deafening. This is the time to put your money where
your heart is.</TE>

<LD>The only thing sour about Francois Ozon's "8 Women" is Manohla
Dargis' Sept. 20 review, "Sour '8 Women' Needs a Dash of Douglas
Sirk."</LD>
<LD>   "8 Women" is a silly, well-made mongrel of a film that is a bit
uneven and highly unconventional but nonetheless succeeds in
providing a very fun venue to see France's greatest actresses
singing, dancing and cat-fighting.</LD>
<LD>   Here is a refreshing bubble bath of a film that Dargis, dressed in
her scuba gear as film critic, dives into expecting great depths and
hits her head. A bubble bath is not that deep, Manohla, and a bonbon
like "8 Women," is not sour.</LD>

<TE>   I am disgusted that Kenneth Turan seems to have bought into the
kind of mindless, politically correct group-think that says movies
like "Trapped" (" 'Trapped: That's Exactly How You'll Feel," Sept.
23) shouldn't be produced because some people find films with such
dark subject matter upsetting or because the picture's release date
seems to coincide with troubling current events, such as the rash of
child kidnappings supposedly sweeping the country.</TE>
<TE>   Gosh, should studios stop making films about bad cops because of
Rampart? Should there be no more movies about rogue soldiers, since
we're at war and they might upset someone? Or do only movies about
cute children count?</TE>
<TE>   How about this: If a reviewer hates a film, he should hate it
strictly because it fails in its ambitions, basing his comments on
how well it handles its subject matter, not on the subject matter
itself.</TE>

<LD>CleanFlicks and companies like it have stepped in to fill a void the
movie industry has steadfastly refused to acknowledge ("Who Can Edit
a Movie? Directors Guild Files Suit," by Bob Baker, Sept. 21). A very
viable market exists of families who love movies but cannot in good
conscience bring those movies into their homes without some sort of
sanitizing.</LD>
<LD>   It's precisely because the movie industry hasn't acknowledged the
needs of this market that CleanFlicks has become so successful.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the DGA is rightly concerned about control of
copyrighted material, Martha Coolidge should be promoting a more
proactive approach. Her complaint that CleanFlicks profits "by the
commerce of these grossly altered products" would be assuaged if they
formed a partnership. Why not provide CleanFlicks with authorized
"family-friendly" versions for distribution?</LD>
<TE>   This way everyone wins: Families get appropriate movies, directors
retain copyright control and revenue and CleanFlicks becomes a
distributor in the market it has already been serving.</TE>

<LD>I was shocked at your package on tailgating parties ("Big Game? Sure,

students at these parties.</LD>
<LD>   Did you know the drinking age in California is 21? I am incensed
by your paper's making it appear so "cool" to get loaded for a
football game. It is also frightening to think these people are on

<DL></DL>
<LD>In response to the issue of the Beastie Boys' use of sampling the
musical sound from composer-flutist James Newton's recorded
composition "Choir" ("A Musician Writes It, a Rapper Borrows It; A
Swap or a Threat?" by Geoff Boucher, Sept. 21), Beastie Boys member
Adam Yauch misses the point when he states, "What we used is three
notes and three notes do not constitute a composition."</LD>
<LD>   It is not the three notes that they used, it is the unmistakable
sound of those three notes of James Newton in both his performance
and composition.</LD>
<LD>   If the Beastie Boys wanted three notes, they could have hired any
composer to compose them and any flutist to record them. The Beastie
Boys did not want any three notes. They wanted Newton's sound in his
composition "Choir," because that is what they liked.</LD>

<LD>   If his ability to continue his largess is now curtailed because of

<DL></DL>
<LD>World events keep conspiring to make Michael Frayn's "Copenhagen"
ever more timely.</LD>
<LD>   A meditation on a real-life meeting between two physicists whose
insights helped lay the groundwork for the atomic bomb, Frayn's story
ponders the ways in which people behave like atoms, capable of
colliding and setting off chain reactions. The physicists'
reaction--a misunderstanding that explosively
self-perpetuates--becomes a symbol of the sort of global discord that
currently dominates headlines.</LD>
<LD>   As a stage drama, "Copenhagen" has been a hit in London, New York
and Los Angeles. Sunday at 9 p.m., it arrives on television in a PBS
presentation adapted and directed by Howard Davies and performed by
Stephen Rea, Daniel Craig and Francesca Annis.</LD>
<TE>   The transition between mediums hits a few rough patches but,
overall, works fascinatingly well.</TE>
<TE>   Frayn sets his story in the afterlife, as Danish physicist Niels
Bohr and his wife, Margrethe, meet with German physicist Werner
Heisenberg to try to hash out why Heisenberg paid a visit to the
Bohrs in occupied Copenhagen in 1941. Had the meeting turned out
differently, Frayn suggests, Nazi Germany might have taken the lead
in developing the atomic bomb, and modern history would bear little
resemblance to what it does today.</TE>
<TE>   The stage presentation, directed by Michael Blakemore, was set in
a celestial lecture hall where the three characters circled one
another like atomic particles. Davies' television version depicts a
ghostly meeting in the Bohrs' now-abandoned home.</TE>
<TE>   Discussion among the ghosts takes place in empty rooms flooded
with white sunlight. Re-creations of the 1941 meeting unfold in the
house as it was vibrantly furnished back then--a sumptuousness that
calls to mind any number of "Masterpiece Theatre" presentations.</TE>
<TE>   The circling movements--the most inspired part of the stage
presentation--have been largely abandoned, although the same effect
is infrequently achieved by having the camera orbit around each
performer.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first half, events unfold with too much of a stately
sameness. But patience is rewarded as the presentation builds toward
a gripping, artful conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Rea's Bohr keeps his guest at arm's length, wary of this protege
who ended up on the other side of a war.</TE>
<TE>   Craig's Heisenberg, meanwhile, cautiously and courteously tries to
explain himself. Annis' Margrethe is the viewer's sharp-eyed
surrogate, offering running commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Produced by KCET/Hollywood and the BBC, "Copenhagen" gives viewers
a lot to think about. Frayn's characters embody Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle, demonstrating that people, like atomic
particles, are essentially unquantifiable, unknowable. Yet only by
continually trying to bridge that gap can humankind hope to avoid a
catastrophe of mushroom-cloud proportions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Copenhagen" will be presented Sunday at 9 p.m. on KCET and KVCR.
The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for younger
children).</TE>

<LD>   20-Year Fight Over Lennon's Items Ends</LD>
<LD>   A former personal assistant to John Lennon agreed Friday to return
374 family pictures to Yoko Ono and stop selling other Lennon
information, ending a long-running legal battle with the Beatle's
widow.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement was announced in a New York City federal court just
as closing arguments were scheduled to begin in Ono's case against
Frederic Seaman. "I have renewed respect for the judicial system,"
Ono told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Ono had fired Seaman in 1982 and later filed suit against him,
charging that he violated a confidentiality agreement by publishing a
memoir titled "The Last Days of John Lennon: A Personal Memoir."
Under Friday's settlement, the former assistant agreed to an
injunction barring him from selling or publicizing any information
relating to the Lennon family and from reissuing his book.</TE>
<TE>   Drowning Pool's Singer Died of Natural Causes</TE>
<TE>   Drowning Pool lead singer David Wayne Williams, who was found dead
in his tour bus last month, died of natural causes, according to an
autopsy released this week. The 30-year-old died of heart failure
caused by cardiomyopathy, a disease in which areas of heart muscle
enlarge and thicken, the report said.</TE>

<TE>   'Friends' and 'CSI' Score Strong Premieres</TE>
<TE>   The usual suspects dominated the ratings in the first Thursday
night of the new TV season, as "Friends" and "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" premiered in impressive fashion, while new and
returning programs positioned to piggyback on their popularity fared
considerably less well.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibiting no real signs of slowing, NBC's "Friends" opened its
ninth year with more than 34 million viewers--its most-watched season
premiere ever--to easily surpass "Survivor: Thailand." However, in
its second half hour, the CBS show rebounded to edge NBC's "Scrubs,"
which lost one-third of the "Friends" audience.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "CSI" then opened its third season with the show's biggest
audience ever (30.5 million viewers), higher than NBC's "Will &amp;
Grace" (21.5 million) and the new show from its creators, "Good
Morning Miami" (17.5 million). CBS dropped sharply at 10 p.m. with
the premiere of "Without a Trace," to 16.2 million viewers, compared
with 26.7 million who watched NBC's "ER."</TE>
<TE>   Weatherman Nance to Return Following Leave</TE>
<TE>   KNBC-TV Channel 4 weatherman Christopher Nance, who has been on a
paid leave of absence since August while the station conducted an
investigation of allegations involving him and another employee, is
scheduled to return to the air soon.</TE>
<TE>   The station declined to comment officially, but insiders have said
the investigation involved accusations of sexual harassment. The
station has not specified when Nance will return to his morning
duties.</TE>

<TE>   Struggling Vivendi to Sell Art Collection</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal's 2,500-piece art collection, which will be sold
to help pay off the company's massive debt, encompasses glass works
dating to the Roman Empire; a large group of antique drinking
vessels; artworks by modern and contemporary masters such as Pablo
Picasso, Jean Dubuffet, Joan Miro, Mark Rothko and Roy Lichtenstein;
and classic photographs by Walker Evans, Jacob Riis, Margaret
Bourke-White and Robert Frank.</TE>
<TE>   The art collection is based in New York. Some works are displayed
at the Seagram Building, a large Picasso tapestry is installed at the
Four Seasons restaurant and the rest is in storage. Vivendi has yet
to determine when the artworks will be sold and whether they will be
disbursed at auction or privately, a company spokeswoman said.</TE>

<DH>Orchestras* The L.A. Philharmonic's Synergy program helps
composers and conductors learn to work more effectively.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huddled in a small music rehearsal room at USC, composer Naomi Sekiya
and conductor James Gaffigan are perusing the score of Sekiya's
"Sinfonia delle Ombre" (Symphony of Shadows), which Gaffigan is
preparing to conduct.</LD>
<LD>   Popping in to ask questions, offer observations and clarify issues
are Los Angeles Philharmonic music director Esa-Pekka Salonen and
Miguel Harth-Bedoyah, Philharmonic associate conductor. They're part
of the Philharmonic's Synergy program, a five-day series of workshops
and rehearsals designed to help emerging American composers and
conductors work more closely and effectively together and with
orchestras. The program culminated in a concert Thursday in the Bing
Theater at USC (see review).</LD>
<LD>   The series, the brainchild of Salonen, was co-sponsored by USC and
two service organizations, American Symphony Orchestra League and the
American Music Center. Sekiya, Gaffigan and the others--eight pairs
in all--were culled from a field of 361 applicants (161 composers,
200 conductors) all of whom had some professional experience and
recognition.</LD>
<TE>   "What I hope is the composers and conductors learn about the
pressure of how to realize an idea," Salonen said. "I also wanted to
incorporate some of the practicality issues--how to maximize your
rehearsal time, how to prepare materials. These are things that when
they work perfectly, nobody comments about them. When they don't,
it's a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Sekiya, a native of Japan, now a doctoral student at USC, seconds
the notion.</TE>
<TE>   "At most rehearsals and performances, we simply don't have enough
time to communicate with musicians and conductors," she said during a
break in the workshops. "Synergy is so unique. I get to look at my
music from a conductor's point of view and also from a musician's
point of view. So I'm learning to study my music from different
angles."</TE>
<TE>   Gaffigan, her conductor, provided a new point of view. The
recipient of the first Robert Harth Conducting Award given at the
Aspen Music Festival and School, Gaffigan, 23, is in his final year
of graduate study at the Sheppard School of Music at Rice University
in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "I have different priorities than Naomi," Gaffigan said. "She's
worried about sound and balance. I'm worried about keeping it
together because there are really difficult parts. It's a bit
frustrating. The piece is also mine, in a way, to work with."</TE>
<TE>   Sekiya has received several international prizes, including
getting a work played at the Ojai Music Festival in 2000, with Simon
Rattle leading the Philharmonic. Surprisingly, she began composing
only after she came to the United States for undergraduate study in
the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do everything," she said. "You know how a 17- or
18-year-old is: You feel you can do anything if you work hard. You
can become president of the United States. I wanted to become an
English major or a history major, but I couldn't speak English. So
that was hard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I started writing music. Music doesn't require
English that much."</TE>
<TE>   She said her three-movement "Sinfonia" was inspired by Dante's
"The Divine Comedy," although it doesn't use text or represent scenes
from that work. The first movement received its premiere in Warsaw,
Poland, in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   She revised the work last summer, adding measures and changing
some of the instrumentation. It was the longest and most difficult
work presented at Synergy, and because of limited rehearsal time,
only the second and third movements were played. But their
performance constituted a world premiere.</TE>
<TE>   Sekiya likes to work big from the outset, laying out a full
orchestra score of 25 or more parts as she goes. "I want to know
which instrument is playing or not playing," she said. "Some
composers write piano scores and at the end orchestrate it."</TE>
<TE>   Once she's done, she has to provide the orchestra with at least
one copy of a conductor's score and enough individual scores for the
musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Composers who don't have professional publishers generally use
computer programs to generate the scores. Still, it's not cheap.
Sekiya estimated it cost almost $900 to provide the Synergy
performance scores. Fortunately, the American Composers Forum footed
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Self-Publishing Problems</TE>
<TE>   At a Tuesday workshop, however, Sekiya discovered that
self-publishing has dangers: The computer programs need to be
finessed or the scores can be difficult to read, with poor spacing of
the bars, awkward page turns and ambiguous markings.</TE>
<TE>   She took the news in stride. "Talking about how to improve my
notation was a good thing," she said. "Last time the L.A. Phil
performed my music, I never received that kind of comment, but I kept
doing the same things. This time, they mentioned what to do, what not
to do. I feel, 'OK, why didn't you tell me two years ago?' "</TE>
<TE>   Gaffigan, too, had some surprises during the week. For all his
preparation, he was dealt a shock with his first downbeat at the
Tuesday rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first stepped up on the podium, nothing sounded like I
expected," he said. "The piece had never been performed in the U.S.
There was no tape of it. You come up with your own sounds mentally,
and pretty much you're in shock at the first rehearsal. The biggest
lesson: You shouldn't overstudy a score or come up with an idea of
what it will sound like. You will be shocked."</TE>
<TE>   As was the case with all the conductors, Gaffigan's rehearsal with
the orchestra--half Philharmonic and half USC musicians--was
videotaped, then reviewed by Salonen.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, Esa-Pekka pointed out what I didn't have to do to be
effective," Gaffigan said. "Or spending too much time on details.
Just get on with the rehearsal."</TE>
<TE>   Workshops, rehearsals and videotape reviews of the conductors
continued up to the Thursday evening concert, which opened with a
sense of festival excitement. At the end, all eight pairs of
composers and conductors took bows to a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gaffigan at least felt there was a lot more to learn. "I
didn't think we had the best performance, because I felt there wasn't
enough preparation time," he said at a reception afterward. "This is
such a difficult piece. There's so much going on in it. There's no
way you can get it perfect unless you have two about-full rehearsals,
not half an hour here, an hour here.</TE>
<TE>   "But for the most part, we got the idea of the piece, and I think
that's the most important thing. I was a little too stressed out
about details. I think that's my biggest problem in this atmosphere.
I'm used to fixing everything and getting everything I want."</TE>
<TE>   Sekiya, however, felt "very satisfied with the performance. James
did a wonderful, exciting job. And Synergy was wonderful, conductors
and composers all together. We all felt like we're a family who had
known each other for a long time. This kind of relationship is very
important to me. I feel it will grow and continue for a long time."</TE>

<HD>Philharmonic Prices Jump</HD>
<DH>Music* Some subscribers will pay 50% more after the move to
Disney Hall. But other seats may cost less.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top subscription prices will jump nearly 50% and bottom prices will
more than double when the Los Angeles Philharmonic moves into the
Walt Disney Concert Hall next year.</LD>
<LD>   The price boost, disclosed by Philharmonic management in a Friday
letter to subscribers, pushes the priciest seats from $82 to $120
each.</LD>
<LD>   That makes the Philharmonic pricier than the Ahmanson's current
ABBA-inspired musical, "Mamma Mia!" ($25-$80), but still cheaper than
a Lakers game ($23-$175, excluding premier and suite seating) and in
the same ballpark as Los Angeles Opera ($30-$170).</LD>
<TE>   The most affordable subscription tickets for Disney Hall seats
(those on the highest level and those behind the orchestra on lower
levels) will run $35, up from $14 for rear balcony seats now. Single
tickets for performances at Disney Hall won't be available for
several months but have typically carried the same price as
subscription seats.</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic officials note that some subscribers in the middle
ranges may find the new venue more affordable: For instance, somebody
moving from a loge seat in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to a Terrace
East seat (on the third of the four audience levels) in the new hall
would find the cost dipping from $43 to $35.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also note that student and senior rush tickets--unsold
seats that are released two hours before curtain--will remain at $10.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the subscription prices do not apply to the more than 50
non-subscription performances the Philharmonic expects to stage in
Disney Hall's first year.</TE>
<TE>   But for the core of the orchestra's presentations, the overall
price trend is upward. For subscription series, Disney Hall will
feature 392 seats at $120 each, 757 seats at $88, 572 seats at $68
and 544 seats at $35. This season's lineup at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion includes about 470 Founders Circle seats at $82 each, about
400 rear balcony seats at $14 and about 2,200 seats priced in
between, $33 to $65.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra, which kicks off its 2002-03 season Oct. 3, doesn't
move to Disney Hall until the 2003-04 season, and the steel-skinned,
wavy-walled structure, designed by Frank Gehry, is still under
construction on Grand Avenue. But because of the dramatic differences
in seating in Disney Hall compared with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
in the Music Center, prices and seating charts have inspired a buzz
of speculation among subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic officials have encouraged that buzz, warning
audiences that subscribers to the 2002-03 season will have a
substantial advantage over others when it comes time to seek
subscriptions at the striking new venue. Early results suggest the
strategy has been effective: Philharmonic marketing officials say
they've sold about 23% more subscriptions for this season than last
season, about 27,000 in all. Subscription packages vary from three to
eight performances.</TE>
<TE>   Because the 2003-04 season in Disney Hall will feature 100
subscription series performances, up from 89 in the 2002-03 season,
Philharmonic officials say they don't expect ticket availability to
be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of the new venue's 2,265 seats are closer to the
orchestra than the 3,086 seats in the Chandler Pavilion, orchestra
officials say, but some seats in the new venue are behind the
musicians (and have $35 price tags). There is no formally designated
seating area to match the current elite Founders Circle, but prices
alone are likely to focus subscribers on the $120 seats in front of
the orchestra in the two lowest levels of auditorium seating.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Rappaport, owner of the Opera Shop on Beverly Boulevard and
a regular at Philharmonic performances, was shocked by the increase.
"Oh no," he said, but he added that the change wouldn't affect his
listening habits.</TE>
<TE>   "The hall is just going to be a hot item, like the Music Center
was at the beginning" in the 1960s, he said. "This too will fade."</TE>
<TE>   The price hike, marketing director Joan Cumming said, can be
traced to studies done by the staff when Deborah Borda arrived as
executive director of the orchestra in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We discovered we were significantly underpriced compared to other
orchestras across the country. We looked at Chicago, we looked at
Boston and New York," Cumming said. "So in the last couple of years
we've been trying to get ourselves back to comparable prices."
Between the 2001-02 season and the 2002-03 season, Cumming noted, the
Philharmonic's prices rose 7%. (When the Philadelphia Orchestra moved
to a new hall last December, officials there bumped prices from $94
to $110 and nevertheless saw the season's paid attendance rise 7%.)</TE>
<TE>   Added Cumming: "I have to say honestly that after doing the
research, I really don't feel that we are charging significantly
different prices than anybody else is."</TE>
<TE>   The new hall carries a projected cost of $274 million. In their
last public word on fund-raising, Music Center officials said they
had about $20 million more to raise.</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic spokeswoman Elizabeth Hinckley said workers have been
putting in the hall's gardens in recent days and taking down
scaffolding inside the concert hall, although much scaffolding
remains up in the lobby and other areas. The job of cladding the
building in steel, Hinckley said, should be done by December.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, parking prices in the Music Center garage are rising
right away. Those fees, set by Los Angeles County officials, are
increasing by $1, which puts rates at $8 for regular parking and $19
for valet parking.</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic officials said subscribers who purchased parking
passes before the county bumped the cost will be able to park at the
lower rate. Parking prices for Disney Hall--which will also be set by
county officials--have not yet been announced.</TE>

<LD>Synergy, my dictionary says, is the cooperation between different
groups, their interaction producing a combined effect greater than
the sum of their individual effects. In his great two-volume study,
"Synergetics," R. Buckminster Fuller shows that synergy is a force
for improving the world--metals interact to get stronger. When people
cooperate, they increase the wealth in society; when they are
isolated, they act warlike.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic chose the path of peace Thursday
night for "Synergy" at USC's Bing Theater. In this special program
designed to help overcome the isolation between conductor and
composer, four recent works by young composers were conducted by four
young conductors. The synergistic orchestra was divided between
members of the Philharmonic and students in the USC Symphony; had I
closed my eyes I never would have known it wasn't fully professional.</LD>
<LD>   Esa-Pekka Salonen, who acted as a mentor to the composers and
conductors, played master of ceremonies Thursday, asking the
conductors how they caught the conducting bug and how they would
describe the pieces they were about to perform. The conductors,
whether cocky or humble, did a winning job of personalizing
unfamiliar music.</LD>
<TE>   Where the synergy idea stopped, however, was in the music itself.
The composers, whose ages ranged from early 20s to early 30s,
demonstrated the kind of spectacular flare for orchestral writing
that allowed them to stand out among the more than 200 applicants for
the gig. But composers who display such competence in handling
orchestral complexities at the early stages of a career tend to be
those who best play the game, not the quirky individualists. These
are composers less interested in stretching the language than in
finding a kind of accessible narrative, in being well understood.</TE>
<TE>   Mason Bates' "Ode," which was originally written to precede a
performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, toys with the symphony's
famous tune with brightly illuminated instrumental effects almost as
if it were a cinematic prelude to the most grandiose setting of the
theme that you could imagine. Instead, it collapses into a climactic
destruction; sirens and the cocking of an unloaded shotgun spell out
war. Quietude returns, and we are meant to be ready for Beethoven's
own famous plea for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Burke's "Clockwise," a memorial tribute to his teacher, the
composer Jacob Druckman, is similarly direct in the emotions it
speaks. A thudding heat-beat rhythm that Druckman derived from the
Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, relentlessly drives the
score. In the center is a heartfelt violin solo that the composer
described as representing his feeling of anger over Druckman's death.
The writing has power, merging Druckman's distinctively aggressive
but resplendent orchestral sound with Burke's own more fretful one.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Carrillo-Cotto's seductive "Cantares"--its title meant to
represent a series of songs that blend into each other--has allusions
to early music and Middle Eastern singing. This was the one score
that seemed to speak in more than one style, although the composer's
liquid lyricism ultimately overwhelms all else. The earliest piece on
the program--it had its premiere at Pepperdine University eight years
ago, practically a lifetime away for a young composer--made one
especially eager to hear something current.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's ambitious work was "Sinfonia delle Ombre" (Symphony
of Shadows) by Naomi Sekiya, a doctoral student at USC who attracted
attention two years ago when Simon Rattle conducted her impressive
piano concerto, "Deluge," at the Ojai Music Festival. The 25-minute
symphony broke the mold from the other 10- to 15-minute, predictably
arch-shaped pieces. Indeed, it was too ambitious for the project, and
only two of its three movements could be played.</TE>
<TE>   The inspiration is Dante's "Inferno," and Sekiya's grandly
orchestrated score produced an inferno of atmosphere, with gripping
instrumental effects that ranged from a fragile flute to massive
orchestral explosions, viscerally weighed by the thudding bass drum.
It is a vast, bold world of sound that Sekiya conveys, as she becomes
increasingly confident with each new piece. The full symphony needs
to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   The four conductors were all but typecast for the pieces.
Allistair Willis, the cocky one, merrily delighted in Bates' flashy
colors. Scott O'Neil's big beat underlined Burke's stinging emotions.
Sarah Ioannides did a lovely job in conveying Carrillo-Cotto's
undulating lyricism. James Gaffigan dug whole-hog into Sekiya's sonic
inferno.</TE>
<TE>   Two important service organizations, the American Symphony
Orchestra League and the American Music Center, were the synergistic
center of this valuable enterprise</TE>

<HD>Six Teams Will Develop Trade Center Proposals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for the World Trade Center site grew more focused this week as
the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. selected six teams of
architects and planners--among them designers of the Getty Center,
Berlin's Jewish Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, Queens--to come
up with new proposals for the 16-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   The six designs will be narrowed to three by year's end, and a
final proposal--which could combine elements of several plans--will
be released in spring 2003. Each team will receive a $40,000 stipend.
The plan, which will include office space, transportation, shops and
a memorial to the fallen towers, must accommodate the interests of
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the site's owner.
Exact space requirements, which are likely to be less than the 11
million square feet specified in developer Larry A. Silverstein's
original lease for the buildings, have not yet been reached.</LD>
<LD>   The architects were chosen from 407 submissions from 34 nations by
the LMDC and a collection of architects, engineers, designers,
curators and academics.</LD>
<TE>   Among the architects selected are Richard Meier, designer of the
Getty Center; Berlin's Studio Daniel Libeskind, architects of the
city's Jewish Museum; Rafael Vinoly, designer of the Kimmel Center in
Philadelphia; and New York's David Rockwell, who designed the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The call for new proposals comes after a series of master plans,
presented to the public in July, were met with an overwhelmingly
critical reception. "A lot of the elements in those plans were well
received, and a lot will be carried forward, including the grand
promenade, the notion of preserving the footprints and residential
housing," said Matthew Higgins, an LMDC spokesman. The architects
will leave space for a memorial to be developed in a process that
begins early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Maltzan, the L.A. architect behind the recently completed
MoMA Queens, will be part of a team helmed by New York's Skidmore,
Owings and Merrill. "I have very ambivalent feelings about it,"
Maltzan said Friday. "There's a magnitude to the coming work, which
is going to be very complex and more than likely emotional."</TE>
<TE>   The six teams are:</TE>
<TE>   * Studio Daniel Libeskind, Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   * Foster and Partners, London.</TE>
<TE>   * Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey and Steven Holl,
all of New York.</TE>
<TE>   * United Architects, a team that will include Foreign Office
Architects of London, Imaginary Forces of New York and L.A., UN
Studio of Amsterdam, Greg Lynn of Los Angeles, and New York's Reiser
Umemoto and Kevin Kenon.</TE>
<TE>   * New York-based Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with Tom Leader of
Berkeley, Michael Maltzan of Los Angeles, Neutelings Riedijk of
Rotterdam, Field Operations of Philadelphia and New York, SANAA of
Tokyo, and artists Inigo Manglano-Ovalle, Rita McBride, Jessica
Stockholder and Elyn Zimmerman.</TE>
<TE>   * Think, a team that includes Shigeru Ban of Tokyo, Frederic
Schwartz of New York, Ken Smith of New York, and Rafael Vinoly,
London's Arup, Buro Happold Engineers of England, Jorg Schlaich of
Stuttgart, William Moorish of Virginia, David Rockwell of New York,
and Jane Marie Smith of Baltimore.</TE>

<LD>As 1997 segued into 1998, all was not well on the set of ABC's legal
drama "The Practice." On the air for less than a year, the series had
been collecting kudos from critics, but ratings remained anemic. As
it hobbled along midway through its second season, TV Guide summed up
the situation on its Jan. 17 cover: " 'The Practice': The Best Show
You're Not Watching."</LD>
<LD>   Yet just when it appeared that the series might end up as another
of TV's promising failures, the show began finding its audience.</LD>
<LD>   And so, as improbable as it might have seemed in early '98, "The
Practice" opens its seventh season Sunday at 9 p.m. with a dandy of
an episode titled "The Privilege."</LD>
<TE>   Written by series creator David E. Kelley and directed by Dennis
Smith, the show picks up where last season's kooky cliffhanger (Larry
King as himself?) left off: Attorney Lindsay Dole (Kelli Williams)
has her day in court for the slaying of her former serial-murdering,
victim-chomping client. And when a jailed Lindsay is visited by
husband Bobby (Dylan McDermott) and their young son, keep the tissues
handy.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the newest member of the firm, perky Jamie Stringer
(Jessica Capshaw, daughter of Kate and stepdaughter of Steven
Spielberg), who gets off on the wrong foot in a big way with another
lawyer in the firm, Ellenor (Cameron Manheim).</TE>
<TE>   But a walk-in client who wants to make amends anonymously for the
long-ago kidnapping of an infant presents the stickiest wicket. The
infant is now her 16-year-old daughter, and she has $70,000 in guilt
money for both the girl's real mother and the woman suspected by
police but never charged with the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lot to chew on, but in this season debut, "The Practice" is
just about perfect.</TE>

<HD>Read On, Macduff</HD>
<DH>A marathon of all 37 Shakespeare plays is a labor of love
and endurance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dawn Akemi was bent on gluttony of Falstaffian proportions.</LD>
<LD>   No, the lithe actress with the long brown hair wasn't starving for
a joint of venison and a tankard of ale, the sort of fare favored by
Shakespeare's fat knight. She had gone backstage at the MET Theatre
in Hollywood because she craved more of the Bard's words--more than
any sane mortal would ever want to chew. She had not been this way 12
hours before.</LD>
<LD>   That was Wednesday morning, when Akemi walked into the MET to help
read "Henry V," the opening salvo in Company's Marathon, an
unpretentious, grass-roots annual event in which actors and just
plain Shakespeare buffs spend 85 consecutive hours reading all 37
plays nonstop. The unwritten premise is that Shakespeare is the
choicest food of an actor's love--so read on.</LD>
<TE>   After her morning eye-opener with "Henry V," Akemi--one of 175
people who had signed up for the marathon--returned in the afternoon
to read various roles in "Henry VI, Part I" and Viola in "Twelfth
Night."</TE>
<TE>   And here she was again in the dressing room--curtained off from a
stage that was set up as a reading parlor with two large, comfy
couches and several easy chairs--trying to talk the marathon's
guiding force, Gordy Hoffman, into letting her pull a 2 a.m. shift
with "Pericles." She already was signed up for "Cymbeline" around
daybreak, which would take her total to five Shakespeare readings in
24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's more amazed than me. It's freakish," Akemi, who was a
certified public accountant before catching the acting bug five years
ago, said of her suddenly ravenous appetite for reading Shakespeare
out loud.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, half-supine on a wooden chair, his bare toes digging into
a burnt-orange carpet, urged discretion as the better part of valor.</TE>
<TE>   "You're crazy, Dawn. Your body's going to give out. Please go
home, sleep in your bed, take a shower. You'll be all excited to read
Cymbeline at 7:15 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   But Hoffman's a fine one to talk about moderation.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old playwright and screenwriter, whose younger brother
is actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, doesn't remember just how or when he
dreamed up the idea of a Shakespeare marathon back in 1996. It
probably came to him when he was driving a cab at all hours in
Chicago while trying to make it as a writer-director.</TE>
<TE>   This is a guy who didn't bother to read any of the plays in his
college Shakespeare course at Kansas University, cruising through on
Cliffs Notes. But he later took up acting and writing, and during a
summer acting program in England in 1995, he found himself performing
one of Shakespeare's sonnets.</TE>
<TE>   "The language came up through my heart and I started to cry." A
Shakespeare buff was born. Now, Hoffman does not hold himself out as
an expert, just an amateur, in the original Latin and French sense of
"one who loves."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman continued the marathon after moving to L.A. in 1997. In
the city that conjures up stories for the modern masses, he thinks,
there is some karmic, nurturing importance in ensuring that all of
Shakespeare's plays be heard at least once a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Here," he says, "is an untapped reservoir of language and story.
Each year the marathon wakes me up and tells me, 'Stop thinking about
the spec script you're trying to sell to the studios and think about
what you're doing.' If there's a town in America that should be
reading Shakespeare every year, it would be this town."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Shakespeare's language and stories stayed pretty
much within the small circle of participants: the four to eight
readers who tackled each play and a handful of early arrivals who
were awaiting their shifts. Mark and Bobbie Greenfield sat in the
front row and followed along in a paperback text while their
19-year-old daughter, Melissa, read Olivia in "Twelfth Night."</TE>
<TE>   Admission was free, but no other nonparticipating spectators
showed up, except for two people Hoffman said had come in earlier in
the day, nosed around a bit and left without hearing an entire play.</TE>
<TE>   For now, just having enough readers to carry out the mission is an
achievement.</TE>
<TE>   One year, Hoffman found himself reading the marathon-closing
"Henry VIII" alone and bleary-eyed in the middle of the night. He
packed it in, got some sleep and returned to finish the play the next
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Another time, the marathon fell seven plays short of
completion--the overnight shift had petered out, and Hoffman returned
to the theater to find a lone actor snoring over "Coriolanus."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, there was no marathon: Hoffman waited until December,
only to have the theater he thought he had rented boot him out in
favor of a more lucrative attraction.</TE>
<TE>   But bigger plans are afoot. This is the second year at the MET,
where the leaders are enthusiastic about the marathon. Next fall,
says artistic director Allison Gammon, the MET plans to use Company's
Marathon (Hoffman directs and produces his own plays under the
moniker Company Theater) as a kickoff for two full Shakespeare
productions of its own: "Macbeth" and "King Lear."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman is working on outreach to the L.A. theater community: He
hopes to assign about 10 of the plays to individual theater companies
next year, reserving the bulk, however, for Shakespeare lovers who
want to come out of the woodwork, lured by the fliers, Internet
presence and word-of- mouth Hoffman relied on to cast this year's
marathon.</TE>
<TE>   By 2016--the 20th anniversary of Company's Marathon and the 400th
of Shakespeare's death--Hoffman aims to have built a nonprofit
juggernaut that will be able to celebrate by mounting full L.A.
productions of all 37 plays over the course of nine months, including
performances by some of the leading national and international
Shakespeare companies.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman says this will mark Los Angeles as the Shakespeare capital
of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, things are a bit more modest.</TE>
<TE>   Jaisey Bates rang down "Henry VI, Part I," with an improvised
trumpet flourish--"duh-duh-duh-duhhh!"--then howled, "Wahoo! Yeah!"</TE>
<TE>   Without missing a beat, Hoffman quickly ushered in the next crew
of readers, who began "Twelfth Night" without missing a beat,
allowing the marathon to roll on, continuous and uninterrupted.</TE>
<TE>   "If music be the food of love," went the first line, "play on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Company's Marathon's Shakespeare marathon continues today through
10:18 p.m. at the MET Theatre, 1089 N. Oxford St., Hollywood.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever get the feeling that we're seeing too much of our pop stars?</LD>
<LD>   That thought came to mind twice last weekend, once while watching
a new DVD package containing pop highlights from the old Ed Sullivan
TV show and then while spending way too much time with Courtney Love.</LD>
<LD>   In a novel piece of programming, the flamboyant spitfire took over
MTV2 for 24 hours starting last Saturday afternoon, to do such things
as show videos (including her own) and talk to her celebrity friends,
from Michael Stipe to Ryan Adams, in person or on the phone.</LD>
<TE>   Mainly, Courtney talked about her favorite subject. Two guesses.</TE>
<TE>   She was at her best when she championed the new energy in rock
(the White Stripes, the Hives, the Strokes) and at her worst
celebrating everything Courtney. She flashed her left breast before
we even made it to the first commercial and lectured endlessly about
her role in the evolution of women in rock.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, even she had to admit that 24 hours was too much TV
time. By Sunday morning, Love was napping while MTV2 replayed earlier
moments from the program.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, the marathon underscored the excess that is
rampant on MTV and similar channels.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is that MTV might now decide to try the binge approach
with other musicians. Should we prepare ourselves for "April with
Avril"?</TE>
<TE>   MTV already gives us more personality pop than we need. Shows such
as "MTV Cribs" strip a lot of the mystery from artists by taking us
on tours of their homes, including the bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Which is where Ed Sullivan comes in.</TE>
<TE>   After "24 Hours of Love," it's hard not to yearn for the innocence
and urgency of the '50s and '60s, when seeing a pop star on
television was so rare that it was truly an event.</TE>
<TE>   We're never going back to the day when all you see of a rock star
on television is two or three songs on weekly variety shows. But
there is something to be said for swinging the pendulum back a bit.</TE>
<TE>   In its two decades, MTV has given us some hit "Unplugged" albums
and some funny moments on its Video Music Awards. Nothing in its
175,000 hours of broadcasting, however, matches the impact of a
couple of evenings of the most celebrated of those old variety shows.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ed Sullivan Show"--a family hour that offered everything from
circus acts to scenes from Broadway plays--was must viewing on Sunday
nights in millions of homes. The treat for teens was seeing one hot
pop act per show.</TE>
<TE>   When Elvis Presley first appeared on the Sullivan show in
September 1956, the ratings were enormous--as much as 80% of the TV
audience, according to some reports. Col. Tom Parker, the singer's
manager, knew the value of exclusivity, and he kept Presley's TV
appearances to a minimum. In fact, Presley didn't perform again on TV
for more than a decade after the Sullivan shows. The only way you
could see him was to pay your way into the movies.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings again were huge eight years later, when the Beatles
made their U.S. TV debut on Sullivan's show. An estimated 73 million
people tuned in--almost three times the audience for the Grammys
these days.</TE>
<TE>   Presley and the Beatles were in a class by themselves, but other
acts still stand out in "Ed Sullivan's Rock 'N' Roll Classics," a
nine-disc DVD collection that was released Tuesday by Rhino Home
Video.</TE>
<TE>   The highlights in the set, which is also available in VHS, range
from an exuberant Michael Jackson leading his brothers, the Jackson
5, through "ABC" to the Rolling Stones romping through "Paint It,
Black," with young Keith Richards bouncing around the stage like an
excited youngster rather than a cool rebel.</TE>
<TE>   We also see Jim Morrison, looking sexier than any rocker since
Elvis, singing "Light My Fire" with the Doors. And there's Creedence
Clearwater Revival's John Fogerty twisting his vowels into
Delta-speak on "Proud Mary," and James Brown's scorching "Prisoner of
Love," and Janis Joplin's foot-stomping "Raise Your Hand."</TE>
<TE>   If seeing these highlights now is exciting, you can imagine how
the images stuck in kids' minds in the '50s and '60s. In those days,
fans replayed the memories of that five- or 10-minute performance
over and over in their heads as they listened to the artists'
records--waiting for the day the act came to town so they could see
the artist in person.</TE>
<TE>   With the overexposure on MTV, pop fans now have to spend a lot of
their time erasing worthless images from their minds. I'd trade
everything Love did during her 24 hours in front of the camera for
three minutes of a great new song.</TE>

<HD>Prison Terms Affirm IRS Campaign on Tip Income</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four Nevada casino workers were sentenced to prison this week for
conspiring to underreport their tip income, in a case that could have
implications for bartenders, barbers, restaurant servers and anyone
else who receives tips as part of his wages.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first criminal prosecution regarding tip compliance
in the country, and its consequences apply to all tip-earning
employees everywhere, not just Nevada casino dealers," said Byram
Tichenor, special agent in charge of criminal investigation for the
Internal Revenue Service in Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The government criminally prosecuted the dealers because they
cheated not only on their own taxes but also helped dozens of
co-workers cheat too, said Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Criminal prosecutions remain rare, but the government says it has
become more aggressive in pursuing civil cases involving unreported
tip income.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States will continue to prosecute individuals who
commit such offenses," U.S. Atty. Daniel G. Bogden said.</TE>
<TE>   News of the case alarmed some Southern California workers who
receive tips.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anyone who is that careful about reporting every
dollar," said a Glendale waitress, who asked not to be named for fear
of IRS prosecution. "It's not even that you're trying to cheat on
your taxes. It's that you've got cash in your pocket, and you spend
it before thinking too much about how much you had."</TE>
<TE>   Creating a fear factor was partly the point, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the IRS wanting to send a message," said Patricia M.
Erickson, attorney for one of the Las Vegas defendants. "They want
people to report 100% of what they earn in tips."</TE>
<TE>   The case is the latest move in a decade-long effort by the
government to boost disclosure of tip income, which is believed to be
chronically underreported. A report by CCH Inc., a Riverwoods,
Ill.-based tax research and information firm, estimated that $5
billion to $8 billion in tip income goes unreported each year.</TE>
<TE>   The sentencing also comes on the heels of a Supreme Court
decision, handed down in the summer, that held the managers of a San
Francisco restaurant liable for their workers' underreported tips.
That decision spurred the restaurant industry to seek relief from
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   This week Reps. Wally Herger (R-Marysville) and John S. Tanner
(D-Tenn.) introduced the Tip Tax Fairness Act, which would stop the
IRS from making employers responsible for reporting their workers'
tip income to the government. Restaurant owners, in particular, say
they object to be turned into "tip police" by the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   In many casinos, however, the employer knows how much tip income
is earned because dealers are barred from carrying cash on the casino
floor under a system designed to deter theft.</TE>
<TE>   Many casinos keep tip boxes at each gaming table. All the tips
deposited in those boxes are turned in at the end of the day. The
tips are distributed equally to all dealers on that shift, gaming
industry officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The individuals in the Nevada case, which dates to the mid-1990s,
were charged with falsifying records to keep IRS estimates of their
tip income artificially low, said spokeswoman Collins of the U.S.
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The three dealers who were convicted--Belinda Mosdell, Leveda
Taylor and Leo Shan How--were ordered to pay restitution of $1,148 to
$1,532. Dale Seipp, controller of the Virgin River Hotel &amp; Casino,
where the dealers worked, was convicted of aiding the conspiracy and
fined $1,388.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the four also was sentenced to six months in prison,
government officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Published reports said the workers submitted records listing their
tip rate at $5.50 an hour. Their true hourly tip rate was $7.05 to
$10.46, prosecutors said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acacia Research Corp. said Friday that it lost a patent infringement
claim against television makers over its "V-chip" technology in the
early stages of litigation.</LD>
<LD>   The claim was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in Connecticut,
the Newport Beach company said. Acacia might pursue antitrust charges
or file an appeal.</LD>
<LD>   V-chips, designed to let parents block adult and violent shows
from their sets, are required in televisions with screens larger than
13 inches and sold after 1999. Acacia said about 25 million new TVs
are sold in the U.S. each year.</LD>
<TE>   Acacia's Soundview Technologies has filed a patent and antitrust
suit against some TV makers, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Assn. and the Consumer Electronics Assn., which is pending before the
U.S. District Court in Connecticut. Soundview also has filed a
federal lawsuit in Nevada against 17 TV makers over the use of
V-chips.</TE>
<TE>   Acacia's stock fell 76 cents Friday to $4.08 on Nasdaq. The price
has fallen 63% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Automakers Vow to Unite on Clean Diesel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chief executives of the world's major automakers pledged Friday to
work together for global standards on car safety and environmental
regulations with an aim to reduce emissions and cut costs.</LD>
<LD>   In a joint statement issued after a meeting at the Paris auto
show, 13 auto industry CEOs said they would work together on three
main issues: international standardization of vehicle regulations,
worldwide acceptance of clean diesel technology and the promotion of
advanced technology and improved fuel quality.</LD>
<LD>   It was a rare expression of unity in a fiercely competitive
business in which car companies battle their rivals for every point
of market share. Attending the meeting were the heads of BMW,
DaimlerChrysler, Fiat Auto, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., PSA
Peugeot Citroen, Porsche, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda Motor Co.,
Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp.</LD>
<TE>   A key goal is a universal standard for and acceptance of clean
diesel fuel for passenger vehicles. But that could be a tough sell in
the U.S. and particularly in California, which has the toughest clean
fuel standards in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Although diesel engines already are widely used in passenger
vehicles in Europe and Asia, the cleanest versions are still thought
to be too dirty for jurisdictions, such as California, with severe
smog.</TE>
<TE>   The automakers contend that permitting use of the so-called clean
diesel technologies would lead to improved fuel economy and thus
reduced emissions of the environmentally damaging greenhouse gases,
such as carbon dioxide, that are produced as fuel is burned in
internal combustion engines.</TE>
<TE>   "Current diesel engines are dramatically more efficient than
conventional gasoline engines in terms of both fuel economy and
carbon dioxide emissions. Diesel engines also have the potential to
meet stringent requirements regarding local emissions," the CEOs said
in their statement.</TE>
<TE>   California regulators disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "The nitrogen oxide limits in our 2004 emission standards are so
tight that we haven't seen any diesel-powered production vehicle that
can meet them," said Rich Varenchik, spokesman for the California Air
Resources Board. "The automakers have always told us our 2004
standards are too difficult for a diesel vehicle to meet."</TE>
<TE>   European governments, he said, "seem willing to trade some air
quality for fuel economy, but in California we simply cannot afford
to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists were heartened by the automakers' apparent
willingness to work together but cautious about celebrating too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very positive, and if we really can get a majority of
auto industry leaders working together to improve safety and
environmental standards around the world, it should be supported,"
said Tim Carmichael, director for Los Angeles-based Coalition Clean
Air.</TE>
<TE>   But Carmichael said clean diesel technologies still have not been
proved.</TE>
<TE>   It would be more heartening, he said, if the auto executives had
issued a call to come together and work toward producing a
commercially viable fleet of zero-emissions vehicles over the next
decade or so. "That would get us a lot faster to where we believe the
industry should be," Carmichael said.</TE>

<HD>Port Negotiations a Battle for Control</HD>
<DH>Labor: With the push for efficient technology at West Coast
terminals, the main dispute is over who will oversee the flow of
information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The labor dispute playing havoc with West Coast docks has never been
about pay or benefits. What's at stake in the battle between shipping
lines and dockworkers is who will control port operations from San
Diego to Seattle and, in the long run, the fate of one of the last
powerful unions in America.</LD>
<LD>   For four months, the titans have been wrestling over questions
that, when viewed individually, may seem insignificant, even petty.
The International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific
Maritime Assn. have spent weeks on arcane language that spells out
how to introduce equipment such as scanners and sensors rather than
on such traditional issues as wages. Tempers have flared over the
union's insistence that a few hundred computer operators be brought
under the contract that already covers 10,500 dockworkers.</LD>
<LD>   Taken together, however, these issues will determine who controls
the information that is crucial to keeping cargo flowing through
modern ports. And one thing on which both sides agree is that, in an
age of computers, bar codes and remote cameras, controlling such
knowledge is power.</LD>
<TE>   "We know this technology is coming," said one union official who
asked not to be named. "We want to anticipate how it's going to be
used and be sure we're involved in it. We're talking about our
survival."</TE>
<TE>   Carriers and stevedoring companies that annually move billions of
dollars of goods through the ports say they are desperate to improve
efficiency, the key to cutting costs. They argue they could achieve
that if the union would allow them to use available technology.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of information, such as the content of containers, is on
Web sites already," said Tom Edwards, a PMA manager in Northern
California who has been directly involved in negotiations. "It can be
sent electronically from shippers and enters the terminal's data
base, so that when the container arrives at the terminal, all the
information is there, and they can change that information at any
time electronically. It's done seamlessly."</TE>
<TE>   Such faster information is important to speeding up the flow of
traffic through the terminals. Under the current longshore contract,
however, all documentation in the terminal must originate with union
clerks. That language, which shipping lines consider archaic, has
been used repeatedly by the union to justify retyping cargo
information into the terminal computer system--even if it is already
available electronically. Shipping lines have fought the re-keying
issue for years through arbitration but have repeatedly lost.</TE>
<TE>   In what it described as a major concession, the union agreed in
the current talks to give up some language so information could flow
freely from shipping lines around the world to port terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Once there, however, the union wants guarantees that only union
clerks could review, correct or change data. Carriers "want that
somebody else can get into the operating system and start doing the
work even after the information comes into the terminal," said ILWU
spokesman Steve Stallone.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're allowed to do that, then our clerks don't have any
work anymore," Stallone said. "We lose the control over the
information, which is a significant part of the power of the union
and a major part of our jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The fight over the flow of information in the terminal is just one
of several thorny and complex issues that both sides have deadlocked
on in recent months, all centering on control.</TE>
<TE>   The union also wants the shipping lines to expand union
jurisdiction to certain planning jobs, such as the layout of
containers on a ship. Many of those jobs are performed remotely, as
far away as Utah or Arizona. The union insists that such planning
jobs are part of the documentation chain, and thus belong in the
union.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping lines disagree, and say those jobs were never part of
the union's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute involves only about 80 jobs, but they are key to the
orderly departure and arrival of ships--and both parties say it is a
nonnegotiable item.</TE>
<TE>   A third issue that neither side says it will blink on is minimum
staffing levels for clerks. The union's technology proposal calls for
specific numbers of clerks to check in trucks at gates, or to monitor
the flow of containers through the yard. The shipping lines say the
numbers are inflated--that for example, one clerk can handle five
truck gates at a time, rather than two. The union insists the
minimums are necessary to prevent the jobs from speeding up and
becoming more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say they have given in on such demands in the
past, but are determined to stand fast in this round. They say the
long-term health of U.S. ports is at stake because inefficient ports
could drive shippers to Mexico or elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The union, however, justifies its concerns over control and
jurisdiction by pointing to other former labor heavyweights, such as
the United Steel Workers of America, which once controlled an
industry but now struggles for relevancy.</TE>
<TE>   That is not an irrational concern--or unique to the longshore
workers, said labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein of UC Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic issue in industrial society, going back more
than 100 years," he said. "Technology is always changing, and the
question becomes who is going to do what work. Unions often want to
use their leverage to move into something else, and management often
fiercely resists that. It's classic."</TE>

<HD>They'd Rather Be in Des Moines</HD>
<DH>Big conventions are fleeing L.A. The city's remedy could be
to think small.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget Las Vegas. These days, Los Angeles would settle for being the
Des Moines of convention cities.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. may be America's second city, but it's No. 22 in North
America and trailing the Iowa capital (No. 21 on the latest list)
when it comes to the number of small and large trade shows it
attracts. Reno books more multi-day shows than does Los Angeles. So
does Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau has booked only 16
major conventions for 2003, compared with 28 this year and 35 in
2001. The recession and Sept. 11 have hurt convention business across
the country, but L.A. seems to be losing ground faster than
others--and for a number of reasons.</LD>
<TE>   "The glamour of Hollywood and all that doesn't do anything for
us," said Deb Hammond, who organizes the annual convention for World
Wide Distributors, a national group of 1,500 retail vendors that has
chosen Reno over Los Angeles. "L.A. is too expensive, too big to be
comfortable and difficult to get around. Our show keeps us in a city
for four or five nights, and we just want something more simple."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles still hosts a big car show each year, but it attracts
mostly locals. The downtown Convention Center also is home to one of
the biggest trade shows in the country, the annual four-day
Electronic Entertainment Expo, which attracts about 75,000 attendees
for several nights each May. Yet holding on to that show has come at
a steep price. The visitors bureau has charged the group a mere $1 a
year in rent since 1999, an agreement that is good until 2005.
Regular rental rates for a group that size are $500,000 or more, but
Convention Center officials say discounting is necessary to keep
larger shows from moving to other cities.</TE>
<TE>   The slippage in L.A.'s convention business comes as the city is
trying to make its downtown more vibrant. Indeed, the core of L.A.
arguably is more appealing than it has been in years. Staples Center,
dozens of top-flight restaurants and the new Standard hotel--a magnet
for L.A.'s glitterati--have all helped the City of Angels become a
more sophisticated urban center.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in the last three years, 42 major conventions have
abandoned L.A. for other locales. City officials and local hoteliers
have blamed the cancellations on mismanagement by the visitors
bureau, a quasi-public entity that has a city contract to attract
large conventions. Earlier this year, the bureau was chastised by the
Los Angeles City Council for wasteful spending and awarding bonuses
to its sales staff for booking conventions that later were canceled.
The bureau agreed to implement reforms and expand its board to
include a critic of its past practices.</TE>
<TE>   It clearly has a long way to go. The Convention Center has never
landed the 38 big-ticket, multiple-day, revenue-generating trade
shows it says it needs each year to break even. Next year, the meager
list of conventions is expected to mean a $35-million drop in visitor
spending.</TE>
<TE>   Grasping for a remedy, the downtown business community is urging
L.A. officials to start thinking more like Reno and Des Moines--which
focus on regional events that appeal to a range of visitors, from
rodeo aficionados to computer-game geeks--and look beyond big-name
national groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't be so picky," said Bill Worcester, general manager of
the Los Angeles Marriott Downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "It would never have occurred to us three years ago to be worried
about losing business to Reno," Worcester added. "But when you see
the latest numbers, it makes you worry about losing business to
everyone, everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, Worcester and the general managers of nine other
downtown L.A. hotels sent a letter to visitors bureau officials
calling for "fundamental changes" in the way the agency conducts its
business. The hoteliers also said they want to be included in sales
and marketing plans aimed at improving the "lack of current and
future bookings for the downtown area." Convention officials have
agreed to meet with hotel operators next week.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Johnson, spokesman for the Greater Des Moines Convention and
Visitors Bureau, said none of his city's top conventions seem as if
they would be "an L.A. fit." Des Moines' biggest trade show, the
World Pork Expo, is an international event that draws as many as
75,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "We have groups that are pretty comfortable right here in the
Midwest," Johnson said, noting that Des Moines has 2,000 hotel rooms
within walking distance of its convention center and is within a few
hours' drive from several large cities, including Minneapolis. "I
mean, could they go to L.A.? I guess so. Would they go to L.A.? Nah.
Probably not."</TE>
<TE>   Cities fight fiercely for convention business, which generates
sales and hotel-room taxes. In all, there are only about 500 premier
trade shows and meetings nationwide up for grabs each year. And any
city's gain is another's loss. It's a "zero-sum game," said Michael
Collins, executive vice president of the visitors bureau.</TE>
<TE>   "The forecast is not very positive for us right now," he
acknowledged. "Our convention attendance is going to drop for the
third year in a row. Our city is losing market share to other cities.
Our worst fears are finally catching up with us."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. has always had to work hard to attract conventioneers. Its
reputation as a sprawling, traffic-clogged metropolis hasn't helped,
and neither has the meager number of hotel rooms--650--within walking
distance of the Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Anaheim--with 7,700 hotel rooms, recently
expanded convention complex and Disneyland a block away--ranks No. 14
on the Center for Exhibition Industry Research list of top U.S.
convention cities based on the number of annual gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim has booked 42 major expos for all of 2003, nearly three
times the number for L.A. Meanwhile, San Diego, California's top
convention city, is expected to see a 30% increase in convention
business in 2003, according to a recent report by UBS PaineWebber.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles started losing shows to Orange County a little more
than two years ago, when Anaheim's expansion project and revitalized
tourist district were completed. Before that, L.A. was able to chalk
up 33 major conventions two years in a row, in 1998 and 1999,
stealing business from Anaheim while it was in the midst of
construction.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, the Convention Center underwent a $525-million
expansion, doubling the site's size to 805,000 square feet of meeting
space. However, the city-funded project has been unable to attract
the 3.7 million annual attendees it originally hoped for in order to
pay for the project. Last year, the Convention Center attracted about
1.9 million people.</TE>
<TE>   That has put the convention bureau in a Catch-22. It's tough to
persuade the city to help back more downtown hotel rooms and
entertainment projects without the convention bureau proving that it
can attract more visitors. But without the projects, the visitors
don't want to come.</TE>
<TE>   "When we fly into Reno or Vegas or even Mobile, Ala., the airport
is right there close by the convention site and it's real easy to get
where you need to be," said Peggy Knizer, an organizer of the
National Agricultural Aviation Assn., which holds an annual meeting
of its 2,000 members. "We don't want traffic issues and we don't want
to pay $100 or more a night for a room. L.A. probably just isn't the
place for us."</TE>

<HD>Ford to Retrofit Police Cruisers</HD>
<DH>Safety: The gas tanks on Crown Victorias will be reinforced
to prevent rupturing. Consumer groups say the fix should include
civilian models.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from law enforcement agencies, Ford Motor Co. said
Friday that it would the reinforce fuel tanks on hundreds of
thousands of Crown Victoria police cars in an attempt to prevent more
accidents of the kind that have burned to death at least 10 police
officers.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer advocates praised the move but said the action fell short
because it excludes civilian versions of the car with the same gas
tank design.</LD>
<LD>   Ford said it would install rubber and plastic shields around the
fuel tanks to help prevent them from puncturing and bursting into
flames if the police car is rammed from behind, as has happened in
numerous cases.</LD>
<TE>   The world's No. 2 automaker also will provide a special container
to hold sharp objects in the trunk that could puncture the gas tank
and set up a Web site for police to maintain communication about
avoiding punctures and accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "No automaker can prevent accidents, but we've advanced the state
of the industry by taking developmental testing to an unprecedented
level," Ford's vice president for safety and environmental
engineering, Sue Cischke, said at a news conference in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Ford set up a technical task force and a blue-ribbon panel that
studied the problem for three months. Cischke made the announcement
in Phoenix because the automaker was spurred to investigate the
matter by Arizona Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano, who said the state
would stop buying the vehicles after three Arizona Highway Patrol
officers died in fires in the modified cars known as Crown Victoria
Police Interceptors.</TE>
<TE>   There are 350,000 Crown Victoria police cruisers on the road, "and
all will be retrofitted," Napolitano said at the news conference. "I
hope and plan that all the retrofits will be done by January."</TE>
<TE>   Ford would not say what the fixes would cost.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates said that a move to retrofit the cars was
needed but that Ford should recall all Crown Victorias sold to
consumers, as well as Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car
sedans, which are built on similar platforms. There are about 3
million of such Panther platform cars on the road, including police
cruisers.</TE>
<TE>   Safety advocates also questioned whether Ford's testing would be
sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's proposed fix should be tested by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration or another independent source to
confirm whether occupants who survive a rear impact of 80 mph or more
won't die in an ensuing fire, said Joan Claybrook, president of the
consumer group Public Citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1978, when Ford agreed to recall the Pinto, NHTSA conducted
its own crash tests, and these tests showed Ford's proposed remedy
was inadequate and needed to be upgraded significantly before NHTSA
would approve a recall," said Claybrook, who headed the agency from
1977 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators should rigorously examine Ford's proposals because the
gas tanks should not explode even in a high-speed impact, said
Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Ford has tried to mislead the public into believing the
fire crashes in Crown Victorias are unsurvivable due to high speed,"
he said, "they are generally survivable because the Crown Victoria
has so much crush space and strong seats to absorb the energy of the
crash."</TE>
<TE>   Cischke said that the cars have a good safety record and don't
need to be recalled and that retrofitting would be done only to
Police Interceptor models and not to sedans sold to the public.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer and early fall are supposed to be high season for Ron Hoagland
of Azusa Gold, a mining supply store at the foot of the San Gabriel
Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   From June through October, amateur miners stop at Hoagland's store
in a strip mall on North Azusa Avenue to pick up supplies ranging
from simple gold pans to $10,000 power dredgers and washers before
heading for the wilderness off East Fork Road west of Mount Baldy.</LD>
<LD>   This year, though, gold season has been replaced by fire season.</LD>
<TE>   The closure of parts of the Angeles National Forest for
recreational uses until the rainy season has killed off Hoagland's
business, plunging daily sales to $5 to $10 a day from the normal
$200 to $300.</TE>
<TE>   The giant Williams wildfire burning in the mountains is an
economic disaster for Hoagland and dozens of business owners and
their employees who depend on the vast recreation area for their
livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as long as the blaze stays up in the mountains, away from
the roughly 10,000 homes that firefighters say are in reach of the
flames, the effect on Southern California's multibillion-dollar
economy will be minimal overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like trying to figure out what the cost is of rounding up
another bear that has wandered into Monrovia," said Jack Kyser, chief
economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Other costs from the fire include hundreds of evacuees missing
work; visits to doctors by individuals sensitive to smoke and ash;
the loss of about 75 cabins and small structures in the mountains;
and the estimated $10-million expense of fighting the fire for state
and regional governments. There also may be some intangible drain
from how the blaze adds to the apocalyptic image of Southern
California as a place of fire, flood and earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   "It might encourage tourists to book trips elsewhere," Kyser said.</TE>
<TE>   At LaVerne Car Wash on Foothill Boulevard, business this week was
particularly slow; people don't want to get their cars washed as long
as ash is raining from the sky.</TE>
<TE>   But Greg Meier, the business' general manager, expects things to
pick up soon. "I assume that once the fire is out, we will be very
busy because people will want to get that ash off their cars," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some can't afford to wait. The Ford dealership in Upland has had
to increase its car-washing schedule from twice a week to four times
a week for vehicles on its lot so that new vehicles will remain shiny
for perspective buyers. Yet the fire has not kept customers from the
showroom, a sales manager said, perhaps because new models have just
arrived and financing incentives are about to expire.</TE>
<TE>   Some businesses actually are profiting from the wildfire.
Firefighters and evacuees have pushed the occupancy rate at Super 8
Motel in Azusa to about 75% of its 44 rooms this week, compared with
an average of 50% that is typical on weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   Disasters often have a stimulative effect on a local economy in
the months that follow, Kyser said. The Northridge earthquake in 1994
sparked an economic boomlet the following year as federal disaster
money and insurance payments flowed in, the economist said.
Earthquake-related building also helped the construction industry in
the San Fernando Valley rebound one to two years earlier than other
Southern California regions from the economic slump of a decade ago.
However, there is no indication that the Williams wildfire will have
the same effect.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, Cal Risen, owner of El Encanto Restaurant on Old San
Gabriel Canyon Road, and his 25 employees are out of work.</TE>
<TE>   Risen said his restaurant has been closed for nine days over the
last month because of fires in the local mountains. This week, his
parking lot was a staging area for firetrucks and other equipment.
Absent were the cars of his patrons from Azusa and surrounding
communities. The restaurant, originally built as a home in 1920,
normally serves about 500 meals a week.</TE>
<TE>   "This has not been good for us," Risen said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if firefighters can get enough control over the blaze to
reopen his block, Risen said, he should be able to get back to
business fairly quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Others are less optimistic. "It looks like I am going to have no
business for as long as two months," Hoagland said. The mining-shop
owner is considering closing his doors and not reopening until late
November.</TE>
<TE>   Hoagland is a dual victim. He lives in Follows Camp, one of the
evacuated areas. After staying a day at a local motel, he is sleeping
on a makeshift bed of foam rubber and a sleeping bag in his store to
save money.</TE>
<TE>   The fire's timing is especially bad for him. It comes in the final
weeks of the period when miners are allowed to use expensive power
equipment in mountain streams. Regulations prohibit the use of the
equipment during the winter and spring to protect spawning fish.</TE>
<TE>   Hoagland has fire insurance that would help if his store were
overrun by flames. But he has no coverage for the losses he is
suffering from the closure of the forest.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not sure," he said, "if the store is going to survive this."</TE>

<HD>Cendant Seeks to Distance Itself From Homestore</HD>
<DH>Probe: Chairman says his company is not involved in
investigation of the Internet firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The chairman of Cendant Corp, concerned that his company's
relationship with Homestore Inc. is dragging down its stock price,
told analysts Friday that his company is not a target of the
investigation into Homestore's phony-revenue scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant Chairman Henry R. Silverman said there is "absolutely zero
basis in reality" for rumors of his company's involvement in the
scheme, talk he blamed on short sellers attempting to benefit from
declines in Cendant's stock.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not involved in the Homestore investigation," Silverman
told analysts during a conference call.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors and Securities and Exchange Commission
attorneys in Los Angeles, who filed criminal and civil charges this
week against three former executives of Westlake Village-based
Homestore, didn't return calls seeking confirmation of Silverman's
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The three former Homestore executives admitted to roles in a 2001
criminal scheme, in which barter deals with other companies were
booked by Homestore as genuine advertising revenue. The complaints
against the executives refer to a "major media company," which
sources say is AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online unit, but don't
mention a company similar to Cendant.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant, the New York-based franchiser of Century 21, Coldwell
Banker, Avis, Ramada and other brands, is the largest shareholder in
Homestore, which provides real-estate-related services, information
and products online.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant executives didn't return calls seeking comment on the
company's relationship with Homestore. AOL spokesman John Buckley
said this week that AOL is "confident that our deal with Homestore
and our accounting for it was appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Cendant agreed to sell its Internet real estate site, Move.com, to
Homestore two years ago for 26.3 million shares of Homestore stock--a
stake whose value soared from $761 million to $998 million on the day
of the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The merger with Move.com, completed in early 2001, created what
Homestore's then-Chief Executive Stuart Wolff described as
"synergistic opportunities ... as well as increasing financial
benefits."</TE>
<TE>   On the day the merger closed, Merrill Lynch analysts Henry Blodget
and Kirsten Campbell said, "As the competition falls to the wayside,
Homestore continues to plod along, securing its spot as the dominant
online real estate player."</TE>
<TE>   Cendant also helped support a fee-based Homestore service that
gave sales leads to agents, by paying for subscriptions for 180,000
agents who worked at Cendant franchises--about half of Homestore's
subscription base in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   One early crack in Homestore's armor showed up in a Salomon Smith
Barney survey of Cendant agents in August of that year, which found
that only a third of them would renew the subscriptions if they had
to pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   After Homestore disclosed the sham accounting in January and
ousted its top executives, its shares, which had closed at a high of
$122.25 on Jan. 25, 2000, plunged below $1, erasing more than $9
billion in shareholder equity. Cendant ultimately was forced to write
down its entire stake in Homestore. Homestore's shares fell 3 cents
Friday to 33 cents in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant shares had climbed to nearly $20 in March before sliding.</TE>
<TE>   The stock tumbled more than 13% this week, closing at $10.75 on
Thursday, after the company announced Wednesday that it would take a
$175-million charge against third-quarter earnings because falling
mortgage rates and unprecedented refinancing activity had eroded the
value of its big mortgage-servicing portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Silverman scheduled the conference call partly in response to that
news, saying the market had overreacted. He also said the SEC has not
rekindled an earlier inquiry into some of Cendant's financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant shares rose 25 cents to $11on the New York Stock Exchange
on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Panel Asks FDA for Data on Mentor Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A congressional subcommittee probing the safety of breast implants
told the Food and Drug Administration on Friday to turn over all
records from the agency's criminal investigation of Mentor Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The House subcommittee on oversight and investigations asked the
FDA in a letter to produce the file by Oct. 9. The FDA confirmed it
had received the demand.</LD>
<LD>   Based in Santa Barbara, Mentor is one of the world's largest
makers of saline-filled breast implants. Questions about the safety
of such implants arose in July when the FDA reviewed data that showed
nearly one-quarter of implant procedures required a new operation in
five years and few implants last 10 years. The most common complaints
were pain and hardening of scar tissue, but leakage of saltwater and
deflation of implants also were problems.</LD>
<TE>   Mentor came under criticism at the FDA hearing for contacting only
a small number of women for its follow-up study. The agency ordered
Mentor and its cross-town rival, Inamed Corp., to conduct follow-up
studies when it granted them approval to market the saltwater-filled
implants in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Mentor's difficulties go beyond the hearing. Beginning in 1998, it
was the subject of a four-year FDA criminal investigation, which the
congressional committee said is now closed. In regulatory filings,
Mentor has said it did not know what the probe was about. The company
had no comment on Friday's developments.</TE>
<TE>   However, a USA Today story from March 2000 cited in Mentor's
regulatory filings reported that the investigation centered on
"allegations of serious irregularities in breast-implant studies."
The article quoted Mentor general counsel Douglas Altschuler as
saying the allegations lacked merit.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional committee opened its investigation in July. At
that time, it asked the FDA for documents on Mentor and Inamed and
for the Mentor criminal file, if it no longer was active.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee's letter to the FDA was released after the
markets closed. Mentor shares rose 55 cents to $30.29 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Dow Slumps on Earnings Warnings</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Index drops 295 points to post its fifth
straight losing week, nearly canceling gains from a two-day rally.
Nasdaq and S&amp;P fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow industrials plunged 295 points Friday, closing out the fifth
straight losing week for U.S. stocks as a fresh batch of profit
warnings and analyst downgrades highlighted the shaky outlook for
corporate earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Philip Morris, Delta Air Lines and drug maker Wyeth were
hammered after the companies warned of weaker-than-expected results
in the third quarter or for all of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   General Electric weighed on blue-chip indexes after brokerage
analysts at Lehman Bros. and Credit Suisse First Boston cut their
ratings on the conglomerate. On Thursday, GE cautioned that business
at some of its units "seems to have stalled."</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody is waiting for signs of a pickup in corporate profits,"
said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Capital Management
in San Francisco. "Pricing power remains weak, stock valuations are
still fairly rich, and the Mideast situation is adding to all the
uncertainty among investors."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow fell 295.67 points, or 3.7%, to 7,701.45, nearly wiping
out the big gains of Wednesday and Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Among broader indexes, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 27.58
points, or 3.2%, to 827.37, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index lost 22.45 points, or 1.8%, to 1,199.16.</TE>
<TE>   The sell-off left the Dow and the Nasdaq near their multiyear lows
reached early in the week, and the S&amp;P 500 not far from its low
reached July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Losing stocks swamped winners by 5 to 2 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. Volume was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields, meanwhile, resumed their descent as investors
sought haven from the equity market at almost any price and some
investors bet that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates
before year-end in another attempt to spark the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note fell to 3.66% from 3.77%
on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow lost 3.6%, the S&amp;P 500 slid 2.1% and the
Nasdaq slipped 1.8%. All three major indexes have lost ground each
week since Aug. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The latest economic reports offered a mixed picture of the U.S.
economy. The University of Michigan's final September consumer
sentiment index slipped to 86.1 from 87.6, its lowest reading since
November amid a soft job market and talk of war.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the government raised an earlier reading of the pace of
second-quarter economic growth. Gross domestic product, the broadest
measure of the economy's health, rose at an annual rate of 1.3% in
the second quarter, the Commerce Department said, up from the 1.1%
estimated a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Schlossberg said that although recent economic data have been
"neutral or slightly negative" on balance, profit warnings have been
coming at a rapid clip during the quarter's so-called confession
season, and he said Wall Street analysts have been steadily lowering
their earnings forecasts, just as they did late in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, S&amp;P 500 profit is expected to rise 7.5% in the third
quarter from a year earlier, he said, citing data from Thomson First
Call, but at the start of this quarter analysts surveyed were looking
for better than 16% growth.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Orndorff, head of equities at Los Angeles-based money
manager Payden &amp; Rygel, said investors may be more pessimistic than
warranted by the economic picture these days.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of panic out there," Orndorff said. "Investors
have reversed the mantra of the 1990s, which used to be 'Buy on the
dips.' Now it's 'Sell on the rallies,' so the advance we saw on
Wednesday and Thursday had people thinking, 'It's time to sell.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Dow rallied 314 points in two days before Friday's sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the economic uncertainty, the market is in the throes
of its worst season, historically. September has been the weakest
month for stocks, on average, and true to form, the S&amp;P 500 is off
9.7% this month. While not as dismal on average, October has seen
several scary sell-offs, including the 1987 crash.</TE>
<TE>   For the third quarter, the S&amp;P 500's 16.4% drop would be the
index's largest since a 23% plunge during the fourth quarter of 1987,
according to Bloomberg News data. Monday is the quarter's last
trading day.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's trading, GE sank $1.92 to $24.47. Among other blue
chips, Gillette and insurer Chubb also slumped in the wake of
downgrades or cautious new ratings from Wall Street analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette lost 95 cents to $30.01 and Chubb slipped $5.07 to
$53.91.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of their warnings, Philip Morris fell $4.87 to $37.86,
Delta lost $2.81 to $8.69 and Wyeth dropped $7.35 to $31.10.</TE>
<TE>   In foreign trading, Brazil's Bovespa index plummeted 5.3%,
reaching a three-year low. Indexes were mixed in Europe and
moderately higher in Asia.</TE>

<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. founder and director Philip
Anschutz spoke by phone with congressional investigators examining
his knowledge of the company's financial troubles, a source close to
the Denver billionaire confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   House Energy and Commerce Committee staff members were focusing on
sales of nearly 6.1 million shares in May and June 2001 that netted
$213.5 million for Anschutz Corp., solely owned by Anschutz.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest at the time said Anschutz was trying to diversify his
portfolio and use the money for other business interests. The source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied that insider information
was involved in the sales. He said proceeds went into Anschutz's
other business ventures.</LD>

<LD>Home improvement retailer Lowe's Cos. said it expects earnings to
grow 19% to 20% annually over the next two years, with revenue up 18%
to 19%, helped by its expansion into lucrative urban markets.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe's, which ranks behind Home Depot Inc., also said it expects
to meet the upper end of its third-quarter earnings guidance of 39
cents to 40 cents a share and full-year guidance of $1.74 to $1.75.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts polled by Thomson First Call have estimated Lowe's would
post a profit of $2.08 a share for its fiscal 2003, which would
represent about a 19% increase over the consensus per-share profit
estimate of $1.75 for fiscal 2002. The consensus estimate for its
third-quarter profit is 40 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Lowe's shares fell $1.17 to $42.48 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge accepted the bail posted last week by former Tyco
International Ltd. Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, after a
hearing to determine whether the money came from proceeds of alleged
crimes against the company.</LD>
<LD>   Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus rejected the
bond secured with shares of Tyco stock posted by former Chief
Financial Officer Mark Swartz.</LD>
<LD>   Obus said he was satisfied that the $10 million in cash posted by
Kozlowski's ex-wife, Angie, on his $100-million bond was part of
their divorce settlement. In Swartz's case, the judge said the
defense had not proved that the stocks were unrelated to any criminal
activity. Swartz was given more time to argue his case.</LD>

<LD>Investors pulled a net $2.9 billion from U.S. stock mutual funds in
August, an industry trade group said.</LD>
<LD>   Although far less than the record $52.6 billion that was withdrawn
in July, it marked the third-straight month that stock funds have
suffered net outflows of cash. The outflows appear to be continuing
for a fourth consecutive month as the stock market posted multiyear
lows in September, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The August withdrawals from stock funds pushed year-to-date
activity from positive to negative, putting the fund industry on
track for its first year of net cash outflows since 1988.</LD>
<TE>   Bond funds took in a net $17.4 billion in August, a smaller inflow
than July's record $28.1 billion, the Investment Company Institute
said.</TE>

<HD>WellPoint to Rethink CareFirst Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing a raft of criticisms from legislators, consumers and doctors,
WellPoint Health Networks Inc. said Friday that it would reconsider
the terms of its $1.3-billion bid for CareFirst Inc., a nonprofit
health insurer with 3.2 million members in the Eastern United States.</LD>
<LD>   The bid is a key part of WellPoint's strategy to expand into the
East and solidify its position as the nation's largest provider of
Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans. The biggest, Blue Cross of
California, is owned by WellPoint, a publicly traded company based in
Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   But WellPoint's plans to buy CareFirst, which is based in
Maryland, has come under increasing fire after a report prepared for
Maryland's insurance commissioner said the bid was low. Citizens
groups, meanwhile, have pounced on the deal, saying the conversion of
CareFirst into a for-profit enterprise would hurt the public interest
while resulting in a fat payoff to CareFirst executives and
WellPoint.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, WellPoint signaled that it would press ahead with the
deal, saying it has asked regulators in Maryland and Washington,
D.C., to continue their review of the merger. Maryland's insurance
chief, Steven Larsen, had given WellPoint until Friday to say whether
it would keep pursuing the takeover after the consultant report
valued CareFirst between $1.38 billion and $2.25 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen's office also has commissioned experts, at WellPoint's
expense, to examine the finances and the fairness of the transaction.
A spokeswoman for Larsen said Friday that the commissioner planned to
announce a decision next year. WellPoint also needs approval from
officials in Washington, Delaware and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint statement issued Friday, WellPoint and CareFirst said
they would evaluate revisions in the next 60 days. Company
representatives declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts viewed the statement as a sign that WellPoint may
raise its bid. WellPoint's stock rose $1.11 to $74.26 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Arthur Lord, 60; Producer Covered Major Stories in Three
Decades With NBC News</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Lord, an Emmy-winning NBC News producer who covered many of
the major stories of the last four decades, including the Vietnam
War, the Persian Gulf War, the Apollo moon landings and the Iran
hostage crisis, died Wednesday at UCLA Medical Center. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   His family did not disclose the cause of death but said he had
been hospitalized for more than two months for multiple ailments.</LD>
<LD>   Lord was a New York native and graduate of the University of
Florida who began working at NBC in 1966 after a three-year stint in
the Air Force as a public information officer. Hired as a news writer
and producer, he wrote reports for some of the network's top anchors,
including Chet Huntley, David Brinkley and Frank McGee.</LD>
<TE>   In 1971 the network made him an on-air correspondent and sent him
to Saigon to cover the war in Vietnam. He filed daily battlefield
reports for 18 months in the war zone, leaving to head the network's
Houston bureau.</TE>
<TE>   He returned in 1975 as Saigon bureau chief. During the chaotic
closing days of the war, he arranged the evacuation of 104 of NBC's
Vietnamese employees and their family members. He escorted large
groups of evacuees to the airport, where nervous airport guards fired
at their vans, and he bribed officials with $100 bills to get the NBC
contingent to safety.</TE>
<TE>   Lord often said the rescue, dubbed "Operation Peacock" after the
network's longtime symbol, was his proudest accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   His wife gave birth to their daughter Sharon at an Army field
hospital in Saigon. The Lords also adopted a Vietnamese teenager,
Marlene, who was the daughter of their nanny.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the U.S., Lord headed NBC News' Burbank bureau from 1979
to 1982. He closed his career at the network as a producer for
special projects, coordinating coverage of papal visits and
presidential trips.</TE>
<TE>   Lord, who won two Emmys and a Peabody, was often a vocal critic of
journalism practices.</TE>
<TE>   He called the media's saturation coverage of the O.J. Simpson
trial "one of the most disgraceful periods in U.S. journalism."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a stakeout. I'm not reporting. I'm collecting," he told a
Houston Chronicle reporter in 1994 when he supervised the network's
"O.J. unit" of eight full-time staffers and a dozen outside
consultants. "There's such a drive to put something on the air every
day. We've even interviewed the guy who loads the candy machines at
the jail."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a man known for his extreme integrity," said NBC
correspondent George Lewis. "He was very committed to honesty and in
his dealings with other people he was always known as a straight
shooter. He was one of a kind in this business."</TE>
<TE>   Lord was one of three NBC News staffers chosen to participate in
an internal investigation of a 1993 "Dateline NBC" report on the
safety of General Motors pickup trucks in which the producers rigged
a truck explosion. Then-NBC News President Michael Gartner resigned
over the scandal, along with other news division employees involved
in the story.</TE>
<TE>   Lord retired from NBC in 1996 but remained active in professional
circles as president of the Los Angeles Press Club, raising
scholarship funds for student journalists.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Susan, and a son, Michael, both of
Tarzana; two daughters, Sharon of Santa Monica and Marlene of
Houston; and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. Sunday at the Skirball
Cultural Center, 2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Los Angeles. The family has
requested that any donations be sent to the Southern Poverty Law
Center, 400 Washington Ave., Montgomery, AL 36104.</TE>

<DL>VITOGO REEF, Fiji</DL>
<LD>Bobbing in a lonely coral reef, Manoa Kurulo spies his tiny prey,
takes a snorkel breath and dives into the water. The nimble
blue-and-orange quarry darts away through the stony underwater
garden.</LD>
<LD>   Kurulo is a lumbering giant in comparison. Slicing through the
water, he gradually herds his prize--a Fiji blue dot puffer the size
of a man's thumb--into a fine mesh net strung between two stands of
coral. The little fish is worth its weight in silver. He scoops it
into a bucket already sparkling with an orange-and-brown goatfish and
three shimmering silver-green damsels.</LD>
<LD>   The puffer has survived enormous odds to reach adulthood in a sea
of hungry predators, disease and storms. Now, it is on the verge of
embarking on a new and unnatural migration across the globe in the
cargo hold of a 747.</LD>
<TE>   Kurulo's bucket is the first stop in a 5,500-mile journey that
will carry the puffer from the pristine waters of Fiji to a warehouse
on a stretch of 104th Street near Los Angeles International Airport
known as "Fish Street," regarded as the hub of the world's aquarium
fish trade.</TE>
<TE>   Kurulo will get about 38 cents for his fish. By the time his
little puffer reaches a tropical-fish store on Pico Boulevard, it
will sell for $13.</TE>
<TE>   Driven by advances in aquarium technology and the economic boom
years of the 1990s, exotic fish and the coral where they live are
among the hottest wild-caught pets in America and Europe. They make
up a $235-million annual trade that has become both a blessing and a
curse across the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   In a good week, Kurulo earns upward of $100 harvesting fish and
live coral, more than twice the World Bank's per capita income
estimate for Fiji. He sends much of his earnings back to the remote
island village of Wayalevu, where his wife and daughter live in a
village of traditional thatched Fijian bures and concrete-block
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, Walt Smith, Kurulo's boss
and president of marine animal wholesaler Walt Smith International,
drives his black BMW X5 to his new 15,000-square-foot Fish Street
warehouse--both the fruits of Fiji's reef fish and coral.</TE>
<TE>   Yet along with the bounty have come questions over whether the
industry is contributing to the demise of the world's coral reefs.
Across the Pacific, thousands of divers have culled the waters of
moray eels, yellow tangs, coral banded shrimp and other exotic marine
creatures in their desperation to eke out a meager living. None of
the popular tropical fish are in danger of extinction, but in some
areas, fish such as yellow tangs and Bangai cardinals have reached
dangerously low levels, marine biologists say.</TE>
<TE>   The Indo-Pacific is notorious for its dangerous and destructive
methods for capturing fish. Collectors often dive into the water with
plastic air tubes wrapped around their waists, tethering them to old
paint compressors. Periodically, they take breaths from the tubes,
typically inhaling a mixture of air and exhaust fumes.</TE>
<TE>   Divers in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam often squirt
cyanide into the reefs to stun the fish, making their capture easier.
Many of the fish die of poisoning, slowly wasting away on the trip to
the United States or succumbing during their first weeks in a
hobbyist's tank. Other divers destroy the reef habitat by using
hammers and chisels to hack apart generations-old coral heads,
breaking them into pieces small enough to fit into home aquariums.</TE>
<TE>   By some industry estimates, as many as one-third of the 30 million
aquarium fish harvested each year perish in the long chain that leads
from the reef to the hobbyist's tank. They die by stewing in hot
plastic bags and buckets of stale water as they wait for shipment.
Piles of tiny fish are scooped out each day from stuffed Styrofoam
shipping boxes that are short on water to trim shipping expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "In some shipments if they get only 50% mortality they are happy,"
said Craig Shuman, a scientist for Reef Check, a monitoring group
based at UCLA's Institute of the Environment.</TE>
<TE>   Striving for 'Green'</TE>
<TE>   Given the odds, Kurulo's puffer is one of the lucky ones. He was
caught by Smith's company, one of a group of leading collectors in
Fiji attempting to transform the industry into a "green" and
sustainable business by varying their fishing sites and improving
storage and shipping practices to slash the mortality rate.</TE>
<TE>   His Fiji station also is experimenting with collecting fish at the
early-juvenile stage and raising them in captivity.</TE>
<TE>   Kurulo, like other collectors in Fiji, has learned that a gentle
capture is a crucial factor in the fish's chances for survival.</TE>
<TE>   When frightened, his little puffer will inflate its body to nearly
twice its normal size to make itself look more formidable to
predators. But Kurulo's underwater moves are so deft that the puffer
and three others caught within minutes show little signs of alarm as
they are transferred from the reef to the boat.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McLeod, manager of Smith's Fiji operations, pilots his 26-foot
boat Brittany and its cargo of live fish and coral back to the
warehouse after a day of harvesting with Kurulo. On a typical day,
Kurulo will capture as many as 80 of the tiny puffers.</TE>
<TE>   The little puffer is tucked away with the other fish, darting back
and forth in a plastic tub--an unimaginably small world compared to
the endless reef they knew just minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through the journey, McLeod throttles back the engine.
Kurulo knows the drill. He dips a bucket into the ocean and empties
it into the tub, providing the animals with clean water and oxygen.
It's all part of the company's efforts to keep its mortality rate to
less than 2% of what it captures.</TE>
<TE>   The engines rev again and the Brittany points to shore. Perfect
white-sand beaches and tangled mangrove forests streak by. The sea is
so glassy that Kurulo can look over the side and see fish, sea stars
and vast growths of coral as the boat speeds over the shallow water.</TE>
<TE>   The little puffer would have passed its entire life hunting small
crustaceans and invertebrates that live within the large honeycombed
boulders of Porites coral and the brown-and-blue tinted thickets of
Acropora.</TE>
<TE>   Kurulo knows these waters as intimately as any stretch of
land--where to find the stands of Acropora, the spreading disks of
table coral, sprouting like giant toadstools from the ocean floor,
and the swirling bursts of angelfish, tangs, butterflies and damsels
prized by hobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Diving has allowed Kurulo, 38, a standard of living far above what
he earned in his previous job working on a road crew for the Fijian
government. He owns two of the 77 homes in his island village--a
traditional bure and a concrete-block home. There's no power on the
island, but Kurulo is saving to buy a solar generator that would
allow him to operate a television, a video player and a radio.</TE>
<TE>   The ability of the marine aquarium industry to put cash in the
hands of villagers represents one of the greatest potential benefits
of a business that badly needs reform, said Bruce W. Bunting, a
veterinarian who heads the World Wildlife Fund's Center for
Conservation Finance.</TE>
<TE>   On average, marine aquarium fish sell for more than 80 times the
value of fish caught and killed for food export, Bunting said.
Putting a greater percentage of that money into the hands of
collectors--in the Philippines and Indonesia, divers earn maybe $50 a
month--will encourage the villages of Micronesia and the Indo-Pacific
to create protected areas and fishing areas and to limit the
pollution that is killing reefs worldwide, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The leaders of this industry want to see it cleaned up, and they
know that this is the time to do it," said Bunting, who also serves
as chairman of the Marine Aquarium Council, a trade group
implementing a set of reforms and a certification process for
catching and transporting the animals.</TE>
<TE>   The council's standards cover the entire supply chain--from reef
to retailer--setting targets to reduce mortality and demanding that
collectors and exporters certify that their animals were caught
humanely, without poisons or other destructive techniques. The first
council-certified fish are expected to appear in U.S. retail shops in
the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   As Kurulo ties up the Brittany at the warehouse dock, McLeod
reaches for the container holding the puffer and the rest of the
day's catch. McLeod slowly adds saltwater from the warehouse's
filtering system to the container to acclimate the puffer to the
water that will flow through its holding tank.</TE>
<TE>   Fish Out of Water</TE>
<TE>   In its own environment of the reef, the puffer is a hardy species,
able to survive through sheer weight of numbers and the countless
hiding places within the coral stands and rocky storm rubble. But
once removed from the reef, it becomes a fragile slip of color,
dependent on humans to re-create a constant and complex environment.</TE>
<TE>   The puffer's home waters never seem to change much. That stability
creates a challenge for the hobbyists who attempt to replicate a
slice of the reef in their living rooms. If the puffer is to thrive
in captivity, its water temperature should rarely vary by a degree or
two from 78.</TE>
<TE>   The salinity in the aquarium must remain steady, protected from
the swings of water evaporation from such a small habitat. The same
holds true for alkalinity, which on the reef never strays far from a
pH of 8.2.</TE>
<TE>   Even just an hour out of its native habitat, Kurulo's 38-cent
puffer is feeling the stress of adapting to its new world of a small
plexiglass cage. Although the elaborate saltwater storage and
filtering system at the warehouse provides the puffer with water
nearly identical to that of its home, the fish cowers in a corner of
its small holding tank, unable to find the expected refuge of coral
branches.</TE>
<TE>   McLeod's workers won't feed the fish for three days. They know
from experience that it is better to have a hungry fish than one that
will foul its shipping water with the previous night's dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The puffer will gradually acclimate in the coming days, but by
then it will be time to pack the fish in a plastic bag with fresh
saltwater and then into an insulated box with dozens of other fish
for the 11-hour overnight flight to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   New Home and a Name</TE>
<TE>   For this puffer, and the other fish on this shipment, it is a race
against time.</TE>
<TE>   McLeod's workers give the fish enough water and oxygen to last
through the roughly 24-hour journey of loading docks, cargo holds and
customs inspections until their arrival and acclimation into the
tanks at the stateside warehouses on Fish Street. About 98% of the
fish from Nadi Airport in Fiji survive the flights.</TE>
<TE>   The puffer arrives in seemingly good health. He is part of a
shipment that includes coral and the other puffers collected by
Kurulo. In a few days Eric Hartung, the owner of L.A. Aquarium,
selects the puffers out of the thousands of fish offered by the Fish
Street warehouses each day.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Bouchet, a sixth-grader from Mar Vista with an interest in
ocean life, walks into L.A. Aquarium that weekend and scans the rows
of bubbling tanks. The 11-year-old is quickly drawn to the
blue-and-orange puffer and hands over $13 for the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Once again the little puffer gets packed into a plastic bag for
the journey to yet another home, half a world away from his native
reef. He goes into a 15-gallon aquarium on a table in Alex's bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   The puffer, now named Roy, swims in the tank, is fed after Alex
gets home from trombone lessons and football practices each day, and
sleeps pressed up against a large rock in the aquarium.</TE>
<TE>   But in less than eight weeks from the day Kurulo netted the puffer
out of the reef, Alex looks into his tank and discovers that Roy is
dead. It might have been the water chemistry, a disease picked up in
transit or merely the stress of the long journey and the series of
increasingly smaller homes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a new shipment of puffers has arrived at Fish Street.</TE>

<HD>Workers Locked Out at Ports on West Coast</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Cargo operations at seaports from San Diego to Seattle ground to a
halt Friday when terminal operators locked out unionized dockworkers
in a showdown that threatens to paralyze the nation's leading gateway
for waterborne trade.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, called for a "defensive shutdown" of the West
Coast's 29 ports from 6 p.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Sunday in response to
alleged union slowdowns that have disrupted movement of cargo
intermittently during the last two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   About $300 billion in cars, clothing, electronics and other goods
annually move through West Coast ports. By one estimate, a protracted
shutdown--whether by lockout or strike--could cost the U.S. economy
$1 billion a day.</LD>
<TE>   A top federal labor negotiator headed to San Francisco,
headquarters of both the PMA and the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union, late Friday afternoon, seeking to defuse the
escalating tension.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration was closely monitoring the situation and
remained "hopeful the two parties will come back to the table and
continue negotiating in good faith," said Sue Hensley, a spokeswoman
for the Labor Department.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA alleges that the ILWU is using work actions to inflict
economic pain on the shipping companies to gain leverage in contract
negotiations, which broke down this week.</TE>
<TE>   The management group said it would reopen the ports if the union
agreed to resume moving cargo normally while both sides tried to get
back to the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not tolerate the union's calculated work actions, and
have exhausted every option to keep peace on the waterfront," PMA
President Joseph Miniace said in a statement. "... They have engaged
in a widespread job action that has brought the West Coast waterfront
to its knees."</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU, which represents 10,500 dockworkers up and down the West
Coast, called the PMA's lockout "a tirade" born of frustration over
stalled contract negotiations, which have produced little in four
rancorous months.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest hurdle is the PMA's desire to implement labor-saving
technology at the ports, which could cost union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU said snarled container traffic at major ports is not a
union slowdown, but rather the result of heavy volume that has
dockworkers scrambling to keep up in the midst of the peak shipping
season for the upcoming holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Although the management group has designated the lockout a
"cooling-off" period, Friday's action heightened concerns that it
could provoke the union into a strike. ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone
said the union is not considering a strike now. He said dockworkers
would return when the PMA reopens the ports.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball is in their court," Stallone said. "We are ready to
work."</TE>
<TE>   Although record levels of cargo are moving through West Coast
ports, industry experts say, shipping lines and terminal operators
have been struggling financially because of excess capacity that has
forced the companies to lower their rates.</TE>
<TE>   Average union wages last year, including overtime and premiums,
were $80,000 for longshore workers and $158,000 for foremen,
according to the PMA.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no choice but to implement this defensive lockout," said
Chuck Raymond, president of CSX Lines, a major shipping company. Even
a short lockout will be expensive, Raymond said, costing $800,000 a
day in lost operating revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA said the union's latest work slowdowns, which began
Thursday night and escalated Friday, affected every major West Coast
port.</TE>
<TE>   Although the union denied a slowdown, the employers group cited a
host of examples. At a terminal in Oakland, the PMA alleged that a
crane operator who normally handles 30 containers an hour moved just
three an hour Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex, which handles 60% of
cargo on the West Coast, the PMA said union workers refused to work
extended shifts.</TE>
<TE>   At the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the world's
third-busiest port complex, port officials and the U.S. Coast Guard
were preparing a holding area to anchor ships unable to unload their
cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Richard McKenna, a spokesman for the Marine Exchange, which
is responsible for managing vessel traffic at the port complex, said
about 30 ships were due to arrive by Sunday morning. The ships will
be asked to anchor in rows on a first-come, first-served basis.</TE>
<TE>   A similar situation arose after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
when 29 cargo ships were forced to anchor offshore for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain level of excitement about the whole thing, but
we feel we can handle it," McKenna said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Port of Los Angeles' new Maersk terminal at Pier 400, there
was a growing line of frustrated drivers waiting to pick up and
unload their cargo Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Many are independents who own their own rigs and are responsible
for paying for fuel and maintenance. They work on commission, with
short-haul drivers making about $150 a day for two or three shipments
between Los Angeles-area rail yards and the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   When terminal operators closed the gates at 2:30 p.m., horns
blared and angry drivers spilled from the long line of rigs.</TE>
<TE>   Local freight-hauler Francisco Lopez, 35, normally makes three
trips a day to the ports. But Friday, he figured he would be lucky to
complete one.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm mad, and so is the whole world about this," he said. "The
company doesn't pay us for waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Even a short delay can be devastating for a long-distance hauler
trying to get goods across the country on a tight schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "I came from Phoenix, and now I'm stuck with this load,"
Texas-based trucker Arturo Cadillo said. "I'll spend the weekend at a
truck stop. I'll be losing $700 a day."</TE>
<TE>   Robin Lainer, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront
Coalition, which represents major retailers and manufacturers that
depend on the ports, said some of her clients were suffering too.</TE>
<TE>   Although a daylong shutdown at the ports might sound trivial, "it
might be days before your box is dug out," Lanier said. That's a long
time "if you're a high-fashion retailer whose stock turns every six
weeks or so."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear late Friday just how badly the shutdown would
affect the giant network of railroads that connect the ports to the
rest of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Union Pacific Railroad said late Friday that it would stop
accepting marine containers at all its West Coast terminal facilities
at 6 p.m. today but would not elaborate as to why. Those facilities,
whose employees are mostly members of a railroad union, are where the
railroads transfer their containers onto trucks that serve the ports.
Mike Furtney, a Union Pacific spokesman, could not say how long the
ban would last.</TE>
<TE>   But Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, which moves more
intermodal traffic than any railroad in the world, will continue its
operations, spokeswoman Lena Kent said. She said inbound cargo would
be taken to the ports and stored until it could be offloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, canceled a trip to San Antonio and boarded an airplane to
San Francisco on Friday afternoon to try to find a resolution to the
brewing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Toner, Hurtgen's chief of staff, said the two sides had not
asked for federal intervention. He said Hurtgen was hoping to get the
two sides talking, although the specific plan was a "work in
progress."</TE>
<TE>   The mediation service needs the invitation of both parties to
become officially involved in a labor negotiation, something Toner
said he did not think had happened as of Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "Any kind of work stoppage would be detrimental to our economy,"
he said. "Our job is to try to stop that."</TE>
<TE>   Emotions were running high at the Port of Los Angeles on Friday
evening, shortly after the lockout began. Angry union workers poured
into the parking lot at Pier 400, drawn by a report that there was a
nonunion person working at the giant Maersk terminal, in violation of
union rules.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU official Joe Donato later told the crowd that an unidentified
Maersk superintendent had climbed into the crane to replace a hatch
on a ship so it could sail.</TE>

Robinson-Jacobs contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Jimmy Stoneman, 65, bass player and a vocalist for the country music
act the Stoneman Family, died Sunday in a nursing home in Smyrna,
Tenn., of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease.</LD>
<LD>   Following in the footsteps of their mother and father, 1920s-era
pioneering country music recording pioneers Ernest V. "Pop" and
Hattie Stoneman, the Washington, D.C.-born Jimmy Stoneman and other
members of the large family formed a group in the 1950s, the Blue
Grass Champs.</LD>
<LD>   The group took first place in "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts"
competition in 1956 and began touring.</LD>
<TE>   Renamed the Stoneman Family after they were joined by Hattie and
Pop, the family group reached the country chart in 1966 with the
Top-40 single "Tupelo County Jail."</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, the Stonemans won the Country Music Assn.'s vocal group
of the year award. After Pop Stoneman died a year later, the family
continued to perform until they retired from touring in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Stoneman, whose full name was Oscar James Stoneman, was one
of 23 children, 13 of whom survived to adulthood.</TE>

<HD>Blood Test to Detect HIV in 20 Minutes Nears Approval</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators are expected to give final approval soon to an
easy-to-use finger-prick blood test that can diagnose HIV infection
in 20 minutes. The action will come more than four years after public
health officials declared the urgent need for such a tool.</LD>
<LD>   People familiar with the approval process say the Food and Drug
Administration has resolved lingering technical and manufacturing
issues that have held up approval.</LD>
<LD>   AIDS advocacy groups have accused the FDA of dragging its feet
while reviewing tests that have been proved extremely accurate and
used in 90 other countries. Some of the proposed blood tests are as
easy to use as a home pregnancy test or blood sugar monitors for
diabetics.</LD>
<TE>   The test proponents say the delays have endangered the public's
health because nearly a third of those who test positive for HIV each
year never return to find out their results, which can take as long
as two weeks to process. When that happens, infected people go
untreated and spread the virus unwittingly to others.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential for saving lives by using this technology, we
think, is revolutionary," said Clint Trout, associate director of
federal government affairs for Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare
Foundation. "We think that the rapid test could be for prevention
what protease inhibitors have been for treatment."</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials declined to comment on their timeline. The agency
granted preliminary approval in May to two rapid HIV tests, pending
inspections of manufacturing plants and approval for the products'
labeling.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear when the approval announcement will be made but
some people familiar with the process say it could come within the
next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The first test slated to be approved is OraQuick, manufactured by
OraSure Technologies of Bethlehem, Pa., people familiar with the
process said.</TE>
<TE>   When the test detects the presence of HIV antibodies, it displays
two red bars on a small strip enclosed in plastic. The device is
designed for just one use, and the company has not disclosed its
price.</TE>
<TE>   With approval near, the debate has shifted to a separate issue
that could determine whether the rapid HIV test is widely used.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS activists and public health experts want the federal
government to waive requirements that the tests be performed only in
technically sophisticated labs.</TE>
<TE>   Though not advocating home use, those advocates say they want the
test to provide quick results to sex-club visitors, homeless people
at shelters and emergency room patients. Those target populations are
among the most likely not to return for their results after they are
tested.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters also want to offer rapid tests to late-term pregnant
women. If a woman tests positive for HIV before or during delivery,
she and her baby can be treated with medications, reducing the
chances of transmitting the virus by two-thirds or more.</TE>
<TE>   The military is interested in using rapid HIV tests on the
battlefield. When there are many casualties, doctors often request
immediate blood donations from fellow soldiers, and there's little
time to test for infections.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these arguments, an advisory panel to the FDA has
recommended that the government require the tests be performed at
sophisticated laboratories. The panel found that untrained personnel
often fail to follow manufacturers' test instructions and may lack
the skills to interpret the results.</TE>
<TE>   "Until it can be demonstrated that individuals performing this
test out on the street have a significantly high degree of accuracy
in performing the test, the potential danger to the person being
tested is simply too high at this point," said Dr. Jared Schwartz, a
pathologist and spokesman for the College of American Pathologists, a
medical specialty society that also accredits labs.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Nelson Michael, a strong backer of rapid tests, disagrees with
that reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   "These tests are ridiculously simple," said Michael, chief of
molecular diagnostics and pathogenesis at Walter Reed Army Institute
of Research. "You basically defeat that ease of testing if you demand
that the test be executed in sophisticated laboratories."</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been seeking
advice from both sides on ways to allow widespread use of the tests
while ensuring accurate results, said Dr. Bernard Branson, a medical
epidemiologist with the agency. The agency held a conference in
Atlanta earlier this month to discuss the topic.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. Each year, more than 20 million people are
tested for HIV, including 2 million in publicly funded clinics.
Federal health officials estimate that 40,000 people contract the
virus each year, and 900,000 people are living with it.</TE>
<TE>   The standard test for HIV, known as ELISA, takes a minimum of five
hours to process, and sometimes as long as overnight. But because the
test often is sent to labs--where it is run in batches--results often
are not available for days or even weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Both with ELISA and the new rapid test, a person may be infected
for several months before producing enough HIV antibodies to show a
positive result.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC estimates that about 9,600 HIV-positive people do not
return to the publicly funded sites for their test results each year,
in addition to about 860,000 people annually who test negative but
don't find out. In many cases, test takers are not required to
provide their identity or a way to reach them.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a missed opportunity, both in terms of people being aware
of their status and informing their partners," said Michael
Montgomery, director of the office of AIDS within the California
Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   A presidential advisory council and even some members of Congress
have grown restless that test approval has taken so long.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an FDA that is a bureaucracy that is totally
uncontrolled," said former Rep. Tom Coburn, a physician who chairs
the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. "Bureaucrats never
take a chance to do something right. They always take a chance to
protect their own backside."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Elliot Cowan, a senior regulatory scientist at the FDA, said
his agency is "working on it as fast as we can.... It would be far
worse in my mind, at least, to approve a product and then have it
fail once it reaches the marketplace," Cowan said.</TE>
<TE>   In their defense, federal officials point to British Columbia,
Canada, where rapid testing was halted this April because of concerns
that test kits provided negative results to people who actually had
HIV.</TE>
<TE>   An official at OraSure said he understood the reasons for the
lengthy approval process.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a regulatory protocol that needs to be followed, and
they are following that," said Ronald H. Spair, the company's chief
financial officer. "I can't characterize anyone as stonewalling
this."</TE>
<TE>   Once its OraQuick product is approved, the company wants to
conduct studies on a rapid test using oral fluids instead of blood.
Other companies want to manufacture rapid tests based on urine.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, OraSure's product won't be the first rapid HIV test
in the United States. Since 1993, Abbott Diagnostics has sold a test
that can provide HIV results within 20 minutes. But advocates and
public health experts say the test isn't very useful because it
requires cold storage before use and is labor-intensive to perform.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott has developed an easier-to-use rapid test, called
Determine, which is manufactured and widely used outside the United
States, but the company has not sought approval to sell it here. It
is partnering with OraSure to distribute the OraQuick test here.</TE>
<TE>   MedMira Inc., based in Canada, had expected the go-ahead a year
ago. Instead, it received its preliminary approval in May, and
officials are still waiting for the green light. The entire research
and development staff is now devoted to working with the FDA to
answer remaining questions.</TE>

<HD>USC's $100-Million Academic Pursuit</HD>
<DH>Education: The bid to upgrade its faculty may heat up
bidding wars for the nation's best professors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major initiative to upgrade its reputation and compete
nationally for faculty superstars, USC is launching a $100-million
effort to hire 100 high-profile professors over the next three years,
campus officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The recruiting campaign will expand by nearly 25% the full-time
faculty at the university's College of Letters, Arts &amp; Sciences,
which includes such departments as comparative literature, economics
and biology. More broadly, it could heat up the bidding wars among
the nation's major universities for academics with top-flight
credentials, particularly in budding research fields.</LD>
<LD>   USC officials said the College of Letters, Arts &amp; Sciences--the
biggest undergraduate division, but also home to many graduate
students--traditionally has had a weaker reputation than other
schools at USC. They said the lagging status of the college has
threatened to hinder what has been a dramatic rise in the stature of
the university in the last decade.</LD>
<TE>   "In many ways, the College of Letters, Arts &amp; Sciences is the core
of a university, and if we wanted to achieve the position we wanted
in the hierarchy of universities in the world, we needed to improve
the college," said Lloyd Armstrong Jr., USC's provost.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said a successful fund-raising campaign launched in 1993
and ending this year has so far collected more than $2.5 billion in
gifts and pledges. It has provided USC with the resources to fund
much of the hiring initiative.</TE>
<TE>   USC officials said about two-thirds of the $100 million for the
hiring effort, known as the senior faculty initiative, is already
pledged or in hand for salaries, labs, support staff, moving expenses
and housing aid. The rest is expected to be raised soon. "This is not
an iffy thing," Armstrong said. "This is going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The university will focus on hiring high-profile professors in
three broad areas: biology and other life sciences; urban studies and
globalization; and language and culture. Officials said they have not
begun to identify particular candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Aoun, dean of the college since 2000, said the aim is to
"single out initiatives that we can excel at and, at the same time,
make a contribution not only to academia but the nation as a whole."
Aoun emphasized the expansion in the life sciences, which he said has
important implications for expanding biotechnology industries and
related fields in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The College of Letters, Arts &amp; Sciences provides the majors for
about 40% of USC's undergraduate students, and accounts for about 30%
of its PhD candidates. The university's overall enrollment is nearly
31,000 at its main University Park campus south of downtown Los
Angeles and its health sciences campus in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Higher education officials applauded the move as a bold stroke
destined to draw attention to USC as an increasingly significant
force on the national education scene.</TE>
<TE>   "USC has clearly made a very important commitment to quality
and to being a major player in the area of private higher education,"
said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education,
which represents about 1,800 colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   The recruiting campaign, Ward said, will draw the attention of the
sorts of top-tier, highly recruited professors that USC wants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very shrewd, very strategic move," he said. "They're
saying they've got a war chest, that they'll be hiring in several
thematic areas and that they're giving themselves three or four years
to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting such a large group, Ward added, puts out a message to
potential recruits that "not only are they being hired, but that they
may have new colleagues of similar stature," Ward said. "That's very
attractive."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement also is likely to throw down a gauntlet of sorts
to top public universities, perhaps particularly UCLA, at a time when
shrinking state budgets and small pay raises have made administrators
worry about their ability to retain senior faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, UCLA officials have said they didn't worry that USC
would be able to make serious runs at their faculty members.</TE>
<TE>   Around the country, bidding wars have been especially hot in such
fields as genomics, bioengineering and ethnic studies.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard and Princeton earlier this year waged a high-stakes
tug-of-war over prominent African American scholars, with Princeton
in the end stealing away Harvard stars Cornel West and K. Anthony
Appiah.</TE>
<TE>   But some higher education officials question the trend, saying it
rewards a tiny number of gifted academics at the expense of students,
other faculty members and higher education as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, point to the success of New York University,
which in recent years spent lavishly on faculty recruitment,
scholarships and a new campus and managed to transform itself from a
middling commuter school to one of the nation's premier private
universities.</TE>
<TE>   NYU's makeover grabbed the attention of many in higher education,
including USC President Steven B. Sample.</TE>
<TE>   USC has quietly succeeded over the last few years in luring such
big-name faculty as Thomas H. Jordan, a geophysicist from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Kenneth H. Nealson, a
geobiologist from Caltech; and James Higginbotham, a philosopher from
Oxford University.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said that after the $100 million is spent on initial
salaries, equipment, research efforts and other costs over about
three years, USC will budget about $30 million a year to continue
such support. He said that in some cases, compensation packages for
the new professors will exceed $200,000 a year, mainly in the
competitive research fields.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other enticements for some of the professors is a new
$60-million life sciences building with cutting-edge equipment.
Construction is scheduled to begin in January and to be completed in
2004. In addition, USC recently announced a $100-million effort to
strengthen and step up recruiting for its graduate programs, mainly
through financial aid.</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Holds 2 Foreigners</HD>
<DH>Asia: Local authorities contend U.S. nurse and British
academic violated tourist visas by visiting rebel territory. The two
say police abused them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Iowa nurse Joy Lee Sadler says that when she came to Indonesia, she
wanted to help care for sick people and spend some time at the beach.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, she and her traveling companion, British academic Lesley
McCulloch, were thrown into jail by local authorities Sept. 10 for
traveling to a part of Indonesia that is held by separatist rebels.</LD>
<LD>   Sadler, 57, says the soldiers who arrested them at a checkpoint in
war-torn Aceh province punched her in the stomach and jaw, and held
the 43-year-old McCulloch at knifepoint and fondled her. For days,
they say, they were denied access to embassy officials and lawyers.
Sadler says she suffered an attack of angina because of the stress.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities say the two violated conditions of their tourist visas
by entering an area controlled by the rebel Free Aceh Movement, and
could face five years in prison. They say the women had documents
about the rebels and were researching the Aceh conflict.</TE>
<TE>   McCulloch, who recently completed a year as a lecturer at the
University of Tasmania in Australia, has written articles in which
she said the Indonesian military is killing civilians in Aceh.</TE>
<TE>   "They are charged with violating their tourist visas because they
have engaged in activities that were beyond what a tourist would do,"
said police spokesman Taufik Sugiono.</TE>
<TE>   Sugiono acknowledged that the women may have been subjected to "a
bit of violence" but denied that they were sexually harassed.</TE>
<TE>   Police finished their investigation Friday and will hand the case
over to prosecutors next week, he said. U.S. officials in Jakarta,
the Indonesian capital, said that they were closely monitoring
Sadler's case and that a consular official recently visited her.</TE>
<TE>   Sadler's detention comes at a time when Americans appear to be
under mounting pressure in Indonesia. Two American schoolteachers
were shot dead in the Indonesian province of Papua on Aug. 31 when
their car was ambushed near the American-owned Freeport mine. Police
are investigating whether the attack was staged by Indonesian
soldiers seeking more money to protect the mine.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and the consulate in the city of
Surabaya were closed for several days this month because of a threat
of terrorist attacks. Americans have been told not to travel to the
popular area of Yogyakarta because of similar threats.</TE>
<TE>   In Aceh, where the women were detained, Islamic rebels have been
fighting for 25 years to establish an independent state. Thousands of
people have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter Sadler wrote from jail a week ago, she said she had
come to Aceh on vacation in the hope of finding a job with a local
volunteer health organization.</TE>
<TE>   "While going to a popular tourist island in south Aceh we were
stopped at a military checkpoint and harassed, beaten, and taken into
custody for reason unknown," she wrote. "We were refused calls to our
embassies for help and imprisoned for eight days without contact to
[the] outside world. We have been interrogated for hours, deprived of
sleep and food and denied medical care for our injuries."</TE>
<TE>   Sadler denied having any documents from the Free Aceh Movement but
said she held written accounts of civilian life in the conflict zone.
"The papers I had were only villagers' stories of their trauma being
caught in between the conflict here in Aceh," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The women were handed over to police after eight days and moved to
Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, where conditions improved.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief telephone interview Thursday, Sadler said police were
holding them in a converted office with a bathroom. "We're being
treated very well now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sadler described herself as "depressed" and said she had been
diagnosed with angina. She said she was being given nitroglycerin
tablets to treat it.</TE>
<TE>   Sadler said she did not expect to be released any time soon.
"We're being made an example of."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Winters, an associate professor at Northwestern University
who frequently does research in Indonesia, said it is common for
academic researchers to work here on tourist visas. He said he had
not bothered to get official permission to work in Indonesia since
1989.</TE>
<TE>   "The charges these two individuals are being held on are arbitrary
and outrageous," he wrote in a letter in their defense. "The clear
intent is to intimidate everyone at home and abroad that might want
to gather primary information in Indonesia or tend to those who are
harmed at the hand of the police and soldiers."</TE>

country's first free and fair elections, emerging from polling booths
with their thumbs dyed purple to prevent them from voting twice. The
legislative vote is the first under King Mohammed VI and is an
important step in the reform process he launched after the 1999 death
of his father, Hassan II.</LD>
<LD>   Although Mohammed has relaxed censorship and let political exiles
return, criticism of the king remains taboo. Past elections were
considered rigged and corrupt, but there were relatively few reports
of serious violations this time.</LD>

<LD>Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said mercenaries
directed by Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslim leaders and French spies
orchestrated the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in a plot to bring world
wrath on the Serbs. "They agreed to have this crime committed--to
abandon Srebrenica and to carry out this slaughter," he charged.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic is on trial at The Hague on genocide charges; one count
involves Srebrenica, Europe's worst atrocity since World War II. More
than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were slain after Serbian forces
overran a U.N. "safe area" in the Bosnian town.</LD>

<HD>Leaked Letters Offer Portrait of a Chatty Charles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>So what is Britain to make of a letter-writing prince with a loose
pen and some leaky pen pals?</LD>
<LD>   Front-page news, column by column alongside Iraq, is the
revelation here that Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, for
years has been dashing off confidential letters to some minister or
other in what is formally characterized as his mother the queen's
government.</LD>
<LD>   Were it not for the flourish of that single-name signature, and
the royal return address, letters leaked this week to the media read
a lot like something plucked from a mailbag of earnest and outraged
missives to the editor, of the sort beginning "Sir" and ending "Yours
faithfully."</LD>
<TE>   The prince who frets about organic food and modern architecture
puts pen to paper to get in his tuppence's worth about all manner of
matters, from military training and human rights to the hygienic
qualities of wooden vs. plastic cutting boards and the "depressing"
case of some flourishing horse chestnut trees that were chopped down
for fear that falling chestnuts would crack someone's noggin and
occasion a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I and countless others," wrote the prince, "dread the very real
and growing prospect of an American-style personal injury 'culture'
becoming evermore prevalent in this country."</TE>
<TE>   In another letter, written in February to the lord chancellor, the
prince wrings his hands over a law stopping volunteers from cooking
meals in old people's homes unless the Good Samaritans have taken
food hygiene courses.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet many of these sorts of volunteers are middle-aged ladies who
have cooked for their families for forty years without poisoning
anyone. In order to protect the elderly from a tiny, but theoretical,
risk a whole section of volunteers is in danger of being alienated."</TE>
<TE>   Such a "proliferation of rules and rights ... stifles initiative,"
Charles argues. The letters, which reveal a writer one columnist
called "an epistolary incontinent," are more impressive for language
than for original thinking. And, in fact, much of the public may tend
to agree with Charles on matters like hysterical litigiousness and an
excess of political correctness.</TE>
<TE>   His spokesmen declare that the prince is perfectly within his
rights to speak his mind, as he has for years to officials from both
the Labor and Conservative parties in letters that until now remained
confidential. His publicly expressed attitudes have been widely
quoted and occasionally savaged.</TE>
<TE>   At worst, the letters read like nothing more than the musings of a
well-educated, middle-aged man with a bit too much time on his hands.
So what's the front-page fuss?</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the fact that royals sell papers, the fuss is over
whether the heir to the throne is making himself--via his unique
shortcut to ministerial mailboxes--a royal lobbyist, overstepping an
unwritten but understood constitutional line.</TE>
<TE>   The Times of London reported that Queen Elizabeth II told Charles
she is worried about just that. If her son outlives her, he'll be
king of a constitutional monarchy, a man more politically manacled
than any gabby cabby driving down Kensington High Street. (The Times
editorialized that Charles is "in danger of becoming the cabdriver of
caricature.")</TE>
<TE>   King Edward VIII, before he abdicated in 1936 to marry American
divorcee Wallis Simpson, made some of his ministers uneasy when he
simply said during a visit with desperately poor Welsh miners,
"Something must be done." Even the passive voice was too politically
active. In 1649, King Charles I had his head cut off for setting his
will above Parliament's.</TE>
<TE>   If Prince Charles wants to be king, groused one unnamed minister
to the conservative Telegraph newspaper, "he's got to shut up."</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, says Dickie Arbiter, a lecturer and broadcaster who for
years was Buckingham Palace's chief spokesman. For one thing, these
matters are really social policy, not politics. And for another,
"this doesn't have any constitutional implications. He's not head of
state."</TE>
<TE>   The prince's spokesmen have said speaking his mind comes with the
royal job. "Part of his role," said one statement, "must be to
highlight problems and represent views in danger of not being heard."</TE>
<TE>   At least as compelling as the letters' contents is the question of
who leaked them, and why. Almost no suspect has gone unnamed. Did
some minister do it to embarrass Charles into stopping the volume of
royal ruminations? Did 10 Downing St. do it for some advantage? Did
Charles' own people do it, perhaps to show him as a concerned,
down-among-the-people fellow? Naturally, fierce denials all round.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the leak seems deliberate: The first stories
appeared Sunday, when about 400,000 protesters descended on London to
rally in favor of fox hunting, farming and countryside concerns that
they believe are under siege by government policies. Newspapers that
day reported the vigorously voiced support of the prince, who is said
to have joked that if fox hunting was banned, he'd just have to spend
his time skiing abroad.</TE>
<TE>   A message to Prime Minister Tony Blair that was leaked that same
day, in which Charles agrees with a farmer who said that "if we, as a
group, were black or gay, we would not be victimized or picked upon,"
now evidently turns out not to have been a letter at all but notes
from a confidential meeting between the two in April.</TE>
<TE>   Charles has been writing such letters for more than three decades,
Arbiter said. "Why should he stop just because a few of the letters
have been leaked? What he might do is think twice about what he puts
in the letter and secondly who he writes to.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it strange," he added sardonically, "that in those 30
years, only now are they being leaked?"</TE>

<HD>China Frees a California Man Imprisoned for 8 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Chinese authorities have released one of the longest-serving American
prisoners in China, a La Canada man who spent more than eight years
behind bars, largely unknown to the public even though his name
topped the list of citizens whose release the U.S. government sought.</LD>
<LD>   David Chow, 54, was freed Sept. 19 and put on a flight to Los
Angeles the next day. He had an emotional reunion at LAX on Sept. 20
with his wife, two sons and members of his church.</LD>
<LD>   In a telephone interview Thursday, Chow said, "What I want to tell
other people is, China is not ready yet for people to go there and do
business, not until they become more civilized, until they respect
human rights."</LD>
<TE>   Chow's release came a month before Chinese President Jiang Zemin
is to visit President Bush at his Texas ranch, and observers said
other high-profile prisoners might be freed before the Oct. 25
summit.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested in 1994 and sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges of
attempted fraud, Chow was all but forgotten in the Chinese penal
system, deprived of due process and abused in detention, he claims.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, there have been several highly publicized cases
of ethnic Chinese citizens or residents of the U.S. charged with
espionage and other serious crimes. After strong objections from
Washington, Beijing has released most of those detainees.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials initially viewed Chow's case as an economic matter,
not a human rights issue, and he spent six years in prison before
high-ranking Clinton and Bush administration officials began
negotiating for his release. Also in contrast to other cases, Chow's
family refrained from publicizing his plight until after his release.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of arbitrary detention and denial of due process, David
Chow's case is one of the most serious I've seen," said John Kamm,
head of the Duihua Foundation, a San Francisco-based human rights
organization. Kamm, who worked on Chow's case for many years, said he
was encouraged by the implications of the release.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that this experience can be put to good use in other cases
of parole involving Americans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chow's wife, Emily, said the strain of trying to raise their two
sons and maintain her career has been tremendous. The boys have grown
into adolescence without their father's care. David Chow's father
died in a Los Angeles-area hospital this spring without any knowledge
of his son's imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Chow's case illustrates how foreign passports can offer scant
protection for ethnic Chinese caught up in the local politics of
business disputes in China.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials "are always telling the whole world that they
abide by the law. This is a joke," Chow said. "Just look at my case."</TE>
<TE>   Chow had been working in the import-export business, traveling
between Los Angeles and Hong Kong. His troubles began when officials
and bankers from the northeastern city of Harbin contacted him
through mainland Chinese businessmen in Hong Kong. They asked him to
help them secure a billion-dollar loan from foreign banks to build
roads and stadiums for the 1996 Asian Winter Games. Chow said that
when Beijing authorities alleged improprieties in the loan deal, the
local officials tried to pin the blame on him, accusing him of
forging letters of credit.</TE>
<TE>   The loan application was never completed, and no financial losses
were incurred.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities detained Chow for questioning on April 14, 1994, and
formally arrested him May 27. He was held for two years before going
to trial, far longer than the six-month limit for pretrial detention
specified by Chinese law.</TE>
<TE>   Chow was held in Harbin, known for its frigid winters. The Chinese
Ministry of Justice said Chow suffers from hypertension, coronary
arterial disease, angina, cerebral arteriosclerosis and kidney
stones.</TE>
<TE>   Chow said the ordeal left him "stressed and depressed and
confused. I have nightmares sometimes." His family members said their
strong faith helped them through the experience.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had argued that Chow was eligible under Chinese law
for medical parole. Chinese officials offered no explanation for his
release. However, when Chow looked at his release papers Thursday, he
found that the arrest date had been changed from 1994 to 1987,
implying that he had served his entire sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Chow said authorities abused him while he was in detention.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit me and threatened me and asked me to say what they
wanted me to say, but I had to tell the truth, and that's why they
don't like me," he said, adding that he never made any confession.</TE>
<TE>   Chow also said that U.S. diplomats asked him whether he would
agree to admit guilt if Chinese authorities would expel him from
China after sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   "I answered: 'No, I'm innocent. Why should I accept any of the
charges?' " Chow recalled.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-year sentence is harsh for an economic crime and longer than
those of Chinese citizens convicted of major political crimes. During
Chow's detention, his family watched cases of other detainees with
ties to the U.S. receive publicity in the media.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart aches every time I see a Chinese prisoner released on
medical parole and flown to the United States, and I think of my
husband, the father of my children, who is denied the same
treatment," Emily Chow wrote to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in
January.</TE>
<TE>   The family agonized over whether to publicize the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Because David's elderly parents do not know of his imprisonment
[I fear it would kill them], and out of concern for my own sons'
health and well-being, I have refrained from going to the press,"
Emily Chow wrote in the letter, which was posted on the Web site of
the First Baptist Church of La Crescenta, www.fbclc.org.</TE>
<TE>   One friend with connections in China told the family that Harbin
authorities made thinly veiled threats to kill David if the family
made a wrong move.</TE>
<TE>   "I am greatly torn about what to do," the letter to Powell said.
"It seems that only when a hue and cry is raised in the press will
the Chinese government behave in a civilized fashion toward American
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of publicity, diplomatic activity on Chow's case
gathered momentum. In Washington, Powell raised the case with Qian
Qichen, a Chinese vice premier and senior foreign policy official, in
March 2001, just days before the collision of an American spy plane
and a Chinese jet disrupted Sino-U.S. relations. Powell raised the
case with officials again in August. In Beijing in April, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) hand-delivered to Jiang a letter calling for
Chow's release.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, U.S. diplomats had traveled to Harbin to visit
Chow in prison every six to eight weeks. Earlier this year, church
and family members visited him in prison and reported that his
spirits had begun to pick up.</TE>

<HD>Ferry Sinks Off Gambia; Hundreds Are Feared Dead</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DAKAR, Senegal</DL>
<LD>An ocean ferry capsized in a fierce Atlantic storm off West Africa
and plunged beneath the waves in minutes, trapping hundreds of
screaming passengers, and rescuers said Friday that more than 760
people were believed to have been killed.</LD>
<LD>   Just 32 people aboard the ship were known to have survived the
disaster late Thursday night, some by clinging to the sides of the
overturned craft. Senegalese Prime Minister Mame Madior Boye said
nearby boats brought the survivors to safety.</LD>
<LD>   "It was horrible, because we were hearing people screaming from
underneath," said one hospitalized passenger, Moussa Ndong.</LD>
<TE>   Dive teams recovered 88 bodies, said Mamadou Diop Thioune, a
coordinator of a French-funded marine center. Divers spotted a number
of corpses through the ferry windows and believed the as-yet
unrecovered passengers and crew to be dead, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Searchers waited as night fell Friday for the arrival of military
divers with equipment to cut into the ferry, he said.</TE>
<TE>   President Abdoulaye Wade, speaking briefly to reporters, pledged
an investigation. The state-owned Joola ferry capsized off Gambia in
the Atlantic Ocean en route to the Senegalese capital, Dakar. Gambia
is a small, strip-shaped country that partially divides northern and
southern Senegal.</TE>

<HD>S. Koreans Turn Out Forbidden Flag</HD>
<DH>Politics: For the Asian Games, one factory gets leave to
ignore Seoul's ban on North's banner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>The first time Kim Ho Gyung touched the North Korean flag, his hands
were shaking and his breath was labored.</LD>
<LD>   When he was growing up in South Korea, it wasn't just a violation
of the national security law to possess the flag of his country's
sworn enemy. It was more like blasphemy, Kim said, struggling for
words to describe the enormity of the sin.</LD>
<LD>   Now, not only does Kim have a North Korean flag, but he made it.
And in a factory built by his father, a staunch anti-Communist and
Korean War veteran.</LD>
<TE>   "Unthinkable!" Kim said. "In broad daylight, we're making the
North Korean flag!"</TE>
<TE>   The occasion for the breaking of the taboo is the Asian Games,
which will open Sunday in the South Korean city of Pusan. North Korea
is sending its largest delegation ever to South Korea to participate
in the sporting event.</TE>
<TE>   After much tortured debate, the South Korean government decided
that it would permit the North Korean flag to be flown with those of
the other participating nations.</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing dialogue between the Koreas notwithstanding, it is
still a violation of South Korean law to possess a North Korean flag.
But the South Korean government gave an exclusive, one-time waiver to
the Taegu-based Hyopshin Special Dyeing Co. to manufacture 122 North
Korean flags for the games.</TE>
<TE>   The flags are allowed only inside the stadium and at the hotel
where the North Korean athletes are staying. And the polyester
screens used to manufacture the flags were destroyed at the end of
the job to prevent any further, illegal flag production.</TE>
<TE>   Choi Hyung Ju, an official of the Olympic Council of Asia, said it
had asked the South Korean government to allow the North Korean flag
in keeping with "the basic principle [of the Olympics] that no nation
or people should be discriminated against because of beliefs and
ideology."</TE>
<TE>   But the Kim family of the Hyopshin factory has mixed feelings
about its role in the march of history.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, 43, describes himself as a "right-wing conservative" whose
hatred of North Korea was well honed by his experiences as a young
man patrolling along the demilitarized zone between the two
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The company was selected to make 30,000 flags for the Asian Games
in May, when it was unclear whether the standoffish North Koreans
would participate. When North Korea announced last month that it
would come, and the South Korean government approved the use of the
flags, Kim was contractually obligated to supply them.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that I should be proud that our company is making history,
but frankly I would have rather somebody else do the job," said Kim,
unfurling a roll of North Korean flags, which feature a red star in a
white circle against broad bands of red and blue.</TE>
<TE>   "We were tempted to try to import the flag from a third
country--Switzerland or China. But the procedures for importing North
Korean flags were very complex," he said. "We would have needed
special customs clearance. And the quality would have been different
from the other flags. We decided ... we'll just make it."</TE>
<TE>   Flag-making is a delicate business that requires not only steady
hands for applying dye but also the tact of a diplomat. Errors almost
always prompt official complaints from embassies.</TE>
<TE>   The flags for the Asian Games were already a headache:
Afghanistan's flag was evolving along with changes in the country's
government, and Kim could barely keep track of its progress. And to
avoid objections from China, the flag of Taiwan had to be replaced by
a special flag incorporating Taiwanese symbols with Olympic rings.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing was as difficult as making the flag of the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was terrified. Our hands were shaking.... The speed was
50% slower than making other flags," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   During the height of the Cold War, South Koreans could be arrested
for as little as owning a book that contained a picture of the North
Korean flag. Even wearing too much red could raise suspicion that one
was a Communist.</TE>
<TE>   The taboo over red has long since been shattered--in fact, fans of
the South Korean soccer team wear it as their team color. But the
flag remains strictly forbidden under Article 7 of the National
Security Law, which subjects "those who praise, encourage or
propagandize for anti-state organizations" to prison terms of as many
as seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Sang Hyon was only 20 when he was arrested in 1992 for
participating in a demonstration at Seoul's Konkuk University at
which students used hand-painted North Korean flags in support of
Korean reunification. He served 2 1/2 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to break the taboo back then," said Lee, who says his
conviction caused his family great anguish and cost him his dream of
earning a doctorate in history. He hopes the decision to fly the flag
during the Asian Games will lead to an overall lifting of the ban.</TE>
<TE>   The countries technically remain at war, having ended the Korean
War in 1953 with a cease-fire but not a peace treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that 60% to 70% of South Koreans approve of their
government's decision to allow the North's flag to be used during the
Asian Games but that they are more closely split on permanently
lifting the ban. Younger Koreans tend to be more in favor of the
flag--or at least less opposed.</TE>
<TE>   "People my age aren't allergic to the flag in the same way as the
older generation," said Choi Jong Hyuk, who at 28 is the youngest
employee at the Hyopshin factory. "A flag is a flag. What's the big
fuss?"</TE>
<TE>   Even Kim's father, who established the factory 20 years ago, seems
not to be as perturbed by the flag order as the family expected.</TE>
<TE>   The 72-year-old war veteran can no longer speak, the result of a
stroke. But when his son told him that the factory was printing North
Korean flags, "he could have made a face or pointed a finger, but he
didn't do that," Kim said. "He had an expression on his face as
though he was saying, 'Oh, how the world has changed.' "</TE>

<HD>Officers Charged in Mexico's 'Dirty War'</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The three were arraigned in connection with
the deaths of 143 leftists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>A military court charged three Mexican army officers this week with
homicide in the killings of 143 leftist activists and
revolutionaries, marking the first prosecution of soldiers for crimes
committed during the "dirty war" of the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Military Atty. Gen. Jaime Lopez Portillo said Friday that Brig.
Gen. Mario Arturo Acosta Chaparro, Division Gen. Francisco Quiroz
Hermosillo and retired Maj. Francisco Barquin were charged after
relatives and witnesses said the leftists were last seen in the
custody of soldiers decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecution of Acosta Chaparro and Quiroz Hermosillo, both of
whom are already in prison and on trial on charges of aiding drug
traffickers, could mark an important step in President Vicente Fox's
pledge to investigate and punish crimes of the past.</LD>
<TE>   The court's decision constituted a rare admission by the armed
forces that evidence exists that they committed human rights
violations while fighting small, violent leftist groups in the
Pacific coast state of Guerrero in the 1970s and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The three men charged could face sentences of 20 to 40 years if
convicted in courts-martial.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Have Next Move on Chessboard That Is Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>In the high-stakes game of political chess underway over the U.S. and
U.N. showdown with Iraq, the next move belongs to the scientists.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday and Tuesday, in a austere high-rise building here, Iraqi
officials will meet with chief United Nations weapons inspector Hans
Blix and Mohammed Baradei, the director of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, or IAEA, to discuss the return of the first monitors
as early as Oct. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Once they hit the ground, the key to a productive weapons
monitoring program in Iraq, say past and present inspectors, will be
a simple-sounding phrase: free and unfettered access.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't do effective inspection without access, you have to
have the right to go anywhere, any time," said Garry Dillon, who led
the IAEA's Iraq inspection team from 1997 to 1999. "If that right is
denied, you can't do your job."</TE>
<TE>   It also means access to Iraqi researchers, government officials
and documents to figure out how far along the Persian Gulf nation
might be in designing and building weapons. Valuable information
often comes from face-to-face interviews with scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Without that human intelligence, say former and present
inspectors, the international monitors' technical expertise,
laboratory analysis and more sophisticated technology are useless.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's meeting here at the IAEA's headquarters, while cloaked
in the neutral language of diplomacy and technicalities, will be the
first real indicator of Iraq's intentions. If the meetings go well,
it could bolster those who argue for delaying military action until
the weapons inspectors have a chance to do their job.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations imposed the weapons inspection program after
the 1991 Persian Gulf War to ensure that Iraq was disarmed of any
weapons of mass destruction. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime
complied to some extent during the 1990s but became increasingly
obstructionist before it barred the monitors altogether nearly four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The frustrations we had were enormous," said Richard O. Spertzel,
the chief U.N. biological weapons inspector from 1994 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Information from intelligence sources, scientists, commercial
satellites and intercepted procurement efforts suggests to Western
officials that Iraq has attempted to revive its three major weapons
programs--biological, chemical and nuclear--since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   There is little question that Hussein's regime would try to hide
at least some, if not all, of any weapons program it has managed to
rebuild. Knowing that, the inspectors say they have tried to map out
a plan that would allow them to determine if and when the Iraqis are
lying to them and to what degree.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going in well prepared, with a plan, and we never take
anything at face value," said Jacques Baute, the Iraq Action Team
leader for the IAEA. "We are thorough and suspicious. We expect that
the Iraqis have learned lessons from the 1990s and will do things
differently. But we will try a few new things as well."</TE>
<TE>   That said, how do the weapons inspectors proceed, what limitations
do they face and how successful can they be at finding well-hidden
programs?</TE>
<TE>   The last time inspectors were in Iraq, they believe that they
uncovered and destroyed much of the country's nuclear weapons program
but were less successful at uncovering its biological and chemical
weapons stores and labs.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with people familiar with the inspection program
acknowledge that there are particularly daunting obstacles in the
biological and chemical fields.</TE>
<TE>   If the inspectors return, there will be two teams. The IAEA
includes 15 scientists with expertise in all aspects of nuclear
weapon production. The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC, is responsible for disarming Iraq
of any chemical or biological weapons and ballistic missiles with
ranges of more than 93 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The two teams coordinate their activities. However, their ability
to locate weapons varies widely. Nuclear material leaves what
scientists call a "footprint" that can be picked up with the
increasingly sensitive equipment available for measuring radioactive
substances. Samples of air and water often carry telltale signs.</TE>
<TE>   New X-ray systems for identifying the presence of metals that are
characteristic of nuclear substances are now portable. That means
inspectors can do analyses in the field and quickly decide whether
more thorough follow-up inspections are necessary, said officials at
the IAEA.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical and biological lab technology similarly has been
miniaturized so that much of it is portable, but biological agents
and chemical weapons leave little in the way of footprints.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is roughly the size of California, and although a full-scale
uranium enrichment plant would be hard to hide from a satellite
photograph, a lab used for manufacturing the smallpox virus or
anthrax could be concealed in a hospital basement. It likely would
only be found if someone alerted inspectors to its presence.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope if someone knows something, they will let us know," said
Ewen Buchanan, UNMOVIC's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Information can come from defectors, tips or interviews with
scientists. Often, it takes a combination of all of those to find a
site. The previous biological and chemical inspectors combed
apparently innocent institutions--university labs, hospitals,
veterinary centers--to piece together a picture of a major weapons
program.</TE>
<TE>   "Without good human intelligence you can't do it; spies in the sky
won't do you a bit of good," said former biological weapons inspector
Spertzel.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to rely on clues, on interviews, on import information;
we interviewed suppliers of some of the raw growth material" for
infectious agents, Spertzel said. "But those sources have been milked
dry. So you're really dependent on intelligence information unless
you just get lucky."</TE>
<TE>   The predecessor U.N. agency to UNMOVIC had access to intelligence
from the world body's member nations. However, some information also
went back to the inspectors' own countries, and Iraq accused the
monitors of being spies for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   UNMOVIC was set up after inspectors left Iraq in 1998, with the
understanding that it would not give information it obtained to
individual governments. However, some former inspectors believe that,
as a result, less information is being exchanged between governments
and the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   The significance of intelligence was evident this week when
British Prime Minister Tony Blair released information alleging that
the Iraqis are using mobile labs to manufacture biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   "These could look like a large semitruck; there'll be no signature
on it--they could be parked at a warehouse. What are you going to do,
open every semitruck? I don't think so," Spertzel said.</TE>
<TE>   If the inspectors are to be completely effective against such
tactics, they will need time. However, an initial assessment of the
Iraqis' willingness to cooperate could be made quickly.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: The presence of inspectors impedes weapons
development.</TE>
<TE>   "Inspectors in the country make life very difficult for people
trying to pursue a weapons program," said Melissa Fleming, senior
information officer for the IAEA.</TE>

<HD>Fox Targets Graft in Mexico Oil Monopoly</HD>
<DH>Reform: In challenging PRI and union bosses, president
refuses to be cowed by strike threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>For decades, Mexico's ruling party was largely sustained by two
notoriously corrupt pillars of the oil economy: the state-owned
petroleum monopoly Pemex and the Oil Workers Union.</LD>
<LD>   Petrodollars flowed smoothly to the state and the party, thanks to
union leaders who used threats and violence to curb labor dissent. In
return, they were allowed to assign drilling contracts, often to
firms they owned, and to serve in Congress. Some threw lavish
parties, wore extravagant jewelry and wagered embezzled funds in Las
Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   To the dismay of democratic reformers, much of this monolith
survives. But two years after his electoral victory over the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, President
Vicente Fox has begun to challenge the core of its lingering power:
the axis of political and union bosses.</LD>
<TE>   Early this month, federal investigators charged three Oil Workers
Union leaders with diverting $170 million from Pemex to the PRI's
2000 presidential campaign. The union responded by threatening its
first strike in 65 years, a prospect that last week shook Mexico's
financial markets and weakened the peso.</TE>
<TE>   As Wednesday's strike deadline nears, however, the monolith is
cracking. The PRI is split, but its leaders refuse to support a
strike. And dissidents in the 92,000-member union, which long has
been a cornerstone of the PRI, are speaking out against the
threatened action.</TE>
<TE>   Pemex and union negotiators say they are now focused solely on
wage issues that were on the table before the recent indictments. A
strike could cause a new spike in worldwide oil prices, disrupt
petroleum exports to the U.S. and cripple Mexico's economy, but both
sides are optimistic about reaching an accord by early next week.</TE>
<TE>   Challenging the union and yet avoiding a strike would be a
landmark triumph for Fox, who was elected on a promise to end
corruption but, until now, had been reluctant to go after past
wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Seeks New Image</TE>
<TE>   By facing down a serious challenge to that effort, according to
the hawkish advisors who now have his ear, Fox is trying to shed the
image of an ineffective, over-conciliatory leader who shies from
political combat.</TE>
<TE>   Other aides have been warning the president for months that a
frontal attack on the PRI's corrupt legacy would unleash waves of
labor unrest and kill any hope of winning the party's support for his
free-market reforms. The PRI still controls major trade unions and
remains the largest force in Congress, where no party has a majority.</TE>
<TE>   But after talks between Pemex and the oil workers broke down last
week, Fox accused union leaders of using the strike threat as
"blackmail" to try to force a withdrawal of the indictments.
"Combating corruption," he declared Wednesday in unusually firm
language, "is not on the negotiating table."</TE>
<TE>   "Many redoubts of power in the area of corruption still remain in
our country," the president added, "but change is on the way."</TE>
<TE>   The charges against the oil workers are part of the Fox
administration's largest anti-corruption case, one that promises to
shed light on the inner workings of the world's eighth-largest
petroleum company and one of Latin America's richest trade unions.</TE>
<TE>   This year, prosecutors brought criminal charges against Rogelio
Montemayor, the last PRI-appointed director general of Pemex, for
authorizing the $170-million payment to the union. Montemayor now
lives in Houston, a fugitive from Mexican justice.</TE>
<TE>   This month's indictment, detailing the passage of the money to the
PRI campaign, names Carlos Romero Deschamps, the Pemex union boss;
Ricardo Aldana, the union's treasurer; and Jesus Olvera, a union
section chief.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower
house of Congress, launched an investigation of the three men to
determine, within 60 days, whether they should be stripped of
legislative immunity and sent to trial. Romero and Aldana are federal
congressmen; Olvera is a state legislator in Tamaulipas.</TE>
<TE>   In resisting the strike, Fox has won support from all three of
Mexico's major parties.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the PRI defended the unionists. Party leaders denounced
the criminal case as a weapon in Fox's campaign to partly privatize
Pemex. The company has been a symbol of Mexican nationalism since a
PRI government nationalized U.S. and British oil companies here in
1938.</TE>
<TE>   PRI Head Against Strike</TE>
<TE>   "The oil workers union is part of the PRI, and it is our
obligation to defend the union," Sen. Manuel Bartlett said this week.</TE>
<TE>   But party President Roberto Madrazo and other leaders have backed
away from the union leaders, arguing that justice must run its
course. To the chagrin of nationalists, Madrazo said he opposes a
strike because it would "prevent us from fulfilling our international
commitments to supplying the United States" with oil.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fox and the PRI are attuned to public opinion. In a survey by
the newspaper El Universal, 48% of respondents said fighting
corruption is more important than avoiding a strike, while 29% think
the opposite. Ninety percent said they wanted the accused union
leaders to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexicans want an end to impunity, and this has become a
galvanizing idea for Fox," said Denise Dresser, a Mexican political
scientist. "The PRI is learning a lesson: If it wants to gain
strength in terms of its political position, it cannot be viewed as
the party of corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Some oil workers have written "NO STRIKE" on their hard hats.
Unionists claiming to represent several thousand oil workers plan a
march in Mexico City on Sunday to protest the strike threat.</TE>
<TE>   Such dissent was swiftly punished in the old days. Mexican labor
law, which Fox wants to rewrite, still gives labor leaders power to
get employees fired from the workplace for defying union mandates.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of oil workers have marched in support of their
indicted leaders in 12 cities over the last two weeks. Some said they
were ordered to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the dissidents have openly voiced contempt for the indicted
union leaders, calling them Mafiosi. "The unions cannot remain the
last sector untouched if society is becoming democratic," said Marcos
Centeno, the leader of one dissident group.</TE>
<TE>   After the indictments, the oil workers upped their demands for a
pay raise to 15%, apparently trying to provoke an irreconcilable
dispute. Pemex first offered 5.5%. Fox, touring an oil facility in
Campeche state on Thursday, said negotiators would probably settle
for about half the increase the union seeks. Pemex workers,
privileged by Mexican standards, earn an average of $12 a day, plus
generous benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office, Fox has watched PRI lawmakers water down such
major initiatives as tax reform and an Indian rights bill. Two months
ago, in the face of machete-wielding farmers, he withdrew a
multibillion-dollar project to build a new airport for Mexico City on
their land in the village of San Salvador Atenco.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fox remains popular, these setbacks have given Mexicans a
sense that he is not in control.</TE>
<TE>   One official close to Fox said the president decided that it was
time to restore his authority and credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Congress Still Combative</TE>
<TE>   "If they remembered Atenco and thought his hand was going to
tremble, they were wrong," said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. "I believe that a series of internal decisions have now
been taken by the union and the PRI to hang up their boxing gloves."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean, the official added, that Fox can now get his
way in Congress. Madrazo, the PRI leader, has agreed to consider the
president's bill to privatize part of the energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   But divisions within the PRI, sharpened by Madrazo's opposition to
an oil strike, may have hurt the bill's chances.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say the turmoil within the PRI could weaken the
party in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "The PRI was never completely discredited," said Mexico City
pollster Daniel Lund. "There was a historic vote in 2000, but the old
party retains enormous power. Unless the fragmentation continues and
the PRI is reduced significantly in power, it's hard to imagine the
democratic transition in Mexico making a lot of headway."</TE>

<HD>Hamas Leader Survived Airstrike, Israel Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Israel confirmed Friday that Hamas leader Mohammed Deif survived an
Israeli airstrike that was aimed at killing him, as thousands of
protesters marched in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and across the Arab
world to mark the second anniversary of the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation.</LD>
<LD>   The attempt to kill Deif obliterated his car Thursday, killing two
bodyguards, wounding 35 bystanders and drawing international
criticism. Deif was wounded but was whisked to a hiding place after
treatment at a Gaza City hospital, Palestinian medical sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Hamas, an Islamic militant group responsible for many suicide
attacks in Israel, said it would avenge the airstrike. Thousands of
mourners clamored for revenge during a funeral for the bodyguards.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli Culture, Science and Sports Minister Matan Vilnai, a
former deputy military chief of staff, confirmed Friday that Deif was
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians and Arabs elsewhere in the Middle East took to the
streets Friday to commemorate the anniversary of the current
intifada, in which at least 1,570 Palestinians and 601 Israelis have
been killed.</TE>
<TE>   The protests were more subdued in the West Bank, where Israel
reoccupied most major cities in June after a spate of Palestinian
suicide bombings. Strict army curfews remained in force, though
hundreds of people defied them to march in Ramallah and Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, masked militants armed with rifles marched in
the Jabaliya refugee camp exhorting Palestinians to keep up their
revolt. Hundreds lined the streets to watch.</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, thousands of Egyptians protested against U.S. and
Israeli policies and called on Palestinians to fight Israel's
occupation with various means, including suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments, Israeli soldiers shot and killed an armed
Hamas militant, Mohammed Yarmour, 21, before dawn Friday in the West
Bank city of Hebron, Palestinian witnesses and hospital officials
said. The army said troops shot him after he opened fire as they were
approaching his house.</TE>

<HD>East Timor Admitted Into U.N.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>East Timor, the world's youngest country, became the 191st member of
the United Nations on Friday, just months after achieving
independence and three years after shaking off Indonesian occupation.</LD>
<LD>   Diplomats from around the world applauded, rather than formally
voted, to accept the tiny Southeast Asian nation, ruled by Portugal
for four centuries, as the newest U.N. member. The country's
president, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, commonly known as Xanana, vowed to
build a "tolerant and just" society from a community racked by
decades of violence and suffering.</LD>
<LD>   Gusmao, a former guerrilla fighter who spent seven years in jail
and under house arrest, and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stood
together under an overcast sky as U.N. guards hoisted the country's
black, red and yellow flag and a flutist played the Timorese national
anthem.</LD>
<TE>   Gusmao said later that he was preoccupied with the daunting task
of providing jobs, education and a better life for the estimated
800,000 people of East Timor, which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and
claimed a year later. East Timor was born May 20 as Asia's poorest
country.</TE>

<HD>Germans Remain in the Dark About 2 Men Stopped on Runway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Were the guys with the knife and toy pistol attempting to hijack a
Lufthansa airliner, or were they undercover police conducting a
security test? No one in the German government was willing Friday to
say for sure.</LD>
<LD>   Officials revealed that last Saturday morning at the Frankfurt
airport, two men appeared on the runway beside a Lufthansa jet bound
for Tel Aviv. According to German media, the men attempted to walk up
the gangway and into the plane. They flashed airport identity cards
and tried to brush past a Lufthansa security guard.</LD>
<LD>   The guard then reportedly stopped and frisked them with a
hand-held metal detector. One of the men had what was described as a
bowie knife strapped to his leg. The other had a toy pistol in his
belt. The men told the guard that they were part of a special airport
security team and informed him: "You successfully passed."</LD>
<TE>   The men--described as Arab-looking--hopped into a dark-colored car
with airport plates and drove off with two other men. They were not
stopped or heard from again.</TE>
<TE>   Frankfurt police said Lufthansa filed a report, but not until four
days after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a prank, a test or something criminal," said police
spokesman Peter Oehm.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe our employee and are taking the matter very
seriously," said Lufthansa spokesman Thomas Jachnow.</TE>
<TE>   The Transport Ministry, which is in charge of the airport, said it
wasn't sure what happened. "We don't know if this was a test. We
assume this," said Juergen Frank, a ministry spokesman. "The matter
is under investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Frank added: "All I can say is that it would be unrealistic that
these men show police identity cards, get back into the car and
disappear if they had wanted to hijack a plane."</TE>

<HD>U.S. and Britain Propose Tight Deadline for Hussein</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The sponsors of a toughly worded U.N. resolution
will try to win support for it from France, Russia and China over the
weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY and TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The United States and Britain are proposing a seven-day deadline for
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to agree to disarm and grant weapons
inspectors full access to previously restricted sites or face severe
consequences, U.N. diplomats said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed resolution also requires Hussein to hand over within
30 days of its passage a list of all materials Iraq possesses that
could be used for weapons of mass destruction, and calls for "all
necessary means" to be used if Iraq continues to defy the United
Nations.</LD>
<LD>   A Security Council diplomat described the resolution as "very
tough and very detailed." It finds Iraq in "material breach" of 16
existing U.N. resolutions and says the government must agree to
"full, final and complete destruction" of any nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons.</LD>
<TE>   The "or else" clause is the problematic part, though, and U.S. and
British emissaries visited Paris on Friday and will travel to Moscow
and Beijing over the weekend to try to win support for the tough new
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But disagreement is deeper than they anticipated, with Russian and
French leaders having rejected the initial draft and the Chinese
having expressed reservations in preliminary telephone conversations.</TE>
<TE>   The three countries--which along with Britain and the U.S. make up
the permanent members of the Security Council--have veto power over
the resolution. While they are not likely to block the measure,
diplomats say, they are insisting that weapons inspectors be given a
chance to search suspected sites before military force is used
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   When President Bush called French President Jacques Chirac from
Air Force One on Friday morning to ask for his backing, Chirac said
he still opposed the automatic use of force if Iraq fails to
cooperate with U.N. demands. Chirac urged Bush to subscribe to his
two-stage approach, which would first let inspectors search for
weapons and, if Hussein's regime balked, would require another
resolution to approve an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac told Bush that "this is the view of the majority of the
international community, given the seriousness of the decisions to be
taken and their consequences," his spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna,
told news services.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman planned to travel
from Paris to Moscow for talks today, a White House official said.
Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov on Friday expressed further
doubt about U.S. policy toward Iraq, saying there is as yet "no clear
proof" that Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. But he added
that it would be an "unforgivable error" to delay the return of U.N.
weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   China also reaffirmed its opposition to any military strike on
Iraq that does not have U.N. approval. Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in
Paris for meetings, said that "if the weapons inspections do not take
place, if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the
authorization of the Security Council, we cannot launch a military
attack on Iraq--otherwise, there would be incalculable consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Despite these differences, diplomats here expect the council to
reach agreement because of the enormous stakes involved. Beyond the
possibility of war in the Persian Gulf and its chaotic aftermath, the
future of the United Nations as a central player in international
crises may be on the line. When Bush came to the U.N. on Sept. 12, he
challenged the world body to pass the resolution and prove its
relevance--or stand aside for the U.S. to act alone. Friday, at a
Republican fund-raising event in Denver, he took a softer approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm willing to give peace a chance to work," he said. "I want the
United Nations to work."</TE>
<TE>   But he made clear that he wants it to work his way, and he wants
it to work quickly.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday that the
president believes a single Security Council resolution must "make
clear that Saddam Hussein is in violation" of previous resolutions,
"make clear what Iraq needs to do to come into compliance [and] make
clear what will happen if Iraq does not come into compliance."</TE>
<TE>   The draft resolution has a clear road map of the steps Hussein is
expected to take. If he fails to comply, U.S. officials say, that
should trigger military force.</TE>
<TE>   A European diplomat said that some nations, anxious to defuse the
confrontation and avoid war, will be working to soften the language
of the draft in hopes of gaining Iraqi acceptance. British and U.S.
diplomats, however, argue that only an extremely tough resolution can
head off military action.</TE>
<TE>   "The instinct of the council will be to keep the language soft so
that Iraq will accept it," said one Western envoy. "But you have to
have it hard in order to avoid a war."</TE>
<TE>   The most recent Security Council resolution to be negotiated in
capitals rather than at the United Nations was the act to authorize
force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, recalled Russian Ambassador Sergei V.
Lavrov.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not up to us here. I haven't even seen the text yet," he
said on his way out of the United Nations Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the hard work hammering out details won't start here until
next week, after presidents and premiers have had a crack at it. The
10 elected Security Council members haven't seen the draft text yet
either and probably won't get a copy until Monday, after the
consultations with the permanent five members have finished.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably read about it in the Sunday paper," said Irish
Ambassador Richard Ryan.</TE>

<HD>Give Inspectors Time to Act, Kennedy Urges</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Democratic senator sees no 'imminent threat.' Bush,
moving to build public support, says he's 'willing to give peace a
chance.'</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Democratic critics of President Bush's Iraq policy stepped up their
campaign Friday for more diplomacy before military action is
launched, while the administration battled to build public support
for a potential confrontation with the Baghdad regime.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), in presenting a comprehensive
case against armed intervention, called for the United States to give
U.N. inspectors a chance to find and disable Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "The administration has not made a convincing case that we face
such an imminent threat to our national security that a unilateral,
preemptive American strike and an immediate war are necessary," he
said in a speech to the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy's speech came as three House Democrats--including one from
California--spent the day in Baghdad to seek Iraq's cooperation with
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The heightened activity by the Democrats underscored the
increasing difficulty facing the White House in its push for a
congressional resolution that would authorize force against Iraq. The
resolution ultimately is expected to pass, but Democrats are becoming
more assertive in raising concerns about its wording.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld took to the road to
dispel doubts about the worthiness of waging war on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm willing to give peace a chance to work," Bush said at a
Republican fund-raiser in Denver. "I want the United Nations to
work." But he said he wanted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to "do
what he said he would do," a reference to Hussein's pledge in 1991 to
allow weapon inspectors open access.</TE>
<TE>   "But for the sake of our future, now's the time.... We must make
sure this madman never has the capacity to hurt us with a nuclear
weapon or to use the stockpiles of anthrax that we know he has or ...
the biological weapons which he possesses."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, during a fund-raiser in Phoenix, Bush referred
to Hussein as "a man who loves to link up with Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   As it pushes for congressional backing for a tough stance toward
Iraq, the White House also wants the U.N. to approve a resolution
that would allow the use of "all necessary means" to deal with
Hussein's regime if it balks at U.N. demands that it eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations on Friday, diplomats said the United States
and Britain are demanding that Hussein be given a seven-day deadline
after passage of a tough new Security Council resolution to accept
its terms for immediate disarmament or face severe consequences. The
conditions in the draft resolution include a call for full and
unfettered access of U.N. weapon inspectors to Hussein's palaces and
other sensitive sites that previously have been inaccessible.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed resolution also requires Hussein to hand over a list
of all materials that can be used for weapons of mass destruction
within 30 days of the resolution's passage, and calls for "all
necessary means" to be used against Iraq if it continues to defy the
U.N.</TE>
<TE>   A Security Council diplomat described the resolution as "very
tough and very detailed."</TE>
<TE>   The draft resolution is proving a hard sell with other key
nations--such as Russia, France and China--and growing dissent on the
home front can only complicate the administration's international
lobbying efforts.</TE>
<TE>   In Atlanta, Rumsfeld drove home the message that the
administration will continue its push against Iraq. "No thinking
person wakes up in the morning wanting to go to war," he told
business leaders. "But the American people must weigh the risk of not
acting."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's developments capped a week when what had been a muted
discussion on Iraq erupted into a louder debate, with more Democrats
complaining that the administration is not allowing enough options to
war.</TE>
<TE>   Former Vice President Al Gore, Bush's 2000 election opponent,
assailed the White House's position in a speech Monday in San
Francisco. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
angrily accused Bush of trying to politicize the debate on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Democratic efforts are now aimed at modifying the wording" of the
congressional resolution, said Ross Baker, a political scientist at
Rutgers University. "They want Democratic fingerprints on it in the
event the military campaign, when it comes and is successful, they
can claim partial credit. If it runs into trouble, they will be able
to say they sounded the cautionary note."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush was optimistic
the nation's "resolve to deal firmly with Saddam Hussein will soon be
echoed in the Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders and White House officials reported progress
on changes in the wording of a war resolution that would draw strong
bipartisan support.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democratic senators, including Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), were drafting alternative resolutions that would give
Hussein a last chance to comply with a U.N. disarmament effort before
the United States used any military force. A Feinstein aide said that
the senator has received about 15,000 phone calls and 3,500 letters
on the Iraq issue, with the overwhelming majority against a
unilateral, preemptive U.S. strike.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic-led Senate is expected to begin debating the
resolution next week, culminating in a vote the following week. The
Republican-controlled House is expected to take up the resolution the
week after next.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Kennedy cautioned that a unilateral U.S. attack on
Hussein could embolden Al Qaeda sympathizers and trigger an
escalation in terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "A largely unilateral American war that is widely perceived in the
Muslim world as untimely or unjust could worsen, not lessen, the
threat of terrorism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In urging the Bush administration to wait to see whether the U.N.
succeeds in requiring Iraq to submit to unconditional weapon
inspections and the destruction of any weapons of mass destruction,
Kennedy said: "What is to be lost by pursuing this policy before
Congress authorizes sending young Americans into another, and in this
case perhaps unnecessary, war?"</TE>
<TE>   He warned that a U.S. attack on Iraq, rather than stabilize the
region, could escalate, "spiraling out of control" and drawing the
Arab world into a "regional war in which our Arab allies side with
Iraq against the United States and against Israel."</TE>
<TE>   "And that would represent a fundamental threat to Israel, to the
region, to the world economy and to international order," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld argued that Hussein's weapon program is a threat worth
striking down first.</TE>
<TE>   He said that weapon inspections would never be an adequate
deterrent to Hussein's ambitions to build a nuclear, chemical and
biological arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Such inspections were "not really designed for a hostile
environment," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Saying preemptive action against a threatening foe had precedent,
he compared the situation to that facing President Kennedy during the
Cuban missile crisis. He said that just as Kennedy's blockade of Cuba
then may have forestalled a nuclear confrontation, so would a
military strike on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Kennedy prevailed because he did take preventive action,"
Rumsfeld said. " ... The last thing we should want is a smoking gun.
A gun doesn't smoke until it's been fired."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Sen. Kennedy also cited his brother's handling of the
Cuban missile crisis. "The United States prevailed without war in the
greatest confrontation of the Cold War," he said. "Now on Iraq, let
us build international support, try the United Nations, pursue
disarmament before we turn to armed conflict."</TE>
<TE>   The three Democratic congressmen who traveled to Iraq--Reps. Mike
Thompson of St. Helena, Calif., David E. Bonior of Michigan and Jim
McDermott of Washington--said they hoped to convince Iraqi leaders to
submit to U.N. weapon inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a combat veteran of the Vietnam War," Thompson said on CNN.
"I don't want us to use war as the first option ever."</TE>
<TE>   "We want every diplomatic effort made to resolve this without
war," McDermott told CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, former President Clinton, on a trip through Africa,
said the United States should give Hussein a last chance to comply
with a U.N. disarmament effort before using military force.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we ought to go to the United Nations," Clinton said on
CBS' "The Early Show." "I think we ought to get a tough resolution,
which basically says, 'OK, we'll take Saddam Hussein up on his
commitment to free and open and unfettered inspections and ultimately
to disarmament of these weapons of mass destruction.' And if he
doesn't comply in the beginning or somewhere down the road, then the
international community is authorized to use force."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Clinton argued, there could be "an enormous price" if
the United States and Great Britain invade Iraq without international
sanction. "Does this justify ... [the] Chinese someday taking action
against Taiwan?" he asked on NBC's "Today" show.</TE>
<TE>   Like Gore and Kennedy, Clinton also said that pursuing Al Qaeda
should remain America's top national security priority.</TE>
<TE>   But he hinted he was less concerned that a war with Iraq would
unacceptably distract from that effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time," he said on
ABC's "Good Morning America."</TE>

<HD>A Star's Complex Life and Mysterious Death</HD>
<DH>Profile: The relationship between basketball standout Brian
Williams and his brother was troubled long before its tragic end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON and LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TARAVAO, Tahiti</DL>
<LD>On the far side of the island, where few people live, snarls of mango
and breadfruit trees have been hacked away to make room for a marina.</LD>
<LD>   A man on the dock pounds his anchor into shape with a hammer,
sweating in the damp, tropical afternoon. Schoolchildren hurry down
to the water, chattering, laughing, eager for their sailing lesson.</LD>
<LD>   Once in a while, someone glances at the boat in the last berth on
the left.</LD>
<TE>   It lilts there on the tide, drapes pulled tightly across tinted
windows. Even the simplest details, a surfboard lashed to the bow, a
pair of sandals left casually by the cabin door, seem sinister
because of the yellow police tape garlanded around the deck.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 55-foot catamaran on which Brian Williams--he called
himself Bison Dele near the end of a celebrated basketball
career--was last seen in July.</TE>
<TE>   What happened on the boat is a mystery that has police baffled.</TE>
<TE>   This much is known: Brian was a man of varied moods and interests,
hardly a typical athlete. The 33-year-old walked away from the NBA in
his prime, forsaking millions of dollars, to travel the world.
Sailing was a new passion and he had been exploring the South Pacific
with his girlfriend and a hired skipper on his boat, the Hakuna
Matata--Swahili for "No Worries."</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the trip, his 35-year-old brother, Kevin, a
troubled soul who called himself Miles Dabord, joined them. According
to police documents and interviews with investigators, family and
friends, the relationship between the men was complex--and tested by
Kevin's frustration at living in the shadow of his successful younger
brother. At sea, Kevin reportedly grew moody and was constantly
smoking marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe old tensions flared; maybe the brothers argued about
something new. Authorities believe Kevin killed Brian and the others,
then dumped the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   The disappearances went unnoticed for weeks, by which time Kevin
had moored at Taravao and returned to the United States. He spent a
month on the run--posing at least once as his brother--before being
found comatose and nearly naked on a Mexican beach two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened at sea, local gendarmes and the FBI don't have
an eyewitness. So they have focused on the catamaran, scratching at
bloody traces and examining the blue-green hull, finding marks
perhaps caused by a stray bullet.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence may tell them when and how the victims disappeared,
but they doubt it will explain why.</TE>
<TE>   Equally Complicated</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 11, 270 pounds, Brian was agile for his size, talented
enough to rank among professional basketball's better centers. But he
was just as well known for reading Nietzsche and Camille Paglia, for
being alternately personable and aloof. Once, he suggested his team
deal with a losing streak by holding hands and singing "Kumbaya."</TE>
<TE>   Off-seasons were spent riding his bicycle long distances and
running with the bulls in Pamplona. He was an avid pilot. "Planet
Earth is my home," he said in 1996 while playing for the Clippers.
"That's all the home I need. I just wander the Earth. I am king. I
don't need a starting point. I don't need a destination."</TE>
<TE>   His brother was equally complicated. Kevin read incessantly but
never finished college, bored by schoolwork. He was tall and athletic
but slowed by asthma. His entrepreneurial ideas usually failed.</TE>
<TE>   As Brian continued to fund Kevin's plans, their mother, Patricia
Phillips, noticed a disturbing pattern. "This usually occurs after
one of his get-rich-quick schemes fails and [Kevin] turns to alcohol
to ease his disappointment," she recently told investigators. "Once
[he] cannot afford to live a certain lifestyle, he seeks out his
family or, more specifically Brian, to help him back on his feet.
Once Brian provides [him] with money, he leaves and is not heard from
until his next financial blunder."</TE>
<TE>   There was something else. Kevin took steroids for his ailment, and
Phillips told police: "The medication tends to alter his behavior to
an aggressive posture. He is capable of extremely violent behavior
when he does not get his way."</TE>
<TE>   A childhood friend disputes this portrait of Kevin as struggling
and bitter. Kevin could be warm and humorous, Paul White said, his
troubles a result of him "not being the most disciplined person in
the world, of being someone who was impatient with the college
process, and of being someone who had an entrepreneurial spirit."</TE>
<TE>   White added, "Some issues in one's life haunt a person and affect
the way they go about their life."</TE>
<TE>   Critical Difference</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were so similar, each broad-shouldered, with dark
eyes and a heavy brow that made them seem brooding. They shared a
love of books. But from early on, there was a critical difference.</TE>
<TE>   Brian began to shine as an athlete in junior high school. When
Kevin tried to keep up, the asthma left him gasping, often landing
him in the emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   Though he never complained, his mother sensed frustration. "You
could just see how it bothered him, just by how he carried himself
around the fields and courts where Brian was playing," she said. "He
internalized it too much, I believe, and that's part of the whole
drama between the boys."</TE>
<TE>   Patricia divorced Eugene Williams, a singer with the early rock
'n' roll group the Platters, when the brothers were still toddlers.
As teenagers, Kevin and Brian moved in with Eugene, and Brian
attracted national attention on the basketball court, averaging 18
points a game for Bishop Gorman High in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   During his junior year, he also proved himself to be more than a
typical jock. "We were just kids, but he was so much different,"
former teammate Matt Othick said. "He was so much more worldly."</TE>
<TE>   In the Othick household, where Brian spent several nights a week,
the men could usually be found in front of a television set watching
basketball. Brian preferred to sit in the kitchen with Othick's
mother, Sandye.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a painter," Othick said. "They would end up talking for
hours about art and travel."</TE>
<TE>   After a few years, Brian returned to his mother in California
while Kevin remained in Nevada. Kevin worked as a clerk at a
wallpaper store and parked cars at a casino. Brian had an impressive
senior season at St. Monica High in Santa Monica, earning a
scholarship to the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   When he left home, Patricia took a job as a software developer in
Palo Alto. Kevin soon joined her, attending junior college by day and
training as a computer operator on the graveyard shift.</TE>
<TE>   "In hindsight, his personality was that of a computer geek," White
said. "He was insular."</TE>
<TE>   Brian, for his part, grew disenchanted at Maryland and
transferred. At the University of Arizona, there were dominant
performances and inspiring emotional displays, but also lapses on
court that caused people to question his commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "He had different interests than a lot of the guys," said Matt
Muehlebach, Arizona's team captain for the 1990-91 season. "He would
make different comments about books he was reading. He was interested
in wines and cooking. I remember his apartment was right next to mine
and you could see there was some thought put into decoration. Me, I
had a big beer sign on the wall."</TE>
<TE>   When Brian left college early to play for the NBA's Orlando Magic,
team executives hired a private investigator to check his background.
Brian once quipped: "They thought I was gay."</TE>
<TE>   Dependency Issues</TE>
<TE>   Professional basketball meant a $4.6-million contract, money that
Brian was eager to share with his family. At first, that seemed like
a blessing.</TE>
<TE>   He told his mother to quit her job and finish up on her bachelor's
degree at UCLA. When she mentioned Kevin was taking classes too, he
told her: "Well, both of you guys go back to college."</TE>
<TE>   They rented a house in Santa Monica and, for the summer of 1991,
Phillips had her boys back. It was there, Brian found someone new.</TE>
<TE>   Serena Karlan had blue eyes and light-brown hair. Like Brian and
Kevin, she was the product of parents who divorced when she was
young. Like them, she was philosophical and searching.</TE>
<TE>   "From everything I've been able to learn about [Brian] and what I
know of Serena, how they both were most interested in following their
hearts, I'm sure they looked into each other's eyes and said `I know
you,' " said her father, Stuart Karlan, an executive who lives in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   A friendship blossomed, perhaps a diversion for Brian at a time
when Phillips says family life was falling apart. "My one son was
suddenly a millionaire, I was suddenly his dependent and my older son
was my dependent," she said. "It just didn't work out."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin was taking summer classes at UCLA before starting at Santa
Monica College and Phillips did not think he was applying himself.
Her nagging led to what she called "a defining argument."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin, sick of the criticism, announced he was quitting school to
return to Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could ever take that back ... I should have respected him as
a man and trusted that he could be responsible," Phillips said. "I
spoke to him as if he was still a child."</TE>
<TE>   Brian, meanwhile, was giving his mother a substantial allowance
but stopped communicating regularly with his family. Problems with
fainting spells and clinical depression sidelined him and, in October
1992, he took an overdose of sleeping pills. The intention was "to go
to the end and back, or to go to the edge and turn around and come
back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends say he seemed to recover quickly, getting back to his
lively and daring self, the guy who always wanted to take people
flying.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wanted to get me up in that plane and flip it upside
down," Othick recalled. "I told him there wasn't a chance I'd go
flying with him. I mean, the guy made me nervous driving around
Tucson. He'd do whatever he could to scare you, to get a laugh."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he kept in contact with Karlan, who was wending
through various jobs, ultimately landing in Minneapolis as a concert
assistant for the artist formerly known as Prince. Brian came through
town with his team in 1994 and left her a pass to the game. The
relationship grew romantic.</TE>
<TE>   "Serena was never boy-crazy, but she most definitely had a crush
on [Brian]," her father said. "Her heart was connected to this guy."</TE>
<TE>   She did not want to be a part-time girlfriend or, worse, a fling.
They broke it off, but family members say she carried a torch.</TE>
<TE>   'His Own Way'</TE>
<TE>   The next five years saw Brian shift from Orlando to the Denver
Nuggets and the Clippers, where he performed well but stayed only the
1995-96 season.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball insiders whispered about a bum knee; the team claimed
he aggravated the injury sky diving. After sitting out much of the
1996-97 season, he helped the Chicago Bulls to a championship. That
team included Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman and then-Coach Phil
Jackson, kindred spirits or, at least, colleagues who could deflect
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say he was a loner, but he did his own thing, went his
own way," said Tex Winter, a former Bulls assistant who followed
Jackson to the Lakers. "Phil could relate to him better than most."</TE>
<TE>   Still, when the season ended, Brian switched to the Detroit
Pistons for a seven-year, $45-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   Again, he played well--and was unhappy. A teammate recalls him
buying a huge aquarium, putting on a mask and snorkel and sticking
his head under water, just to get the sensation of being elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   At Christmas 1998, with the NBA season halted by a labor dispute,
Brian tried to get his family back together, inviting his mother and
brother for the holidays. But any goodwill engendered by this visit
was lost days later.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips went to Tucson to visit her ailing mother, Ezra Mae
Hickmon, and Brian decided to join her. He also paid for his aunt to
fly out from North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, Hickmon died.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was, Hickmon was a second mother to Kevin and when he
learned everyone else had been by her side, he felt left out.</TE>
<TE>   "He was angry Brian didn't offer to pay for him to fly down,"
Phillips said. "He was angry with me for not letting him know what
was happening. He told me, 'Mom, that's it.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was then Kevin began calling himself Miles Dabord, a nod to
jazz legend Miles Davis and his own grandfather. Brian had already
taken a new name, Bison Dele, to honor the Native American ancestry
and the last known African slave in his lineage. Neither of them made
a legal change.</TE>
<TE>   In the months that followed, Brian spoke to his personal
assistant, Kevin Porter, about stopping the occasional payments to
his older brother.</TE>
<TE>   "This is due to [Kevin's] consistent pattern of wasteful spending
and unadvisable financial ventures," police say Porter told them.
"Brian [is] tired of always bailing [Kevin] out of his problems, and
wanted [him] to take a more self-reliant approach to his life."</TE>
<TE>   Porter denies making those statements and Phillips insisted her
sons were connected. "There was never any doubt about their love for
each other, they were still bound by the brotherly bond," she said.
"That's what I assume brought them together in the South Pacific."</TE>
<TE>   Before that happened, Brian walked away from basketball and $35.5
million remaining on his contract. "I'm trying to find myself," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A college friend, Ahmad ElHusseini, owned a business delivering
water in Beirut. Brian joined him, reportedly investing $1 million
before moving on to India and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   In Australia, he lived in a truck that held two motorcycles and
two mattresses. And he pursued a new hobby: sailing.</TE>
<TE>   He also kept in contact with Karlan, who was in New York trying to
get started in real estate. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he called
and, according to her stepfather, Scott Ohlgren, said: "Come to me,
come get out of the dust and the dirt, the fear and the noise."</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old woman came for five weeks of sailing, then left,
saying she had bills to pay. As soon as she returned to America,
Brian sent her a $50,000 check with a note: "This is what I think of
your financial difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   He wanted her to join him on a longer trip to Honolulu. Karlan was
excited yet hesitant about committing. She told her parents she might
be back in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A captain and crewman were hired to help on the spacious boat with
its angled cabin and wide berths below deck. Every two weeks, Gael
Ohlgren received e-mail from her daughter talking about beautiful
beaches and expensive hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Karlan wrote, "A life dallying around in sailboats isn't for me,
but [Brian] is talking about maybe going back to the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ohlgren: "It sounded as if they were discussing their
future."</TE>
<TE>   In early May, telling family members he wanted to reconnect with
his brother, Kevin met the boat in Auckland, New Zealand. Brian did
not seem perturbed.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like, 'What's this guy doing here?' or 'My freakin'
brother has showed up,' " Porter said. "I was thinking everything was
cool."</TE>
<TE>   With another large man on board--Kevin was 6-8, 270 pounds--Brian
and Karlan felt crowded and flew ahead to Tahiti. At the same time,
the Hakuna Matata took on a more experienced skipper for the sail
north, Bertrand Saldo, 32, of New Caledonia.</TE>
<TE>   "He was well known among skippers ... very easygoing,
slow-speaking and a very good sailor," said Patrique Humbert, a
fellow sailor. "He was just doing his job. He got caught in a bad
story."</TE>
<TE>   'He Was Reviving'</TE>
<TE>   In the final weeks of his restless life, Brian appeared to find
what he was looking for.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of May, he and Karlan arrived unannounced at the
Sofitel Ia Ora, a luxury resort on the island of Moorea, west of
Tahiti.</TE>
<TE>   Their thatched-roof bungalow stood beside an azure lagoon where
palm trees rustle like wings in the breeze. Each morning began with
Brian running along the bleached-white sand and taking a long swim
while his girlfriend read or simply lounged. He befriended a staff
member, Teva Temaurioraa, a big guy with a ponytail and Polynesian
tattoos with whom he played soccer and Frisbee.</TE>
<TE>   One week became two, then three. The resort switched them from
bungalow to bungalow, any open spot, because they did not want to
leave.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, the couple was falling in love. "Big love,"
Temaurioraa said. And Brian was hatching a plan. He asked the staff
to help him find property on a mountainside above the resort. If he
could return to this place in the off-season, the prospect of
rejoining the NBA seemed more palatable.</TE>
<TE>   "He was"--Temaurioraa pounded his chest--"reviving."</TE>
<TE>   Things were not going as well on the Hakuna Matata. The hired
crewman, Mark Benson, later told authorities that Kevin was clumsy
and in the way. When the boat reached Tahiti, Saldo grumbled to a
friend, Jean-Marie Libeau, that "Kevin was a strange guy and he was
not easy."</TE>
<TE>   A more disturbing report came from Saldo's other friend, Humbert,
who told Karlan's mother, Gael Ohlgren, that Kevin was "a pain in the
butt and stoned all the time on that trip. He had even broken some
equipment."</TE>
<TE>   At the Sofitel Ia Ora, however, the staff saw nothing alarming
when the boat anchored and the crew came ashore to have drinks with
Brian and Karlan.</TE>
<TE>   The couple checked out on June 24, joining the others for the
short sail to Papeete, where they stocked up on food and gas.</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, Benson flew back to Australia and the boat's crew
notified authorities of a plan to sail to Hawaii by way of the
Marquesas Islands. On July 6 at 6:45 p.m., Karlan called Porter and
said: "We're sailing. Everything's cool." She handed the phone to
Brian, but the satellite connection went dead.</TE>
<TE>   They would not be heard from again.</TE>
<TE>   On the Run</TE>
<TE>   Because the Hakuna Matata crossed open stretches of water, hopping
from port to port, investigators have struggled to reconstruct the
first weeks of July. Witnesses give conflicting accounts. Satellite
phone records help chart the boat's path. By July 8, investigators
believe, Kevin was alone.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Papeete and went to the airport to greet his
girlfriend, Erica Wiese, who had come from Northern California for a
planned vacation. They sailed to the Pearl Resort on Moorea, where
the staff recalls them as quiet and aloof. It is not clear what, if
anything, Kevin told her.</TE>
<TE>   On July 15, Kevin took her back to Papeete for her flight home,
then continued sailing around the island's east coast. Near the town
of Hitiaa, he struck a coral reef and called for help.</TE>
<TE>   The boat ended up in Taravao, registered as the "Aria Bella," its
true name lightly painted over in white. Kevin, also going by an
alias, wanted the hulls inspected but the tiny marina did not have
the facilities to lift the boat.</TE>
<TE>   "We noticed him because he was so big," said Marc Norel, manager
of the nearby A'O Restaurant. "He was very quiet. He seemed very
calm."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin inquired about selling some wetsuits and witnesses later
told police they saw him tossing the suits out. On July 19, he
quietly caught a ride to Papeete and flew home.</TE>
<TE>   There, things began to unravel.</TE>
<TE>   In early September, as family members grew concerned because they
had not heard from the boat, Kevin was arrested for trying to buy
$152,000 in gold from a Phoenix coin dealer by signing "Brian
Williams" on a check from his younger brother's account.</TE>
<TE>   Police were suspicious but could not prove he did not have Brian's
permission to make the purchase. Also, no one knew for sure whether
the others were missing or simply at sea. It wasn't until a week
later that Saldo's friend Humbert, cruising the islands, spotted the
sleek catamaran in Taravao.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Kevin was on the run. He called his mother several times,
claiming innocence and threatening suicide. Talking to Wiese, he laid
out a version of what happened. There had been a fight between the
brothers, according to his story, which she relayed to police. When
the others tried to break it up, Kevin accidentally punched Karlan
and she struck her head, dying instantly. Saldo wanted to notify
authorities, but Brian disagreed. Another argument broke out and
Brian beat Saldo to death with a wrench.</TE>
<TE>   Then, according to this version, Brian threatened Kevin to keep
quiet. Kevin grabbed a gun that was on board and shot his brother.
For reasons he did not explain, he tied weights to the bodies and
tossed them overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Theories Abound</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, back on the island of Moorea, Temaurioraa asked:
"They're all dead, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Gazing at the blue, warm ocean, he figured it doesn't matter how
it happened. "In Polynesia, they believe that if you die in paradise,
you're soul stays like that," he said. "Maybe they are still in
paradise."</TE>
<TE>   The police are not so willing to let the matter go. Nor are they
persuaded by what Kevin told Wiese, especially because he later gave
a different story, involving pirates, to his friend White.</TE>
<TE>   "Does he lie to protect himself?" said Michel Marotte, chief
prosecutor for French Polynesia. "He is not highly credible."</TE>
<TE>   After interviewing witnesses and checking phone records, police
believe the killings were committed on July 7. Theories abound. Maybe
he shot them as they went scuba diving or drugged them before
throwing them into the water.</TE>
<TE>   The crime scene has been narrowed to an area near Maiao, a small
island between the larger islands of Tahiti and Raiatea. But even if
police knew precisely where to dive, the bodies have probably been
devoured by fish. Forensic tests are pending, and authorities hoped
to interrogate Kevin.</TE>
<TE>   Then their top suspect turned up unconscious on a Mexican beach
wearing nothing but tube socks. He slipped into a coma after
overdosing on insulin and neglecting to take his asthma medication.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, his mother requested he be taken off life support. A
chaplain read a benediction as family members prayed around the
hospital bed as Kevin clung to life. He died late Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of miles southwest, the gendarmes had returned to
Taravao, climbing back aboard the catamaran. As life returned to
normal, locals sitting down to a lunch of poisson cru at the cafe,
the search resumed for any small clue that might have been
overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the reconstruction of events brings us closer to determining
how they were killed," prosecutor Marotte said. "Maybe if we get
lucky we can get some answers, but does that tell us the whole
story?"</TE>

<LD>A Calabasas landscape contractor was sentenced to 21 months in
federal prison Friday for forcing laborers to kick back more than
half their wages.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Salke, 48, pleaded guilty in February to making false
statements to Caltrans to cover up the practice. From 1995 to 1998,
the agency awarded his company, Aztec Landscaping, contracts worth
more than $2 million to maintain highway interchanges.</LD>
<LD>   Salke's actions violated the federal Davis-Bacon Act, which
required him to pay his employees the prevailing wage of $24 to $29
per hour, Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael W. Emmick said.</LD>
<TE>   The laborers were paid the proper amount, but Salke arranged for
them to be driven to banks to cash their paychecks. He required them
to return at least half the money, Emmick said, resulting in net pay
of $8 to $12 per hour.</TE>

<HD>Crowded CSUN Sets Record for Enrollment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cal State Northridge officials say this fall's record enrollment of
32,596 is a compliment, but they acknowledge it comes with a major
downside: There is a shortage of classroom space.</LD>
<LD>   The campus is so much in demand that some students couldn't even
set foot on it this semester because the admission window closed
earlier than ever, part of a trend seen throughout the 23-campus Cal
State University system.</LD>
<LD>   "We're doing everything we can to accommodate the students," said
Louanne Kennedy, CSUN provost and vice president of academic affairs.
"We're even offering classes in conference rooms. If there's a space
available, we're going to use it."</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the high interest is an indication that the
university has become a "destination campus" rather than a school
where people go to seek transfer credits.</TE>
<TE>   CSUN set its previous enrollment record just last semester, with
31,681 students enrolling for spring classes. Enrollment was 29,092 a
decade ago, but dipped to 24,310 in fall 1994, after the Northridge
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   This session, nearly every classroom and lecture hall is full from
7 a.m. to 10 p.m., and classes are also being held on Saturdays and
Sundays. Many faculty members are taking on more students than they
had planned, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Some students didn't get into their first-choice classes, said
CSUN spokeswoman Carmen Ramos Chandler. And others couldn't get any
classes at all. Admission of first-time freshmen closed last
November, the earliest ever. Acceptance of lower-division transfer
applications ended in February, and the window for upper-division
transfer students closed in March.</TE>
<TE>   This semester, the campus also did not accept new students
applying for second bachelor's degrees.</TE>
<TE>   There's no relief in sight for the 2003-2004 term, Chandler said.
"This is going to be a real problem, not just for us, but for the
entire Cal State system," she said, adding that virtually every
campus is seeing record enrollments.</TE>
<TE>   The draw appears to be economic. More students--children of baby
boomers and immigrants--are graduating from high school.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to succeed in life. It's that simple," Chandler said.
"And with the economic uncertainty, more people are returning to
school to get degrees they never finished."</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Attempt to Kill Police Officer Surrenders</HD>
<DH>Crime: After several telephone calls to officials,
Huntington Beach man gives up.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach man who police say threatened to kill people at
random if authorities didn't stop searching for him in connection
with the attempted murder of a Garden Grove patrolman was arrested
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jacob T. Marchesano, 25, was taken into custody without incident
by Downey police about 1:30 a.m. in the 12800 block of Eastbrook
Avenue after investigators who had been in contact with him by
telephone were able to persuade him to surrender.</LD>
<LD>   Police say Marchesano was a passenger in a pickup truck that
Garden Grove Police Officer Pat Gildea pulled over late Monday for a
traffic violation. Authorities said Marchesano shot at Gildea after
fleeing from the pickup. Gildea wasn't injured.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the pickup was arrested on suspicion of attempted
murder of a police officer. Marchesano is being held in Orange County
Jail on suspicion of the same crime.</TE>
<TE>   The search for Marchesano intensified Thursday after he called
investigators and threatened to kill people at random if police
didn't "back off." He also threatened to kill a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Marchesano, who has a juvenile record of violent
crime, called them several times and sounded emotionally unbalanced.
It was in one such call that investigators talked him into giving up.</TE>

<HD>Cabin Owners Return to Ruins as Fog Cools Flames</HD>
<DH>Fire: San Dimas Canyon homes are found burned. Mount Baldy
Village appears safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL HERNANDEZ and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents returned to the charred remains of cabins in San Dimas
Canyon on Friday as cool, damp weather reduced the threat that the
vast Williams wildfire would invade Mount Baldy Village and other
mountain resort communities.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which had consumed more than 35,000 acres, was only 35%
contained, with full containment not expected until sometime next
week. But firefighters were increasingly able to beat back the
advancing flames, and for the first time since the fire broke out
almost a week ago, there was a widespread feeling of optimism.</LD>
<LD>   "I would say we're slowly getting the upper hand," said Mark
Struble, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management.</LD>
<TE>   Bruce Quintelier, a fire information officer with the U.S. Forest
Service, agreed. "Most of the threat to the structures in Mount Baldy
Village and other areas is significantly diminished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But if the mood in Mount Baldy Village was upbeat, the devastation
in San Dimas Canyon was grim.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 wood cabins had burned, with little remaining but
charred debris, masonry foundations, soot-stained stone fireplaces
and the wreckage of burned-out cars.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe, but it used to be really pretty up here,"
said Molly Holmes, 54, who lived in a rented cabin year-round with
her five cats.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes and some of her pets fled ahead of the advancing flames
Monday night, but she had to leave most of the possessions of a
lifetime behind. She returned Friday to salvage what little she
could: a brass dolphin figurine, a World War II artillery shell she'd
kept on her mantelpiece, some decorative stones she'd collected from
the dry creek bed below her cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "You lose the most important things, and those are your memories:
pictures, awards, ticket stubs to the theater," she said. "It's
devastating."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Paltsios, 48, lives in the only cabin in the canyon that
survived the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lucky man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Paltsios realized that his luck could run out. The hill above
his cabin was already beginning to give way, and he said a winter
storm could bring it down.</TE>
<TE>   "At the first sign of rain, this place could be a disaster," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the fire broke out Sunday afternoon on the east fork of the
San Gabriel River 10 miles north of Glendora, at least 72 structures
have been destroyed, according to the Forest Service. Most of those
were vacation cabins like those in San Dimas Canyon. Holmes and
Paltsios are some of the few year-round residents.</TE>
<TE>   No homes in Glendora, La Verne, San Dimas and other urban areas
threatened by the fire were lost, although in several cases the
flames came within a few yards. Officials said the improving weather
and the determined efforts of the more than 3,300 firefighters
deployed along an 11-mile front saved hundreds of houses that might
have been lost.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those firefighters were finally able to take a break
Friday, although they remained near the lines, ready to respond in
the event of flare-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Shutt, 20, a member of a Forest Service fire crew from
Mariposa, relaxed by a firetruck at Mount Baldy Village on Friday,
chugging Gatorade and thumbing through a copy of Maxim magazine.
Nearby, other firefighters napped, despite the buzz of chainsaws
clearing flammable undergrowth around buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been hanging out, waiting for the word," Shutt said.</TE>
<TE>   But the word to grab their fire tools and head back to the lines
never came Friday afternoon, and at fire headquarters, officials eyed
the weather forecasts with relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the firefighters are finally getting a break," the
Forest Service's Quintelier said.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters said an upper-level trough of low atmospheric pressure
began moving into Southern California from the north Friday, drawing
in an onshore flow of cool, moist air from the Pacific that blanketed

<TE>   The National Weather Service said a few light drizzles could fall
in the fire area today and tonight, with more clouds and fog through
Sunday. High temperatures in the burn area plummeted from the 90s
earlier in the week to the 60s and 70s Friday, and meteorologists
said overnight lows in the 40s and 50s were expected tonight, with

<HD>Indigent Care May Get Budget Boost</HD>
<DH>Health: UCI Medical Center, overburdened with poor
patients, says the county proposal to add $2 million isn't enough to
solve crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors next week will consider a
proposal to increase by $2 million the amount the county spends to
serve poor residents.</LD>
<LD>   But health-care advocates said the proposed budget boost to $47
million doesn't go far enough.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as UCI Medical Center in Orange, which serves many
of Orange County's poorest patients, is capping the services it
provides for the indigent, referring some to 24 other Orange County
hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   Medical center officials said they simply can't afford all the
costs and the budget proposal wouldn't solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "UCI is supportive of the county, but we have some reservations as
to how they're going to assist us with our ambulatory care problem.
We haven't seen a solution yet," said Cindy Winner, UCI's associate
director for outpatient care.</TE>
<TE>   With only 9% of the total hospital beds in the county, the medical
center handles 25% of poor patients, Winner said.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center was not reimbursed by the county for $10
million to $11 million in hospital services and $2.5 million in
physician services in the fiscal year that ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   County officials, however, said they are proposing several
programs that they hope will improve the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Under one of those programs, some poor patients would be evaluated
at UCI, then transferred to another hospital by a doctor's group
contracted through the county.</TE>
<TE>   "The transfers will be at UCI's discretion, giving them the
ability to reduce their caseload," said David Riley, a county health
official. "We feel it could significantly reduce their volume of
[poor] patients."</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Focuses on HMO's Duty to Its Patients</HD>
<DH>Court: Family claims Aetna is liable for a man's care after
he was sent to a nursing home, where he died. Insurer says he
received proper treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time Aetna U.S. Healthcare squared off in court against
Claremont attorney Michael Bidart, a jury came back with a record
verdict of $120.5 million against the HMO.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the adversaries began their rematch in a Los Angeles
courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is one being debated in Congress and statehouses across
the country: Can health maintenance organizations hand off
responsibility for medical care of their members and then avoid
liability if something goes awry?</LD>
<TE>   Bidart represents the family of Murray Rosenberg, a 79-year-old
Aetna member and cancer patient who, the suit alleges, died after
being discharged from a hospital prematurely and sent to a nursing
home that didn't treat him properly.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna contends that Bidart's suit is an unfair attack on the
structure of managed care programs for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, everyone feels sympathy for the family for what they
went through," said Kirk Patrick, Aetna's outside counsel, in opening
arguments to the jury Friday. "But the system, the access to care
that Aetna provided to him, did not fail Mr. Rosenberg."</TE>
<TE>   If Rosenberg's family wins, it will send a powerful message that
HMO contracts with doctors and hospitals don't "absolve HMOs of legal
responsibility for bad clinical outcomes," said M. Gregg Bloche, a
law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.</TE>
<TE>   Large verdicts often are reduced on appeal. A San Bernardino
jury's award of $120.5 million to the family of a deceased cancer
patient covered by Aetna was being appealed when Bidart settled the
case for an undisclosed, presumably lower, amount.</TE>
<TE>   But the initial headlines often are enough to send ripples through
the industry, sometimes changing companies' behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're an HMO executive, you badly don't want these cases to
end up in court," Bloche said. "Your worst nightmare isn't the
verdict; it's the publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Most lawsuits against HMOs don't make it to trial. Federal law
bars patients from filing state court suits against HMOs for damages
if they receive health benefits from a private employer. In addition,
many HMOs in California require members to settle their disputes in
binding arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Rosenberg's family was not bound by those
restrictions because he received his coverage through the federal
Medicare program for the elderly. About 5 million people are enrolled
in Medicare HMOs, which offer fewer choices for care but additional
benefits such as prescription drug coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The case is also unusual in that it is a dispute not over benefits
denied but rather over the quality of the medical care Rosenberg
received.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg, who had multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow,
was admitted to Citrus Valley Medical Center-Queen of the Valley
campus in West Covina on Dec. 7, 1999, to begin chemotherapy. On Dec.
15, after his fourth chemotherapy session, Rosenberg was transferred
from the hospital to Sunbridge, a skilled-nursing home in Covina.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg's nursing home stay was covered by his Aetna plan. The
nursing home operator, Sun Healthcare Group, also was sued but
settled its part of the case for $250,000; it did not acknowledge
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   One of Bidart's key allegations is that Rosenberg's care was
mishandled by a physician known as a hospitalist, a doctor who treats
patients only while they are in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer contends that the doctor discharged Rosenberg without
consulting his treating doctors or his family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous," said Rosenberg's son, Haskell, who works for an
insurance company. "As my family talked about it, we really believed
that this [lawsuit] had to be done.... We had to take action."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit contends that the hospitalist had a financial
incentive: He served as the acting medical director of the doctors
group that contracted with Aetna, and the group stood to gain a bonus
if it kept hospital costs under budget.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitalist was included in the lawsuit, along with two
physicians' groups, but Bidart said he dropped them from the case to
focus on Aetna.</TE>
<TE>   In a deposition, the hospitalist maintained that he acted properly
and that he had consulted with Rosenberg's doctors.</TE>
<TE>   At the nursing home, Rosenberg was not seen by a physician and did
not receive all of the medications prescribed for him, Bidart alleged
in his opening argument. Aetna claimed that he was seen by a
physician there.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that Rosenberg's condition deteriorated. He
returned to the hospital Dec. 20 and died Jan. 1, 2000, of congestive
heart failure.</TE>
<TE>   Bidart claims that Rosenberg died prematurely, alleging that he
was given a life expectancy of three to five years when the cancer
was diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna maintains that Rosenberg was a sick man who had kidney
problems, high blood pressure, heart disease and a long history of
bronchitis infections.</TE>
<TE>   Bidart won widespread attention for his last case against Aetna,
on behalf of a widow who claimed that her husband died of cancer
after being unfairly denied an experimental treatment. In awarding
its $120.5-million verdict, a San Bernardino jury concluded that
Aetna acted with "malice, oppression and fraud" and shortened the
man's life.</TE>
<TE>   This time, according to Bidart, his case will expose how HMOs
recruit Medicare patients to their name brand, then often cede total
control to doctors and hospitals--without any oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "In their mind, their job is over when they take the check in and
sign the contract to delegate authority to someone else," Bidart said
before the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna officials say the company maintains broad oversight over its
medical network but is not required to review every treatment
decision. Every action it took related to its Medicare program was
approved by federal regulators or governed by federal law, Aetna's
lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty fair to say the responsibility for medical decisions
should rest with the medical providers," Aetna's outside counsel,
John Swenson, said this week. "The responsibility for coverage
decisions, if we make them, should rest with us."</TE>
<TE>   By no means is Aetna alone in the way it structures its contracts.
Many HMOs pay medical groups and hospitals a set amount per month to
provide all the care required by patients. If the doctors and
hospitals have money left over, they earn a profit. If not, they post
a loss.</TE>
<TE>   The former head of the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration,
which oversees Medicare HMOs, said managed-care plans are trying to
have it both ways. They say they offer added value for seniors, but
also claim that they're not accountable for care that takes place
under their contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Their PR is all about better care," said Bruce Vladeck, now a
professor of health policy and geriatrics at Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York. "If they're going to claim to be providing
better care ... then they've got to be ... accountable for it."</TE>

<LD>In an odd twist over an issue that has divided Oxnard residents,
police are investigating allegations that signatures on letters
opposing a proposed vehicle processing plant were forged.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Art Lopez confirmed the investigation into letters
sent to the city's Planning Commission, although he declined to say
how many are under scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't really talk about it, because the matter is still under
investigation," Lopez said.</LD>
<TE>   The probe comes as the City Council prepares to decide whether it
should require a complete environmental study of the proposed Pacific
Vehicle Processors plant.</TE>
<TE>   The company is seeking to convert a vacant parcel south of Hueneme
Road into a plant where workers would prepare imported vehicles for
distribution to U.S. dealerships. The plan has been opposed by
environmentalists, who say the site is too close to the Ormond Beach
wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Munoz Schnopp, a consultant for Pacific Vehicle Processors,
conducted her own investigation of the letters, which she read
shortly after the city Planning Commission decided against requiring
a full environmental study of the project.</TE>
<TE>   "They just looked really strange," Schnopp said. "Some of the
signatures looked the same."</TE>
<TE>   All the letters arrived in pre-stamped envelopes of the same size
and type, she said. There were half a dozen different styles of
letters, all addressed to Marilyn Miller in the city's Planning
Department. None of them included addresses in the body of the
letter. All asked that the city conduct an environmental impact
report.</TE>
<TE>   Schnopp said she called about a dozen of the letters' authors, all
of whom denied having written or signed them. One woman told Schnopp
that the person who supposedly signed one letter had died months ago,
Schnopp said.</TE>
<TE>   Tino Cabrera, a local business owner, said he was stunned when
Schnopp called him.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time [she called], I wasn't even aware of this project,"
Cabrera said. "There are some people out there who have some nerve to
put out something with my name, and think they're not going to be
caught."</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera said the return address on the envelope is not his home
address and the signature on the letters is written in cursive style.
"I always sign my signature in print," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera reported the incident to police. Several others contacted
by Schnopp told her they had also called authorities, she said.
"Forgery is a serious offense," Schnopp said. "We don't know who's
responsible."</TE>
<TE>   An official with of one of the main opposition groups to the
project said he had no idea who signed the letters.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason for us to do this," said Alan Sanders of the
Sierra Club. "The people who work with us have worked for years to
establish credibility, and no one is going to sacrifice that for some
infinitesimal gain."</TE>

<HD>It's a Jungle Out There</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: An electronic Rally Monkey at Edison Field
has evolved into a phenomenon for the playoff-bound Angels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this game of superstitions--a game in which grown men resort to
silly rituals just to keep a streak going--there is one undeniable
rule: Don't mess with a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   So it comes to this, as Disney's Cinderella team heads into the
American League playoffs for the first time in 16 years: Its best
good-luck charm is a monkey.</LD>
<LD>   But who cares? The Anaheim Angels, who didn't exactly storm into
the playoffs, will need all the help they can get Tuesday as they
start a best-of-five series against the New York Yankees, a team that
has been to the playoffs every year since 1995.</LD>
<TE>   This is no ordinary good-luck charm. For one thing, it's purely
electronic.</TE>
<TE>   The Rally Monkey debuted two years ago when Angel staff members at
Edison International Field, on a whim, flashed canned video of a
monkey on the JumboTron with the words "Rally Monkey" superimposed.
The crowd cheered; the team rallied from a six-run deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a fluke that surprised even Disney's marketing masters,
the Rally Monkey evolved into an unofficial mascot--and a full-blown
phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Now, cheering fans wave stuffed toy monkeys in the stands. He's a
staple of video clips on ESPN's SportsCenter. Sports columnists are
listing him as one of the intangible factors the Angels have in their
favor. He has groupies, a banana drink named after him at a
restaurant near the stadium, and a Web site (www.rallymonkey.com)
where people leave messages proclaiming, "I believe in the power of
the monkey!"</TE>
<TE>   Angel officials soon realized they were onto something special and
hired a monkey that had appeared in the movie "Outbreak" and on NBC's
"Friends." They dressed him in an Angels uniform and ran him through
some stunts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the silliness of it is half the appeal," said Alex
Brewsaugh, 20, of Orange. "I mean, it's a monkey. It has absolutely
nothing to do with baseball or the Angels, but it just fits.... The
rest of the nation has no clue what we're doing. They're probably
saying, 'What are those people smoking in California?' "</TE>
<TE>   For those keeping track, the Rally Monkey's record through
Thursday is 56-41 lifetime and 24-18 this season. Not bad considering
the Angels call him out only when the team is losing.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rally Monkey's popularity has a downside. The Angels are
careful not to overexpose it--a lesson learned after they hired a
real capuchin monkey, brought it out to the field and celebrated the
Rally Monkey's birthday with a big, showy tribute. The Angels lost,
prompting pitcher Jarrod Washburn to accuse management of "making a
mockery of the game."</TE>
<TE>   The only other time a live monkey appeared at a game, the Angels
also lost. In a bow to superstition, Angels entertainment manager
Peter Bull concluded, "Maybe his place is on the video screen."</TE>
<TE>   So he lives only on the JumboTron at Edison Field. There also are
some unwritten rules about when he pokes his head out:</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have to be tied or losing after the fifth inning.
Beyond that, the timing is a gut call, perhaps like a manager making
a pitching change. Bull consults a few advisors, then decides.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a mascot," Bull said. "He's like a baseball player with
his specialty. He comes out when he's needed. He doesn't go beyond
his abilities. He's a role player."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard for Bull to say that without chuckling a little bit.
This is, after all, nothing more than a jumping monkey on a screen.
But there's a fine line between acknowledging its silliness and
respecting its power.</TE>
<TE>   And if it gets into the minds of opposing players, well, all the
better. The minute he appears, the fans go bananas. They chant,
"Rally Monkey!" and waving the plush animals high. "Some players hate
it and ignore it," Bull said. "Others, I don't know if they can
handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Mariners officials once joked about blasting Peter
Gabriel's "Shock the Monkey" over the loudspeakers, though they never
did. And after a series in July in Anaheim, Seattle Manager Lou
Piniella said he was happy he didn't have to see it again until
September.</TE>
<TE>   While it may seem like fun and games, those who track sports
marketing gimmicks say the Angels have inadvertently created a cult
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a brand and it's become a point of distinction for
the Angels at their ballpark," said Dan Migala, editor of Team
Marketing Report, which tracks sports marketing and sponsorship
information.</TE>
<TE>   Already, other teams have tried to imitate the stunt. The
Milwaukee Brewers last year launched the Rally Rabbit and the NFL
Indianapolis Colts created the Touchdown Monkey in their 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Neither has become wildly successful, proving that audiences can
be finicky.</TE>
<TE>   If there's one routine knock against Angel fans, it's their
lackluster cheering.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Not since 1979 have I seen the fans, like myself, so up for the
games," said Chris Thompson of Anaheim. "The Rally Monkey is a
wonderful thing."</TE>
<TE>   Is the jumping simian enough to lift the team past the Yankees?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely. Definitely," said fan Brewsaugh.</TE>
<TE>   But he's not taking any chances. "I've got four Rally Monkeys. I
have a nice little shrine in the corner of my room."</TE>

<HD>Federal Jury Indicts Officer in $3.5-Million Real Estate
Scam</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Authorities say Sergio Fernandez posed as an
attorney and advised home buyers to submit phony loan documents. He
now faces conspiracy charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury has indicted a Maywood police officer for his
alleged role in a sophisticated real estate scheme that bilked $3.5
million from a federal home loan program.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Sergio V. Fernandez was a key player in the
operation that involved 150 fraudulent home loans across Los Angeles
and San Bernardino counties.</LD>
<LD>   The 43-year-old Fernandez, according to authorities, would pose as
an attorney and advise unsuspecting buyers to sign loan documents
filled with phony information.</LD>
<TE>   Profits from the sales would go to Fernandez's alleged
co-conspirators, Joe Zamorano, 70; his son, Mario Zamorano, 38; and
Patricia A. Lopez, 55, according to the indictment that was unsealed
late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The operation, authorities said, ruined many people's credit, and
some were eventually evicted from their houses. "It was an elaborate
scheme," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Christine Adams. "Fernandez
counseled [buyers] to sign the documents and assured them not to
worry."</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez was arrested Sept. 18 while on duty. He and the others
were released after pleading not guilty and posting bail ranging from
$50,000 to $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez was indicted on conspiracy and wire fraud charges and
faces a possible 15-year prison term if found guilty. The other
defendants were charged with money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez's standing in the 27-member Police Department that
covers Maywood, a small city in southeastern Los Angeles County, is
unclear. Police Chief Bruce Leflar was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged scheme, which started in 1996, generally worked this
way, according to the indictment:</TE>
<TE>   Joe Zamorano or his son would buy homes in Los Angeles and San
Bernardino counties, then search, with Lopez's aid, for buyers to
purchase the homes at a higher price.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, a licensed real estate agent, would then steer buyers with
modest incomes toward a home loan program offered by the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the HUD loans, buyers were given down payment money
by the Zamoranos. Also, their mortgage applications were filled out
with false employment, income and other information to make them
appear eligible for the loans.</TE>
<TE>   At signing time, the buyers would arrive at one of Zamoranos' real
estate offices. There they would be greeted by Fernandez. Dressed in
a suit, Fernandez, authorities said, would tell them he was
Zamorano's attorney. Fernandez, a notary public, would then notarize
and sign the loan documents.</TE>
<TE>   Upon the close of escrow, profits from the sale would be forwarded
to the Zamoranos.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were alerted by a homeowner who said her daughter's
Social Security number had been misused by the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   A trial was scheduled for Nov. 12. The defendants' attorneys
declined or were not available for comment.</TE>

<HD>Can N.Y.'s Lessons Be Transferred to L.A.?</HD>
<DH>Police: Two NYPD veterans up for the chief's job would find
some similarities--and many differences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the three candidates for the Los Angeles Police Department's
top job are veterans of the New York City Police Department, and they
are promoting their experience as an advantage.</LD>
<LD>   To many LAPD loyalists, however, the East Coast experience of John
F. Timoney and William Bratton doesn't count for much. New York and
Los Angeles present distinct policing challenges, they argue, and
historically, the police departments differed in their approach to
crime fighting, institutional structure and political oversight.</LD>
<LD>   New York has a much larger force to draw upon, and the NYPD is
recording twice as many arrests per officer as the LAPD. In Los
Angeles, officers patrol far more territory and, on average, make
more arrests in serious crimes. In recent years the NYPD has been
lauded for its success fighting crime simply by mobilizing large
masses of officers.</LD>
<TE>   If Bratton or Timoney takes the helm in Los Angeles, said Greg
Berg, a retired LAPD commander, "they will be very much surprised to
find how few people they have."</TE>
<TE>   But a close look at both cities shows that some of those
differences have been blurred, in part because police work has become
more standardized, law enforcement experts say.</TE>
<TE>   For today's police officer, "the core job is portable," said Alan
Deal of the California Commission on Peace Officers Standards and
Training.</TE>
<TE>   Police leaders across the country have increasingly favored
simple, practical strategies for law enforcement that emphasize
accountability and data collection and can be applied anywhere, said
Berg. The prevailing view is, "If you are going to be a police
leader, you have to know about the fundamentals," Berg said. "That's
crime fighting, and leading police. Those are basic.</TE>
<TE>   "And if you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, public controversies and political change in New
York and Los Angeles have produced a kind of convergence between the
two police departments.</TE>
<TE>   Former LAPD Chief Ed Davis, long a champion of the LAPD, said that
a comparison of the two departments would produce a result closer to
a draw than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The cities that the departments represent reflect such contrasts
and similarities. New York has larger numbers of almost every ethnic
group, including Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   A larger proportion of Los Angeles residents are Latino,
however--47% compared with 27% of New York residents.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the non-Latino white population has declined to
30% of the total, according to the most recent U.S. census figures.
But New York is not far behind at 35%.</TE>
<TE>   New York has a higher percentage of black residents--24% compared
with Los Angeles' 11%. Both cities are about 10% Asian. Los Angeles'
police force appears to be more ethnically diverse than New York's,
and closer to parity with the city's population.</TE>
<TE>   The proportion of foreign-born populations of both cities is
comparable, with Los Angeles' slightly higher. But immigrants from
the Americas, particularly Central America, predominate in Los
Angeles, while New York draws more from the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Economically, according to the census, the two cities are nearly
even. The median income in Los Angeles is $36,687, compared with New
York's $38,293. And in both cities, just under one-fifth of residents
live on incomes that fall below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking difference is how close together people live.
New York is nearly 3 1/2 times as dense, with more than 200,000
people per square mile in some neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, criminologists have equated crowding with high
crime rates, an axiom that has been challenged in New York in the
1990s, said Robert McCrie, chairman of the Department of Law, Police
Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the assumption people have worked on," he said. "But it
needn't be that way."</TE>
<TE>   New York's vast police force dwarfs Los Angeles'. The NYPD has
38,000 officers, compared with 9,025 in Los Angeles, and the NYPD
patrols a much smaller--though more vertical--terrain.</TE>
<TE>   There are 209 residents per officer in New York, compared with 409
per officer in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There are more officers per square mile in New York--127 compared
with 19 in Los Angeles. Dozens of New York City stations are within
walking distance of one another; Los Angeles stations police areas
from 4 1/2 to 65 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   Those differences bear directly on policing tactics.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, saturating an area with police officers to ward off
crime through police presence is much easier. As one LAPD insider put
it, when the NYPD has a problem, they can "trample" it.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, by contrast, the department's long-standing
reputation for aggressive policing was in part a consequence of the
relatively sparse LAPD presence.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of officers meant that, tactically, the LAPD had to create
the impression of force.</TE>
<TE>   Today, LAPD commanders speak with amazement and envy of the
ability of the NYPD to deploy hundreds of uniformed officers to a
single neighborhood when the need arises.</TE>
<TE>   "They move complements of 1,000 officers into one area where they
have a spike in crime," said LAPD Capt. Mike Downing of the Hollywood
station. "We move a platoon of 25 officers in from Metro."</TE>
<TE>   In part because of its greater numbers, the NYPD was able to stage
what McCrie calls a renaissance of policing in the 1990s. New York
today is considered a relatively safe city. The latest figures show
New York below Los Angeles in all categories of violent crime except
robbery, which is about the same in both cities.</TE>
<TE>   The NYPD's philosophy, McCrie said, is to keep patrols relatively
thin, while maintaining the capacity to quickly mobilize a huge
police presence at large public gatherings or disturbances.</TE>
<TE>   To maintain such a massive force, New York buys its officers more
cheaply, allowing the city to get more police officers for less cost.
Starting salaries for an NYPD officer are 70% of an LAPD officer's.
There is also a large gap at the top of the salary range, with LAPD
officers earning considerably more.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officers are slightly upper-middle-class: Their starting
salaries are well above the local median household income. In
contrast, the NYPD's salaries remain a little below, making the
police force slightly lower-middle-class.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has long thought of itself as an exceptionally lean, busy
and efficient police force, one that relies more on the
resourcefulness and skill of its officers than on raw numbers. LAPD
officials to this day maintain that their officers are more
hard-working than New York's.</TE>
<TE>   But recent statistics paint a different picture.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD receives about 365 calls per officer yearly, while the
NYPD gets about 311 per officer. But if Angelenos beat New Yorkers in
terms of demands made on their police, statistics suggest that the
NYPD is more responsive. An NYPD unit is more likely to be dispatched
in response to calls, and the NYPD sends out 117 units per officer
per year compared with the LAPD's 98.</TE>
<TE>   Given Los Angeles' vast distances and the relative sparseness of
the force, LAPD officers end up relying on a triage approach to
calls.</TE>
<TE>   On busy nights, they zoom among serious incidents at the expense
of less urgent calls--"chasing the radio," in department parlance.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, keeping response times from soaring is a constant
concern for LAPD commanders, and other police functions are eclipsed
by the pressure to keep response times in check.</TE>
<TE>   Along with a greater workload, LAPD officials have long prided
themselves on efficiency and high productivity.</TE>
<TE>   But FBI statistics from 2000 undermine that belief. Total NYPD
arrests rose during the 1990s in response to changes in police
tactics under former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, while LAPD
arrest rates, due to a combination of factors, fell.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, NYPD officers in recent years have made arrests at
nearly twice the rate of LAPD officers, jailing about 20 suspects per
officer per year, while LAPD officers arrest 11 suspects per officer
per year.</TE>
<TE>   But the LAPD catches the most serious offenders more often. In
categories of murder, rape, assault, robbery, burglary and auto
theft, Los Angeles officers make 2.6 arrests per officer per year,
more than double the 1.2 made by NYPD officers.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD spokesman Lt. Horace Frank said the difference reflects
deliberate policy. The LAPD and NYPD have approached quality-of-life
crimes in different ways in recent years, with the LAPD emphasizing
prevention over arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The 1990s saw other changes that served to smooth away the old
municipal differences.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the Los Angeles police chief was placed more
directly under the direction of the mayor, as has long been the case
in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Some saw it as an assertion of civilian control over the
department. But it was anathema to some LAPD insiders who treasured
the LAPD's traditional insulation from political influences.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in the academy in the 1940s, it was drummed into us
that we were a nonpolitical police department," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "You held your head high and you did what you thought was right,
regardless of what people thought. It became part of the culture of
LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   Recent changes have been to the department's detriment, Davis
said. But others, such as Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who will
select the next chief, seek even greater civilian control over the
LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most profound difference is that whoever is picked to
be chief in Los Angeles inherits a department subject to
extraordinary control by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the threat of a lawsuit, the city in 2000 made a series
of promises to reform the LAPD, including new measures such as data
collection to measure potential racial profiling, and an officer
tracking system to keep tabs on discipline.</TE>
<TE>   The promises are embodied in an agreement, called a consent
decree, under which the LAPD's promises of change are overseen by a
federal judge whose power extends into many areas traditionally the
domain of law enforcement executives.</TE>
<TE>   Neither New York candidate has had to deal with such a situation,
which represents a unique complication to whoever gets the job.</TE>
<TE>   The decree--an agreement between all parties to promote
reform--mandates a variety of new safeguards, auditing and tracking
functions within the LAPD bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Implementation is costly in terms of dollars and personnel, and
poses a host of tricky practical problems, including how to remain
effective in fighting crime while remaining in compliance.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the particular complexities of the LAPD, the primary
role of the new police chief--to fight crime and rally the
troops--will remain central to the new chief's job, said Berg, the
former LAPD commander.</TE>
<TE>   Despite contrasting backdrops against which they ply their trade,
police "still have to catch the bad guys," said LAPD Deputy Chief
David Kalish, adding:</TE>
<TE>   "East Coast, West Coast--the business of cops and robbers is more
similar than different."</TE>

<HD>Highflying Octogenarian Conquers the Waves</HD>
<DH>Great-grandmother rides hydrofoil water ski to Catalina
Island and back to publicize craft her son will be selling at Long
Beach boat show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In pearl earrings, apricot toenail polish and a black wetsuit, Mary
Murphy is the picture of graceful aging. At 84, she is about to ride
a modified ski to Santa Catalina Island and back, a 62-mile journey.</LD>
<LD>   Tall and athletic, she has an elegant bearing for a woman wearing
rubber. At the uncivilized hour of 7:30 a.m., she bobs in the chilly
water off Long Beach, signaling to the boat driver she is ready by
chirping "yoo hoo."</LD>
<LD>   She's perched on a seat mounted on a platform that resembles a
snowboard. Below the water, an attached hydrofoil helps elevate her
out of the water.</LD>
<TE>   She cruises by the Queen Mary at 20 mph and leaves the
still-sleepy downtown pleasure boat harbor behind.</TE>
<TE>   Five hours and 17 minutes later, Murphy has established a world
record for age and endurance, according to the World Flight Assn., a
Canyon Lake organization for hydrofoil enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond her glory ride in the solitary field of 80-somethings
riding hydrofoils was invaluable publicity for a big West Coast boat
show this weekend. Among the vendors at the Long Beach Convention
Center show will be her son, Mike, selling the Sky Ski on which she
set her record.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, Mary Murphy has done this trip by hydrofoil three times
before as an octogenarian. The Guinness Book of World Records did not
show up three years ago, the one time that someone called. Bob Brown,
a publicist for the Southern California Marine Assn., said the
water-ski world cares more about speed than the impressive stamina of
a great-grandmother who does not act her age.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy has had far more interesting ski trips to and from the
island. When she was younger, she, her husband and their four
children used to water-ski over for breakfast on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember the time we were skiing back and the shark hit the
engine prop and rolled over between us?" her son Mike asked last
week, recalling a trip 45 years ago when the toothy animal floated up
amid their water skis.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the kind of Murphy family trips one remembers.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an ordinary mom," said Tom Wolfe, who grew up with the
Murphy children in Compton and still water-skis with them weekly in
Long Beach. "If you can call anyone in the Murphy family ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's sons Mike, 54, and Nick Jr., 53, have won world
championships and now compete in seniors divisions. Son Patrick, 55,
was a champion power boat racer. Mike Murphy co-patented the Sky Ski
hydrofoil that Mary rode to Catalina. Only her daughter, Lee, 60, has
retired from the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Last month during a competition in Parker, Ariz., four generations
of Murphys hydrofoiled together--until the matriarch wiped out and
took down with her several family members along with costly boat and
ski rigging. She now has a trophy for "best crash," Patrick Murphy
noted.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great family stories is that after my sister was born,
the neighbor lady wanted to adopt her," said Mike Murphy, "because
she thought my mom carrying the baby on a Harley might kill her."</TE>
<TE>   This was back in Ohio, when Mary Murphy was a new mother. She had
met her husband at an aircraft plant where she assembled parts. "I
had to marry him," she said, "to get the Harley."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy grew up near the water in a small town in Wisconsin. She
didn't start water-skiing until she was 38, and living in Compton.
The family spent weekends at Long Beach's Marine Stadium, a Southern
California boat racing and water-ski mecca near Belmont Shore.</TE>
<TE>   Although they look similar, water-skiing is far more physically
demanding than what Murphy did Thursday to set her world record.</TE>
<TE>   The contraption she rode, patented by her son with a former
partner, has a seat with a lap strap. A board with painted flames
slides up and down a center post like a barber chair. At the base is
the shaped metal hydrofoil that remains submerged even while the
foiler rides several feet above the water.</TE>
<TE>   The hydrofoil dictates the rider's elevation, based on the angle
at which it moves through water.</TE>
<TE>   In "the hydrofoil community," as one Web site calls it, athletes
on wake boards can perform dramatic jumps, somersaults, back flips,
helicopter spins and even a new trick, the submarine, in which the
rider completely submerges.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of the world's top pro surfers has equipped his board
with a hydrofoil to help him ride mountainous waves.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest benefactor, however, is the water-skier who is
past age 20. That sport requires arm and leg stamina and strong
knees, which must absorb the bouncing of the ski against choppy water
or boat wake.</TE>
<TE>   With a hydrofoil, the rider is spared the wear and tear of
bouncing over waves. That's why Murphy can make the Catalina trip 75
feet behind a power boat and five hours later be ready to go again.</TE>
<TE>   Massive thickets of seaweed caused her to fall about 10 times, but
that only slowed her down. She had no problem waving like a pageant
winner as she neared TV crews on another boat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not tired," she said after her ride was over. "It gets me out
of the house."</TE>
<TE>   Her three oldest children and assorted spouses and friends were on
hand for her ride last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I told someone yesterday that I was getting up at 5 a.m. today to
go with my grandmother when she skied to Catalina and back," said
grandson Sam Murphy, 29, watching from a boat as Murphy gazed around
her at frolicking dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   "They were like, 'Whoooaa! What?!' I guess to everyone else it
would seem crazy to have your grandma do this. But I've grown up this
way. Every weekend my whole life we have always water-skied together,
and grandma barbecued hamburgers and hot dogs afterward."</TE>
<TE>   On the shore, an onlooker said what a lot of people were probably
thinking: "I hope I'm like her when I'm 84--my son sitting on the
beach with me after a day of water-skiing."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's oldest son, Patrick, replied with a grin: "Don't we all."</TE>

<HD>Rescued Sailor Has Arrest Record, but Says He Can't Recall
the Incidents</HD>
<DH>Saga: Vietnamese immigrant was not charged, and a Navy
spokesman says he has no reason to doubt the story of survival at
sea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was an irresistible story: A hearty Vietnamese immigrant is cast
adrift on his tiny sailboat in the Pacific on what was supposed to be
a short trip to Catalina. Scrounging for sea turtles and rain water,
the bedraggled mariner and his craft float for months before being
rescued by the U.S. Navy--300 miles off Costa Rica.</LD>
<LD>   Since his return this week, Richard Van Pham has become an
international sensation, celebrated in print and on television.
Supporters have offered cash to rebuild his life and sailboats to
replace his lost craft, the Sea Breeze.</LD>
<LD>   But the many questions surrounding Pham's past and his improbable
voyage have left some law enforcement authorities skeptical. Late
Friday afternoon--after completing another round of media
interviews--the celebrity castaway faced more than just questions
about the taste of seagull meat or how to navigate on the high seas.</LD>
<TE>   That's because law enforcement records show the 62-year-old
Vietnamese refugee has been arrested three times over the last 17
years on suspicion of various felonies, including aggravated battery,
as he drifted about the country. Pham was never charged.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted about his past by a reporter Friday, Pham reiterated
what he had been saying since the commotion erupted upon his return
Monday: He has amnesia from an accident suffered a decade ago and
cannot recall much of his past.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember," he repeated again and again, as he sat in a
downtown hotel room, paid for by one of the television programs that
plans to feature his tale. "The doctor say I lose my memory."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a clearly flummoxed Pham rose from his chair and
retreated to the hotel bathroom, declaring, "I'm very busy."</TE>
<TE>   It was a contrast to the beaming Pham who had relished his sudden
fame.</TE>
<TE>   He had been whisked to New York to be interviewed by Diane Sawyer
on Thursday morning, and his tale has also been featured on the other
major networks.</TE>
<TE>   "And now, when I come ... back to Los Angeles, everybody treat me
like family," a delighted Pham told Sawyer on ABC's "Good Morning
America." "I love it."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Walker, a Navy spokesman in San Diego, said he hadn't heard of
Pham's arrest history.</TE>
<TE>   "People have asked me, 'Do you believe his story?' " Walker said
Friday. "And I tell them, 'He's given us no reason not to believe
it.' We went on board, and there weren't any guns, there wasn't any
contraband, there wasn't anything to make us suspicious of any
activity."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's guided-missile frigate McClusky had picked Pham up
Sept. 17, his 26-foot sailboat disabled and the radio dead.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy housed and fed Pham for six days at sea, before turning
him over to U.S. State Department personnel in Guatemala, who helped
arrange for his return to Los Angeles, the Navy spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   He paid for the flight with $800 donated by crew members of the
McClusky, who adopted him and were charmed by his tale of life
adrift.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicious Immigration and Naturalization Service officers at Los
Angeles International Airport held Pham overnight to check his status
and be sure there were no pending warrants against him or convictions
that might subject him to deportation.</TE>
<TE>   An INS official confirmed Friday that when Pham arrived at LAX he
was carrying $4,000 in cash. He was released at the airport Tuesday
afternoon, after the INS could find no reason to hold him.</TE>
<TE>   Pham has told authorities that he has no relatives and has moved
frequently in recent years. No one reported him missing during the
months he says he was at sea.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear late Friday whether the new information, obtained
by The Times from law enforcement sources, would give pause to the
dozens of good Samaritans who have been lining up to give aid and
comfort to the apparently impoverished Pham.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it would not affect me," said Erwin Freund, a scientist in
Camarillo who wants to donate a sailboat to Pham. "If he is somehow
suspected of being a member of Al Qaeda, that's different."</TE>
<TE>   But Dana Emberson, a Los Angeles actor who had approached fellow
actors and others about raising funds for Pham, voiced reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "This turns from being a no-brainer into something I have to think
about," said Emberson.</TE>
<TE>   Pham's arrest record dates from 1985 and includes cases in Texas,
California and Florida. In each case, the records indicate that Pham
was not charged with a crime. Details of the cases were not
available.</TE>
<TE>   Pham's most recent arrest, according to the records, occurred in
May 1998 in Tampa, where he was picked up on suspicion of aggravated
battery with a deadly weapon--a felony--and stalking, a misdemeanor.
Prosecutors dropped the case.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Pham was arrested in Los Angeles in March 1993 on
charges of assault with a firearm. The district attorney declined to
file charges.</TE>
<TE>   And, records show that in 1985, Pham--under the name Rich Pham
Van--was arrested in Brownsville, Texas, on a felony charge of
marijuana possession. Again, there were no charges, records indicate.</TE>
<TE>   At least the most recent allegation, in 1998, comes after the time
when Pham has told reporters he was in a car accident that left him
in a coma and severely damaged his memory.</TE>
<TE>   Pham acknowledged Friday that he had once lived in Florida and
Texas, although he declined to provide details. When asked about the
arrests, he told a reporter, "Are you with the FBI? ... You sound
like the FBI."</TE>
<TE>   A television producer said that Pham's downtown hotel room has
been paid for through early next week--in anticipation of yet another
television appearance.</TE>

<HD>State Prosecutors Trying to Delete Spam</HD>
<DH>Internet: The attorney general's office hopes to use a 1998
law to save residents from annoying e-mail solicitations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State prosecutors are taking their first swing at curtailing the
daily barrage of unwanted e-mails received by California residents.</LD>
<LD>   They have sued a Los Angeles-area company, PW Marketing LLC, which
allegedly has sent millions of junk advertisements via the Internet
in recent months. The company and its operators could be fined at
least $2 million if the state wins, according to prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Other companies and individuals involved in the practice commonly
known as "spamming" are also under investigation, state officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   But Paul Willis, who prosecutors said is one of the operators of
the company, boasted Friday that officials could not hurt him.</TE>
<TE>   "They can shut me down. I don't care," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing they can do is get a civil judgment against me,"
he said. "I'm not dumb enough to keep any assets in my name," he
said. "Neither is Claudia," he added, referring to Claudia Griffin,
who is named in the suit as the company's co-operator. The two live
in Canyon Country, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals have used the state's 1998 anti-spamming law to
sue--sometimes in small-claims court--to stop unwanted commercial
solicitations. Friday's civil lawsuit against PW Marketing, however,
is the first attempt by Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's office to enforce
the law.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, unsolicited commercial e-mails must be
designated on the subject line with an "ADV" for advertisement or
"ADV:ADLT" for adult advertisement. They also must contain a
toll-free telephone number or valid e-mail address for consumers who
want to stop all future e-mails from that company, and firms must
honor consumers' requests to have their e-mail address removed from
their lists.</TE>
<TE>   Each violation carries a civil penalty of up to $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the statewide enforcement efforts, consumers are being
asked to forward illegal e-mails to the state attorney general's
office for possible prosecution. To help in their efforts, state
prosecutors have created a form on their Web site, ag.ca.gov/spam/,
for filing spamming complaints with the office.</TE>
<TE>   "Spamming is the scourge of the Information Age. It burdens the
Internet system, costs individuals and businesses an estimated $8
million a year and is extremely annoying to those who find their
e-mails clogged with electronic junk mail," Lockyer said in
announcing the suit. "In filing this action, we are sounding a
warning that we will track down and prosecute those who send illegal
spam."</TE>
<TE>   According to the attorney general's lawsuit, PW Marketing
solicited consumers to buy an online book called "Guide to the
Professional Bulk Email Business" for $39 that would provide readers
with information on "stealthing capabilities ... anonymous servers
... [and] anti-spam sites to see what the other side is up to."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege the defendants violated the state's spam law,
used a false address in advertising, failed to disclose required
information and engaged in untrue or deceptive advertising and unfair
business practices.</TE>
<TE>   Willis denied "most of the allegations," saying he hired another
company to send out the e-mails for him. He said he closed down his
company three months ago and that he and Griffin are getting out of
that business.</TE>
<TE>   The case was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court because
residents of that county alerted authorities to the alleged
violations.</TE>
<TE>   While state prosecutors are aware of many potential violators,
Deputy Atty. Gen. Ian K. Sweedler said a case must first be built. "I
had to find evidence that [the e-mails] were actually received by
residents in California," he said. "I can't file a complaint just
based on suspicion."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge in prosecuting such cases is twofold. First, the
evidence--e-mails most people delete without a second thought--must
be collected from dozens of consumers, establishing clear violations
of the law, Sweedler said. The second stumbling block is locating the
perpetrators and tying them to the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Most spammers use forged routing information to make it appear as
though they are sending e-mails from outside of the country when, in
fact, they originate elsewhere, Sweedler said. They also tap into
Internet service providers without authorization, making it more
difficult to track them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Sweedler said he got a break because PW Marketing
took orders from customers using a Canyon Country fax number. He
declined to say how many alleged violations he has gathered against
that company, but said the latest is dated Sept. 8.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the 1st District Court of Appeal in San Francisco
upheld the constitutionality of the spam law, saying it did not
burden interstate commerce.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, attorney Ira P. Rothken of San Rafael represented
the defendant, Friendfinders Inc., which was sued by Mark Ferguson
for allegedly sending him unsolicited e-mails that were deceptive and
misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Rothken said the law does not ban unsolicited e-mails but rather
requires senders to format the e-mails. The allegations against PW
Marketing, he said, "are much more serious than sending spam" because
they include deceptive business practices.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of activists involved in anti-spamming efforts,
Sweedler said, his office has received 100 to 200 forwarded e-mails
daily from consumers, for a total of about 6,000 to date.</TE>
<TE>   The office is seeking examples of spam received by California
residents and delivered via servers in California that give an
indication that the company is operating in California, such as a
local phone number or address.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has ended a probe into allegations that
Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas engaged in political
favoritism, intervened in criminal cases involving campaign
contributors and misused public resources.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer's action closes the books on the Rackauckas case and comes
the same week the Board of Supervisors decided to take no action
against the district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   "We looked into whether there were criminal deeds, and we found
none," Lockyer said in an interview late Thursday. "Our job is
basically completed."</LD>
<TE>   The attorney general, however, offered some parting
criticisms--and advice--to Rackauckas. Lockyer said the district
attorney made some "bad management decisions" and that his office is
beset with morale problems.</TE>
<TE>   "He suffers from a problem I've seen with judges who were used to
being kings of the courtroom--they aren't good team-builders,"
Lockyer said in an interview during a fund-raising reception in
Anaheim. "The smartest thing a politician can do is admit mistakes
and move on. It's too bad that hasn't happened."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said he was gratified by the decision and said he hopes
his staff can now move on.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that the attorney general is confirming this
matter is over and there is no evidence to support any criminal
misconduct," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's office assisted the Orange County Grand Jury in its
eight-month investigation of Rackauckas, which produced a report
accusing him of helping campaign contributors in three cases being
handled by his office, hiring politically connected job applicants
over better-qualified candidates and using public resources for
personal business.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has strongly denied any wrongdoing, saying the grand
jury performed an incomplete investigation and was swayed by the
testimony of his political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the accusations, Rackauckas has suffered little apparent
fallout from the grand jury report. The Board of Supervisors on
Tuesday considered the report but decided not to censure or even
criticize him. Instead, it voted to defer to the results of Lockyer's
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors said they couldn't punish Rackauckas or order
changes in his office because he is an elected official.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said he was happy with Lockyer's
pronouncement. Scrutinizing a fellow officeholder was awkward, he
said, because board members--many of them friends of
Rackauckas--couldn't independently judge the veracity of the
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the attorney general's responsibility to make the call,"
Spitzer said. "This has been a very unfortunate distraction that has
cast the district attorney's office and the D.A. in a bad light, some
of it his own making."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas critics were disappointed in Lockyer's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be very surprised and extremely disappointed if this
should turn out to be the attorney general's final pronouncement,"
said Devallis Rutledge, who resigned two years ago as Rackauckas'
chief assistant.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury accused Rackauckas of acting with an "appearance of
impropriety" but stopped short of accusing him of criminal
wrongdoing. One recommendation was that Rackauckas be barred from
hiring decisions--something supervisors and Lockyer said they had no
authority to do.</TE>
<TE>   Mishandled cases, said the grand jury, included one in which
charges against a domestic violence suspect were dismissed and one in
which an auto burglary suspect's 16 felony charges were reduced to
one misdemeanor. In each case, the report said, Rackauckas intervened
after he was contacted by a campaign contributor.</TE>

<HD>Remember Latinos, School Told</HD>
<DH>Education: CSUCI president gets some tough questions from
activists and others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its hot-pink walls, mismatched furniture and banners promoting
social revolution, the Cafe on A Street in downtown Oxnard seemed an
unlikely place for a meeting with a college president.</LD>
<LD>   But Thursday night, Cal State Channel Islands President Richard
Rush answered some tough questions from dozens of local educators,
activists and politicians who had come to air their grievances.</LD>
<LD>   They wanted to know what he was doing to increase the number of
Latinos on the school's faculty.</LD>
<TE>   They wanted to know why, in an area where so many high school
graduates are Latino, there was no Chicano or Mexican studies
department.</TE>
<TE>   And they asked how Latino students from economically disadvantaged
families could afford to attend the school without the state
Educational Opportunity Program, which offers grants and support
services to poor students. Rush did not try to argue about any of the
points raised.</TE>
<TE>   He was there, he said repeatedly, to listen, learn and ask for
assistance in making the appropriate changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a chance to build a university one time, and we don't want
to repeat the mistakes that were made in the past," Rush said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not done well so far. This has now risen to be a priority
because we must do much better."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Channel Islands--Ventura County's first four-year public
university--opened its doors last month.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Ventura County was the largest county in California
without a public four-year university.</TE>
<TE>   For years, county residents and officials had lamented the lack of
a hometown school, which forced the area's best students to go
elsewhere for an education.</TE>
<TE>   Now that they have the school, local residents are asking that the
college offer a curriculum that reflects the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a brain drain," said Steven Arvizu, former president of
Oxnard College. "Our young people leave and don't come back. If they
can get an education here, they may never disconnect."</TE>
<TE>   For months, Rodolfo Acuna, a professor of Chicano studies at Cal
State Northridge, has been fielding phone calls from educators
concerned with the direction the Channel Islands campus is going, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   There were not enough locals on the faculty, and many of the
Latinos on staff were administrators and not educators, they said.
Four out of the 30 full-time professors at Channel Islands are
Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a quality education for all students, but I want to ensure
that people of my own background have the same opportunity as anyone
else," Acuna said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the system; I know the games they play. At the very
beginning is when you make changes, because this is when you set the
template."</TE>
<TE>   The informal group of educators and activists from across Ventura
County began gathering at the Cafe on A this summer. They figured the
time was right to demand change.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to step forward and say the 'M' word," Cal State
Northridge professor Jorge Garcia told Rush, " 'Mexican '!"</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't our music, our art, our language, our culture seen as
something worthy of academic study?" Garcia asked.</TE>
<TE>   Rush promised to make the hiring of more Latino faculty a
priority. He said Chicano studies will be considered for addition to
the curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   And money will be found in the school's budget to fund the
Educational Opportunity Program, he said. "Tonight I've heard issues
of real significance to this community," Rush said. "I think we've
agreed to work together on this."</TE>
<TE>   Most in attendance said they hoped the discussion was the birth of
change at the school. "This is a good beginning; this is some good
dialogue," Garcia said. "We're not going anywhere."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Agribusiness giant Cargill Inc. said it will voluntarily recall about
400,000 pounds of beef after federal authorities linked it to an E.
coli outbreak that has sickened at least 56 people in the Midwest.</LD>
<LD>   The outbreak in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois came just days
after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, under fire for allegedly
failing to protect the public against E. coli O157:H7, declared "war"
on it and ordered all U.S. beef plants to adopt new safeguards.</LD>
<LD>   An investigation by the USDA found tainted ground beef from
Milwaukee-based Emmpak Foods Inc. the cause of at least 40 of the
illnesses in the three states. Excel, a unit of privately held
Cargill, purchased Emmpak Foods in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The company said it would not be a nationwide recall but would
involve a "handful of states."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops defended the American
church's toughened sex abuse policy, saying that most dioceses are
complying with the new plan and that critics are wrong to say it's
unfair to priests.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Wilton Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, also said those who have attacked the policy as a
public relations ploy are incorrect. The bishops have responded to
the problem of molesters in the clergy with steps grounded in
Catholic teaching, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The policy directs bishops to remove guilty clergy from all church
work and, in some cases, the priesthood altogether. It also includes
provisions that aim to make bishops more accountable for how they
handle molestation claims against priests.</LD>

<HD>Buffalo Focus of Terror Funds Probe</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Six recent arrestees are not accused of raising
money for Al Qaeda, but the FBI is studying the flow of dollars to
the Mideast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LACKAWANNA, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Sure, Hizam Mortade said, as he lugged two crates of tomatoes from
his truck into a grocery store, he sends money back to Yemen. He's
done it every payday since he came to the United States nine years
ago. The dollars are crucial to his family, most of all to his
mother, who has diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   And yes, he knows federal investigators are trying to track money
sent to the Middle East from this down-at-the-heels steel town,
fearing it may help fund the Al Qaeda terrorist network. "That's
crazy," he said. He set the tomatoes next to a pile of lettuce and
paused to explain why he thought so.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at Lackawanna," he said. "It's poor. We're all poor. The
reason we came to the United States was to make money to take care of
our families. Why would Al Qaeda, that has all the money in the
world, need our money? This whole town couldn't put together the
money to buy a single missile even if it wanted to."</LD>
<TE>   But federal authorities acknowledge that they have been
investigating western New York as a source of Al Qaeda funding as
part of an operation that on Sept. 13 resulted in the arrest of six
Yemeni Americans who, the government charges, were part of a
terrorist "sleeper cell" in Lackawanna. The funding probe, first
reported by the Buffalo News, involves the FBI, the Internal Revenue
Service's criminal investigation unit and the U.S. Customs Service
office in Buffalo, five miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of dollars flow annually from the Buffalo area, where an
estimated 5,000 Arab Americans live, to the Middle East, federal
authorities said. Most transactions are in cash because many Arabs,
including Yemenis, come from societies where banks are distrusted and
few citizens have bank accounts. The majority of the transactions are
legal, and, like Mortade's, are destined to help relatives back home.</TE>
<TE>   "Every immigrant community sends large sums home when they settle
in the United States, and Muslim families are not unique in that
respect," said Dr. Khalid Qazi, a Kashmiri, who is president of the
American Muslim Council's local chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "But since 9/11, cash transfers have been viewed with suspicion. I
tell friends, 'You've been here 20 years. Why are you still sending
cash, even if it's 100% legitimate? Cash is tainted. It's a habit you
ought to break. Use the banks.' "</TE>
<TE>   The focus of the government's probe appears to be what role, if
any, cigarette smuggling plays in financing Al Qaeda. One smuggling
scheme involving several local Arab Americans, some of Yemeni
descent, was broken up in 1999. The suspects were charged with
sending more than $1 million in illegal profits to Yemen. There are
no allegations that the six Lackawanna men--who are at the federal
detention center in Batavia, N.Y., pending a judge's decision on
whether to free them on bond--were raising money for Al Qaeda. They
are named in a criminal complaint for providing "material assistance"
to terrorists by attending an Afghanistan training camp in the spring
of 2001, well before the Sept. 11 attacks, for periods of 10 days to
six weeks each. They are not charged with carrying out or planning
terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder said he will rule by Thursday
on their attorneys' motion to free the men on bond, based on whether
he thinks they are a danger to the community or a risk to flee the
country. Their families have said they are prepared to post bail,
using their homes as security, if freedom is granted.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of emotions about this case," said Dennis O'Hara,
chief of Lackawanna's 51-member police department. "Frankly, if they
are freed, I am not sure I can guarantee their safety. From a
security point of view, they might be better off staying where they
are, in the detention center."</TE>
<TE>   The government remains tight-lipped about its investigation, and
the FBI and other federal agencies in Buffalo refer reporters'
questions to their headquarters in Washington. It remains unclear why
the arrests were made on Sept. 13, after the FBI had maintained a
high-profile presence in Lackawanna for weeks, or why they were
announced with great fanfare in Washington, coinciding with an
increased national security alert to level orange.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain things that still don't make sense," said
Rodney Personius, the attorney for one suspect, Yasein Taher, 24. "In
a normal federal criminal investigation, the FBI and others are
generally proactive, gathering the evidence, then charges are laid.
Here it seems the evidence is being gathered to support charges
already laid."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Taher, the suspects are Sahim Alwan, 29; Faysal
Galab, 26; Yahya Goba, 25; Shafal Mosed, 24; and Mukhtar al-Bakri,
22, who was arrested in Bahrain. Two other Lackawanna men named as
co-conspirators but not charged are being sought and are believed to
be outside the country: Jaber el-Baneh and Kamal Derwish, the alleged
ringleader of the cell.</TE>

<HD>Bush Boosts 2 Candidates in Teetering House Campaign</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president's unusual gesture shows the
importance he places on control of Congress. He has helped raise
$14.6 million in five days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>President Bush stumped in the West Friday on behalf of two Republican
House candidates--an unusual gesture by a president that underscores
just how tight the race is for control of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Bush appeared at three campaign events on Friday featuring two
Republican House candidates in open seats that political analysts
describe as toss-ups. The two districts--one in Colorado, the other
in Arizona--are new, reflecting the burgeoning population growth that
has moved America's voting power westward.</LD>
<LD>   The president has attended fund-raisers every day this week,
offering himself as the main draw at GOP events in Trenton, N.J. on
Monday, in Washington Tuesday and Wednesday, and in Houston on
Thursday. All together, he had helped Republican candidates and party
organizations bring in $14.6 million over the five days.</LD>
<TE>   Stuart Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, said Bush's
hectic campaigning, coming at a time when he is also deeply involved
in negotiations and preparations for a possible war on Iraq, is a
sign of the importance of November's vote.</TE>
<TE>   The president "is all over the place," Rothenberg said. "He's
campaigning for lots of candidates. It's hard for me to imagine that
he could be more all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 40 House races are considered competitive, and about two
dozen of those are close enough to be considered toss-ups, according
to Rothenberg.</TE>
<TE>   A loss of six seats would cost Republicans control of the House.</TE>
<TE>   In midterm elections, presidents generally focus their campaigning
on key Senate and gubernatorial races. But this year, House
districts--such as Colorado's 7th and Arizona's 1st--also have turned
into big prizes worthy of presidential treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg said recent polls indicate the two districts may be
tilting Republican, which suggests that the Bush visits are designed
to cement that trend. For Republican voters, Rothenberg said, a visit
from the president "reinforces the sense that these are winnable
races."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's first stop on Friday was a $1,000-a-plate luncheon in
Denver for Republican candidate Bob Beauprez. A former dairy farmer
turned banker and real estate developer, Beauprez is running against
Democrat Mike Feeley, a former Marine and lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   "You're backing the right man for Congress," the president told an
audience of Beauprez supporters, praising the candidate's business
acumen. "Bob's common sense approach is good for Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bush flew to Flagstaff to stump at a county fairgrounds for
Rick Renzi, a wealthy businessman and father of 12 who captured the
GOP nod in the new Arizona district. He is challenged by George
Cordova, who has enjoyed strong support from Latino and Native
American voters.</TE>
<TE>   Renzi "believes in family values," Bush said. "After all, he's got
12 kids."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Cordova has had trouble appealing to conservative
Democrats who may prove crucial in the race, Renzi's lead in the
polls has been fragile. His campaign has been damaged by allegations
that he is a carpetbagger--although raised in northern Arizona, Renzi
moved to Virginia in 1987 and only moved his primary residence back
to Arizona a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential visits can have spillover effects, boosting support
for other Republican candidates, and that was part of the White House
calculation for Friday's jaunts.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, incumbent Republican Sen. Wayne Allard is facing a
stiff challenge from Denver businessman Tom Strickland. With the GOP
hoping to overcome the Democrats' one-seat Senate majority,
Republicans can ill afford a loss by Allard.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, GOP gubernatorial nominee Matt Salmon is locked in a
close race with Democrat Janet Napolitano. Changing demographics have
made Arizona a more competitive state in recent elections, and Bush
would prefer a Republican in the governor's chair during the 2004
presidential campaign.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers for Cheney, GAO Square Off Over Records</HD>
<DH>Court: Agency wants details of energy policy meetings vice
president held. He has refused.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for Vice President Dick Cheney and for the General
Accounting Office each told a federal judge Friday that their clients
would suffer immeasurable harm by a ruling against them, as a
historic showdown between two branches of government got underway in
court.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney has refused demands by the GAO, the investigative arm of
Congress, to turn over records detailing who attended meetings of his
National Energy Policy Development Group, an advisory body that
helped formulate the Bush administration's energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   In nearly three hours of arguments before U.S. District Judge John
Bates, high-profile attorneys for each side urged the judge to view
legal theories and earlier precedents as critical to their individual
missions.</LD>
<TE>   The GAO also wants the vice president to explain why members of
the group, which included high-ranking members of the administration
and at least some energy business executives, were invited. The GAO
also wants to know when and where the group met, and what funds it
used.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, as chairman of the group, rejected the demands, saying the
agency has no right to such sensitive information from the executive
branch.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting confrontation is the first time in the GAO's 81-year
history that it has sued a federal official to gain access to
records.</TE>
<TE>   "The executive branch is asking the court to deal blows ... that
would be extremely damaging or fatal to the GAO's ability" to
investigate the executive branch, said Carter G. Phillips, the
outside attorney representing the GAO. He is a veteran litigator who
has argued 34 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said Title 31, the legislation spelling out the powers
for the GAO, mandates that it be able to oversee the expenditure of
public funds and how government agencies operate--including most
actions of the executive branch.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO's legal briefs say the executive branch has complied with
"countless" GAO requests for similar information.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips also pointed out that the GAO had dropped its requests
for transcripts and minutes of the advisory group's meetings in an
attempt to compromise.</TE>
<TE>   But Paul Clement, principal deputy solicitor general, countered
that the GAO was overstepping its authority in seeking
decision-making material. "They seek to compel the vice president to
give up documents that would show his and his closest advisors'
decision-making," he said. "This is unprecedented. It would allow a
revolution in the separation of powers."</TE>

<DL>NORFOLK, Neb.</DL>
<LD>A state trooper killed himself Friday in despair over botching a gun
check on a man who later allegedly took part in a deadly bank
robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Trooper Mark Zach committed suicide a day after three men stormed
into a local branch of U.S. Bank and fatally shot four bank employees
and one customer.</LD>
<LD>   Zach had stopped one of the suspected gunmen, Erick Fernando Vela,
on a traffic violation last week. At that time, he arrested Vela for
carrying a concealed weapon. But when he entered the gun's serial
number into a police computer, Zach transposed two digits.</LD>
<TE>   Had he entered the correct numbers, he would have learned that the
gun was stolen and Vela would have been charged with a more serious
offense that might have kept him in jail longer. As it was, Vela was
able to post bond after just a few hours in custody.</TE>
<TE>   After Vela was arrested in connection with Thursday's holdup,
friends said Zach was devastated. He killed himself with his service
revolver in a field outside Norfolk at lunchtime on a gorgeous fall
day.</TE>
<TE>   Zach, 35, left behind his wife and six young children and
stepchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the victims of the bank robbery also left behind children.
The fifth had married last month.</TE>
<TE>   "And so, tragedy compounds tragedy," Gov. Mike Johanns said.</TE>
<TE>   He was driving to visit the trooper's widow. To sit with her. To
pray with her. "There's not much more we can do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To see so much suffering. Those poor families [of the victims in
the bank] ... and now, one more added to the list," Johanns said, his
voice trailing off into the night. "So senseless. So very senseless."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were quick to note that even if Zach had flagged the
stolen weapon, Vela might still have been able to post bond quickly.
To assume that he would have remained in jail longer--or that the
bank robbery would have been foiled--is "pure speculation," said
Terri Teuber, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska State Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The weapon Vela was allegedly concealing when Zach stopped him
remains locked up in an evidence room. It was not used in the bank
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark, being the trooper he is, felt he had done something wrong,
and that's just not the case," the governor said.</TE>
<TE>   Zach was a 12-year veteran of the patrol force; he also served on
his union board. "An outstanding trooper," said Johanns, who had met
with him earlier this month on union issues.</TE>
<TE>   News of Zach's suicide hit hard after an exhausting, emotional day
of disclosures about the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Norfolk Police Capt. Steve Hecker said the holdup began with one
young man casing the bank. The scout then relayed
information--presumably about where each employee was stationed--to
his three accomplices by walkie-talkie, Hecker said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, they burst in through the double glass doors.
Within 40 seconds, they had shot all five victims in the head.</TE>
<TE>   "It went to hell," one of the suspects later told police.</TE>
<TE>   The three alleged gunmen were captured several hours later, in a
stolen pickup, as they stopped at a gas station 75 miles away.
Investigators found three handguns in the roadside weeds along the
getaway route, though they have not conclusively linked the weapons
to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth suspect, believed to be the scout, was arrested Friday
morning in Norfolk.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not recover any significant sum of cash from the
men, and Police Chief Bill Mizner said bank records were still being
audited to determine whether any money was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects were identified as Vela, who is 21; Jose Sandoval,
23; Jorge Galindo, 21; and Gabriel Rodriguez, 26.</TE>
<TE>   The men were led into a packed rural courthouse Friday morning for
a bond hearing. A Spanish-language interpreter explained the five
counts of murder each of them will face--charges that could carry the
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   A daughter of one of the victims wept.</TE>
<TE>   District Judge Richard Krepela ordered all four men held without
bail.</TE>
<TE>   As investigators tried to pull together the story behind the
robbery--which Hecker said had been in the works for at least two
weeks--Norfolk residents remained deeply shaken.</TE>
<TE>   The sign outside the U.S. Bank branch on 13th Street still flashed
enticements for loans and credit cards. But a police officer stood
somber guard outside the smashed glass door. And in the parking lot,
just beyond the crime-scene tape, mourners had left bouquets of
flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "People are in a state of shock," said Warren Cook, 86, a former
mayor. "It's very depressing to everyone."</TE>
<TE>   The locals are mourning, first and foremost, the victims. But
they're also mourning the small-town life their community has
outgrown.</TE>
<TE>   A onetime farm community, Norfolk struggled for years to attract
industry and jobs. It succeeded--but at a price. The town has grown
to an industrial hub of 24,000--and now finds itself battling drugs
and violence, prejudice and fear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad to see this [community] grow up to be a city. That's
what has happened, and we don't like it," said Tony Wortmann, 50, a
farmer and radio engineer. "We don't need these big-city problems."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's tragedy was of a magnitude all its own--the deadliest
bank robbery ever in Nebraska. Still, there have been four other
homicides in or near Norfolk in the last three years, all of them
drug related, Mizner said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen the violence increasing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lifelong locals tend to blame the crime on new arrivals drawn from
much bigger Midwest cities to jobs at Norfolk's meatpacking or
manufacturing plants. Many of the newcomers are of Mexican heritage,
but there are growing Somali and Sudanese populations as well.</TE>
<TE>   Just a dozen years ago, the town was virtually all white. Now, at
least 10% of the population is minority, said Mayor Gordon Adams, a
retired surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   The diversity has caused some tension. Schools struggle to hire
enough teachers for students who speak little English. Landlords
complain that foreign tenants need to be taught how to mow the lawn
and use the garbage disposal.</TE>
<TE>   But Norfolk also hosts an annual Ethnic Fair to celebrate the new
cultures settling into Great Plains life.</TE>
<TE>   And the Latino population, which has been in town the longest, has
begun to integrate neighborhoods and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Adams worries that such progress could be set back by the brutal
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   At least three of the suspects are longtime residents of the area.
All four are Latino "and that gives some of the people who are
prejudiced some ammunition, you might say," Adams said. "It fans the
fires of racial intolerance."</TE>
<TE>   Shopping at a Mexican market, a 47-year-old woman who was afraid
to give her name said that she too feared a backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, with this happening, they are going to treat us badly,"
she said in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "They already don't want us here," the store clerk, a teenager,
put in.</TE>
<TE>   "Relations weren't very good before," the shopper concluded, "but
now they're going to get worse."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street in her consignment shop, 64-year-old Carol Auen
said she gives the community more credit than that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the majority of us will be able to carry on good
relations," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But, Auen acknowledged, "there could be a few problems. Because
those men did do such a terrible thing--such a senseless, senseless
act."</TE>

<HD>Police in D.C. and Globalization Foes Clash</HD>
<DH>Protests: More than 600 activists are arrested as
demonstrations are staged ahead of weekend meetings of delegations
planning to discuss IMF, World Bank policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY TRICK, ARIANNE ARYANPUR and EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Phalanxes of police arrested more than 600 anti-globalization
activists Friday as finance officials from around the world gathered
to address the needs of their increasingly intertwined economies.</LD>
<LD>   As officers in riot gear clashed with hooded activists in the
streets, advocates of poor countries assailed the policies of the
rich inside the barricaded quarters of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Delegations from 184 nations will meet today and Sunday to review
the IMF's efforts to help countries in crisis and the World Bank's
programs to alleviate poverty in the developing world.</LD>
<TE>   The two institutions have become lightning rods for public
discontent about the increasing flow of goods, services, investments
and jobs across international borders. Hundreds of advocacy groups
have found common cause in their opposition to the forces of
globalization.</TE>
<TE>   The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a group that advocates
confrontational protest tactics, organized Friday's short-lived
effort to shut down the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of activists heeded the call. One group formed a
slow-moving bicycle caravan. Others set out on foot to block traffic
on major thoroughfares. More protesters gathered in a downtown park
to pound drums and stage a group "die-in."</TE>
<TE>   But their plans were largely thwarted by 3,000 police officers,
who corralled entire groups of protesters, dragged them off one by
one and placed them under arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Also arrested were several journalists and Greenpeace executive
director John Passacantando, who said he was riding his bike to work
when police stopped him.</TE>
<TE>   "They had no business in the street," Metropolitan Police Chief
Charles Ramsey said. "You can't just take over Pennsylvania
Avenue.... We took the action that was appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   No demonstrators or officers were seriously injured, Ramsey said.</TE>
<TE>   The first skirmish occurred about 7:45 a.m., when a black-clad,
masked protester spray-painted "class war" on the window of a Bank of
America office, and another threw handfuls of ball bearings through
windows at a nearby Citibank.</TE>
<TE>   A two-deep line of police officers penned in the protesters,
handcuffed them with plastic tie-wraps and herded them into a Metro
bus for the trip to central processing.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested another group of about 50 protesters outside a
Greater Atlantic Bank outlet, charging them with jaywalking and
blocking street traffic as they paraded down a main avenue blowing
bubbles and weaving webs of yarn.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic was stalled at several intersections as the marchers, many
covered in mud and wearing leaf wreaths, spilled into the street and
tied yarn around traffic lights.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Georgetown, protesters packed the sidewalks in front of
a Gap store to denounce the company's use of low-wage foreign labor
and clear-cutting of redwood forests. Half a dozen demonstrators,
mostly women, stripped to their undergarments and chanted, "We'd
rather wear nothing than wear Gap."</TE>
<TE>   "It was to create a bit of spectacle, but also to call people's
attention to the massive monster Gap has become," said Wahab
Al-Gatami, 33, who traveled from Colorado to participate.</TE>
<TE>   About 80 protesters took part in the bicycle procession, which was
trailed by a larger group of about 100 officers on bikes, motorcycles
and in cars.</TE>
<TE>   The bike riders eventually joined another group of protesters at a
downtown park.</TE>
<TE>   Later, officers on horseback and on foot surrounded the 300 or so
protesters and began arresting them one by one. Police used wire
cutters to separate their bicycles, which had been chained together,
and then loaded them onto a police van.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the IMF and World Bank compound, the United States, Europe
and Japan were attacked for adhering to protectionist policies that
undermine the economies of poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the sharpest criticism came from IMF and World Bank
economists, who issued a report detailing the cost to developing
countries of the subsidies, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers
imposed by wealthy nations.</TE>
<TE>   By restricting the ability of Third World countries to produce
goods for export, the rich nations exacerbate the very problems they
are attempting to address with debt relief and development aid, the
economists said.</TE>
<TE>   The average European cow receives about $2.50 a day in taxpayer
subsidies, World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern noted, while 75%
of the people of sub-Saharan Africa subsist on less than $2 a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hypocrisy to encourage poor countries to open their markets
while imposing protectionist measures that cater to powerful special
interests," Stern told reporters. "Rich countries should lead by
example."</TE>
<TE>   Oxfam America, a nongovernmental relief group, issued its own
analysis accusing the United States of creating depression-like
conditions in world cotton markets by paying domestic farmers to
overproduce. U.S. subsidies cost African cotton farmers $300 million
a year, Oxfam calculated.</TE>
<TE>   The financial woes of the developing world are expected to be a
central theme of this weekend's meetings. Global financiers are under
pressure to help Argentina find a way out of its economic morass and
to ensure that Brazil does not experience a similar fate. They are
being asked to deepen their commitment to Third World debt relief and
other poverty-reduction programs.</TE>
<TE>   Finance ministers from the Group of 8 industrial nations were
expected to consider proposals to improve their crisis response
capability, measure the effectiveness of development aid, and
restrict the flow of funds to terrorists. U.S. Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill said he would raise those issues during G-8 talks
that continued into the evening Friday.</TE>

<HD>Panel Proposes Cabinet-Level Chief to Oversee Spy Agencies</HD>
<DH>Espionage: Amid probe of Sept. 11 failures, the Senate
committee's plan would take control of the 13 organizations away from
the CIA director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The ranking members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said they
favor creating a new Cabinet-level position with authority over the
nation's spy agencies, stripping that control away from the CIA
director.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal--almost certain to face major resistance from
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld--has emerged as one of the
major recommendations lawmakers are likely to make at the culmination
of their investigation into the intelligence failures surrounding
Sept. 11. A final report from lawmakers is due early next year.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe that we need a chairman of the board, a CEO, of the
entire intelligence community," said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.),
the intelligence panel's vice-chairman, on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the intelligence committee,
also endorsed the idea, designed to end an often-criticized
arrangement in which the CIA director has little leverage over other
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA director is technically in charge of coordinating the
efforts of all 13 of the nation's spy agencies. But 85% of the U.S.
intelligence budget is controlled by the Pentagon and the Secretary
of Defense. As a result, lawmakers say, the CIA director struggles to
set agendas and control allocation of resources across the community.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the structure of these agencies will be affected by
homeland security legislation pending before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The idea to split the director's position has gathered new
momentum in recent weeks amid disclosures in congressional hearings
that numerous corners of the intelligence community failed to heed,
or sometimes even hear, warnings from CIA Director George J. Tenet
about the Al Qaeda threat.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, for example, Tenet issued a memo declaring "war" on Al
Qaeda and ordering that no expense be spared in the intelligence
community in the pursuit of the terrorist group and its founder,
Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional investigators found little evidence that the
memo prompted a significant mobilization. A preliminary report issued
last week said that in 2000, the CIA had just five analysts in its
counterterrorism center tracking Al Qaeda. The CIA later said the
actual number was nine.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, FBI agents interviewed by investigators said they
weren't even aware of Tenet's declaration, prompting lawmakers to
wonder whether Tenet had failed to follow up or whether the community
was too fragmented. For years, blue-ribbon commissions have
recommended strengthening the director's hand by giving him broader
control over intelligence purse strings. But the proposals have
always foundered, often because of opposition from the Pentagon,
which stands to lose control over billions of dollars of its budget.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby and Graham acknowledged that the idea will have an uphill
climb. The recommendation is likely to "stir up a lot of hornets,"
Graham said in a television interview Wednesday. "There will be
people who currently have that power who will feel threatened and
resist."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Rumsfeld has already moved to consolidate authority over
intelligence matters in the Pentagon. At his urging, the Senate
recently passed a bill creating a new position--the undersecretary of
defense for intelligence--that would oversee vast swaths of the spy
community, including the National Security Agency and the Defense
Intelligence Agency. The House has yet to vote on the proposal, a
Pentagon official said.</TE>
<TE>   Many intelligence insiders say Rumsfeld's move would erode Tenet's
position because many of his coordination responsibilities would
probably be absorbed by the new Pentagon undersecretary.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essentially a demotion" for the CIA director, said a former
senior CIA official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Pentagon and CIA declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to split the director into two positions also faces
practical hurdles. CIA directors wield influence in Washington
largely because of power and access that stems from their position
atop the CIA itself.</TE>
<TE>   CIA directors control the operations of overseas spies and are
responsible for briefing the president on information collected by
every other spy agency.</TE>
<TE>   A new Cabinet-level intelligence director wouldn't necessarily
perform those functions and could get lost in the burgeoning
bureaucratic trellis of homeland security, domestic law enforcement
and intelligence in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, "he becomes like the drug czar," said the former
CIA official, referring to a position often dismissed as a
figurehead.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Has Fulfilled Plea Deal, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Court: The 'American Talib' has cooperated, should receive
20-year term, prosecutors write.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh, the American who pleaded guilty in July to aiding
the Taliban in Afghanistan, has cooperated with authorities and
should be sentenced to 20 years in prison, U.S. prosecutors said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In court documents filed a week before Lindh's Oct. 4 sentencing,
prosecutors said Lindh was following through with his side of an
agreement in which he pleaded guilty to two charges in exchange for
the government dropping all charges related to terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors and defense attorneys said Lindh had submitted to
dozens of hours of lengthy interviews by various law enforcement and
intelligence authorities.</LD>
<TE>   "The government views these proceedings to date as productive and
views the defendant as cooperative," prosecutors wrote. But they
noted that the "principal debriefings" are not complete and said the
Californian would also be subject to a polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors noted that Lindh knew he was breaking laws when he got
involved with the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "John Walker Lindh made choices that broke the laws of the United
States, and engaged in conduct which--by his own
admission--'involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of
terrorism' " they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "For these serious crimes, Lindh now faces imprisonment for 20
years. That is, without question, a severe sentence, but one that is
entirely justified and appropriate under the circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate filing, defense attorneys said Lindh's family was
concerned about where he would be held, and they requested that he be
sent to a prison near his family's home in California where he could
have educational opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   They said publicity surrounding the trial had left misperceptions
about their client.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important, therefore that the court articulate to those
responsible for Mr. Lindh's designation that, despite much public
speculation to the contrary, Mr. Lindh is not a convicted terrorist,
nor does he pose a threat of terrorist violence that would
undoubtedly subject him to the most restrictive and severe conditions
reserved for the most violent of offenders," Lindh's lawyers wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprise plea deal July 15, Lindh, 21, pleaded guilty to one
charge of supplying services to the Taliban by fighting in support of
the fundamentalist movement and to another of carrying explosives
while committing a felony.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Lindh said he provided his services as a soldier
to the Taliban from August to December last year. "I did so knowingly
and willingly, knowing that it was illegal," he said in court.</TE>

<HD>White House Issues Regulation That Defines Fetuses as
Children</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Friday issued a final regulation defining
human fetuses and embryos as children, saying it would allow states
to offer prenatal health care to greater numbers of poor women.</LD>
<LD>   But abortion rights advocates, noting that states already can
cover pregnant women under Medicaid and, with federal permission, the
State Children's Health Insurance Program, called the regulation a
thinly disguised attempt by the administration to weaken abortion
rights.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials rejected such criticism, saying the
regulation was simply intended to make the benefits of prenatal care
available to more unborn children.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a common-sense, compassionate measure to make sure that
all children born in this country come into the world as healthy as
possible," Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another way to secure a safety net of care for our children
and their mothers."</TE>
<TE>   Officials also emphasized Friday that the regulation extends
coverage eligibility to the unborn children of pregnant immigrants,
regardless of whether they are in the country legally.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the provision a "logical extension" of the federal law
that confers citizenship on all children born in the United States,
HHS spokesman Bill Pierce said the new classification extends those
rights "for nine more months."</TE>
<TE>   In California, undocumented immigrants--as well as low-income
pregnant women--already are eligible for prenatal care through the
Medi-Cal program, the state's version of Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   Neither states nor the federal government has any legal basis for
classifying a fetus on the basis of the mother's immigration status,
said Josh Bernstein, senior policy analyst for the National
Immigration Law Center.</TE>
<TE>   "A fetus is not a citizen," he said. "A fetus has no immigration
status."</TE>
<TE>   The regulation, which will take effect 30 days after its
publication Wednesday in the Federal Register, comes more than a year
after officials first floated the idea and eight months after it
officially proposed the change.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, said the new rule "means that many unborn children,
and their mothers as well, are now eligible to receive proper
prenatal care" as part of SCHIP, the State Children's Health
Insurance Program.</TE>
<TE>   Abortion rights advocates reiterated their concerns that a federal
court might someday rule that the legal rights of a fetus trump those
of a pregnant woman.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for Women &amp;
Families, called the regulation "a sham policy [that] at its heart is
both anti-choice and anti-immigrant."</TE>
<TE>   The regulation "fails to provide comprehensive coverage for
pregnant women, instead only providing coverage for the fetus," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Pregnant women may not be covered for ailments unrelated to the
fetuses' needs, and they would be left without critical coverage
after the child is born."</TE>
<TE>   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said her organization had
supported increased access to prenatal care for "a long, long, long
time." But that is not the primary goal of the administration's new
policy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent is quite clear," she said. The administration is using
the new classification as a "vehicle to give the fetus legal status
separate and apart from the woman," with the goal of overturning Roe
vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed a woman's
right to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The release of the new regulation also comes less than six weeks
before November's congressional midterm elections, a fact noted by
activists on both sides of the issue. Indeed, Friday's action was the
latest of several abortion-related votes and statements made by
Republicans in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), an author of the original
SCHIP legislation, noted that Medicaid and SCHIP already can cover
health care for pregnant women and accused the administration of
"grandstanding with abortion politics."</TE>
<TE>   The regulation will allow states to win federal approval "to cover
unborn children" under SCHIP in a few weeks or months, the HHS'
Pierce said. The current waiver procedure can take three to six
months.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson, of the Right to Life Committee, worried that some
state officials would not offer the expanded coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "Will pro-abortion politicians in some states cave in to pressure
from pro-abortion groups who insist there is no such thing as an
unborn child," he asked, "and so deny this aid to mothers and their
babies?"</TE>

<LD>Africa may harbor three species of elephant instead of just two,
suggests a study based on DNA extracted from dung. If that is
confirmed, it means that roughly 12,000 elephants living in western
Africa are a distinct and endangered species, because of their small
scattered populations, researcher Lori Eggert of the Smithsonian
Institution said.</LD>
<LD>   It will take more analysis to determine whether the western
elephants really represent a third species, she added. "We need to
err on the side of caution," she said, because of the implications
for conservation. Her report was published online Sept. 12 by
Proceedings B, a journal of the London-based Royal Society.</LD>
<LD>   To get DNA for the new study, Eggert sampled dung from western
elephants in Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Mali, as well as from
elephants in Cameroon.</LD>

<LD>The tooth fairy may soon have a new line of business. U.S. doctors
said they have managed to grow living pig teeth in rats, a feat of
biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental revolution.
Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful
experiment suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could
one day allow a person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one
grown from his or her own cells.</LD>
<LD>   "The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells
to use in biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to
revolutionize dentistry," said Dominick DePaola, who is president and
chief executive of the institute, which focuses on oral and facial
science.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers said they hope that within five years they will
have developed techniques to grow teeth of a specific size and shape,
and that within 10 years it will be possible to regenerate human
teeth.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent southern floods and northern droughts in China may be due
at least in part to soot in the atmosphere from the incomplete
combustion of coal, biofuels and other materials, according to a new
study in the Sept. 27 issue of Science.</LD>
<LD>   The soot--essentially carbon particles--absorbs sunlight, heating
the atmosphere and thereby altering weather, according to
climatologists Subari Menon of NASA and Columbia University and James
Hansen of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.</LD>
<LD>   China is heavily polluted because of the widespread use of wood,
animal dung and a variety of other materials for cooking and heating.
Inefficient combustion of these fuels produces large amounts of soot
and other pollutants.</LD>

<HD>Evidence of West Nile Virus Found in Breast Milk</HD>
<DH>Health: An infant in Michigan has not shown symptoms of the
disease, but authorities worry they have found another route of
transmission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health authorities said Friday that they found evidence of West Nile
virus in breast milk from a nursing mother, prompting concerns of a
new transmission pathway for the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Michigan woman's child has not become sick,
authorities fear that the infection could be transmitted in breast
milk just like HIV and some other viruses.</LD>
<LD>   That would make a fourth route of transmission. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention already had concluded that the virus
can be transmitted not only by mosquito bites, but also via organ
transplants and blood transfusions.</LD>
<TE>   CDC officials also said that the deadliest outbreak of West Nile
virus in the United States--an epidemic that has sickened 2,339
Americans and claimed 116 lives this year--appears to have peaked and
the number of new cases should begin to decline in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Cooler weather ends the mosquito season, reducing human exposure
to the virus, according to Dr. Lyle Petersen of the CDC. Tropical
Storm Isidore probably also washed away a significant portion of
mosquito eggs and larvae when it flooded parts of Louisiana and
Mississippi this week, further reducing the threat in those states.</TE>
<TE>   The woman in whose breast milk the virus was found is thought to
have been infected via a transfusion.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old woman gave birth Sept. 2 and received transfusions
that day and the next. Although she developed a fever, she was sent
home Sept. 4. She developed flu-like symptoms, however, and was
rehospitalized for three days two weeks later, suffering what is now
a confirmed case of West Nile virus, said Dr. Matthew Boulton, a
Michigan state epidemiologist.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have not proved that she was infected by a
transfusion, but tests of other blood from the same donor show that
it was contaminated by the virus, Boulton said. He added that
Michigan officials have also studied a case involving a 47-year-old
man who developed West Nile disease after a blood transfusion. In
that case also, the virus was found in the donor blood, strengthening
the conclusion that transfusions are a potential source of the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   The Michigan woman breast-fed her baby for two weeks, but stopped
on the advice of her physician when she was hospitalized. Subsequent
tests showed the presence of genetic material from the virus in the
milk. The baby has not developed any symptoms, however, and is
healthy. Michigan officials are now checking the baby's blood,
however, to determine whether the virus was transmitted to the child.</TE>
<TE>   But Petersen cautioned that the CDC has received no confirmed
reports of West Nile virus transmission via breast milk. In fact,
only four babies under the age of 1 year are known to have been
infected. "This would suggest that the risk of West Nile virus
infections from breast milk is going to be low, if there is any risk
at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen urged that women not forgo breast feeding unless they
have a confirmed case of West Nile virus, and even then they should
consult with their physician before doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "If [a woman] has severe disease and cannot breast-feed easily and
provide sufficient nutrition to her child, we certainly in that case
recommend supplemental feeding," he said. "On the other hand, breast
feeding has many beneficial effects ... and the decision to
discontinue breast feeding is a big one."</TE>
<TE>   CDC currently recommends a halt to breast feeding only if the
mother is infected by HIV or human T-cell leukemia virus type 1.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there have been confirmed reports of West Nile
infections in 32 states, including one in California, and the

<HD>Prime Suspect Kevin Williams Dies in Chula Vista</HD>

<LD>Kevin Williams, the man considered the primary suspect in the
disappearances of his brother, former NBA player Brian Williams, and
two others in the South Pacific, died late Friday night at Scripps
Hospital in Chula Vista.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin, 35, also known as Miles Dabord, had been comatose since
being transported to the hospital from Tijuana on Sept. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors informed Kevin's mother, Patricia Phillips, that he had
suffered massive brain damage after he overdosed on insulin and
failed to take his asthma medication.</LD>
<TE>   Phillips removed Kevin from a respirator Thursday morning after
what she called a "home-going" ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Williams, also known as Bison Dele, his girlfriend, Serena
Karlan, and boat captain Bertrand Saldo are assumed dead in the ocean
off Tahiti. Kevin was the last known person to be with them.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said she experienced a peaceful feeling and connected
with Brian during the hospital ceremony for Kevin.</TE>
<TE>   "I actualized [Dele's] death," Phillips said. "That was something
that, for whatever reasons, I had been putting off. I had been seeing
Miles die. But then, suddenly, I felt Brian's spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "He was giving me that look he used to give, where he'd tilt his
head to the side and give me an impish, little boy look. He was
saying, 'You just have to accept this, Mom. It's all right.' And with
that, I finally accepted Brian is dead."</TE>

<HD>Policing a Valley City: the Reality</HD>
<DH>Are residents ready to give up LAPD resources?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY SCHAUER</AU>
<BD>Terry Schauer is a retired Los Angeles police officer
who lives in Sherman Oaks.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am surprised and dismayed when I hear comments from people who
profess that one of the strong arguments for San Fernando Valley
secession would be increased police presence. They should put down
their lattes and look at the real priorities followed by every urban
department in allotting police resources.</LD>
<LD>   All too often, secession supporters "south of the boulevard"--that
would be the hill dwellers and others south of Ventura
Boulevard--speak of a utopian city, comparing the "new" Valley city
to small, wealthy enclaves such as Calabasas. They envision a police
car on every block, no crime and the "down-home" atmosphere of
Mayberry, where perhaps the local cop on the beat could drive you to
church or pick up your groceries at Gelson's.</LD>
<LD>   They forget or dismiss the rest of the new city, north of Ventura
Boulevard, and seem unwilling to accept that diminished police
resources in the new city would have to be parceled out to protect
all the residents in a city that would rival Phoenix in size.</LD>
<TE>   I live in the Valley, and when I talk with the
south-of-the-boulevard people, some seem unaware of how policing
works. Typically, they say that "it'll be so nice to have the police
close by, so they'll be there when we need them." One said, "We never
see police on my street." Well, she lives on a dead-end canyon street
that probably hasn't seen a serious crime, or any crime, in years.</TE>
<TE>   I spent most of my Los Angeles Police Department career as a
senior lead officer in the West Los Angeles Division, which includes
inarguably the wealthiest communities in Los Angeles. Although
affluent residents of the division pay dearly in property taxes, they
get back next to nothing in the numbers of officers assigned to their
neighborhoods. Why? Police resources are sent where they are needed
most--areas with higher crime, more calls for service and denser
population.</TE>
<TE>   As much as the residents of Brentwood, Bel-Air and the Palisades
are "entitled," the LAPD cannot give them their "fair share" of
police resources while ignoring those in less affluent communities
who suffer with serious crime on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the wealthy residents resented the imbalance, but those
with a brain surely realized that heavier enforcement in high-crime
areas also helped to keep the rich folks safe.</TE>
<TE>   And so it would be in the new Valley city. The new mayor would
look at the map and the numbers and put his now more-limited police
resources where they were required, which would not be Sherman Oaks,
Encino or Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Valley residents currently have access to all the resources of one
of the largest and best-equipped municipal police agencies in the
world. Many times, during disasters and unusual occurrences in the
Valley, I was part of the sea of blue that poured "over the hill" to
help, within minutes of being called up.</TE>
<TE>   One of the officers who received an LAPD medal of valor for his
actions at the North Hollywood bank robbery in 1997 had raced over
from my Westside division. He was one of the first officers to
confront the suspect who was running and shooting, coming up to him
on foot and engaging the robber in gunfire. Both the 1971 and 1994
earthquakes saw the Valley flooded with police from other,
less-damaged parts of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Are my neighbors ready to give that up?</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese Sets a Poor Example With Cutbacks</HD>
<DH>The church is abandoning those on the margins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY S. SIKER</AU>
<BD>Jeffrey S. Siker is a professor in the Department of
Theological Studies at Loyola Marymount University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is dismaying that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles has decided to
cut back on essential parts of its official ministry in response to
budget demands.</LD>
<LD>   The offices that are being shut down minister directly to some of
the most disenfranchised populations not only of Los Angeles, but of
the church itself: the Office of Ministry With Persons With
Disabilities, Detention Ministry, Ethnic Groups Ministry, Ministry
With Lesbian and Gay Catholics and the Archdiocesan Council of
Catholic Women, among others.</LD>
<LD>   Can the church truly be the church without officially attending to
such ministries? The words of Jesus ring in a particularly haunting
manner in light of such action: "I was hungry and you gave me no
food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and
you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in
prison and you did not visit me" (Matthew 25:41-43).</LD>
<TE>   It's one thing to cut back on programs, it's another thing to
completely eliminate them. The action of eliminating official
ministries such as those to the disabled, to those in jail and to
lesbian and gay Catholics sends a clear message that such ministries
are both peripheral and expendable.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony hopes that local congregations will take
up these ministries. But if the cardinal hopes to lead and shepherd
by example, how are local congregations to take seriously that
ministries to the disabled or to those in jail are really important?</TE>
<TE>   Such action falls short of embodying the gospel in concrete ways.
Especially in light of the cardinal's staunch support in the past of
those most vulnerable in the world, the present decision is
difficult, at best, to understand. The elimination of these
ministries among others (Campus Ministry and Ecumenical and
Inter-Religious Affairs also were cut) puts the question of
priorities in sharp relief.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, if official church leadership is going to meekly bow out
of important ministries when the fiscal going gets tough, it raises
still deeper questions about the character of the church and its
relationship to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Aren't such ministries precisely at the heart of what it means for
the church to be the church? Official ecclesial sponsorship of such
ministries helps legitimize and authorize the significance of these
ministries. Withdrawal of support de-legitimizes them and makes even
more marginal those who already feel marginalized by church and
society. To put it sharply, when the church hangs up its official
ministry to those who are among the most disaffected and
disenfranchised, then who cares about a new cathedral?</TE>
<TE>   In a time when the church has suffered great shame through the
crisis of sexual abuse cases, is it not still a greater shame to pull
the plug on such crucial ministries? If the church can appeal for
millions to build a new cathedral, can't it appeal for even a portion
of that amount to continue these ministries?</TE>
<TE>   The problems of fiscal management in the church are certainly
complex, but they are also wondrously simple, as is the gospel
message itself: "As you did it to one of the least of these my
brethren, you did it to me" (Matthew 25:40).</TE>

<HD>The Need to Chatter</HD>
<DH>Al Qaeda cell members in Italy were vicious and desperate
to belong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any parent who's ever chauffeured a carload of teens has
eavesdropped, eyes riveted on the road ahead, ears tuned to the young
people chattering innocently among themselves about adolescent
priorities--clothing, friends, music, movie scenes, schoolyard
observations, clothing, something they heard or saw or something they
heard someone saw. Their open talk, even in the obvious presence of
an alien adult, prompts a smile and a recollection of other times and
places when a previous generation chattered away about important
things that no longer matter.</LD>
<LD>   So it was particularly chilling, as a worthy reminder of a more
stark and lethal world out there, to read Sebastian Rotella's recent
account in The Times of chatter recorded by Italian authorities of Al
Qaeda terrorist cell members in Milan, Italy.</LD>
<LD>   Those religious extremists knew authorities, like adult
chauffeurs, were eavesdropping and bugging phones, apartments, even a
mosque. So they drove around in a favorite car, which also was
bugged.</LD>
<TE>   The need to chatter, even when strangers are listening, must be an
international human compulsion; witness the growing number of public
cell phone chats we must overhear.</TE>
<TE>   Chatter can sound meaningless and still inadvertently reveal
passing priorities or predicaments. Or it can provide terrorist plot
details sought by police. But chatter is also important as social
process, even for terrorist wannabes.</TE>
<TE>   With each word spoken and heard, transcripts revealed, the talkers
reassured themselves and each other of their belonging to that group
at that time, of being listened to, laughed with, chided and most of
all included.</TE>
<TE>   The desperation of those exiles adrift in a foreign culture to be
accepted, to belong to a familiar group and to be propped up and
reassured by peers is palpable even if their chatter is far more
lethal than any teen fashion talk.</TE>
<TE>   Both vicious and lonely, the terrorists exchanged war stories,
professed a desire for martyrdom, whined about their host country. "I
hate the people. I hate the documents," says one. "I want to go
anywhere else." On one tape they discuss with relish videos of
colleagues executing captured Russian soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Such chatter, an Italian prosecutor says, helps the group remain
cohesive and relentlessly fanaticized in a secular Western culture
full of many temptations.</TE>
<TE>   For readers far away, this overheard chatter also provides a
revealing window into some far less innocent minds and counters the
temptation to forget that idle chatter these days isn't always idle.</TE>

<HD>He Mined History for Gold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Texan has beaten California to the defining moment in the state's
history.</LD>
<LD>   Every California schoolchild learns about James Marshall's
discovery of gold while building a sawmill alongside the American
River at Coloma on Jan. 24, 1848, exclaiming, "I have found it," or
so he said later.</LD>
<LD>   A new book by Texas A&amp;M professor H.W. Brands takes the schoolkid
facts and richens them into insights like this: The bitter debate
over the admission of California as a state free of slavery in 1850
pushed the nation toward inevitable Civil War. Then, California gold
helped finance the war and restore the union with construction of the
transcontinental railroad, bringing a fractured country into true
nationhood. All in about two decades. Whew.</LD>
<TE>   Brands' "The Age of Gold: The California Gold Rush and the New
American Dream" is being hailed as a dazzling narrative that enlarges
California's role in the nation's history, while making us understand
how quickly it happened. Even California reviewers have gritted their
teeth and handed Brands, an acclaimed popular biographer of Benjamin
Franklin, some Texas-size praise.</TE>
<TE>   "The Age of Gold" gives us the expected story of the discovery,
the mining camps and the subsequent development of Sacramento and San
Francisco as supply depots for the mining region.</TE>
<TE>   Brands richens the tale with the rigors and adventures of hundreds
of thousands of wealth-seekers as they rush to California by sailing
ship--either around the tip of South America or with a land crossing
in Panama--and by overland wagon train. He calls this "the most
astonishing mass movement of peoples since the Crusades" and a
"gathering of the peoples of the world" in California.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Brands takes what popular history sees as an isolated
event into a much larger historical theater. As he puts it: "James
Marshall's discovery of gold at Coloma turned out to be a seminal
event in history, one of those rare moments that divide human
existence into before and after."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond causing and then financing the Civil War, Brands contends,
the Gold Rush laid the foundation for a new American Dream that
anyone could find "respite from toil, security in old age, a better
life for one's children." This revolution of individual success swept
the world and echoes to the third millennium, Brands writes.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, few got rich--or at least stayed rich--finding gold.
Many gave up and went home broke and discouraged. But others found a
different gold in California and stayed to sell clothing and shovels,
to raise crops and livestock, to log forests and establish banks. Now
we find gold in manufacturing, tourism, entertainment and silicon
chips.</TE>
<TE>   As the state motto exclaims: "Eureka!" (That's Greek for "I have
found it"--what Archimedes supposedly said on discovering how to
grade the purity of gold.) The people of the world still gather here,
and they still find it.</TE>

<KH>HELPING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS</KH>
<HD>Governor, Sign Laura's Law</HD>
<DH>Interest groups are bringing pressure to bear against an
important mental health bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By press time Friday night, Gov. Gray Davis still had not signed
"Laura's law," an important bill that would let judges order
outpatient treatment for seriously mentally ill people who can't
fathom the gravity of their condition.</LD>
<LD>   The deadline is midnight Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Davis had pledged to do everything in his power to protect
Californians from crime, so supporters of the bill had expected him
to embrace the measure. It would enable some of California's most
vulnerable people, including many who live on sidewalks or alongside
freeways, to get help before they harm themselves or others. But
opponents of the legislation have grown particularly vocal in recent
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, for instance, a subgroup of the Church of
Scientology, which opposes virtually all psychiatric treatments,
sponsored a rally at the Capitol against Laura's law--named after a
19-year-old killed by a man whose mental illness had been left
untreated.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also might be concerned about a recent report from the
Judicial Council, a rule-making body for California's courts, which
concluded that the bill could be a financial drain on the state.</TE>
<TE>   But the council's analysis overlooks a broad array of information.
For instance, it does not consider that the bill's implementation
would result in fewer criminal prosecutions of nuisance crimes and
more serious offenses, fewer probation violation hearings and fewer
sentences of persons with severe mental illness to jails and prisons.</TE>
<TE>   As Harold Shabo, a mental health expert and former Superior Court
judge in Los Angeles, recently pointed out in a letter to Davis,
"Obviously, the cost of criminal proceedings, which are often
protracted, are higher than the cost of the brief mental health
proceedings that [Laura's law] would require."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Davis often says his top priorities are protecting law and
order. Few bills now before him would do that job better than AB
1421.</TE>

<HD>Why Send a Note Home on the Bond Proposal?</HD>

<LD>I read with great amusement the L.A. Unified School District's
attempt to sell higher taxes ("District to Correct Tax Assessment
Figure," Sept. 20). First the LAUSD used our tax money to write the
"back to school" letter to 630,000 parents with children in our
public schools. It can't even get that right. Was it an attempt to
deceive? The letter read that the bond issue (on the Nov. 5 ballot)
was only going to cost (increase taxes) $5 per month. Now, because it
should have read $5 per month for every $100,000 of assessed
valuation, the district has to send another letter (costing $10,900)
to correct the first letter.</LD>
<LD>   How many houses in Los Angeles do you think carry only a $100,000
tax assessment? How many workbooks would the money it cost to send
both letters have bought? I was under the impression that all the
voters in the November election will get a booklet explaining the
pros and cons of that $3.3-billion bond issue. Why did the LAUSD
think it necessary to just let the parents of school students in on
its bogus information? Taxpayers, be aware of what this bond is going
to cost every property owner in L.A. Break it up; don't vote to raise
your taxes!</LD>

<LD>Count on any type of legislation that benefits average workers to
bring out the worst in this state's relentlessly selfish and
shortsighted business class ("Davis OKs Paid Family Leave Bill,"
Sept. 24).</LD>
<LD>   It is astounding that benefits paid for exclusively with employee
money and not costing employers a dime out of their own pockets are
the cause of whining and gnashing of teeth not heard since the
enactment of child labor laws.</LD>
<LD>   If an employer can't afford to let an employee take time off to
take care of a sick family member or for the birth of a child, then
maybe the numerous costs to our society that benefit these private
money-making ventures are simply too high for the rest of us to have
to bear. Maybe we should just accept that these companies are not
really economically viable or socially beneficial enterprises if they
are unable to provide even the simplest accommodation for their
employees. Perhaps it would not be a bad thing for them to fail under
this apparently onerous burden and allow other, more worker-friendly
companies to develop in their place.</LD>

<TE>   OK, let me get this straight: My one employee currently earns $800
a week of taxable income. She pays $300 a week for child care for her
three kids. Now she can take six weeks off, spend the summer with her
kids, eliminate the cost of child care and earn $440 a week tax-free.
Or how about if I just want to take a long weekend and I'm out of
sick and vacation time? Call your employer and tell him you're taking
two days off, courtesy of the paid family leave bill. You get 55% of
your salary tax-free and a relaxing weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Just remember, Gov. Gray Davis, employers vote--and this one will
be holding her nose and voting for Republican candidate Bill Simon.</TE>

<HD>Living With Urban Coyotes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Couple in Silver Lake Outraged at Coyotes" (Sept. 22), about the
death of my dog: Six weeks prior to the loss of my dog, I attended a
community meeting regarding coyotes. I told them that since we moved
in, coyotes had been in my yard morning, noon and night. Councilman
Tom LaBonge was present and sent his aide to my house to view the
DWP's problematic fence line, from which the coyotes have dug holes,
allowing them into the neighborhood. I constructed a wall in order to
protect my pets. Please realize that the attack not only happened in
front of me but that four toddlers live within 30 yards.</LD>
<LD>   I ask that the city put up signs indicating coyote danger, as well
as looking into the idea of coyote spaying and neutering. I would
also like the DWP to build a proper fence on Armstrong Avenue. People
say that coyotes were here before we were--fine, but this does not
mean that we ignore the problem. We need to educate the community
about the "new" urban coyotes evolving in the area.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, my dog Zu-Zu was not "replaced" by two other dogs. Any
animal lover who loses a pet can never truly replace it. I was three
feet from my dog when the coyote "brushed" past me and grabbed
her--and I will never forget that precious animal looking back at me.</LD>

<TE>   While I am sympathetic for David Vernasco and Kelly Hunt's loss, I
also feel it is their fault for not providing adequate protection for
their pet, not the coyote's for consuming it. I live in Silver Lake
as well and have four cats. If you can hear coyotes yipping, it is a
good idea to keep your pet indoors, as the coyote does not
distinguish between a rat, skunk, mouse or pet when it comes to its
menu.</TE>
<TE>   I personally feel the coyotes are welcome members of the community
and should not be labeled as pests because pests are what they
consume. Silver Lake has no rodent problem thanks to the coyotes, nor
are we inundated with feral cats or stray dogs. By eliminating the
coyotes from the environment, one can only expect an explosion in the
rodent population.</TE>

<TE>   I live on a property in Tujunga near the foothills. My family has
owned this property since about 1919; we have always had many animals
over the years and never worried about leaving them outdoors. Last
year our two beloved cats, which had been with us quite some time,
were brutally killed by coyotes within about 10 feet of the side door
of the house. We have had quite a bit of new development behind us;
this must have been what made the coyotes come closer, into the more
established areas.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the story about the Chihuahua brought back the memories of
our slain pets lying on the lawn. We now have two new cats and worry
whenever they go outside. I feel that cats need to climb trees and be
free to run and play during the day; that's what cats do. Confining
it to the house would be worse than death to a cat.</TE>

<TE>   I understand the frustration of the couple in Silver Lake who had
their small dog killed by a coyote. Here in Carlsbad in San Diego
County, we get the same response from officials: Tough luck, you're
on your own. My neighborhood is not new or out in the hills; we are
close in by the downtown area. I cannot sit outside with my small dog
on my own patio. Coyotes have been spotted in yards as late as 9:30
in the morning, and in my own yard as early as 5:30 in the afternoon.
Many dogs and cats have been killed, and we are told to spray hoses
at the coyotes!</TE>
<TE>   As a taxpayer and voter, I am angry and worried, particularly
about the small children in the neighborhood who can't even play in
their own yards. Coyotes are not an endangered species but a threat
to humans. Why can't they be trapped, removed or destroyed?</TE>

<TE>   Coyotes are resourceful creatures. Indeed, part of the price for
those seeking panoramic views of open space is facing a greater
abundance of wildlife. This includes opossums, skunks, raccoons,
birds and coyotes. Wildlife thrives where habitat types meet.</TE>
<TE>   Wild areas adjoining homes mean lawns, water and sometimes fruit
trees, bird feeders and pet dishes. These may attract creatures,
which in turn attract coyotes. Small dogs and cats in areas adjoining
wilderness--this includes flood control channels--should remain
outside in secure areas or when supervised. No responsible parent
would leave a baby outside unsupervised. Our pets deserve the same
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to curb coyote populations are expensive and produce only
temporary results. A better solution is to adjust our behavior.
Wildlife will cease to venture into our yards when such forays become
less lucrative. A nearby restoration effort increased the presence of
the above-mentioned wildlife in my Costa Mesa neighborhood a few
years ago. My newest cat remains indoors. The other two are kept
inside at night.</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Attacks Remembered</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As someone who has become intimately involved in bioterror
preparations, I disagree with the tenor of Barbara Hatch Rosenberg's
"Anthrax Attacks Pushed Open an Ominous Door" (Opinion, Sept. 22).
Her assertion that public protection is "largely impossible" is
untrue; it depends on the magnitude, location and type of agent. She
states that "biological weapons are preeminently anti-population
weapons" and that "it would be impossible to provide the entire
country with protective suits, masks, detectors, shelters, training
and vaccinations." Bioweapons have been used against both military
and civilian targets. There is almost universal consensus that
well-done preparations can have an important impact. But protective
suits and masks have little, if any, role in protecting a civilian
population against biological weapons.</LD>
<LD>   She also claims that civil defense is "entirely" concerned with
limiting damage rather than "protection" and connects this with
throwing money away and involving "biologists lacking in relevant
experience." Entering into a new area like this takes not only
biologists, but also engineers, public health officials and
clinicians, among others, all working together in a new area. This is
precisely how new scientific advances are made.</LD>
<TE>   She talks about natural outbreaks of disease being a "far more
likely hazard for most people." This might be true, although nobody
knows that. She ignores the fact that virtually all granting
initiatives have consistently emphasized that there should be a dual
preparedness role for both man-made and natural biological events.</TE>
<TE>   She criticizes Ft. Detrick, which I have visited, and the Army for
sloppy and, possibly, clandestine work. There is no evidence that we
have engaged in any offensive biological weapons work since 1969, but
there is abundant evidence that both Russia and Iraq, among others,
have. Finally, she criticizes the U.S. for not supporting enforcement
of the Biological Weapons Convention. While I am in favor of
verifiable bioweapons monitoring, there were so many loopholes in the
proposals that it would have been absurd for us to support them.
Iraq, a country that was found to have abundant biological weapons
and has ignored 16 U.N. resolutions, is a signatory to the
convention.</TE>

<TE>   Rosenberg wrote an interesting review of the anthrax controversy,
but her conclusions don't connect. I propose that the likely "sender"
was a very strong pro-life religious advocate who used 9/11 as a
cover.</TE>
<TE>   Look at who got the "message." The recipients were the tabloid
Sun, the New York Post and NBC anchor Tom Brokaw; Democrat Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle and New York Gov. George Pataki's
Manhattan office; Claire Fletcher, an assistant to CBS News anchor
Dan Rather; Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and then the Supreme Court.
All the targets could be seen as pro-choice.</TE>
<TE>   The only Republican was Pataki, who is pro-choice. Leahy controls
the Senate Judiciary Committee. He controls the proceedings and makes
"choice" an issue in judicial confirmations. The Supreme Court is the
home of abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Look at who did not get the "message." No pro-life organization,
no pro-life politician or conservative newspaper that tended to be
pro-life were targets. That included the White House and the
Republican leadership in the House and Senate.</TE>
<TE>   By simple deduction and the process of elimination, it "smells"
like the sender was a radical pro-life advocate who wanted to send a
message to the pro-choice people. Everyone is barking up the wrong
tree. The sender had nothing to do with Iraq and had no interest in
government spending for biodefense purposes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who thinks that Bill Bratton lets self-promotion get in the
way of the job to be done has never seen him in action ("Bratton
Exhibits Results--and a Taste for Limelight," Sept. 24). Bratton has
headed three good-sized police departments, as head of the New York
transit police and then as police commissioner in Boston and New
York. Only in the last job did Bratton's high profile, generated more
by the spectacular job he did than by any headline-hunting on his
part, get him in trouble: not with the people who worked for him or
with the public but with a mayor who couldn't stand to have anyone
else share the credit.</LD>
<LD>   I've known Bratton for 25 years. We met when he was a police
lieutenant in Boston, already recognized as a rising star, and I was
a young policy analyst in City Hall. I've never known him to make a
claim he couldn't back up with facts. Nor have I ever seen him feed
his own ego at the expense of others. Is he proud of his record?
Sure. With a record like that, why not?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Lopez Builds Bridges Between Police and Communities," Sept.
23: I noticed the negative comments by William Rathburn, a retired
LAPD deputy chief, about Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez. I was
disappointed. Not only were the comments unfair, they were totally
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   I have worked around Lopez for several years and found him to be
exceptionally bright, hard-working and honest. He is well-liked by
his subordinates and his peers. Although he is well qualified to be
chief in L.A., politics may preclude his appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Binkley</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James Hahn has a chance to bring greatness to the LAPD.
Bratton is by far the best chief in America. The man worked miracles
by turning around the New York and Boston police departments. He
knows how to fight crime. He cut the homicide rate by 50% in New York
and serious crime overall by 33%. Bratton brought all the diverse
communities together and they all became partners in fighting crime.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton faced similar problems in Boston and New York with poor
officer morale. He won over the hearts and souls of the police
officers. They loved the guy, and their work product improved. I know
he will do even better in L.A. If Hahn wants a real reduction in
crime and a change in the way things are done at the LAPD, then there
is no better person to lead the LAPD.</TE>

<TE>   In "Jewish Gay Cop Makes an Impression but Fails to Make Cut"
(Sept. 22), Steve Lopez would have us believe that he is speaking out
against hate groups' unfounded prejudices in the case of David
Kalish. But Lopez gets into the same dirty bathwater when he compares
Kalish's isolation among macho cops to that of feeling "as out of
place as a straight man in a seminary." Lopez's blanket judgment of
all seminarians (and indirectly, those in the priesthood) as, well,
of course, gay, is unjust and unfounded. I mean, we all know that all
priests are gay, don't we? Is that your slant, Mr. Lopez? Your simile
was irresponsible and inaccurate.</TE>

<LD>Our family owns a partial interest in a parcel in the Hollister
Ranch, the "community of large estates" along the Gaviota Coast that
you reference in your Sept. 23 editorial as an example of public
access denied. We are not rich; we have owned this property for over
15 years and have not been able to afford to even build a habitable
structure on it. Not mentioned is the fact that Hollister Ranch does
have public access, through its scientific access programs, open to
those who apply and follow the rules to preserve what the Hollister
Ranch is, a coastline and tide pool preserve that has been used by
the scientific community for years to study pristine areas. This
access program was set up and is funded by the Hollister Ranch owners
and was not forced upon them but done as a community service project.</LD>
<TE>   Also not mentioned is the fact that the 14,000 acres of land that
comprises the Hollister Ranch has significant development controls
already in place and is therefore already "protected" from continued
coastal development. It allows only one main house per 100 acres and
is a working cattle ranch. So, the protection you reference that
would take place if the Gaviota Coast were designated as the magical
"national seashore" is already in place. The only remaining issue
would seem to be open public access, and even our state and national
parks limit access and usage to protect and preserve their assets.
The owners of the Hollister Ranch only desire to do the same.</TE>

<HD>Driver's Licenses Flawed as National ID Cards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his Sept. 23 commentary, "Treat Driver's Licenses as What They
Are: Domestic Passports," Amitai Etzioni freely admits that in his
ideal world our driver's licenses would serve as a national
identification card. His candor is admirable. His logic is not.
Etzioni passes over the obvious: Do Americans really trust their
departments of motor vehicles to run a complex national ID
program--keeping our most sensitive information secure from
information pirates and free from bureaucratic error? And will his
driver's-license-as-national-ID actually make us any safer? Won't the
whole system be built on a house of phony cards?</LD>
<LD>   Consider the ease with which the Sept. 11 hijackers and other
identity thieves were--and are--able to obtain phony IDs and the
"breeder documents" (birth certificates, earlier state driver's
licenses, Social Security cards) that would be the basis for
"proving" identity before the card is issued. Meanwhile, a national
ID would lead to widespread discrimination against persons of color,
who will be constantly asked, "Your papers, please." And it would
require the creation of a complex web of privacy-robbing databases.
When the stark dangers of national IDs are balanced against their
illusory security benefits, it is hard to see their point.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's a much easier and less costly way for the federal
government to upgrade all the state-run driver's license systems into
a coherent national identity system: We can build on the existing
Social Security database.</TE>
<TE>   The advantage of using Social Security numbers is that there is
already a well-established national standard in place, and their use
is widespread among almost all American citizens from an early
age--and most legal aliens. By contrast, driver's licenses are issued
later in life and, in some instances, not issued at all.</TE>
<TE>   Given the extensive use of Social Security numbers as unique
identifiers for important activities like retirement distributions,
tax filing, credit applications and student financial aid, the system
already possesses the standards and integrity required to form the
backbone for a new national ID.</TE>

<HD>Sorority Deaths: Stop Dangerous Hazing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So the Los Angeles police believe that a bunch of young women were
innocently jogging on the beach during late evening and early morning
hours and the drowning deaths of Kristin High and Kenitha Saafir had
nothing to do with sorority hazing ("Suit Alleges Hazing in Death,"
Sept. 24). Was the investigation done by a squad of sitcom
detectives? An 8-year-old child wouldn't believe that story.</LD>
<LD>   To make it worse, apparently the sorority has taken no
responsibility nor has it even contacted the surviving family members
to express condolences. There's an organization with the improvement
of society at the top of its agenda!</LD>
<LD>   Against this background I'm happy to see the survivors sue the
sorority--hopefully into bankruptcy. Maybe this is the type of
message that will stop fraternities and sororities from engaging in
their stupid and dangerous hazing rituals. We certainly don't need
these senseless injuries and deaths.</LD>

<HD>Germany, U.S. Differ Over Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way the U.S. media in general are reacting to Germany's stance on
Iraq these days, they want you to believe that Germany has declared
war on us ("Schroeder Softens Tone on U.S.," Sept. 24). I suggest
instead that perhaps it is President Bush who is making too much of
it. Obviously his feelings got hurt, but I would like to think that
the leader of the free world is above a few ruffled feathers. A great
leader would not be making such a fuss over a personal issue. Get
over it, Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Arlene Williams</LD>
<LD>   Sparks, Nev.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did not win because of his
"steadfast refusal to commit German troops to a war against Iraq"
(Sept. 23). This is inflammatory and ignores the realities of local
politics, which drive all democracies. Schroeder won because of his
rapid and empathetic handling of the flood crisis in eastern Germany
and ultimate misgivings by most Germans about electing a southern
German to the leadership of the entire country.</TE>
<TE>   I am ashamed, as an American, at the huge huff this administration
(and its press) takes on when our allies do not go in lock-step with
our views. It is immature, if not arrogant, and creates the very
hatred that has become our enemy. Bush and his administration are
vaunted for all their business expertise, which many people of their
party would want applied to government.</TE>
<TE>   I ask any truly successful business person reading this letter: If
you applied these same bullying tactics--the arrogance toward friend
and foe alike and the failure to account for everyone else's
agenda--to your own business, how successful would you be?</TE>
<TE>   Maude Ham</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who abrogated some treaties during the late '30s? Who ignored the
existing world organization during that same time? Who asked for and
received massive powers to conduct a war? Who ignored international
public opinion? Aren't these the very things that Bush is doing
today? Why are the media being so harsh on German Justice Minister
Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, who pointed this out the other day? All she
was doing was pointing out the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Let us call a spade a spade and let the chips fall where they may.
There are obviously many stark differences between Bush and Hitler,
but there are some parallels too. Hopefully our Senate will show more
courage than the German Bundestag.</TE>

<HD>Bond Sales Should Repay State in Weeks</HD>
<DH>Finances: Angelides plans to take in nearly $12 billion to
cover power crisis spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The billions of dollars drained from California coffers by the
electricity crisis should be replaced by early November under a
schedule state Treasurer Phil Angelides announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Angelides hopes to sell $11.95 billion in bonds over the next six
weeks. The cash raised will be used to repay the state's general
fund, with interest, for the purchase of electricity in 2001 when
three private utilities were too short of cash to do it themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The first of the bonds are expected to be sold the week of Oct.
27.</LD>
<TE>   The bond sale comes more than a year after Angelides' original
target date. But the delay may prove a blessing. Interest rates for
municipal debt are now unusually low, and stock market turmoil makes
such bonds a more stable, attractive investment to some.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the state is coming to market at an ideal time," said
Steven Permut, vice president of municipal research for American
Century Investments in Mountain View, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Each month for the next 20 years, customers of Southern California
Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric will pay
off more of the $11.95-billion debt through their monthly electricity
bills. While the exact bond charge hasn't been finalized, preliminary
estimates put it at between $2.50 and $3.50 per month for the average
residential customer.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say no rate hike is needed to cover the bond costs
in the near term, beyond an increase enacted last year that fell most
heavily on business and industrial customers. But the bond obligation
makes it less likely that the utility rates--now among the highest in
the nation--will fall any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides said he will not release many details about the
structure of the sale until Thursday. But Wall Street's three main
credit-rating agencies on Friday released their opinions of the
offering.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings were mixed and less than ideal: Standard &amp; Poor's
assigned the bonds BBB-plus, two notches above its lowest
investment-grade category. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings gave the bonds the equivalent of an A-minus.</TE>
<TE>   Lower ratings mean higher interest costs for utility customers.
For example, recent average market interest rates on 20-year
municipal bonds rated "A" are quoted at 4.8%, compared with 5% to
5.5% for A-minus to BBB-plus-rated bonds. The difference would amount
to roughly $70 million a year in additional interest payments on a
$12-billion offering.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Angelides said the ratings are what he expected on a bond
deal so big and complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "Given all that we have been through over the past year, yes, we
are pleased," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bond sale was delayed many months as some members of the
Public Utilities Commission and the administration of Gov. Gray Davis
argued over how to do three things at once: guarantee that both power
companies and bond buyers would get paid and still give state
regulators discretion over electricity rates.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, to make the bond sale possible, the PUC gave up much
of its authority to set electricity rates. The panel of five
gubernatorial appointees agreed to raise rates as necessary to match
the costs of the state Department of Water Resources, which has been
buying power for the utilities since blackouts threatened the state
on Jan. 17, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The energy bonds will reimburse the state's taxpayers for $6.1
billion taken from the general fund, plus $500 million in interest.
The bonds will also retire a $4.3-billion loan taken out in June 2001
to help cover electricity costs. The remainder of the money will be
used for reserves, issuance costs and bond insurance fees.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell said Friday that even if
Angelides sells the bonds as expected, she will need to borrow
roughly $10.5 billion immediately to help the state get through a
cash crunch next month.</TE>
<TE>   A faltering economy and over-optimistic revenue estimates by the
Davis administration make additional borrowing necessary, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have our first slug of money by Oct. 18 and his energy
bond is not going to be done by Oct. 18," said Connell.</TE>

<LD>The formerly conjoined twins from Guatemala are both improving, and
one of them, Maria de Jesus Quiej Alvarez, has been moved from
intensive care to a regular room, doctors at UCLA's Mattel Children's
Hospital said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 14-month-old also was upgraded to good condition, and while
her sister, Maria Teresa, remains in intensive care, her condition
has been upgraded to fair.</LD>
<LD>   "Maria de Jesus was able to leave the intensive care unit because
she no longer requires a drain to relieve extra fluid from her
brain," said Dr. Jorge Lazareff, director of the UCLA pediatric
neurosurgery program and lead neurosurgeon on the case.</LD>
<TE>   The girls, conjoined at the head at birth, were separated in a
surgery Aug. 6 that took nearly 23 hours. The doctors anticipate both
will be well enough to return home to Guatemala in October.</TE>

<LD>Two carjackers robbed a man at an automated teller machine Friday and
then pushed his unoccupied car off a cliff, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim was robbed about 12:30 a.m. after he withdrew $40 from
an ATM at a Washington Mutual branch in the 16500 block of Soledad
Canyon Road. Two men in a pickup truck demanded, at gunpoint, both
the money and the man's car, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of a new one," Sheriff's Lt. Steve Dolan said. "I don't
know why they would steal a car just to push it off a cliff."</LD>

<LD>Los Angeles and several other municipalities have lost a bid to force
the federal government to statistically adjust the results of the
2000 census to account for people who were missed.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government did not violate census laws when officials
refused to use statistical, or sampling, methods to recount census
results, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. The decision
upheld a federal district court ruling.</LD>
<LD>   The cities said they are getting fewer federal dollars than they
are entitled to because the government undercounted their residents.
Federal officials argued that statistical sampling would be
unreliable.</LD>

<LD>A Huntington Beach man who police say threatened to kill people at
random if authorities didn't stop searching for him in connection
with the attempted murder of a Garden Grove patrolman was arrested
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jacob T. Marchesano, 25, was taken into custody without incident
by Downey police about 1:30 a.m. in the 12800 block of Eastbrook
Avenue after investigators who had been in contact with him by
telephone were able to persuade him to surrender.</LD>
<LD>   Police say Marchesano was a passenger in a pickup that Garden
Grove Police Officer Pat Gildea pulled over late Monday for a traffic
violation. Authorities said Marchesano shot at Gildea after fleeing
from the pickup. Gildea wasn't injured.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the pickup was arrested on suspicion of attempted
murder of a police officer. Marchesano is being held in Orange County
Jail on suspicion of the same crime.</TE>
<TE>   The search for Marchesano intensified Thursday after he called
investigators and threatened to kill people at random if police
didn't "back off." He also threatened to kill a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Marchesano, who has a juvenile record of violent
crime, called them several times and sounded emotionally unbalanced.
It was in one such call that investigators talked him into giving up.</TE>

<DH>Crime: A woman pulled over in Yorba Linda may have stolen
more than 20, police say. Documents in car link her and her mother to
scams across Southland, they say.</DH>

<LD>A woman who was pulled over in Yorba Linda for driving with illegally
tinted windows and then allegedly produced a fake driver's license is
suspected of stealing the identities of more than 20 people in Los
Angeles and Riverside counties, Brea police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Monica Dawn Ferguson, 27, of Lancaster was stopped Sunday by a
Brea police officer on Old Canal Road because her driver's side
window was illegally tinted, police said. She handed the officer a
driver's license that police said had a false birth date and name. A
background check revealed that she had an outstanding $25,000 warrant
from Riverside County on forgery and narcotics-related charges.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said that when they searched Ferguson's gold Nissan
Maxima, they found fake ID cards, checks, and credit card and real
estate applications. The documents may link Ferguson and her mother,
Cynthia, to a spate of fraud schemes throughout Southern California,
police said. A computer, counterfeiting tools and receipts of items
purchased with counterfeit checks also were found in the car,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Ferguson was arrested on the outstanding warrant and on suspicion
of forgery, fake identification, counterfeit checks and falsely
identifying herself to the officer, police said. She is being held at
Orange County Jail in Santa Ana on $75,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   "They've spent an awful lot of time going from business to
business to commit the crimes," said Lt. Martin Needham of the Brea
Police Department, which patrols Yorba Linda. The mother-daughter duo
would steal people's identities by sifting through mailboxes, trash
or belongings to obtain checks, bills or other personal information,
Needham said.</TE>
<TE>   The paper trail links the women to identity theft-related crimes
in Riverside, Moreno Valley, Corona, Monrovia and Marina del Rey,
Needham said. Most of the businesses targeted, including banks,
credit card companies, telephone companies and retail stores, are in
Riverside County. "We're looking at thousands of dollars that were
stolen," Needham said.</TE>

<HD>No Doughnuts, No Humble Pie at LAPD</HD>
<DH>Image: What? A chief from New York? Police officers in Los
Angeles feel fitter and generally superior to their colleagues in the
NYPD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the lowest patrol officer to the highest brass, mere mention of
the fact that Los Angeles may soon have a New Yorker as chief tends
to provoke one response: We are better.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Police Department's notion of its superiority goes
back decades, as far as the popular television series "Adam 12."</LD>
<LD>   In the minds of many LAPD officers, the series' hero, trim,
fresh-faced LAPD Officer Kent McCord, puts to shame Andy Sipowicz,
the troubled and portly archetype of "NYPD Blues."</LD>
<TE>   "Adam 12," which ran from 1968-75, and the LAPD classic "Dragnet,"
are often mentioned by LAPD officers old enough to remember and still
be inspired by them.</TE>
<TE>   Such shows portrayed the department favorably on purpose, of
course. But there was more to it than choir-boy haircuts and
do-goodism. LAPD officers love "Adam 12" and "Dragnet" because the
cops they portrayed captured the image they like to project of cool
professionalism.</TE>
<TE>   "They separated things from emotion, and they always did the right
thing," LAPD Lt. Mike Albanese said.</TE>
<TE>   The ideal endures in his unit, where officers goad one another to
do chin-ups and charity work, Albanese said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officers will tell you they work differently from New York's,
walk differently. Theirs say "job." Ours say "mission." Theirs say
"perp." Ours say "suspect."</TE>
<TE>   And finally, "LAPD officers always had higher appearance and
physical fitness standards," said Tom Elfmont, a former LAPD captain.
To this day, "you gotta look squared away. You gotta look sharp."</TE>
<TE>   The public here accepts nothing less, he said. "It's a Southern
California thing. We all go to the gym and talk about what we eat.
And our cops have to look great."</TE>
<TE>   The department maintains strict, Disney-esque guidelines on
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   But the lengths that LAPD officers go to in order to look good
frequently go beyond the manual. Despite the fact that it is not
required for most officers, a cult of fitness prevails.</TE>
<TE>   Station houses have gyms, and thousands of officers participate in
organized police sports leagues. Weightlifting is so big, and the
LAPD beefcake phenomenon so pronounced, that some commanders worry
that it's gotten out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   Without question, many LAPD officers do not live up to the image.
Still, the doughnut shop jokes about cops here don't go over so well.</TE>
<TE>   "If officers stop at doughnut shops, it's just to get coffee to
keep them awake," boasts former Chief Daryl Gates.</TE>
<TE>   As proof, the department notes that many LAPD teams have winning
records. The Baker-to-Vegas law enforcement relay race was won this
year by the LAPD Metro runners team, who passed their NYPD
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Football is a different story. The proud Los Angeles P.D.
Centurions lost, 7-6, to the mightier NYPD team the last time the two
met on the field. Contrite Det. Donald Payne, captain of the LAPD's
team, earnestly promises to do better next time.</TE>
<TE>   But then, showing the LAPD's flare for battling negative
publicity, Payne tried to put a better spin on it.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD lacked a kicker this year, he said. "We had the better
team," Payne said. "But due to circumstances beyond our control, we
lost.... Had our kicker been there, it would have been different."</TE>
<TE>   Payne is 39, 5 feet 7, 170 pounds, and can bench-press more than
300 pounds. He too believes that New Yorkers have "a different
mentality, a different way of policing." But with classic LAPD
wariness, he declined to say what he really meant.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to comment, NYPD officers were somewhat blunter,
faster-talking and feistier.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of the kicker, Officer Mike Immitt, a 23-year veteran
of the NYPD and head of its sports committee, snapped: "The only
thing they have that we don't is a tan!"</TE>
<TE>   He offered himself as an example. At 45, he said he runs sub
6-minute miles despite being an unrepentant smoker.</TE>
<TE>   But the star of the NYPD football team is Officer Joe "The Gut"
Giustino, a patrolman in the department's 72nd Precinct in Brooklyn.
Giustino, slot receiver and tight end, also smokes but does not work
out much. He said the nickname is "because of a part of me that is
larger than it should be." He pronounces it "law-jer."</TE>
<TE>   Six-foot-3 and 300-some pounds, Giustino promised future wins,
questioned the LAPD's grace in defeat, and offered this assessment:
"They seem to be a very cocky bunch."</TE>

<HD>Clean-Air Law Extended to Bay Area</HD>
<DH>Bills: The region, whose auto exhaust pollutes Central
Valley, will be subject to Smog Check 2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Friday signed legislation abolishing a
controversial exemption and subjecting San Francisco Bay Area
motorists to the same clean-air rules of Smog Check 2 that apply to
millions of other drivers in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced) said his bill would make the
Central Valley a healthier place because it would combat the flow of
"secondhand smog" that prevailing winds blow from the Pacific Ocean
over the coastal mountain range and into the geographical trough from
Sacramento to Fresno.</LD>
<LD>   Cardoza, who led a six-year campaign to protect the valley from
vehicle-caused air pollution, praised Davis' signature on his bill,
AB 2637, as a victory for "environmental justice." Davis called it a
"historic day." But no Bay Area legislator attended the bill-signing
ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   Asked about their absence, Davis sidestepped a direct answer,
saying he believes they understand the "simple fairness" of extending
the strict auto emission and intensified inspection standards to the
San Francisco Bay region.</TE>
<TE>   For years, regions with the state's dirtiest air, including Los
Angeles, San Diego, Fresno and Sacramento, have been subject to the
strict standards of Smog Check 2 as California struggled to comply
with federal clean-air laws.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, powerful political forces in the Bay Area, one of
California's most densely populated and industrially developed
regions, managed to hold back imposition of Smog Check 2.</TE>
<TE>   They argued the program was not needed because prevailing winds
from the ocean cleansed Bay Area skies and blew its air pollution
elsewhere, mainly to the sprawling Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   But clean-air advocates complained it was unfair and unhealthy for
the valley to serve as a dump site for the San Francisco region's air
pollutants, especially when Bay Area motorists were exempt from the
toughest smog requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Under Smog Check 2, vehicles must be inspected and tested every
two years and upon change of ownership. Vehicles that fail must be
repaired and retested before they can be registered, a process that
can be expensive, even with built-in safeguards to mitigate costs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis estimated that 4.5 million additional vehicles will be
tested starting Jan. 1. That, he said, will result in a daily
reduction of 10 tons of reactive organic gases and 16 tons of oxides
of nitrogen, each a precursor to smog, and a decrease of 640 pounds a
day of benzene, a carcinogen.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also signed bills banning the sale to minors of
dietary supplements containing the stimulant ephedra. The measures
will require more direct warning labels, and require that
manufacturers place a toll-free number on packages so consumers can
report ill effects to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had concluded in 2000 that regulation of such products was a
federal issue, after Metabolife Inc., one of the largest
manufacturers of such products, donated $150,000 to the governor. On
Friday, Davis chided the federal government as he signed the bills,
SB 1884 by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) and SB 1948 by Sen.
Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont).</TE>
<TE>   "While [regulation] of dietary supplements and interstate commerce
is the responsibility of the federal government," Davis said in a
signing message, "Californians can't wait for federal action that is
too long overdue."</TE>
<TE>   The governor also signed legislation that originated from
proposals submitted by Californians in a competition called "There
Oughta be a Law," an annual contest sponsored by Assemblyman Joe
Simitian (D-Palo Alto).</TE>
<TE>   One winner, AB 2474, will require manufacturers of antifreeze to
add a bitter taste agent to their poisonous product so that children
and pets will not drink it. The idea came from nurse Lauren Ward of
Cupertino, who spent $10,000 and two weeks of her time last year
investigating what made the family puppy sick. She finally determined
it was antifreeze, which has a sweet taste.</TE>

<HD>It's a Jungle Out There for Angel Opponents</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: An electronic Rally Monkey at Edison Field
has evolved from a good-luck charm to a phenomenon for the
playoff-bound team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this game of superstitions--a game in which grown men resort to
silly rituals just to keep a streak going--there is one undeniable
rule: Don't mess with a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   So it comes to this, as Disney's Cinderella team heads into the
American League playoffs for the first time in 16 years: Its best
good-luck charm is a monkey.</LD>
<LD>   But who cares? The Anaheim Angels, who didn't exactly storm into
the playoffs, need all the help they can get Tuesday as they start a
best-of-five series against the New York Yankees, a team that has
been to the playoffs every year since 1995.</LD>
<TE>   This is no ordinary good-luck charm. For one thing, it's purely
electronic.</TE>
<TE>   The Rally Monkey debuted two years ago when Angel staff members at
Edison International Field, on a whim, flashed canned video of a
monkey on the JumboTron with the words "Rally Monkey" superimposed.
The crowd cheered; the team rallied from a six-run deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a fluke that surprised even Disney's marketing masters,
the Rally Monkey evolved into an unofficial mascot--and a full-blown
phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Now, cheering fans wave stuffed toy monkeys in the stands. He's a
staple of video clips on ESPN's SportsCenter. Sports columnists are
listing him as one of the intangible factors the Angels have in their
favor. He's got a banana drink named after him at a restaurant near
the stadium, groupies and a Web site (www.rallymonkey.com) where
people leave messages proclaiming, "I believe in the power of the
monkey!"</TE>
<TE>   Angel officials soon realized they were onto something special and
hired a monkey that had appeared in the movie "Outbreak" and on NBC's
"Friends." They dressed him in an Angels uniform and ran him through
some stunts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the silliness of it is half the appeal," said Alex
Brewsaugh, 20, of Orange. "I mean, it's a monkey. It has absolutely
nothing to do with baseball or the Angels, but it just fits.... The
rest of the nation has no clue what we're doing. They're probably
saying, 'What are those people smoking in California?' "</TE>
<TE>   For those keeping track, the Rally Monkey's record up to Thursday
is 56-41 lifetime and 24-18 this season. Not bad considering the
Angels call him out only when the team is losing.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rally Monkey's popularity has a downside. The Angels are
careful not to overexpose it--a lesson learned after they hired a
real capuchin monkey, brought it out to the field and celebrated the
Rally Monkey's birthday with a big, showy tribute. The Angels lost,
prompting pitcher Jarrod Washburn to accuse management of "making a
mockery of the game."</TE>
<TE>   The only other time a live monkey appeared at a game, the Angels
also lost. In a bow to superstition, Angels entertainment manager
Peter Bull concluded, "Maybe his place is on the video screen."</TE>
<TE>   So he lives only on the JumboTron at Edison Field. There also are
some unwritten rules about when he pokes his head out:</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have to be tied or losing after the fifth inning.
Beyond that, the timing is a gut call, perhaps like a manager making
a pitching change. Bull consults a few advisors, then decides.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a mascot," Bull said. "He's like a baseball player with
his specialty. He comes out when he's needed. He doesn't go beyond
his abilities. He's a role player."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard for Bull to say that without chuckling a little bit.
This is, after all, nothing more than a jumping monkey on a screen.
But there's a fine line between acknowledging its silliness and
respecting its power.</TE>
<TE>   And if it gets into the minds of opposing players, well, all the
better. The minute he appears, the fans go bananas. They chant,
"Rally Monkey!" and wave the plush animals high.</TE>
<TE>   "Some players hate it and ignore it," Bull said. "Others, I don't
know if they can handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Mariners officials once joked about blasting Peter
Gabriel's "Shock the Monkey" over the loudspeakers, though they never
did. And after a series in July in Anaheim, Seattle Manager Lou
Piniella said he was happy he didn't have to see it again until
September.</TE>
<TE>   While it may seem like fun and games, those who track sports
marketing gimmicks say the Angels have inadvertently created a cult
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a brand and it's become a point of distinction for
the Angels at their ballpark," said Dan Migala, editor of Team
Marketing Report, which tracks sports marketing and sponsorship
information.</TE>
<TE>   Already, other teams have tried to imitate the stunt. The
Milwaukee Brewers last year launched the Rally Rabbit and the NFL
Indianapolis Colts created the Touchdown Monkey in their 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Neither has become wildly successful, proving that audiences can
be finicky.</TE>
<TE>   If there's one routine knock against Angel fans, it's their
lackluster cheering.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Not since 1979 have I seen the fans, like myself, so up for the
games," said Chris Thompson of Anaheim. "The Rally Monkey is a
wonderful thing."</TE>
<TE>   Is the jumping simian enough to lift the team past the Yankees?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely. Definitely," said fan Brewsaugh.</TE>
<TE>   But he's not taking any chances. "I've got four Rally Monkeys. I
have a nice little shrine in the corner of my room."</TE>

<LD>The Huntington Beach Independent's police log said "a person reported
that there was a headless life-size blow-up doll across the street
wearing a green outfit."</LD>
<LD>   Here's the part I don't understand: Why green? It doesn't go with
anything.</LD>
<LD>   Guide to Adventurous Dining: Today's specimens (see accompanying)
include:</LD>
<TE>   * A sightless watermelon (submitted by Patrick Manfredi of
Rosemead). I like the concept; I hate it when I'm eating a melon and
it's staring back at me.</TE>
<TE>   * An expensive place to hold a barbecue (sent by my most frequent
contributor, "Anonymous").</TE>
<TE>   * Some of the hottest wines on the market (from Sandy and Jeanie
Gaynor of L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   * A food merchant who had the misfortune to share a marquee next
to a less-than-appetizing business (photo by Jerry Lewine of Agoura
Hills).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: In four cases, drivers were summoned to
court and had their licenses suspended. And what did they do then?
They got back in their cars and drove away, the Long Beach
Press-Telegram said. But they didn't get very far before they were
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No best-actor nomination here: "The Thin Blue Line," an LAPD
publication, recounted how a robbery suspect escaped during
questioning by police and fled into the apartment of a friend.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived, the man "tried to pretend that he had just
gotten out of bed. The suspect, in an attempt to evade the officers,
shaved his mustache, but left the razor with hair in it, in the
kitchen." Neatness does count.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The sky must have been falling: On the CHP traffic logs, Vince
Stickel read about this unfolding freeway chase on Interstate 15:</TE>
<TE>   "11:17 a.m.: TK [truck] is loaded w/crates of live chickens.</TE>
<TE>   "11:17 a.m.: One of the crates is open and driver is losing
chickens one by one in the rdwy.</TE>
<TE>   "11:29 a.m.: Now 5 mi [miles out], pulled over trying to catch
chickens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lagunatics Dept.: The Coastline Pilot of Laguna Beach said "a
resident reported that two people were walking around in strange
costumes at 11 a.m. One was dressed in a witch hat and mask; the
other was wearing a devil mask and cape."</TE>
<TE>   The witness must be a new resident. That's hardly strange for
Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLANy: Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully told listeners he knew
it had been a long season when the mascot of one team sponsor cropped
up in his dream the other night. Said the incredulous Scully: "I

<HD>M. Marmarosa, 76; Jazz Pianist With Dorsey, Shaw, Krupa
Bands</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael "Dodo" Marmarosa, 76, a jazz pianist who worked with the
Tommy Dorsey Orchestra and Artie Shaw's Gramercy Five before becoming
a fine bebop player, died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack at a
Veterans Affairs medical center near Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Marmarosa was born in Pittsburgh and studied classical piano as a
child. But he became inspired by the playing of pianists Art Tatum
and Teddy Wilson, and switched to jazz.</LD>
<LD>   After playing with the Gene Krupa band around Pittsburgh,
Marmarosa played with Dorsey and Shaw. The influence of bebop began
to show in his work in the mid-1940s.</LD>
<TE>   He moved to Los Angeles in 1946, and became the house pianist for
a label called Atomic. He later played on sessions with Charlie
Parker, including one in 1947 that resulted in Parker's "Relaxin at
Camarillo." But aside from a few dates on Atomic and some for Savoy,
Marmarosa's recording output is fairly slim.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by health problems, Marmarosa returned to Pittsburgh in
the mid-1950s, all but disappearing from public view until a brief
return in 1961, when he released an album called "Dodo's Back" on
Argo.</TE>

<HD>Priest Charged in Molestations Is Arrested in Alaska</HD>
<DH>Crime: L.A. prosecutors file 23 counts, saying acts in G.
Neville Rucker's case spanned 30 years. He is seized on cruise ship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A priest wanted for allegedly molesting children was snatched by
authorities from a cruise ship that had been diverted on the high
seas to Alaska's Aleutian Islands on Friday at the request of Los
Angeles police.</LD>
<LD>   G. Neville Rucker, a retired 82-year-old Roman Catholic priest,
offered no resistance when Alaska state troopers took him into
custody, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We were not going to let him go to another country," said LAPD
Capt. Sharyn Buck.</LD>
<TE>   Rucker had been on a cruise ship, the Volendam, heading for
eastern Russia. The ship made an unscheduled stop in the remote port
of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials used the pretext of an injured crew member to explain
the change in itinerary, which was arranged with the help of the U.S.
Coast Guard and Alaska state troopers, officials said</TE>
<TE>   "We did not want to alert anyone on the ship," said Coast Guard
Chief Petty Officer Roger W. Wetherell. "But a crew member on the
cruise ship had suffered an injury, so passengers were told that was
the reason for the diversion."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest comes two days after prosecutors asked Rucker's
attorney to surrender his client. Investigators had mistakenly
believed Rucker would give himself up and were surprised to learn he
had left on a cruise. The LAPD never considered Rucker to be a
fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, prosecutors filed 23 charges of child molestation
against Rucker. If convicted on all counts, Rucker could be sentenced
to 26 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Volendam was on a 64-day Pacific circle cruise out of
Vancouver, Canada, with its next scheduled port of call Petropavlosk
in eastern Russia on Oct. 1. It left from Vancouver on Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   "We received a request from U.S. law enforcement to disembark a
passenger, and we cooperated," said Rose Abello, spokeswoman for
Holland America Lines, which owns the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker's attorney, Donald Steier, on Friday accused police of
overreacting to what he says was a vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Rucker molested seven girls while he
worked at several churches in Los Angeles County, including St.
Alphonsus in East Los Angeles, St. Anthony in El Segundo and St.
Agatha in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   All of the girls were under 14 when they were abused, prosecutors
said. Rucker was charged with crimes spanning 30 years, beginning in
the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   According to the criminal complaint, Rucker abused his first
victim in 1947 and continued molesting girls until 1976. He is
accused of molesting four girls once, one girl three times and
another four times. The majority of the counts--12--relate to one
girl, whom prosecutors say he molested from 1971 to 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, three women who allege that Rucker molested them
in the 1970s at St. Agatha said they felt victimized again upon
hearing that he had left the country on a cruise, and relieved when
he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe they managed to stop the ship," said Wendy
Kennedy, who is among those Rucker is charged with molesting.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's sister, Jackie Dennis, 41, who claims Rucker molested
her when she was a grade school student in the 1970s at St. Agatha's
school, said: "I want justice for each of his victims. Church leaders
allowed this man to continue to serve after he was caught molesting
girls in El Segundo."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials have known for three decades about 1967
child abuse accusations against Rucker. He was accused of molesting
two 9-year-old girls at St. Anthony parish in El Segundo during the
1960s, according to a police report and court records. Rucker at the
time denied any misconduct at the church, where he served as
associate pastor from 1962 to 1967.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony's predecessor,
then-Bishop Timothy Manning, persuaded the mother of one of the El
Segundo girls not to press criminal charges.</TE>

<HD>Car Plant Builder Agrees to Do Full Review</HD>
<DH>Environment: The developers bow to criticism after Oxnard
planners reverse their position on study of site near Ormond Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bowing to activists' demands and a recommendation from city planners,
the developer of a proposed $25-million car processing plant in south
Oxnard has agreed to conduct a full environmental review of the
project.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Vehicle Processors wants to convert a 38-acre vacant
parcel south of Hueneme Road into a plant for preparing imported
vehicles before they are shipped to dealerships throughout the
region.</LD>
<LD>   The Planning Commission recently decided that the project did not
require an extensive environmental review. But city planners reversed
themselves this week, recommending a full study.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, a consultant for Pacific Vehicle Processors said the
company had agreed to the study, which would require public input and
could delay the project several months.</TE>
<TE>   "It will finally dispel any and all of the rumors that have been
floating around about the project," said consultant Sylvia Munoz
Schnopp.</TE>
<TE>   If the City Council approved the project without an environmental
study, a lawsuit would surely follow and a judge would probably ask
that a study be conducted anyway, company officials said. The City
Council is set to vote on the issue Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Vehicle Processors told the city that Volkswagen, with
which it has contracted to process cars, may not be able to wait
until the environmental review period is over and might look for a
site in another city. The company had hoped to open its facility by
next spring.</TE>
<TE>   A group of activists has aggressively opposed the processing
plant, demanding a comprehensive environmental study of how it would
affect the nearby Ormond Beach wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rare Birds Threatened</TE>
<TE>   Ormond, which includes some of Ventura County's largest remaining
tracts of undeveloped coastline, is home to a variety of rare and
endangered birds, including the imperiled California least tern and
western snowy plover.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other place where you have the beach, the dunes, the
estuary and the salt marsh all in one place," said Jean Harris, a
local activist who has worked for 20 years to preserve the coastline.
"It can make us the most famous city in the area if we protect Ormond
Beach."</TE>
<TE>   But officials for Pacific Vehicles maintain that the site is not a
wetland and is far enough from the coast that it would not harm the
wildlife. They also point out that the facility would create 250 jobs
and beautify land that is mostly a mass of weeds and trash.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it is going to be the link to revitalizing south
Oxnard, an area that so desperately needs it," Schnopp said.</TE>
<TE>   Workers at the plant would wash, repair and accessorize 100,000
cars imported from Mexico and Germany every year. The vehicles would
remain parked at the facility until they are loaded onto trucks and
trains and delivered to showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic and bright lights generated by the plant are also a
concern to a small group of families who recently purchased homes in
the Pacific Cove housing development across the street. Some of the
homes, which went on sale in June and range from $380,000 to
$420,000, could be directly affected.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other city that would consider something like this,"
new homeowner Ben Martinez said at a recent council meeting. "It
doesn't make sense to build a parking lot across the street from a
beautiful coastal scene."</TE>
<TE>   The project has its supporters, who point out that Ormond Beach is
already home to a power plant, a sewage treatment facility, a metal
recycler and a paper mill.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the jewel of Oxnard?" asked Ventura Fernandez as he stood
near the metal recycling plant. The longtime south Oxnard resident
said he is frustrated with environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time somebody wants to do something nice that'll bring
jobs, they stop it. You think people are going to come from L.A. to
see this?"</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely, Harris said. Once the wetlands are preserved and
properly restored, nature lovers will come from all over California.
What's more, the land next to the wetlands, including the proposed
car processing site, plays a role in this ecosystem, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Mayor Pro Tem John C. Zaragoza said he expects the City
Council to require an environmental study.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a balanced approach, because that's the last big open
space near the ocean and we need to take care of that," Zaragoza
said. "We also need jobs and we need to support our people."</TE>

<HD>Quake-Ravaged Frescoes of Assisi Pieced Together</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ASSISI, Italy</DL>
<LD>St. Jerome's white beard is largely gone, his rich cloak looks like
it was devoured by moths, and the roll of writing paper on his desk
has disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   But in a kind of restoration miracle, much of the rest of a
renowned Giotto fresco is back on the soaring ceiling of St. Francis
Basilica, five years after an earthquake sent the masterpiece
crashing to the floor in tens of thousands of fragments.</LD>
<LD>   The fresco was painstakingly pieced back together by a team of
restorers, who celebrated their achievement Thursday as this town
marked the fifth anniversary of a pair of powerful quakes that
claimed 10 lives and destroyed homes and artwork across Umbria, in
central Italy.</LD>
<TE>   The race to save the fresco, which experts believe was painted by
Giotto at the end of the 13th century, began almost immediately after
a huge chunk of the basilica's nave fell a distance of seven stories
in the earthquake, burying two Franciscan monks and two workers in a
mound of dust, plaster and bricks on Sept. 26, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   After the bodies were pulled out, volunteers and restoration
experts, who slept in a tent camp with some of the thousands left
homeless in the quake, started sifting through some 50,000 fragments
of the fresco of St. Jerome and pieces of lesser-known frescoes of
eight other saints.</TE>
<TE>   They tried to match pieces to an enlarged photograph of the
originals and carefully laid unmatched pieces on cushions of foam in
crates and drawers.</TE>
<TE>   "Days would pass when people would find nothing or maybe just a
little piece," recalled one of the chief restorers, Paola
Passalacqua. "Then suddenly we would remember seeing a certain piece
in a certain drawer that matched. It was a work of memory."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the ceiling above the altar also came crashing down in the
second of the quakes, including another masterpiece, a fresco by
Cimabue, considered the father of Italian painting.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration work on some 120,000 fragments of Cimabue's St.
Matthew will begin in a few months, aided by a computer that will try
to find matches between the pieces and a photograph of the
masterpiece. Fragments of the Cimabue now fill 880 drawers in a
cloister of the Franciscan basilica's convent.</TE>
<TE>   A computer might have helped with the Giotto fresco, but right
after the quake there was no time to tailor programs for it,
Passalacqua said.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after the quake, the art world debated if the wrecked
frescoes should be mounted in a museum if not enough pieces were
found to be put back on the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   But piece by piece, a lot of the puzzle started to be filled in:
St. Clare's nose in a cycle of Giotto-school frescoes depicting a row
of saints; St. Jerome's book, his two-peaked hat, his penetrating
eyes and reed-thin nose, some of his burgundy-colored cloak and a few
wisps of his wavy beard.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Enzo Fortunato gazed up Wednesday at St. Jerome and the
other eight saints near the entrance and said: "When we could see the
face of St. Rufino, his eyes, beard, a cheek, then real hope began
for us." At a kind of thanksgiving ceremony Thursday, the Franciscan
custodian of the basilica complex, the Rev. Vincenzo Coli, told the
restorers who will work on the Cimabue: "We're faithfully waiting for
another miracle of faith and of the capabilities of man."</TE>
<TE>   The upper level of the two-tiered basilica, where the frescoes are
located, was reopened to the public in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "When pilgrims come in, they point to where the Cimabue fresco was
and say, 'That's where the quake damage was,' " Fortunato said.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors don't realize the St. Jerome fresco also was
quake-damaged, its missing details taken for a casualty of passing
centuries--a true indication, Fortunato said, of the restoration's
success.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A band of prominent evangelicals in the Church of England has
demanded that Archbishop Rowan Williams either recant his liberal
views on homosexuality or resign as the next archbishop of Canterbury
even before he takes the post.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, the archbishop of Wales who is scheduled to succeed
George Carey in the Canterbury archbishopric, is in hot water with
church conservatives over his perceived support for gays, including
his admission that he has ordained a practicing homosexual.</LD>
<LD>   Reform, a 1,500-strong conservative evangelical network, issued a
statement saying Williams should either affirm publicly the Anglican
Church's traditional teaching that all sex outside marriage is
sinful, or step back from the Canterbury post.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Richard Kirker, general secretary of Britain's Lesbian
and Gay Christian Movement, denounced Reform's action: "The
presumptuous, self-righteous tone ... will, I suspect, make them even
more isolated than they already are in the Anglican Church."</TE>

<HD>Youth in U.S. Back Religious Conservatism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's youth are more conservative than older adults on issues
relating to religion and abortion, a study by UC Berkeley has found.</LD>
<LD>   A report released this week by the school's Survey Research Center
found that while 59% of adults ages 27 to 59 would like public
schools to permit prayer at commencements and other official school
activities, 69% of teenagers support school prayer.</LD>
<LD>   "We were surprised by the great support among young Americans for
some aspects of the conservative cultural agenda," said Merrill
Shanks, a political science professor at UC Berkeley and a lead
researcher of the study. "Young Americans show more conservatism on
religious politics and abortion even though youths, as a group,
appear to be less likely than their elders to attend religious
services regularly or consider religion a guide in their daily life."</LD>
<TE>   Forty percent of adults ages 27 to 59 support federal funding of
faith-based charities, but 59% of college-age respondents and 67% of
younger teens said they supporte such aid.</TE>
<TE>   Limitations on abortion also have more support from younger
Americans. Roughly one-third of those surveyed over the age of 22 say
they support restrictions on abortion. But among those aged 15 to 22,
44% say they would favor restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The report, part of the Survey Research Center's Public Agendas
and Citizen Engagement Survey, is based on interviews of about 1,250
people.</TE>

<HD>Shroud Restoration Sparks Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Restoration work carried out in secret on the Shroud of Turin during
the summer has set off heated debate between the custodian of what
many consider Christianity's most sacred relic and scientists
studying its authenticity.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Severino Poletto said at a news conference in Turin that
experts had "rejuvenated" the shroud, which is preserved in a
bulletproof aluminum and crystal casket in the city's Cathedral of
St. John.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe they were well intentioned. I also believe that they
made a terrible mistake," William Meacham, a University of Hong Kong
archeologist, said at another news conference in Rome.</LD>
<TE>   Many Christians revere the 17-foot-long linen sheet, which bears
an outline that resembles a photographic negative of the body and
face of a bearded man. Those who believe the shroud is authentic say
it is the winding-sheet in which Jesus was wrapped after his
crucifixion. Two million people filed past the shroud in 2000 when it
was last put on public display.</TE>
<TE>   During 40 days of work completed on July 25, experts removed
patches that Clarisse nuns sewed on the cloth after it was damaged in
a fire in the French Cathedral of Chambery in 1532. They replaced its
backing of holland fabric, also dating to the 16th century, and
vacuumed up particles of pollen, burnt cloth and other impurities.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has been lost," Cardinal Poletto said, "because
everything that was removed--particles and threads--was cataloged and
conserved. It will be an object of study."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, when the holland was removed, both sides of
the shroud were scanned digitally for the first time, measurements
and other observations were painstakingly recorded and photographs
were taken at each step of the work.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Giuseppe Ghiberti, president of the conservation
commission, said experts had been recommending since 1969 that the
holland, a stiff cloth sometimes used in book binding, be replaced to
help preserve the cloth. The old fabric will be displayed in a
museum.</TE>
<TE>   But Meacham, who has studied the shroud since 1981, called the
work "radical and invasive" and said it was begun without sufficient
consultation. He said the removal of particles will seriously hamper
scientific investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no urgent threat to the shroud," he said. "Most
conservators would have recommended doing nothing at all, especially
avoiding excessive handling, stitching, unstitching and exposure to
light."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Heinrich Pfeiffer, a Jesuit professor of early Christian
art at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and member of the
Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church, also
questioned the need for the work.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never heard that carbonized particles could damage the
healthy parts of a fabric after a fire put out centuries ago,"
Pfeiffer said.</TE>

<HD>Mother Teresa Passes First Point to Sainthood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mother Teresa reportedly passed her first major milestone on the road
to sainthood in record time this week when the Vatican Congregation
for the Causes of Saints approved her "heroic virtues."</LD>
<LD>   The Italian news agency ANSA said the congregation will meet again
Oct. 1 to consider a miraculous cure attributed to her intervention.
Proof of a miracle would qualify her for beatification, the step just
before sainthood.</LD>
<LD>   If the Vatican continues to act with the unusual speed it has
displayed so far, the way would be clear for Pope John Paul II to
declare Mother Teresa blessed early next year.</LD>
<TE>   The congregation based its action Tuesday on 5,000 pages of
documentation on Mother Teresa's life collected in five volumes. The
information before the cardinals and bishops summarized testimony
from 113 witnesses and documents collected by 15 investigators in 80
volumes totaling 35,000 pages.</TE>
<TE>   Mother Teresa's cause got a head start when the pope waived the
five-year waiting period normally required between a death and the
opening of a process toward sainthood. The Vatican announced his
action on March 1, 1999, less than 18 months after her death on Sept.
5, 1997, at age 87.</TE>
<TE>   The miracle attributed to Mother Teresa is the healing of an
Indian woman who suffered from an abdominal tumor.</TE>
<TE>   If it is given final approval by the pope, Mother Teresa's name

<HD>Talk of War Against Iraq Divides Religious Leaders</HD>
<DH>Debate: Arguments focus on concept of a 'just war.'
Catholic bishops, among others, oppose a first strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As talk of likely war with Iraq continues to dominate public
discussion, religious leaders in the United States and Europe are
divided over whether an attack on the government of Saddam Hussein
would meet the criteria of a "just war."</LD>
<LD>   In the Western tradition, the principles of jus ad bellum, a just
war, have evolved over several centuries of theological and
philosophical argument based on Roman philosophy and religious
teaching as well as international law, traditions of chivalry, and
hard lessons learned in battle.</LD>
<LD>   A war can be waged only as a last resort by a legitimate
authority, not individuals, the just war doctrine states.</LD>
<TE>   There must be a just cause for the hostility. The intention must
be to restore justice and peace, not to seek vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   There must be a reasonable chance of success because deaths and
injury in a hopeless cause are not morally justifiable. Military
force must be proportionate to the good likely to be achieved. Those
waging the war must discriminate between combatants and
noncombatants.</TE>
<TE>   The doctrine has never been universally accepted. Some pacifist
religious traditions reject the entire concept. "There is no such
thing as a just war, just as there is no just slavery or just racism.
War simply is not just," said the Rev. J. Edwin Bacon Jr., rector of
All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "War is growing to the point of being able to deceive people of
faith with a lie, an untruth that you can bless war as being just or
that you can call war godly."</TE>
<TE>   But even among the larger number of clerics and theologians who
accept the idea in theory, no agreement exists about which wars
qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like a mathematical formula where you chunk in some
numbers and get an answer," said Mark Edward DeForrest, an instructor
at Gonzaga University who has written on the subject. "It's much more
a way of thinking about something than a way that leads you to a
conclusive answer in any given situation."</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics argue that clerics base their views of war more on their
political beliefs than on their theology. But whether that is so or
not, American leaders have often sought the sanction of religious
leaders before asking soldiers to go into battle.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, for example, "Praise the Lord and Pass the
Ammunition," a hit tune born of a chaplain's prayer during the 1941
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, underscored religious backing for
that war.</TE>
<TE>   In the current situation, religious views so far are widely
divergent.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Catholic bishops, for example, backed President Bush in
pursuing war in Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11.
Now they are challenging the "moral legitimacy" of a preemptive war
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe Iraq is a different case," Bishop Wilton D. Gregory,
president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote the
president last week. "Given the precedents and risks involved, we
find it difficult to justify extending the war on terrorism to Iraq,
absent clear and adequate evidence of Iraqi involvement in the
attacks of Sept. 11 or of an imminent attack of a grave nature."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Richard Land, a leading voice in the Southern Baptist
Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, said
"attacking Iraq is permissible, because it meets the criteria for a
just war."</TE>
<TE>   Saddam Hussein is a threat to American security, Land added.</TE>
<TE>   "Can anyone doubt that when he has developed nuclear weapons and
other weapons of mass destruction he will use them against America
and her allies?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Land compared Hussein to Adolf Hitler, and warned that a failure
to remove him from power now would be comparable to the Allies'
failure to oppose Hitler early on.</TE>
<TE>   In Great Britain, which has backed the Bush administration's Iraq
policy, bishops of the Church of England disagreed about the justice
of a war during a debate in the House of Lords.</TE>
<TE>   Some religious statements about peace appear to be out of touch
with the realities of the world, said Bishop Richard Chartres of
London.</TE>
<TE>   "Such hyper-moralism lacks practical wisdom," he said. "We are in
a situation in which the old doctrines of deterrence have been
undermined by the character of modern terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Though war is "always a failure" and nations must avoid causing
suffering to innocents, "in view of the destructiveness of the tools
available to modern terrorists and states, the use of preemptive
strikes where a well-proven threat exists should not, a priori, be
ruled out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chartres, added, however, that the United Nations must be involved
in deciding which cases really justify war. "No state, however
powerful, should be left as judge and jury," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other bishops opposed the war, some arguing for pacifist
principles, others saying the evidence of Iraq's misconduct did not
prove that war would be the only feasible policy.</TE>
<TE>   Christians are not alone in their differences. Jewish groups have
been struggling with Bush's new military doctrine that allows for
preemptive, unilateral war by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Rabbinical Council of America, a leading Orthodox group,
supports Bush unequivocally. "The longer we wait, the more problems
that could ensue," said Rabbi Steven Dworken, executive vice
president of the council.</TE>
<TE>   A war with Iraq is "a continuing of a war on terrorism," he said,
adding that Hussein is of the same "genre" as Osama bin Laden. "He
has a regime that could destabilize the entire region and have
repercussions all over the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The executive committee of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, an organization of Reform synagogues, also supports
Bush, but with some caveats.</TE>
<TE>   International cooperation is "far better" than unilateral action,
the organization said, and it emphasized that nonmilitary action is
preferable to war. But it asked only that the Bush administration
explore those options while insisting that it get the approval of
Congress before acting.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Jewish organizations, as well as religious groups of all
denominations, have been struggling with the question of what
guidance their religious traditions offer on this issue," the
executive committee said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the view, war--just and unjust--has been a constant in
human history.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi David Saperstein, director of the Religious Action Center of
Reform Judaism, said this week that a historian calculated that since
the year 1500, there have been only about 30 years in which there was
no significant warfare anywhere in the world.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has signed a bill blocking the export of north coast
river water via huge ocean-going plastic bags until a study is
completed to gauge if fish would be harmed. The plan by Alaska Water
Exports to tap the Gualala and Albion rivers and ship water south has
attracted huge opposition in Sonoma and Mendocino counties.</LD>
<LD>   "These two rivers are north coast jewels that deserve the
protection," Davis said in signing the bill, AB 858, by Assemblywoman
Patricia Wiggins (D-Santa Rosa).</LD>

<HD>Valley City Backers Move to Fill Campaign Gaps</HD>
<DH>Secession: Candidates and homeowner and business groups
deal with loss of consultants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIME STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secession candidates, homeowners' organizations and business groups
moved Friday to fill the gaps left by the San Fernando Valley
cityhood drive's loss of its professional campaign consultants this
week.</LD>
<LD>   The newly formed United Valley Candidates and the powerful Valley
Industry and Commerce Assn. said they will raise money for the
cash-hungry secession campaign. Also, the San Fernando Federation, a
coalition of 12 Valley homeowners' groups, announced its support for
secession, and a key Realtors' group endorsed Mel Wilson, a candidate
for mayor of a new Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   "It's back to a grass-roots campaign," said Michael Cohen, who is
running for city council in the proposed municipality.</LD>
<TE>   It remains to be seen, however, whether this combination of
earnest political novices, homeowners and area business leaders can
pull the secession movement out of the doldrums. The cityhood backers
are up against opponents with at least $3 million to spend and
sophisticated campaign managers.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Steinberg, a Republican political strategist who has
advised the secession campaign in the past, said he is skeptical that
activism alone can win the election at this late date.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire the fortitude and the persistence," Steinberg said. "But
the election is [five] weeks away and the grass-roots should all be
done. This is the time you should be building on your grass-roots and
using your advertising."</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, who is running the campaign against secession, said he
believes secession can win with just grass-roots support. But he
questioned whether enough people will pitch in to reach the roughly
400,000 voters who some experts believe will be needed for secession
to win Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   United Valley Candidates, a group of about 25 people who are
running for office in the proposed new city, filed papers Friday with
the Los Angeles Ethics Commission to form a campaign committee, which
can legally raise funds and must report the money that it raises.</TE>
<TE>   "We will aggressively campaign all over the city, and aggressively
spread the message that Valley cityhood is good for everyone," said
one of the group's organizers, Frank Sheftel, who is running for the
proposed Valley city council.</TE>
<TE>   The group's members will join Valley mayoral candidate Wilson in a
walkathon for Valley independence Oct. 5. But members said they plan
to use any money raised for their own pro-cityhood events and
advertisements, rather than donate funds to the broader secession
effort run by the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   With that campaign falling short of fund-raising goals, the Valley
Industry and Commerce Assn. said Friday it will launch a separate
money drive to pay for its own campaign to persuade business owners
to vote for the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to solicit our members for fund-raising," said Fred
Gaines, chairman of VICA. "Our advocacy on this is going to be
focused on businesses and business issues."</TE>
<TE>   He estimated the drive would raise less than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines said the money will pay for fliers to be distributed to
businesses throughout Los Angeles, as well as newspaper
advertisements and, possibly, radio and television spots.</TE>
<TE>   Also stepping up its involvement in the race is the Southland
Regional Assn. of Realtors, which endorsed Wilson. The association
endorsed secession earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a past president of the organization and its lobbyist,
"has the negotiating experience, organizational skills and personal
power needed to improve the quality of life in the San Fernando
Valley," said Olga Moretti, president of the 7,300-member
association.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one of Wilson's nine opponents in the mayor's race,
Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), will get a boost Thursday
when Valley car dealer Bert Boeckmann and attorney David Fleming hold
a fund-raiser at the Universal Sheraton for his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Their participation in a fund-raiser for Richman doesn't
necessarily mean that other candidates won't benefit from the
businessmen's largess. Boeckmann has said he will hold fund-raisers
for others. Wilson said Boeckmann promised to "help me out, too."</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Bucks Trend, Shreds Files</HD>
<DH>Law: City prosecutors cite storage limitations for
destruction of closed criminal files. Lawyers in other jurisdictions
express surprise at the practice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Inglewood city attorney's office has been routinely destroying
its criminal files once cases are closed, a practice unheard of in
almost all other Los Angeles County prosecutorial offices.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys at most prosecutorial offices say they are duty-bound to
maintain records on criminal cases--current or closed--for several
years.</LD>
<LD>   But Inglewood Assistant City Atty. Kenneth Campos said his office
simply does not have room to keep all criminal case files.</LD>
<TE>   "Our office is too small," he said. "We have a shredder, and
everything goes into it."</TE>
<TE>   Campos said his office can always review the court file or ask the
Inglewood Police Department for its records.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance City Atty. John Fellows said his office also destroys its
criminal files once there is a conviction or an acquittal, saying it
is a storage issue.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Los Angeles and Pasadena city attorney's offices
said they retain criminal records for 10 years, Burbank for seven
years, and Long Beach for two to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "We err on the side of keeping them a long time," said Santa
Monica City Atty. Marsha Moutrie, whose office keeps records for 15
years on closed domestic violence cases and 10 years on all other
criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Moutrie said it is critical to retain criminal records because
many defendants are repeat offenders.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires the retention of city records for at least two
years unless an electronic copy is made, several municipal attorneys
said. Duplicates of the records may be destroyed if they no longer
are required, according to the government code.</TE>
<TE>   But city attorneys said they often produce notes or records that
are not duplicated and may be needed down the line.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office typically
retains misdemeanor records at least two years and felony files--many
on microfiche--dating back to the 1960s, said head Deputy Dist. Atty.
Stephen Kay.</TE>
<TE>   "They become historical files, and you never know when you are
going to need something," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After Inglewood Police Officers Jeremy Morse and Bijan Darvish
were indicted by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury in July in
connection with the videotaped beating of a 16-year-old boy, the
county public defender's office requested the case names and numbers
of all cases that involved the two officers.</TE>
<TE>   The request was made to the Inglewood city attorney and the Los
Angeles County district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The office also asked the Inglewood Police Department for the
numbers of any police reports that named Darvish, Morse and two other
officers who were present during the July 6 incident.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Randall Rich said the pending criminal
charges against Darvish and Morse raise questions about other cases
in which the officers either took part in an arrest or investigation,
or were witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Morse is charged with assault under the color of authority and
Darvish is charged with filing a false police report. The office
plans to review the old cases to see if those defendants have grounds
for new trials or be declared factually innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Because the public defender's office does not have a database
connecting police officers to defendants, Rich said, the office
relies on law enforcement agencies to provide that information.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office handed over a list of the 60 felony
cases involving Morse and the 57 cases involving Darvish.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood city attorney's office gave the public defender's
office the names and numbers of open cases in which the two officers
were involved and in which the public defender was the attorney.
There were fewer than 10 such cases. The closed case files had been
destroyed, Campos said. Misdemeanor cases are usually completed
within three months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Campos responded to the records request by the public defender's
office with a letter that read: "The Inglewood city attorney's office
does not maintain any files that are not pending in criminal court.
All closed files are shredded when the case is completed."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Campos said, it would be too burdensome to review the
court files or the Police Department records to see which old cases
involved the two officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood city attorney's office prosecutes more than 5,000
misdemeanor cases each year.</TE>
<TE>   Campos also said that the public defender does not have a right to
the cases in which it did not serve as the attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the public defender is trying to find something we
can't help them with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rich, the deputy public defender, said the fact that the Inglewood
city attorney destroys its files so quickly is "just astounding."</TE>
<TE>   The public defender's office plans to continue pressuring the city
attorney's office for the records, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the city attorney may not have the information does
not mean the information does not exist," Rich said.</TE>
<TE>   And regardless of whether the public defender's office gets
cooperation from Inglewood, he said, "We'll do whatever we can to
ensure that our clients' files are reviewed."</TE>

<LD>At 83, Bernard Stelzer and his wife, Edith, have found heaven, living
a sunny life in Orange County's largest retirement community.</LD>
<LD>   Yet last month, a package from the Swiss Embassy in Washington
transported Stelzer back in time, to painful events of World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Enclosed was a letter from Lt. Col. Ueli Weber of Swiss Army
Rescue Battalion 35, photographs and newspaper stories in German.</LD>
<TE>   "I was shocked," said Stelzer, a department store manager who
retired to Leisure World in Laguna Woods.</TE>
<TE>   The letter suggested that Swiss authorities thought the enclosed
material would be of interest to him. Stelzer couldn't read the
newspaper stories but could surmise from the photographs that they
had unearthed the remnants of Bim Bam Bola, the B-24 Liberator bomber
he flew on in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   It was July 12, 1944, five weeks after the invasion of Normandy.
At the break of day, the 24-year-old native New Yorker, a gunner
stationed in southeastern England, woke up and hurried to his morning
briefing. He and his crewmates were to fly one of the more than 1,100
bombers that took off that day on a mission to bomb Munich.</TE>
<TE>   From this point on, accounts of the mission conflict. The son of
one crew member who now is dead says the men finished their mission
and were shot down over Switzerland as they returned.</TE>
<TE>   Stelzer remembers it very differently. He says that the captain
ordered the crew to jump out before it reached Munich.</TE>
<TE>   He strapped on his parachute and jumped. He crashed into a thickly
wooded area on the eastern side of Lake Constance, along the border
of Switzerland and Austria, suffering injuries that earned him a
Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   After landing, Stelzer left his dog tags in the trees. "I was
scared to death. I am Jewish," Seltzer said.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly fell into the hands of the Nazis. He suffered 11 months
of meager food, humiliation and forced marches until the end of the
war.</TE>
<TE>   The plane went on to crash into the Alps, smashing into splinters
on a hillside near Prattigau in eastern Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 60 years later, silvery scrap metal began to sprout as ice
melted in the Riederen alpine nature preserve and the Bim Bam Bola
resurfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Over three weeks in July, about 20 men from the Swiss equivalent
of the U.S. National Guard, led by Weber, excavated the site.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, Stelzer saw the excavation as a chance to learn more
about the crash and to help dispute accounts that the plane had been
shot down.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the couple traveled to Washington to visit the Swiss
Embassy and U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) to ask for
help.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anything," Stelzer said. "Just answers. Maybe a
bullet or something."</TE>
<TE>   The answers may prove elusive. But through the efforts of Cox,
Swiss authorities have agreed to send Stelzer a piece of the plane as
a memento of those difficult months overseas.</TE>

<HD>The Bim Bam Bola Mystery</HD>
<DH>Veteran: Bernard Stelzer, a gunner on the WWII bomber dug
up in Switzerland in July, disputes its downing.</DH>

<LD>At 83, Bernard Stelzer and his wife, Edith, have found heaven, living
a sunny life in Orange County's largest retirement community. Not
much concerns the unflappable Stelzer, who spends his days going to
the gym and attending shows and lectures.</LD>
<LD>   Yet last month, a package from the Swiss Embassy in Washington
transported Stelzer back in time, to painful events of World War II.
It also galvanized him to find out more about a mysterious incident
that put him in a POW camp for nearly a year.</LD>
<LD>   Enclosed was a letter from Lt. Col. Ueli Weber of Swiss Army
Rescue Battalion 35, photographs and newspaper stories in German.</LD>
<TE>   "I was shocked," said Stelzer, a department store manager who
retired to Leisure World in Laguna Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "When he got all of this, he fought the war all over again," added
Edith, his wife of 61 years.</TE>
<TE>   Though vague, the letter suggested that Swiss authorities thought
the enclosed material would be of interest to him. Stelzer couldn't
read the newspaper stories but could surmise from the photographs
that they had unearthed the remnants of Bim Bam Bola, the B-24
Liberator bomber he flew on in World War II before it crashed in the
Swiss Alps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Last Mission</TE>
<TE>   It was July 12, 1944, five weeks after the invasion of Normandy.
At the break of day, the 24-year-old native New Yorker, a gunner
stationed in southeastern England, woke up and hurried to his morning
briefing. He and his crewmates were to fly one of the more than 1,100
bombers that took off that day on a mission to bomb Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Nerves were rattled. The Bim Bam Bola had two new men in the crew
that day, replacements for the bombardier and copilot lost on a
mission a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   From this point, accounts of the mission conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The son of one crew member who now is dead says the men finished
their mission and were shot down over Switzerland as they returned to
England.</TE>
<TE>   Stelzer remembers it very differently. He says that the captain
ordered the crew to jump out before it reached Munich. Somehow, the
aircraft had separated from the rest of the fleet. In the clear sky,
Stelzer saw no other planes around him, friend or foe.</TE>
<TE>   He strapped on his parachute and jumped. He crashed into a thickly
wooded area on the eastern side of Lake Constance, along the border
of Switzerland and Austria, suffering injuries that earned him a
Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   After landing, Stelzer left his dog tags in the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared to death. I am Jewish," Seltzer said.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly fell into the hands of the Nazis and became a prisoner
of war. He suffered 11 months of meager food, humiliation and forced
marches until the end of the war. Other than George Klein, the
navigator, Stelzer did not encounter any others from the Bim Bam Bola
during his imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   The plane went on to crash into the Alps, smashing into splinters
on a hillside near Prattigau in eastern Switzerland near the border
of Austria.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Wreck Found</TE>
<TE>   Almost 60 years later, silvery scrap metal began to sprout as ice
melted in the Riederen alpine nature preserve and the Bim Bam Bola
resurfaced. The plane's remains lie in a remote mountainous area near
the village of Klosters, now with an exclusive ski resort.</TE>
<TE>   Over three weeks in July, about 20 men from the Swiss equivalent
of the U.S. National Guard, led by Weber, excavated the site, finding
sheet metal from the cockpit, electronic parts, two machine guns,
ammunition and fragments of four engines.</TE>
<TE>   "The largest pieces, 2 to 3 meters in size, came from the tail,"
Weber said. "The scrap is a part of history that has been forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Large remnants of the aircraft are headed for the Dubendorf
Aircraft Museum near Zurich, Weber said. The rest will be recycled.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, Stelzer saw the excavation as a chance to learn more
about the crash and to help dispute accounts that the plane had been
shot down.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the couple traveled to Washington to visit the Swiss
Embassy and U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) to ask for
help.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anything," Stelzer said. "Just answers. Maybe a
bullet or something."</TE>
<TE>   The answers may prove elusive. There are no indications of
evidence uncovered at the scene that would confirm--or
refute--Stelzer's recollection of how the Bim Bam Bola met its end.</TE>
<TE>   But through the efforts of Cox, Swiss authorities have agreed to
send Stelzer a piece of the plane as a memento of those difficult
months overseas.</TE>

<LD>The Dodger season sits in limbo a little while longer, spinning
around and going nowhere like that Union 76 ball beyond the Dodger
Stadium center-field wall.</LD>
<LD>   There's no more margin for error and nothing left to do but hope.
At this point one Dodger loss or one San Francisco Giant victory
wipes out the Dodgers' bid for a wild-card spot in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers staved off elimination for another day with a home run
by Paul Lo Duca in the bottom of the 10th inning for a 1-0 victory
over the San Diego Padres on Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   I'll give the Dodgers this: They aren't going out like chumps.
They could have locked up like Kevin Brown's back. But they're still
giving us a reason to pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   The least the Dodgers can do is make life tough on the San
Francisco Giants. Hang around long enough to force the Giants to make
a cross-country flight to Atlanta and play a make-up game against the
Braves.</TE>
<TE>   That will happen only if the Dodgers are within a half-game of the
Giants, which is to say if the Dodgers win their next two games and
the Giants lose their last two.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one thing missing from the Dodgers' efforts: a little
something-something from Shawn Green.</TE>
<TE>   It's the stretch drive in the playoff run and Green has only four
home runs and nine RBIs in September. He didn't have an extra-base
hit from Sept. 13 until Sept. 26, and he drove in only four runs
during that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Green's soundtrack is different these days.</TE>
<TE>   The long blasts off his bat used to prompt "Oooooohs," "Aaaaahs,"
and "Whoas!" from the crowd at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Lately it's more likely to be an "Ohhhh," a sigh of resignation as
another fly ball settles into an outfielder's glove. There are even a
few boos when he grounds out and strands baserunners.</TE>
<TE>   Green carried the Dodgers at times this summer, leading them to
the top of the National League West in June.</TE>
<TE>   When the summer was gone, so was Green. He turned into a Stevie
Wonder lyric: "Where were you when I needed you?"</TE>
<TE>   He won't blame the cooler air.</TE>
<TE>   "April and September are a lot tougher here, but if you hit it
good it's going to be a home run," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've hit in spurts all year. And I go through stretches were I
haven't hit them.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been getting hits. Obviously I'd like to hit more home runs,
but you take the hits where you can get the hits."</TE>
<TE>   Green, who is hitting over .300 this month, hasn't been the focal
point of the Dodger story. The slide has primarily been a result of
pitchers getting hurt and pitchers getting shelled. But Green's
struggles are a recurring theme.</TE>
<TE>   You can predict the explanations: He isn't getting anything to
hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the number of times they passed on him and said, 'Hey,
Brian Jordan's beating us tonight,' " Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.
"I mean, the offerings aren't real attractive to where you can do a
whole lot with anything. You have to be patient and wait it out."</TE>
<TE>   And that isn't Green's strong suit.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an aggressive hitter," said Jordan, who bats behind Green.
"They know he's not like the Mark McGwire, Chipper Jones that take
the walks and be patient. He wants to go out there and do it.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to pitch to him. They're going to make him get
himself out."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds once explained his pitiful postseason numbers by
saying that pitchers are going to work their way around the most
dangerous hitters in the playoffs, so they really don't get a chance
to do damage. There's only one thing that undermines that theory, and
the Green explanations: Bonds' 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   The guy sees two or three good pitches a game, if he's lucky, and
he still has 45 home runs, 108 RBIs and a batting average hovering
near .370. He has 20 RBIs in September.</TE>
<TE>   The difference?</TE>
<TE>   "Barry's in a league of his own," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   As for pitchers' avoidance of Green, "We just have to live with
it, deal with it, and other guys as a result of it have an
opportunity," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Giants, it has been Jeff Kent feasting on fat pitches
batting ahead of Bonds in the lineup, while Benito Santiago has been
taking advantage of the RBI opportunities that come with hitting
behind him.</TE>
<TE>   For the Dodgers, Green's struggles have been somewhat balanced by
Jordan taking off. Jordan began Friday night's game batting .330 with
five home runs and 27 RBIs in September.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my month," Jordan said. "August was [Adrian] Beltre's
month. When Greenie's hot, he's hot. When he gets cold, he's cold."</TE>
<TE>   Said Green: "I've seen some [good pitches], I'm just not in a home
run groove right now."</TE>
<TE>   Last night had the distinct feel of an autumn cooling trend. Green
flied to right to end the sixth inning, the final part of a
disappointing sequence that saw the Dodgers waste a leadoff double by
Omar Daal (yes, Omar Daal).</TE>
<TE>   Green also grounded out to the pitcher with runners on first and
second and one out in the bottom of the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca's homer ensured that it wouldn't be remembered as the
final wasted opportunity of 2002 and gave Tracy another night to
praise his ballclub.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't ask anything more of the guys in that room," Tracy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sure it isn't too late to put in a request for some big hits by
Green?</TE>

<LD>Mark Mulder couldn't even watch the end of his 19th victory.</LD>
<LD>   After Mulder pitched seven shutout innings Friday night at
Arlington, Texas, Billy Koch gave up two runs in the ninth and left
the bases loaded in Oakland's 3-2 win over the Texas Rangers one day
after the Athletics clinched the American League West title.</LD>
<LD>   "I was pacing in the clubhouse, then I just quit watching," Mulder
said.</LD>
<TE>   Koch earned his 44th save in 50 opportunities and the Athletics
improved to 89-0 when leading after eighth innings.</TE>
<TE>   With their 101st win, the Athletics remained a half-game behind
New York for a chance at home-field advantage through the AL
playoffs. The Yankees have the edge in the tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   A's shortstop Miguel Tejada was out of the starting lineup for the
first time this season but pinch-hit in the ninth to play in his
430th straight game, the longest active streak in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Baltimore 2--Bernie Williams got his 100th run batted
in, Derek Jeter homered and Andy Pettitte won his fifth straight
start as the Yankees won at Baltimore. Jason Giambi had three hits
and his 119th RBI for the Yankees. It was the 10th consecutive loss
for the Orioles, who are 4-30 since Aug. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Chicago 1--Corey Koskie's two-run homer in the eighth
lifted the Twins at Minneapolis. Joe Mays, in his final tuneup for
the playoffs, pitched six strong innings and retired 15 of his final
16 batters for Minnesota. Mays will start Game 2 of the AL division
series in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 8, Kansas City 3--Jim Thome hit his 51st homer, breaking
Albert Belle's single-season club record, and C.C. Sabathia (13-11)
pitched seven solid innings for the Indians at Cleveland. Kansas
City's Mike Sweeney went one for four and is batting .343 with two
games left in his race with Boston's Manny Ramirez for the AL batting
title. Ramirez is hitting .347 after going one for two against Tampa
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Tampa Bay 1--John Burkett pitched eight strong innings
and Brian Daubach and Nomar Garciaparra drove in two runs each for
the Red Sox at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Detroit 2--Rookie Pete Walker pitched seven strong
innings at Toronto for his 10th win. The Blue Jays have won five
straight and are 56-51 since Manager Carlos Tosca replaced Buck
Martinez on June 3.</TE>

<HD>Happy Hangover for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They get warm welcome after clinching playoff
spot; most regulars sit out loss to Seattle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And, on the day after, they rested.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the Angels did, anyway, one day after they clinched the
team's first playoff berth in 16 years. Manager Mike Scioscia gave
most of the regulars the day off Friday and gave his starting
pitchers the weekend off, and the rest of the roster completed an
enjoyable if thoroughly inconsequential 7-6 loss to the Seattle
Mariners before a spirited sellout crowd of 43,452 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   The heroes wore red, and the names on the back of the uniform did
not matter, at least for one night. The Angels suffered for so many
years, in the shadow of the Dodgers and under the weight of their own
futile history, that the players are genuinely appreciative of the
sudden wave of fan support.</LD>
<TE>   "People believe in us, finally," outfielder Tim Salmon said. "That
says a lot."</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, there were issues to address Friday, off the
field. The players voted how to split their pool of playoff bonus
money. The coaches, scouts and executives met to discuss the playoff
roster and scouting reports on the New York Yankees, the opponent in
a best-of-five series that starts Tuesday. Everyone took home
souvenir caps and T-shirts commemorating the Angels' playoff
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   The bleary-eyed players were more than happy to share stories of
the rowdy celebration Thursday, starting in the clubhouse after
clinching in Texas and continuing at 35,000 feet. But they couldn't
stop expressing their amazement and gratitude for the reception that
awaited them upon their return.</TE>
<TE>   These are the Angels, remember. They have played for so long in a
ballpark where they heard cheers for the Yankees, or the Dodgers, or
the beach balls bouncing onto the field and along the warning track.</TE>
<TE>   For so long, the Angels fell in September, the way leaves fall
from trees. Fans weary of a summer tease gave up hope. Finally, the
Angels stormed through September, and their long-suffering fans
rewarded them.</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels landed at Long Beach Airport Thursday, some 300
fans awaited them. When the buses arrived at Edison Field, at 10
p.m., some 300 more were waiting there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taken me 10 years to see something like that," Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   In between, Anaheim police escorted the buses on the Garden Grove
Freeway, police choppers and a news helicopter circling above,
shining floodlights on the buses. The players tuned in to the live TV
coverage, watching Southern California watch them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to see them cover something like that," pitcher Al
Levine said, "besides a police chase."</TE>
<TE>   There were highlights Friday. Phenom Francisco Rodriguez, in his
home debut, struck out his first four batters, five of seven in all.
Third-string catcher Sal Fasano, in his first inning in the major
leagues this season, threw out two runners, including Ichiro Suzuki.
For Seattle, Edgar Martinez hit the game-winning home run in the 12th
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy said he understood how fans responded
to the Angels, then and now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a California fan myself. I'm the same way," he said. "You
have to win to bring people to the games. You can't blame them.
Everybody wants to root for a winner. Hopefully, this is a start."</TE>

<LD>Carlos Peralta, a billionaire who owns a Mexican League baseball
team, is pursuing the purchase of the Angels from the Walt Disney
Co., two sources close to the sale process confirmed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Peralta is one of Mexico's richest men. His Grupo Industrias
Unidas is a diverse conglomerate whose companies own real estate and
hospitals and produce electricity conductors, armored plating for
cars, bullfighting magazines, tequila, cattle, cellular phones and
shoes.</LD>
<LD>   In March, Forbes magazine listed him among the 400 richest people
in the world and estimated his net worth at $1.3 billion.</LD>
<TE>   He runs the Tigers de Angelopolis, a Mexico City-based team that
is one of 16 in the Mexican League. His late father Alejo, patriarch
of a business empire, founded the Tigers and helped create the
Mexican Baseball Academy.</TE>
<TE>   Major league rules do not prohibit foreign ownership. The majority
owner of the Seattle Mariners, Nintendo owner Hiroshi Yamauchi, lives
in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Disney officials declined to comment. Tigers de Angelopolis
officials, quoted in the Mexican newspaper Reforma as saying Peralta
intended to meet with Disney executives, could not be reached for
comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the wild-card berth clinched and the American League West
championship out of reach, Manager Mike Scioscia decided to rest his
entire starting rotation this weekend. As a result, Jarrod Washburn
will start the first game of the playoffs against the New York
Yankees on Tuesday on eight days' rest, Kevin Appier the second game
Wednesday on seven days' rest and Ramon Ortiz the third game Friday
on eight days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz has thrown 217 innings this year, Washburn 206 and Appier
188, with rookie John Lackey combining for 210 between the Angels and
triple-A Salt Lake. Lackey is tentatively scheduled to start the
fourth game, though the Angels have not ruled out bringing back
Washburn on three days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie reliever Scot Shields made his first major league start
Friday. Mickey Callaway will start today. Aaron Sele, who has not
pitched since Aug. 20 because of a partially torn rotator cuff, will
start Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   September call-up Francisco Rodriguez, 20, who dazzled the Angels
with his 95-mph fastball and wicked slider, is expected to join
Shields, Brendan Donnelly, Scott Schoeneweis, Ben Weber and closer
Troy Percival as relievers on the playoff roster. Among the reserves
expected to be on the playoff roster are designated hitter Shawn
Wooten, infielders Chone Figgins and outfielders Orlando Palmeiro and
Alex Ochoa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will sell tickets for possible league championship
series games at Edison Field starting Tuesday at 9 a.m. Tickets range
from $30 to $75 per game and will be sold at the ballpark, via the
Web site angelsbaseball.com and via the Ticketmaster phone line at
(714) 663-9000. Tickets will not be available at Ticketmaster retail
outlets. If the Angels beat the Yankees, they would play league
championship series games at Edison Field Oct. 11, 12 and, if
necessary, Oct. 13.</TE>

<HD>Woods' Spin Move Not Fooling Anyone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods has taken his share of hits lately. Bob Ryan of the
Boston Globe was the latest to take Woods to task on the eve of the
Ryder Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "He is the master of Tigerspin, the most recent example being the
explanation of his well publicized remarks last week about how 'There
are a million reasons' why he would prefer winning the American
Express tournament to being on the winning side of the Ryder Cup,"
Ryan wrote.</LD>
<LD>   "Tiger needs an additional million dollars about as much as Tom
Hanks needs another Oscar. He had $60 million guaranteed in
endorsements before he even teed it up once on the Tour."</LD>
<TE>   More Woods: "Tiger can have it his way, but not many people are
buying it," Ryan continued. "A more likely explanation is that Tiger
was hit cold with a question he wasn't expecting and answered it the
way he did because he was already trying to downplay the Ryder Cup,
which is not something he enjoys.</TE>
<TE>   "What we heard last week was a gut reaction. What we heard this
week was Tigerspin.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Tiger Woods may already be the greatest golfer of all time,
but there is a significant stain on his resume, and that is his
spotty play in his first two Ryder Cups. He is 1-1 in singles play
and 2-5-1 in duos.</TE>
<TE>   "He has not brought much more to the table than reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the MVP of the 1986 American League playoff
series between the Angels and Boston Red Sox? Hint: It wasn't Dave
Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Mean: Tom Nissalke coached Bison Dele, missing and presumed
dead in the South Pacific this summer, and former Seattle SuperSonic
John Brisker, missing and presumed dead in Uganda in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Bison could be a little standoffish at times," Nissalke told the
Seattle Times. "There were times when it was difficult to reach him.
But with John you saw a lot of meanness. Sometimes he could be
friendly, nice to see you, like that. And other times he was very
hostile looking. He had a mean streak you never saw in Bison."</TE>
<TE>   Royalty meets royalty: Queen Elizabeth II will be escorted by
Wayne Gretzky when she drops the puck for a ceremonial faceoff Oct. 6
at Vancouver's General Motors Place. According to the Toronto Sun,
"The Canucks invited the Queen to take part in the opening faceoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Being unfamiliar with hockey, she did not immediately agree. But
upon learning that the act was purely ceremonial, she accepted the
invitation."</TE>
<TE>   The next night, Gretzky's King jersey will be retired in a
ceremony at Staples Center. The queen is skipping that.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Marty Barrett, Boston second baseman, who batted
.367 with five RBIs and four runs.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News has some
advice for Denver Bronco quarterback Brian Griese, who sprained his
ankle after tripping over his dog while at home Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a cat," Lincicome wrote. "That's his story, and he is
sticking to it. Or to quote tight end Shannon Sharpe when he heard,
'Are you jivin'?' The dog did what? Ate his homework? Really, if we
were making this up we would do a better job than Brian Griese, so he
must be believed."</TE>

<LD>Clipper forward Elton Brand will be sidelined for at least three
weeks after arthroscopic knee surgery on Thursday. Under the
best-case scenario, Brand will sit out all but a few days of training
camp, which begins Tuesday at Palm Desert. His status for the team's
season- opening game Oct. 30 against the Cleveland Cavaliers is
uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   "The normal course of post-operative treatment ... suggests a
three- to four-week recovery period," said Tony Daly, Clipper team
doctor.</LD>
<LD>   Brand suffered a hyperextended right knee while training with Team
USA in preparation for the World Cham- pionships last month. An
initial MRI exam showed no damage, but a second one taken this week
indicated he suffered a tear of the lateral meniscus cartilage. He
underwent surgery in Wilmington, Del., and is scheduled to begin his
rehabilitation exercises next week with trainer Jasen Powell.</LD>
<TE>   In other news, the team signed free agents Tremaine Fowlkes and
Cherokee Parks. Fowlkes averaged 3.4 points and 2.9 rebounds for the
Clippers as a late-season replacement for injured forwards Lamar Odom
and Corey Maggette. Parks averaged 1.5 points and 1.4 rebounds with
the San Antonio Spurs.</TE>

<LD>Kliff Kingsbury threw for a school and Big 12 Conference-record six
touchdowns Friday night as Texas Tech routed New Mexico, 49-0, in a
nonconference game at Albuquerque, a performance that had Lobo Coach
Rocky Long simmering.</LD>
<LD>   Kingsbury guided the Red Raiders (3-2) to four scores in a row in
the first half, including three in the second quarter. He completed
41 of 59 passes for a season-high 407 yards and played into the
fourth quarter, long after the outcome was decided.</LD>
<LD>   Long charged that the Red Raiders were trying to improve
Kingsbury's Heisman resume at the expense of the Lobos (2-4).</LD>
<TE>   "They're into stats, they're into how many yards he can throw
for," said Long, a former UCLA assistant. "They're trying to win him
the Heisman Trophy. They'll never win it, but they're trying.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a Heisman Trophy candidate, and you've got a team
down and you're drilling them, you'll try to improve his stats so he
looks good on the national wire."</TE>

<DH>Dodgers: Lo Duca's home run in the 10th beats Padres, 1-0,
after Daal's strong effort, but Giants' victory removes any margin
for error.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Lo Duca sent San Diego reliever Jeremy Fikac's first pitch of
the 10th inning deep into the left-field pavilion Friday night, a
home run that thrust the Dodgers to an emotion-filled 1-0 victory
over the Padres before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 45,801 and sparked a
wild celebration at home plate.</LD>
<LD>   The party didn't last long.</LD>
<LD>   As soon as the Dodgers reached their clubhouse, San Francisco
closer Robb Nen put the finishing touches on the Giants' 2-1 victory
over the Houston Astros, reducing San Francisco's magic number to
clinch the National League wild-card berth to one.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have won five of six games--each victory coming
in their final at-bat--have to win their final two games against the
Padres today and Sunday, and the Giants, who have won six in a row
and are 2 1/2 games ahead of the Dodgers, must lose twice to the
Astros to merely force a trip to Atlanta for a makeup game against
the Braves on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   One more San Francisco victory or one more Dodger loss will
eliminate the Dodgers from playoff contention.</TE>
<TE>   "It stunk," left fielder Brian Jordan said of the emotional U-turn
the Dodgers took after the game. "All that joy, and then to come in
here and see San Francisco win. Man ... [today] is gonna be a big
day."</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers are to live to see Sunday, they'll need another
step-up performance today from pitcher Kevin Beirne and a strong
start from Houston rookie Kirk Saarloos, a former Cal State Fullerton
standout.</TE>
<TE>   And if the Dodgers manage to avoid elimination today, they will be
buoyed by the fact that Astro ace Roy Oswalt will be shooting for his
20th victory Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to keep putting pressure on the Giants," Lo Duca said.
"We want to make these games meaningful and they are, but it's
frustrating. We're playing well, and they keep winning. What are you
gonna do?"</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, Jordan and pitcher Omar Daal did just about everything
they could to keep the Dodgers' slim playoff hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan made a leaping catch of Wilbert Nieves' third-inning drive
above the wall in left field, robbing Nieves of a home run, and Daal,
rebounding from a four-start funk in which he gave up 17 earned runs
and 28 hits in 15 innings, threw eight shutout innings, limiting the
Padres to two hits and striking out three.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, finding the rhythm and control that had eluded him since
late August, had to be near perfect because San Diego starter Adam
Eaton, whose start was moved up when Brett Tomko was scratched for
the second consecutive day because of neck pain, was Daal's equal,
giving up three hits over seven shutout innings and striking out
eight.</TE>
<TE>   But Daal got better support from his bullpen--closer Eric Gagne
(4-1) threw two scoreless innings to gain the victory--and his
defense. With runners on first and third and one out in the fourth,
Daal made a lunging grab of Ryan Klesko's smash to the mound and,
from his knees, threw to second to start an inning-ending double
play.</TE>
<TE>   And Jordan, who has played most of the season with an aching left
knee that will require surgery after the season, was somehow able to
elevate himself above the wall despite jumping a little too early on
Nieves' drive in the third.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to use my Michael Jordan hang time," Jordan said.
"Adrenaline got me up there. The way these guys were pitching, I knew
it would be a close game. That guy Eaton was like Cy Young. What got
into him?"</TE>
<TE>   Eaton had a no-hitter until Mark Grudzielanek singled with two out
in the fifth inning. The right-hander then escaped the sixth despite
Daal's leadoff double and the seventh despite the Dodgers putting
runners on first and second with one out.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also loaded the bases with two out in the eighth, but
Eric Karros flied to the warning track in center off reliever Brandon
Villafuerte, and they had runners on first and third with two out in
the ninth before Marquis Grissom flied to center.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who hit into a double play, struck out twice and was hit
by a pitch in his first four plate appearances, stepped to the plate
in the 10th with one thought: If Fikac throws a fastball, pounce on
it.</TE>
<TE>   Fikac obliged, and Lo Duca plastered the pitch, sending it about
halfway up the pavilion for his 10th homer of the season and another
last-gasp victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep battling, and it takes a lot of guts to win these games,"
Lo Duca said. "I'm proud to be a Dodger right now. We're getting good
pitching, great defense, clutch hits. We want to make the Giants win,
make them earn it. Who knows? Strange things happen."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Sinker Allowed Quantrill to Rise to Occasion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Quantrill had an 0-2 record and 9.45 earned run average in his
first six appearances as a Dodger this season, and the vultures on
the radio sports-talk show circuit were howling.</LD>
<LD>   This was the guy who was supposed to be the team's primary setup
man and possible closer? This was the workhorse who had an 11-2
record and 3.04 earned-run average in 80 appearances for Toronto last
season?</LD>
<LD>   First impressions, it turns out, aren't everything. Since his
rocky transition back to the National League, Quantrill has been one
of baseball's most reliable relievers, taking a 5-4 record and 2.74
ERA in a major league-high 85 appearances into Friday night's game
against the Padres.</LD>
<TE>   Quantrill has struck out 52 and walked 25--seven of them
intentionally--in 75 2/3 innings and was tied for the major league
lead with 33 "holds." But the right-hander's most impressive
statistic: He has given up only one home run, to Chicago Cub first
baseman Fred McGriff on May 3.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because I've been able to establish my sinker inside
better against left-handed hitters," Quantrill said. "That way, I
don't have to keep going away, like I did that day against McGriff.
He hit a sinker away--that's his bread and butter. I've done a better
job of keeping them honest, not letting them dive across the plate
much. But the real reason is luck. Dodger Stadium is a big place."</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill is not overpowering. He relies on pinpoint control of
his sinker and thrives on work. The more he pitches, the better he
seems to pitch. Quantrill, who had an 0.87 ERA in 13 games in June,
has limited opponents to a .264 average. He had a 3.12 ERA before the
All-Star break and a 2.23 ERA since then.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are depending on Quantrill to be one of their bullpen
anchors for the next two seasons, but as a player traded in the
middle of a multiyear contract (three years, $9.6 million from
2002-2004) Quantrill can demand to be traded this winter.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't really thought about that," Quantrill, 33, said. "I
come here, I play ball, and I concentrate on that. After the season,
I'll sit down with my family and think about the future."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Marquis Grissom, who had a tying ninth-inning
double in Wednesday's 3-2 win over Colorado and a tying eighth-inning
homer in Thursday's 6-5 win over San Diego, will be a free agent
after the season, and he said he doesn't want to return to the
Dodgers as a fourth outfielder.</TE>
<TE>   But with right fielder Shawn Green and center fielder Dave Roberts
back and left fielder Brian Jordan likely returning, Manager Jim
Tracy doesn't envision an expanded role for Grissom, who entered
Friday with a .275 average, 17 homers and 59 RBIs in 335 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have a similar outfield to what we have now, I couldn't see
that," Tracy said. "But I'm not factoring in health. Do I know for
sure he couldn't get 400-450 at-bats here? I don't know the answer to
that."</TE>
<TE>   What Tracy does know: "Finding someone comparable to Grissom in
that role, a guy with 17 homers and 60 RBIs who brings a lot of other
intangibles, is not easy."</TE>

<LD>Today's $100,000 Pomona Derby is shaping up as the most contentious
stakes race of the meeting, with each of the 10 entrants boasting the
credentials to get the job done in this 1 1/8-mile headliner.</LD>
<LD>   While Paxtecum got the worst of the draw, landing the far outside
slot for his bullring debut, there are several reasons to embrace his
chances at what figures to be a square price in a race filled with
value plays. For starters, the colt showed promise when he began his
career 11 months ago for Mike Machowsky, and even though all that
early work was done on the turf, he's coming off a solid try in the
El Cajon over the main track at Del Mar. He was beaten by a neck in
that mile affair and was coming nicely at the end.</LD>
<LD>   David Flores was aboard Paxtecum for the first time and will do an
encore, and while he doesn't turn up regularly at this venue anymore,
there was a time when he was the king around these parts. Add in the
fact that Paxtecum was making his first start since early January in
last month's Del Mar try and figures to move forward off the effort,
and you have a trio of solid handicapping angles pointing in his
direction.</LD>
<TE>   The aptly named Derby Trial was decided here 12 days ago and Bold
Mango was an emphatic winner of that race over 1 1/16 miles, so you
have to give him respect. Asong For Billy passed that race, but he
had little trouble handling Bold Mango when they met over the Del Mar
turf, so he's going to be dangerous if he takes to this tight course.</TE>

<HD>Califf Moves Past His Kansas City Nightmare</HD>
<DH>Soccer: As a rookie, Galaxy defender cost his team a chance
at MLS Cup, but he has learned well from his mistakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Welcome to Arrowhead Stadium, Danny Califf's personal house of
horrors.</LD>
<LD>   It was here at the end of the Galaxy defender's rookie season that
he hit bottom with a depressing chain of events on the same cool
Missouri evening that not only cost his team a game, but a series
that prevented it from playing for Major League Soccer's
championship.</LD>
<LD>   And whenever Califf returns to the Wizards' home field, he must
deal with the memory of that game, especially tonight when the Galaxy
plays Kansas City in Game 2 of the first-round playoff series. The
Galaxy leads three points to none in the first-team-to-five-points
format (three points for a win, one for a draw).</LD>
<TE>   "It's always in the back of your head every time you go," Califf
said of the play two years ago. "You have highs and you have lows....</TE>
<TE>   "Those are moments where it defines your character. It's kind of a
cliche, but it's not how many times you get knocked down but how many
times you get right back up. That's really what it's all about. ...
It was a pretty bad mistake, but I can't do anything about it now.
I've just had to learn from it and I think I've done pretty well with
it."</TE>
<TE>   It was Oct. 6, 2000, and the surprising Galaxy, seeded fifth,
entered Game 3 of its semifinal series against top-seeded Kansas City
needing only a tie to advance to the MLS Cup for the second
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   The host Wizards, meanwhile, needed the improbable--win the game
and then beat the Galaxy in a 20-minute series tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   A 22nd-minute foul by Califf in the penalty area enabled the
Wizards to win the game, 1-0, on a penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the sixth minute of the sudden-death series tiebreaker,
Califf failed to clear a ball near the top of the 18-yard box. He
tried to trap the ball with his chest before kicking it out, but Mo
Johnston pressured him and stole the ball. Johnston's pass to a
wide-open and on-rushing Miklos Molnar on the right wing allowed
Molnar to easily score the series winner.</TE>
<TE>   While a tearful Califf apologized to his teammates, the Wizards
went on to defeat the Chicago Fire for their first MLS Cup title,
1-0, in their first championship game. The Galaxy is still chasing
its first title after three MLS Cup appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "People have to remember that in that year, Danny was a
20-year-old defender playing in his rookie year in MLS and coming off
the Olympics and everything else," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, the thing that affected our team more than anything going
into that last game was bringing back those Olympic team players, and
that was a hard decision, which way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Califf, Sasha Victorine and Peter Vagenas had just
returned that week from Australia, where they were standouts for the
United States. What also made the experience all the more bitter was
that Califf had been the Galaxy hero in its 2-1 Game 2 victory over
the Wizards at the Rose Bowl, scoring the game-winner with a
golden-goal header in the third minute of overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny ... has matured because that very easily could have been
something that could have stuck in his mind and taken him the wrong
way," Schmid said. "But I think it shows his strength of character
and his resiliency."</TE>
<TE>   Said Califf: "I just had to pick myself up and move on."</TE>
<TE>   The path has led him back to Kansas City.</TE>

first-team-to-five points series, three points to none.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Wizards, who need at least a tie to extend the Galaxy
to a Game 3 Wednesday at the Rose Bowl, crowded in front of their
goal whenever they held a lead in Game 1. "We have to be able to
shoot from distance to pull their defenders out and get around the
wings, spread them out," Galaxy captain Cobi Jones said. "We can't
get frustrated."</TE>

<HD>Fremont Passes Its First Big Test</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fremont knew that its easy nonleague victories over Los Angeles
Hamilton and Bell weren't an accurate indicator of its status as a
City Section title contender. It scheduled San Pedro for that.</LD>
<LD>   The Pathfinders got the test they wanted and rode two touchdown
receptions by Mark Bradford and a tough defensive effort to grab a
16-10 victory over the Pirates Friday night at Fremont.</LD>
<LD>   Except for a few hairy moments in the final two minutes, Fremont
(3-0) kept the game under control. The defense gave up 254 yards but
only 67 came on the ground as it never let San Pedro (1-2) establish
a running game.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very happy with these guys," Fremont Coach Pete Duffy said.
"Especially my guys up front. We knew San Pedro would be an
excellent, well-coached team and we knew we had to be the same way
against these guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates staged a late rally to put the game in doubt.
Quarterback Steve Taylor, who completed 18 of 30 passes for 187
yards, connected on a 35-yard pass play to John Whitt to get the ball
to the Fremont 15-yard line. Four plays later, fullback Deon Bell
scored on a six-yard run on fourth down to cut the lead to 16-10.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Rosas then recovered the onside kick for San Pedro. But on
second down and nine at the Fremont 45, he fumbled the ball after
being hit and the Pathfinders' Thomas Herring pounced on it to end
the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont scored 40 points or more in its two victories and appeared
to be off to a flying start against San Pedro when Eric Jones raced
71 yards on the first play of the game. But the Pathfinders had to
settle for a 30-yard field goal by Ramon Mancia.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford, who has been playing with an injured ankle, caught five
passes for 69 yards. He grabbed an 11-yard touchdown pass from
Michael Beach to put the Pathfinders up 10-0. San Pedro's Mario
Danelo kicked a 23-yard field goal to send the Pirates into halftime
down 10-3.</TE>
<TE>   But in the third quarter, Bradford made the biggest play of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Beach looked for the senior receiver on a post pattern but Pirate
defensive back Darrell Bullock read it perfectly. Bullock stepped in
front of Bradford but let the ball slip through his fingers.
Meanwhile, Bradford kept his eyes on the deflected football and
hauled it in for a 33-yard scoring pass.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Gardena 35, Franklin 24--Turnovers, trick plays and a
triple-threat ground game spelled victory for Gardena in a victory at
Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Franklin, Deandre Hughes and Laferrel Payne combined for 267
total yards and four touchdowns for the Panthers (2-1). Franklin led
all rushers with 110 yards and two touchdowns in 18 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers' other touchdown came on a pass off a fake punt.</TE>
<TE>   Narcisco Diaz led Franklin (2-1) with 421 yards passing and three
touchdowns. He completed 22 of 43 passes, but was sacked eight times
with three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Rafer Weigel</TE>
<TE>   Carson 30, Granada Hills Kennedy 6--Brandon Myles returned the
second-half kickoff 95 yards for a 16-0 lead and Tupu Malele scored
on a 65-yard interception return later in the third quarter for the
host Colts (2-1). Kennedy was held to 29 yards rushing in 28 carries.</TE>

<LD>Adding state championships in football, softball and boys' and girls'
golf will be discussed at a California Interscholastic Federation
meeting Nov. 1-2 in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The CIF Federated Council will have an initial discussion about
adding the sports at the urging of the San Diego Section, which
submitted a proposal to add softball and football state
championships, and the Southern Section, which submitted a proposal
to add golf.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to find out what the climate is now," CIF spokesman Jim
Duel said.</LD>
<TE>   "Are schools open to expanding the season [in these sports] a week
further? Two weeks? What would be the financial impact on schools?"</TE>
<TE>   If initial reaction is favorable, the proposals probably will be
sent down to the two sections for minor readjustments, then
resubmitted at a CIF meeting, at which point a vote would take place.</TE>
<TE>   Duel said it probably would take two or three years to add any
state championships.</TE>
<TE>   State championships are held in basketball, girls' volleyball,
cross-country, wrestling and track and field.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Robert Radnoti of Thousand Oaks High always preached that
the only cross-country meets that matter are the championships at the
end of the season. Running fast early in the season, he believes,
decreases the chances of peaking at the end.</TE>
<TE>   So the fifth-year coach is in a quandary because the Lancer girls'
team has run so well in its first two meets of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Lancers had seven of the top 12 times in the Fastback
Invitational at Mt. San Antonio College on Sept. 14 and five of the
top seven times in the Mt. Carmel Invitational in San Diego last
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative time of their top five runners at Mt. Carmel was
three minutes faster than they ran last year and more than two
minutes faster than a Canyon Country Canyon team that had a
meet-record time Sept. 13 in the Seaside Invitational in Ventura. "I
talked to [Ventura girls' Coach] Bill Tokar the other day and I asked
him what I could do to slow the girls down," Radnoti said. "And he
said, 'Don't. Just keep it fun and enjoy it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks will run in the Stanford Invitational today, but the
Lancers didn't send their top runners to that meet. Their next big
race will be the Kamehameha Invitational in Honolulu next Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Divisional breakdowns for the Southern Section girls' golf
playoffs probably will not be determined until mid-October, section
spokesman Thom Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   Since not all schools participate in girls' golf, neighboring
leagues are sometimes combined. For instance, the Golden West League
has different teams in girls' golf than it does in other sports.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the section office sorts out girls' golf leagues, each
league will be assigned to either the Northern, Central or Southern
divisional championship tournament. The divisional championships are
Nov. 11 and 12. The top four teams in each divisional advance to the
section finals on Nov. 18.</TE>

<HD>Venice Is Stopped Short, 28-27</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A possible game-winning two-point conversion run with no time left on
the clock by Venice High quarterback Eddie Miller came up short and
Santa Monica held on for a 28-27 intersectional victory at Venice on
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, who ran around right end on the conversion attempt,
appeared to have stretched the ball over the goal line with his right
arm, but officials ruled otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   The conversion attempt came after the Gondoliers got within the
final margin on a 26-yard scoring pass from Miller to Antwuan Giddens
as time expired.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a great game," Venice Coach Angelo Gasca said. "We knew we
were going to go for two. We came to win and we took our chance, but
I'm proud of my guys."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica players were proud of themselves as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings hung on thanks largely to senior running back Adrian
Gonzalez, who finished with 162 yards and three touchdowns in 23
carries.</TE>
<TE>   After Venice rallied to take its first lead, 21-20, on a 21-yard
touchdown reception by B.J. Vickers with 3:57 left, Gonzalez gave the
Vikings the lead on a 19-yard touchdown run four plays later with
2:06 to play.</TE>
<TE>   He also scored the Vikings' first two touchdowns on runs of one
and 30 yards in the first half, when Santa Monica took a 20-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The performance was especially satisfying for Gonzalez, who has
two older brothers who graduated from Venice.</TE>
<TE>   "That was incredible," Gonzalez said. "I had one of my brothers
watching on the Venice side. I love the challenge. I was really
pushing for this."</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita 5, L.A. Dorsey 0--Senior linebacker Dustin
Slinkard forced and recovered a fumble late in the first half of
Santa Margarita's victory at Saddleback College, setting up the only
score the Eagles would need in improving to 3-0 for the first time
since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The senior standout stripped the ball from Dorsey quarterback
Donald Prince and recovered it at the Dons' 24-yard line with four
seconds left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Backup kicker Joe Ramsay then converted a 42-yard field goal that
barely cleared the crossbar to give Santa Margarita a 3-0 lead as
time expired. Starting kicker Will Johnson missed his second
consecutive game after suffering an allergic reaction to flu
medication</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles, No. 7 in The Times' rankings, scored their other two
points midway through the fourth quarter when defensive end Josh
Thornberg sacked Prince in the Dorsey end zone. Slinkard preserved
the victory by intercepting a Prince pass at the Santa Margarita 18
with 33 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively, we did what we had to do," said Eagle Coach Jim
Hartigan, whose team recorded its lowest-scoring victory since
beginning varsity competition in 1989. "We're 3-0 and I'll take the
win. But we've got to improve on offense."</TE>
<TE>   Ashton White, held out much of the second and fourth quarters
after taking a hit to the knee, finished with 106 yards in 21 carries
but had his string of 13 consecutive games with a touchdown snapped.</TE>
<TE>   White's inability to score was a result of Dorsey's stingy
defense, which sacked quarterback Case Colaw four times and held
tight every time Santa Margarita ventured deep into Don territory.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't ask for a better effort than our guys gave," Dorsey
Coach Paul Knox said. "Nobody thought we could hold this team to no
touchdowns. We just couldn't move the ball consistently enough."</TE>
<TE>   Running back Jody Rucks was the lone offensive star for the Dons
(1-2), gaining 80 yards in 17 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Encino Crespi 20, Chatsworth 7--The Celts fell behind late in the
first quarter but scored 20 unanswered points as they dominated the
second half at Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   Randle Harris rushed for 120 yards in 15 carries for Crespi (3-0),
which held Chatsworth to 14 yards rushing in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth's Robert Landrum rushed 18 times for 139 yards and
scored on a five-yard run with 56 seconds left in the first quarter
to give Chatsworth (2-1) a 7-0 lead. Landrum rushed for 116 yards in
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   David Barrantes of Crespi intercepted Jason Moss' pass and
returned it 23 yards for a score early in the second quarter and
quarterback Michael Hart scored on a two-yard run three minutes
before halftime to give the Celts a 14-7 lead. Sean Sehnem kicked
field goals of 19 and 22 yards in the fourth quarter to cap the
scoring.</TE>

<DH>Mira Costa, a volleyball power, proves it can play good
football</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surprisingly, Don Morrow held onto the phone when he heard the news,
his composure intact.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone else in his place might have spiked the phone in
jubilation, but the Mira Costa High football coach continued on as if
he were simply chatting about the weather.</LD>
<LD>   The news: The team that had ruined Morrow's championship hopes the
past two seasons, Newhall Hart High, had been bumped to a higher
playoff division. Mira Costa was now heir apparent to the Southern
Section Division III title.</LD>
<TE>   But Morrow wasn't exuberant. Looking back, he says he actually was
miffed.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to play them," Morrow said this week. "We think we have
a team that could compete with them this year."</TE>
<TE>   His primary concern now is keeping Mira Costa at the top of the
Division III rankings, a not-always-simple task at the scenic
Manhattan Beach school.</TE>
<TE>   Hemingway couldn't have found a better place for football than
Mira Costa, where ocean breezes blow wisps of fog through the field
and seagulls pluck at the moist grass on any given fall afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street from the practice field is a church. Down the
road is a flower shop. The Pacific is less than a mile away, as the
seagull flies.</TE>
<TE>   During two-a-day practices, as football players around the
Southland melted in sweltering triple-digit August temperatures, Mira
Costa's players worked out in mostly breezy conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them started to complain," assistant coach Bill Lysle
said. "We said, 'What's there to cry about? It's 74 degrees out
here.' "</TE>
<TE>   The setting is perfect for surfing. Or beach volleyball. Not
necessarily football.</TE>
<TE>   No surprise--before Morrow's arrival in 1993, Mira Costa had never
advanced past the second round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   While the boys' and girls' volleyball teams have made Southern
Section championships an annual affair, the success of the football
team is a relatively new phenomenon at a 51-year-old school where
only five football players in the last 25 years have gone directly to
playing at a Division I college.</TE>
<TE>   "When we step off a bus for a game, 11 out of 13 times people
probably point to us and say, 'They're the ones that are going to
lose,' " Lysle said.</TE>
<TE>   Mira Costa volleyball teams, meanwhile, sent players to USC, UCLA
and Stanford ... in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The football team is well aware of the school's beachy-keen
reputation, in particular the notion that more students would rather
wear wetsuits than a dozen pounds of football gear.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, you're a beach city," quarterback Peter Dobush said.
"Kids play volleyball there. I tell them beach kids can play
football, too."</TE>
<TE>   Wilmington Banning, which has won 11 City Section titles, can
attest to that. Mira Costa downed Banning in a physical nonleague
game Friday, 28-22, at Gardena High.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Okwo rushed for 110 yards and a touchdown in 20 carries
and Mira Costa (3-0) held the Pilots (2-1) to 64 yards in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   A 6-foot, 210-pound linebacker and running back, Okwo certainly
isn't beach sand-soft. A tough, slashing runner, and a heavy hitter
on defense, he has scholarship offers from Stanford, UCLA, USC and
Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Like others around the Mira Costa campus, Okwo credits Morrow for
turning the program around.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow rules by democracy and scores points with his players by
doing such things as allowing them to design their own gadget plays.
One last year--a tailback pass play--was named after a fast-food
restaurant. When the call came into the huddle during a game, the
players broke into a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a dictatorship here," Okwo said. "Sometimes you don't
have the 6-5 guys, the 4.4 40 [-yard dash] guys. Our coach knows we
don't have that, but he works with what he has."</TE>
<TE>   At a practice this week, Morrow, 43, looked as if he could still
be a high school student, wearing khaki shorts, a Hawaiian floral
shirt, sandals and wraparound shades as he walked in and out of the
huddle with a strawberry sucker in one hand, daily practice plan in
the other.</TE>
<TE>   A former Cal State Northridge quarterback, Morrow knows the game.
He graduated in 1977 from Aviation High, the now-defunct school in
Redondo that closed in 1982 because of dwindling enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   He played two years at El Camino junior college and then went to
Northridge, where his highlight was a 20-17 victory against UC Davis
and future NFL quarterback Ken O'Brien in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow's coaching skills took off shortly after he was hired away
from South Torrance. Mira Costa won the Division VII title in 1993,
Morrow's first season, and won the Division IX championship in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, however, the Mustangs were moved up to Division II.
They lost to Diamond Bar in the first round that season and failed to
make the playoffs in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the whispers started. Maybe they're in over their
heads. Maybe those championship victories over Garden Grove Rancho
Alamitos and Monrovia came against inferior competition.</TE>
<TE>   Mira Costa, after moving into Division III in 2000, stormed into
the final with a 12-1 record and faced Hart for the first time. Mira
Costa lost, 34-11, but as they like to say in Manhattan Beach, the
Mustangs trailed at halftime only 17-11.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Mustangs were 12-0 before they again played Hart,
this time in a semifinal. Final score: 35-6. As they like to say in
the South Bay, the game was tied, 0-0, after the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   There's a good reason Morrow and his players aren't thrilled
whenever Hart is mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   "They whooped on us the past couple years," Morrow said with a wry
smile. "There's a running joke that if there's a kid on our campus
wearing red and black, we're going to go after him. I tell my own
sons, 'What are you doing with those black shorts and red shirt? Want
your old man to beat you up?' "</TE>
<TE>   With Okwo, Dobush and bruising fullback-linebacker Kasey Sitchler,
it appears the Mustangs could finally win that elusive Division III
title, 12 seasons after the football program nearly fell into
complete disarray.</TE>
<TE>   Lysle, not Morrow, initially took on the task of keeping the
program together. He was hired as head coach in 1991 and took the job
for one reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Because they couldn't give it away," Lysle said. "It was
terrible. I went in and said I'd only commit one year and I'd try not
to let the team get embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   Lysle ended up staying two years. The team won seven games. Morrow
was hired away from South Torrance. Lysle left quietly.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Morrow had a couple spots to fill on his staff.
He called Lysle in 1996 and asked him to come back to Mira Costa.</TE>
<TE>   Lysle returned, and now coaches the linebackers.</TE>
<TE>   The gang's all here. So is the talent. No surfboards can be seen
in this locker room.</TE>
<TE>   As they like to say around here, this could be Mira Costa's year.</TE>

<LD>Charles Burnley of Valencia rushed for 221 yards and three touchdowns
in 18 carries to propel the Vikings to a 28-26 come-from-behind
victory over Oxnard in a nonleague football game at Canyon Country
Canyon High on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Burnley scored touchdowns on runs of three, 36 and 71 yards in the
second half to help Valencia (2-1) overcome a 20-7 halftime deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Valencia, the No. 23-ranked team by The Times, committed six
turnovers in the first half. But the Vikings scored on their first
three possessions of the second half to take a 28-20 lead after
Burnley's 71-yard run and Leah Shelton's extra-point kick with 8
minutes 29 seconds left in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard, the No. 2 team in the Southern Section Division IV poll,
cut its deficit to 28-26 on a one-yard touchdown run by Aaron Brown
with 2:37 remaining. But the Yellowjackets were penalized five yards
for delay of game before their two-point conversion attempt and then
failed to convert after a Brown pass intended for quarterback Tim
Eglin fell incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who rushed for 213 yards and four touchdowns in 34 carries,
took a pitch from Eglin to start the two-point conversion attempt.
But Eglin never got a chance to catch the ball as Valencia defender
Matt Lien dragged him down from behind. It appeared to be pass
interference, but no penalty was called.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard (2-1) recovered the ensuing on-side kick, but turned the
ball over on downs when Eglin was tackled for a five-yard gain on a
fourth-and-10 play from the Valencia 48-yard line with 1:46 left.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our chances," Oxnard Coach Mark Beckham said when asked
about the apparent penalty on Lien. "You can't pin the defeat on that
one play. I probably shouldn't have gone for it on fourth down like I
did, but I did."</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   Compton Dominguez 24, Inglewood 6--The Dominguez defense forced
four Inglewood turnovers and limited Inglewood, which had averaged
more than 300 rushing yards a game, to only 153 in a nonleague game
between two Division III title contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez quarterback Anthony Wheat turned two of the Inglewood
turnovers into touchdowns with impressive runs. The first was a
34-yard run with 44 seconds left in the first half that gave the Dons
(2-1) a 10-0 lead, and the second came on a 13-yard run that gave
Dominguez a 17-0 lead with 11:10 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood (2-1) had chances late but fumbled at the Dominguez
19-yard line with 8:52 to play and then fumbled near midfield with
4:43 remaining. Dominguez defensive back Timothy Simmons recovered
both fourth-quarter fumbles.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon Jones had the lone score for Inglewood, a seven-yard run
with 43 seconds left in the third quarter that pulled Inglewood to
within 17-6. Jones finished with 44 yards in six carries.</TE>
<TE>   Wheat, a highly-sought college prospect making the transition from
receiver to quarterback, finished with 54 rushing yards in 15 carries
for Dominguez, ranked No. 6 in Division III.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood, ranked eighth in the division, couldn't get its
double-wing offense untracked against a Dominguez defense that
stacked the line of scrimmage with eight players on nearly every
play.</TE>
<TE>   Tempers flared in the second half and both teams were flagged
several times for late hits, illegal blocks and unsportsmanlike
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Hunter, who at the time led Inglewood with 37 yards in seven
carries, was ejected early in the fourth quarter after Dominguez
scored to take a 24-6 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Covina Charter Oak 19, La Verne Damien 14--Charter Oak's' defense
came out strong from the start in the nonleague game at Damien High.</TE>
<TE>   Damien (2-1) turned the ball over five times, including four
interceptions of passes by Mark Belanger, who was making his first
start at quarterback in place of Nick Davila, who left last week's
victory over Rancho Cucamonga with a broken clavicle.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Fuentes returned the last of the interceptions for a
touchdown to give the Chargers (2-1) the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   John Granger had two field goals and Patrick Fuller had two
60-yard kickoff returns that gave the Chargers good field position.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Brondarbit</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Loyola 38, Pasadena Muir 6--Bo Renaud rushed for 142
yards in 25 carries and scored three touchdowns to lead the No. 2
Cubs (3-0), who had four fumble recoveries and three interceptions in
a nonleague victory at Santa Monica College.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Daniels, C. J. Wellinger and Phil Gella contributed
interceptions for Loyola, which opened a 31-0 lead. Quarterback
Richard Irvin completed 28 of 47 passes for 327 yards for Muir (0-3).</TE>
<TE>   Renaud, who has rushed for more than 100 yards in each game this
season, scored on runs of nine, five and 17 yards. Jon Eyraud
recovered a punt snap in the end zone for another Loyola touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Pomona 15, La Puente Nogales 0--Pomona was awarded the victory by
forfeit after a flurry of punches and kicks broke out midway through
the second quarter of the nonleague game at Nogales High.</TE>
<TE>   With Pomona ahead, 15-0, Nogales fullback Matthew Matavao was
penalized three consecutive times for roughing Pomona kicker Noe
Casillas and was ejected for unsportsmanlike conduct. On the
following play, a bench-clearing melee ensued and the officials ended
the game.</TE>

<HD>Los Altos Pulls Away on La Mirada, 41-16</HD>

<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hacienda Heights Los Altos lost a game last week by forfeit, but it
remained unbeatable on the field.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a first half filled with miscues and near-misses, the
Conquerors--ranked 11th by The Times and No. 1 in the Southern
Section Division VI poll--rallied in the second with a near-perfect
half and scored a 41-16 victory over host La Mirada on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Drayton rushed for 59 yards in 14 carries, and three
second-half touchdowns of one, two and two yards.</LD>
<TE>   La Mirada, ranked fourth in the division, dropped to 1-2.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, Los Altos committed four turnovers and La
Mirada capitalized on three, turning them into two touchdowns and a
field goal for a 16-13 lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, Los Altos' defense limited the Matadores to 28
yards. Los Altos finished with a 357-167 advantage in total yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been more proud of a team," said Los Altos Coach Greg
Gano, whose team is 2-1 overall after forfeiting its season-opening
42-21 victory over Menifee Paloma Valley because of an administrative
error. "There were no excuses for the first half. We told them, 'Just
go out and play like you can.' "</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Ordonez completed 11 of 18 passes for 247 yards and an
interception, but he threw for three touchdowns, of 11 and 41 yards
to Caleb Flores and 82 yards to Jeff Castro. Flores caught seven
passes for 131 yards.</TE>

<LD>I was moved to tears by Sunday's article about Maury Wills' newfound
success with the Dodgers, his touching mentoring relationship with
Dave Roberts, and his victory over addiction.</LD>
<LD>   I too have been on that long, hard road as a recovering alcoholic.
While it was not explicitly mentioned in the article, I was doubly
touched that another recovering alcoholic--Don Newcombe--was so
instrumental in bringing Wills back to sanity. One can only wonder at
how many (present company included) have found inspiration in the
courage and brave action that he took in blazing a trail for us to
follow at a time when addiction was not discussed in polite company.</LD>
<LD>   While the Maury Wills story is a wonderful story of redemption
born out of despair, without the bravery of men like Don Newcombe and
the "tough love" of men like Fred Claire, it could have ended much
differently than it did.</LD>

<TE>   I knew Kansas City Royal first base coach Tom Gamboa quite well in
college. I remember him being a sweetheart of a guy who had no life
outside of his passion for baseball. He didn't drink, smoke or party,
like most of the other ballplayers I knew back then. So I didn't buy
the story that he had provoked the attack that night by making an
obscene gesture at the two idiots who assaulted him.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, various commentators have blamed everything from fan
anger about potential baseball labor problems to the unsportsmanlike
behavior of some professional athletes in general for the incident.
The fact is, alcohol is the primary cause and I am appalled that
nobody appears to be addressing this obvious problem. My family
stopped going to sporting events years ago, when fan behavior became
downright dangerous in the stands, not to mention the drive home
after the game. The sooner pro sports gets a handle on this issue,
the sooner families will return to the parks and arenas, and the less
frequently we'll see incidents like the one that happened to Tom
Gamboa.</TE>

<TE>   While I sympathize with the Darr and Johnson families on their
losses ["Friends to the End," Sept. 25], I hope I'm not the only one
who noticed that Mike Darr's blood-alcohol level was 0.11 and that
neither young man was using his seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   I have questions. Were Duane Johnson and Ben Howard sober? And if
they were, why didn't one of them get behind the wheel? Didn't anyone
say to Darr, "You've had a few drinks? Shouldn't we all, at least,
buckle up?" What if Darr had hit another vehicle?</TE>
<TE>   When will we learn?</TE>

the flag at Iwo Jima, but the photo of Benji Gil [Sept. 26] with a
huge wad of spit drooling from his lips was definitely a shining

<HD>Reaching the Playoffs Isn't Vintage Angels</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Friday I decided to give the seemingly playoff-bound Angels the
type of celebration they deserve, so I bought a bottle of Dom
Perignon.</LD>
<LD>   Let me give you some advice: Never ice a bottle of Dom five times
before drinking it.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Gagliano</LD>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although my expensive bottle was ruined, it was still sweet to the
last drop. Cheers to the Angels!</TE>
<TE>   I just read the coverage of the Angels' playoff-clinching victory
and was bewildered at the absence of the one person most responsible
for turning the franchise around, namely Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, these are not your father's Angels and one of the main
reasons they're not is the leadership qualities of Scioscia. He was
the same way when he was a catcher with the Dodgers, and why that
organization didn't see management material in him (remember Bill
Russell, anyone?) is beyond me.</TE>
<TE>   Look out, Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Beland</TE>
<TE>   Mar Vista</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some nice final thoughts to the Dodgers' season:</TE>
<TE>   Nice that the Dodgers have drawn 3 million fans again.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of Bob Daly and Fox to fail to get those fans another hitter
before the trading deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of Shawn Green to fail to hit one home run in the crucial
final two weeks of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Nice that the Dodgers don't have even one hitter batting .290, let
alone .300.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of Dan Evans to trade away the Dodgers' top pitching prospect
for saboteur Paul Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of Adrian Beltre to provide the team with one good month.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of perennial patient Kevin Brown to defer some of his salary
to help the team. Oh, wait. He didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of Eric Karros to decide to stop hitting for power.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of Mark Grudzielanek to pout for the first two-thirds of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Nice of Jim Tracy to fall so in love with Giovanni Carrara, it
cost the team at least five wins.</TE>
<TE>   Nice that Tracy is such a brilliant strategist. (I'm kidding. He's
not.)</TE>
<TE>   Nice that Dave Roberts is the only guy on the team who can lay
down a bunt.</TE>
<TE>   Nice to hear the Dodgers had such a good time out on the town in
Denver, while losing three out of four and saying goodbye to their
playoff hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Nice that everyone in the clubhouse likes each other so much.</TE>
<TE>   Nice that another third-place season is just fine with Dodger
management.</TE>
<TE>   Nice. Real nice.</TE>
<TE>   Sneaky Sims</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It infuriates me that Bob Daly and Fox will look upon another
third-place finish as a successful one for the Dodgers. Third place
in a five-team division, whether you have 90 wins or 75 wins, is
still third place. Yet, the team still draws well, so Fox doesn't
care. Next year, they'll use all their supposed resources and strive
to--maybe, if things all fall into place, if everything goes well,
barring injuries, mind you, no guarantees--compete once again for
third place in the West.</TE>
<TE>   I remember the days when the Dodgers either won their division
title or it was a bad season. I miss those days.</TE>

<LD>How much longer can the Mighty Ducks expect their last few
season-ticket holders to hang on? They are offering free admission to
Sunday's exhibition to anyone with a ticket stub from the earlier
Angel game the same day. Not only does this speak to the sparse
number of tickets sold, but is the ultimate insult to those who must
pay full regular-season prices for tickets to these meaningless games
in order to purchase season tickets.</LD>
<LD>   I for one am glad I got off the season-ticket train, and hope the
last few season-seat holders will turn out the lights on the way out.</LD>

<LD>Although the final score was 27-20, the real difference between
Kansas State and USC is far greater. Kansas State is a team. USC, as
usual, is a bunch of athletes who want to look good for the scouts.
Nowhere was this more evident than in the second half when Kareem
Kelly, with his team trailing by 21 points, was seen mugging for the
camera and kidding around with defensive back Terence Newman, the
same Newman who had humiliated and dominated Kelly for the entire
game.</LD>
<LD>   Note to Pete Carroll: I hope you looked across the field and saw
how a real head coach in the NCAA operates. Would Bill Snyder have
tolerated one of his players mugging and kidding around with an
opposing player while his team was 21 points down?</LD>
<LD>   Sadly, athletes like Kareem Kelly are no longer the exception at
USC. They are the rule.</LD>
<TE>   No desire. No passion. No heart. Same old SC.</TE>

<TE>   Halfway through watching USC's embarrassing loss to Kansas State,
all I could do was think that perhaps Norm Chow was using Paul
Hackett's playbook. As I live in New York, I did the police scanner
thing to see if, in fact, Paul's playbook had been reported stolen.
While I heard nothing, I received concrete evidence on Sunday after
the Jets' loss to the Patriots that Norm Chow was in fact innocent
and Paul certainly still had his playbook.</TE>
<TE>   So this begs the question, what was Chow thinking about in that
game plan? I was in a bar with about 75 other Trojans and everyone
was asking the same thing. This team has too much talent to repeat
the folly of past years.</TE>

<TE>   More than 1--pay 1.5 to 1</TE>

<TE>   Based on Colorado's games with USC and UCLA, the Trojans should be
51-point favorites against the Bruins. Anyone interested in a
bargain? I will take the Bruins and 40 points.</TE>

<TE>   Tom Lasorda has received much derision on these pages, but it's
Bob Toledo who is killing us these days. We will continue to suffer
defeats like last week's if Toledo doesn't wise up. Use your stars,
Coach! Stop sitting Manuel White with all of his speed, size and
skill.</TE>
<TE>   When will L.A. have a coach who knows what he's doing? Oh yeah,
see you in Staples.</TE>

<TE>   I have followed UCLA football for several years, loving some
moments, but in total frustration. How can a team with great
individual players end up so mediocre each year? It must be the
coach.</TE>
<TE>   A few trick plays per game do not equate to an imaginative,
resourceful coach. The team is lackadaisical and uninspired again
this year, only earlier in the season. They have never been prepared
for strong, tough opponents. We all know where nice guys finish. The
team is crying out for a strong, tough coach.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, USC and UCLA lost their first games this season, and now the
letters from angry, spoiled alumni will pour in demanding that Pete
Carroll and Bob Toledo should be fired.</TE>
<TE>   If Oklahoma, Texas, Florida State, etc., played quality schedules
like the Trojans and Bruins, they would lose too. Let's see where all
the teams are, come December.</TE>

<LD>Dear Sportswriters:</LD>

sportswriter and crudely but clearly explained why he did not like
New York or New Yorkers. I have heard many people say much the same
thing.</LD>
<LD>   John Rocker did not break any laws or try to physically injure
anyone that I know of. This creep Randy Moss broke the law,
interfered with the duty of a traffic officer, and apparently
committed assault on a traffic officer with his vehicle.</LD>

"respected" NFL player. Yuk.</TE>

<LD>It's hard to believe that the Donna McArthur-trained Lonely Moon Sign
will go off as a longshot in the $345,500 Pacific Coast Quarter Horse
Racing Assn.'s Breeders Futurity, but that's how good the field is
for tonight's ninth race.</LD>
<LD>   McArthur says the bay colt, who finished second in the May 18 Los
Alamitos Kindergarten Futurity, has recovered from sore knees and
shins and proved it by winning his Sept. 18 trial to tonight's
futurity.</LD>
<LD>   But against other top horses such as Special Queen Sa and
Azyoucansee, it won't be an easy 350-yard run.</LD>
<TE>   Special Queen Sa posted the best time in qualifying for the
futurity. The filly has finished in the money in five of her six
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Azyoucansee finished second in the June 22 Governor's Cup
Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   Also considered contenders are Dashnlitia, third in the Ed Burke,
and Just Think, running in her third futurity.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Lets Disco First, 2. Gilali, 3. Dreamer Beamer, 4.
Murmuring Sea, 5. Hi Big Dreams, 6. Mighty Advance Man, 7. Biscotti,
8. Willie Good Time, 9. Special Queen Sa, 10. Blue Grass Bounce, 11.
Takin My Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Four: Stay late and take Scuba Steve and Willie Good Time in the
eighth, Azyoucansee and Special Queen Sa in the ninth, Wcr Rubys
Diamond and veteran Blue Grass Bounce in the 10th, and Indigodash and
Takin My Lane in the 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: In a ho-hum race, Mighty Cheatum on the rail is
worth a $2 gamble in the first. In the third, Dash With Illusions
rates a look. In the seventh, Elegantely drops in class.</TE>

<DH>Basketball: Johnson's Hall of Fame induction is all the
more magical because he can accept in person.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Everyone's thrilled to be a Hall of Famer but no one is as thrilled
as Magic Johnson, whose induction, it was once feared, might have to
be posthumous.</LD>
<LD>   "The thing I'm most happy about is, I'm actually here in person,
myself, to accept the award, that I'm living," Johnson said at the
pre-induction news conference.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great day for me, that I'm here and will be accepting it
myself. I'm here to greet all of you. I'm here to give Larry [Bird,
his presenter] a hug and him give me one back. This is special. My
family is here. My parents are still living.... It's a special time
because 11 years ago, nobody knew.... "</LD>
<TE>   Since Johnson announced that he was HIV positive in 1991, an act
of courage that was all but overshadowed in a he's-no-hero backlash,
he has never admitted so dramatically his relief at surviving. But
it's 11 years later and here he is.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was inducted Friday night and it was as special as special
could be. It's not true that the Basketball Hall of Fame built him
his own wing but it did open its new $45-million hall for the event,
putting up billboards around town advertising, "The New Hall Has
Magic."</TE>
<TE>   Bird, credited with reviving the NBA with Johnson in the '80s,
presented him, returning the favor Johnson had done by attending
Bird's retirement ceremony in Boston, when Magic tore off his Laker
warmup to reveal he was wearing a Celtic jersey and Bird blurted,
"Magic, get outa my dreams!"</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to speak from my heart," Bird said Friday at the
induction ceremony. "But, man, he broke my heart so many times, do I
have anything left?"</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had originally hoped that the hall would bend its rule,
that a player must be retired for five years to be eligible, so that
he could enter with Bird, who was inducted in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   However, the hall stuck to its rules. Since Johnson had returned
to play in 1996, he would have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said that I was hoping and wishing that we would go
in together because coming in [to the NBA] together was so wonderful
for us and for the league," Johnson said. "But it didn't happen but
we're still together today....</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny how God blesses you with someone in your life, like a
Larry Bird. This is a once-in-a-lifetime situation, that we could
have each other in each other's lives and we're able to do the things
and accomplish the things that we accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, the Celtics against the Lakers. Indiana State vs.
Michigan State--I mean, even today, Indiana State-Michigan State is
the highest-watched game in NCAA history [actually, it's the
highest-rated basketball game ever]. That's 25 years later or
something."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Bird started as bitter rivals but a funny thing
happened as they went from the 1979 NCAA final to starring roles with
the Lakers and Celtics, who already hated each other and would meet
in three NBA Finals in the '80s, the Lakers winning in 1985 and '87,
the Celtics in '84.</TE>
<TE>   They became friends, after shooting a sneaker commercial together
and discovering they were different versions of the same guy.</TE>
<TE>   "He played the game like I always wanted to play the game," Bird
said. "To be able to control the ball and make plays. That's how I
always envisioned a basketball player."</TE>
<TE>   Said Johnson: "We couldn't run. We could only jump that high
[holding his fingers an inch apart]. But, you know what?
Fundamentals, knowing how to really play and playing with our heads,
that was us.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, to see him pump fake, pump fake ... and he makes you come
up. And he says, 'Magic, you know you shouldn't have come up out of
your stance.'</TE>
<TE>   "I used to hate him talking. There he is, right there and nobody
can rotate to him. So I'm running out there to [guard] him. So he's
standing over here like this--'I don't know why you're running out
here.' I used to be so mad at him."</TE>
<TE>   Their friendship was an added gift for the NBA, turning the
Laker-Celtic rivalry, which was already glamorous and bitter, into
one built on mutual respect.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic boss Red Auerbach might still have chased the referees to
their dressing room after a loss and Laker Coach Pat Riley might have
thrown out the drinking water in Boston, fearing Auerbach had
poisoned it, but for a change, graciousness entered the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Now when Johnson and Bird meet, it's as much a reminder of how
much things have changed, with the league in transition from the era
of great players to the age of their young successors.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry and I take a personal pride in everything regarding the
game today, the salaries, everything," Johnson said. "Because if we
don't do what we do, the TV contracts wouldn't be what they are and
the salaries wouldn't be what they are....</TE>
<TE>   "But when you look at us, you look at us as winners. Guys don't
understand, they want to be a star in this league but a lot of them
have never won. And to be a star in this league, and then to be a
superstar, you have to win. And all of us cared about winning. We

<LD>The Boston Celtics, after their best season in 14 years, will be sold
to a local investment group for $360 million in a surprise deal
announced Friday in Waltham, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement was signed in New York. NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ
Granik said he expects league approval of the deal in a couple of
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Gaston, owner since 1992, is selling the team to a group led
by venture capitalists Stephen Pagliuca and Wycliffe Grousbeck, as
well as Grousbeck's father, H. Irving Grousbeck, the founder of
Continental Cablevision and now a Stanford Business School professor.
Last season, the Celtics, at 49-33, reached the playoffs for the
first time in seven years. Wycliffe Grousbeck praised General Manager
Chris Wallace and Coach Jim O'Brien but didn't discuss possible
personnel moves.</LD>

<HD>Vikings Look Like a Tough Sell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I got a ticket once for flipping a U-turn in the middle of a block in
Westwood. That minor transgression cost me something like $75 and an
entire Saturday in traffic school, where I was treated to four hours
of gruesome movies showing highway pileups.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine if I had scooped the police officer up on my hood and
driven him half a block before dumping him on his face.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, if you do that to a traffic-control agent in
Minneapolis, you don't even miss a full day's work. Oh, yes, there is
a caveat: You have to be Randy Moss.</LD>
<TE>   I'm not going to sermonize on the special treatment athletes
receive, or how absurd it is that Hennepin County prosecutors
couldn't put together a felony case against Moss, even though
eyewitnesses saw him use his 2002 Lexus to nudge 27-year-old agent
Amy Elizabeth Zaccardi down the street, stopping only when she fell
but never getting out of his car.</TE>
<TE>   Is it a surprise that the Vikings have decided not to suspend Moss
for Sunday's game against the Seahawks? Of course not.</TE>
<TE>   My point is this: The 0-3 Minnesota Vikings are in as much
disarray as any organization in sports, and I just pray they never
wind up in Los Angeles. Red McCombs is trying to sell the team and
the NFL would love to have a franchise in L.A., assuming there is a
stadium that fits the bill. At first glance, it appears the Metrodome
lease will keep the team in Minnesota for years to come, but McCombs
has indicated there are ways out of it.</TE>
<TE>   Buyer beware, though. Consider the last five years:</TE>
<TE>   * 1997--Then-coach Dennis Green writes his autobiography, "No Room
For Crybabies," and drops a bombshell in the final chapter. He says
he has a "secret money mentor" who will enable Green to become his
own boss by buying out the 10-member consortium that owned the team
at the time. It made headlines and shook up some people, but in the
end Green couldn't produce the green.</TE>
<TE>   * 1998--The Vikings get off to a spectacular 15-1 start, Randall
Cunningham is playing the best football of his life, and the club's
decision makers look like geniuses for drafting Moss with the 21st
pick. The Marshall receiver's troubled background scared off a lot of
teams, yet he turns out to be the diamond of the rookie class. The
Vikings are Super Bowl bound ... until Gary Anderson, the NFL's most
reliable kicker that season, misses a 38-yard field-goal attempt
against Atlanta in the NFC championship game. His miss in the fourth
quarter is his first of the season--and Atlanta's Morten Andersen
nails a kick from the same spot to win it in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999--Minnesota uses its top pick on Daunte Culpepper, and, with
its second selection in the first round, drafts Michigan State
defensive lineman Demetrius Underwood. Culpepper is a good choice;
Underwood goes AWOL after the first day of training camp and sets off
on a two-week odyssey of self-discovery. Eventually, the team works
out a settlement with him and cuts him loose.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000--After an unexpectedly strong 11-2 start, the Vikings lose
their last three but still make the playoffs, where they open with a
divisional victory over New Orleans. They then lose the NFC
championship game to the New York Giants, 41-0, or, as Moss puts it,
"41 to doughnut." From the beginning of the 1998 season through the
playoff victory over the Saints, the Vikings are a league-best 39-14.
Since, they are 5-15.</TE>
<TE>   * 2001--Pro Bowl tackle Korey Stringer dies of heatstroke after
the second day of training camp, and months later his widow files a
$100-million wrongful-death lawsuit against the Vikings. The club has
neither tried to settle the suit, nor has it paid the remainder of
Stringer's contract to his family. Meanwhile, Moss makes headlines
for all the wrong reasons, first for his constant bickering with
fellow receiver Cris Carter--as self-centered as anyone in the
game--then for saying he only really plays when he wants to play.</TE>
<TE>   * 2002--The Vikings are winless after three games and probably
will miss the playoffs again. They haven't missed the playoffs in
consecutive seasons since 1990 and '91, the end of the Jerry Burns
era. Then again, they haven't been 0-3 since Bud Grant was a rookie
coach in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   All of this--particularly the Stringer lawsuit, which will be
heard next summer--has to make it especially difficult for McCombs to
get the asking price he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who pays top dollar for the Vikings is being taken for a
ride.</TE>
<TE>   And, as any traffic-control agent will tell you, that's not a good
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Letter Perfect</TE>
<TE>   In his just-released book, "Still Perfect: The Untold Story of the
1972 Miami Dolphins," author and South Florida Sun-Sentinel columnist
Dave Hyde gives the inside scoop on kicker Garo Yepremian and his
Super Bowl blunder, that hysterical attempt to complete a pass after
his field-goal attempt had been blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his teammates were ready to wring his neck. Others were
simply icy. Even though the Dolphins won, the excruciating memory of
that play haunted Yepremian for months. He never felt quite right
until he received a warm letter from Coach Don Shula, reminding him
of how many clutch kicks he'd made and how his efforts were crucial
to the perfect season. Immediately, Yepremian's spirits brightened,
he could joke about the kick, and wound up making a lot of money on
the speaking circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 30 years later, he was playing in a celebrity golf
tournament with Shula. A fan approached the coach and thanked him for
all he'd done.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, thank God for Coach Shula," Yepremian said. "He wrote a
letter that meant as much to me as anything a coach did."</TE>
<TE>   Letter? Shula didn't remember writing the kicker a letter.
Yepremian reminded him, but Shula insisted he'd never written that.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the two concluded the soothing words had been penned by
the coach's wife, Dorothy, who had died of breast cancer in 1991.
She'd written it, and signed her husband's name, as she often did.</TE>
<TE>   "God bless Dorothy," Yepremian said.</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST--The Rams may be missing middle linebacker London
Fletcher, but the Bills have no plans to give him back. He leads
Buffalo with 40 tackles in three games, 14 more than second-place
Antoine Winfield. Fletcher on St. Louis Coach Mike Martz: "He's
definitely probably underestimated the loss of me, not only what I
brought to that defense but also in terms of challenging guys who
were not playing up to their abilities. You can't just plug in
certain guys with that personality. It's not there. I've talked to
players on the Rams and they're telling me it's not there. So it's
not just me talking." All that talent, and he's humble too.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH--Players hate the turf in Cincinnati. Buccaneer
defensive end Simeon Rice on where it ranks in the league: "It's
worse than the worst." ... The Bengals are 0-3 for the third time in
four years and the sixth time in 12.... Not only has Baltimore scored
only seven points, the Ravens have been blanked in their last 20
possessions and have penetrated the red zone only once during that
stretch.... In preparing to play Pittsburgh on Sunday, Cleveland has
been working on the no-huddle and spread offenses. Hey, it worked for
New England and Oakland.... Either Steeler quarterback Kordell
Stewart snaps out of his funk soon, or he steps aside for Tommy
Maddox.</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH--The Texans are the youngest team in the NFL and it
shows. They lead the league in penalties with 35.... Houston has gone
eight quarters without scoring a touchdown. "The NFL is a humbling
experience," rookie quarterback David Carr told reporters in Houston.
"I haven't had this rough of a time through three games in my entire
career since fourth grade." Fourth grade must have been a
nightmare.... Didn't anybody learn from Dwayne Rudd? Atlanta
linebacker Keith Brooking was fined $5,000 by the league this week
for slamming his helmet to the turf in last Sunday's victory over the
Bengals.... Carolina Coach John Fox got a call this week from
Minnesota Coach Mike Tice, who'd refused to shake Fox's hand after
the Panthers' 21-14 victory over the Vikings last Sunday. Tice was
upset that the Panthers had tried a 39-yard field goal with eight
seconds left. "Most people don't accuse you of running it up in
seven-point games," Fox told Carolina reporters.</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST--Hottest coach in the league not named Bill Belichick?
How about Marty Schottenheimer? His 2001 Redskins won their last two,
and his 2002 Chargers are 3-0, so he's riding a five-game winning
streak.... The Broncos are 3-0 too, and they have reached the Super
Bowl five of the seven times they got off to such a rip-roaring
start.... Raider Charles Woodson, a four-time Pro Bowl cornerback, is
in line for a big raise. He's in the fifth year of a six-year,
$14-million contract he signed as a rookie.... Denver's Chester
McGlockton, a 334-pound defensive tackle, ran 24 yards to a touchdown
with a fumble recovery Sunday, prompting tight end Shannon Sharpe to
muse, "A 400-pound man has more touchdowns than I do. That's not
good."</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST--Emmitt Smith is 361 yards shy of Walter Payton's
all-time rushing mark. Best guess is, Smith will break it Week 8
against Seattle.... Safety Darren Woodson, one of the last links to
the Cowboy glory years of the early-to-mid-1990s, tore into his
teammates this week about their lack of commitment. For one thing, he
criticized them for spending so many hours playing dominoes in the
locker room. The team's No. 1 domino junkie: Smith.... Against
Seattle, Giant rookie tight end Jeremy Shockey had his first subpar
game of the season, dropping a pass and failing to adjust his route
on a blitz.... Philadelphia has scored 105 points in its first three
games, most in club history.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH--Chicago has the best linebacker in football in Brian
Urlacher, and no Bear defensive lineman has recorded a sack this
season.... Lion owner William Clay Ford addressed the players this
week and told them Coach Marty Mornhinweg, who is 2-17, is going to
be coaching them for a long time. But that's a car salesman
talking.... Chester "Swede" Johnston, the oldest former Packer and a
member of two of Curly Lambeau's championship teams, died Sept. 19 at
93. He played four positions.... If he completes 14 more passes,
Brett Favre will pass Joe Montana for fifth place on the all-time
completions list. Favre has 3,396, still miles behind leader Dan
Marino's 4,967.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH--This season's "Lethal Weapon 3:" Saint receivers Joe
Horn, Donte Stallworth and Jerome Pathon. Stallworth is a bit behind
in learning the West Coast offense, having missed part of training
camp because of a hamstring injury, but he has blistering speed....
Who says the weather doesn't matter to a dome team? The Saints are
3-0, and Tropical Storm Isidore pounded New Orleans. In 1998, the
last time the Saints were 3-0, the city was hit by Hurricane
Georges.... Tampa Bay's Derrick Brooks has intercepted passes in all
three games this season, returning picks for touchdowns against
Baltimore and St. Louis. His mom is lobbying to get the ball from the
one against the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST--St. Louis has lost 20 consecutive games when behind
heading into the fourth quarter.... The Rams are 0-3. Over the last
five years, the only team to start 0-3 and make the playoffs was the
1998 Buffalo Bills.... Surprise, surprise: Terrell Owens is making
waves in the 49er locker room again. He says the team has no killer
instinct. Who knew this guy would cause problems? Of course, he
didn't mention 17 players--eight of them starters--had flu symptoms
during Sunday's game against Washington.</TE>

<HD>$115-Million, 12-Year Contract for McNabb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donovan McNabb can spend the rest of his NFL career in a city that
has fans who originally didn't want him.</LD>
<LD>   McNabb and the Philadelphia Eagles agreed to a new 12-year
contract Friday that could be worth up to a record $115 million.</LD>
<LD>   The total potential value would be the highest in NFL history,
topping the 10-year, $103 million contract Drew Bledsoe signed with
the New England Patriots in March 2001.</LD>
<TE>   McNabb's deal runs through 2013, and includes a $20.5 million
signing bonus, said his agent, Fletcher Smith. McNabb will receive
$13.5 million of that bonus up front and the rest after next season.
Including the bonus, he'll get $30 million over the next three years,
leaving $9.5 million in base salary over that span.</TE>
<TE>   "It means a lot," McNabb said. "You see great players, Hall of
Fame players that didn't stay with their team. To know that I'll be
pretty much locked in to the Philly area is a wonderful feeling for
me, my family, where I can continue to get better and better and know
that I'll be wearing the wonderful green."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb didn't get a positive welcome to Philadelphia when the
Eagles selected him with the No. 2 overall pick in the 1999 draft. He
was booed loudly by a group of Eagles fans who wanted the team to
select running back Ricky Williams.</TE>
<TE>   But McNabb quickly won them over with his strong arm and
exceptional scrambling ability.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles can void the new contract at any time. McNabb can opt
out of the final three seasons by reaching certain performance
incentives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Fame center Mike Webster was remembered at his funeral
service in Pittsburgh as a loving man who treated his friends,
teammates and total strangers as if they were family members.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Terry Bradshaw and several other former Steelers,
including Lynn Swann, Franco Harris, and former coach Chuck Noll were
among more than 200 people at the 80-minute service, nearly half of
whom stood in the modest funeral home where Webster was to be
cremated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver Bronco quarterback Brian Griese returned to practice Friday
after being injured when he tripped over his dog two days earlier.
Griese didn't practice on Thursday, but split time with backup Steve
Beuerlein, working with the first team in practice Friday. Griese is
listed as probable for Denver's game Monday against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked pretty good," Coach Mike Shanahan said. "It didn't look
like there was much soreness there, so hopefully there'll be no
setback tomorrow and he'll be ready to go." Shanahan said Griese will
likely split time with Beuerlein in practice today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Carolina Panthers released kicker Jon Hilbert and signed
Shayne Graham to a one-year contract to replace him. Hilbert, who
signed after John Kasay underwent hernia surgery a week ago and went
on injured reserve, missed kicks of 39 and 45 yards in Sunday's 21-14
win against Minnesota.... Tampa Bay guard Kerry Jenkins practiced
Friday despite a cracked bone in his left leg and was upgraded from
doubtful to probable for Sunday's game at Cincinnati.</TE>

<LD>SAM FARMER'S NFL RANKINGS AND COMMENTS:</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (record)        Comment (last week's rank)
1     NEW ENGLAND  (3-0)   Kansas City scare should resonate with
                           Patriots. (1)
2     DENVER  (3-0)        Broncos are 3-0 for the first time since
                           1998. (2)
3     OAKLAND  (2-0)       Tennessee has always given the Raiders
                           problems. (3)
4     PHILADELPHIA  (2-1)  Eagles averaging nearly 35 points a game.
                           (4)
5     NEW ORLEANS  (3-0)   Showed character in comeback against
                           Bears. (5)
6     SAN FRANCISCO (2-1)  Terrell Owens has most big-play potential
                           in the game. (6)
7     MIAMI  (3-0)         Offense is still prone to sputtering at
                           times. (10)
8     GREEN BAY  (2-1)     Packers shouldn't have let Lions keep
                           things close. (7)
9     TAMPA BAY  (2-1)     Gruden or no Gruden, defense is well ahead
                           of the offense. (12)
10    N.Y. GIANTS  (2-1)   Light on offense and generally
                           unimpressive against Seattle. (8)
11    SAN DIEGO (3-0)      Chargers get first big test Sunday when
                           Patriots come to town. (13)
12    CHICAGO  (2-1)       Blowing a big lead can really bruise the
                           psyche. (9)
13    ST. LOUIS  (0-3)     Where is Isaac Bruce? He disappears for
                           long stretches. (11)
14    PITTSBURGH  (0-2)    Steelers need to do something to patch
                           holes in pass defense. (14)
15    BUFFALO  (1-2)       Despite the loss, Drew Bledsoe looked
                           great against Denver. (15)
16    CLEVELAND  (2-1)     Tim Couch is holding onto his job ... for
                           the moment. (17)
17    INDIANAPOLIS  (2-1)  Peyton Manning looked good against Texans.
                           But who doesn't? (19)
18    TENNESSEE  (1-2)     Most erratic team in the league. (16)
19    ATLANTA (1-2)        Michael Vick does just about everything
                           well, yet that's not enough. (22)
20    N.Y. JETS (1-2)      Vinny Testaverde is looking his age. (18)
21    JACKSONVILLE  (1-1)  Jaguars catch a break by playing host to
                           sagging Jets. (20)
22    CAROLINA  (3-0)      Yes, they're undefeated. But they have the
                           league's softest start. (24)
23    KANSAS CITY  (1-2)   Now that they nearly stunned Patriots,
                           Chiefs could shock Dolphins. (23)
24    MINNESOTA (0-3)      Fighting between Culpepper and Moss has to
                           worry Vikings. (21)
25    ARIZONA  (1-2)       Jake Plummer is back to his gambling ways.
                           (25)
26    SEATTLE  (0-3)       Defense looked a lot better last week. (27)
27    WASHINGTON  (1-2)    Spurrier has the scheme but lacks the
                           players. (26)
28    DETROIT (0-3)        High-flying New Orleans could be in for a
                           surprise this week. (32)
29    HOUSTON (1-2)        David Carr is taking a beating. (29)
30    BALTIMORE  (0-2)     Broncos at Ravens on Monday night? Please
                           pass the remote. (30)
31    DALLAS  (1-2)        Philly pounding was humiliating to an
                           already humbled team. (28)
32    CINCINNATI  (0-3)    Is it possible to rank the Bengals even
                           lower? (31)</TE>

<KH>DUCK/KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Smirnov Appears Ready to Emerge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster; Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexei Smirnov wasn't ready last season. He knew it.</LD>
<LD>   Smirnov, the Ducks' top draft pick in 2000, came from Russia to
participate in Mighty Ducks' training camp a year ago. He mixed it up
a little, then he went home.</LD>
<LD>   Now Smirnov seems on the verge of taking up permanent residency in
Anaheim. He continued his impressive performance in this year's camp
with a goal in the Ducks' 5-2 exhibition victory over San Jose on
Friday at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year, I knew I still had to get better," Smirnov said. "But
I grew up. I feel I'm ready this year."</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov was awarded a penalty shot after being taken down on a
breakaway by the Sharks' Scott Hannan in the second period Friday.
Smirnov then slipped a shot between the legs of goalie Vesa Toskala.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year helped me because I knew what to expect," Smirnov said.
"I was able to prepare myself. I can play in the NHL."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks hope so. Smirnov's size (6 feet 3, 211 pounds) and his
willingness to battle in front of the net are things they have
lacked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to talk about what a guy will be like five years from
now, but what I see is a big man with great skills who seems to
understand the game," Coach Mike Babcock said. "We want to find out
now if he can play in the NHL and contribute."</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov is one of five young players who will get a long look the
next few games. Center Jason Krog, who had two assists, right wing
Jonathan Hedstrom, who had one assist, left wing Stanislav Chistov,
who had a goal, and defenseman Kurt Sauer were also in the lineup
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fredrik Olausson, who missed the first three exhibition games with
a sore groin, scored a second-period goal.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yanick Lehoux, one of the Kings' four highly touted forward
prospects, didn't make the second cut of training camp Friday, the
Kings sending him and six other players to their American Hockey
League team at Manchester, N.H.</TE>
<TE>   The move was not a surprise. Lehoux, who scored 125 points in 66
games last season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, is the
most lightly regarded of a group of 20-year-old King prospects that
includes Michael Cammalleri, Alexander Frolov and Jared Aulin, all of
whom remain in camp.</TE>
<TE>   Lehoux's greatest shortcoming: lack of commitment on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He made steps [to correct that] this fall," Coach Andy Murray
said. "We had a long talk with him after our summer camp [in July]
about the areas he needed to work on and he addressed those."</TE>
<TE>   Among the others sent down was Pavel Rosa, who played the last two
seasons in Finland before returning this fall to give the NHL another
shot.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wanted to tell us that he was going to play in the
NHL," Murray said after breaking the news to the 25-year-old Czech
winger. "He said it in a polite way and with conviction, and that's
what we wanted to hear."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other than former MVP Joe Sakic of the Colorado Avalanche, Murray
said, Frolov was "the best player on the ice" in Wednesday night's
3-2 exhibition loss at Denver. "He was tremendous," the coach said of
the Russian right wing, who had a goal and an assist.</TE>

<KH>NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Giants Win and Close In on Wild Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Schmidt pitched 7 1/3 innings of four-hit ball as the San
Francisco Giants moved to the brink of their second playoff berth in
three seasons with a 2-1 victory over the Houston Astros on Friday
night at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants (93-66) need one more victory or one loss by the
Dodgers to clinch the wild card--and the National League West title
still isn't mathematically out of reach. San Francisco trails
first-place Arizona by 2 1/2 games.</LD>
<LD>   Benito Santiago and Kenny Lofton each drove in a run as the Giants
ended Wade Miller's 12-game winning streak, which matched the Angels'
Jarrod Washburn for the longest in the majors this season.</LD>
<TE>   Schmidt (13-8) finished his regular season strong, retiring 11
straight batters at one point. He struck out eight and gave up only
two hits until the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Miller (15-4) hadn't lost in 16 starts since June 26, but he gave
up nine hits, walked four and struck out five.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Aurilia walked in the first and later scored on Santiago's
single. In the sixth, David Bell tripled and scored on Lofton's hit.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt lost his shutout bid on Geoff Blum's one-out homer into
the short right-field corner in the eighth, and pinch-hitter Gregg
Zaun followed with a double. Tim Worrell escaped the jam with two
quick outs, and Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 42nd save in 50
chances.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 8, Colorado 6--Miguel Batista won for the first time in
more than a month, Junior Spivey homered and the Diamondbacks won at
Phoenix to reduce their magic number for clinching the NL West to
one. Arizona clinched a tie for first, but the Giants hold the
tiebreaker because they won the season series.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondback bullpen wasted almost all of a 7-0 lead before
Byung-Hyun Kim pitched a perfect ninth for his 35th save in 41 tries.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 2, St. Louis 1--Ben Sheets wrapped up a late-season
surge with seven sharp innings, and the Brewers won at St. Louis. It
was only St. Louis' fourth loss in 23 games, ending a five-game
winning streak. Milwaukee's Jose Hernandez, one strikeout from tying
Bobby Bonds' major league record of 189 in 1970, did not play for the
second consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Eric Young doubled off Rick White (5-7) to start the
eighth and advanced on a sacrifice. With the infield playing in,
third baseman Scott Rolen tried to make a barehanded play on Ronnie
Belliard's high chopper and threw wildly and just a bit late to the
plate as the go-ahead run scored.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, who signed a $90 million, eight-year contract extension
earlier in the day, was charged with an error.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3-7, New York 1-4--Brave reliever John Smoltz set the NL
record with his 54th save, finishing a victory over the Mets that
started Atlanta to a doubleheader sweep at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones and Darren Bragg hit two-run homers, and Javy Lopez
added a three-run shot that led Atlanta to a victory in the second
game, one that gave the Braves 100 wins for the fourth time in six
years.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Cox became the first manager with five 100-win seasons in
the NL.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 13, Chicago 3--Brian Giles had the kind of game Sammy
Sosa needed, hitting two homers and driving in a career-high six runs
as the Pirates won at Chicago. Sosa was hitless for the third time in
four games, and remains stuck on 498 career homers with only two
games left in the season. He hasn't homered since Sept. 20. Giles hit
a three-run homer in the fourth and a two-run shot in the ninth. His
five runs scored were the most by a Pirate since Bobby Bonilla did it
against Atlanta on May 20, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 5, Philadelphia 2--A.J. Burnett struck out eight and Mike
Lowell and Brian Banks homered for the Marlins at Miami. Burnett gave
up two runs--one earned--and four hits in 5 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Florida outfielder Tim Raines will officially announce his
retirement today. Raines, 43, played the final season of his 23-year
major league career with Florida, where he was used mainly as a
reserve and pinch hitter. Raines has 2,604 hits, 808 stolen bases and
1,565 runs scored in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Cincinnati 3--Cincinnati catcher Kelly Stinnett's
throwing error with two out in the 11th allowed the winning run to
score as the Expos won at Montreal. The Expos won their 81st game to
avoid a losing season for the first time since 1996.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Gets Out of Woods' 0-for-2 Effort</HD>
<DH>Golf: Mickelson and Cink help Americans rally within a
point after fast start by Europeans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods lost both times he played, the U.S. dropped three of the
first four matches on opening day, Sergio Garcia won twice and you
figure, what, the Ryder Cup is just some swanky European vacation?</LD>
<LD>   Anything to declare?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, a blowout.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, it was beginning to look that way Friday at the Belfry,
but the United States got some help from some unexpected places (uh,
a Stewart Cink-Jim Furyk team?), wrung out a crucial half-point from
Phil Mickelson and David Toms after they were three down through 14,
and by nightfall trailed by a little instead of a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Europe still leads the U.S., 4 1/2--3 1/2, but it probably should
have been a lot more than that. And it sure seemed to be heading that
direction after Woods and Mark Calcavecchia got dropped by a 2-and-1
punch from Garcia-Lee Westwood in the alternate-shot format.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I hit the ball well," Woods said. "I can't remember the
last time we were up after the first day."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Tiger's day was a total washout. He also lost
his morning better-ball match with Paul Azinger when the U.S. fell
behind, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone thought this was going to be easy, they were proven
wrong," U.S. captain Curtis Strange said.</TE>
<TE>   Strange used everyone he had, just as he said he would, and it was
a wise decision. Hal Sutton might be in a slump, but he teamed with
Scott Verplank to score a 2-and-1 decision over Darren Clarke and
Thomas Bjorn in the first alternate-shot match of the afternoon
session.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who won both his matches paired with Lee Westwood, pulled
away from Woods-Calcavecchia beginning at the 11th hole. Tiger and
Calcavecchia had three bogeys in a four-hole stretch, and Woods also
missed a two-foot putt for par at the 12th.</TE>
<TE>   There were other ailments as well, such as going without a birdie
from the fifth to the 17th.</TE>
<TE>   "He did play well this morning, but he let it get away this
afternoon a bit," Strange said of Woods. "That hurts. You cannot slip
at all in these matches. He doesn't feel good right now, and that's
good. That makes you come back hungrier."</TE>
<TE>   The way it was collapsing, Strange was going to have trouble
drawing a smiley face on this thing.</TE>
<TE>   But Cink, who had never played in the Ryder Cup, and Furyk, who
had never won a Ryder Cup match with a partner, gave the U.S. some
momentum with a relatively easy 3-and-2 victory over Padraig
Harrington-Paul McGinley.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson and Toms were sinking fast in their match against Colin
Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer. Mickelson sank a three-footer to
birdie the 15th, Mickelson holed another putt from the fringe to
birdie the 16th and after Langer drove into a bunker at the 17th,
Montgomerie conceded a birdie putt to Mickelson to square the match.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson drove into the rough on No. 18 and Toms managed to get
the ball on the front of the green, about 120 feet from the pin.
Langer missed the green with his second shot. Mickelson decided to
play a chip shot instead of putting and sent the ball about 12 feet
past the hole. Montgomerie nearly holed his chip shot, but the ball
rolled 10 feet past.</TE>
<TE>   Toms missed the putt for par, but so did Langer and the hole was
halved with bogeys.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have liked to win that point, I think we really deserved
it, but we're still in the lead," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Strange: "The half-point was huge for our psyche. If we do
well Sunday afternoon, we might look back at that match and say that
might have been the one that turned it around."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday looks a long way off right now. In today's better-ball
matches, Mickelson and Toms play Pierre Fulke and Phillip Price, Cink
and Furyk play Garcia and Westwood, Verplank and Scott Hoch play
Montgomerie and Langer and Woods teams with Davis Love III against
Clarke and Bjorn.</TE>
<TE>   The better-ball matches Friday morning proved one thing: Never
count out a team with a guy named Niclas. Of course, in this case,
it's Niclas Fasth, the 30-year-old Ryder Cup rookie from Sweden, but
never mind. By lunchtime, the U.S. had another case of indigestion
and Europe had a 3-1 advantage in the early going.</TE>
<TE>   Getting off to a slow start isn't exactly a new approach for the
U.S., which seems to begin every Ryder Cup in full-throttle reverse.</TE>
<TE>   If it weren't for a 1-up victory produced by Mickelson-Toms over
Harrington-Fasth, the U.S. would have come up empty. That hasn't
happened in the first-day better-ball format since 1989, but it
always seems to give the U.S. trouble.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the U.S. has won the better-ball format on opening day
only once since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   With a 3-up lead through 12 holes, Mickelson-Toms looked like a
sure thing, but it nearly turned out differently. Harrington's putt
that spun out of the hole at the 18th would have halved the match and
taken away the only U.S. victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little disappointing start," Love said.</TE>
<TE>   Love was correct in his assessment, but he could have been talking
about the match he played with David Duval against Westwood-Garcia.
Love didn't make a single birdie and Westwood-Garcia won easily,
4-and-3.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Duval nor Love made a birdie after the seventh hole.</TE>
<TE>   Woods and Azinger had no trouble making birdies and shot a
better-ball score of 63, only to lose, 1 up, to Clarke-Bjorn, who
shot a 62.</TE>
<TE>   Said Clarke: "We were making birdies all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   Azinger said that with the score he and Woods shot, they'd win "95
of 100 matches," but this wasn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "You just shrug your shoulders and say we did great, but they did
better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The team of Montgomerie and Langer was eight under in 15 holes in
their 4-and-3 demolition of Scott Hoch and Furyk in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Duval said the Ryder Cup is all about putting, and teammate Love
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's match play," Love said. "If they said we're going to play
across the street at the public course that doesn't have any rough or
sand traps, it would still be whoever makes the most putts."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>In their better-ball match Friday morning, David Duval and Davis Love
III used their drivers a total of four times between them.</LD>
<LD>   Blame the Belfry, said Paul Azinger.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a home-course advantage and they clearly took advantage of
it," Azinger said. "I think the golf course has definitely
neutralized the strength of the American team. We have a more
powerful team, big hitters like Tiger [Woods] and Phil Mickelson and
Davis and David. They've got to pull back the reins.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not saying you've got a short team on the European side, but
certainly not as long. And I think if it was driver on driver, we
might have a little bit of an edge, but the driver has been taken out
of our hands for the most part."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of length as a factor, the course has been set up with
narrow fairways and spongy rough. Duval said the setup reminded him
of Carnoustie, the site of the 1999 British Open.</TE>
<TE>   Love said he understands the decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious, [they] didn't want it to become a long drive
contest, or who can hit it the farthest in the fairway contest," he
said. "I don't understand that because they've got a lot of long
hitters on their team ... but it's narrow out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woods is 3-8-1 in the Ryder Cup. U.S. captain Curtis Strange was
even asked afterward if it was a cinch that Woods would play five
times.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it's not engraved in stone he's going to play all five
matches," said Strange, who backtracked immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a player on your team that is the caliber of Tiger
Woods ... whatever the record, I'm not sitting him down. You go with
your horses. If you get beat, you get beat. But you go with your
horses, and that's what I intend to do."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for Woods to get upset. It happened on the
first hole in the morning better-ball match, after his tee shot
landed in a bunker. He hit his next shot out but complained
immediately that a camera had clicked in his downswing.</TE>
<TE>   "I never asked [Tiger] about it," said Azinger, who was playing
with Woods. "I didn't want him to dwell on it beyond that instant."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If things had gone any better for Sam Torrance during the morning
round, he might have exploded with joy.</TE>
<TE>   In a span of about four minutes, Europe's captain said
"fantastic," "wonderful," "brilliant," "magic," "great," "brilliant"
(again), "sensational," "great" (again), "incredible," "fantastic"
(again), and "electric."</TE>
<TE>   The comeback by the U.S. team in the afternoon's best-ball matches
failed to dampen Torrance's enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Said Torrance: "If we get the last two days rained out, we've
won."</TE>
<TE>   And this: "The crowds were just amazing. I didn't see one drunk
yet. Yet. But I might be one of them after today."</TE>

<HD>UCLA Lays It on (Offensive) Line</HD>
<DH>College football: Broken rib will sideline Saffer, so
Bruins will need to show depth up front to control tempo against San
Diego State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Whip the butter. Careful with the syrup. Eleven a.m. on a weekend is
a great time for pancakes.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA offensive linemen have been getting their fill, averaging
about 40 on Saturdays the last three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Even a loss to Colorado last week didn't spoil their appetites.
The Bruins were held to 52 rushing yards and 17 points, but the line
recorded 39 pancakes--football-speak for knocking a defender off his
feet.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA (2-1) visits San Diego State at 11 a.m. The pregame meal is
at 7, but the linemen will be ravenous by kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   There will be one empty seat at the table, however. The Bruins
learned Friday that senior tackle Mike Saffer won't play because of a
broken rib.</TE>
<TE>   Saffer, recognized as the team's best lineman, reportedly injured
the rib against Colorado, but kept quiet about it and practiced all
week. The pain became too great Friday and he informed trainers of
the injury, which could sideline him from two to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing Saffer might take some juggling. Steve Vieira is listed
behind him on the depth chart, but Vieira starts at guard. If Vieira
moves to tackle, Shane Lehmann could start at guard.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lehmann has been in Coach Bob Toledo's doghouse of late,
so it is possible that Paul Mociler or Robert Cleary could step in at
guard. Another option is to leave Vieira at guard and have one of two
freshmen--Alex Potasi or Ed Blanton play tackle.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how the lineup is shuffled, losing Saffer is a big
blow. The other starters--tackle Bryce Bohlander, guard Eyoseph
Efseaff and center Mike McCloskey--must make up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   A strong performance from the line is crucial because the Bruins
hope to chew up time with sustained drives to keep the potent Aztec
offense off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind getting into a shootout, I like high-scoring games,"
Toledo said. "But if we control the ball and give our defense a
breather, that can only work in our favor. San Diego State really has
some weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Under first-year Coach Tom Craft, the Aztecs (0-4) have done
everything except win.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Adam Hall pilots Air Craft and has successive 500-yard
passing efforts. Wide receivers J.R. Tolver and Kassim Osgood rank
first and third in the nation in catches and receiving yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to bring back the element of the pass," Craft said.
"I've been surprised at how well we've moved the ball because there
are eight new starters on offense.</TE>
<TE>   "But every week, something has kept us from winning."</TE>
<TE>   A semblance of defense, mostly. But a shaky kicking game and
questionable poise are also concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs lost to Fresno State when a short field goal was
blocked on the last play of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Their special teams broke down in a loss to Colorado in which the
Aztecs had 401 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   They blew a three-touchdown second-quarter lead in a loss to
Arizona State and a two-touchdown second-quarter lead in a loss to
Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really outmanned in three of the four games," Craft said.
"Now we play UCLA, by far the most talented team we've seen.</TE>
<TE>   "Their size up front is impressive. We will have quite a hard time
against them."</TE>
<TE>   If not, Toledo will have quite a hard time coming up with an
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   His teams have a habit of crumbling after their first loss and he
spent this week pretending the 31-17 loss to Colorado never happened,
slapping a smiley face on his team's performance and moving on.</TE>
<TE>   "Our primary goal this season is to put the last game behind us
and focus on the upcoming game," he said. "And that's what we are
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that Colorado scored on five consecutive possession
beginning late in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Or that the Buffaloes rushed for 325 yards a week after USC held
them to 37.</TE>
<TE>   Or that UCLA managed only 62 rushing yards in 28 carries and got
into the red zone only twice.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to remain positive," Toledo said. "We are still a
young team. We are growing up and getting better. I like this team.
We will win more games."</TE>
<TE>   Fortuitous for the Bruins is a quirk in the calendar that allows
for a 12-game season. Instead of beginning the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule today, UCLA is able to play a fourth nonconference game for
the first time in school history.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely looking at it like a plus," quarterback Cory Paus
said. "We have one more opportunity to go out and play before
conference. I'm glad to be able to play one more game, win or lose,
so we are hitting on all cylinders going into Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   If the offensive line is hitting on every play--knocking down
linebackers on running plays and protecting Paus on passes--the
Bruins should be able to keep pace with San Diego State on the
scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs have given up more points each week, from 16 to 34 to
39 to 48, but their defense poses problems for Bruin
blockers--especially without Saffer. The linebackers blitz frequently
and ends Amon Arnold and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila are quick and rangy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the experience to make adjustments," Vieira said.
"Every week is a different challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Saffer, Bohlander and Efseaff are also returning starters
from a line that ushered tailback DeShaun Foster into Heisman Trophy
consideration last season. Vieira is the most improved lineman and
McCloskey, a redshirt freshman, has developed rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   "This has the potential to be the best line I've had here," said
line coach Mark Weber, in his sixth season at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The line has gained so much respect it is actually getting
publicity. Saffer is featured on the media guide cover and on
billboards around Los Angeles. Posters of Vieira and Bohlander are
pinned on walls around campus.</TE>
<TE>   However, there seems little danger of the linemen getting
complacent today. Not while trying to make up for the loss of Saffer.</TE>

<LD>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</LD>
<TE>   Bruin fans have expressed dismay over Coach Bob Toledo's
conservative first-half play calling, but establishing the running
game is the prudent course this week. UCLA will play ball control,
hoping to limit San Diego State's possessions. Tailbacks Akil Harris
and Manuel White could have big games. Also look for tight end Mike
Seidman to be a deep target. Getting into the red zone will be
important--the Bruins moved inside the 20-yard line only twice
against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN SAN DIEGO STATE HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs are 12th in the nation in total offense and second in
passing. Quarterback Adam Hall has thrown for 1,621 yards and nine
touchdowns. UCLA will play more nickel and dime packages than at any
time in the two-year tenure of defensive coordinator Phil Snow. The
revamped secondary must tackle well. Matt Ware will move from free
safety to cornerback opposite Ricky Manning. Ben Emanuel will play
free safety and freshman Jarrad Page and sophomore Jibri Raymo will
share strong safety duties. Cornerbacks Joe Hunter and Matt Clark
will replace linebackers in the nickel and dime alignments. UCLA
opponents have converted 38.6% of their third downs, ninth in the
Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Slowing the potent San Diego State passing attack by not
letting receivers J.R. Tolver and Kassim Osgood break runs after the
catch.</TE>
<TE>   2. Sticking to the game plan and generating a balanced attack
rather than getting into an aerial duel with the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   3. Winning the turnover battle. The Bruins forced seven turnovers
in their two victories and none in the loss to Colorado. San Diego
State has a turnover ratio of minus-5.</TE>

<HD>A Homecoming for Four Bruins</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rolling south on Interstate 5 en route to San Diego State on Friday,
the UCLA bus passed through north San Diego County, bringing back
pleasant memories for four Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   Linebacker Brandon Chillar and guard Steve Vieira starred at
Carlsbad High, graduating in 1999. Defensive end Rusty Williams is
from Vista High, which won CIF San Diego Section titles in 1996, '97
and '98. Linebacker Tim Warfield played at both schools.</LD>
<LD>   As the closest UC school to San Diego that fields a Division I
football team, UCLA has recruited well in San Diego County.
First-year San Diego State Coach Tom Craft, alarmed at the scarcity
of freshman and sophomore talent in his program, wants that to
change.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have depth, we need strong recruiting classes the next
couple of years to use as building blocks," Craft said.</TE>
<TE>   Chillar, in his second season as a Bruin starter, has advice for
Craft: Sell the location.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love San Diego," Chillar said. "It's the most beautiful
place in the country."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin junior considered attending San Diego State until UCLA
and Notre Dame began recruiting him. He has flourished in a UCLA
uniform, but ...</TE>
<TE>   "If I knew then what I know now about L.A., it might have been a
different story," he said. "It might have been a more difficult
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and Warfield were recruited by San Diego State only until
UCLA got into the picture. The Aztecs did not contact Vieira.</TE>
<TE>   The four Bruins with San Diego ties all played high school
championship games at Qualcomm Stadium. Their teams did not face one
another, but Vista won and Carlsbad lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to going back and winning there," Vieira
said. "It's something I've wanted to do since high school."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cory Paus and Troy Aikman aren't usually mentioned in the same
breath. But their UCLA statistics are similar.</TE>
<TE>   Paus, a senior, has completed 355 of 682 passes for 5,649 yards
and 35 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Aikman, the Bruin quarterback in 1987 and '88, completed 406 of
627 for 5,298 yards and 41 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The injury-prone Paus has started 28 games.</TE>
<TE>   Aikman, who went on to an illustrious career with the Dallas
Cowboys, started 24 in two UCLA seasons, both of which ended in bowl
victories and 10-2 records.</TE>

<HD>No One Can Afford to Blow Their Cover</HD>
<DH>College football: Secondaries expected to play crucial role
in Pac-10 opener at the Coliseum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First things first: This is about secondaries.</LD>
<LD>   USC's is untested, Oregon State's unforgiving.</LD>
<LD>   So when No. 18 USC plays the 23rd-ranked Beavers in a Pacific 10
Conference opener today at the Coliseum, defensive backfields move to
the forefront.</LD>
<TE>   USC went 2-1 during its nonconference schedule with nary a
deep-ball challenge in victories over Auburn and Colorado and last
week's loss at Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Oregon State rolled to victories against four
overmatched opponents with a passing game that produced a dozen plays
covering more than 30 yards, five of them for touchdowns of 40 yards
or more.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore quarterback Derek Anderson has passed for 300 yards a
game and 15 touchdowns, the longest an 80-yard hookup with slotback
Kenny Farley in a season-opening rout over Eastern Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson will throw against a Trojan secondary that includes
redshirt freshman William Buchanon, who is making his first start at
left cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got some tall receivers, some athletic receivers and also
some speed," USC safety DeShaun Hill said. "There's no doubt, they're
going to spread it out and try to go deep."</TE>
<TE>   USC's offense prefers the shorter route. Quarterback Carson
Palmer's longest completion covered 37 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-year senior will operate against a Beaver defense that
leads the nation with 11 interceptions. Cornerbacks Terrell Roberts
and Dennis Weathersby and safeties Lawrence Turner and Mitch Meeuwsen
helped Oregon State pick off four passes against Eastern Kentucky,
three against Temple, one against Nevada Las Vegas and three in last
week's 59-19 pasting of Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   "They are supposed to be a lot like the Oregon State defense two
years ago," USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly said. "If that's true,
it's going to be a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Oregon State defeated the Trojans at Corvallis, 31-21,
the Beavers' only win over USC in 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Trojans won in overtime, 16-13, keeping Oregon
State winless at the Coliseum since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   In that game, freshman tailback Steven Jackson came off the bench
for Oregon State and rushed for 119 yards. He is averaging 134 yards
a game this season for an offense that is producing nearly 500.</TE>
<TE>   "They look formidable in all areas," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.
"We'll see if that's the competition or that's them. I think it's a
lot of them right now."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll hopes the Trojans can neutralize Oregon State's big-play
capability by controlling the clock with long drives.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Sultan McCullough, who has rushed for a team-best 241
yards, will start at tailback. Seniors Justin Fargas and Malaefou
MacKenzie also will play, but, Carroll said, the Trojans will abandon
the rotation they have employed if one back asserts himself.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll also hopes for a better performance from special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore transfer Ryan Killeen will handle field-goal and
extra-point attempts in place of senior David Davis, who struggled
the last two games. If Killeen falters, Davis will have a shot at
redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State kicker Ryan Cesca is looking forward to the same.
Last season against USC, Cesca missed two late field goals that might
have won the game.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer eventually scored on a four-yard run in overtime to give
the Trojans the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer does not anticipate a low-scoring game today.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they can put a lot of points on the board," he said.
"We're just going to have to score a lot more."</TE>

<LD>   TV--FSN. Radio--KMPC (1540)</LD>
<LD>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</LD>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer is completing 58% of his passes, a
figure that would be higher if not for eight drops last week against
Kansas State. He'll have his work cut out against an Oregon State
defense that leads the nation with 11 interceptions. Last week
against Fresno State, the Beavers intercepted three passes and broke
up 12 others. Senior tailbacks Sultan McCullough and Justin Fargas
will get most of the carries if the Trojans try to slow down Oregon
State's big-play capability by controlling the ball. Linebackers Nick
Barnett and Richard Siegler are the Beavers' top tacklers.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN OREGON STATE HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers are balanced. Sophomore quarterback Derek Anderson is
averaging 300 passing yards a game and has thrown for 15 touchdowns
in an offense that goes for the jugular. Flanker James Newson has 22
receptions and five touchdowns. Sophomore tailback Steven Jackson is
the nation's seventh-leading rusher, averaging 134 yards a game. With
Ronald Nunn out for the season because of a knee injury, redshirt
freshman William Buchanon will start at left cornerback for USC.
USC's front seven is sound but must tackle better than it did in last
week's loss to Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Prevent the big play. Oregon State produced 29 plays that
covered 25 yards or more in its first four games, 11 resulting in
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   2. Control the clock. The Trojans can keep the ball out of Oregon
State's hands and avoid its dangerous secondary by establishing their
rushing attack and sustaining drives.</TE>
<TE>   3. Eliminate special-teams mistakes. The kicker, whether it's Ryan
Killeen or David Davis, must convert. Punter Tom Malone cannot afford
to give Oregon State favorable field position.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Killeen, recruited by USC to boot kickoffs into the end zone,
will add field-goal and extra-point attempts to his duties today when
the Trojans play Oregon State at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   USC Coach Pete Carroll gave the nod to Killeen on Friday after a
week of competition in practice with David Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, a senior, made 15 of 18 field-goal attempts last season and
kicked a 37-yard field goal in this year's opener against Auburn,
then struggled in the last two games.</LD>
<TE>   He missed an extra-point attempt and had a field-goal and
extra-point attempt blocked against Colorado on Sept. 14. Last week
at Kansas State, Davis missed a 30-yard field-goal attempt and had an
extra-point try blocked and returned for a two-point play.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen replaced Davis at halftime and kicked two extra points in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He made eight of 11 field-goal attempts and 27 of 30 extra-point
attempts last season at Mt. San Antonio College.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been almost a month since USC last played in the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans defeated Auburn on Sept. 2 before a bye week and games
at Colorado and Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Trojans lost to Kansas State, 27-20, before a
frenzied crowd of nearly 50,000 at Manhattan, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to be home," defensive tackle Shaun Cody said.
"Hopefully, our fans will make some noise like the ones at Kansas
State."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today's game marks the 14th time the Trojans will play an
undefeated Oregon State team. USC won the first 12 before losing in
2000 at Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   It also is the fifth time No. 18 USC and No. 23 Oregon State will
play while both teams are ranked in the top 25. It happened in 1939,
1951, 1957 and 1968. The higher-ranked team won each time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State Coach Dennis Erickson has never won at the Coliseum.</TE>

<HD>Vargas Drug Test Reveals Steroids</HD>
<DH>Boxing: He is first boxer to test positive in Nevada but
denies knowledge of how substance appeared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A routine drug test administered to Fernando Vargas in Nevada the
night of his fight against Oscar De La Hoya has revealed the presence
of an anabolic steroid, an illegal substance that could result in a
suspension for the Oxnard fighter.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas is the first boxer to test positive for steroids in Nevada,
according to Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State
Athletic Commission. Vargas' manager, Rolando Arellano, said his
fighter would ask for a second test.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas, who lost the 154-pound championship fight to De La Hoya on
an 11th-round TKO at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas on Sept.
14, denied wrongdoing in a written statement.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm extremely upset about the preliminary results of my urine
test following my bout against Oscar De La Hoya," Vargas' statement
read. "However, I want everyone to understand that I would never
knowingly put harmful chemicals, such as anabolic steroids, into my
body.... I would ask that people refrain from passing judgment until
all the facts are uncovered. And I wish to make it clear that I do
intend to get to the bottom of what happened and uncover the truth."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Vargas said the fighter was pointing a finger at
his nutritionist, Mazen Ali. Ali could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I want you to know that I am shocked," Vargas wrote in a letter
to Ratner. "I had professionals in my camp and I was given many
nutritional supplements each day. I took what I was given and did not
think to question because I relied upon and trusted those around me.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that steroids were banned and that there would be testing.
The others responsible in my camp knew the same. I am upset beyond
words...."</TE>
<TE>   According to Arellano, Vargas was unsupervised during his urine
test at a Las Vegas clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone intentionally using an alleged illegal substance would
find a way to switch samples ... under those circumstances," Arellano
said.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas is expected to request a hearing before the Nevada
commission, which, according to commission officials, would be held
in 30 to 45 days.</TE>
<TE>   The only precedent commissioners can cite is the case of Josh
Barnett, who tested positive for steroids after the Ultimate Fighting
Championship earlier this year and was suspended for six months.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be asking the hard questions," said Luther Mack,
head of the Nevada Commission. "He is saying that somebody gave him
those steroids without his knowledge. That is hard to believe.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first pure boxer to test positive and it will not be
tolerated. We will not sit idly by. We have to be strict. We need to
increase the integrity of the sport. It has to be clean....</TE>
<TE>   "It's particularly unfortunate because this was a great fight,
maybe one of the best of all time."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas tested positive for stanozolol, the same steroid that cost
Canadian Ben Johnson a gold medal in the men's 100-meter event at the
1988 Seoul Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "For a boxer to use steroids, it gives him an unfair advantage
tantamount to assault and battery," said Dr. Robert Voy, the former
chief medical officer of the USOC, who is now the president of USA
Boxing, an amateur wing of the sport. "I feel sorry for Fernando
Vargas. He has embarrassed himself."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, who has sometimes had weight problems, spoke repeatedly
about his physical conditioning in the days leading up to the De La
Hoya fight. He would not allow photographs of his chest or stomach
until the weigh-in, saying that his uncharacteristically lean,
muscled frame would scare De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of steroids does produce an increase in muscle mass and
power," Voy said, adding that such effects would last only through
the first portion of a 12-round fight.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, muscle fatigue would set in faster and the fighter
would slow down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas won the first round and was even on most scorecards before
the seventh round. Then De La Hoya began to catch Vargas with his
right hand. De La Hoya shook Vargas with a left hook in the 10th
round, knocked him down with another left hook in the 11th, then
threw 16 unanswered punches against the defenseless Vargas before
referee Joe Cortez stopped the fight.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya said, "It's very unfortunate that Fernando Vargas felt
he had to resort to the use of steroids. We don't really need that in
boxing. We cannot tolerate performance-enhancing drugs. It does not
make for a level playing field.</TE>
<TE>   "But hard work, determination and heart will always beat
steroids."</TE>

<LD>After spending a night in jail this week because of an incident
involving a Minneapolis traffic officer, Randy Moss solidified his
status as the NFL's public enemy No. 1 but promised to take out his
frustrations on the football field.</LD>
<LD>   That would be good for the Vikings, who are 0-3 heading into
Sunday night's game at Seattle and desperately need Moss to play to
the level of his ego.</LD>
<LD>   With 21 catches for 185 yards and two touchdowns, Moss' numbers
are not bad, but they fall a first down short of everyone's
expectations for a player who received an $18-million signing bonus.</LD>
<TE>   It's wrong, however, to blame Moss for all of the winless Vikings'
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's offensive woes start with coordinator Scott Linehan
and Coach Mike Tice. They have built a clueless attack around Moss
that is as predictable as the weather in the Vikings' Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Tice's "Randy ratio," which calls for Moss to touch the
ball on 40% of the Vikings' plays, defenses are having an easy time
frustrating him.</TE>
<TE>   Moss is being double-teamed on nearly every play as he confronts
defenses geared to shut him down. Most opponents sit back in a
deep-cover-two defense, which features two safeties playing on the
hash marks 20 yards off the ball before the snap.</TE>
<TE>   This hampers a speedy and athletic player like Moss, who has
terrorized secondaries since joining the NFL in 1998. In averaging 17
yards a catch over his first four seasons in the league, Moss was the
league's top long-ball threat. But this season, teams have limited
him to 8.8 yards a reception.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings have tried to counter cover-two defenses by using Moss
more as a slot receiver but that hasn't been effective.</TE>
<TE>   In previous seasons, Cris Carter excelled in this role for the
Vikings, but now he's a commentator on HBO's "Inside the NFL." Moss
has struggled in the slot because of his body type and his inability
to avoid big hits in the middle of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Carter had the perfect compact build to go in motion and
run choice routes, which are short timing patterns based on open
areas in defenses, Moss is lanky with average skills when running
short routes. A confused quarterback Daunte Culpepper has often
guessed wrong when trying to anticipate Moss' moves. And in spending
so much time trying to figure out Moss' patterns, Culpepper has
missed seeing other receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "We watch films on teams and prepare for them, but then when we
play them, they play us totally different than any other team,"
Culpepper said this week in a conference call. "It's because of Randy
and how teams are always trying to stop what he can do."</TE>
<TE>   Moss is learning that success in the NFL is often short-lived
because hitting back is the way of the game. Intimidation rules and
Moss is just getting some payback.</TE>
<TE>   Because teams are getting more open hits on Moss, he has developed
the bad habit of giving up on balls when he thinks there's about to
be a big collision. That happened Sunday in the Vikings' loss to the
Carolina Panthers. On a deep pass down the left sideline, Moss quit
on the ball when he saw Mike Minter waiting to hit him, and Minter
intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   For Moss to be effective in this offense, he has to be able to
catch throws within the defensive seams. But because opposing teams
are content to keep a safety deep, often with a man underneath, this
has been a difficult pass to complete.</TE>
<TE>   That was also the case with another interception when Culpepper
tried to force a pass to Moss down the left hash marks.</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper thought Moss was going to run a streak route and try to
beat the safety to the ball. Moss, however, thought it would be
better for him to bend his route in front of the safety and the
result was another turnover.</TE>
<TE>   Also hurting Moss' production has been the Vikings' running game.
Minnesota actually has the third-best rushing attack in the NFC, but
the Vikings can't get the ground yardage when they need it most.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the Vikings' running back tandem of Michael Bennett and
Moe Williams gets so little respect. The Vikings seldom face
eight-men stacked defenses, which focus on stopping the run, and
their play-action pass plays are usually ineffective against nickel
coverage--five defensive backs.</TE>
<TE>   But don't count Moss and the Vikings out yet, fantasy league
players. The Seahawks may be just what the Vikings need to turn
things around.</TE>
<TE>   Moss has always played well on national television, and Sunday's
game will be shown on ESPN. With Seattle cornerback Shawn Springs
hobbled by a foot injury, Moss will again face zone defenses geared
to stop him.</TE>
<TE>   That should give Culpepper plenty of easy pre-snap reads to help
him decide where to throw. With tight end Byron Chamberlain back in
the lineup after missing the last two games because of injury and
Seattle's weak run defense, Culpepper should not be so pressed to get
the ball to Moss.</TE>
<TE>   Once Minnesota is able to open things up with some other weapons,
that should free up Moss for some one-on-one coverages. Advantage
Vikings.</TE>
