<HD>A Black-and-White Mess No Matter Who Wins</HD>
<DH>If the skin color of three Oscar nominees is still an
issue, we haven't come very far at all.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In high politics, on talk shows, on exercise programs, in
infomercials, in college departments, in sports, in couples on the
streets, in medicine, in technology, in just about anything one can
think of, we see black people so well represented and functioning so
often as part of the American scene that all the noise about two
black men and one black woman being nominated for best actor and best
actress at the same time seems almost insane in 2002. But that is how
it is.</LD>
<LD>   As things now stand in the motion picture industry, it is also one
of the greatest ironies in the history of show business.</LD>
<LD>   This becomes especially obvious when one considers the indelible
impact that black people have had on American culture, and the fact
that the presence and that impact of black people on an Anglo-Saxon
and Protestant identity was in place before other important show
business ethnic groups--Irish, Italians and Jews--began immigrating
to this country in increasingly significant numbers from the middle
of the 19th century forward. All of those "almost" or "not quite"
whites became "true" whites as color came to obviate cultural
alienation and took on more importance than religion or national
origin.</LD>
<TE>   By the middle 1930s, ethnic particulars were of no importance if
one's color was right. Jewish, Irish and Italian actors and actresses
became stars and heartthrobs, and the better ones have continued to
enrich our understanding of our "Americanness" when the vehicles and
the directors have been right. By the time sound took off, even
so-called WASP features became less than significant when a guy like
Florenz Ziegfeld, who looked as "Jewish" as Woody Allen, could be
seen sitting behind his desk in a film from the early '30s talking
about those paragons of American beauty, the Ziegfeld Girls.</TE>
<TE>   One could not imagine any black American, no matter how far back
in the culture his family line might have gone, being accepted as the
man who helped define American beauty, which is to say what were
considered good-looking white women in that period.</TE>
<TE>   Today, of course, no one would get all hot and bothered and start
stomping on a soapbox if two Jewish or Italian American or Irish
American men and one woman were nominated in the same categories as
Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Halle Berry. At this juncture, we
still hear and read about the same point, which is what any of this
means for "the future of Hollywood." Will more black actors and
performers and directors and screenwriters and whoever else be picked
for success or parity with other successful ethnic groups? It would
be absurd to ask those questions if we were accustomed to anything
resembling genuine interest in quality, which is something we don't
see pursued very often.</TE>
<TE>   While it might not be unusual now for a high-quality fairy tale
like "The Lord of the Rings" to have an understandably strong chance
to win best picture, it would still be something of a surprise if
Berry or Washington walked up that aisle. I am not talking about
Smith because I do not see him as a serious contender. (He should
have been nominated for best supporting actor in the astonishing "Six
Degrees of Separation.")</TE>
<TE>   As for Berry and Washington, we have a human depiction of a black
woman that is more than quite rare and, on the other hand, a monster
rendered with such nuance in an absurdly simple-minded bad cop movie
that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would have to
embrace two very different things in order to hand off the statuettes
in both cases. It would have to recognize a black woman achieving
unexpected human dimensions and an extraordinary performance
transcending a frequently ridiculous context.</TE>
<TE>   Some will say that Berry is too good looking to get the Academy
Award because that would upset the "whites only" conception of
Hollywood beauty. That is followed by those who say that the only
reason Whoopi Goldberg got an Oscar or gets so much work is because
white actresses feel comfortable opposite her, that she is only an
update of the homely black women seen in the old movies, the ones
Lena Horne says she could not make because of the restrictions on
black female beauty. Yet, as "Soul Food" and anything else with an
actual representation of black women prove, we could greatly expand
our range of American female beauty if we were to embrace the sweep
of skin tones and features and hair textures that black actresses
have to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the other side. One younger black woman told me how
much rage she encountered among black Hollywood types when "Monster's
Ball" came up in conversation. Berry was accused of selling out for
taking the role and for her willingness to be filmed in such a
passionate erotic scene with a white man. This is not surprising
since black women from coast to coast went nuts and sometimes began
screaming at the screen when "their" Denzel was shown on screen with
a white woman in "He Got Game," another of the films, along with the
almost monumentally fresh "Devil in a Blue Dress," for which he
should have been nominated.</TE>
<TE>   So we find ourselves as Americans once more in a great big
black-and-white mess. Allowed to pick up a tradition shared by those
few black women who have ever been able to play a human being in a
Hollywood film, Berry might lose out because of racism or the fear of
offending somebody. Or she could lose out because voters don't want
to feel pushed into selecting her even if they know she went far past
anything that Sissy Spacek did in the exceedingly absurd "In the
Bedroom," which sinks from a film about grief and injustice into a
ridiculous revenge fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   What that film expects us to believe is much further out than the
romance between Berry and Billy Bob Thornton, a reinterpretation of
the beauty and the beast tale, which also says things beyond what we
tend to expect in a film that uses racial antipathy as a central
metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   "Monster's Ball" says that if we come from bigoted backgrounds, we
have to cut ourselves loose from those bigots, even if they are
family. It says that trauma may help us break free of our emptiness.
It says that if we are ever to go beyond our terrible past, we may
have to learn to forgive others who have changed just as we have to
face our own pain if we are to liberate ourselves from the enslaving
weight it can impose upon us. We rarely get such mature and truly
human visions from contemporary American film.</TE>
<TE>   As the buzz goes, Washington's major competition is supposed to be
Russell Crowe, who, however fine an actor, has yet to command the
American nuances that fellow Australians Anthony LaPaglia, Nicole
Kidman and Judy Davis have clearly mastered to a fare-thee-well. Of
course, if nuance was ever the issue, no one could have walked past
Laurence Fishburne in "What's Love Got to Do With It?" or Angela
Bassett in the same film or Washington in "X" and "Devil in a Blue
Dress," where he did so many things we had never seen before. It is
Washington's grasp of nuance at his best that separates him from the
pack, his ability to transform his eyes, his lips, his brow and the
rest of his face into such an imposing instrument that makes him one
of our very best actors. But nuance unrecognized is of no assistance
in a profession not always sure of what it should be about.</TE>
<TE>   When we get to black actors, we have another set of problems.
Versions of black Americans that we are familiar with on screen have
been so often either in the buffoon category or the overacted
category that they seem to eliminate all possibilities for subtlety.
Those who would make serious American films need, with great haste,
to dispense with that endless mountain of corny images that all
ethnic groups have had to suffer under. Cartoon stereotypes, whether
of the victim or the pious, fail to provide the human depth a film
truly needs.</TE>

<HD>The Actor's Life on Display in 'Showcase'</HD>
<DH>This Groundlings satire of the entertainment industry is
larger than life yet painfully accurate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You don't have to be a show biz insider to get a kick out of "Beverly
Winwood Presents The Actor's Showcase," the riotous new parody of
industry showcases at the Groundling Theatre. It's doubtful, however,
that the show would have such built-in audience appeal in, say,
Peoria.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that tourists fresh off the bus wouldn't get a few
laughs. After all, goofiness is a universal language, one in which
Tony Sepulveda, the former Groundling who conceived and directed this
enterprise, is fluent. However, the "industry showcase," where actors
desperate for exposure and representation perform scenes for an
invited industry audience, is a distinctly L.A. phenomenon. If you
have ever actively suffered through such a showcase--from either side
of the footlights--this home-grown send-up is guaranteed to make you
wince--and hoot--in uncomfortable recognition.</LD>
<LD>   As you enter the theater, you are handed a stack of photocopied
resumes while actors jockey nervously in the background. These are
the "student performers" from Beverly Winwood's acting class--rank
neophytes in desperate search of a break who troll the lobby, pre-
and post-show, for agents and casting directors. (As an added
incentive, free Twinkies and Cheez Whiz are served.)</LD>
<TE>   Padded with the dubious talents of the dubiously talented, the
resumes contain plaintive passages such as "Not SAG Yet--Just Need
One More Voucher." As for special skills, "Can Walk Fast" represents
a pinnacle of accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Liza Minnelli (Antoinette Spolar Levine) at
a career nadir, the showcase participants are obscure wannabes who
would consider a gig at Knott's Berry Farm a big break. The obvious
trick is that these "untalented unknowns" are actually comedy
veterans, many of national reputation, who are simply playing
untalented unknowns. At the end of the evening, you will receive a
small slip of paper--a key telling you who played whom.</TE>
<TE>   Study it carefully. Some of these performers, "names" though they
may be, are virtually unrecognizable here. Her face twisted in
comical anxiety, Mindy Sterling (of the "Austin Powers" movies) plays
a scene from "The Elephant Man" with fellow Groundling alum Tim
Bagley, a stroke victim in a wheelchair who keeps getting hung up in
the stage furniture. And isn't that Paul (Pee-wee Herman) Reubens,
teaming up once again with Lynne Marie Stewart (Miss Yvonne from the
"Playhouse") for a sidesplitting take on "Butterflies Are Free"?</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to unrecognizable, Jennifer Coolidge, fresh from her
Broadway run in "The Women," sports a sky-high beehive and
troweled-on makeup for her turn in "The Glass Menagerie." No, she's
not playing Amanda but a hilariously hard-bitten Laura. Just don't
mess with her unicorn.</TE>
<TE>   Perky Beverly Winwood (Susan Yeagley), resplendent in a platinum
pageboy, gets things rolling with a few appropriately inane comments.
Of course, this is one long in-joke, and the high concept
occasionally wears thin. But this brief and delightfully inane
outing, which will feature new scenes and new performers on a
revolving basis, revels in delicious dreadfulness. So do we.</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly Winwood Presents the Actor's Showcase," Groundling
Theatre, 7307 Melrose Ave., L.A. Mondays only, 8 p.m. Ends June 3.
$10. (323) 934-9700. Running time: 1 hour.</TE>

<HD>Rock Embraces Its Onetime Challengers</HD>
<DH>Hall of Fame inducts punk and new wave rebels the Ramones
and Talking Heads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN GAMBOA</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Only rock 'n' roll would be so brazen.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-five years ago, the punks and the new-wavers burst on the
scene, desperately setting out to destroy what rock had become and
turn it into something new. On Monday night, the same rockers that
were rebelled against welcomed the infidels into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame with champagne toasts, warm words and, of course, lots
of loud music.</LD>
<LD>   "Rock 'n' roll's instinctive ability to absorb helps keep it
alive," said Seymour Stein, the Sire Records executive who signed new
hall members the Ramones and Talking Heads. "Tonight, we celebrate
the first inductees from the punk and new wave eras."</LD>
<TE>   Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, who inducted the Ramones at the
black-tie soiree at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, said he worried that
the punks from Forest Hills would never get their due for spawning
the musical revolution of the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Ramones] became a beacon for anyone who wanted to be in a
band," said Vedder, sporting a Mohawk haircut and a soul patch.
"Within weeks, kids were forming their own bands.... You didn't have
to be a virtuoso or be genetically gifted with Elvis' cheekbones....
The Ramones were our Beatles."</TE>
<TE>   The group's original drummer, Tommy Ramone, accepting the honor,
thanked his bandmates who were inducted (singer Joey Ramone, who died
last year of cancer, guitarist Johnny Ramone, bassist Dee Dee Ramone
and drummer Marky Ramone), as well as later member C.J. Ramone, who
was not inducted. "We really loved each other, even when we weren't
being civil to each other," said Tommy. "This honor means a lot to
us. But it would really have meant everything to Joey."</TE>
<TE>   The Rock Hall's Class of 2002 also included funk master Isaac
Hayes, rockabilly-country sweetheart Brenda Lee, rockers Tom Petty &amp;
the Heartbreakers, emotional '60s heartthrob Gene Pitney, Stax
Records co-founder Jim Stewart as the "non-performer" inductee and
Chet Atkins as the "sideman" inductee.</TE>
<TE>   The 17th annual inductions brought the Hall of Fame membership to
192. An artist becomes eligible 25 years after the release of his or
her first album.</TE>
<TE>   Petty, who wrote such hits as "Refugee" and "Free Fallin'," was
inducted by the Wallflowers' Jakob Dylan, who recalled how he used to
watch from the wings as his father, Bob Dylan, performed with Petty
as part of the Traveling Wilburys.</TE>
<TE>   Petty gave perhaps the best summary of the evening: "'Rock 'n'
roll star' is probably the purest mainstream manifestation of the
American dream," said the singer, who rolled out a rocking version of
"American Girl" after receiving the award. "It is a blessing beyond
belief. At its best, music really is a true magic. It's liberated so
many people in this world."</TE>
<TE>   In his comments, Hayes pleaded with the music industry audience to
help musicians of his generation get all that's owed to them for past
work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just asking you to practice some business ethics and a little
humanity," he said. "Do the right thing by me and my contemporaries."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the evening, the traditional all-star jam was
missing some faces, including the Ramones, Petty, Lee and Vedder. The
jam was hampered by long delays and technical difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why the Ramones hadn't participated in the closing
festivities, Talking Heads' Jerry Harrison said with a smile, "The
Ramones don't jam."</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Gamboa is a pop music writer at Newsday, a Tribune Co.
newspaper. Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of Monday's ceremonies will be televised tonight at 9
on VH1.</TE>

<HD>A Night of Surprises From Osiris Piano Trio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Music Guild was struck by more of those infuriating last-minute
program changes Monday night at Cal State Northridge; one entered the
concert hall primed for certain pieces and got others instead.</LD>
<LD>   The Osiris Piano Trio was originally set to play Schubert's Piano
Trio, Opus 100, but several days ago there was an announced switch to
the Opus 99 Trio. Yet by curtain time, Opus 100 was back in place.
Then, when preparation time fell short, another previously announced
piece, the Ravel Trio, went over the side, replaced by one of the
Dutch group's home-grown commissions, Roel van Oosten's 1992
Pianotrio. Sigh.</LD>
<LD>   The one piece untouched by the upheavals, Beethoven's Piano Trio,
Opus 1, No. 3, received the most polished performance, with the
piano, violin and cello blending fluidly, if not with completely
optimum balance--from the left side of the hall, the fully opened
piano seemed to dominate.</LD>
<TE>   At the sacrifice of a bit of its earlier precision, the Osiris
produced more passion, momentum and rhetorical power in the Schubert
Opus 100, which in a good performance hardly ever fails to cast its
spell, with its mesmerizing tunes and the treading rhythm of the
second movement. The Van Oosten piece turned out to be an agreeable,
often turbulent, mildly dissonant work in four classical movements,
with faint mechanistic whiffs of Prokofiev and Bartok, but hardly a
trace of the jazz influence promised in the program notes. Though not
something that grabs you by the lapels, the piece is an encouraging
sign of the Dutch government's willingness to sponsor new music and
Osiris' desire to pursue it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This program will repeat tonight at 8 at the Wilshire Ebell
Theatre, 4401 W. 8th St., L.A. (310) 552-3030.</TE>

<HD>New Competitor at the Bench</HD>
<DH>Music* Piano contests can be as rife with intrigue as
figure skating, but officials of the new Rachmaninoff event in
Pasadena hope their rules set it apart.</DH>

<LD>Thirty young musicians from around the globe will arrive in Pasadena
this week for two weeks of concerts, competition and serious practice
in the new Rachmaninoff International Piano Competition and Festival,
the latest entry in the crowded world of music contests.</LD>
<LD>   The event--a joint venture of the Russian Ministry of Culture, the
city of Pasadena and Pasadena's Master Classes International, a
nonprofit that brings international artists to Los Angeles in various
teaching programs--will cover travel expenses for the 30 pianists,
ages 18 to 30, who were selected from 75 hopefuls from 25 countries
who entered themselves into the competition via videotaped auditions.</LD>
<LD>   A first round of recitals will narrow the field to 12, and a
second round will produce six finalists. Those six will be required
to play two more pieces--a Beethoven concerto and a Rachmaninoff
piece--in two more rounds to determine the grand prize winner, who
will be awarded $30,000 and a Kawai professional grand piano valued
at $28,000.</LD>
<TE>   Douglas Yoder, executive director of the competition, acknowledges
the difficulty of launching a new piano competition into a world
dominated by such well-established events as the Tchaikovsky, Leeds
and Van Cliburn competitions, held in Russia, England, and Texas,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Yoder says there is room for one more--and offers that a
Rachmaninoff competition is particularly apt for Los Angeles, because
the Russian emigre composer, pianist and conductor performed at the
Pasadena Civic Auditorium and died in Beverly Hills in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   And, though others in the piano competition can--and do--disagree
on the matter, Yoder thinks the world of piano competitions is due
for an ethical overhaul, comparing the scene with ice skating events
at this year's Winter Olympic Games. There are numerous examples of
judging controversies in piano competition, including a scene in the
1980 Chopin Competition in Warsaw, Poland, when pianist Martha
Argerich stormed off the jury to protest the early elimination of
young pianist Ivo Pogorelich.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble followed Pogorelich to Pasadena in 1993, when charges of
nepotism on the jury swirled around the first Ivo Pogorelich
International Solo Piano Competition at Ambassador Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   "This scandal that happened with the Olympics would be small
potatoes for a piano competition," asserts Yoder, referring to the
much-publicized controversy in pairs figure skating that led to gold
medals for both the Russian and Canadian pairs. "On a scale of 1 to
10, [that] would be a 2 or 3, compared to the horse trading that goes
on."</TE>
<TE>   Yoder says that the Rachmaninoff Competition has lured a stellar
panel of judges by promising "a competition in the old way," with a
set of controls in place to prevent politicization.</TE>
<TE>   This year's 13-member jury includes celebrated Russian pianist
Vladimir Ashkenazy, first-prize winner in the 1962 Tchaikovsky
Competition; Russian pianist Dmitri Bashkirov; American concert
pianist Byron Janis; and pianist Earl Wild, 86, who performed with
Otto Klemperer and Arturo Toscanini.</TE>
<TE>   Wild, who has served as a judge for several competitions,
including the Van Cliburn in the 1980s, echoes Yoder's claims that
many piano competitions have become incestuous, with some judges
pushing their own students or pupils of their friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I found it revolting; that sort of did me in [for competitions]
for a while," he says. "But I've always been connected to
Rachmaninoff's music. I thought I would try again."</TE>
<TE>   Via e-mail, Ashkenazy, who rarely acts as a competition judge,
said the theme of the competition was a draw: "Rachmaninoff has
always been very important to my musical life, and therefore it is
appropriate that I have a very modest input in this festival."</TE>
<TE>   Master Classes International, the organization overseeing the
event, was founded by Armenian musician Armen Ter-Tatevosian, a
10-year Los Angeles resident, who served as general manager of music
programming for USSR State Radio for the Republic of Armenia and held
the title of resident pianist for the USSR State Radio and Television
Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The organization maintains partnerships with the Moscow
Tchaikovsky Conservatory of Music and the Chopin Academy of Music in
Warsaw. Alexandre Rachmaninoff, grandson of the composer and head of
the Rachmaninoff Foundation in London, chairs the festival committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Rachmaninoff Competition was announced two years ago with a
proposed budget of $3 million to $3.5 million. Since then, the
competition's budget has been scaled back to a more modest $1
million--including $300,000 from the Russian Ministry of Culture, to
cover the costs of bringing the Moscow Radio Symphony to Pasadena to
play during the competition; a $350,000 donation from Los
Angeles-based Pipeline Music, which controls the rights to the
classical music archives of the Russian Federation; about $200,000 in
money and in-kind donations from the city of Pasadena; and the rest
from private donations.</TE>
<TE>   Recent California state budget cuts, the rocky stock market and a
dearth of major corporate grants caused festival organizers to adjust
downward. As a result, many of the "festival" aspects of the event
have been eliminated, including a multi-city tour of the winners and
an April 1 concert at the Kodak Theatre featuring the Moscow Radio
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow Radio Symphony will accompany the pianists in the
Rachmaninoff round of the finals competition; they will perform
Beethoven with the Pasadena Symphony. Along with the grand prize,
second and third prizes of $20,000 and $15,000 respectively will be
awarded, as well as $5000 to the remaining three finalists, and $2500
each to the six semifinalists who don't make the final rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yoder calls the procedure for the Rachmaninoff Competition
superior to that of most piano competitions. For one thing, no judge
may have been a teacher to any competitor for three years before the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some of the judges at the Pasadena event also participated
in the preliminary rounds, judging the videotaped entries. Yoder says
it is often the case that the more prestigious judges only
participate during the final rounds, when the field has been weeded
out by what is often, in his estimation, a less discerning panel. (He
acknowledges that Ashkenazy will only judge the Rachmaninoff final
rounds, due to scheduling problems.)</TE>
<TE>   'Interesting Pianists,</TE>
<TE>   Some Real Personalities'</TE>
<TE>   "The preliminary juries tend to select people who play fast,
technically well and safely, but are not that interesting," Yoder
says. "Anybody who knows the piano knows that it is almost impossible
to play the piano with a lot of artistic interest and note-perfect at
the same time.</TE>
<TE>   What has come out of [the Rachmaninoff process so far] is some
really interesting pianists, some real personalities--the kind of
people who get shut out of other competitions."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Rodzinski, president of the Van Cliburn Foundation and
vice president of the World Federation of Music Competitions, an
umbrella organization based in Geneva, disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   Though he acknowledges that eliminating politics remains a
constant battle for the federation, he describes the competition
rules at, for instance, the Van Cliburn competition as "lily-white
and crystal-clean."</TE>
<TE>   In the Van Cliburn event, Rodzinski says, a competitor's teacher
may be on the judging panel but must abstain from voting on that
competitor. He adds that no judges are added or changed in the final
rounds of the competition, and says that that requirement is standard
in most major piano competitions."There is absolutely no horse
trading because the scores are immediately made public to the jury,"
Rodzinski says of the Van Cliburn competition. "If anybody is trying
to do any monkey business, all his colleagues will see it right
away."</TE>
<TE>   Rodzinski expressed surprise, however, upon being told that during
the Rachmaninoff competition judges' individual scores will be posted
on a Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Very often, you will want to maintain close collegial
relationships with a lot of these [competitors] for years afterward;
how difficult would it be to do that if you know that a certain judge
slammed you?" Rodzinski says.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the Rachmaninoff Piano Competition and Festival
breaks new ground when it comes to judging, at least one observer
says that the time, and the place, is right to launch a new piano
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Piano festivals are a dime a dozen, but I think this is a very
smart move," said Willem Wijnbergen, former executive director of the
Los Angeles Philharmonic and now director of the Carmel Bach
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "The way they are going about the U.S.-Russia alliance is very
smart, and I think Pasadena, right now, is a classical music
producers' heaven, because there is a real community there. The
resources and the mind-set are there.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a whole romantic component to [Rachmaninoff's] music; if
you are a smart producer, you can milk the romance out of it; people
like romance. And there's also the connection with L.A. You can
connect all these dots and come up with quite a picture."</TE>

<HD>Clayton Trio Plays With Joy of Youth</HD>

<LD>The performance by the Gerald Clayton Trio on Monday night in
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill's Young Artist Jazz Series should have been
videotaped for future use. One of those uses would be the opportunity
for more jazz fans to hear and see these remarkable young musicians
in action. An equally important use would be to screen it for the far
too many professional artists who seem to have forgotten the
individual excitement, the spirited coming together and the sheer joy
of making music.</LD>
<LD>   Clayton, a pianist, is still in his final year at the L.A. County
High School for the Arts; bassist Miles Mosley and drummer Kevin
Kanner are a few years older. But individually and collectively,
their performance was at a stunningly high professional
level--enhanced by the enthusiastic feeling of exhilaration in
everything they played. No wonder the packed-house crowd gave the
trio a standing ovation, demanding and receiving a spirited encore.</LD>
<TE>   There wasn't a dull moment in a set that lasted well beyond an
hour, encompassing a collection of tunes ranging from "The Frim Fram
Sauce" and "Jada" to "Yours Is My Heart Alone" and "Emily." Enhancing
this offbeat group of numbers, Clayton added his own tender ballad,
"Tears," and Mosley's highly whimsical "Pell City Slouch." Although
Clayton noted, after the set, that the trio members have been too
busy individually to perform together on a regular basis, there were
no flaws in their ensemble interaction, which functioned with
unerringly smooth fluidity.</TE>
<TE>   Individually, potential star power was flashing everywhere.
Clayton's interpretive range comfortably embraced bebop, stride and
swing, enhanced by the sort of dramatic shifts of dynamics associated
with Ahmad Jamal and the groove-driven rhythms of Gene Harris. Mosley
was a technical wizard, enhancing his virtuosity with a buoyant sense
of swing and a witty sense of humor. And Kanner's drum work was a
model of musicality, balancing urgent rhythmic energy with a subtle
control of his percussive textures.</TE>
<TE>   The performance offered a telling glimpse of the quality present
among the Southland's younger, still-undiscovered artists. The Young
Artist Jazz Series will continue to showcase similar talent once a
month at Catalina's, with the Agoura High School Jazz Band, conducted
by John Mosley, scheduled next, on April 29.</TE>

<DH>Eva Hesse's brief but masterful coupling of painting and
sculpture disrupted fixed ideas about art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--Two aspects of the magnificent Eva Hesse exhibition
organized at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art make this an
indispensable show. (It's on view through May 19 in its only U.S.
showing.) One has to do with the past, the other with the present.</LD>
<LD>   For the past, Hesse's classic sculptures loom large. They were
made between the fall of 1965 and her tragic death from brain cancer
in May 1970, at age 34, and they exploit such once unlikely
sculptural materials as latex, polyester resin and fiberglass. Among
these two dozen pieces are some of the finest works made by any
postwar American artist. Hesse, a German-born expatriate, was central
to the establishment of an artistic vocabulary that defined art for
the next quarter-century.</LD>
<LD>   For the present, though, it's the far less familiar work that's
unusually compelling--work Hesse made between her graduation from
Yale's art school in 1959 and the breakthrough to her mature
sculpture in late 1965. In recent years, art has been undergoing a
slow sea change, and the idiom she was so pivotal in establishing is
passing into history. You stand before the great classic sculptures
in reverential awe, mentally genuflecting in obedient wonder.
However, the early work remains unruly and strange, thus offering
something potentially useful for new art today.</LD>
<TE>   If the brief, decade-long career of so young an artist can be
divided into two phases, then the late work has entered the pantheon
of universally acclaimed masterpieces. There's a lesson in this. As a
young artist in 1959 Hesse faced a seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
Her big dilemma was what to do about Abstract Expressionist painting,
which she loved. Painting was then the paramount art form for a
serious artist, and Abstract Expressionism was its orthodoxy. Hesse
had gone to school to become a painter. (At Yale she studied with
Josef Albers, Rico Lebrun and Bernard Chaet.) But she made her mark
by other means.</TE>
<TE>   Look at it this way: Abstract Expressionist painting was to a
young artist in 1959 as Hesse's classic sculpture is to young artists
today. Her achievement was to find a path around the obstacle. She
disrupted fixed ideas about what was possible for art--and what was
not. That brilliant success eventually made her own work a fixed idea
about what's possible for art. She's become an obstacle in turn.</TE>
<TE>   What did Hesse's classic sculptures do? Artistic doctrine in the
mid-1960s insisted that the measure of quality for any art form could
be found in its refinement of that form's unique properties. So Hesse
went the other way, gaily obliterating categorical distinctions
between painting and sculpture. Purity was chucked for a hybrid
aesthetic. Hesse made mongrels.</TE>
<TE>   With surprisingly few exceptions, a classic Hesse sculpture is
suspended or hangs on the wall--the preferred mode for a painting. If
it does stand on the floor, like "Schema" or "Sequel" (both
1967-1968), the sculpture is often a flat sheet, like a painting,
with objects placed on top.</TE>
<TE>   In a normal painting a line is two-dimensional. A line in a Hesse
is often an actual length of wire, painted rope or rubber tubing
knotted at the end. The rope or rubber tubing is allowed to hang, so
that sculptural properties of weight and gravity defy expectations
and are forced to apply to line.</TE>
<TE>   An untitled 1970 piece is a tangle of rope and string coated in
latex and suspended from the ceiling on metal hooks. This sculpture,
one of Hesse's final works, most blatantly returns to the look of
Abstract Expressionism. It mimics the tangled skeins of dripped color
in a Jackson Pollock painting but makes them into material objects
suspended in actual space. And the labored, calculated construction
of the work removes any sense of naturalism or psychic spontaneity
that is usually associated with Expressionist art.</TE>
<TE>   Hesse's painterly transformations took another important step.
Color is notably suppressed in her classic work.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, color just disappears halfway through the show, upon the
arrival of her mature art. Color, an integral feature of painting,
was then being advanced as the main ingredient of faltering abstract
art, as reflected in the term Color-field painting. And it was
critical to the splashy look of abstraction's chief rival, Pop art.
Hesse pulled the plug on color, replacing it with shades of gray or
the golden brown translucence of latex, resin and fiberglass.</TE>
<TE>   These plastic materials perform critical functions. (Inherently
unstable, they are also proving to be a conservation nightmare, which
is another reason to see the show now: Given its fragility, Hesse's
work isn't likely to be assembled for another retrospective any time
soon.) Plastics, so wickedly lampooned by Hollywood in "The Graduate"
(1967), which was released just before she began to use the material,
held negative social connotations. But Hesse didn't use these
industrial materials in mechanical ways. Handmade and courting light,
her sculptural surfaces instead yield the disconcerting look of skin.</TE>
<TE>   In "Sans II" (1968), which may be her greatest single work, the
wide double row of wall-hung boxes made from polyester resin and
fiberglass takes all this to a crescendo. The machine-like repetition
of neutral forms could go on forever, but no two boxes are the same.
They're irregular in fabrication. The plastic surfaces are like a
fleshy membrane. Light and space, which paintings contrive, are
corporeal.</TE>
<TE>   Is it absurd to use sculptural materials to make paintings?
Yes--exuberantly so. The undercurrent of sheer improbability that
runs through this work attests to the period's fascination with
Neo-Dada art.</TE>
<TE>   So does its peculiar eroticism. Marcel Duchamp, the father of
Dada, conceived of art as a faltering erotic machine. In Hesse's work
assorted suggestions of male and female anatomy do recur. Yet, an
even more fundamental artistic coupling also takes place: Painting
awkwardly attempts to mate with sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Hesse started out as a painter when she graduated Yale in 1959,
and in a very real sense she was a painter when she died 11 years
later (almost to the day). The era just made it impossible for her
paintings to look like paintings typically do. So, she found ways to
articulate the predicament.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Hesse's early work grabs attention now. The San
Francisco retrospective isn't all that different from the pioneering
one organized at the Yale Art Gallery in 1992, but the attractions in
it have certainly changed. The current show adds several sculptures
from late in her career, but it's the addition of several paintings
and numerous drawings from 1959 to mid-1965 that was inspired.</TE>
<TE>   They're unresolved as works of art--and that's the point. Hesse is
like a vacuum cleaner here, taking in whatever came her way and
caught her fancy, and then mixing it up. When the velvet fist of
artistic orthodoxy has you in its grip, this work asserts, keep
yourself open to trying just about anything.</TE>
<TE>   Think Eva Hesse, and you don't readily think lime green, acid
yellow and hot pink. You don't conjure Surrealist shapes or junk
assemblage sculpture. Arshile Gorky, Willem DeKooning, Joseph
Cornell, Louise Nevelson and Jasper Johns are not the precedents who
come to mind. But all that and much more is there in her early work,
churning around like the roiling thoughts of an especially curious
and hungry mind.</TE>
<TE>   It all seems very "of the moment" for art in the 1960s. And it's a
moment that is here again today.</TE>

<LD>   Interest groups frequently contend television beats them up by
presenting misleading, negative or overly dramatic images--from
Italian American activists fuming over "The Sopranos" to African
Americans who protested "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer." Even
professions join in, with lawyers, doctors and teachers occasionally
getting huffy about the way they're depicted on programs like "Ally
McBeal," "ER" and "Boston Public," just as cops question the realism
of action-packed crime shows or the police corruption on FX's new
drama "The Shield."</LD>
<LD>   There's no question that television has a way of making characters
look silly or inept, while at the same time cramming more drama into
individual episodes than the average cop or doctor sees in a
lifetime. Yet those who feel especially abused, mistreated or beaten
up should pay attention to the way TV slaps itself around, with fresh
examples arriving next week in the form of two new comedy series,
ABC's "Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)" and Fox's "Greg the Bunny."</LD>
<TE>   Call it fear and self-loathing in TV land.</TE>
<TE>   When outsiders register these complaints, the theme usually boils
down to this: "The world portrayed on television is not
representative of my reality as a [fill in the blank]. It makes me/my
group look stupid." Indeed, if vampires, aliens and genetically
engineered humans had unions, they'd doubtless voice concerns about
the outrageous stereotyping on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "3rd Rock
From the Sun" and "Dark Angel."</TE>
<TE>   Minority groups also point out, with some justification, that
negative portrayals of them can be especially damaging, because it
might be days before a Latino cast as a drug dealer is
counterbalanced by the prime-time presentation of a Latino as an
upstanding citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's hard to come up with a group more unrelentingly
depicted as buffoonish, self-absorbed and loathsome than television
executives, whose images seem to be getting worse as we advance into
the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its merits as a comedy, "Wednesday" is a triple-threat in
this regard: Not only does the ABC sitcom make TV executives look
like colossal morons, ranging from neurotic and venal to flagrantly
disingenuous, but it lays on inside jokes (beginning with the title)
and still manages to be wildly unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   How unrealistic? Well, the action unfolds through the eyes of a
fresh-faced newcomer from the Midwest with no previous TV experience
(played by Ivan Sergei), just hired in a programming job at the
fictitious network.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, that happens every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Greg the Bunny," meanwhile, features a children's TV show that
mixes humans and puppets (the gimmick: The puppets are real),
and--surprise!--another assortment of crazed producers and
executives, joined by self-centered stars of both the human and cloth
variety.</TE>
<TE>   There is, of course, a well-established tradition of show-business
denizens being portrayed as back-stabbing bottom-feeders. Hoary
examples such as "The Dick Van Dyke Show," "All About Eve" and "The
Bad and the Beautiful" have given way to more recent instances such
as the meddling network executives on "Sports Night" and "The Larry
Sanders Show," the get-away-with-murder studio exec in "The Player,"
or the do-anything-for-a-rating producers and executives in "The
Truman Show," "EdTV" and the just-released "Showtime."</TE>
<TE>   Hookers may have a heart of gold at times on TV, but don't hold
your breath waiting for an equally benign view of Hollywood's
hucksters. In fact, the only sympathetic character that comes to mind
was the network chief in Showtime's "Beggars and Choosers," which may
have to do with him being modeled after a real network chief, the
late Brandon Tartikoff, who helped conceive the show.</TE>
<TE>   Though they don't write these TV shows or films, the fact networks
and studios keep buying them tells you something either about their
willingness to laugh at themselves or the way they see their
world--and presume the world sees them.</TE>
<TE>   The definitive image, no doubt, remains Faye Dunaway's amoral
programming czar in "Network," a film released in 1976 that seemingly
becomes more prophetic with each passing day--something TV executives
seem to realize, intuitively or consciously, based on some of their
recent programming choices.</TE>
<TE>   How else do you account for "Celebrity Boxing," the special
broadcast last week by the Fox network, which pitted notorious
has-beens against each other? (Fox is repeating "Celebrity Boxing" on
Thursday, by the way, no doubt as a public service to those who
missed it.)</TE>
<TE>   Fox led with its chin, hoping the media would rise to the bait and
bash the special. For the most part, the network got its wish,
generating plenty of negative articles and snide TV news
coverage--even on competing channels, which ran footage from the
bouts as if they were a legitimate event.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Fox saw the critical drubbing as free promotion at a
time when networks are so desperate for attention there's seldom such
a thing as bad press. Stripped to its core, then, "Celebrity Boxing"
was a plaintive cry for help, the network's way of saying, "We'll
take you any way we can get you." Talk about throwing in the towel.</TE>
<TE>   Given the triumph of that philosophy, the show-business
stereotypes cited above don't seem quite as far removed from reality.
What they fail to explore, however, is the fact that few people got
into the entertainment business aspiring to nothing more than winning
a time slot, having adopted Raiders owner Al Davis' motto "Just win,
baby" in the course of running their daily rat race.</TE>
<TE>   Does this explain why the TV industry characters we see on TV tend
to be such caricatures--the sort of hollow, depth-free shells any
interest group would rightly protest? Is "Wednesday" its own
expensive form of therapy? Or is it just that television by necessity
distorts reality to make it entertaining--that while there are high
schools with less gunplay, sex and controversy than the one in
"Boston Public," we probably wouldn't tune in each week to watch
teachers grade papers and plan homework?</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, it's probably no accident that network
programmers keep smacking themselves in the head. And if "Celebrity
Boxing" is truly the best they can do, one hopes they knock some
sense into themselves.</TE>

<LD>   'Hee Haw' Has the Last Laugh, Laughs First</LD>
<LD>   "Crying Time"? Not for Buck Owens. The country singer, "Hee Haw"
star and entrepreneur finds himself in good company in the March
issue of Worth magazine, which features an intriguing ranking of
America's wealthiest citizens. The "richest person in town" list
names the most affluent resident in each of the top 100 U.S.
metropolitan areas, and Owens takes the title for Bakersfield.</LD>
<TE>   Add up royalties from years of songwriting and four dozen Top 10
country hits (among them "Crying Time," "Act Naturally" and "Together
Again"), the paychecks from his 15-year run on "Hee Haw" and--most
important--his profits from buying and selling radio stations, and
the 72-year-old Owens ends up with a net worth of $125 million, the
magazine reports.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how many bucks he has in the bank, Owens told Worth he's
been happy to call Bakersfield home for 50 years. "There ain't," he
said, "no better place to live."</TE>

<TE>   Fast Music a Driving Distraction, Study Says</TE>
<TE>   Fast music can be harmful to your health--at least, if you're
behind the wheel. According to a study in Israel, drivers who listen
to up-tempo tunes may have more than twice as many accidents as those
listening to slower tracks.</TE>
<TE>   That finding, reports NewScientist.com, is especially worrisome
because the car is now the place where people most often listen to
music.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Brodsky tested 28 of his students at Ben-Gurion University
in Beer-Sheva, using a driving simulator. While they drove around
simulated streets of Chicago, the students listened to music ranging
from laid-back George Benson ballads to driving club fare--played
very loud. As the tempo increased, they were found to take greater
risks, such as jumping red lights. And they had more than twice as
many accidents--suggesting that what they listened to made them less
alert.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more research into the effects of distractions in cars,"
said Roger Vincent of Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of
Accidents.</TE>

<TE>   Oscar Pales to Getting Knighted, Kingsley Says</TE>
<TE>   Ben Kingsley was knighted on Tuesday, an honor that he told Queen
Elizabeth II was far greater than receiving an Academy Award.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the queen that winning an Oscar pales into insignificance.
This is insurmountable," Kingsley said after the ceremony at
Buckingham Palace in London. The 58-year-old won a best actor Oscar
for starring in the 1982 movie "Gandhi" and is up for best supporting
actor in the gangster thriller "Sexy Beast."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been nominated for an Academy Award, but I will be sitting
there, in Los Angeles, thinking I'm a knight bachelor," he said. The
Oscar ceremony is on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Redgrave, who first gained fame with the title role in
"Georgy Girl" in 1966 and earned a 1998 Academy Award nomination for
"Gods and Monsters," was invested Tuesday as an Officer of the Order
of British Empire, or OBE.</TE>

last fall, with 19.5 million people tuning in each week--up 19% from
the same period in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The network cites Arbitron ratings data as showing an average gain
of 19% for NPR news- magazines, 32% for NPR talk shows and 15% for
NPR entertainment programs. Not coincidentally, the period of study
covered the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.,
when the public appetite for all news outlets was heightened.</TE>

<TE>   Kisses Up to Revlon</TE>
<TE>   The daytime soap opera "All My Children" has sold its newest story
line to cosmetics giant Revlon. Daily Variety reported Tuesday that
Revlon is paying ABC between $3 million and $7 million to be featured
on the daytime series.</TE>
<TE>   Real-life Revlon will serve as the archrival to the fictional
Enchantment brand of beauty products owned by Erica Kane (played by
the series' longtime star Susan Lucci). The story line will be
featured over the course of three months, or 25 episodes, during
which Revlon will pay to run support ads.</TE>
<TE>   Revlon had no comment on the report, and ABC spokeswoman Sallie
Schoneboom told Associated Press that the story idea was generated by
the show's writers.</TE>

<HD>Weilersteins Show Range of Emotions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the great nature versus nurture debate, the Weilerstein Trio can
represent either or both sides of the argument. Pianist Vivian Hornik
Weilerstein and violinist Donald Weilerstein are married. The cellist
is their 19-year-old daughter, Alisa.</LD>
<LD>   The trio made its Orange County debut Monday at the Irvine Barclay
Theatre with a program of Mozart, Shostakovich and Dvorak as part of
the ever-enterprising Laguna Chamber Music Series.</LD>
<LD>   Attention immediately focused on Alisa Weilerstein, partly because
of her youth, partly because she is one of those musicians actively
involved in making music. She registers every emotion physically,
with every nuance of phrasing evident on her face.</LD>
<TE>   She bobs and weaves, arcs back into a transported state, draws the
music out of her body as if the cello is an extension of herself. She
must have a prodigious memory because much of the time she didn't
seem to be looking at a score.</TE>
<TE>   Some might find her intensity hard to watch, but interestingly,
the sound is never exaggerated. It is appropriately alive and
passionate, but never beyond the bounds of good taste.</TE>
<TE>   You can see from where she gets her expressiveness. Her mother is
a physical pianist, one who leans into and away from the keyboard,
rising from the bench as she punctuates rhythms. But again, the sound
is not out of bounds. It is beautifully calculated not to intrude or
overwhelm her colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Alisa's father, Donald--founding member and first violinist of the
Cleveland Quartet for 20 years--is the traditionalist in the sense
that he lets the music do the talking, not his body. Yet there is
nothing withdrawn or lacking in his sound.</TE>
<TE>   The three played Shostakovich's Trio No. 2 in E minor with
intimate knowledge and consummate expression, almost as if the
complex, heart-rending work had been written for them.</TE>
<TE>   We know it was motivated by the death of a close friend of the
composer's, though early audiences found its emotional shifts, from
light to serious, disconcerting. The Weilersteins made it all one
embracing whole, culminating in the horrifying dance macabre based on
Yiddish rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   This is a very risky piece to put on a program. The only
appropriate response at the end is dead silence, which is what they
got for a long, breathless moment before the inevitable applause.</TE>
<TE>   After intermission, they showed that Dvorak's Trio in F minor,
Opus 65 is a work unjustly overshadowed by his more familiar "Dumky"
Trio (Opus 90). The way the group handled the shifts in light and
dark in the slow movement alone seemed to sum up a lifetime of
experience, while the shift to the major key before the end seemed a
benediction from composer to audience.</TE>
<TE>   Father and daughter opened the program with Mozart's Sonata in C
for Violin and Basso (cello), a charming bagatelle written when the
composer was all of 12. The three played "Fall" from Astor
Piazzolla's "The Four Seasons" as their single encore.</TE>

<HD>His Music Is Here, There, Everywhere</HD>
<DH>Henry Brant's 'Glossary' is the highlight of a disjointed
Green Umbrella concert devoted to the Schoenberg legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've heard a lot of Schoenberg this season. But we've heard very
little of what he wrought. The composers he taught and influenced
ranged from European Modernists to American film composers, from
academics to the avant-garde, here and abroad. That legacy was
ostensibly left to the CalArts New Century Players, the guest
ensemble at the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Green Umbrella Concert on
Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   CalArts seemed to get on the bandwagon for a while, beginning the
program with works by Earl Kim and John Cage, two of Schoenberg's Los
Angeles students. Olga Neuwirth, a 33-year-old avant-garde composer,
was selected, however, simply because she is Viennese, as was
Schoenberg, and interesting.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Henry Brant, who will turn 90 next year. He had no
connection with Schoenberg, but he reminded the audience that he is
the second-oldest active American composer of "nonpopular music."
Elliott Carter, at 92, is now the oldest, with the death of Leo
Ornstein three weeks earlier at age 108 or 109. That, Brant said of
Ornstein's longevity, "shows you what an American composer can do if
he puts his mind to it."</LD>
<TE>   Brant has the reputation of being something of a kook who has long
put his mind to expanding music in space, the more grandiose the
better. He is small and feisty and performs in sweat clothes and
baseball cap--always color-coordinated and sometimes quite
bright--and he likes nothing better than to command large troupes of
musicians in vast public spaces, be they cathedrals, public squares
or the Amstel River in Amsterdam. Performers stand, sit, move about,
float, and each musician or ensemble plays something different. An
ingenious contrapuntist, Brant calculates just what music will fit
where, and the effect is invariably exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Brant brilliantly transforms any space, large or small,
he gets his hands on. "Glossary," which he conducted at Zipper
Concert Hall on Monday, was, for him, intimate. A dozen
instrumentalists surrounded the audience. Percussion was on the
stage, winds along the aisles, strings in back. A mezzo-soprano,
Jacqueline Bobak, sang flourishes while roving on high along the
parapets above the stage. Her text was based on computer terms and
acronyms. Brant conducted in his way, which was cueing performers by
making gestures that mimicked the playing of invisible instruments.
The piece, a recent one from 2000, lasted about 25 minutes. It was
wonderfully well performed and an utter delight.</TE>
<TE>   What does Brant's music sound like? The individual parts are
snippets with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Playful
ornamental lines in the winds may be countered by dramatic outbursts
in the percussion and soulful chords in the strings, but there is
never any competition. Instead, the hall appears to expand its
dimensions to contain anything Brant wants to put in it, becoming a
joyful universe in which there is room for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   With "Glossary," CalArts demonstrated that it really knows how to
put on a concert. And with "Glossary" and all that preceded it, it
demonstrated that it really doesn't know how to put on a concert.
Brant was relegated to the end of a long evening (he didn't appear
until 10:15), after which time half the audience had already left.
And although what came before the Brant was worthy, there was
generally too little consideration for an audience. The pre-concert
talk began 25 minutes late; a necessary close eye was not kept on
Brant, who never appeared for that talk; insufficient program notes
added mystification rather than clarity.</TE>
<TE>   All this, and the late hour, could wear out all but the most
hearty listener. Kim's "Where Grief Slumbers," beautiful and delicate
settings of Rimbaud and Apollinaire, were sensitively played and
effectively sung by soprano Kati Prescott-Terray, but there were no
texts provided, not even titles. Cage's "Sixteen Dances," a
transitional work written in 1951 in which the composer began
considering the possibility of using chance methods for composition,
was originally intended to be a full evening work for Merce
Cunningham and three other dancers, based on the Indian philosophy of
the emotions. Here it was used as an opportunity for clever and merry
choreography by the dance department. Neuwirth's "Hooloomooloo" made
an impressive noise and was impressively played, with an electronic
piano pulling the ensemble in and out of a specific pitch. David
Rosenboom conducted the three works securely and musically (although
the Cage wasn't ever steady). But this was two concerts, not one,
preventing Brant from getting his full due. However, with a new
concert hall and cathedral soon to open downtown, maybe this concert
can serve as wake-up call. Brant makes great buildings greater.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The WB's "Felicity" is back from a winter hiatus with a new episode
tonight at 9, but the return is a bittersweet one.</LD>
<LD>   Although the smart writing and sensitive portrayals that have made
the show such a pleasure to watch for much of the last four seasons
are still firmly in evidence, last month's news that the network was
pulling the plug on the drama hangs over the proceedings like the
death sentence that it is.</LD>
<LD>   One small consolation is that the series will be allowed go out
with a measure of dignity in a two-hour finale May 22. And it will
take every minute of those two hours to draw satisfactory conclusions
to the romantic entanglements and career yearnings of Felicity (the
still-luminous Keri Russell) and company.</LD>
<TE>   Many observers think the series lost its way when co-creator J.J.
Abrams left to work on ABC's "Alias." But it could also be that a
series tracing the lives of a group of likable college students from
freshmen to seniors has simply run its course after four years.</TE>
<TE>   The critically acclaimed show set a WB record when it premiered in
September 1998, drawing 7.1 million viewers. This season, it has
averaged 3.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if you tune in tonight, you'll see that "Felicity" still
works.</TE>
<TE>   The episode, "Future Shock," hits the ground running when Ben
(Scott Speedman) learns that there will be lingering consequences
from his one-night dalliance four months earlier with Lauren (Lisa
Edelstein).</TE>
<TE>   Yes, a baby is on the way, but Ben exhausts all avenues of denial
until there's nothing left to do but break the news to the woman he
really loves, namely that lucky gal Felicity.</TE>
<TE>   The other cast members are too consumed with their own personal
crises to take much notice, however.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be an interesting few weeks to the finish.</TE>

<LD>Prime time's version of March Madness has been a two-network race,
with CBS and NBC running neck-and-neck atop the ratings while ABC and
Fox remain out of the running and down in viewing compared to last
year, based on estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   CBS' coverage of the NCAA tournament got off to a reasonably good
start, and "Survivor: Marquesas" experienced few ill effects from its
temporary shift to Wednesdays to accommodate basketball. With
"Survivor" preceding it, "Amazing Race 2" also fared moderately well
but was no match for Fox's "Celebrity Boxing," which punched up the
network's highest Wednesday rating in nearly a year.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's new comedies "Watching Ellie" and "Leap of Faith,"
meanwhile, continue to lose viewers, though the latter benefited from
facing basketball--which skews heavily toward men--and retained 75%
of the audience that watched "Friends," the figure NBC is most
closely monitoring.</LD>
<TE>   Diane Sawyer's Rosie O'Donnell interview lifted "PrimeTime
Thursday" to a season high, ranking as the most-watched interview
since Gary Condit spoke to Connie Chung. NBC's "Law &amp; Order" also
continues to exhibit remarkable durability, recording the highest
rating for a rerun in over a decade.</TE>

<LD>The months-long awards season that reaches its climax Sunday with the
Oscars is a rich one for celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   After the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, presenters and
performers will carry home close to $6,000 worth of presents, and on
Sunday, each Academy Awards nominee and presenter will receive a gift
basket reportedly worth $20,000.</LD>
<LD>   Included in this year's Oscar gift basket are $500 worth of
skin-care products from Sonya Dakar, the fragrance JOY, valued at
$400, CJ &amp; Me handbags ranging from $160 to $245, and a gift
certificate for a "Zen-styled" $350 Gaiam Meditation Chair made from
"sustainably harvested, kiln-dried alder wood," according to the
company's press release.</LD>
<TE>   Good for relaxing after carrying home the loot.</TE>
<TE>   From the first contacts with companies providing the products
until the final ribbon is tied, it takes between four and six months
to assemble a gift basket, said Lash Fary, who with Jaimsyne Blakely
runs Distinctive Assets. Their company has created gift baskets for
more than two dozen award shows in three years, including the
Independent Spirit Awards and the Grammys.</TE>
<TE>   And Fary knows his celebrities, from dress sizes and favorite
colors to pet causes and pet peeves. For this year's Grammys, special
items included tableware for Gwen Stefani and, of course, specially
designed shades for Bono. Fary made sure that Grammy baskets for
Alicia Keys and India.Arie, didn't include the $1,900 platinum and
diamond earrings being given to other artists, as both have spoken
out against the diamond trade in the past, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The art is in the customizing, he added. "Let's face it, they can
buy whatever they want."</TE>
<TE>   The gift baskets are "cost-effective marketing" for the sponsoring
companies, he said. "There's so much value in saying 'Cher uses this
product, Bono has these glasses.'"</TE>
<TE>   Still, the politics of presents can be treacherous, Fary said.
"Some celebrities will ask, 'Why did Madonna get that and I didn't?'"</TE>
<TE>   Director's Life Enhances 'Kissing'</TE>
<TE>   A filmmaker's firsthand experience with his material doesn't
necessarily make for a better film, but "Kissing Jessica Stein"
director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld admits that it helps.</TE>
<TE>   At 21, Herman-Wurmfeld says, he fell in love with his best friend,
a man who ended the relationship six months later because he wasn't
gay.</TE>
<TE>   That traumatic experience gave him an advantage in directing
"Kissing Jessica Stein," which features a straight woman who falls in
love with a woman she meets through a personal ad.</TE>
<TE>   "Human sexuality is kind of like water," says Herman-Wurmfeld, 35,
speaking by cell phone from a subway platform in Manhattan. "It sort
of leaks out of places where it's unexpected or where it's not
supposed to be according to the culture at large."</TE>
<TE>   The film, co-written by its stars Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather
Juergensen, opened a week ago in limited release to favorable reviews
and solid earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the 1994 lesbian comedy "Go Fish," says Herman-Wurmfeld,
there is growing mainstream acceptance for gay romantic comedies.</TE>
<TE>   "Kissing Jessica Stein" "has a universal quality in that Jessica's
homophobia opens the door for people who are uncomfortable with the
subject matter," he says. The movie "creates a space where any person
regardless of their orientation could feel comfortable to experience
the story.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the film champions tolerance," he adds, "and creates an
opportunity for conversation and debate among people who ordinarily
wouldn't be considering it."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I want to die peacefully in my sleep like my grandfather did,"
said Joan Rivers by phone from New York, testing new material for an
April 5 stand-up performance at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, "and not
like the others in the car with him. I love that joke so much!"</TE>

<HD>Soho Crime Tales, Sordid to the End</HD>
<DH>Jake Arnott's characters don't waste time on redemption.
They're busy getting away with murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>There are no good guys in Jake Arnott's crime novels and not too much
of the good life either. Although set in the swinging '60s, an
electrifying time of pop music, mod fashion and British soccer
prowess, Arnott focuses on London's dark underbelly.</LD>
<LD>   In "The Long Firm" and his more recent "He Kills Coppers," the
British author creates a world of Soho gangsters and whores, of
killers, corrupt police and sleazy journalists bound together by sin.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, I do tend to think virtue is dependent on circumstances,"
Arnott said breezily. "Villains are a much easier way of looking at
humanity. Shakespeare constantly wrote about villains....The kind of
Catholic thing I grew up with, you know, man being in a fallen state,
makes sense to me. I think there are possibilities for redemption. I
don't necessarily include them in my books."</LD>
<TE>   Arnott laughs when he says this last bit, and it quickly becomes
apparent that he laughs easily. Perhaps this is to be expected after
the critical and financial success he has had with his two books in
Britain and the United States. London's Evening Standard called "The
Long Firm" "an immaculate debut"; the Sunday Times said Arnott has a
"gift for period detail and atmosphere"; and People magazine weighed
in, calling "Coppers" a "wicked delight."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Arnott's breezy manner is far more surprising than if he
had arrived at the Patisserie Valerie with a snub-nose revolver
tucked into his waistband. Instead, the 40-year-old Arnott showed up
with an undershirt peeking boyishly out of the collar of his
navy-blue shirt. His wide eyes, open face and spiky hair made him
look slightly startled, but hardly threatening.</TE>
<TE>   He is friendly and self-deprecating, even though he is something
of a grenade tosser, a myth breaker. Arnott, the kid who left school
at 16, quotes German author Bertolt Brecht, Italian intellectual
Antonio Gramsci and Alfred Hitchcock. He is a gay writer whose
homosexual characters may loathe being gay. His '60s mark the end of
the British Empire, not the beginning of pop culture. And his crime
novels do not have crimes to solve or tidy endings typical of the
genre.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really a genre writer. There is a kind of neatness and
mathematics to crime fiction, and I don't have the precision for the
way you get a sort of resolution, even though in most crime books
there is quite a bit of ambivalence in the central character.
Certainly with Dashiell Hammett, who is a big influence on me, his
hero is always incredibly subverted by all sorts of things," Arnott
said.</TE>
<TE>   In his own books, Arnott said, "There's nothing to be solved in
terms of individual guilt. It's much more the social aspects that I'm
interested in. It's not so much a whodunit as a wedunit."</TE>
<TE>   "He Kills Coppers" is a fictionalized account of the killing of
three London police officers in 1966, during the summer of England's
World Cup victory. The gunman, Harry Roberts, became a folk hero to
anarchists and working-class mobs who turned his name into an
antipolice chant with the refrain "He kills coppers," from which the
book title is taken.</TE>
<TE>   Arnott writes in sawed-off English, in clipped sentences fired
like bullets at the readers' imagination. His shooter is Billy
Porter, a former soldier who learned jungle warfare during the 1950s
in Malaya, now known as Malaysia. Back in civilian life, Porter is a
small-time crook out to commit a crime with two hapless cohorts when
the police stop their van. Rather than be caught with an illegal
weapon, Porter does the only thing it seems he has ever done well: He
shoots. Three policemen die and Porter goes on the run for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   His story is entwined with two others: that of Det. Sgt. Frank
Taylor, a friend of one of the dead officers, who is reluctantly
drawn into a world of graft while pursuing the killer; and journalist
Tony Meehan, a self-hating gay who covers the shooting for the Sunday
Illustrated tabloid and eventually commits murder himself.</TE>
<TE>   Obsessed with Porter's crime and escape from justice, Meehan says,
"He was out there somewhere, at large, a killer on the run. My killer
was still trapped inside of me."</TE>
<TE>   That is about as close as an Arnott character gets to
self-reflection. They are busy doing, not thinking. Busy getting away
with murder.</TE>
<TE>   "It's how I see the world. I am getting my characters to do a lot.
They don't have much time to sit and think about things. They don't
try to analyze," Arnott said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like [American writer] William Burroughs once said to [the
poet] Allen Ginsberg, 'Remember, Allen, human is an adjective, not a
noun.'"</TE>
<TE>   Conversation with Arnott produces a stream of ideas on British
society, writing and, inevitably, gays. The central character in his
first book, "The Long Firm," is Harry Starks, a homosexual gangster
in the mold of one of Britain's renowned gangland twins, Ronnie Kray.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, the fact that Ronnie Kray was homosexual
was very important to me," Arnott said. He was not exactly a role
model, but an example of a confident homosexual. And, unlike the
journalist Meehan, the tough guy Starks is comfortable with his
homosexuality. He's a racketeer and a victimizer, but certainly not a
victim.</TE>
<TE>   "That is something I was determined to do in the first book. He's
not a martyr. So many gay literary figures are martyrs, good people
and something awful has happened to them, or they're dying of a
dreadful disease, they're sad, dramatic lonely queens or whatever. I
was determined that I wanted to write a gay character who wasn't a
victim, wasn't even gay necessarily, who had no interest in having to
justify himself in any way other than the fact that he liked boys,"
Arnott said.</TE>
<TE>   Arnott grew up in a middle-class family in Buckinghamshire with a
house full of novels that his father read on the train to and from
London each day. Arnott consumed them with pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   He left home for a series of seedy London flats where he brushed
up against the kind of anarchists he impales in "He Kills Coppers."
He undertook odd jobs after leaving school, including stints as a
mortuary technician and an artist's life model, eventually turning to
writing.</TE>
<TE>   Arnott wrote for years before settling on the idea of a gangster
book after Ronnie Kray died in 1995. He sent off the manuscript of
"The Long Firm," landed a six-figure contract and became an overnight
literary success in Britain after the book's release in 1999. As a
result, aspiring writers constantly probe him for his secrets.</TE>
<TE>   "People will ask about one's writing regime. All of that is
irrelevant. You don't have some sort of formula. I think writers
often lie about that, anyway. Graham Greene always used to say that
he wrote 300 words a day and would stop mid-sentence when he got
there. And I thought, 'Yeah, that's a great line and everyone
remembers it and some people believed it.' But it meant nobody had to
ask him that question again," Arnott said.</TE>
<TE>   He insists he does love writing, although sometimes that is the
last and most difficult step in the making of a book.</TE>
<TE>   "Hitchcock said the most boring part of the filming process was
when he actually filmed, because he'd imagined it all. Every single
shot, he knew what he was going to do. That's how I felt sometimes.
You get these incredible bursts of a great idea, often when you're
walking down the street or something, and you write it. And when you
finally finesse it, you're already tired with this idea."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Arnott has new ideas. He's working on a third crime
novel in what has inadvertently become a trilogy.</TE>

<LD>Generally, a little economic chaos is good for a family. It keeps you
from focusing on each other's various personal shortcomings and keeps
the eye always on the prize. The mortgage payment at the end of the
month. A college education.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, tonight I've got bunco," my wife tells me at breakfast.</LD>
<LD>   "Again?" I ask.</LD>
<TE>   Remember how men used to get together for poker? Now the wives are
getting together for these bunco games, where they gather in
someone's home to gamble a little, guzzle wine and joke about their
sex lives. At least that's what the husbands assume they're doing.
There could be more to bunco, but I doubt it.</TE>
<TE>   The wives could be using these meetings to plot to take over the
White House or reorganize the U.N. They could be talking Fed policy.</TE>
<TE>   Or, generous as they are, these bunco girls could be figuring out
how to make their husbands happier and more fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   They could be planning lavish weekends away with their husbands to
reward us for taking a greater role in raising the kids. For all the
little things we do that our dads didn't. The dishes. The diapers.
Algebra.</TE>
<TE>   But I doubt it.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Mom?" the little girl asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Bunco," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's going to help me with my homework?"</TE>
<TE>   "Call your sister," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Women. For a while, they had us thinking they were better than us,
more dedicated and reliable, some of them, in fact, quite perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Now we're learning that women have their weaknesses, too.</TE>
<TE>   They're quick to make fun of us with our Final Four brackets, yet
they're all googly-eyed over those silly Oscar ballots.</TE>
<TE>   They used to scold us over poker nights. Now they have this bunco,
which apparently is a simple dice game where you rotate from table to
table, wine sloshing everywhere, money exchanging hands. Laughter.
Camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the evening, the winner leaves with enough cash for
a decent pair of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   As they gamble these nights away, dark clouds gather over our once
proud land. Dishes pile up. Homework, too. The republic may never
recover.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, most everyone has a headache.</TE>
<TE>   "What time did you get home?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   "Just curious."</TE>
<TE>   "Eleven," she says, stirring her coffee, looking into it for
answers.</TE>
<TE>   "On a school night?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, on a school night," says bunco girl.</TE>
<TE>   March is the money month. Everywhere you look there's some school
fund-raiser or a half-dozen silent auctions. At the spring fair, a
silent auction. At the PTA dinner, yet another.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, all transactions will be made through silent auctions.
Need a new car? Sign that list over there. Going to Greece? Try to
outbid Bob and Lynda.</TE>
<TE>   You readers turn to this space every week to find out what's
really going on in America, and I'm here to tell you that if these
silent auctions don't ruin us as a nation, bunco will.</TE>
<TE>   "I never knew Charlotte was so much fun," my wife says, recalling
some bunco pal.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't know," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Beware these Ides of March. The tax man cometh. Bunco is sweeping
the land. There are all those silent auctions. Even those Nixon girls
are haggling over money. Secret bunco junkies, probably.</TE>
<TE>   Then last week, the Girl Scout cookie cash comes due. As always,
we are short about 60 bucks.</TE>
<TE>   What happens, usually, is that the Girl Scout cookie money comes
in, and we tap into the envelope for emergency cash for school or
dinner then wind up writing a check to cover the difference.</TE>
<TE>   It's check-kiting at its worst, the kind of monetary policy
favored by Third World dictators. Orange County once invested this
way. Enron, too.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope," I warn my wife, "that you didn't use Girl Scout money
for bunco."</TE>
<TE>   "Mighta," she says without remorse.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, there's a reason those Thin Mints look like poker
chips. One day, they may replace cash.</TE>
<TE>   "At school, guess who's winning their NCAA bracket?" the boy asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Your mom?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Oh mother, where art thou? How come all of a sudden I feel like
Hamlet?</TE>
<TE>   "Talked to the tax guy today," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "And?"</TE>
<TE>   "He says tennis lessons count as day care," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "In Brazil?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, here," she says.</TE>

<HD>A Good Soldier, a Devoted Doctor</HD>
<DH>Rob Marsh survived Somalia and Gulf War to become a
physician committed to his rural patients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL MORELLO</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>MIDDLEBROOK, Va.</DL>
<LD>The only doctor in this crossroads of a Shenandoah Valley village
does not volunteer details of his years with an elite Army unit, or
how he almost died in Somalia of mortar wounds. And his patients are
too polite to probe.</LD>
<LD>   But while waiting in the clinic to see Rob Marsh, many of them
study the watercolor prints on the walls, depicting soldiers
rappelling into battle and downed Black Hawk helicopters. How, they
wonder, did this decorated combat physician come to treat the aches
and pains of farmers and factory workers in the valley?</LD>
<LD>   "They remind me every day where I came from, and why I'm here,"
explains Marsh while driving over gravel roads and one-lane bridges
in his pickup truck. He's making house calls. And he won't send a
bill. It's not very efficient, he allows, but this is what a good
country doctor does.</LD>
<TE>   They didn't have a doctor before Marsh moved here six years ago
with his wife, Barbara, and their children--now two boys and two
girls, ages 3 to 9. "I feel that's why I was saved, to come back here
and do this," he says. "This is my calling."</TE>
<TE>   Marsh practices medicine with a care and attention that seem lost
to another era. How many doctors are left whose patients drop by just
to leave a home-baked cake or to show off photographs of the animals
they've raised in 4-H?</TE>
<TE>   Marsh's practice in a University of Virginia satellite clinic is
all the more extraordinary when contrasted with the life he once led
as a flight surgeon for Delta Force, the Army's secretive Special
Forces unit.</TE>
<TE>   His office is filled with mementos of war zones where he mended
wounds and lost friends. A bookshelf holds the iconic Delta Force
dagger inside a triangular frame, along with the motto "Oppressors
Beware." In two examining rooms, drawings of Delta Force battles
share wall space with osteoporosis posters. His Legion of Merit, two
Bronze Stars and Purple Heart are stashed at home and in his truck.</TE>
<TE>   What's missing is anything that smacks of the Hollywood version of
what happened to Delta Force and Ranger troops in Mogadishu, Somalia,
in October 1993. Marsh has not seen the blockbuster film "Black Hawk
Down."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to go watch a re-enactment of seeing 18 of my
friends die," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did he consent when producers asked him to be a consultant. "I
couldn't leave my patients," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Marsh, 46, had wanted to be a Green Beret since a third-grade
visit to Fort Bragg with his father, John Marsh Jr., then a
Democratic congressman from the Shenandoah Valley, who later became
secretary of the Army under presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
The son is John Marsh III, but everyone knows him as Rob.</TE>
<TE>   The quickest route into the Green Berets was as a medic, so Marsh
enlisted and eventually received a degree from Eastern Virginia
Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   He had his share of close calls. During the Persian Gulf War in
1991, a medic who replaced him on a helicopter flight into Iraq was
killed when the chopper crashed.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing compared to his experience in Somalia two years later.
U.S. troops set out to capture two aides to a local warlord. Army
Rangers and Delta Force operatives became pinned down during a night
of pitched combat.</TE>
<TE>   The casualties arrived at the airport base in waves. First a
handful, then by the dozens--some 60 serious casualties in all. Marsh
and two other physicians worked through the night and into the next
day.</TE>
<TE>   For Marsh, the worst was yet to come. Two days later, he was
standing on the tarmac with other officers when a mortar hit. The man
next to him was killed. Twelve soldiers were wounded, including
Marsh. Here is what he remembers before losing consciousness: "A
flash. Noise. I remember feeling pain."</TE>
<TE>   Shrapnel shredded his abdomen. A shard pierced an artery in his
leg. Yet even as he lay bleeding, he ordered soldiers to carry the
injured to his side so he could perform triage. "They were my people.
I wanted to know who was hit."</TE>
<TE>   Even before his injury, Marsh had talked of returning to the
valley, which he always considered home, though he was largely
educated in Arlington, Va., public schools.</TE>
<TE>   The university's health system was looking to open a rural office
in this area to show medical students the life of a country doctor--a
breed that has largely vanished during the last 50 years as
physicians have gravitated to specialties and urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Rural areas can be hard on the family," says Claudette Dalton, an
anesthesiologist who heads the university's community education
program. "There are no cultural attractions. You have to drive 10
miles to the Piggly Wiggly to get groceries."</TE>
<TE>   Marsh saw it differently.</TE>
<TE>   "He goes where the need is greatest," says Dalton. "There aren't
many physicians who will take on all comers as patients."</TE>
<TE>   One day recently, Marsh spent the afternoon crisscrossing the back
roads of this cattle-raising area. He made half a dozen house calls,
most to elderly, housebound patients. Testing the memory of a stroke
victim, he asked her how many chickens her daughter owns. At the home
of a cancer patient struggling to pay for his arsenal of medicine,
Marsh left a supply of salesman's samples.</TE>
<TE>   He would not ask for payment.</TE>
<TE>   "If I sent them a bill for $150 for a house visit, they would
pay," he explains. "But I probably wouldn't keep them as a patient."</TE>
<TE>   They are not just his patients, he says, but "my friends."</TE>
<TE>   That's why he attends their funerals, serves on their volunteer
fire and rescue unit, makes apple butter with the Ruritan Club, a
community service group, and is an elder in his church. "You can
become very close to everyone, very quickly," he says of this hamlet
of 200. "If you're a good doctor, you treat people right and get
involved in the community."</TE>
<TE>   It's a philosophy he's passing on to the coming generation of
doctors. "He believes we should make sure we give more to our
community than just medicine," says Frank Petruzella, a University of
Virginia medical student who spent a month working with Marsh. "He's
very involved in all aspects of people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Marsh has been involved in Carl Sprouse's life for a decade. They
were in Delta Force together, and Sprouse lives down the road. "When
my father had complications after open-heart surgery, Doc Marsh would
stop by at 11 or 12 at night to see him in the hospital," recalls
Sprouse. "He wasn't his doctor. He just has compassion for people. He
was a good soldier. He's a great man."</TE>
<TE>   Marsh deflects such praise. In this small farming community he has
rediscovered what he loved most about Delta Force. "It's the same
atmosphere," he says. "Everybody takes care of each other, and we do
our jobs."</TE>

<HD>The Profit Quest as Journalism's Bad News</HD>
<DH>Media* Two Washington Post editors argue that standards
have fallen amid owners' pursuit of gain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LES GURA</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An insatiable quest for unreasonably high profits has been slowly
sinking the media for years, Washington Post editors Leonard Downie
Jr. and Robert G. Kaiser argue in their new book, "The News About the
News: American Journalism in Peril" (Knopf).</LD>
<LD>   In chapter after chapter, they detail how pursuit of the dollar
and fealty to corporate investors has ownership chain after ownership
chain--in print and broadcast journalism--lowering standards. The
result has hurt credibility and reduced the chances of doing great
work, the authors say, citing reductions of staff and space at print
chains such as Knight Ridder and Gannett, the latter a favorite
target.</LD>
<LD>   For all the media's woes, however, Downie and Kaiser see an
underlying message of hope. For example, they say the events of Sept.
11 could be a potential salvation if newspapers and broadcast outlets
choose to use the public's reawakened interest in news as an impetus
for change.</LD>
<TE>   In a telephone interview, Kaiser said the mixed message of their
book partly reflects Downie's glass-half-empty and his own
glass-half-full point of view. Both Kaiser, now an associate editor
and senior correspondent, and Downie, the newspaper's executive
editor, have been with the Post since the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many lousy papers with great results, and no great
papers with lousy results," Kaiser said. "My hopefulness is rooted in
the thought that, sooner or later, the fact that quality pays and
mediocrity doesn't will catch up with the newsroom manager.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be a pipe dream," he adds in the same breath.</TE>
<TE>   "The News About the News" is a fast-paced book, its 266 pages
written simply and directly, as you would expect from two veteran
editors.</TE>
<TE>   It begins with a quick history of news in the United States,
running right through the events of Sept. 11, which, the authors
note, led the public to buy many more newspapers and watch television
news in record numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The authors follow with detailed breakdowns of successful
investigations, by the New York Times on the Church of Scientology
and by the Post on the high number of fatal shootings by Washington
police. They then bring readers through a compelling review of how
the Post decided against publishing a story during the 1996
presidential campaign that would have revealed an affair Republican
Bob Dole had 30 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   These stories are intended to show the depth of work and critical
decision-making made by the best news organizations. They establish a
baseline from which they then compare other newspapers and the
broadcast world. The chapters that follow portray the sad state of
affairs at most major companies not named the Times or Post. In fact,
they say newspapers largely operated under a siege mentality in the
'80s and '90s, owing to the need to satisfy shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "The proprietors who experimented with the journalistic fashions
of the '90s," they write, "usually avoided one obvious avenue to
improvement: spending more money on covering the news."</TE>
<TE>   The examination of the problems of the print world is followed by
an enlightening chapter in which Downie and Kaiser coaxed all three
network television news anchors--Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter
Jennings--to discuss, by comparing 20-year-old news broadcasts with
current ones, the state of their industry.</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw and Jennings remain optimistic about the changes in network
news and focus on more people- and consumer-oriented stories. Rather
is far more pessimistic, railing against the cost-cutting that
drastically slashed the number of foreign correspondents and coverage
of world news in favor of more lifestyle stories.</TE>
<TE>   The authors see some good coming out of the growing use of Web
sites--more people, they say, are willing to turn to the Internet
when news is breaking, which will force broadcasters to work harder
on those stories.</TE>
<TE>   As technology continues to march forward, Downie and Kaiser say
the leaders of news organizations must recognize that the public
wants quality as much as razzle-dazzle. "Our hope is that the
industry would begin to understand the huge asset they have and the
proper way of caring for it," Kaiser said.</TE>

<HD>Can't We Rethink the Freeways We Have?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Why do candidates in this town run for office on any issue other
than traffic?" my husband asked above the roar of the 134.</LD>
<LD>   "What candidates?" I asked. "Mayoral? Gubernatorial? City Council?
Presidential?"</LD>
<LD>   "Any of them," he said, nosing into the exit lane. "Someone makes
fixing traffic their absolute priority and they would rule this
state."</LD>
<TE>   His comment was not exactly a non sequitur. We were heading into
Hollywood from Glendale, and to do this by freeway, one must take the
134 west, get on the 170 then get off immediately and double back on
what then becomes the 101 south--there is no other way to get on the
101 south from the 134. This is, of course, insane. Almost as insane
as the fact that to get on the 405 south from the 101, one must enter
a single, perilously narrow lane that hairpins from one freeway to
another--the other day I was part of a mile-long line of fuming
traffic creeping behind an SUV whose driver obviously thought that at
any speed greater than 10 mph, the thing would flip.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just a few miles along one thoroughfare. Throughout Los
Angeles, city and county, there are innumerable sites of gridlock,
danger and just plain freeway weirdness, most of which is so easily
correctable to the benefit of all. When, for example, will "they"
ever fix the narrow onramp from the 110 north to the 101 north that
jams traffic through the city practically 24/7? Maybe when some group
stages a protest by walking on car roofs from 9th Street to Silver
Lake Boulevard? Or how about the hard left one must make to merge
from the 110 north to the 5? Or the inexplicable narrowing of the 5
to one lane that occurs in both directions just south of the 10?
People I know go miles out of their way to avoid that bottleneck,
thereby taking up rush-hour space on freeways that, technically, they
shouldn't even be on.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who runs for any office in this city, county and state
knows that public condemnation of the state of L.A. traffic is
mandatory, and for years we've heard about expanding "light rail" and
bus corridors throughout Southern California, and about
computer-aided "smart" freeways that are in the works. Meanwhile,
riders have to sue the MTA to try to get a few more buses on the
road, and we have a light rail line that ends just far enough away
from the airport to prevent it from actually being functional in any
meaningful way.</TE>
<TE>   Of course we need more and better mass transit. Of course we
should use whatever technology is available to make freeways smarter,
trains faster, buses cleaner. But there are a lot of obstacles to
such plans--financial, political and cultural. Everyone in L.A. wants
more mass transit options, but no one wants the new
tracks/construction/bus lanes in their neighborhood. Everyone in L.A.
wants less traffic, but very few are willing to carpool.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, perhaps politicos should start smaller. Maybe someone
should run for something on the platform that he or she will make the
freeways that we have more sensible. Not fancier or smarter or even
more numerous. Just more sensible. Exit ramps that are two lanes, and
do not require centrifugal force to survive; freeways that do not
narrow suddenly and are actually connected to those that intersect
them. You know, the little things.</TE>

<LD>Do you know that many commercial products have tiny 1-800 phone
numbers on the packages for "comments" or "questions"? Sure you do,
because I disclosed this fact precisely one year and one week ago,
when I made embarrassingly immature calls to customer service
representatives. I have been permitted to revisit this format, now
that we've passed the statute of limitations for libel suits.</LD>
<LD>   * Duracell Batteries</LD>
<LD>   Me: How many Duracell D batteries would it take to power a cattle
prod capable of delivering a major teeth-shattering jolt to, say, a
telemarketer?</LD>
<TE>   Cecile: I don't know. It would take a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Me: How many?</TE>
<TE>   Cecile: I've never checked into it.</TE>
<TE>   Me: So you don't have a precise number?</TE>
<TE>   Cecile: You are kidding, right?</TE>
<TE>   Me: No.</TE>
<TE>   Cecile: I have to go now.</TE>
<TE>   * Vicks NyQuil</TE>
<TE>   Me: I noticed that unlike regular NyQuil, there is no alcohol in
children's NyQuil. Speaking as a devoted and highly satisfied
customer of regular NyQuil, my question is, is this fair to the kids?</TE>
<TE>   Aaron: Actually, the alcohol is not a therapeutic ingredient in
NyQuil. It's just a solvent; the other ingredients dissolve in it. In
the children's NyQuil, we just use a different solvent.</TE>
<TE>   Me: Well, why don't you use that other solvent in adult NyQuil?</TE>
<TE>   (Long pause.)</TE>
<TE>   Aaron: You know, I don't know the answer to that.</TE>
<TE>   Me: I do.</TE>
<TE>   * Tampax Tampons</TE>
<TE>   Me: Speaking for American men, I wonder if Tampax would consider
advising stores to better hide its products, you know, like in a safe
in the manager's office, so men don't stumble across them
accidentally when they're unprepared, and get the heebie-jeebies.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren: Well, I can share your suggestion with the company. But I
don't know that would be good for the sales of the product.</TE>
<TE>   Me: You see my problem, though?</TE>
<TE>   Lauren: Actually, yes. My husband doesn't like it at all, either.
He tends to move quickly through those aisles.</TE>
<TE>   Me: So what is your advice?</TE>
<TE>   Lauren: If it gives you the willies, just turn away and get out of
the area. Vacate the area.</TE>
<TE>   Me: In case this fails, does Procter &amp; Gamble offer any products
for the willies or the heebie-jeebies?</TE>
<TE>   Lauren: If it makes you feel bad to the point of nausea, we have
Pepto-Bismol.</TE>
<TE>   * Grecian Formula</TE>
<TE>   Me: I couldn't help noticing that your package features a photo of
a ruggedly handsome 35-year-old man who basically looks like Tom
Cruise. And I was just wondering why you didn't have a guy who looks
more like the typical consumer of this product, someone like Dennis
Hastert or Yogi Berra. Is this deceptive advertising?</TE>
<TE>   Jim: I'll be honest with you. People view hair color in a very
aspirational way. People don't like to look at ugly people. Our
models are people out of the Actors' Equity community.</TE>
<TE>   Me: Would you be interested in employing me as a model for your
package? My hair looks like a teddy bear recovered from the scene of
an airplane crash.</TE>
<TE>   Jim: In all honesty, if you have gray hair and you're ugly, and
you color that gray hair, you're still gonna be ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Me: Wow.</TE>
<TE>   Jim: I'm just being honest.</TE>

<TE>   Me: I see that you say you can lose up to 10 pounds in two days by
drinking this juice, but when you read the fine print, it tells you
not to consume food or alcohol during the two days. Is that right?</TE>
<TE>   Kim: Correct.</TE>

<LD>Every week, about 2,500 pounds of fresh carrots are delivered to the
Los Angeles Zoo for the animals. The zoo's chimpanzees, elephants,
giraffes and gorillas enjoy eating these orange roots.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the animals get their carrots whole, while others get them
in bite-size pieces. The zoo's four elephants are the biggest
consumers. They eat about 175 pounds of carrots every day, stems and
all.</LD>
<LD>   If you like eating carrots or just enjoy gardening, you can grow
your own carrots at home with a few items found around the house or
at the nursery.</LD>
<TE>   What you need: Small red-clay pot or plastic cup; one cup of
potting soil; a package of little finger carrot seeds; water and
sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Fill your clay pot or plastic cup three-quarters full with
potting soil.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Poke your index finger into the soil in three or four
different places.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3:  Drop a carrot seed into each hole.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Cover the holes with soil. Add some water and place your
plant in an area with sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Water the carrot plants regularly. Carrots get to be about
3 inches long after two months. These gourmet carrots are very sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Visit the L.A. Zoo during Big Bunny's Spring Fling from March 29
to 31, and you can plant little finger carrots to take home. There
also will be live rabbits to pet, bunny face painting and rabbit ears
to color and wear. Children's musical groups will offer fun
entertainment for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget to have your picture taken with Big Bunny. Learn more
about the zoo and Big Bunny's Spring Fling by visiting www.lazoo.org.</TE>

<DH>Fans rally to save an offbeat museum of antique devices
that has attracted Bay Area tourists for nearly four decades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Weirdly but ceaselessly, for nearly four decades, Ed Zelinsky's
antique mechanical sideshow has ticked along in a rundown room on the
seaward side of the Cliff House. Maybe you've seen it and thought it
was a dream.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe you once visited the famed tourist-trap restaurant at the
ocean's edge and wandered into the white, cold fog behind it. And
maybe a huge, scary, laughing clown suddenly materialized from a
misted doorway. Then you would have heard Zelinsky's Seeburg Style K
Nickelodeon wheezing--the "Skater's Waltz," maybe--and seen the rows
of rickety, coin-operated peep shows and found yourself peering into
the gypsy fortuneteller's mechanical face.</LD>
<LD>   If so, you weren't as alone as you probably felt at that moment.
In the past couple of weeks, thousands of San Franciscans have come
forward to share their attachment to Zelinsky's bizarre, beloved
Musee Mecanique.</LD>
<TE>   Since word leaked that a planned renovation of the Cliff House
would force the collection from its crumbling quarters, a minor
blizzard of letters, e-mail and petitions has swirled about the city.
Public hearings have convened. Editorials have circulated. The other
day, a DJ on the rock radio station KFOG-FM ranted on the air about
it and 100 soul-patched, combat-booted listeners showed up at the
doorway with fists full of quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten thousands of calls--thousands," marveled San
Francisco County Supervisor Jake McGoldrick. "You wonder what taps
into people. Believe me, you want to put up 500 units of affordable
housing in this city, you don't get thousands of calls. You want to
improve the transit system, you don't get thousands of calls. You
say, 'Hey, how 'bout helping us out with the homeless,' people go,
'Ahh, get outta here, we're sick of the homeless.'</TE>
<TE>   "But this just seems to have touched something in people.
Nostalgia seems almost too superficial a word for it. People just
have these wonderful memories."</TE>
<TE>   The Musee's situation has actually developed over some years. The
three-story Cliff House, now in its third incarnation, is not only
notoriously seedy but seismically unsafe. The National Park Service,
which owns the land, plans to tear down the restaurant and gift shop
in September and rebuild the complex to look as it did in 1909, when
it was a low-slung roadhouse. The new restaurant has no room for the
Musee.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Weideman, spokesman for the service's Golden Gate
Recreational Area, says the plans call for the Musee to be moved
eventually into a new visitor's center up the hill from the
restaurant. The rebuilt quarters, however, won't be completed for at
least two years, and possibly longer--the project is now only in the
feasibility phase and the Park Service is hoping to finance it, at
least in part, with private donations.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zelinsky, the 80-year-old collector who owns the Musee,
says he barely breaks even on the arcade, the rules for such
renovations leave private, for-profit businesses to find their own
homes in the interim.</TE>
<TE>   Zelinsky, a dapper painting contractor and real estate investor
who claims to be a fifth-generation San Franciscan, says he started
his collection when he was 7 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "I had gone to a matinee on Fillmore Street at the Princess
Theater and they had a drawing at intermission," he remembered. "To
my amazement, they called my name, and I won the grand prize--five
quarts of motor oil!</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I sold the motor oil to my piano teacher for 75 cents, and
with that money, I went down to Golden Gate Avenue, a section of the
city that, at that time, sold slot machines and jukeboxes. And I
bought myself a penny machine that you got five balls for a penny and
you tried to get the balls into the target. And after a while, my
friends wanted to play it, and when I had collected enough pennies
from them, I went out and bought another machine."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Zelinsky--whose penny machines now mostly cost a
quarter--has what is believed to be one of the world's largest
collections of two-bit arcade antiques. Lined up in the Cliff House
back room are rows and rows of player pianos and Mutoscopes and
gear-operated gizmos that test your sex appeal and strength and give
little peep shows and tell fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   "Play Golf! See How Good You Are!" the machines say. And: "See
What The Belly Dancer Does On Her Day Off!" And: "Opium Den!" And:
"Real Motion Pictures featuring HAROLD LLOYD in 'ON THE BEAM'!"</TE>
<TE>   All are generations old, and still--miraculously--in full
operation, thanks to Zelinsky's son, Dan, who maintains the
collection, along with some vintage video games such as Ms. Pac Man.
In the doorway stands Laughing Sal, a huge, mechanical, straw-hatted
clown with a creepy, incessant guffaw. The lurid hobo had once
guarded the door to the Fun House at Playland-at-the-Beach, an
amusement park that spread out near the Cliff House and was torn down
in the early 1970s. Zelinsky bought the clown, which, as of last
week, was still evoking strong memories and terrifying small
children.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you kidding? I grew up with Laughing Sal," said Sean Scallan,
39, who had come by the Musee on a recent Friday to pay his respects
with his ashen-faced, 4-year-old daughter. "We used to live down on
44th and Balboa and you could hear her laughing at our house, six
blocks away."</TE>
<TE>   Only about half of the 300 machines in Zelinsky's collection are
in the Musee. The rest are in storage. But Zelinsky says it's
use-it-or-lose-it for those now on display. The oldest--a century-old
tableau that shows a "Message from the Sea" being delivered to a
general at a ball--has hand-carved wooden gears and leather pulleys
that make the partygoers dance and rock the boat of the messenger.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem," Zelinsky said, "is that you can't put these
machines into storage for that long. They'll fall apart on you."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he says, the profits from tourists defray the high cost
of maintaining the machinery. Thus, the new home cannot be in just
any location; it must be in a clean, large space with lots of
tourists, particularly the seniors who pump the most quarters into
the older games.</TE>
<TE>   So the search for a temporary home is on. So far, Zelinsky said,
three private property owners have offered buildings. The city and
park service are also looking into vacancies on their properties. A
supervisorial committee held a fact-finding hearing this month and
has ordered city staff to report back in May on options for keeping
the Musee open. "We haven't identified a place yet, but I'm
optimistic," Zelinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   And in the meantime, the place is besieged as never before by
visitors with cameras--not tourists, but locals bent on preserving
their memories. Not every city would hold such esteem for its inner
carny, but then, not every city is San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after they restore it, it won't be the same," said
50-year-old Patty Warren, who was wandering the Musee on a recent
lunch hour with a camcorder. "It'll just be encased in amber, in yet
another layer of self-consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, look around. Such a wonderful reliquary! Just so magical
and wistful and funky!" She lifted her camera to pan the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Great, blistered ribbons of lead paint unfurled from them. A band
of albino monkeys tooted mechanical trumpets, but the tune was
obscured by the nickelodeon, which was huffing "After You're Gone."</TE>

<HD>Real-World Lessons During Spring Break</HD>
<DH>College students get an education while spending their
vacation volunteering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SYLVIA MORENO</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A year ago, Melissa Drouin lay on Cancun's white sand beach, the
crystalline Caribbean lapping at her toes, an unlimited supply of
tropical drinks at her fingertips.</LD>
<LD>   It was spring break, and with thousands of other U.S. college
students, Drouin was at a beautiful Mexican seaside resort with
nothing much to do except sleep, swim, drink and dance till dawn.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Maine junior was back on spring break this week,
but this time at a nursing home in Washington, D.C. Whether the days
were gray, cold and drizzly or sunny, balmy and bright, she and 10
other students from Maine were tied to a schedule, volunteering at
the home from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. for five days.</LD>
<TE>   They slept in a youth hostel downtown, where they shared cooking
duties. They all had signed a "chem-free" pledge--violators to be
sent home at their own expense. Each had pitched in $75 in addition
to raising the money to pay for this break.</TE>
<TE>   They're part of a nationwide trend called "alternative spring
break," an idea born at Vanderbilt University in 1991 to promote
service and heighten social awareness among college students.</TE>
<TE>   The national program, Break Away, now has chapters at 62 colleges.
More than 5,000 students are participating at 300 locations this
year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   By the middle of her second day at the Washington Home, Drouin
knew it was all worthwhile, she said.</TE>
<TE>   There, in the middle of the lounge in the special care unit--where
those afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia
live--danced the woman that Drouin had spent hours with that morning.
In a whisper-soft voice, the woman had fretted about some vague
discomfort, which Drouin tried to ease with soothing words and some
water in a plastic cup.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation of the thin, stooped woman was disjointed and
difficult to follow. But now she was swaying in the arms of her
husband, who had come to visit. Drouin and another student were
playing "Strangers in the Night" on a boombox, planning to dance with
residents as part of music therapy.</TE>
<TE>   But Drouin had to leave the room.</TE>
<TE>   "She had her head on his shoulder, and they were slow-dancing to
Frank Sinatra. And you know that ball you get in your chest? I had to
leave. I had tears going down my face," said Drouin, a nursing major.
"I'm sure she's not the same person he's known all his life, but you
could see in his face how important it was to him to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Maine students arrived, students from the University of
Michigan and the University of Florida also spent their spring breaks
at the Washington Home.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes such a difference with what we can do for our
residents," said Lauren Feeney, the home's volunteer coordinator.
"People are saying they wish they had [the volunteers] all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The week clinched Kristy Townsend's decision to apply for a
neuroscience doctoral program.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old senior, who is majoring in biochemistry, now wants
to do research on Alzheimer's. But for many of her peers, who take
their mental acuity, good health and physical independence for
granted, the week wasn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   Misty Smith, 22, a senior psychology major, decided that working
with the elderly isn't for her. "I feel drained after five minutes,"
she said. "I see them at a point where they need assistance, and it's
hard to see that without wanting to do something about it--and I
can't."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Dunn, 19, also was brought to tears on his second day.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just overcome by the fact that someone this smart is left
completely dependent on others," Dunn said of a resident he talked
with. "I don't want to think how I would be in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Five other groups from the university took the alternative spring
break, volunteering with terminally ill children in Florida, an AIDS
hospice in New Orleans, a home for troubled boys in South Carolina, a
children's literacy program in Atlanta and the Gay Men's Health
Crisis Center in New York City. This was the fifth year the
university has participated in the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel it's important that our students do this. Some of the
students from Maine haven't even been exposed to some of these kinds
of environments, and besides, we just think that doing service for
the community is important," said Mary Skaggs, director of the
university's student employment and volunteer programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just all about school."</TE>

<LD>After the students in Room 120 told Mr. Dawkins, the principal, that
they didn't want Mr. Thomas as their substitute teacher anymore, he
crossed the lunchroom to talk to Mr. Thomas. First Mr. Dawkins said a
few words to the giant man. Then Mr. Thomas, who was looking down at
Mr. Dawkins, folded his arms over his chest.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, no!" Cherie Fontaine yelled. "Mr. Thomas is so mad he looks
like the giant from 'Jack and the Beanstalk.' He'll probably chase
the principal through the lunchroom saying 'fee fie foe fum!'"</LD>
<LD>   "No," Robin Chang said. "He looks like a giant Paul Bunyan. He'll
probably chop Mr. Dawkins down like a tree."</LD>
<TE>   Mr. Thomas pointed toward the door, and both men went outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Thomas is going to hurt the principal," Cherie said. "And
it's all our fault!" Every one of the children from Room 120 ran over
to the windows to watch what was happening outside. But a lunchroom
monitor sent them all back to their seats.</TE>
<TE>   The children sat nervously in their chairs until Mr. Thomas, the
giant of a substitute, walked back into the lunchroom. He was alone.
When he came over to his students, his arms were still crossed and he
wore three deep angry creases on his forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Lopez, the shortest kid in class, looked up at him and
asked, "Is Mr. Dawkins OK?"</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Thomas looked way down at her and said, "Sure. He's OK."</TE>
<TE>   "But he didn't say it like he meant it," Maria whispered.</TE>
<TE>   Then the bell rang. Mr. Thomas rubbed his hands together as if he
was getting ready for a fight. "OK. You heard the bell, didn't you?
Let's go!" The whole class ran behind Mr. Thomas to Room 120, trying
to keep up with his long strides.</TE>

<HD>Richer Than Lorraine: Cheese Onion Quiche</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABBY MANDEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This quiche goes beyond the notable quiche Lorraine. It has crisp
bacon bits and a custard filling, but also quickly caramelized
onions, Gruyere cheese and chives. Make it a day ahead if you'd like,
then gently reheat it to serve warm or at room temperature.</LD>
<LD>   A quiche is best baked in a metal quiche pan or springform pan
with a removable bottom. That makes it easy to remove and transfer to
a serving platter. Since a quiche is rich, I like to pair it with a
refreshing salad--here, a shredded carrot and radish mixture. Dessert
is a wonderful compote of prunes stewed in red wine and Port.</LD>
<LD>   For a shortcut when making the quiche, you can use refrigerated,
ready-to-roll pie crust that can be rolled to fit the pan and baked
according to the directions on the package.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quiche With Bacon and Gruyere Cheese</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours
plus 3 hours cooling</TE>
<TE>   PASTRY</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon-size
pieces, chilled</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 3/4 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   Place the butter, egg, sugar, milk and salt in the bowl of a food
processor. Pulse on/off until the butter is coarsely chopped. Spoon
the flour evenly over the butter. Process just until the dough is
crumbly and beginning to cohere but not in a ball (overprocessing
will toughen the dough). Transfer the dough to a work surface. Gather
the dough together and knead it, folding it back on itself, until
it's in a smooth ball. Flatten it into a disk. Wrap the dough in
plastic; refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. (It can also
be frozen up to 1 month; thaw in the refrigerator.)</TE>
<TE>   Let the chilled dough rest at room temperature for 10 minutes
before rolling. Roll the dough on a well-floured surface into a
circle about 1/4 inch thick. Do not roll it too thin; it tastes
better thicker. Transfer it to a 9-inch quiche or springform pan (1
to 1 1/2 inches deep) with a removable bottom. Press it into place
without stretching the dough. Trim the pastry edge for a 1-inch
overhang. (Reserve any pastry scraps for patching later.) Fold the
overhang inside to form double-thick sides. Press this dough firmly
into place, pushing the crust up 1/4 inch above the edge of the pan
to allow for any shrinkage during baking. Refrigerate until the dough
is firm, about 1 hour (or freeze briefly). Line the shell with
parchment paper or foil; fill with dried beans.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the dough is starting to set, about 16 to 18 minutes.
Carefully lift out the paper and beans; continue to bake until
lightly browned, about 15 minutes more. Patch any cracks with thin
scraps of the reserved dough; it is not necessary to bake patches.
The shell can be filled while still hot from the oven.</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   3 thick slices applewood-smoked, lightly salted bacon, diced small</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons water</TE>
<TE>   3 small onions, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground white pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon flour</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup milk (regular or 2%)</TE>
<TE>   3 eggs, beaten</TE>
<TE>   1 cup grated Gruyere cheese</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced chives</TE>
<TE>   Place the bacon and 1/2 cup of water in a nonstick skillet. Bring
to boil, then drain off the water. Cook the bacon over medium-high
heat until browned, stirring often, about 4 minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   In the same pan, combine the oil, water, onions, salt and pepper
to taste; cook over medium-high heat, covered, stirring occasionally,
for 4 minutes. Uncover, add the sugar and cook until lightly browned,
about 4 more minutes. Stir in the flour. Remove from the heat. Stir
in the cream, milk, eggs and reserved bacon.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully ladle the filling into the baked crust; use a fork to
evenly distribute the onions and bacon. Sprinkle evenly with the
cheese, then the chives (or if making ahead, sprinkle with chives
when reheating to keep their bright color).</TE>
<TE>   Place the quiche on a baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees until
browned and puffy, about 35 to 40 minutes.Cool on a rack at least 10
minutes before serving. (The quiche can be cooled completely and
refrigerated overnight. Before reheating, let it come to room
temperature. Reheat at 300 degrees for 15 minutes.)</TE>
<TE>   To serve, transfer the quiche from pan to platter. Serve warm or
at room temperature, cut into wedges.</TE>

<HD>This Bud's for Use: Get to Know the Artichoke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE LEVY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I first encountered an artichoke, I felt intimidated by the
green flower bud. But I realized that artichokes are fun to eat and,
though they might appear to be encased in armor, they actually are
simple to prepare.</LD>
<LD>   Before cooking artichokes, you cut off their tops and snip off the
spiky tips of the remaining leaves. Then you boil or steam them.</LD>
<LD>   To eat one, pull off a leaf, dip its bottom in sauce if you like
and scrape the meat from the leaf's base with your teeth. When you've
finished the leaves, you come to a cone of thin purple leaves, which
you discard. Under them is the fuzzy, inedible choke. Pull it out or
scrape it off with a spoon. What's left is the prized artichoke
bottom, often called the heart, which you can eat with the same sauce
you've used on the leaves.</LD>
<TE>   Cook extra artichokes so you'll have the hearts for other
recipes--if you can resist eating them immediately. They're terrific
in salads, pasta dishes and stews.</TE>
<TE>   Choose compact artichokes that feel heavy for their size, with
their leaves (technically bracts) closed, firm and not dry. I go for
those with as much stem as possible. The peeled stems have the same
flavor and texture as the hearts, and I cringe when I see people
throw them away.</TE>
<TE>   Large artichokes are impressive and have big hearts, but small or
medium ones cook faster and need little trimming. You can keep
artichokes unwashed in the refrigerator up to five days.</TE>
<TE>   Both delicate and assertive tastes complement artichokes. Some
people prefer thick dips they can lift on a leaf, such as buttery
hollandaise sauce or aioli, the Provencal garlic mayonnaise. Others
like to dunk each leaf in melted butter or vinaigrette. In France the
vinaigrette might be tangy with mustard or subtly seasoned with
walnut oil and wine vinegar, in Italy accented with capers and
olives, in Greece flavored with olive oil, lemon juice and dill and
in California peppered with chiles. Fresh herbs, diced roasted
peppers or chopped sun-dried tomatoes make tasty additions to any of
these dips.</TE>
<TE>   Don't try to match artichokes with wine; they have a peculiar
attribute of making it taste funny. And enjoy this sensuous symbol of
spring as the starter for a relaxing dinner, not when you're rushed
or ravenous.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Artichokes With Two Sauces</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour *
Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Serve your artichokes with Mustard Vinaigrette and Chipotle Chile
Dip or with a double recipe of either one. Chipotle chiles are smoked
jalapenos that you can buy canned in adobo sauce at well-stocked
supermarkets and Latino markets. For variations, use minced fresh or
canned jalapenos, Indonesian sambal oelek, North African harissa or
any kind of hot pepper sauce you like. This recipe allows generous
amounts of the sauces (about 2/3 cup of each sauce) in case you want
to serve them in individual bowls. You can cook the artichokes and
prepare the dips up to 2 days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARTICHOKES</TE>
<TE>   4 medium or large artichokes or 8 small or 12 baby artichokes</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Baby artichokes don't need trimming. With the other artichokes,
cut off the top quarter, about 1 inch of large or 1/2 inch of small
ones, using a sharp, heavy knife or a serrated knife. Trim the spikes
from the tips of the leaves with scissors. With baby artichokes,
leave the stems attached. With others, cut off the stems and peel off
their fibrous outer layer with a paring knife. Wash your hands and
the board after handling raw artichokes, or the next foods you handle
or cut will have a funny taste.</TE>
<TE>   Place the artichokes and stems in a large saucepan of boiling
salted water and cover with a lid of slightly smaller diameter to
keep them submerged. Cook over medium heat until a leaf near the
bottom can be easily pulled out, but don't cook them until mushy.
Small ones need about 15 to 20 minutes, medium ones about 25 to 35
and large artichokes about 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Using tongs, remove the artichokes and set them upside down in a
colander to drain. (Don't save the cooking liquid; it doesn't taste
good.)</TE>
<TE>   Either cover them to keep them warm, or let them cool and serve
them at room temperature or chilled. Accompany them with bowls of
dipping sauce.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons white or red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup oil, plus 1 more tablespoon if needed</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced shallot or 2 tablespoons minced green onion</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   Whisk the mustard in a bowl with the vinegar, and salt and pepper
to taste. Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup of oil. Taste, and add more oil
if the dressing is too sharp. Stir in the shallot and parsley. Taste
and adjust the seasoning. Whisk again before serving.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHIPOTLE CHILE DIP</TE>
<TE>   2 large cloves garlic, chopped, or 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped
garlic chives</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons strained lime or lemon juice, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   1 or 2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, 1 to 2 tablespoons
chipotle salsa from a jar or 1 teaspoon liquid hot sauce, or to taste</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup mayonnaise, reduced-fat or regular</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons chopped cilantro, optional</TE>
<TE>   Blend the garlic (but not the garlic chives) and the lime juice in
a food processor. Remove 1 chile from its adobo sauce, add the chile
to the processor and blend it to a puree. Add the mayonnaise and
process until blended. Taste; if you want more heat, add 1 teaspoon
of the adobo sauce or dice another chile, add it to the sauce and
process until well blended. Transfer the dip to a bowl. Add salt and
more lime juice if needed. Add the cilantro and the garlic chives, if
using.</TE>

<HD>AN HONORABLE HOUSE</HD>
<DH>A loyal son opens a dumpling restaurant in Arcadia to
preserve his family's reputation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YASMIN TONG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Frank Yang left Taipei for Los Angeles 15 years ago, he
promised his father and older brother that he would not open a new
branch of the family's internationally renowned Din Tai Fung Dumpling
House.</LD>
<LD>   "My family opposed it. You work very hard, very late hours," Yang
recalls. "They said, 'Just get a regular job where you don't have to
work on the weekends.'"</LD>
<LD>   Yang followed his father's advice, and for 13 years he worked
Monday through Friday as a garment inspector. Meanwhile he watched
two restaurants--which had used the Din Tai Fung name (pronounced
deen tie fung) without his family's permission--go bankrupt.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually Yang recognized that he had to preserve Din Tai Fung's
reputation and his family's honor. He reluctantly accepted his
destiny and opened Din Tai Fung in Arcadia two years ago, the only
one outside Asia. In addition to the Taipei headquarters, there are
four of the dumpling houses in Japan and one in Shanghai; another is
set to open in Hong Kong later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Dumpling houses are ubiquitous throughout Asia and typically serve
a simple menu of dumplings and noodles. Din Tai Fung, which is
building quite a name for itself, offers a traditional Shanghainese
menu composed primarily of handmade noodles, aromatic soups, rice
cakes, steamed buns and, of course, dumplings. With the sole
exception of the vegetable dumplings served in Arcadia, all Din Tai
Fung restaurants offer the same menu with three different dumplings:
onion-shaped juicy dumplings, shiao mai and delicate soup dumplings,
which are available only on weekends in very limited quantities.</TE>
<TE>   The juicy dumplings are Din Tai Fung's signature dish. They are
made from a long coil of dough that is pinched into small pieces and
rolled into paper-thin disks. A spoonful of filling--pork with
shrimp, vegetables or crab--is added to the center, and the dough is
pulled and crimped into a series of tiny swirling folds that are
pinched closed at the top.</TE>
<TE>   When cooked, the result is an artfully pleated pouch holding a
filling that has been steamed in its own succulent juice. It is salty
and faintly sweet and mingles the flavors of ginger, soy, vinegar and
savory steamed pork. These dumplings are eaten in one bite to avoid
losing any of the precious juice.</TE>
<TE>   The shiao mai (pronounced she-ow my) filling of pork with shrimp
or sweet rice is nearly identical to the juicy dumpling, except that
the dough is formed into an hourglass-shaped cup that is gently
packed with filling. With their open tops, these savory dumplings are
more meaty than juicy and resemble the shiao mai in Cantonese dim
sum.</TE>
<TE>   Din Tai Fung's soup dumplings, which provide an even more intense
burst of flavor, are so delicate and complicated to make that Yang's
staff only prepares 30 to 40 steamers of them on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing Din Tai Fung to Southern California without compromising
the restaurant's reputation and high standards has been challenging
for Yang. Din Tai Fung stands out from other dumpling houses in
Taipei because of the Yang family's exacting commitment to providing
excellent food and service.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see inside the [Taipei] kitchen, and the quality is
better and the taste is better [than the Taiwanese competition],"
says Sandy Liu, a Taiwanese immigrant who lives in Arcadia. "I was
very surprised when I ate there--the waiter carried a disabled
customer [on his back] up three stories because there was no
elevator."</TE>
<TE>   Yang's opinion of what makes Din Tai Fung different is simpler.
"It's the juice," he says, kissing the fingers of his right hand. But
juice is only part of the Din Tai Fung success story.</TE>
<TE>   Yang and his family have replicated its popularity throughout
China and Japan. With a commitment to preserving Chinese culinary
traditions, the Yangs have turned their Taipei culinary landmark into
a kind of McDonald's of Shanghainese cuisine, where every dumpling in
every restaurant around the world is intended to taste the same as
the original. Each dumpling is made by hand, however.</TE>
<TE>   Din Tai Fung began 30 years ago with Yang's mother and father, Li
Pam Mae and Pin Ying Yang, and their Din Tai Fung cooking oil
business. As the oil processing and delivery enterprise lost business
to self-service grocery stores in Taiwan, the Yangs purchased a
four-table restaurant from one of their former customers.</TE>
<TE>   Using the same brand name as their cooking oil, which translates
roughly to "abundant ancient cookware," the Yangs opened the dumpling
house with two cooks and, in the early days, relied on their six
children to work in the restaurant. As Din Tai Fung's dumplings grew
in popularity, the dumpling house doubled in size, then doubled again
and again, eventually seating 300 in a narrow four-story building on
Hsin Yi Road in Taipei.</TE>
<TE>   Even with this rapid growth, the seating capacity could not keep
pace with the thousands of customers lining up each day for Din Tai
Fung's dumplings.</TE>
<TE>   The Yangs devised a system using video monitors, walkie-talkies
and computers to serve customers efficiently. When customers arrive
in the Taipei restaurant, they take a number and menu from the
hostess, place their orders and then wait an average of 30 minutes
outside. After their number is called, customers are ushered through
the kitchen past the chefs and seated at a table, where their order
is brought to them immediately. Downtime at tables is eliminated and
seating capacity is optimized in a city where space is at a premium.</TE>
<TE>   In Arcadia, where waits can be up to an hour on weekends, there's
no high-tech equipment, but customers place their orders with the
hostess when they arrive and receive their food soon after being
seated.</TE>
<TE>   While the Yangs were achieving assembly-line efficiency in their
Taipei restaurant, they were also figuring out how to serve more
customers abroad. A franchise agreement with Takashimaya, a Japanese
department store, helped them expand Din Tai Fung to Japan and China
without being involved in day-to-day operations.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Yangs continue to own and manage only the Taipei and
Arcadia restaurants, they require chefs at each new location to
complete a rigorous three-month training in their Taipei kitchen to
learn the original recipes.</TE>
<TE>   But for Frank Yang in Arcadia, living up to this original Taipei
standard has required changing nearly every aspect of the way these
world-famous dumplings are made.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to spend extra money to have custom-made stainless steel
steamers built in Taiwan to match exactly the shape and size of the
bamboo ones we use," says Yang. The Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services forbids using bamboo steamers. "Still, [the flavor's]
not the same."</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge is the dry Southern California climate, which
reduces the juiciness of the dumplings. "You have to eat them right
away or they will dry out," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Getting all the ingredients for the menu was easy enough, given
Southern California's huge Asian population, but the flavors don't
always match those of Taipei. "The pork here is different--not as
sweet," says Yang. The Arcadia dumpling house has to mill a special
combination of medium- and low-gluten flour to get the right texture
for the dough.</TE>
<TE>   Yang's staff prepares and serves approximately 2,000 dumplings a
day, in addition to noodles and steamed buns, all made by hand on
site. Despite the hurried pace, a sense of controlled calm prevails
in the kitchen, which is visible through a big window at the entrance
of the restaurant, set in a mini-mall a few blocks south of Santa
Anita racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   Customers can watch chefs from China, Taiwan, Mexico and Guatemala
standing around a big chopping block furiously rolling out dumpling
dough with a tiny rolling pin in one hand, or crimping the dough into
an elegant swirl of folds around a savory filling of pork or crab.
Chefs wear all white, including a tidy cap, in an immaculate and
modern stainless steel kitchen where the only thing that seems out of
place is a light dusting of flour on the chopping block.</TE>
<TE>   Even after making all these adjustments to the recipes, Yang is
still not satisfied that Arcadia's Din Tai Fung mirrors the original.
"The taste right now is only 80% like Taipei," he says. "We are
always asking our customers what they think. Some customers say it's
close enough to Taipei. Others say the dumplings aren't as juicy."</TE>
<TE>   Yang now works 15-hour days. "The first six months [after
opening], I really regretted it," he says. "But now I have good
people working here. I am happy we did it."</TE>
<TE>   But like his father before him, Yang hopes his children do
something else.</TE>

<HD>Market Trend: Fantastic Growth in Celery Stalks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wild celery has thin, hollow stalks. You can get an idea of what they
look like by checking out a celery root (celeriac). At the top of it
you'll see the little round beginnings of stalks that have been
trimmed off.</LD>
<LD>   In the wild ancestral plant, those stalks are not only
insubstantial, they're too bitter to eat. This is why celery was long
grown only for its aromatic leaves and seeds.</LD>
<LD>   But in the 16th century, around the time that some European
farmers were breeding the big-rooted celery varieties that would
develop into celeriac, others started producing fleshy, edible celery
stalks by covering them up with dirt as they grew. In the absence of
sunlight, the stalks didn't turn green and bitter. It was pretty much
the same process that produces the white Belgian endive today.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually celery became an everyday addition to stew or vegetable
soup, but in the beginning, the additional labor meant it was
expensive. Even after 18th century farmers bred "self-branching"
varieties that didn't have to be "ramped" with dirt to produce thick,
sweet stalks, celery retained a luxury-food aura. It was very common
to savor celery by itself, braised in cream sauce, batter-fried or
raw with salt and olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   In the 19th century, Americans liked to serve a whole raw head of
celery as a special appetizer. They'd soak it in cold water until
serving time to get it as crisp as possible, then display it on the
table in a special "celery glass." Diners would dip pieces of stalk
in salt and eat them as a delicacy.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, this evolved into the use of celery in the early 20th
century restaurant relish tray (which it shared with carrots, olives
and radishes). On the other hand, it led to stuffed celery. Careful
celery stuffers still soak the stalks in ice-cold water before
putting on the cheese filling.</TE>

<HD>Taking on Passover Breakfast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY ZEIDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Preparing breakfast is a real challenge for the home cook during
Passover, since the use of flour is forbidden during this eight-day
period. But I love breakfast, and over the years I have created many
Passover dishes that my family enjoys at the morning meal. Passover
begins at sundown on March 27.</LD>
<LD>   Try starting breakfast with a bowl of cold fruit soup made with
freshly squeezed orange juice. Use blood oranges, now in season; they
yield a strikingly beautiful raspberry-colored juice. You may not
think of serving orange juice in this manner, but it is delicious.
Simply pour the juice over sliced strawberries, which are at their
sweetest this time of the year.</LD>
<LD>   One breakfast challenge in my house is attempting to satisfy
everyone's tastes. Our daughters and their families, who live in
Oregon, stay with us during the holiday, and finding something
everyone likes to eat is almost impossible. I tried buying the usual
Passover dry cereals for the grandchildren, but they did not go over
very well.</LD>
<TE>   But they all love my Matzo Farfel Granola. It has become a popular
snack, and sometimes the kids combine the granola with milk and
sliced bananas. I now make it year-round and use dried fruits that
vary from cranberries to chopped apricots.</TE>
<TE>   One breakfast treat comes from leftovers. I always bake several
different sponge cakes for our Passover Seders, and I like to use
slices the next day to make Passover French Toast. A little sweeter
than the traditional kind made with bread, it has a light, airy
consistency. It's delicious with fruit preserves.</TE>
<TE>   For something more different yet, thin slices of fruitcake are a
nice treat with your morning latte or cappuccino. This fruitcake
recipe, which I adapted for Passover, came from Sandy Krusoff. She
makes her fruitcakes for friends three or four times a year, and this
year we were lucky to receive one. The ingredients, a combination of
dried fruits and nuts, remind me of the charoset we serve at our
Seder.</TE>

<TE>   1/2 cup raisins</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup diced dried apricots</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and
lightly oil the foil.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the farfel, almonds and coconut in a large bowl. Pour in
the honey and oil and mix well. Spread the mixture on the baking

<HD>I Enter the Kid Food Universe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the yogurt that raised the first warning.</LD>
<LD>   I am old enough to remember when yogurt was strange, consumed
mostly by 100-year-old Russians, communists with a small "c" and
dieters grown weary of cottage cheese. No way a kid would eat it,
even if you covered it in whipped cream and put a cherry on top.</LD>
<LD>   Now, of course, that's how it comes--with whipped cream and
cherries, on top or on the bottom, with chocolate chips and cookie
crumbs, with sprinkles shaped like dinosaurs or witches' hats, with
powder that changes colors when you stir it in. There's yogurt in a
big bottle, a little bottle, a big cup, a little cup; there's yogurt
in a tube. Some of it is the traditional pastel-hued fruit flavors,
but there's also bubble gum and cotton candy in colors last seen in
the '60s on a Peter Max poster. And all of it's for kids.</LD>
<TE>   When I became a parent, I expected to start purchasing things I
had previously passed up. Things such as SpaghettiOs and apple juice,
frozen waffles and hot dogs, string cheese and those really orange
crackers with peanut butter between them. But I was not prepared to
enter an alternate grocery universe where juice comes in a bag,
macaroni and cheese in a can and milk in a box, a place where fruit
and cookies and corn dogs and carrots all come in leprechaun-sized
packages--a place where ketchup is green and margarine blue and
everything is shaped either like a dinosaur or Winnie-the-Pooh.</TE>
<TE>   Kids' food has ever been with us, as this year's 100th anniversary
of Animal Crackers and the enduring popularity of the chicken nugget
proves. But never before has it been such a large and diverse market.
From Oscar Mayer packaged Lunchables to Ritz Bitz, from
dinosaur-egg-littered oatmeal to the immortalization of every critter
imaginable in a fruit snack, kid food occupies shelf space in every
aisle of the supermarket. It's as if Cap'n Crunch and Count Chocula
roused the cereal aisle and took over the whole store.</TE>
<TE>   Though shocking in a
isn't-this-how-things-started-to-look-right-before-the-fall-of-Rome
way, this state of affairs is probably not cause for alarm in the
average adult. For a parent, on the other hand, it is yet another
dilemma to be unraveled, yet another pit and pendulum to be faced
down. While an unencumbered adult is free to walk past the new
single-serving frost-it-yourself brownies and smirk, a parent knows
that, like it or not, this latest breakthrough in marketing theory
("Let kids do it themselves!" "Messy is fun!") will become part of
their lives, one way or another.</TE>
<TE>   Because if the playground is where we learn about Darwinian theory
and the social order, the lunchroom is where we learn to covet. It is
the first opportunity we have to bring tangible representations of
our families into a communal setting.</TE>
<TE>   And it is the first real indication we have that other parents
have different ways of doing things. That some moms think popcorn is
a vegetable while others make their own ravioli. That some dads
believe graham crackers with peanut butter absolutely count as a
sandwich and others think it's never too early to appreciate spinach.</TE>
<TE>   At the lunch table we experience our first snobbery and practice
the art of negotiation. Perusing the food of our peers, we learn the
power of packaging, the relationship of scarcity to desire and the
lure of the forbidden. Who doesn't remember the kid in second grade
who always got two Ring Dings? Or the girl who brought a bottle of
Yoo-hoo? Whose mom kept the leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken warm with
a complicated system of plastic wrap and aluminum foil? The first kid
to get a sackful of Doritos?</TE>
<TE>   In my day, the hierarchy of lunches was simple. On top were the
kids who got to buy lunch every day, followed by those who had the
most packaged, name-brand food and bought their milk, followed by the
rest of us who had our tuna fish sandwiches and carrot sticks, our
bananas and hard-boiled eggs, our store-brand cookies and Bionic
Woman thermoses full of Kool-Aid.</TE>
<TE>   As a parent, I was prepared to negotiate my way through this caste
system, prepared to make concessions that perhaps my mother had not,
prepared to buy the pudding cups I had so longed for, or the fruit
cups with the pop tops.</TE>
<TE>   But now I have no idea where I stand. I cannot bring myself to buy
kid-size anything when adult-size boxes and jars are so much cheaper
and I have more tiny Tupperware containers than I have brains. I
tried the drink sacks until I discovered their similarity in content,
and intent, to water balloons. After sniffing snottily over the
toddler meals with my first child, I found myself dumping them in the
cart by the armloads for my second.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm still too green to buy any meal in which the packaging
outweighs the food. Other kids may love their Trader Joe's quiches
and canned salmon, but I stand by the sandwich and banana, although
baby carrots are a real improvement over carrot sticks (remember how
they were always dry and curling up a bit by the time you got to
them?).</TE>
<TE>   The only thing I'm sure about in this new Munchkin Land universe
is the yogurt. My kids love the yogurt. I try to buy the adult
version in the hopes of keeping the sugar to a reasonable level and
also because I refuse to believe that cotton candy yogurt tastes
good. But I buy it in the cups and in the bottles and especially in
the tubes, I buy it with stir-ins and sprinkles, and I have even
bought it with the powder that changes color. Which is pretty darn
cool.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This recipe calls for grilling the chicken breasts first before
finishing them in the oven, so that they have that good grilled
flavor. Using nonstick cooking spray--rather than oil--to keep them
from sticking to the grill keeps the fat down. Despite the grill
time, the dish comes together quickly. And, if you'd like, you can
make the tomatillo sauce ahead, then reheat it.</LD>
<LD>   Tomatillos, also called Mexican green tomatoes, can be found in
most supermarkets. Canned can be substituted for fresh.</LD>
<LD>   Add a touch of richness to the chicken by topping it with a few
paper-thin pieces of panela cheese, a part-skim milk Mexican cheese.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baked Tomatillo Chicken</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 pound tomatillos</TE>
<TE>   2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons oil</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, 1 minced, 1 cut in half lengthwise, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup minced onion</TE>
<TE>   1 serrano chile, seeded and minced</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons lime juice</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1 to 1 1/4 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces thinly sliced panela cheese</TE>
<TE>   Remove and discard the husks from the tomatillos then wash them
under running water. Combine the tomatillos and water in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil and simmer until the tomatillos are tender, about 10
minutes. Puree the tomatillos with the cooking liquid and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Coat a nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Add the oil and heat
over medium-low heat. Cook the minced garlic, onion and chile in the
oil until tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatillo puree. Bring
to a simmer and cook until the puree thickens slightly, about 5
minutes. Season with salt to taste and the lime juice. Keep the sauce
warm while preparing the chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a well-seasoned grill pan or outdoor grill to medium-high
heat.</TE>
<TE>   Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the
cumin evenly over both sides of the chicken breasts and rub over the
surface. Rub the chicken breasts with the cut sides of the remaining
clove of garlic. Lightly spray the chicken with nonstick cooking
spray and grill, 5 minutes on each side.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the grilled chicken in a small baking dish and cover with
the warm tomatillo sauce. Top each of the chicken breasts with the
cheese slices. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink in the
center, 15 to 20 minutes.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's no coincidence that the Temecula farmers market, one of the few
actually operated by farmers, is also one of the best. Gale and
George Cunningham, small-scale organic growers in the nearby De Luz
district, have shaped the market's roster of quality local producers;
the event also has a bustling crafts and prepared foods section.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, the Cunninghams brought sweet-tart Minneola tangelos,
macadamia nuts, top-quality Fuerte avocados and super-sweet, dark
orange, dried Fuyu persimmons. The Atkins Nursery of Fallbrook sold
white sapotes, which taste like banana flan when ripe; acid-less
Palestine sweet limes; and round, sweet Meiwa kumquats, which are
much better for eating fresh than the common oval Nagami variety.</LD>
<LD>   Julie Gama of Valley Center Orchards had fine Washington navel
oranges, Moro blood oranges and Oroblancos, from a grapefruit-pummelo
hybrid. She and her husband both come from farmers market families,
which run Lilac Valley Farms and Gama Farms, respectively; they met
nine years ago at the Monrovia farmers market, married and started
their own farm. Neal and Carol Bratton, who met at the Temecula
market, had impeccably fresh lettuces, including Merveille des
Quatres Saisons, Ruby and Butter Crunch, and fabulously aromatic
pepper powders: yellow Peruvian Aji, fiendish Caribbean Red and
flavorful Hungarian paprika.</LD>
<TE>   Kris Olsen of Cahuilla Mountain Farm in Aguanga displayed gorgeous
organic vegetables, including Red Torpedo young onions, sweet
Chioggia ("Candy cane") beets, long, thin Nelson carrots and pristine
oyster mushrooms. The Rodriguez stand of Escondido sold tender baby
mustard, collard and dandelion greens, as well as leeks and radishes.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Imoto of Vista had sweet, juicy Chandler strawberries, sugar
snap peas and artichokes. Andrea Peterson of Fallbrook had superb
organic baby lettuces, watercress, Red Russian kale and tat soi,
immaculate except for the occasional nibbles taken out of the leaves
by tiny critters.</TE>
<TE>   Albert and Annie Duhart sold brown eggs, navel oranges and
butternut squash. Born in the French Basque country, Albert drove
trucks before immigrating to the U.S. to work in construction; for
the last four years he has farmed in Temecula, where his main summer
crops are tomatoes, watermelons and the famous Basque Espelette hot
peppers.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes one extra step can make a difference in a dish. That's the
case with this curried chicken. The little detail is in the toasted
coconut garnish.</LD>
<LD>   A garnish can add more than flavor; it can add visual appeal.
Think about it: thinly sliced fried leeks on top of fish; toasted
nuts in rice or couscous; toasted coconut for crunch and a bit of
sweetness in curry.</LD>
<LD>   Taste this and you'll see what I mean. It's all in the
fine-tuning. And toasting coconut only takes a couple of extra
minutes--just spread some on a baking sheet and toast until browned.
Be sure to use chicken thighs that are boned but not skinned.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coconut Curried Chicken</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes* Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground coriander</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless chicken thighs (about 3/4 pound)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup shredded coconut</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   2 serrano chiles, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, minced</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 cup coconut milk</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lime juice</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the salt, cumin, coriander, cayenne and turmeric in a
small bowl. Rub the mixture onto the chicken and let stand 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, spread the coconut on a baking sheet and toast until
golden brown, stirring once, 5 minutes. Remove it from the oven and
set aside. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
chicken and cook until evenly browned, about 3 minutes a side.
Transfer the chicken to a baking dish and bake until the chicken is
cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While the chicken is in the oven, add the chiles, onion and garlic
to the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onion and chiles
have softened, about 4 minutes. Add the coconut milk and lime juice
and cook until reduced by about 1/4, about 4 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Return the chicken to the skillet and spoon the sauce over the
top. Cook over medium-low heat 2 minutes. Serve the chicken over the
Cilantro-Mint Rice. Top with the toasted coconut.</TE>

<LD>"The wine was an Italian Sauvignon Blanc, the 2000 Schiopetto Collio
from the Friuli region [in the mountains north of Venice] that I had
at lunch. Since Spottswoode produces a small amount of Sauvignon
Blanc each year, it is educational for us to try others, both from
California and around the world. It was a delicious wine--its nose
showed a delicate richness, with mineral and honey hints. As it spent
more time in the glass, it also gave off hints of lime and
lemongrass. It was equally lovely on the palate, and I enjoyed it
immensely!"</LD>

<LD>Sunday night in Venice. Storm-tossed palm fronds litter the sidewalk
outside the canal-side home-cum-gallery of artists Karen and Tony
Barone. Inside, perhaps three dozen guests help themselves to a
vegetarian buffet served on a Formica top set on the shell of a 1958
Cadillac.</LD>
<LD>   There is sprouted hummus from Venus of Venice, meatless beef
stroganoff from Native Foods, chicken-less sweet and sour chicken
from Vegan Express, and so on. The star of the evening is a pizza
made with a milk-less mozzarella that melts like real cheese. Cooks
hand out their cards, but they are not any cooks. They wear turbans
and turquoise Easter hats.</LD>
<LD>   The meal is a prelude to an inspirational speech from vegan
activist Howard Lyman, a.k.a. "the mad cowboy." The nickname comes
from the mad cow crisis of 1996, when he appeared on the "Oprah" show
and, based on his description of cattle-feeding practices, Oprah
Winfrey declared that she would never eat burgers again. Lyman then
became a co-defendant with Winfrey in a product libel case with the
Texas cattlemen, which, after a six-week trial in 1998, they won.</LD>
<TE>   Lyman is in town to tape an appearance on "Politically Incorrect
With Bill Maher" and to rally the faithful behind his vegetarian
charity, Voice for a Viable Future. The Barones stand near the
buffet, greeting guests. Tony is the corpulent bon viveur; Karen is
super-slim and decked in knee-high boots, fish-net stockings, hot
pants, long wig and Cleopatra-issue eye makeup. The Barones can't
remember when they first heard Lyman speak, but they were so
impressed they have been intermittently opening their home for him to
give talks ever since. The attendees are local cooks, farmers,
friends of friends called in to hear the prophet. The Barones point
to the friend they have invited in hopes of converting her to
vegetarianism. "We're worried about her health," confides Karen.</TE>
<TE>   "Karen and I have been vegetarian for 30 years and vegan for half
of that!" cries Tony, hugging Karen. "Initially we did it for very
selfish reasons. We wanted to live longer. Then you realize you don't
have to kill animals or screw up the environment."</TE>
<TE>   As the plates are cleared, the guests take seats among the
scattered sculptures. Lyman gives the speech that he has been giving
since becoming a vegetarian in 1990. He tells how he was a
fourth-generation cattle rancher from Great Falls, Mont., with 7,000
head of cattle, how illness forced him to look at his diet and his
farm practices, how he sold the farm and how a second shot at health
set him on the road to preach the cause of vegetarianism. He hails
the resolve of members of the audience--the farmer who stopped
raising grain for livestock feed and switched to beans for
vegetarians, the chef who opened a vegan fast-food restaurant, and so
on. There is applause. Lyman is preaching to the choir, he knows. The
idea is to make the choir get out and convert more people into
vegetarians.</TE>
<TE>   "You can either go to the good side, or the bad side," he says,
"but it's up to you. When I see what Gandhi did in India, what Martin
Luther King did in America and what Nelson Mandela did in South
Africa, I am reminded: Never underestimate what one person can do."</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Several years ago the Food section had a holiday menu that
included a wonderful Port wine-glazed crown roast of pork. When I
couldn't find my original clipping--which has drops of Port on it--I
made it from memory, but I'm not sure I remembered everything!
Everyone always wants the recipe.</LD>

<TE>   Port Wine-Glazed Pork Crown Roast</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   PORT WINE GLAZE</TE>
<TE>   1 cup ruby Port</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup red currant jelly</TE>
<TE>   Combine the wine and currant jelly in a small saucepan. Heat to a
simmer. Reduce to 1/2 cup; this should take about 15 minutes. Reserve
2 tablespoons of the glaze for the sauce.</TE>
<TE>   ROAST</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 large clove garlic, cut in half</TE>
<TE>   1 (7- to 8-pound) pork crown roast</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup brandy</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon water</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Lightly brush a roasting pan with
olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   Rub the cut side of the garlic halves all over the surface of the
roast. Sprinkle the thyme, rosemary, marjoram and salt and pepper to
taste over the meat and rub it into the meat. Place the roast in the
pan crown side up. Cover the tips of the bones with foil to prevent
burning.</TE>
<TE>   Roast until a meat thermometer reaches 155 degrees, 15 to 20
minutes per pound. Brush with the glaze during the last 15 minutes of
roasting. Remove the roast to a carving board; let stand about 15
minutes before carving.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, pour off the juices from the pan, about 1/2 cup, into a
saucepan. Add the brandy to the roasting pan, stirring to loosen any
browned bits from the bottom of the pan, then add to the pan juices.
Stir in the reserved 2 tablespoons of the glaze. Bring to a simmer.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the cornstarch and water until blended. Stir into the
sauce and bring to a boil. Stir until slightly thickened and clear,
about 2 minutes. Serve a tablespoon of sauce along with each serving
of roast.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Several years ago you published a fabulous pasta casserole
that included linguine, chicken and portabello mushrooms. The chicken
was cut up, dipped in flour and fried, then mixed with the linguine
and mushrooms. My family is requesting it for Easter.</LD>
<LD>   Also, do you have a Los Angeles Times cookbook?</LD>
<LD>   RACHEL TAYLOR</LD>
<TE>   Via e-mail</TE>
<TE>   DEAR RACHEL: Our newest cookbook, "Los Angeles Times Modern
California Cooking," is available at bookstores, or call (800)
246-4042 or go to www.latimes.com/bookstore to order. It's $21.95.</TE>
<TE>   Here's your recipe, just in time for Easter. It's an Abby Mandel
do-ahead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baked Linguine With Chicken, Mushrooms and Basil</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound linguine</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 tablespoons dried porcini mushrooms, broken into small
pieces (about 1/2 ounce)</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 tablespoons hot water</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1/2 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon dried oregano</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 cups plus 2 tablespoons chicken broth, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons thinly sliced basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   Cook the linguine in a large pot of rapidly boiling water until al
dente, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Place the dried
mushrooms and water in a small bowl to soak. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet
over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onion. Cook until heated
through and fragrant, about 2 minutes, stirring often. Add the fresh
mushrooms, oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the dried mushrooms
and liquid. If the liquid is gritty, strain through a filter paper or
triple thickness of cheesecloth placed in a small strainer. Cook,
uncovered, until the mushrooms have cooked through completely and the
mixture has thickened, about 5 more minutes, stirring often.</TE>
<TE>   Stir 2 tablespoons of the flour into 1/4 cup of the chicken broth.
Add to the skillet along with the remaining broth and wine. Simmer,
uncovered, until the liquid has reduced by 1/3, about 7 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Stir in the linguine and 1/3 cup of the cheese.
Transfer to a greased 10-cup-capacity shallow baking dish. Wash and
dry the skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the chicken into 1-inch dice. Combine the remaining 2
tablespoons of flour, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper
to taste in a large plastic food bag. Add the diced chicken in
batches. Separate the pieces if stuck together. Shake to coat the
chicken. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the remaining oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the
chicken. Stir-fry until light-brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Stir into the linguine mixture. Adjust the seasonings to taste. (This
can be made 2 days ahead and refrigerated, covered with foil. Let
stand at room temperature 1 hour before baking if chilled.)</TE>
<TE>   Stir in the basil leaves. Lightly compress the ingredients to
flatten the surface. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over. Bake the
casserole until browned, about 45 to 50 minutes. Serve hot. Spoon
some of the liquid in the bottom of the dish over each serving.</TE>
<TE>   6 servings. Each serving: 336 calories; 444 mg sodium; 83 mg
cholesterol; 11 grams fat; 3 grams saturated fat; 20 grams
carbohydrates; 36 grams protein; 2.32 grams fiber.</TE>

<HD>Sauvignon Blanc: Green, Mean and Otherwise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poor Sauvignon Blanc. Is there a more misunderstood grape? It's
maligned by some because it often produces wines with intense grassy
aromas and grapefruit-like acidity. Others speak ill of the richer
versions of Sauvignon Blanc just because they're not green and mean.</LD>
<LD>   But I like Sauvignon Blanc because it's so versatile. It makes
very enjoyable wine in a number of styles, many of which are
affordable.</LD>
<LD>   Here are notes on California Sauvignon Blancs representing a
variety of approaches. One wine, Selene 2000, transcends the usual
cubbyholes to which people consign this variety, and captures depth,
varietal character, richness and balance in a near-perfect package.</LD>
<TE>   * 1999 Beringer Vineyards "Alluvium Blanc," Knights Valley, $15.
This wine, blended with 12% Semillon and 10% Chardonnay and then
oak-aged, is clearly a member of the richer-is-better camp. I like
its pear and lemon blossom fruit, its sweet oakiness and its full,
balanced feel on the palate. It nearly deserves two stars and needs
just a bit more brightness to get there.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Bernardus Winery, Monterey, $14. With its strong grass and
mineral flavors, this is not a wine for all palates, but it's sure to
please those who like their Sauvignon Blanc to be steely, brisk and
unmistakably green in character. It shows a bit of oaky richness
without conceding an inch of its chosen style.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Buttonwood, Santa Ynez Valley, $10. Without landing
squarely in any of the varietal camps, this pleasing wine picks up
enough vitality, grass and oak to make itself perfectly drinkable in
a quiet, comfortable manner. Melon fruit mixes comfortably with
greens and hints of anise. It would be hard to find a nicer wine at
its inviting price.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Cain Musque, Monterey, $21. Musque is a clone of Sauvignon
Blanc that typically delivers more floral, almost Muscat-like tones,
but in this vintage the clone has proven to be less in control, and
the grassy, pineapple-like elements of Sauvignon Blanc have taken
over. This is not a wine for the faint of heart, but it will appeal
to those whose love of greens and acidity in Sauvignon Blanc can only
be sated with strong potions.</TE>
<TE>   $** 1999 Grgich Hills Cellar Fume Blanc, Napa Valley, $16. Try
finding a two-star wine in almost any other variety and you'll
probably be frustrated, yet here is a beauty of a wine at a steal of
a price. It's made in a firm, crisp, steely style with plenty of
acidity lifting and brightening its Crenshaw melon and Meyer lemon
qualities, and its smoky, oaky nuances add touches of complexity
without impinging on the wine's bracing direction. Don't look for
much in the way of grassiness here.</TE>
<TE>   ** 2000 Iron Horse "T bar T, Cuvee R," Alexander Valley, $20. The
addition of 16% Viognier clearly shows in the sweet and floral
aspects of this engaging wine's perfumed aromas. The flavor is
underpinned by lots of melon fruit and sports a streak of varietal
grassiness. This wine is fairly full-bodied and follows through well
on the palate. Sauvignon Blanc might not be a wine that people put in
their cellars to age, but this one has both the depth and the
youthful edginess that suggest improvement over the next year or two.</TE>
<TE>   $* Joullian, Carmel Valley, $13. Once again a wine you'd expect to
have greater range, considering the 24% Semillon in its makeup, that
is totally dominated by the grassy quality of Sauvignon Blanc. It's
brisk and firm on the palate, with more support from fruit for its
flavors of minerals and grasses than its acidy angularity might
suggest. Decidedly not a wine for casual sipping, it can comfortably
be paired with tangy seafood dishes.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Kenwood Vineyards, Sonoma County, $10. Kenwood's regular
Sauvignon Blanc gets my vote for the most consistent moderately
priced Sauvignon. This new vintage is clean and fruity with a
distinctly grassy character, and it has a lively, bright feel on the
palate.</TE>
<TE>   $** 1999 Quivira "Fig Tree Vineyard," Dry Creek Valley, $14. Yet
another wonderful value in Sauvignon Blanc. This wine makes a clear
varietal statement of greens and grasses yet hews as closely to
richness, ripeness and oak as it does to the leaner side of the
varietal spectrum. It has a fine fleshy feel and good body, but still
allows for plenty of snap and brightness throughout.</TE>
<TE>   *** 2000 Selene "Hyde Vineyard," Carneros, $22. Boasting a lovely
mix of ripe melons, piquant citrus, a bit of grass and a fine veneer
of creamy oak, this keenly honed wine edges up very close to varietal
perfection. Intense but nowhere near overbearing, it's remarkably
well focused, bright and beautifully balanced, and it shows a rare
sense of seamless proportion from start to finish. It earns my most
enthusiastic endorsement as the quintessential Sauvignon Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Symbols</TE>
<TE>   ***A world-class wine, superb by any measure, the top 1% to 2% of
all wines tasted.</TE>

Market in Long Beach sells both kinds: a spicy red chowder and a
mild, creamy white chowder. Jimmy's also makes a chowder loaf--a
scooped-out round of sourdough filled with whichever chowder you
prefer. Or you can leave the loaf whole and serve it on the side.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neither grassy nor sweet, this beautifully made Sauvignon Blanc--from
25-year-old vines on the Kelham family's estate in Oakville--has the
weight of a Chardonnay and the attractive citrus quality of a white
Graves. The scents of honeysuckle, citrus and a touch of new oak jump
right out of the glass. It's opulent yet full of mineral character,
and has a bright acidity that means it's made for food.</LD>
<LD>   One of the best California Sauvignon Blancs I've tasted.</LD>
<LD>   About $18. Available at John &amp; Pete's Fine Wines &amp; Liquor, Los
Angeles, (310) 657-3080; Larchmont Village Wine &amp; Cheese, Los
Angeles, (323) 856-8699; Village Gourmet, Studio City, (818)

<LD>Re "SUVs Should Be Driven Into a Truck Lane," Commentary, March 17:
Didn't John Balzar consult the SUV handbook? It states that SUV
drivers must:</LD>
<LD>   1. Start the day by driving to any Starbucks--taking two parking
spaces, please.</LD>
<LD>   2. Order the tank-sized coffee with a few shots of "expresso"
(even though there is no "x" in the word).</LD>
<TE>   3. When properly "caffed up," jump back into vehicle, gun engine
and back up as quickly as possible without checking for pedestrians
or traffic.</TE>
<TE>   4. Exit parking lot as if it were Daytona (at least).</TE>
<TE>   5. Pick up cell phone and commence conversation (with hand
gestures, if possible).</TE>
<TE>   6. On freeways and surface streets, bear down on and tailgate
everything smaller.</TE>
<TE>   7. Turn all corners using one hand--or none.</TE>
<TE>   8. At supermarket or mall, park as close as possible to driver's
door of other vehicles to prevent others from gaining access to their
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   9. Suspend all those rules of the road that were learned in
driver's ed.</TE>
<TE>   10. Switch lanes as often as possible, never using your
directional signals.</TE>

miles to the gallon!</TE>

<TE>   In "Stars, Stripes &amp; Gas Guzzlers" (editorial March 18), The Times
opines that senators should have compelled behavior by consumers by
mandating fuel savings through CAFE standards. Maybe you should
instead berate your readers for buying behemoths when they have the
option any day of the week of buying more fuel-efficient vehicles. It
may be more fun to blame Detroit and Washington, but it ain't honest.
This is America. We have choices. Let us exercise those choices
without nannying us to death.</TE>

<HD>Clean-Water Rules Drain Taxpayer Money</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Cities Exaggerate Cost of Water Cleanup" (Opinion, March 10),
David Beckman, Mark Gold and Steve Fleischli claim that over 50
cities and the County of Los Angeles "exaggerate" the cost of the Los
Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board's new storm water
regulations. On the contrary, the only exaggeration is in the actual
benefits of these ill-conceived rules.</LD>
<LD>   The water board failed to conduct the state-required economic
analysis prior to adopting these regulations. The chief legislative
analyst of the city of Los Angeles did that. The conclusion? That
"the global nature of the permit requirements would require the
expenditure of a great deal of money for very little return in storm
water improvements."</LD>
<LD>   We all--citizens and public officials alike--want cleaner water.
But it is senseless to waste scarce taxpayer money on unproven
programs that won't deliver meaningful environmental benefits.</LD>
<TE>   Beckman, Gold and Fleischli state that cities should not "be given
free rein to implement plans without having to prove that their
efforts were actually improving water quality." All we are asking is
that the regional board be held to the same standard.</TE>

Councilwoman Jacquie Sullivan believes she's "stand[ing] firm for

the walls of City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   I'd like to remind Sullivan that not long ago it was the opinion
of the "majority" that women should not hold public office or even be
allowed to vote. Fortunately for people like Sullivan, the U.S.
Constitution focuses its power on protecting the rights and beliefs
of the minority. She would do well to remember that.</LD>

<LD>"Let's Keep Koppel in Perspective" (Opinion, March 17), concerning
the disappearance of serious news from TV, clearly brings to mind
embarrassing facts that most of us would rather ignore. Most
contemporary commercial television is worse than a wasteland, and the
enemy who has created it is us. We buy the products advertised in the
inane commercials, which provides the cash flow that feeds the
wasteland.</LD>
<LD>   We allow our children and grandchildren to waste hundreds of hours
a year in front of a hypnotic medium because it is a cheap
baby-sitter. Our ability to focus attention on any one topic shrivels
in response to the mind-numbing few moments that an average image
stays on the screen.</LD>
<LD>   It has been reported that within seconds of focusing attention on
a television image, brain patterns in most individuals switch over to
a mode similar to sleep. If one is disposed to believe in conspiracy
theories concerning who or what is a declared enemy of America, one
might want to start with what individuals and international
corporations control major U.S. television media. Such an
oversimplified explanation would be fitting tribute to the dumbing
down of rational thought that commercial TV viewing encourages.</LD>

<TE>   "Nightline" may be among the best of news programs on commercial
TV. It is still shallow and poor. The program strives for controversy
as entertainment. A typical "Nightline" debate consists of two
people, who have no intention of either talking to each other or
listening to each other, hysterically shouting their prepared pitches
into the camera to finish them before the next commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Public television has at least a dozen programs that provide more
thoughtful attempts at honest disputation and information than this.
They are much more worthy of our concerned support.</TE>

<LD>Apparently letter writers (March 19) who believe that The Times

<LD>Re "Oscar Fever Is Pushing the Envelope of Civility," March 16: I
don't understand why people are making such a big deal over
"omissions" from John Nash's life in "A Beautiful Mind." The movie
isn't a documentary, folks; it isn't a literal retelling of his life.
The filmmakers took parts of Nash's life to create their story and
excluded others. I don't see everyone riled up over the classic film
"The Wizard of Oz" because it included some parts of L. Frank Baum's
tale and changed or omitted others.</LD>
<LD>   It's a shame that the nit-picking is overlooking "A Beautiful
Mind's" craftsmanship. Too bad it isn't an entirely made-up story,
for then people could have appreciated it for what it is--a motion
picture with a story to tell--instead of condemning it for what it is
not (a verbatim account of a person's life).</LD>

<DH>Twin schools stage elaborate projects to make and discover
'ancient' artifacts.</DH>

<LD>Bejeweled slabs of marble from India's Mughal empire, maps on
parchment recording silk-trading routes through ancient China,
mukluks worn by Inuit fishermen in the Arctic--all of these, plus
artifacts from 14 other early civilizations, were unearthed recently
in the dusty foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The novice archeologists who discovered these objects had also
created them, as part of an annual history project for freshmen at
The Webb Schools, two private high schools--one for boys and one for
girls--that share a campus in Claremont.</LD>
<LD>   The project, which began in December and ended last week, randomly
assigned 17 groups of students to research different cultures and
re-create characteristic objects.</LD>
<TE>   These forgers guarded their assignments tightly, mindful that
another group would be assigned to dig up their creations and guess
at their origins.</TE>
<TE>   The prep schools' boarders--who make up about 65% of the 365
students--hid their artifacts under their beds, away from roommates
on other teams. Code names were used to throw off any snoops. The
Tibet group toiled undercover as the Mongols. And the students
researching the Mayas paraded through the library with books about
the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   'Oldest' Objects Buried at Bottom of Holes</TE>
<TE>   Last month, to simulate their civilization's evolution, the
students buried the supposedly oldest objects at the bottom of holes
near the football field and layered "newer" objects on top. When the
time came to swap pits and excavate, the students, like professional
archeologists, used twine to mark their turf, the better to document
their discoveries in their logs. Then the digging began.</TE>
<TE>   Into the dirt the Tibet group plunged its shovels, immediately
striking something hard--a round, but now chipped, piece of brightly
painted terra cotta.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like some sort of calendar, maybe," surmised Thea
Hinkle, 14, a boarder at the all-girls Vivian Webb School. The object
appeared Mayan or maybe Aztec.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll take a little more research to figure out exactly," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The team of four bagged every shard of the pottery and, with
trowels, more carefully continued digging.</TE>
<TE>   Webb students dig digging. On field trips over the years across
California, elsewhere in the West and abroad, they have collected
tens of thousands of fossils for the third institution in the Webb
Schools triad, the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology. Students
serve as interns at the museum, and paleontology is heavily covered
in their ninth-grade science class and upper-level courses.</TE>
<TE>   Though rarely as elaborate as Webb's project, similar hands-on
archeological lessons are popular at many other schools, and at many
grade levels, said Skye Weaver, who designs educational programs for
the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy for kids to only think about living in the sense that
they do every day. Studying archeology opens up a whole new mind-set,
that there were many, many people and ways of life that came before
us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In California schools, Chumash Indian, Egyptian and Mesoamerican
cultures are studied most often.</TE>
<TE>   Students' romantic notions of archeology, formed by movies like
the "Indiana Jones" series and "The Mummy Returns," make the lessons
appealing.</TE>
<TE>   But, as the Webb students discovered, "there's definitely an
aspect of extraordinary tedious, hot, boring, sweaty, in-the-jungle
work," Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   After spending several days in their pit, and sifting out bead
after little bead, Thea's group learned that "you really need to comb
every inch of dirt," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After "restoring" broken objects and searching books and Web sites
for clues on what they had excavated, her team determined that their
pit contained Aztec relics.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Elghazi's group buried artifacts from the feudal Tokugawa
regime of Japan and uncovered Inuit, or Eskimo, objects. For the
16-year-old day student at the boys' Webb School of California,
digging was easier than determining what his group dug up and where
it came from.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a rock," Danny said, "or it could be an ancient
thing--an ancient artifact."</TE>
<TE>   Webb's history teachers have organized the schools' archeology
project for the last seven years, using it as a tool to cover early
civilizations but also to stress the broader skills of research,
analysis and teamwork.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of things that get worked out, which then tie into
things later," said Ingrid Gustavson, one of four teachers who
supervised the project.</TE>
<TE>   The project culminates in an evening fair attended by several
hundred parents, teachers and older students. The freshmen set up
elaborate displays of their uncovered civilization's government,
commerce and customs. The event is the "one time when ninth- graders
get to stand out in the community," Gustavson said.</TE>
<TE>   Costumes, Music and Flashy Graphics</TE>
<TE>   At this year's fair, held March 13 in Webb's student center, the
freshmen wooed visitors to their team's table with costumes, music
and flashy computer graphics. The group that excavated Tibetan
artifacts handed out a sweet, milky tea and balls of barley procured
by a Buddhist monk; the Maya group offered nacho chips and salsa.</TE>
<TE>   Webb's boys and girls mix throughout the school day, in places
like the cafeteria, the library and the newspaper office. But in
science, math, English, history and some foreign language classes,
the schools segregate boys from girls to tailor teaching to the
sexes' different learning styles and interests.</TE>
<TE>   Those differences were apparent in the archeology project.
Generally, the girls seemed to take great care in creating their
artifacts, favoring clothing and household objects made with peacock
feathers, gold trim and much painted cloth and pottery. The girls who
buried Tibetan objects charred scraps of paper and soaked them in tea
to suggest a back story of a Buddhist monastery burned by invaders.</TE>
<TE>   The boys, in their groups, tended to bury weapons. They seemed
satisfied with Styrofoam and scraps of wood.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a shield," one girl sniffed, "and the foil was taped
on."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the fair, some proud students saved their artifacts
as souvenirs. Others threw their re-creations of the past in the
trash, burying them, perhaps, for a future scavenger.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cheney Finds Israeli Issue Trumps Iraq," March 18:</LD>
<LD>   During the months of escalating death and destruction in the
Middle East, the Bush administration has been deaf to pleas to become
more involved in brokering a solution. Previous visits from U.S.
envoy Anthony Zinni to the region have been brief, ending with
statements that the parties must find a solution on their own.</LD>
<LD>   Now that Vice President Cheney has been dispatched to garner
support for the administration's unpopular plans to wage war on Iraq,
members of the administration suddenly see the need for a more
sustained and serious effort toward peace. However, they have left it
a little late, and Cheney is getting an earful from our allies in
that part of the world, to whom it makes no sense to further
destabilize the region by attempting to topple Saddam Hussein with no
real alternative to him in sight. All they foresee is more chaos and
suffering in the region.</LD>
<TE>   The administration's tardy efforts toward peace now seem only a
transparent attempt at manipulation rather than showing any real
concern for human suffering.</TE>

<TE>   The March 16 photo of the Star of David spray-painted on a
Palestinian home reminds me of nothing so much as photos of swastikas
spray-painted on synagogues in this country. The irony couldn't be
any heavier.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis--and their supporters here--seem to have been waging a
campaign to show the world that Jews can behave as badly as any other
people of the world. I believe them. Enough already!</TE>

<TE>   Re "Suicide Bombing Is Contagious," by Ranan R. Lurie, Commentary,
March 15: As an American Muslim, I am extremely offended. The concept
of killing civilians does not exist in the religion of Islam. The sad
acts of suicide bombings are the direct result of the brutal,
imperialistic Israeli occupation on the battered Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   Yet somehow it is forgotten that the murder of innocent
Palestinian human beings who are under siege by the U.S.-funded
Israeli war machine is also a crime. Ignorance and neglect of the
situation will only add to the long list of victims in this conflict,
both Israeli and Palestinian.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Nuclear Policy Makes for a Safer World," Commentary, March
18: Barry Blechman clearly lives in Fantasyland. Resuming nuclear
testing, threatening to use nuclear bombs and breaking treaties make
the world safer?</LD>
<LD>   Nuclear bombs could destroy the Earth, and any nuclear bomb, even
so-called "low yield," emits deadly radiation. Our new policy can
only lead to other nations building up their nuclear arsenals, thus
sabotaging the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty. As the most powerful nation in the world, we must
instead lead the way toward reduction and eventual elimination of
nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Ann Edelman</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am puzzled by the conclusion reached by Blechman that the new
nuclear policy is a major accomplishment and an important advance
toward ending nuclear dangers. As pointed out in Robert S. McNamara
and Thomas Graham Jr.'s March 13 commentary, "If a country believes
it's falling out of favor with Washington, what is the first thing it
is likely to do? . . . one must first acquire nuclear weapons." So we
damn the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which we extended in 1995
with over 180 countries and which has kept nuclear weapons from
spreading all over the world. The Nuclear Posture Review really sends
chills up everyone's spine.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Rep as Killer Drives Up Demand for Presa Canario," March 17:
Your article noted that the Presa Canario dog breed (the dogs that
killed Diane Whipple) and other breeds such as the Rottweilers and
pit bulls are sadly becoming more popular as a result of the woman's
death and subsequent trial.</LD>
<LD>   The city of Los Angeles uses animal licensing fees to control the
spaying and neutering of dogs by charging nearly $200 for unspayed
animals. I think the city should do the same and charge a higher
license fee ($200 or more) for those breeds responsible for the most
fatalities.</LD>

<LD>If you savor good food, these are wonderful days to be an American.
It's also a good thing for America.</LD>
<LD>   So says me. But, if you wish, you can put a question mark at the
end of that thought, and hear it from people with better credentials.</LD>
<LD>   "Hmmm, yes," answers Patric Kuh, the chef who is cooking me lunch
just now. "Something really exciting is happening. Ethnic divisions
in food are melting away, and we're the only country that could do
it."</LD>
<TE>   This is no small matter. Food is a cultural binding. Also a social
barometer and, more, a daily expression of our values. The rising
interest in food and all it means--family, friends, time well-spent,
honest pleasure--is one of those welcome counterpoints to those who
fret about our national direction.</TE>
<TE>   Kuh finishes searing two oversized Spencer steaks and tongs them
into the hot oven. As he speaks, he is not thinking about the meal he
is cooking, however, but about a small tamale with "ancho jus" that
he was served the other day. Where else would you find such a thing
except in the U.S., where culinary tradition, such as it exists, is a
refutation of rules, an amalgam of imagination, a sizzling kettle of
energy?</TE>
<TE>   This is not the only reason, of course, that our stomachs are on
our minds. Each season seems to bring improved ingredients to our
markets. Cooking, and by that I mean real cooking, not the grim
reheating of processed nutrients that remains the American stereotype
(and often the enduring fact), absorbs millions of us.</TE>
<TE>   Chefs have risen to the ranks of celebrities and moguls. And the
literature of food has grown to meet our hunger to appreciate it.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just armies that advance on their appetites. Societies
too. And nowhere else does our affluence offer such ready and
harmonious opportunity to fulfill our needs.</TE>
<TE>   It is the subject of food writing that has brought me to the
kitchen of Kuh's home in Los Angeles. The steak is a bonus. If we're
going to work, surely we're also going to work up an appetite, right?
I refer to him as "chef" because Kuh is French-trained and his resume
warrants the title. But he modestly demurs. "Call me a cook.... I
know what it means to be a chef."</TE>
<TE>   Kuh, however, is certifiably a food writer--an occupational
specialty that enjoys rising stature for helping us understand that
if we are not what we eat, perhaps we are doing it badly. A former
columnist for Salon.com, he is restaurant critic for Los Angeles
Magazine and author of the surprising and yummy history of American
restaurants and food culture called "The Last Days of Haute Cuisine."</TE>
<TE>   Throw in Anthony Bourdain's "Kitchen Confidential" and Jim
Harrison's "The Raw and the Cooked" and you have three of my favorite
books of the last 12 months. I could extend the list to any of a
dozen other volumes that explore the techniques, personalities and
philosophy of this simple matter with the overbearing word
"gastronomy." This is escapist literature at its best. What could you
expect from an essay on garlic mashed potatoes except a happy ending?</TE>
<TE>   In its own way, Kuh's is the most unusual of these recent books.
Naturally there would be a rich, character-filled, tumultuous
socio-history behind America's food craze. But who would have thought
to write it? (I met Kuh through his work, but I mention that his wife
is my literary agent as well as his.)</TE>
<TE>   Americans, he explained, "remade the restaurant business in our
own image."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, food has remade us. The home I purchased last year
in Southern California was built just after World War II and embodied
the modernized values of that age. The tiny eating area was tucked
away adjacent to the washer and dryer. Dinner was meant to be gulped
from trays in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   We've rearranged things, of course. The centerpiece of the living
room now is a dining table. The old kitchenette alcove accommodates
cookbooks.</TE>
<TE>   When I feel a bout of the blues coming on, I measure these changes
and I am uplifted by the evidence of progress--a step back to the
tradition that once a day we collect ourselves and our loved ones,
and three steps forward in how we do it. Nostalgia for the good old
1950s? When gummy cutlets went from freezer to gullet with no more
soul than 18 minutes at 400? No, thanks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have an hour to cook your dinner, quit your job,"
writes Jim Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   Kuh's steaks have rested on the counter for the same amount of
time they roasted, permitting the fibers of meat to un-tense. I won't
pretend to emulate the food writer's lapidary vocabulary. Let's just
say lunch was delicious. Another workday accomplished. But I am left
wondering. Could I do something with ancho jus in my own kitchen this
week?</TE>

is aroused, law enforcement is on alert, legislation is being
rewritten--all sensible reactions to the war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   What doesn't make sense is to use the terrorist attacks as an
excuse to close our borders to future immigrants or to close our
minds as to how to deal with the estimated 8 million illegal
immigrants in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Immigrant-bashing has been a favored tactic for many in the
Republican Party--remember California's Proposition 187?--but
President Bush and GOP leaders in Congress have wisely begun to
reverse that nativist trend.</LD>
<TE>   The president in particular has been aggressive with a
constructive agenda on immigration topics before and since Sept. 11:
backing the extension of 245(i) visas (allowing illegal immigrants to
remain with their families in the U.S. while applying for a green
card; the bill cleared the House on March 12), holding talks with
President Vicente Fox of Mexico on guest worker programs and
resisting calls for sealed borders and mass deportation.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush will meet with Fox and is expected again to
discuss a United States-Mexico accord to reform an immigration system
that everyone agrees is broken. Such a plan would strengthen our
borders by creating a regulated migration path and allow some
law-abiding, hard-working illegal immigrants to earn their way to
legal status.</TE>
<TE>   If there are potential evildoers among them, this handful must be
dealt with. But if we further isolate immigrants, as GOP firebrand
Pat Buchanan and others suggest, we make this task harder.</TE>
<TE>   A related issue is the children of illegal immigrants who are here
through the actions of their parents but are being punished by state
and federal laws for their parents' choices.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah) has introduced legislation called the
Student Adjustment Act that is a good example of the type of
initiatives that Republicans need to take. This measure also is
consistent with a recent decision by the regents of the University of
California to allow children of illegal immigrants living in the
state to pay the same tuition as other state residents.</TE>
<TE>   Cannon's legislation would restore a state's right to determine
who is a resident for purposes of higher education and would allow
for the naturalization of currently enrolled high school students of
good moral character.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it would recognize that it is a waste to invest
resources in making sure that these children graduate high school,
only to find themselves compelled to live in the shadows for the rest
of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   These are children whose parents brought them here without their
papers and who have grown up in the United States. They want to go to
college and are qualified to go to college, but out-of-state tuition
makes it impossible for them.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Moore of the libertarian Cato Institute and head of the
conservative Club for Growth testified before Congress last year that
a typical immigrant family pays an estimated $80,000 more in taxes
than it will receive in local, state and federal benefits over a
lifetime of eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a high political price that state and national
Republicans have paid for pursuing the so-called wedge issues in the
past. Look at the track record of GOP presidential and gubernatorial
candidates in California: Bob Dole in 1996 got 38% of the vote; Dan
Lungren in 1998, 38%; George W. Bush in 2000, 40%. During the same
period, California Republicans lost three congressional seats, two
state Senate seats and five Assembly seats.</TE>
<TE>   In California during the same decade, Latinos increased by more
than 3 million and Asians by nearly 1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the message of California Republicans has not grown over
the same period to appeal to these groups.</TE>
<TE>   The party and the country stand at a crossroads. Either we adopt a
restrictionist path, which calls for mass deportation of millions of
hard-working people, or we follow the president's lead and adopt
constructive reforms designed to end illegality, recognize the
contributions of immigrants and make our borders more secure.</TE>

<HD>South Africa Shouldn't Have to Go Tougher on Mugabe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALD HORNE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of the recent victory of President Robert Mugabe in
Zimbabwe elections, African nations--particularly South Africa--have
come under increasing pressure from the West to harshly condemn his
regime. Yet despite South Africa's move Tuesday to join in the mild
sanction of suspending Zimbabwe from a coalition of mostly former
British colonies, South African President Thabo Mbeki can be expected
to continue his "softly, softly" approach.</LD>
<LD>   However much criticism Mbeki comes under for going too easy on
Mugabe, he has his reasons. And punishing long-suffering South Africa
would only plunge it into further misery.</LD>
<LD>   Before turning up the heat on South Africa, the U.S. and the
European Union should look at Zimbabwe from a different perspective.
In the welter of denunciations of Mugabe, few have acknowledged that
during the long struggle to dislodge Zimbabwe's predecessor
state--the white minority regime of Rhodesia--he was viewed as a
plausible alternative to his Soviet-backed competitor, the late
Joshua Nkomo. One leading British diplomat of the day said that
"Mugabe's victory was the best thing that could have happened"
because Nkomo "would have let the Russians in."</LD>
<TE>   Just as the Cold War helps explain why Islamic fundamentalists
once were supported by the West in Afghanistan, the same reasoning
was used to favor Mugabe. Washington and London may have forgotten
this, but South Africa hasn't. Many there wonder why this is now
being ignored.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War era, Mugabe's party was a stiff and stern
critic of the African National Congress, which Mbeki now heads. At
the time, Mugabe was aligned with one of the fiercest political
opponents of the ANC. And although relations between Mugabe and the
ANC during the anti-apartheid struggle of the 1980s were proper, they
were certainly far from the picture of boon comrades that is too
often portrayed in the West.</TE>
<TE>   One must also bear in mind that South Africa's ANC--and a number
of other ruling parties in the region--hold no love for Mugabe's
opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, because it has made
alliances with opposition forces in South Africa. Despite the West's
support of the MDC, it is understandable that South Africa's Mbeki
would not favor those allied with his political opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The ANC, like many parties in the region, looks with suspicion at
the "Rhodesians" backing the MDC, especially because of their
all-too-eerie resemblance to the whites in South Africa's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The West would be well-advised to back off pressuring Mbeki to
become involved in efforts to more harshly sanction Mugabe. It is too
much to ask that the ANC provide aid and comfort to a movement in
Zimbabwe that--if assisted to power--would then help the ANC's
political foes in its own country.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, many South Africans believe conservatives in Washington
are predisposed to eroding the influence of the ANC because of its
closeness with the South African Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of pressing South Africa to further ostracize Zimbabwe,
the West should bolster South African leader's approach--which
reportedly includes calling for a government of national unity.
Punishing South Africa would be a wrongheaded policy.</TE>

<HD>Chief Parks' Supporters Should Back Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the weeks since Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn made his
announcement opposing another term for LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks,
black leaders have stepped up attacks on Hahn, apparently to great
effect. While Hahn, as the city's top elected official, had a right
to say what he thought about Parks, a recent Los Angeles Times Poll
demonstrated the high price the mayor paid. Hahn has suffered severe
political damage overall, and he has torpedoed his standing among
blacks in particular.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the politics, though, the bottom-line question remains:
Does Parks meet the standards of the Police Commission?</LD>
<LD>   Black leaders, if they sincerely want to help Parks, now must stop
their bashing of Hahn and the Police Commission and present a
credible case that Parks measures up to the commission's performance
requirements.</LD>
<TE>   They can point to several pluses.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has been complimented by an independent monitor--who is
overseeing a Justice Department-imposed consent decree--for
installing a computer system to track problem officers, for
initiating a system to compile statistics on possible LAPD racial
profiling, for aggressively investigating the use of deadly force by
officers and for establishing a comprehensive procedure to
investigate civilian complaints of officer misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has significantly increased the hiring and promotion of
minorities and women within the department, and he has eliminated the
open warfare that raged between former LAPD Chiefs Daryl Gates and
Willie Williams and the mayor and the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Black leaders also must not ignore the spurt in crime and
homicides, the claim that Parks disciplines those he dislikes but
promotes those he favors and the gutting of the senior lead officer
program, which many consider the heart of community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and the Police Protective League claim that Parks' failings
in these areas have driven down morale and chased good officers out
of the department.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Police Commission ultimately agrees that Parks is the
right man for the job, black leaders still should insist that Parks
finish the tasks of reforming and improving police performance.</TE>
<TE>   This requires that he give full cooperation to the inspector
general in investigating his handling of officer-involved shootings
and civilian complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Parks must continue to improve officer tactics to minimize
the risk of future outrages like the fatal shootings of Margaret
Laverne Mitchell, a middle-age homeless woman who allegedly
threatened a police officer with a screwdriver during an altercation
over a shopping cart, and actor Anthony Dwain Lee, shot when he
allegedly brandished a toy gun at an officer during a Halloween
party.</TE>
<TE>   Parks should publicly announce a timetable for completing the
remainder of the Christopher Commission reforms.</TE>
<TE>   And he should develop a comprehensive community policing training
plan that fully involves command and rank-and-file officers in
community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the department needs to recruit and retain officers
without compromising standards, and the senior lead officer program
must be fully implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Black leaders have dug a deep line in the sand on Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if they continue to beat up on Hahn and the Police Commission
before the panel has said or done anything about Parks, they risk
burying themselves in that sand along with the mayor.</TE>

<LD>The need has never been more urgent for Sacramento to help the people
living in squalor on California's streets. Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton's proposed Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act
of 2002 would do just that. But the $2.1-billion measure, which
lawmakers are planning to put on the November ballot, attempts to do
too much.</LD>
<LD>   Example: Besides helping the people who live under bridges and on
sidewalks, most of whom are battling mental illness and addictions,
it will also provide ''down payment assistance'' to healthy home
buyers shopping for, say, a $450,000 split-level ranch house.</LD>
<LD>   State leaders need to prioritize, pare the bill down and close
loopholes that would draw money away from those who need it most. To
our thinking, that means moving the most conspicuous and shameful
problem to the front of the line.</LD>
<TE>   As it stands, Burton's measure might be dubbed "The Developers'
Full Employment Act." The people it would attempt to help include,
among others, the disabled, "struggling families with no place to
go'' and farm workers. It would help teachers come up with a down
payment and subsidize student housing at the state's universities.</TE>
<TE>   All these efforts are worthy. But a bond measure that tries to do
too much will fail at everything. Government's decades-long inability
to move people off the streets will continue to demoralize
Californians.</TE>
<TE>   This state needs a success. To foster hope, Burton and his
colleagues would do better to focus their measure on the genuine
crisis. As it happens, this is the piece of the housing problem that
can be readily solved. A remedy would have the most immediate impact
on quality of life--not just for street dwellers but for everyone who
skirts someone sleeping on a city or suburban sidewalk. Besides,
fixing this mess makes the most economic sense, because chronic
street dwellers cost the public dearly as they cycle through jails
and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that truly taking care of these people is a better
way to manage taxpayer money. Counties are now cutting back hard in
that area. While California law requires counties to be "health
provider of last resort" to people suffering from life-threatening
medical conditions such as bullet wounds or pneumonia, state
legislators let them off the hook regarding mental health. A 1991 law
said they are responsible only for providing such services ''to the
extent resources are available.'' Now cash-strapped counties are
backing away from the kinds of care and programs that have a proven
record of moving indigents off the streets: housing that is linked to
counseling, substance abuse classes and job training.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone needs a decent place to live, and we know that there are
real problems for teachers, students, migrant workers, the elderly
and the disabled. But Burton's measure has swollen in its ambitions
to the point that it would be unlikely to have a significant impact
on any problem, while the one problem that can and must be
solved--mentally ill and addicted people living on sidewalks--grows
more dispiriting by the day.</TE>

<LD>Six months and a continent away, residents of the 49th state
remembered Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Sled dogs in red, white and blue booties pranced down Anchorage's
4th Avenue at the start of the 1,100-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race. New York Port Authority policeman David Lim, who survived the
collapse of the World Trade Center towers but lost his K-9 partner, a
yellow Lab named Sirius, rode the first sled out. And under the
spruce arch that marks the finish line in Nome, Swiss-born musher
Martin Buser last week claimed his fourth victory--and took the oath
to become a U.S. citizen.</LD>
<LD>   To appreciate the significance of all this, to know the depth and
breadth of this nation's continuing response to the attacks,
understand this about Alaskans: There is Alaska, and then there is
Outside. Anchorage is as far from Seattle as Los Angeles is from New
York, and that is too close for notoriously independent Alaskans.
This far-north expanse of ice and snow (28 inches fell on Anchorage
Sunday, but who's counting?) can be a world unto itself. Sourdoughs,
as the old-timers are called, still remember receiving the nightly
news from Outside on videotape--via the next day's plane.</LD>
<TE>   If cable, satellite and the Internet have since forged
technological links to the last frontier, the terrorist attacks
clinched the human one. Buser has lived in Alaska since 1979. The
popular musher--known for singing his dogs to victory (they race, he
says, to get away from his voice)--already considered himself an
Alaskan. On Sept. 12, he applied to become a naturalized American.</TE>
<TE>   Sled dogs first raced to Nome in January 1925, not in sport but
carrying serum to treat a deadly diphtheria epidemic. Then as now,
tragedy and heroism knit the country together. Transfixed by radio
and newspaper reports of the rescue mission, New Yorkers honored
Balto, the lead dog on the last leg of the relay, with a statue in
Central Park. Today New Yorkers live with Sept. 11 every day,
reminded of horror and loss by the gash in the ground and the gap in
the skyline. And 4,600 miles away, red, white and blue-bundled
Alaskans and a flag-waving musher paid tribute.</TE>

<HD>A Fence Around Mugabe</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The loser of last week's presidential election in Zimbabwe, Morgan
Tsvangirai, called the result "daylight robbery." That's not a
runner-up's whine; that's the truth.</LD>
<LD>   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, honored leader of the fight
for independence a generation ago and ruler ever since then, rigged
the balloting. Tuesday, Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and
Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria joined with Australian Prime Minister
John Howard and responded by suspending Zimbabwe from the
Commonwealth, the coalition of 54 nations that are mostly former
British colonies.</LD>
<LD>   Although the move is largely symbolic, it undercuts Mugabe's
attempts to portray his critics as just white defenders of
colonialism. It also marks a break from the traditional reluctance of
African nations to criticize each other publicly. It was certainly
the smart thing to do in preserving the economic viability of
southern Africa.</LD>
<TE>   Mugabe's chaotic land redistribution, from mostly white farmers to
the angry landless, is guaranteed to kill outside investment.
Election fraud only deepens the flight of money. Unless a clear line
is drawn around Mugabe by South Africa, Nigeria and their neighbors,
outsiders with cash and expertise may write off the whole region.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe gloated that his win was "a stunning blow to imperialism"
and said Tsvangirai was a stooge of "Britain and its white allies."
Actually, the blow was to democracy. Zimbabwe needs land reform, but
the Mugabe government's encouragement of black settlers who seized
white farmland, sometimes killing the owners, is as despicable as
white colonists' eviction of blacks from the land last century.
Whites make up less than 1% of the population and still control an
estimated 70% of the best farmland. That ratio must change, but
owners must be compensated and settlers assisted in making the land
productive.</TE>
<TE>   The one-year suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth should
impress on Mugabe the anger of other countries at his intimidation
and disenfranchisement of opposition voters. African nations, which
like Zimbabwe were victims of colonialism, should keep pressing
Mugabe to enforce the rule of law and root out corruption in
government.</TE>
<TE>   Zimbabwe is rich in agricultural and human resources and was once
a good bet to shake off poverty. The sad tug of Mugabe's corruption
and demagoguery has brought it low, but the rest of southern Africa
need not sink with it.</TE>

<HD>Rosetta LeNoire, 90; Actress Founded Group for Multiracial
Productions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rosetta LeNoire, who surmounted tremendous physical hardships and
racism during a seven-decade career as an actress and theatrical
producer, died after a long illness Sunday at a hospital in Teaneck,
N.J. She was 90.</LD>
<LD>   The winner of a National Medal of Arts in 1999, LeNoire got her
start under the tutelage of two show-business legends, jazzman Eubie
Blake and dancing great Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, who was her
godfather.</LD>
<LD>   She went on to dance with Bojangles on Broadway and later
developed and produced shows such as "Bojangles" and the
Tony-nominated "Bubbling Brown Sugar." She also founded a theater
group that helped to pioneer multiracial productions and an acting
school for children in Harlem.</LD>
<TE>   Her career enjoyed a late-life bloom in television, where she won
the adoration of fans for her long-running role as Grandma Winslow on
the sitcom "Family Matters," which aired on ABC and CBS for 10 years
beginning in 1989. She also played Nell Carter's argumentative mother
in the NBC series "Gimme a Break."</TE>
<TE>   She was born in 1911 in New York's Hell's Kitchen. Her father was
an immigrant from the French West Indies and one of the first
licensed black plumbers and electrical engineers in New York state.
Her mother died of complications from giving birth to a younger
brother when a Harlem hospital refused to treat her because she was
black. The hospital later relented when an Irish policeman who went
to the same Catholic church intervened, but doctors left her in the
hallway, where she died of pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   LeNoire had been born with rickets, a crippling disease that
doctors treated by breaking the bones in both her legs and requiring
her to wear braces for 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   At 13, she began to study music with Blake, who became a close
friend and mentor. It was Blake, LeNoire often recounted, who taught
her to regard humanity the way he looked at his garden, to behold
people as "beautiful flowers of so many colors."</TE>
<TE>   At 15, LeNoire was tap-dancing in the chorus with Robinson, who
knew her father from the Elks Club and had convinced him that dancing
would strengthen her legs. She called him Uncle Bo, and he called her
Brown Sugar. "I worshipped him," she told the Toronto Star several
years ago. "He was the best dancer of all time. Period."</TE>
<TE>   At 25, she was performing the role of First Witch on the New York
stage in a landmark, all-black version of "Macbeth," directed by
Orson Welles. She remembered Welles for "treating everyone as equals"
at a time when such equality was far from common.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, in 1939, she made her Broadway debut in Mike
Todd's "The Hot Mikado," an all-black version of the Gilbert and
Sullivan opera that also starred her Uncle Bo. Other Broadway roles
followed in shows such as "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Blues for Mr.
Charlie" and "The Sunshine Boys."</TE>
<TE>   But she never forgot what it was like to be a struggling black
actress during the 1930s. She was traveling through the Deep South as
a member of a road company of "You Can't Take It With You" when she
saw what she thought was a group of people going to Christmas Mass.
It actually was an angry mob that had just lynched a black man
for--falsely, as it later turned out--raping a white girl. "Things
like that," she said, "never leave you."</TE>
<TE>   She played a maid in that show, a role she would repeat many times
during her long career. In later years, she would quip that she
played "every maid's role on Broadway." She endured some criticism of
her acceptance of such roles but defended her choices, saying she
always sought to "find the humanity underneath the stereotype."</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, she founded the AMAS Repertory Theatre (later renamed the
Rosetta LeNoire Musical Theatre), a nonprofit group dedicated to
nontraditional, colorblind casting. She also founded the Eubie Blake
Children's Theatre, to teach youths not only the rudiments of
performance but life skills. LeNoire provided hot lunches and taught
hygiene and nutrition while other teachers offered classes in
singing, acting and dancing.</TE>
<TE>   At AMAS, she oversaw the development of the musical "Bojangles"
and conceived "Bubbling Brown Sugar," which told the story of the
golden age of Harlem. The latter show moved to Broadway and to
London's West End and toured internationally.</TE>
<TE>   She acted in television soap operas such as "Guiding Light" and
"Another World" before landing a recurring role in "Gimme a Break"
and a regular role in "Family Matters." The sitcoms earned her a core
of fans who were so aggressive in their admiration that on two
separate occasions she ended up in a neck brace and an arm sling
after being hugged by them.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the National Medal of Arts, her honors include the
Paul Robeson Award from Actors' Equity Assn. and the Kennedy Center
Black Playwright's Award for excellence in developing new works.</TE>
<TE>   "I get lots of letters asking for my secret of longevity," she
said in 1992 when she 80.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell people I'm against retirement, I'm for God, I believe in
goodness and also luck."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include a son, William M. LeNoire; a sister, and two
brothers.</TE>

<HD>Maud Farris-Luse; Oldest Person at 115</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maud Farris-Luse, recognized last year by the Guinness Book of
Records as the world's oldest person, has died. She was 115.</LD>
<LD>   She died Monday from complications of pneumonia at a health center
in Coldwater, Mich., south of Grand Rapids, where she lived in a
nursing home. She had been hospitalized Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Farris-Luse was 115 years and 56 days old.</LD>
<TE>   "It was her time," said great-granddaughter Laurie Ferris, 32.
"She passed away very, very peacefully."</TE>
<TE>   In June, Guinness editors recognized Farris-Luse as the oldest
person whose age could be verified. Although her birth certificate
had been lost, the editors authenticated her age through other
documents, including U.S. Census Bureau records and her 1903 marriage
license.</TE>
<TE>   Described as sharp and fiercely independent, Farris-Luse lived
alone and cared for herself until she broke her hip in a 1991 fall at
her house. She then moved to the nursing home. She remained mentally
alert until about five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   By the time of her 115th birthday in January, relatives said, she
could not see or hear them or understand what was happening, but she
still seemed to enjoy visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "She was just a wonderful woman, loved her family, always happy,"
said Ferris, whose branch of the family uses that spelling instead of
Farris.</TE>
<TE>   Farris-Luse was born Jan. 21, 1887, in Morley, about 40 miles
north of Grand Rapids. She married Jason Farris, a farmer and
laborer, in 1903, when he was 24 and she was 16. They lived in
Angola, Ind., before moving to Coldwater in 1923. They had seven
children.</TE>
<TE>   Farris died at age 72 in 1951, when his wife was 64. She then
married Walter Luse, who died three years into their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Farris-Luse worked as a clerk in a factory, a
hotel maid, a baker and a restaurant cook, retiring in her 70s. She
outlived all but one of her children.</TE>
<TE>   The world's oldest woman is now 114-year-old Kamato Hongo of
Japan, which is also home to the world's oldest man, 112-year-old
Yukichi Chuganji, according Dr. Stephen Coles of UCLA, a member of
the Gerontology Research Group, which tracks information on people
documented to be 110 or older.</TE>

<HD>Van Tien Dung, 84; Led N. Vietnam in Capturing Saigon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gen. Van Tien Dung, who commanded the North Vietnamese forces that
captured Saigon in the final act of the Vietnam War, has died,
Vietnam's Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dung, 84, died Sunday at Hanoi's Central Military Hospital, said
ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh. The cause of death was not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   After a formal state funeral Thursday, Dung will be buried at the
Mai Dich Cemetery on the outskirts of Hanoi, reserved for the
highest-ranking Communist Party and government officials, Vietnam
Television announced.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Hanoi and a member of the Communist Party by the time he
was 20, Dung rose from peasant stock to become part of an elite
handful of revolutionaries who masterminded Vietnam's war of
independence against France.</TE>
<TE>   He was named Hanoi's military chief of staff in 1953 and went on
to fight against American forces during the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   Dung headed the final Communist offensive against U.S.-backed
South Vietnam in the spring of 1975. The war came to an end on April
30 of that year as North Vietnamese tanks rolled through the gates of
the Presidential Palace in Saigon, South Vietnam's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Dung's military reputation in Vietnam stands second only to
battlefield legend Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, who along with Ho Chi Minh
and Pham Van Dong were considered the architects of the nation's
communist revolution.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a surprisingly detailed and candid account of the
offensive leading to Saigon's collapse that was serialized in Hanoi's
leading newspapers in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Experts found the memoir, called "The Great Spring Victory,"
straightforward and reasonably accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Although Dung's chronicle broke no news, it was valuable because
it confirmed the U.S. government's theories about North Vietnamese
strategy during the final phase of the war.</TE>
<TE>   He revealed that North Vietnam's leaders did not expect the final
offensive to succeed as quickly as it did. He said he was incredulous
when hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese troops and civilians
fled from Pleiku in the Central Highlands--the beginning of the
conquest of the South.</TE>
<TE>   "Why such a retreat? And who had given the order for it?" he
asked, recording his thoughts at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Dung's memoir also read as lively military history because of
Dung's personal notes and descriptions of cloak-and-dagger maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   When the wary general departed for South Vietnam in 1975, for
example, he took pains to keep intelligence agents from noticing his
absence. Before leaving Hanoi, he arranged for a double to ride in
his Soviet Volga sedan for his regular twice-daily trips between his
house and military headquarters. He also arranged for an army
volleyball team to come to his house every afternoon "because I have
the habit of playing volleyball after the afternoon working hours
with them." The activities were reported in the Hanoi press as if he
were still there.</TE>
<TE>   The prominent play given to his memoirs made Dung a national hero
and signaled to analysts that the down-to-earth general was to be
elevated to the heroic stature of his mentor, Giap.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Giap was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease and by 1975 his
role had become largely ceremonial. Dung, the only other four-star
general in the North Vietnamese army, was credited by Western
military experts with overhauling and reorganizing North Vietnam's
army into a modern military force. In 1980, the year after Vietnam
toppled the government of neighboring Cambodia, he replaced Giap as
defense minister.</TE>
<TE>   In later years Dung was dogged by criticism from within the army
for his autocratic style and rumors of family corruption. He was
replaced in 1986 during a Cabinet shuffle.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his two sons and three daughters.</TE>

wrote that no one expected South Vietnam to collapse so quickly. "Why
such a retreat? And who had given the order for it?" he asked of the

<HD>Louise Mudd Arehart, 84; Kin of Notorious Physician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her name was Mudd, and she devoted much of her life to defending the
reputation of her notorious grandfather and ensuring that his
historic Maryland home was preserved.</LD>
<LD>   Louise Mudd Arehart, a granddaughter of the Maryland country
doctor who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg after he
assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, died of complications from a
stroke March 11 in La Plata, Md. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, charged as a conspirator in the assassination
of Lincoln, was sentenced to life in prison in 1865 by the military
court that tried the seven men and one woman accused of plotting to
kill the president.</LD>
<TE>   Mudd received a life sentence at the Ft. Jefferson prison on the
Dry Tortugas, an isolated group of keys 70 miles west of Key West.
But in 1869, after heroically saving the lives of prisoners and
guards during a yellow fever epidemic, Mudd was pardoned by President
Andrew Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Although the doctor was set free--he died of pneumonia in 1883 at
age 49--the debate over his guilt or innocence continues to this day,
and members of the Mudd family have spent decades trying to have the
government exonerate their forebear.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose he wouldn't have set Booth's leg. What would history have
said about him then?" Arehart once asked. "He took a Hippocratic oath
of service to humanity."</TE>
<TE>   Until the end, she remained a strong proponent of her
grandfather's innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "Vociferously, pugilistically," said Arehart's daughter-in-law,
Suzanne Cox. "You didn't want to mess with her on that. A lot of
politicians got tired of trying to deal with her. She would just wear
them down. She had super energy."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Arehart's energy over the last three decades went into the
preservation of the Dr. Samuel A. Mudd House, a two-story white frame
structure that was placed on the National Register of Historic Places
in 1983 and operates as a museum.</TE>
<TE>   The house on farmland near the town of Waldorf, about 20 miles
south of Washington, draws about 3,000 visitors a year from all over
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The restored home is decorated with period furnishings, some of
which are from the time the Mudds lived there, including the plush
red couch Booth sat on while Mudd tended to his broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of nine children, Arehart was born and raised in her
grandfather's house, which has always attracted curiosity seekers.
She once recalled that when people walked up to the door, her mother
would invite them in and give them a tour.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Arehart worked as a civilian in the Pentagon.
After the war, she ran a tourist home in Waldorf, served as a judge
in the Charles County Orphan's Court and worked in real estate.</TE>
<TE>   But in the late 1960s, a decade after moving to La Plata, she
began her campaign to preserve the old Mudd homestead 10 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   And, Arehart said, it was a ghostly visitor approaching her home
that motivated her.</TE>
<TE>   "This man was slender ... he had an old-fashioned brown coat and
cap on," she said. "I went to the front door so I could meet the man.
But he wasn't there. I also went outside, but there were no
footprints on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   After several more appearances she was convinced the mysterious
figure was her grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "One day I was just sitting in my living room, and it hit me. I
just had to make Grandpa's house a historical site that everyone
could appreciate," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, the Maryland Historic Trust bought the 10-acre property,
and four years later the state General Assembly appropriated $125,000
for restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Until she suffered a stroke in September, Arehart was a familiar
sight at the Mudd House, greeting visitors and escorting them through
the rooms as she told her grandfather's story.</TE>
<TE>   After shooting Lincoln in the presidential box at Ford's Theater
on April 14, 1865, Booth jumped onto the stage, snagging a spur in
the bunting and breaking his leg in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   An accomplice, David E. Herold, joined up with Booth in Maryland,
where they stopped at Mudd's house about 4 a.m. to have the
32-year-old doctor tend to Booth's leg.</TE>
<TE>   After setting, splinting and bandaging the leg, Mudd reportedly
asked his handyman to make crutches and sent the two men to an
upstairs bedroom to sleep. Late that afternoon, they left on
horseback.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven days later, Booth was shot and killed after being
surrounded in a barn by soldiers, and Herold surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd, a Confederate sympathizer, was no stranger to Booth; they
had met several times. But although some historians say the two met
on secret Confederate matters, Mudd's descendants and others say the
meetings were for innocent social and business reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd maintained that he did not recognize Booth, who used a false
name, because he was wearing false whiskers. The doctor also said he
didn't know about Lincoln's assassination until he went to town after
Booth had gone to bed.</TE>
<TE>   The next day at church Mudd reportedly asked a relative to tell
the authorities that two "strangers" had been at his home the day
before.</TE>
<TE>   Arehart's cousin, Richard D. Mudd, a 101-year-old former Saginaw,
Mich. physician, has led the long crusade to clear their
grandfather's name. He argues that the Military Commission had no
jurisdiction to try a civilian and that Samuel Mudd's conviction
should be set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Mudd recently won the right to appear before a federal
appeals court in Washington. A hearing date is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Arehart is survived by her two children, Shirley Cox Cook of
Wallingford, Pa., and Bernard Cox of La Plata; three sisters; seven
grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and six
great-great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Luise Rinser, 90; German Writer Survived Nazis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luise Rinser, a best-selling German writer who was imprisoned by the
Nazi regime and later ran for the West German presidency, has died.
She was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Rinser died Sunday, the Am Parksee senior home in Munich announced
Monday without giving further details.</LD>
<LD>   Born in 1911 in the Bavarian town of Pitzling, Rinser worked as a
teacher until 1939, when her refusal to join the Nazi Party or any
other Nazi organization resulted in her exclusion from public
employment.</LD>
<TE>   Her first book, "The Glass Rings," was published in 1941 and
chronicled a woman's struggle for self-discovery despite oppressive
social and familial forces. But the publication of a second edition
was blocked by Nazi authorities who thought it contained an antiwar
message. They also prevented two further novels from appearing.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1944, Rinser was arrested and sentenced to death on
charges of high treason and subverting Germany's military strength.
She was jailed at a prison for women in Traunstein and related her
experiences there in "A Woman's Prison Journal," which appeared in
1946, the year after the war ended.</TE>
<TE>   The book was one of only a few accounts of women's war experiences
to come out of World War II, and it remains one of the prolific
author's most significant works.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote the diary on scraps of toilet paper, which she hid in a
mattress until after the Nazi surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Her diary recorded tales of brutality by the prison guards and of
sisterhood among the inmates, who included an abortionist, an insane
young woman who had been in the Auschwitz death camp, and the wife of
an S.S. man who trumped up a charge against her so that he could
carry on an illicit affair in her absence.</TE>
<TE>   Rinser was a literary critic after World War II, then turned in
earnest to writing novels and stories. She achieved worldwide
attention with the 1950 novel "Mitte des Lebens," which later was
translated into English and published as "Nina." Among her other
novels were "Mirjam," "The Scapegoat" and "Daniela."</TE>
<TE>   She became increasingly involved in politics, working as a
campaign assistant for the center-left Social Democrats in the 1970s
under Chancellor Willy Brandt. In 1984, she ran as a presidential
candidate for the Greens Party, four years after it was founded by
anti-war and environmental activists.</TE>
<TE>   Rinser admired the late North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, traveling
to the isolated Communist country three times from 1980 to 1982 and
describing its version of socialism as "a model not just for the
Third World" in an account of her experiences there, "Diary of a
North Korean Journey."</TE>

to enter the Southern California market.</LD>
<LD>   HomeServices.com last month completed the purchase of the

of property. Homeservices.com now owns 11 brokerages. San Diego-based
Prudential California has 3,100 sales associates and 71 offices.</LD>

<HD>DDi Lowers Forecast For First Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DDi Corp., a maker of printed circuit boards and other electronic
parts, said its first-quarter loss will widen from the previous three
months as sales decline, missing its forecasts. The Anaheim company
said it expects to report a loss of 10 cents to 12 cents a share, on
sales of $61 million to $63 million.</LD>
<LD>   The electronics-equipment maker previously forecast that
first-quarter results would be comparable to the fourth quarter, when
it reported a loss of 7 cents on sales of $64.5 million. The firm
attributed the drop in sales to a "lengthening of average order lead
times."</LD>
<LD>   DDi shares closed at $11.79, down 4 cents, on Nasdaq before the
news was announced.</LD>

<HD>Testimony of Microsoft Rivals Limited</HD>
<DH>Courts: Kollar-Kotelly warns states not to expand the case
with new antitrust charges against software giant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a series of stern warnings Tuesday, the judge in the Microsoft
antitrust trial admonished the nine states suing the software giant
not to use the trial to establish new antitrust charges.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the purpose of the
proceedings was to determine only what penalties Microsoft Corp.
should face for its antitrust violations, not to expand the case with
new charges.</LD>
<LD>   "The plaintiffs are marching down a new liability path,"
Kollar-Kotelly said. "With some of the areas the plaintiffs are going
into, it is going to be a problem."</LD>
<TE>   The admonitions came just before the cross-examination of the
states' star witness, James L. Barksdale, the former president of
Microsoft archrival Netscape Communications Corp., a unit of AOL Time
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   As Barksdale was about to take the stand, Kollar-Kotelly excused
him and told attorneys for both sides that the former software
executive would not be allowed to speculate about whether a proposed
Microsoft antitrust settlement or harsher penalties against the
software company could better restore software competition.</TE>
<TE>   She also refused to allow Barksdale to discuss Microsoft's Windows
XP operating system.</TE>
<TE>   The states' lead trial lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., asked
Kollar-Kotelly for some latitude in witness testimony to help clarify
the states' demands for stiffer penalties against Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly did not reverse her stance. But she declined to
give any immediate benefit to Microsoft, whose lawyers asked her to
strike all the testimony of an earlier witness, Sun Microsystems Inc.
executive Richard Green.</TE>
<TE>   Green was questioned extensively about the alleged threat Sun's
Java programming language posed to Windows. After years of including
the programming language with Windows, Microsoft dropped Java support
in Windows XP--an act that states contend was anti-competitive.
Kollar-Kotelly said she would reserve a final decision on what, if
any, testimony to strike.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly's restrictions on witness testimony could hurt the
states' bid to seek tougher punishment. That's because much of their
case is forward-looking and concerns the anti-competitive effects of
Microsoft products introduced in the last few months, such as Windows
XP and .Net, an ambitious Microsoft e-commerce initiative that
critics fear could dominate the market for Web services.</TE>
<TE>   Barksdale and Green were put on the stand by the states to bolster
their arguments that Microsoft continues to violate antitrust laws
and therefore should face tougher antitrust sanctions than have been
proposed in a settlement with the Justice Department and nine other
states.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department accord would require Microsoft to allow PC
makers to install non-Microsoft products on Windows computers and
force the software giant to disclose some technical details about
Windows so software developers can make more compatible products.</TE>
<TE>   Dissenters California, Iowa, Utah, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Kansas, Florida, Minnesota, West Virginia and the District of
Columbia want Kollar-Kotelly to force Microsoft to create a
stripped-down version of the Windows software.</TE>

<HD>Bell-Boeing Team Gets Osprey Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bell-Boeing aerospace team has been awarded a $770-million
military contract to build 11 MV-22 Osprey helicopters in a
continuing test program for the tilt-rotor aircraft, the Defense
Department said.</LD>
<LD>   Work on the 11 big helicopters is expected to be completed in 2005
by the Bell Helicopter division of Textron Inc. and Boeing Co. in a
program that has been troubled by problems and fatal crashes.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon decided last year to continue low-rate production of
the aircraft, but to conduct a careful two-year testing program to
determine if the Marine Corps will buy as many as 360 Ospreys.</LD>
<TE>   The Marine Corps hopes the MV-22, which uses swivel engines to

<DL></DL>
<LD>Accenture Ltd. said it will take a $212-million quarterly charge to
ditch soured investments, and it plans a public offering of 100
million shares.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Bermuda-based company, which was spun off from
accounting firm Andersen, also said it expects operating results near
the high end of Wall Street estimates, investors shrugged off the
forecast and sent the stock down as much as 15%.</LD>
<LD>   Accenture said current and former partners will sell 89.8million
of the 100 million shares in the planned stock offering. The company
said the offering is designed to create a more liquid, orderly market
for its stock.</LD>
<TE>   Accenture, which took a $90-million charge in the fiscal first
quarter ended Nov. 30 to write down losses on its venture capital and
investment portfolio, said it will sell substantially all of its
minority-owned investments, including some stakes in companies with
which it worked.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Accenture were down $3.42, or 11.6%, at $26 in NYSE
trading.</TE>

<LD>Delta Air Lines Inc. said it will have a first-quarter loss of $350
million to $380 million because of higher insurance costs, spending
on security and lower fares after the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Delta disclosed the estimate, which excludes some costs, in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing without providing per-share
forecasts. Delta said it will have additional expenses of about $25
million for costs that include retraining and relocating pilots after
cutting capacity.</LD>
<LD>   The carrier's fifth straight quarterly loss would be about $2.84
to $3.08 a share, Buckingham Research analyst Helane Becker
estimated. That's wider than the average forecast of $2.64 in a
Thomson Financial/First Call poll.</LD>

<LD>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the largest U.S. household-goods maker, said
third-quarter profit will rise at least 10%, more than forecast
because of higher sales of Tide detergent and the purchase of the
Clairol hair-products business.</LD>
<LD>   The earnings increase meets Chief Executive A.G. Lafley's goal
ahead of his fiscal 2003 plan. Lafley has sold declining brands such
as Comet cleaner, entered growing markets such as hair tints and
eliminated 9,600 jobs to reduce costs and spur sales.</LD>

2000.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Clear Channel Communications Inc.'s planned purchase of a radio
station in Virginia is being challenged by the Federal Communications
Commission on claims that it reduces competition in the market.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC said it will hold a hearing on the matter, the first time
the agency has done so on market-concentration issues in a radio
station sale since 1969. Clear Channel's purchase of WUMX would
reduce the number of "effective" competitors in the Charlottesville
radio market to two from three, the FCC said.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel is the biggest owner of U.S. radio stations. The FCC
hearing comes after Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills) said the
Justice Department and the FCC should investigate allegations that
Clear Channel is using shell companies to exceed ownership limits.</LD>
<TE>   Clear Channel executives couldn't be reached to comment. Shares of
the San Antonio-based company fell 49 cents to $53.42 on the NYSE,
before the news was announced.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Chicago called a temporary halt to the music and
movie industries' legal assault on Madster, the online file-swapping
service formerly known as Aimster. The move came shortly after two of
the targets of the industries' copyright-infringement
lawsuit--BuddyUSA Inc. and AbovePeer Inc., which operate
Madster--filed for bankruptcy protection .</LD>
<LD>   Matt Oppenheim, an attorney at the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, predicted that Madster would meet the same fate as
song-sharing service Napster, which a federal judge in San Francisco
slapped with a pre-trial restraining order.</LD>
<LD>   Aimster creator Johnny Deep, who runs BuddyUSA and AbovePeer, said
the lawsuits and "unfair business practices" forced him to seek
protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Deep said he plans to defend
Madster by accusing the record companies of antitrust violations and
copyright misuse, just as Napster's lawyers have done.</LD>

<LD>Asia Global Crossing Ltd. officials say the communications company
will survive on its own, even if parent company Global Crossing Ltd.
never emerges from bankruptcy or is sold off in pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Executives of Bermuda-based Asia Global Crossing, which is facing
a cash shortfall of its own, are traveling across Asia this week to
reassure customers and investors and to line up new funding. A
spokeswoman for the company said talks with potential investors "are
ongoing and look promising."</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing, which owns 59% of Asia Global Crossing, filed for
bankruptcy protection in January, and its future is uncertain. The
two companies have been heavily interdependent, with overlapping
boards of directors, shared offices and interlocking customer deals.</LD>

<HD>No, the Signs in Parked Cars in New York Were Not a Protest
Against Radios</HD>

<LD>Mention was made here of a parked car in Hollywood with a handwritten
sign that said: "Please do not break window. I only carry liability."
This reminded James Janner of a not-so-bright acquaintance in New
York City who thought the "No Radio" signs in the windows of parked
cars were "a protest against radio in general." But hey, in this era
of talk radio, who could blame Janner's friend?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Stupid criminal tricks: A landlord phoned police after noticing a
trespasser in a Manhattan Beach apartment. The cops had no trouble
locating the guy, the Beach Reporter newspaper said. After he
realized he had been noticed by the landlord, the intruder locked
himself inside one of the units.</LD>

important advice for those of you who buy pizzas at the supermarket

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Reseda, what? Despite the recent discussion here of
references to Reseda in the movies, the mysterious Phil of Westwood
feels it's strange how infrequently the local suburbs crop up in film
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the best he could come up with of late was a line on
the HBO series "Six Feet Under." A mortician says, "Well, I've got to
go to Torrance." Of course, Torrance (or the Del Amo shopping center,
at least) had its moment of fame in the crime caper "Jackie Brown" a
few years ago. Money-laundering stewardess Pam Grier tells an
associate, "Now the money's going to be in the Del Amo shopping bag
at this booth. Sit down here in the food court." You can't get much
more suspenseful than that.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was "Boogie Nights," in which porno actor wannabe Mark
Wahlberg is snidely addressed by director Burt Reynolds as "Eddie
Adams from Torrance." Eddie takes the bus from the South Bay to the
San Fernando Valley studio each day (as if that's possible). Oh,
yeah, the studio's in Reseda. I can't seem to stop talking about
Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mystery of the day: There are so many public signs prohibiting
this or that these days. Babs Woodcock of Rancho Palos Verdes saw one
on Catalina Island that read, NO KELING.</TE>
<TE>   "We were mystified as to what 'keling' was," she said. "We asked
some kids playing basketball nearby. They had no idea. Asked locals.
Asked passersby. Asked a parked police car. No one had a clue.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, about to board the return boat, we ran into a Harbor
Department officer and she solved the puzzle. The sign was supposed
to read SNORKELING." Vanna White could have told her that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: William Dorr of L.A. received a junk mailing from a
psychic who promised "an in-depth personal reading to clarify the
events of the next few days of your life." Dorr has some doubts about
the "personal" nature of the psychic's research. The letter was
addressed to "Wendy Dorr," no acquaintance of William Dorr.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market should consider
prohibiting corporations from donating money to institutions that
have ties to corporate audit committee members, a top Securities and
Exchange Commission official said.</LD>
<LD>   SEC Chief Accountant Robert Herdman said that, in the wake of
Enron Corp.'s collapse, regulators for the two leading U.S. markets
also should weigh a proposal to stop audit board members from doing
consulting work for companies they oversee.</LD>
<LD>   NYSE and Nasdaq are reviewing their listing requirements about
audit committees as part of a broader look at corporate governance
requested by SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.</LD>
<TE>   Herdman made his comments in a speech delivered March 7 and only
recently released them.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE has appointed a panel to look at corporate governance
issues. A Nasdaq spokeswoman said Nasdaq was "examining closely the
issues mentioned by Mr. Herdman, as well as other corporate
governance issues."</TE>

<HD>High Court Favors Companies in Family and Medical Leave
Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A divided U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal rule that
penalized employers for failing to inform workers of their rights
under the Family and Medical Leave Act.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor Department rule was aimed at employers that don't tell
workers on leave that the time will count against the 12 weeks of
guaranteed leave under federal law.</LD>
<LD>   The rule gave those employees an additional 12 weeks off.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the 5-4 court in a case
from Arkansas, called that penalty "disproportionate and inconsistent
with Congress' intent."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was part of a mixed day for employers at the nation's
highest court. In a separate ruling, the justices unanimously made it
easier for workers to file job-bias complaints at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The justices concluded that a worker who files an EEOC complaint
without submitting it under oath as required can correct the error
after the deadline for the claim has expired.</TE>
<TE>   In the family leave case, employer groups argued the Labor
Department rule punished companies for providing benefits beyond
those mandated by federal law.</TE>
<TE>   It was the court's first ruling to address the scope of the 1993
Family and Medical Leave Act.</TE>
<TE>   "This regulation discouraged companies from providing more
generous leave policies than the FMLA requires," said lawyer Ann
Elizabeth Reesman, who filed a brief in the case for the Equal
Employment Advisory Council, an employer trade group.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires employers to give workers up to 12 weeks of
unpaid leave during a one-year period to take care of a newborn or a
sick relative or to deal with their own serious health condition.</TE>
<TE>   Workers' advocates said the ruling leaves companies with little
incentive to tell employees about those rights.</TE>
<TE>   "You now have a situation as a result of this case where employees
may not be able to rely on what they're being told because there's
really no penalty for screwing it up," said Paula A. Brantner of
Workplace Fairness.</TE>
<TE>   The case involved Tracy Ragsdale, an Arkansas woman who worked at
a factory owned by Wolverine World Wide Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Ragsdale took 30 weeks of leave to be treated for cancer and then
sought additional time off.</TE>
<TE>   Ragsdale argued that she was entitled to an additional 12 weeks
because the company didn't designate the leave she took under the
Family and Medical Leave Act.</TE>
<TE>   Ragsdale sued the company and the federal court sided with
Wolverine.</TE>

<HD>Judge Delays Review on Gemstar Patent Infringement Claim</HD>
<DH>Courts: Case involving interactive TV programming guides is
delayed by three months, until June 21.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BERKOWITZ and SUE ZEIDLER</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. said Tuesday that a judge
representing the International Trade Commission had extended by three
months his review of a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Gemstar,
until June 21.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar shares, already down sharply on a disappointing earnings
report Monday, plummeted further on the news. The shares dropped
$5.69, or 26% to a 52-week low of $16.04 in Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the delay could complicate Gemstar's pending deals
with major cable companies and put off any recovery of damages from a
parallel federal civil suit for another quarter at least.</LD>
<TE>   The ITC's initial determination in the case, filed last year by
Pasadena-based Gemstar against EchoStar Communications Corp.,
Scientific-Atlanta Inc., Pioneer Corp. and SCI Systems Inc., had been
expected by Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar alleges that various products made or sold by those
companies infringe Gemstar's numerous patents for television
interactive programming guides.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call Monday to discuss the company's
fourth-quarter results, Gemstar Chief Executive Henry Yuen said a
favorable ruling from the ITC could mean a double- or triple-digit
percentage increase in revenue from "catch-up" license fee payments
from the respondents.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot infer which way [the judge is] going to rule from his
request for more time," said John Corcoran, an analyst with CIBC
World Markets.</TE>
<TE>   "He's merely indicated he's not ready yet ... however, it is also
true that there are service providers waiting in the wings to see how
the judge will rule before dealing with Gemstar," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-February, administrative law Judge Paul Luckern, who is
hearing the claim on behalf of the ITC, took the case under
advisement without closing arguments, driving Gemstar stock higher in
what analysts said reflected investors' assumption he had already
decided how to rule.</TE>
<TE>   It was at that time that Luckern said he would rule in late March.</TE>
<TE>   Before the announcement of the ITC delay, Gemstar shares had been
down more than 16%, after posting fourth-quarter results Monday that
some analysts called disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney, SoundView Technology Group and CIBC lowered
their ratings on the stock Tuesday and many brokerages cut earnings
estimates for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the disappointing results, Gemstar also said Monday that
its co-president, Peter Boylan, had resigned, and that it would take
a $5-billion charge in the current quarter for the write-down of
goodwill related to its July 2000 $14-billion acquisition of TV
Guide.</TE>

<HD>GM Outlines Plans for Spending Cuts</HD>
<DH>Autos: The company is trying to boost profit even as
vehicle prices are expected to fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp., the only U.S. auto maker to turn a profit in
2001, plans to reduce spending by at least $4.3 billion this year to
boost earnings as vehicle prices fall and health-care costs rise.</LD>
<LD>   The largest auto maker will reduce about $1 billion from capital
spending, $2 billion from its North American material costs and
$1.3billion from manufacturing, engineering and health-care budgets,
executives said. The company may sell some unspecified operations
outside its main auto business, Chief Financial Officer John Devine
said.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors is trying to boost profit even as vehicle prices
decline an average 1% a year. The company is contending with higher
retiree health-care costs and has said it will have to inject $2
billion into its pension plan next year.</LD>
<TE>   "All of these efforts will help us meet our goal of earning $10 a
share mid-decade," said Gary Cowger, president of North American
operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit-based company's shares fell 28 cents to $60.83 on the
New York Stock Exchange and have risen 25% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company will reduce its capital spending by $1 billion to $7.1
billion without cutting any new products, Devine said. He said the
company isn't yet ready to discuss businesses it may sell.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors will trim unscheduled overtime, review its
health-care plan and cut waste in its engineering division to reduce
costs, Cowger told analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Cowger said he wants to reduce vehicle operations costs by about
$300 million, mostly by reducing unscheduled overtime that occurs
when there's a problem on an assembly line. Last year, the company
cut about $250 million in unscheduled overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker plans to reduce its $58 billion in annual material
spending by 3.5% by cutting content from vehicles, asking suppliers
for price reductions and trimming parts engineering costs, said Bo
Andersson, vice president of worldwide purchasing.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors will hold suppliers, engineers and vehicle-line
executives responsible for bottom-line costs, instead of separating
costs into categories such as engineering and materials that are
measured separately.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com, the leading home-sale listings provider on the Web,
announced Tuesday that it has agreed to sell ConsumerInfo .com, its
online consumer credit-reporting division, to credit-checking company
Experian for $130 million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   Experian, based in the United Kingdom and Orange, Calif., sells
access to personal credit reports and advice on managing credit and
debt, and has annual sales of $1.5billion. It is a subsidiary of GUS,
Europe's biggest catalog-shopping company.</LD>
<LD>   Experian said it hopes to expand its American presence by
purchasing ConsumerInfo.com, the biggest U.S. supplier of online
credit reports. Established in 1995, the company has provided credit
reports to more than 2 million customers. Its membership swelled to
778,000, from 492,000 a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   The ConsumerInfo.com sale comes at a pivotal time for Westlake
Village-based Homestore, which last week announced that it had
improperly recorded $41.4 million of revenue in 2000. The restatement
caused its loss for that year to balloon 27%, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore shares closed at $1.96 on Nasdaq, up 46 cents, after the
news was announced. They had dropped 93% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to be generating positive cash flow from
operations by the end of the year, a spokeswoman said. Homestore
continues to earn revenue from advertising and subscription fees.</TE>
<TE>   The sale also is consistent with Homestore's objective of
concentrating on its "core constituents," primarily agents, brokers
and home builders.</TE>
<TE>   "This transaction divests Homestore of a business that is not
central to our real estate focus," the company said.</TE>

<HD>Levi's Sales Continue Decline in 1st Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KAHN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. said Tuesday that lower interest costs and foreign
exchange boosted quarterly net income, but operating profit declined
as sales fell just as they have for the last five years.</LD>
<LD>   The privately held company, one of the world's largest apparel
makers, said sales dipped 6% to $935million in its fiscal first
quarter, ended Feb. 24, from $996 million a year ago. Net income,
including taxes and interest, rose 47% to $44 million. But operating
income fell 13% to $106 million.</LD>
<LD>   Even with the decline, Levi Strauss Chief Executive Phil Marineau
said the firm's turnaround plan was on track, reiterating that the
company would stabilize sales by the end of its fiscal year and see
its business grow during 2003.</LD>
<TE>   "We are in good shape relative to the plans that we set for
ourselves and the turnaround is on track," Marineau said. "The second
quarter will be bumpy but we don't expect it to get in the way of the
overall results for the year."</TE>
<TE>   The results come as the San Francisco-based company, which reports
earnings because of its outstanding corporate debt, battles to
restore its faded image in the face of competition from other brands
that have cut into a once-dominant market share.</TE>
<TE>   In the bid to reposition its clothing for younger customers,
Marineau said, the firm will do away with some fits and styles to
make it less confusing for consumers to decide what kind of Levi's to
buy.</TE>
<TE>   The company also will try to add a little zip to the brand with a
new stain-resistant khaki, Superlow stretch jeans for women and
low-rise jeans for men.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agreed that the company faces a potentially rough ride in
the first part of this year but said the Levi Strauss management team
was on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is moving in the right direction to achieving its
stabilization initiatives, and investors should not be distracted by
short-term hiccups," said James-Scott Wong, an analyst at Barclays
Capital in London.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also hopes the recent launch of low-rise jeans for men
and women in Asia will beef up revenue where sales dipped 4.7% to
$73.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although company officials were heartened by rising sales in
Europe and Asia on a constant currency basis, the main problem for
the firm seems to be in the Americas, where sales fell 9.2%, to
$601million.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Strauss aims to emulate the model it pioneered in
Europe--where the company said sales rose for the fourth consecutive
quarter--by focusing on the most popular fits and styles and
improving retail presentation.</TE>
<TE>   This means, for example, getting rid of the traditional "wall of
jeans" to display clothing more prominently both in retail outlets
and Levi Strauss' own stores--a revamping CEO Marineau said has
sparked better sales.</TE>
<TE>   The company said its debt was largely unchanged during the quarter
at $1.96 billion. Marineau said the firm is committed to using free
cash flow to pay down debt, with a goal of getting the firm back to
an investment-grade rating in the next few years.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed mostly higher Tuesday, though key indexes ended below
their levels reached just before the Federal Reserve's midday
announcement on interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   The market was helped by upbeat profit projections from some major
firms.</LD>
<LD>   Longer-term bond yields edged lower after the Fed, as expected,
kept its benchmark short-term rate stable at a 40-year low of 1.75%,
while also signaling that it may raise rates later this year.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a gain
of 57.50 points, or 0.5%, to a nine-month high of 10,635.25, after
rallying as high as 10,673 shortly before the Fed's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite gained 3.81 points, or 0.2%, to 1,880.87,
after reaching 1,891.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stocks continued to lead the market: The Standard &amp; Poor's
index of 600 smaller shares rose 0.5% to a record high of 247.41.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 17 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 18 to 17 on Nasdaq. Volume was subdued.</TE>
<TE>   Traders said they weren't surprised stocks sold off modestly after
the Fed's announcement provided no surprises. They noted that the
market has been strong in recent weeks even as expectations have
risen that the Fed is moving closer to tightening credit, given the
economy's rebound.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank said it shifted its "bias" on rates to
neutral--meaning that it no longer believes that the greatest risk to
the economy is of further weakness.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every market strategist coming into this had said the Fed
would go to a more neutral posture and leave rates unchanged, and
that's exactly what happened," said Bill Barker, analyst at RBC Dain
Rauscher.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, where longer-term yields have surged in recent
weeks amid better-than-expected economic data, investors seemed
calmed by the tone of the Fed's statement. Bond investors "like the
Fed's statement because it gives no hint the central bank needs to
raise rates as early as May," said Cary Leahey, economist at Deutsche
Bank Securities.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note eased to 5.29% from 5.30% Monday.
The yield was as high as 5.33% before the Fed ended its meeting. The
yield on two-year T-notes ended at 3.54%, down from 3.59% Monday and
down from 3.63% before the Fed's statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed is not going to go too fast, and probably won't raise
rates until the middle of the summer," said Vinny Verterano, a bond
trader at Nomura Securities International.</TE>
<TE>   In the stock market, many investors are betting that rebounding
corporate earnings this year will offset any damage caused by higher
interest rates. That view got an assist Tuesday as several major
companies said near-term earnings will beat expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Procter &amp; Gamble jumped $2.28 to $89.94 after the
consumer-products giant said fiscal third-quarter profit will rise at
least 10%, more than forecast, because of higher sales of Tide
detergent and the purchase of the Clairol hair-products business.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage Goldman Sachs gained $1.85 to $91.05 after it reported a
smaller-than-expected 32% drop in fiscal first-quarter profit and
said business is beginning to pick up.</TE>
<TE>   Timken, a maker of bearings and specialty steel, soared $2.28 to
$21.97. The company said it will have an unexpected first-quarter
profit and full-year profit higher than estimates, helped by rising
sales and cost cuts.</TE>
<TE>   On the downside, the telecom sector continued to weaken. Many
investors are giving up hope that the sector can show a profit
rebound this year. Lucent Technologies sank 48 cents to $4.30, a new
record low. Nortel Networks dropped 12 cents to $4.54, and Nokia was
off 68 cents to $21.73.</TE>

<HD>Round 3 in Legislative Battle Between Artists, Labels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM WASSERMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A fight between recording artists and their music labels continued
before the state Senate on Tuesday, offering an inside view of
economics and tensions in a troubled industry.</LD>
<LD>   Singer Don Henley of the Eagles and others intent on ending
binding long-term contracts in the recording industry battled
publicly a third time with entertainment executives who said labor
law changes would "make a bad situation worse."</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Judiciary Committee is a first hurdle for a legislative
proposal aiming to overhaul the music business. Votes aren't expected
until May.</LD>
<TE>   A bill by Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) would force record
companies to ban contracts longer than seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The record industry, because of a 1987 amendment to state labor
law, is unique in California for the limitless time it can hold
workers to a contract.</TE>
<TE>   John Branca, a Los Angeles agent who has represented musical acts
including Michael Jackson and Aerosmith, told committee members that
the industry holds unfair advantage over young performers.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the artist is handed a take-it-or-leave-it contract
for up to seven albums with a company where all the executives may
turn over during the length of that contract and the company is sold
two or three times," Branca said.</TE>
<TE>   Artists say it frequently takes up to 15 years to turn out the
industry-standard seven-album contract.</TE>
<TE>   But executives of a business in which five global corporations
control about 80% of the market said they must retain successful
performers to cover the losses of many musical acts that fail.</TE>
<TE>   Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, said superstars "want to be able to walk away from the
contracts they negotiated, contracts that were negotiated by the most
experienced and sophisticated lawyers and agents in the country, and
renege on the commitments they made.</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds unfair," she said, "because it is."</TE>
<TE>   Murray's bill must pass this year and be signed by the governor to
become law. Gov. Gray Davis has not indicated a position.</TE>

<HD>Cracks Found in B-2 Bombers</HD>
<DH>Defense: Air Force's discovery and a Pentagon report
calling aircraft high-maintenance could delay reopening of Palmdale
production line.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY CAPACCIO</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sixteen of 21 U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bombers have cracks as long
as nine inches on their specialized skins near the engine exhaust.</LD>
<LD>   Similar cracks showed up during 1990 development testing, and
maker Northrop Grumman Corp. and the Air Force thought they had been
fixed, said Air Force Secretary James Roche. The service--which said
it spent $200 million on patching and design changes--expects the
cracks to show up on all the bombers.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure comes as a new Pentagon report says the bomber
spends so much time in maintenance that availability for combat is
barely half what it should be.</LD>
<TE>   All this is bad news for congressional supporters who want to
reopen Northrop's Palmdale production line, an analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Air Force decides it wants to reopen the B-2 line, it will
have to prove convincingly to Congress that technology and processes
have advanced sufficiently to ameliorate these [maintenance]
problems," said Christopher Bolkcom, a military aircraft analyst for
the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. "It wouldn't surprise
me to see B-2 opponents seize on the crack issue in their attempts to
keep the line closed."</TE>
<TE>   "The B-2 has been overshadowed by the B-1 and B-52 in Operation
Enduring Freedom, and Secretary Roche has publicly said he doesn't
support restarting the B-2 line," Bolkcom said.</TE>
<TE>   The B-2 was Northrop Grumman's most profitable defense program
even as it was cut from 132 aircraft to 75 and then in the early
1990s to 21. Northrop delivered its last B-2 in 2000 when the program
generated $750 million in revenue. Chairman Kent Kresa said last year
that the company could reopen the line and start delivering the first
of 40 additional B-2s by 2006 if the Pentagon approved.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman's Integrated Systems Sector makes the bomber.
Boeing Co. is the top subcontractor; General Electric Co. produces
its engines.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to reopen the line has some strong supporters in
Congress, including Rep. Norman D. Dicks (D-Wash.), who stresses the
plane's ability to fly 30- and 40-hour missions from the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Dicks pressed his case last week during a hearing of the House
defense appropriations subcommittee with the Defense Department's top
acquisition official, Edward "Pete" Aldridge.</TE>
<TE>   Aldridge said the Pentagon's arguments against reopening the line
include the aircraft's dated, 1980s technology, an ongoing study of
developing an unmanned B-3 bomber, and the extensive maintenance it
takes to keep the B-2 flying.</TE>
<TE>   A new report from Pentagon Director for Operational Test &amp;
Evaluation Thomas Christie says B-2s were available for combat only
31% of the time on average in 2001, a "significant decline" from a
37% rate in 2000. The Air Force standard is 60%.</TE>
<TE>   The B-2's low rate is caused by "poor reliability and
maintainability" from the numerous hours required to restore the
bomber's delicate composite skin after hours of flying and a shortage
of qualified maintenance personnel required to do the job. Christie's
report doesn't mention the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman spokesman James Hart said the company is studying
the cracks issue. Roche probably will be asked about it today during
a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the fiscal 2003
budget.</TE>
<TE>   The cracks are worrisome because the Air Force doesn't know their
long-term effect on the B-2 fleet or whether they signify an
undiscovered problem with the bomber's stealth components, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The cracks on the $2.2-billion bat-winged bomber are located on
the titanium "aft deck" behind the aircraft's engine exhausts and
cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   "The cracks can be seen with the unaided eye," the service said.</TE>
<TE>   In July, when seven planes had cracks, the Air Force said it
applied "containment and prevention techniques" that reduced the
occurrence of new cracks and reduced the growth of existing ones. "A
long-term solution is in the works," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Nine more bombers developed cracks after that statement.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman shares rose $3.07 to $111.82 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Orbitz Examined for Anti-Competitive Practices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD FOSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The government is moving forward with its investigation of online
travel company Orbitz, which has been under scrutiny for potentially
anti-competitive behavior since its inception nine months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Department last week asked Chicago-based Orbitz
to provide confidential documents pertaining to its business plans
and contracts. The agency's request in a letter dated March 12 also
extended to the five airlines that own Orbitz, its business partners
and several competitors.</LD>
<LD>   "We seek to determine whether the terms of participation in Orbitz
are unreasonably restricting competition in the airline and airline
distribution businesses," said the letter, which was signed by the
agency's assistant secretary for Aviation and International Affairs,
Read C. Van de Water.</LD>
<TE>   A copy of the letter was obtained by the Associated Press late
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz, which was launched last June with $145 million in seed
money from five major airlines, has been accused by its competitors
of trying to reduce, if not eliminate, competition and pave the way
for higher airfares.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors such as Travelocity.com Inc. and Expedia Inc. have
asserted that Orbitz's owners--American, Continental Airlines, Delta
Air Lines, Northwest and United--withhold from them certain "Web
fares," the heavily discounted tickets promoted on their own Internet
sites.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz has access to all of its owners' Web fares, while
Travelocity and Expedia have access to just some.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Orbitz, Gary Doernhaefer, said Orbitz welcomed the
investigation and that its competitors accusations are "patently
false."</TE>
<TE>   Doernhaefer said if the government were to mandate that all Web
fares be sold through all channels, the result would be higher
distribution costs and higher air fares.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz's argument is that it has struck more deals with airlines
for Web fares because it offers a cheaper distribution channel than
its competitors. Orbitz says it saves airlines about 30% on each
transaction compared with other travel agents or Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier investigation into Orbitz, which was completed by the
Transportation Department before the company's launch, found no
evidence of monopolistic intentions. The new review will compare the
operations of Orbitz and its competitors and look into the nature of
the contracts between the airlines and the Web sites.</TE>

<HD>Fed's Stance Is a Boon for Consumers--for Now</HD>
<DH>Economy: Short-term borrowing costs pegged to the prime
rate should stay low for a while.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By leaving its key short-term interest rate alone for now, the
Federal Reserve is doing a favor for millions of consumers with
home-equity and credit card rates pegged to the prime lending rate.</LD>
<LD>   The stronger economy already has boosted other interest rates,
reflecting investors' belief that demand for loans will rise and that
inflation--a tame 1.6% last year--could reemerge. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury bond is up more than a percentage point
since early November, to 5.29% on Tuesday. And mortgage buyer Freddie
Mac says the rate on a standard 30-year home loan has risen from
6.45% to 7.08% during the same period.</LD>
<LD>   But the prime rate--the interest rate banks charge their best
customers and the benchmark for many types of short-term
loans--remains 4.75%, three percentage points above the federal funds
target rate, the Fed's key short-term rate. And that should help keep
short-term borrowing costs near their current low levels, at least
for now.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed, which lowered the federal funds rate 11 times last year
to stimulate the economy, left it unchanged Tuesday at 1.75%, the
40-year low where it has been since Dec. 11.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Fed also shifted its stance on the economy to
"neutral," meaning it believes the outlook is evenly balanced between
recession and excessive growth. By shifting its so-called bias, the
Fed signaled it may raise rates if the economy continues to heat up,
and economists expect several increases during the second half of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   A rate increase would raise the current rock-bottom rates for home
equity lines of credit, which have boomed in popularity as home
prices have risen, allowing more people to borrow against the value
of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve statistics show home-equity lending at commercial
banks has risen more than 60% since the end of 1999. For borrowers
with strong credit, most of those loans have interest rates one to
one and a half percentage points above prime--meaning in the 6% range
currently, compared to 10.5% to 11% when the Fed began cutting rates
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Banks could raise the prime rate even if the Fed doesn't make any
increases, but that's highly unlikely, industry experts said. Rick
Hartnack, vice chairman of Union Bank, said it's also unlikely that
many banks will increase their rates on home-equity loans until the
Fed makes a move. Even though other rates are rising, the home-equity
business is highly competitive, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Bankers Assn. says about half of credit cards also
have variable interest rates based on the prime rate. But credit card
customers have benefited far less from low short-term rates.</TE>
<TE>   Many card issuers didn't match the final Fed rate cuts last year
because their cards have interest rate floors. Though consumer
advocates complain of price gouging, the issuers contend they need
the minimum rates because of high marketing and administrative costs
and the fact that delinquencies rise during economic downturns.</TE>
<TE>   "Many companies had seen those floors reached last year and
stopped lowering their rates," said Lynn Reaser, senior economist for
Banc of America Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   Credit card rates already have started inching up along with
nearly all other credit types, said David Littman, chief economist
for Comerica Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Reaser and economist Doug Duncan of the Mortgage Bankers Assn.
expect fixed-rate mortgages to climb to 7.5% by year end, an increase
that mainly will affect refinancings. A record $1.1trillion in home
loans were refinanced last year as interest rates plummeted, a level
expected to fall to $600 billion this year, Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the volume of mortgages used to purchase homes is
expected to remain about the same as last year: $900 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Robert Goodman of Putnam Investments said that even if
mortgage rates hit 8%, they'll still be a great deal. After
accounting for the tax benefits and the fact that housing prices are
rising more than 5% a year in most parts of the country, the effect
for homebuyers "is as if the cost of borrowing is zero," he said.</TE>

<HD>FDA Panel Rejects Cold Drug Picovir</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The medication by ViroPharma is found to
have significant potential dangers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. advisory panel on Tuesday rejected one of two treatments for
the common cold that are in the development pipeline. The drug, from
ViroPharma Inc., was rejected, according to the Food and Drug
Administration panel, because its modest health benefits were
outweighed by significant potential dangers.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's advice.</LD>
<LD>   That development probably means good news for Pfizer Inc.'s Global
Research &amp; Development/La Jolla Laboratories, which is testing a drug
originally developed by Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc. in La Jolla, now
a Pfizer unit.</LD>
<TE>   Picovir, the first drug to attack the cause of the common cold and
not its symptoms, cut the illness short by about one day, according
to ViroPharma's own studies.</TE>
<TE>   The drug, co-developed by Aventis Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. unit of
French company Aventis,  came in pill form and was to be taken within
24 hours of the start of symptoms. Treatment lasts five days.</TE>
<TE>   Picovir, according to company literature, works by attacking
so-called picornaviruses, the family of viruses believed responsible
for more than half of all colds. The drug prevents the viruses from
copying themselves and infecting healthy cells.</TE>
<TE>   But the panel voted 15 to 0 to urge the FDA to decline Picovir,
known generically as pleconaril, because of the danger that it could
increase resistance to some viral infections in users and might
result in excessive menstrual bleeding in women.</TE>
<TE>   FDA staff reviewers said they also were concerned that the drug
might be linked to a racing heart rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Two unplanned pregnancies that occurred during the human trials
also might have been related to interactions between Picovir and
contraceptive pills.</TE>
<TE>   ViroPharma's situation is difficult because of the lopsided vote
and because a treatment for a simple illness needs a clean safety
record during trials.</TE>
<TE>   "The chances of FDA overturning the panel's recommendations are
very small," said Dr. Sushant Kumar, an analyst with Mehta Partners
in New York. "The most sensible approach would be to determine
whether ongoing studies are sufficient to answer some of these
concerns or whether new studies are needed."</TE>
<TE>   Kumar said that ViroPharma, particularly with the backing of
Aventis, "has a good amount of cash" and the resources to keep the
fight for the drug alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to see how salvageable the program is and how
long it might take," Kumar said.</TE>
<TE>   FDA rejection would leave ViroPharma without any prospective drugs
in advanced development.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the company, as high as $40 in May, have been trading
around $13. Trading was halted Tuesday during the panel's
deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Medical researchers have expressed hope about Picovir and Pfizer's
treatment, in part because they could reduce the need for
antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. James Cherry, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at
Mattel Childrens Hospital at UCLA, was a consultant to ViroPharma
during the development of Picovir and said that he had been impressed
with the drug's ability to arrest fever and other major symptoms of
viral meningitis. Cherry added that the drug appeared to be safely
effective for that use.</TE>
<TE>   But Cherry said, "antivirals aren't easy. We're not at all close
to being as effective in their use as a form of treatment as
penicillin, for example, in which a person feels better in just one
day. Antivirals are nowhere near as clear-cut and as rapid."</TE>
<TE>   The other cold-fighting drug is Pfizer's AG7088, a protease
inhibitor similar to the drugs that revolutionized AIDS treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The protease inhibitor halted the action of a key enzyme that the
virus needs to replicate in at least 100 strains of the common cold,
according to Pfizer.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer's drug, a nasal spray that is inhaled several times daily,
is still in the second stage of human testing, said Kim Simon, a
Pfizer spokesman.</TE>

<HD>No Panic Button for Houston Over Compaq</HD>
<DH>Economy: City officials say they will adjust to the local
firm's proposed merger with Hewlett-Packard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A home-grown company whose seeds were planted by three engineers
conspiring at a pie shop in 1982, Compaq Computer Corp. has
represented the future for Houston's economy, one that's connected to
the shiny world of information technology and not solely dependent on
the boom-and-bust cycles of oil.</LD>
<LD>   So when the announcement came in September that Compaq intended to
merge with Hewlett-Packard Co., the psychological setback was
palpable. Compaq would lose its name, relinquish its headquarters to
California and probably lose hundreds of jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Six months later, however, Houston has recovered from the blow to
its ego and come to realize that the company would not disappear
overnight, even if its fire-engine-red logo does.</LD>
<TE>   "The issue is more related to prestige than actual jobs," said
Barton Smith, economics professor and director of the Institute for
Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "Compaq has got an employment base of 10,000 in an economy of 2.1
million workers. Houston has created 60,000 jobs a year. So if we
were to lose half the remaining employment base at Compaq, you're
talking about less than one-tenth of the jobs we create in a single
year. Now, that's not trivial, but that's nowhere near disastrous."</TE>
<TE>   Compaq, Houston's 10th-largest employer, eliminated 2,000 jobs in
the city last year, about a fifth of the company's worldwide layoffs.
As part of the merger, 10% of the combined workforce would be axed in
pursuit of $2.5 billion in cost cutting. In Houston, that would mean
roughly 1,000 jobs lost.</TE>
<TE>   Houston certainly has seen worse. The oil bust of the mid-1980s
laid to waste 225,000 jobs. The bankruptcy of Enron Corp. has left
4,000 jobless. Continental Airlines slashed 2,000 jobs in Houston
last year to cope with the slump in air travel.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean Houston can shrug off the effects of a merger.
In the last two decades, the city went on a tear to diversify its
economy, and Compaq played a vital role in helping to pitch the city
as a hospitable place for technology companies to do business.</TE>
<TE>   "They were our headliner, our banner when we recruited companies,"
said Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership. "In
1982, 80% of the economy here was energy related. Today, it's about
45%. From technology to services to manufacturing, a number of
companies have come here as a result of Compaq."</TE>
<TE>   Although the merged company's presence in the city probably would
remain substantial, the loss of its headquarters would be a blow to
the city's efforts to attract new business.</TE>
<TE>   "It would remove one from the quiver of arrows the city can use,"
said Dennis Adams, professor at the University of Houston Bauer
School of Business. Between the Enron fiasco, the high-profile
child-drowning trial of Andrea Yates and a flood last June that left
more than $1 billion in damages, "Houston has not had great press
lately. Compaq would just be one more thing. Those perceptions are
hard to override in corporate boardrooms across the country."</TE>
<TE>   Compaq is still a major player in this city of 4.4 million. Compaq
Center is home to the city's basketball and hockey teams. The company
donates $50,000 a year to Houston's Alley Theatre. It sponsors the
city's marathon. It has contributed half a million dollars each year
to the Texas chapter of the United Way. Its employees volunteer in
all manner of charities, from Habitat for Humanity to Star of Hope
Mission.</TE>
<TE>   But when talking to Houston nonprofits about corporate giving, one
is more likely to hear about the largess of Dynegy Inc., Vinson &amp;
Elkins and Exxon Mobil Corp. And their executives play the part of
civic leaders, jumping into the gap left by Texas' laissez
faire-style of government and carving their names on the city's arts
centers. Jesse Jones, a financier and newspaper publisher, built
Jones Hall, home to the city's symphony. Gus Wortham, a cattle baron
and insurance magnate, lent his name to Wortham Center, built
entirely with private funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people know Houston from years gone by," said the city's
mayor, Lee P. Brown. "They don't know we have one of the best-looking
skylines in America. They don't know we're investing $2 billion in
our port, $2.8 billion in our airport. They don't know we have the
second-largest port in the country. They wouldn't know we've doubled
our population in the last decade, that our economy is one of the
most diverse in America."</TE>

<HD>Shuttered Toy Company Files for Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Courts: Laguna Hills firm that made Disney products was
shut last fall for labor violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owner-operators of a Laguna Hills toy company, shut down last
fall after the state accused it of violating labor laws in making
pink tiaras and wands for the Disney Store chain, have filed a
bankruptcy petition to liquidate their assets.</LD>
<LD>   Carol A. and David M. Schelin, who operated KTBA Inc., listed $2.5
million in debts and $586,646 in assets in a petition filed last week
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   For David Schelin, who served a prison term for embezzling
$1.1million from nearly 300 fellow Mormon Church members a decade
ago, the petition marks his second appearance in Bankruptcy Court. He
filed to liquidate his personal assets in October 1992, when he
pleaded guilty to grand theft charges.</LD>
<TE>   The latest filing stems from the closing of KTBA, which had made
an assortment of toys and gifts for such Walt Disney Co. units as the
retail stores and theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Disney, which accounted for most of the company's revenue, pulled
the plug on KTBA after state labor officials accused the company of
violating minimum-wage, overtime, industrial home-work and
child-labor laws in making items for the Disney shops.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, in small, closely held companies, the owners personally
guarantee loans and other credit, and the weight of those guarantees
after the business closed proved to be too much of a burden, said the
couple's bankruptcy attorney, J. Scott Williams of Irvine. "The
business just came to a screeching halt," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the state Division of Labor Standards Enforcement found
that KTBA employees assembled goods at home without proper permits,
typically worked 48 hours a week and earned 60 cents apiece for
tiaras and 40 cents for wands. The time it took to assemble the
products amounted to earnings of $1.35 an hour, far below the
$6.25-an-hour minimum wage at the time, the state said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney was selling the tiaras for $9.95 to $15.95 and the wands
for $2.65.</TE>
<TE>   Though not accused of any wrongdoing, Disney agreed to put
$902,778 into a special account run by the agency to pay workers and
to destroy the tiaras and wands, which had been removed from store
shelves. The state sued to collect the remaining $600,000 from KTBA
and Carol Schelin, the owner. Her husband was an employee, Williams
said.</TE>

<HD>XM Satellite Radio Shares Fall on Negative Note From
Auditor</HD>
<DH>Tech: Some analysts say investors overreacted to KPMG' s
letter filed with the SEC. Company says no cutbacks are planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the third consecutive year, the auditor for XM Satellite Radio
Holdings Inc. warned that the company would need to raise more funds
if it is to remain in business.</LD>
<LD>   The "going concern" letter from KPMG was part of XM's annual
report filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
company downplayed the significance of the letter, but XM shares fell
13%, or $2, to $13 in Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of XM, which in October began providing 100
channels of radio programming direct via satellite to subscribers,
said KPMG's annual audit letter included similar language last year
and in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Two analysts agreed that investors overreacted to the news. Oren
Cohen of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. blamed the nervous atmosphere generated
by the recent downfalls of formerly highflying companies such as
Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a misplaced reaction," Cohen said. "Given the speculative
nature of an enterprise like XM, the auditor was just stating the
obvious. People are not differentiating between stories out there."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst William Kidd of Lehman Bros. said individual stockholders
may have overreacted to the 10-K filing.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a company with a large number of retail investors,
there is the possibility they can get caught by surprise," Kidd said.</TE>
<TE>   XM raised $1.6 billion to get off the ground with the launch of
two satellites and to equip a facility that includes more than 80
production studios. But the company is not yet profitable, having
lost $307.5 million, or $5.13 a share, on sales of $533,000 last
year.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG said there is "substantial doubt" about XM's ability to
continue as a going concern unless the Washington company could raise
more money through a debt or stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   XM Treasurer Greg Cole said the company needs to raise an
additional $40 million to $65 million for operations this year. Cohen
said XM has a good record when it comes to finding investors.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, they have always succeeded in raising capital when they
needed it, even in tough times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of last year, XM announced it had 28,000 subscribers
nationwide, most of whom listen to the service in cars or trucks. The
cost to subscribers is $9.99 a month, in addition to a receiver that
goes for a minimum of about $200.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokesman said XM expects to have 70,000 subscribers by
the end of this month, when it reports first-quarter results, and
350,000 subscribers by the end of the year. XM is not planning
cutbacks or layoffs, he said.</TE>

<HD>Oversight Board Calls For Audit Watchdog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In one of its final acts before disbanding, an accounting oversight
board Tuesday called on Congress to create an independently funded
watchdog agency that would have the power to set accounting standards
and punish auditors for wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal by the Public Oversight Board--a private-sector panel
created in 1977 to help oversee the accounting industry--presents a
challenge to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt's own reform package, which seeks an oversight board with fewer
responsibilities and greater industry involvement.</LD>
<LD>   In January, angry board members voted to disband by the end of
March after Pitt unveiled his set of accounting reforms, which came
in response to the collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. Board members
said Pitt undercut their authority and rendered the board irrelevant
by failing to consult with members about his proposal.</LD>
<TE>   Under the board's rival proposal, a newly created Independent
Institute of Accountancy would consolidate all rule-making and
enforcement powers into a single agency, operating under SEC
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Charles A. Bowsher, chairman of the Public Oversight Board, told
Senate Banking Committee members Tuesday that such an entity would be
more independent and effective than the oversight board proposed by
Pitt, which he said would be dominated by major accounting firms and
focused chiefly on disciplinary actions and enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The board hopes to see its plan introduced as a Senate bill in
coming weeks, but Bowsher would not comment on possible sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come to the conclusion that the voluntary self-regulatory
program needs to be replaced because it has failed to keep pace with
challenges faced by the profession," Bowsher told lawmakers. "More
troubling is the resistance of the profession's trade association,
the AICPA [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants], and
several of the Big Five firms to major reform."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the trade group said Tuesday that it was reviewing
the board's plan and had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   The organization recently launched an advertising and lobbying
campaign to combat calls for sweeping new rules on accounting firms.
The accounting industry has been rocked in recent months by the
failure of Enron and Global Crossing Ltd., both of which collapsed
amid accusations of accounting manipulations.</TE>
<TE>   An SEC spokeswoman cautioned that Pitt has not completed his
reform package. "We're still listening to ideas," SEC spokeswoman
Christi Harlan said. "We don't have a formal proposal yet."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's next opportunity to lay out the details for his reform plan
could come as soon as Thursday, when he is scheduled to appear before
the same Senate committee.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan stressed that Pitt did not intend to offend the board when
he announced an outline of his reform ideas on Jan. 17. "We were
announcing the beginning of process," Harlan said. "It was not a
matter of cutting them out."</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher said a key distinction between his plan and Pitt's is that
the new oversight board would be independent of the Big Five
accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   The Independent Institute of Accountancy would be led by a
seven-member board appointed by various government agencies,
including the SEC and Federal Reserve Board. Big Five accounting
firms and the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants
would have no representatives on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Under Pitt's preliminary plan, the oversight board would include
several accounting industry representatives, though a majority of
members would be independent.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Pitt's plan, the Independent Institute of Accountancy also
would be charged with setting accounting standards by bringing the
Financial Accounting Standards Board under its control.</TE>
<TE>   "It achieves the streamlining of what commentators like to call
the alphabet soup of governance," said Aulana L. Peters, a member of
the Public Oversight Board.</TE>
<TE>   Both Pitt's plan and the one proposed by the board would give a
new oversight board the power to subpoena documents from accounting
firms and both call for replacement of the peer-review system, in
which accounting firms check the work of their rivals every three
years. Under that system, no Big Five firm has ever been cited for
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, both Pitt and the board want a new oversight board to
supervise such reviews. The plan Bowsher outlined would mandate
annual reviews of large accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher said the board probably would have an annual budget of
about $100 million, which he said would be raised by levying fees on
accounting corporations based upon their size. He said such fees
would be a tiny fraction of their total revenues.</TE>
<TE>   "If it buys them credibility [for their financial statements], it
would be very cheap," Bowsher said.</TE>
<TE>   The board proposes exempting small businesses if the rules prove
too costly or burdensome.</TE>
<TE>   Independent funding is key for the oversight board, Bowsher said.
He noted that in May 2000 major accounting firms, which had been
funding the board, refused to pay for special accounting reviews that
had been sought by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) said the current funding system
required the board to "go around with a tin cup in hand" asking for
money from the entities it is charged with overseeing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that voluntary [programs] don't work," Sarbanes said.</TE>

<HD>Asbestos Touted for Paper Use, '60s Memo Says</HD>
<DH>Health: Union Carbide pitch is cited by lawyer suing
Kleenex maker, which denies use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A document recently discovered through litigation describes efforts
by Union Carbide to promote the use of asbestos in facial tissues, a
development that prompted Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark Corp. to issue
a denial Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The memo, believed to be from the late 1960s, indicates that Union
Carbide sold asbestos to at least one paper manufacturer for use in
facial tissues.</LD>
<LD>   Union Carbide's Asbestos Information Bulletin promotes the use of
asbestos as a softening agent in facial tissues and towels and
mentions "Clark softness values," an apparent reference to
Kimberly-Clark.</LD>
<TE>   "This trial indicated that this paper company can save $174,000
per year in their facial operation alone," the memo says. "Result of
this work with this paper company: The company now uses asbestos in
all products--tissue, towels and facial tissue."</TE>
<TE>   "At no time did Kimberly-Clark commission the use of asbestos as
an ingredient in the manufacture of any Kimberly-Clark tissue
product," the company said in a statement issued Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Paper companies are among the latest targets of asbestos lawsuits.
Kimberly-Clark is named in 142, according to the annual report it
filed this week.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos--once used in insulation, floor tile, hair dryers,
automotive brakes and thousands of other products--is associated with
several diseases, including a rare cancer that appears decades after
exposure. The discovery that there were asbestos-laden facial tissues
on the market would be an alarming development, given the possibility
of consumers breathing in asbestos fibers.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing victims of asbestos-related diseases
discovered the memo several months ago in a Union Carbide document
repository. They are investigating and have pressed Kimberly-Clark
and other tissue makers to disclose whether they used asbestos in
consumer products.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Union Carbide, which was acquired last year by
Dow Chemical Co., could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly-Clark said it reviewed historical documents and
interviewed current and retired plant workers, scientists, engineers
and executives. That investigation showed that the company "never
permitted asbestos to be used as an ingredient in any tissue product
it sold," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Dave Dickson also noted that tests on 16 boxes of
tissues provided by lawyer Mark Lanier found no trace of asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears the plaintiff is casting a wide net over a number of
companies," Kimberly-Clark said. "The plaintiff's claim seems to be
based upon marketing materials which are nearly 40 years old."</TE>
<TE>   But Lanier, a Houston lawyer representing more than 100 plaintiffs
in three lawsuits against Kimberly-Clark, said he suspects that the
company put asbestos in facial tissues because of the Union Carbide
memo's use of the phrase "Clark softness values."</TE>
<TE>   "I also have information that Kimberly-Clark was buying asbestos
from the late '60s through 1976," Lanier said. "So they are buying
asbestos. What are they doing with it? I do believe they were putting
it in some kind of paper product."</TE>
<TE>   Lanier said the tissues that were tested were from the 1930s and
1940s, earlier than the period under suspicion. Since then, he said,
he has obtained 20 more boxes through the Internet auction site EBay.
Those boxes, which are from a "variety of periods," have yet to be
tested, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have lock-down proof yet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery within the last six months of other documents
showing Union Carbide sold asbestos to paper companies has brought
more than a dozen manufacturers and mills into the sights of
plaintiffs' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia-Pacific Corp., Scott Paper Co. and Weyerhaeuser Co. are
among thousands of companies that have been sued for exposing people
to asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-four companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection as a result of asbestos lawsuits, and the litigation is
expected to eventually cost companies $275 billion.</TE>
<TE>   More than 500,000 people have filed lawsuits against thousands of
companies alleging they were injured by exposure to asbestos, and
some experts believe as many as 2 million more claims will be filed.</TE>

<KH>THE HP-COMPAQ VOTE</KH>
<HD>Declaration of Victory Seen as Vintage Fiorina</HD>
<DH>CEO again relies on her mantra of exuding confidence and
praying she's right as she rallies her troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CUPERTINO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It was classic Carly.</LD>
<LD>   Early Tuesday morning, standing before an auditorium packed with
snarling shareholders, Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carleton
S. "Carly" Fiorina declared victory in Silicon Valley's most bitterly
waged corporate war.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't matter that she might be wrong. The marketing guru, who
has emerged as one of corporate America's most controversial
executives, focused on the mantra that has been her touchstone
throughout her nearly three-year reign: Exude confidence and pray
you're right.</LD>
<TE>   The gamble was quintessential Fiorina. She has staked her career
on the fate of HP's proposed $20-billion takeover of Compaq Computer
Corp. With the ballots cast and waiting to be counted, she has
nothing left to lose. If she wins, she is a soothsayer with a
promising future. If she's wrong, critics expect her to be ushered
out the door.</TE>
<TE>   The high-tech world is littered with executives who couldn't
manage the next technology transition. Eckhard Pfeiffer of Compaq,
Apple Computer Inc.'s Gilbert Amelio and Ellen Hancock of Exodus
Communications Inc., among many others, were never able to recover
from their inability to judge new directions as industry conditions
shifted radically underfoot.</TE>
<TE>   Even Fiorina's closest friends acknowledge that she could easily
join this executive graveyard if she loses the proxy fight for
Compaq. But on this crucial day, Fiorina concentrated on sending out
an optimistic message. She shocked the crowd of shareholders,
surprised Wall Street and infuriated one of her own directors, Walter
Hewlett, son of co-founder William Hewlett.</TE>
<TE>   By declaring victory at the Flint Center in Cupertino, Fiorina
gave herself a pseudo- mandate to move forward with the merger--at
least for the next three weeks until the tally has been certified.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the strategy allows her to prepare the
finishing touches on a massive effort to integrate the day-to-day
functions of two computer behemoths, which includes finding 15,000
jobs to cut. She also must blend the corporate cultures of HP's past
and Compaq's present into a seamless future.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts, who insist that the proxy vote is too close
to predict, see Fiorina's declaration primarily as a rallying cry for
her troops--as well as for herself.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like such a political election scenario that maybe by
claiming victory she'll make it come true," said Daniel Kunstler,
senior analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are probably better that they did win, but the fact is
it's still too close to call."</TE>
<TE>   If Fiorina is wrong--and a good chunk of HP shareholders hope she
is--that would provide the ammunition to critics who have been
calling for her removal. A scathing open letter published in January
in the trade magazine Red Herring began with a simple request: "Dear
Ms. Fiorina, Please resign."</TE>
<TE>   "I was disgusted with her appointment from the minute she came
in," said Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist, a
financial newsletter. "If I was a betting man, I'd bet that the
Hewlett-Packard employees will vote en masse against Carly."</TE>
<TE>   Heralded as Hero, Lambasted as Heathen</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina, who received degrees from Stanford University, the
University of Maryland and MIT, gained a reputation while at Lucent
Technologies Inc. as a fearless, high-energy corporate leader.</TE>
<TE>   Her plan for HP was equally aggressive. She endeavored to
transform all aspects of the firm at once, despite the economic
slump. As she promised to remake HP's plodding culture and restore
growth, it seemed the company had finally found someone who could
fill the shoes of its legendary founders: Hewlett and David Packard.</TE>
<TE>   But as quickly as she was heralded as a hero, Fiorina was
lambasted as a heathen, someone who pushed too hard and too fast for
the slow-moving HP. It was a classic peril for an executive who tries
to play the role of savior and fails to reap success fast enough to
please her corporate constituents.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes for Fiorina are huge. Her attempt to buy consulting
firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for $18billion in late 2000 was abandoned
after two months under intense pressure from shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Should the blockbuster Compaq deal fall through as well, few
believe she will stay with the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "A few months ago I would have said this vote's a referendum on
Carly Fiorina," Kunstler said. "To her credit, she's managed to turn
it back to a referendum on the merger."</TE>
<TE>   Appearing tired but poised Tuesday at the Flint Center, Fiorina
read brief remarks. Then, in a vintage move, she waited for the
onslaught of hostile questions to begin and calmly responded, always
underscoring her pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Politics aside, analysts say it was incumbent upon Fiorina to say
something definitive about the merger.</TE>
<TE>   It could be days, or even weeks, before the election results are
official. In the meantime, neither HP nor Compaq can afford to exist
in a state of suspended animation.</TE>
<TE>   "If she went up there and said, 'We're not going to know anything
for three weeks,' that would be bad for [employee] morale," said Tom
Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a research affiliate of New
York brokerage Wall Street Access. "She has to do something like
this."</TE>
<TE>   Many Industry Analysts Believe HP Will Prevail</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone bought into Fiorina's vision. Some small
investors said they had voted against the acquisition because they
were put off by Fiorina's approach, such as her personal attacks on
Walter Hewlett.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett was met with a standing ovation at the shareholders
meeting and was interrupted by applause during his brief remarks.
Fiorina, on the other hand, received boos and hisses when she said
that a majority of HP employees supported the acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett acknowledged that Fiorina must have convinced
Hewlett-Packard's lawyers that she had enough votes in hand from
large institutional investors to make a public statement of victory.</TE>
<TE>   Although there have been close proxy fights in the past, there has
never been a battle this big that has remained this close this late
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Many industry analysts believe HP will prevail, but they are
convinced more by the events of recent weeks than by Fiorina's public
spin Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "With this slim a margin, we have to fess up to the fact that this
is a guessing game," Kunstler said. "It's simply too close to call."</TE>

<HD>Trade Deficit Grows in January</HD>
<DH>Economy: The gap between exports and imports plus a strong
dollar have further increased the U.S.' dependence on foreign money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The global recession and the strong dollar are causing the trade
deficit to widen again, setting the U.S. economy on a course that may
prove difficult to maintain.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the trade gap
expanded to $28.5 billion in January from $24.7 billion in December.
Last week the government said a broader measure of the trade
shortfall rose slightly in the fourth quarter of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The growing gap between exports and imports points to what some
analysts consider the Achilles' heel of the U.S. economy: its
increasing dependence on foreign capital. Every dollar of trade
deficit moves another dollar into foreign hands, and analysts warn
that there is a limit to how many dollars foreigners are willing to
hold.</LD>
<TE>   "Basically, the United States is asking global investors to
perpetually increase the share of U.S.-denominated securities in
their portfolios," said Goldman Sachs senior economist Jan Hatzius.
"That at some point just will not be sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   The reason has to do with the unconventional behavior of the world
economy and the American dollar.</TE>
<TE>   The recession that appears to be ending in the United States was
only part of an unusual, worldwide downturn. In a typical domestic
recession, the trade deficit shrinks because exports hold their own
even as American consumers buy fewer foreign goods.</TE>
<TE>   Because this recession is global, however, U.S. exports have been
hurt by weak foreign demand. That kept the trade deficit from
narrowing much during the recession, and it is causing it to expand
quickly as the economy speeds up.</TE>
<TE>   Another anomaly is at work in this cycle. The dollar has continued
to rise in value, despite downward pressure exerted by low U.S.
interest rates. Normally, the dollar weakens as foreign investors
seek higher returns elsewhere. Exports surge because dollars are
cheap in foreign countries, and the trade balance improves. But for
now the U.S. dollar is maintaining its high value--and U.S. products,
their high price.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual pairing of a muscular dollar and a puny world economy
has pummeled U.S. manufacturers, which are bearing the brunt of an
otherwise short and shallow recession.</TE>
<TE>   No Mild Downturn for U.S. Manufacturers</TE>
<TE>   "For manufacturing, this was anything but a mild downturn," said
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com in West Chester, Pa. "It
was a full-blown, outright recession, even more severe than 1990-91."</TE>
<TE>   Some economists say the worsening trade balance will inevitably
cause the dollar to depreciate, as foreigners become increasingly
wary of the U.S. investment outlook and move their money elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   It's an adjustment many consider overdue. But a sudden and sharp
descent could be painful. Prices of imported goods would jump,
reducing living standards and possibly rekindling inflation. Stock
and bond prices could plummet, and interest rates would probably
rise. If the jolt was severe enough, it could even trigger a
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners already hold 36% of all U.S. Treasury securities, 21%
of all corporate bonds issued by U.S. companies and 11% of their
publicly traded stock, according to Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   America's net foreign debt was $2.2 trillion at the end of 2000,
equal to roughly 22% of the nation's gross domestic product. If
current trends continue, the firm expects foreign debt will reach
$5.8trillion, or 50% of GDP, by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a real risk that at some point, foreign exchange traders
will find that the dollar isn't particularly attractive," Hatzius
said. "I don't think it's going to lead to mayhem in the U.S. economy
overall, but it could be quite a big event in the FX [foreign
exchange] market."</TE>
<TE>   Although many economists expect the growing trade gap to force the
dollar to lose value some day, they say the transition should be
manageable as long as it proceeds in an orderly fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly seems that investors around the globe are more than
willing to hold the bucks that they're accumulating because of this
current account deficit," said Stephen Slifer, chief U.S. economist
at Lehman Bros. "They had ample opportunity to pull the plug already,
and they didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The current account includes investment flows as well as trade in
goods and services, which is measured by the more familiar trade
balance.</TE>
<TE>   Good Can Come</TE>
<TE>   From Large Deficit</TE>
<TE>   A large deficit is not inherently bad. It means the United States
is borrowing from foreigners to finance a portion of its domestic
spending and investment. If the foreign money is used productively,
as it was in the 19th century to build railroads, America comes out
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   A strong dollar can be a good thing, too. In recent years, it
helped keep inflation at bay by reducing the price of imports, and
attracted the foreign funds needed to finance the investment boom of
the late 1990s. The result: low interest rates, high employment and,
until last year, robust economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The flip side of the very large deficit is the strong capital
inflows into this country," said Jay Bryson, global economist with
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. "One of the reasons foreigners
are willing to invest in the U.S. is their belief that the dollar
will continue to get stronger."</TE>
<TE>   But there are inevitable trade-offs. If the trade deficit gets out
of hand, future living standards will be reduced as the nation
devotes an increasing share of its economic output to foreign debt
service.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the strong dollar will continue to clobber
manufacturers, causing more business failures and work-force
reductions. More than 1.7 million factory jobs have disappeared since
mid-2000.</TE>
<TE>   David Barge, president of family-owned Barge Forest Products Co.
in Macon, Miss., is troubled by what he sees.</TE>
<TE>   In a good year, about a third of the firm's $11 million in revenue
comes from sales of high-grade yellow pine to foreign furniture
makers. Exports accounted for only about one-quarter of last year's
revenue, as the rising dollar increased the cost of Barge's products
in overseas markets.</TE>
<TE>   Barge tried to hold on to the business by cutting prices, but some
buyers had already left the fold.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of it is psychological," said Barge. "When our customers
see the dollar at a certain level, they say they're not going to buy
any USA wood because the exchange rate is just too high. You can't
talk to them."</TE>
<TE>   Zandi, the Economy.com analyst, estimates that one in five factory
jobs lost since mid-2000 was a casualty of the strong dollar. Even if
the U.S. economy quickly recovers, the attrition among manufacturers
whose products compete with foreign-made goods will continue as long
as the dollar remains strong.</TE>

<HD>Merger Could Chain HP to the Past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Hewlett-Packard Co.'s epic battle to acquire Compaq Computer
Corp., winning could mean losing.</LD>
<LD>   HP plus Compaq would create the world's biggest personal computer
maker, adding inherent efficiencies of scale as well as critical mass
to become a leader in technology services.</LD>
<LD>   But even the largest technology merger in history may offer little
cover from the inexorable cycle of change that is pushing the PC to
the sidelines, technology historians say.</LD>
<TE>   If the merger proceeds, as HP declared it will Tuesday, it may
relegate the storied company's greatest glories to the past. As the
largest PC company, it would tie itself firmly to a fading market,
analysts say. They discount HP's arguments that the combined
companies could become the industry leader in server computers that
manage networks and in lucrative technology services.</TE>
<TE>   "The game has changed fundamentally for all the players in the PC
business," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business
School. PCs have become generic and interchangeable. Profits lie in
efficiency--and by slashing prices in a furious race to the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   HP, whose founders created the original Silicon Valley start-up in
a Palo Alto garage in 1939, has thrived in a fast-changing industry
for decades. Yet victory in the hard-fought merger battle could turn
the technology giant into a victim of the latest wave of "creative
destruction" that has shaped and reshaped commercial technology
development for decades.</TE>
<TE>   That term, coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter in the early
1900s, describes the inevitable changes forged by new technologies as
they replace mature products as drivers of innovation and profits.</TE>
<TE>   Like cars, steel, TVs, calculators and household appliances, HP's
most important products--PCs, printers and relatively inexpensive
server computers that operate networks--are reaching the "oligarchic"
stage of development, said Raymond Miles, former dean of the Haas
School of Business at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to downward pricing pressure that has squeezed
out many PC makers, leaving a handful of behemoths selling look-alike
products. The recent recession shrank shipments of PCs last year, the
first such decline since the mid-1980s, leading to massive
overcapacity in manufacturing. According to market analysis firm
International Data Corp., PC revenues will shrink 8% in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors suggest to experts that HP's future, with or without
Compaq, must radically change direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Within a mature industry, there's room for the most innovative
firm, the most cost-efficient firm, the most adaptive firm," Miles
said. But even those leaders may enjoy few big commercial
breakthroughs.</TE>
<TE>   The only sure winners may be Dell Computer Corp., the master of
efficiency, and IBM Corp., the best at making PCs a loss leader to
"up-sell" services and expensive hardware to large companies.</TE>
<TE>   Navigating Major Technology Transitions</TE>
<TE>   The decline of the PC industry follows a long-standing pattern.
Each new generation of technology destroys complacent firms and
replaces them with dynamic upstarts or deft innovators--much as a
forest fire clears the way for new growth.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s and 1950s, defense electronics needs dominated high
tech as the nation pressed to win World War II, the Korean War and
the space race. HP got its start with a low-cost audio oscillator
that quickly positioned it for the needs of the era.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s and 1970s, integrated circuits took over the focus of
commercial development. Memory chips, a low-cost but essential
component of computers, and microprocessors, the central brain of
computers, vaulted Intel Corp. to the stature of an industrial giant.</TE>
<TE>   From the 1970s through the 1980s, consumer electronics, from
calculators to videocassette recorders, brought microcircuits to the
mass market. Silicon chips also led to low-cost PCs--launching
Compaq, Dell and Microsoft Corp. as central players in a period of
hyper-growth that lasted through the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, networked computing and the Internet succeeded
the PC as the focus of innovation and commercial success--leading to
the Internet boom of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   HP navigated these major transitions better than many others. But
in the process it became increasingly PC-centric, and it now faces a
critical choice: to ride the next wave of change or to be swept away
as the industry remakes itself.</TE>
<TE>   HP hopes that Compaq would add variety and strength to its product
line. For example, Compaq's popular iPaq hand-held computer, equipped
with wireless connections to the Internet, has emerged as the
strongest competitor to the Palm hand-held device.</TE>
<TE>   Great companies outdistance rivals by making big bets on the
future--positioning massive resources around the next big trends. And
analysts seem to agree on a few key growth areas:</TE>
<TE>   * Mobile communications and computing already are building a huge
market--populated by products such as iPaq and the increasingly
popular wireless e-mail pagers. Hundreds of start-ups are vying to
find the winning formula.</TE>
<TE>   * In the post-Sept. 11 environment, high-tech security has soared.
Data-mining software to track terrorists, bomb-sniffing machines and
screening devices and identification cards that use fingerprints,
face recognition or even snippets of DNA to verify identity are
garnering huge investments.</TE>
<TE>   * The convergence of biotechnology and high tech--already a
multibillion-dollar industry--could become a major commercial force
within a few years. It's no accident that IBM is building "Blue
Gene," a supercomputer 15 times faster than today's most powerful
models, to research the human genome.</TE>
<TE>   * The commercial development of nanotechnology--the science of
creating microscopic machines and materials atom by atom--may lead to
computer chips that are vastly more powerful yet thousands of times
smaller and less expensive than today's models. Some scientists see
the nanotech transition beginning within a decade.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows what companies or approaches will prevail in those
technology trends or others that may prove even more important. But
in nearly all past transitions, companies willing to embrace drastic
change, despite the cost, often have prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Intel saw more efficient Japanese manufacturers
quickly capturing its market for memory chips--the source of most of
Intel's revenue. The company jettisoned the memory market and threw
its engineers into an emerging product, microprocessors. The move
created the world's dominant chip maker.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft finessed the decline of the PC market, its principal
franchise, by reorienting its entire product line around the
Internet. Like Intel, the software giant transformed itself
internally, rather than merging with other companies to change
course.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1995 Microsoft was nowhere in network-based computing. Yet it
made an extraordinary transition to the Internet and today is making
a strong move in network-based services," said Harvard's Yoffie.</TE>
<TE>   Looking Ahead,</TE>
<TE>   Not Back, to Succeed</TE>
<TE>   Less than a decade ago, Sun Microsystems Inc. was merely a builder
of powerful workstation computers for engineers. As far cheaper PCs
began to narrow the performance gap with Sun's products, the company
created Java--now an essential software programming language for
online commerce. As a result, hundreds of corporations have
gravitated to Sun's hardware, said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   With or without Compaq, HP has qualities and resources that could
lead to similarly bold moves. The company spends lavishly on research
and development. Its engineering culture encourages innovation.</TE>
<TE>   HP has pushed rapidly to build mobility features into its core
products. The company conducts groundbreaking research on
nanotechnology and molecular-scale microprocessors.</TE>
<TE>   And HP is not always risk-averse. In the 1990s, as less costly,
standardized microprocessors became a market imperative, the company
gave up much of its proprietary chip development and joined forces
with Intel to work on the next generation of processors.</TE>
<TE>   But with or without Compaq, HP may be forced to place bigger bets
if it is to remain a key technology player. Gamblers don't always
win, but looking to the past as a survival strategy--as some view the
HP-Compaq merger--usually means failure, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "All companies are faced with the same dilemma," said Doug Henton,
president of Collaborative Economics, which studies the Silicon
Valley economy. "How do you consistently innovate?"</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Unworried by Signs of Rising Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve signaled Tuesday that it stands poised to raise
interest rates later this year. But so far, the stock market isn't
acting terribly threatened by that possibility.</LD>
<LD>   That's because many investors are betting that the same force that
would drive rates higher--a recovering economy--also would power a
sharp rebound in corporate earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Recent history shows that, while rising interest rates can present
a hurdle for the market as corporate borrowing becomes more costly,
stock prices can advance in periods when the Fed is tightening
credit--as long as profits are growing and inflation stays tame.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1985 there have been eight periods when the Fed was raising
its benchmark short-term rate, the federal funds rate. Each time, the
blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index was higher one year after
the first Fed rate increase.</TE>
<TE>   The average price gain after one year: 15.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Major stock indexes closed modestly higher Tuesday after the Fed
kept its key short-term rate unchanged at 1.75%, but also shifted its
"bias" on rates to neutral, which is the first step to eventually
raising credit costs.</TE>
<TE>   "For the market, the important question is whether profits
rebound, and how strongly," said Russ Koesterich, investment
strategist at New York brokerage Instinet Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Investors anticipated that the Fed would change its bias Tuesday,
given stronger-than-expected economic data in recent weeks. Those
same data are encouraging investors to expect corporate profits to
resurge, after a decline last year that was the worst in a generation
despite what now appears to have been a mild recession.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Hill, research director at earnings-tracker Thomson
Financial/First Call in Boston, said analysts expect S&amp;P 500
companies' operating earnings in the second quarter to post their
first year-over-year gain since the fourth quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts surveyed by First Call expect first-quarter S&amp;P earnings
to fall 8.6% from a year earlier, before adjustments for a change in
accounting standards that eliminates the need for many companies to
write off "goodwill." That would be a major improvement on the fourth
quarter's 21.7% drop.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also expect second-quarter S&amp;P earnings to be up 9%,
followed by a 30.9% jump in third-quarter results and a 41.7% surge
in fourth-quarter results.</TE>
<TE>   The big question is whether those numbers are reasonable, or far
too optimistic--and how much of an earnings turnaround already is
built into stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The news on both the economy and earnings should be good for a
while," Hill said. But he said third- and fourth-quarter estimates
may be too glowing.</TE>
<TE>   Hill cautioned that second-half estimates for the hard-hit
technology sector of the S&amp;P, in particular, might be too rosy. After
a 25% drop for tech earnings in the first quarter, analysts expect a
38% rise in the second quarter, then a 132% jump in the third and a
72% surge in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "That 132% number sticks in my craw," Hill said. "That's a big
swing."</TE>
<TE>   Even outside the tech area, Hill said, lingering "Enronitis" could
keep 2002 profit gains limited.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are going to push the envelope less and auditors are
going to be more vigilant," he said. "When you put it all together
you have to be a little skeptical about these earnings projections
coming out of a recession."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Siegel, finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania
and author of "Stocks for the Long Run," said stocks ran up in the
fourth quarter in anticipation of an earnings turnaround this year.</TE>
<TE>   "That profit recovery is built into stock prices, so the threat to
the market is that it fails to materialize," Siegel said.</TE>
<TE>   By tempering the economy, higher interest rates may set the stage
for "moderate but unspectacular" stock gains this year, he said:
"We'll probably see ragged, upward movement, but not a strong bull
market taking hold."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many analysts say that even if the Fed begins to raise
rates, the increases should be moderate. The federal funds rate may
rise just to 2.25% by summer, Koesterich said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed would just be bringing rates back to normal, up from the
"panic" levels set after Sept. 11, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   If short-term rates were jacked up a full percentage point by
later in the year, they would still be low by historical standards,
experts note.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Fed's overall impact is muted, a climate of rising
rates can weigh on certain stock sectors, such as autos, analysts
say. But some say "cyclical" industries such as chemicals and
semiconductors are now in the market's sweet spot because their
fortunes are leveraged to an economy on the brink of bouncing back.</TE>
<TE>   In the financial sector, Koesterich said brokerage stocks could
benefit from a pickup in mergers and acquisitions, along with initial
public offerings of stock.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stocks have outperformed larger stocks for the last two
years, but Koesterich said blue chips could hold their own in a
rising rate environment--assuming that a stronger dollar attracts
more foreign investors, who often seek out big-name stocks first.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar has rallied back in recent days against the yen, after
sliding early in March. The dollar has weakened only modestly against
the euro currency in recent weeks.</TE>

<LD>As a former butler, a TV news producer and an aspiring filmmaker,
Mytchell Mora kept bumping into Hollywood folk who told of their
romps through Cuba. All these stories left the young man with a fever
for the forbidden island, and nothing could stop him from going.</LD>
<LD>   Mora's first visit was in 1999, and it was like being blown a kiss
by a lovely senorita. Balmy breezes, white-sand beaches, strong
cigars. Cuba, sad and beautiful, romanced him and called him back
again later that year. He shot a video about how simple it is to
travel there, but it didn't exactly land him in the Hollywood Hills.
He unloaded about 1,000 copies on his Web site, including a bunch he
gave away.</LD>
<LD>   Now Mora is 31, living in a studio apartment a block off Hollywood
Boulevard with a girlfriend and a Great Dane, and the United States
government is after him as if he were an enemy of the state.</LD>
<TE>   He's not the only snake in our midst. Other targets of the
crackdown include a teacher who biked across Cuba, two Iowa grandmas
who were on a diving trip and a man who visited Cuba to scatter his
missionary father's ashes next to a church he had built.</TE>
<TE>   Rest easy, America. Washington's got our backs covered.</TE>
<TE>   Mora was informed in 2000 and again last year by the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that he had
violated the Trading with the Enemy Act. He was ordered to document
every step he took and every cent he spent while in Cuba, or else.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me it was an extremely serious matter, with a maximum
fine of $250,000 and possible jail time of six months," Mora says,
although fines have averaged closer to $7,500 for other violators. In
the first warning sent to Mora, OFAC said its gumshoes had spotted
the Cuba video on his Web site. Your tax dollars at work.</TE>
<TE>   Mora and others complained to congressional representatives about
all this goose-stepping by an obscure federal agency with too much
time on its hands. Tomorrow in Washington, D.C., a bipartisan group
of these lawmakers will call for an end to a 40-year policy that
makes less sense each day Fidel Castro draws breath.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think every American has a Constitutional right to travel
unless there's a compelling security reason not to," says U.S. Rep.
Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). "I'm no fan of Castro, and I think he's a thug
and a tyrant. But every American deserves an opportunity to see what
a mess he's made of that island."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 60,000 Americans traveled to Cuba last year in
violation of the travel ban, while more than 100,000 others managed
to get permission. Flake and several colleagues hope to lift the
travel ban, advance democracy on the island, permit agricultural
sales to Cuba and promote cooperation on drug interdiction.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people and more and more members of Congress want to
see changes, but at the White House, the president's gaze is on the
votes of right-wing Cuban exiles living in Florida," says Wayne
Smith, a former U.S. diplomat in Cuba who is now with the Center for
International Policy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's brother is up for reelection in Florida, and the
president, of course, wants to win Florida more decisively in 2004.
So he wants to do nothing that would offend these right-wing voters.
He's got these Neanderthals running our Latin policy, and they are
moving in the direction of tightening the controls and cracking down
rather than loosening up."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill made the critical mistake of
speaking honestly on this subject last week, and was immediately
slapped down by the White House. O'Neill was at a hearing in which
Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) said in so many words that
investigative resources would be better spent hunting Al Qaeda
terrorists than little old ladies from Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had the discretion for applying the resources, I would agree
with you completely," O'Neill told Dorgan. But before the day was
out, the White House had removed O'Neill's tonsils, releasing a
statement in his name that supported the travel ban.</TE>
<TE>   Smith predicts Congress will have the votes to lift the ban this
year, setting up a veto by Bush and a subsequent brawl that could go
either way.</TE>
<TE>   Mora, meanwhile, continues to defy OFAC requests for information
on his trips to Cuba, and if he's fined, he'll fight. The embargo has
done nothing but bring hunger and suffering to Cuba, he says. And
with Cuba proving to be a friend in the war on terrorism, there's an
opening for improved relations.</TE>
<TE>   If you can travel to North Korea and Vietnam, why not Cuba? Mora
asks. You can also vacation in China, where censorship, torture and
executions for mere property crimes did not stand in the way of
most-favored-nation status.</TE>
<TE>   "Our government has bent over backward to look the other way in
China," says Mora.</TE>
<TE>   He's thinking of returning to Cuba, by the way. He'd like to make
a documentary, this time, on an embargo that might have made sense
once, long, long ago.</TE>

<HD>Patient on Rampage at Hospital Is Shot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police shot and critically wounded a patient at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center early Tuesday after he attempted to stab
another patient with a broken piece of glass, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 39-year-old man, who was not immediately identified by
hospital or police officials, had been housed in the general medical
wing of the hospital when he flew into a rage, said hospital
spokeswoman Jane Hong.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they don't know what upset him or why he chose to
attack the other patient.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the man used a fire extinguisher to smash a window in
the other patient's room. He then picked up a large piece of glass
and approached the patient, who was lying in bed, said police Lt.
Horace Frank.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital security guards called police when they couldn't get the
suspect to calm down or leave the room, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived at the fourth-floor medical ward in the
hospital's South Tower, the suspect was standing over the other
patient's bed and looked to them like he was about to stab him, Frank
said.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect had essentially taken the other patient hostage, Frank
said.</TE>
<TE>   After trying unsuccessfully to convince the suspect to put down
the glass, officers fired several nonlethal beanbag rounds, Frank
said, but "the rounds had no apparent effect."</TE>
<TE>   "He became more erratic," Frank continued. "His behavior got worse
and he raised the glass over the patient."</TE>
<TE>   Officer Thomas Mace, who led a team of six officers, shot the
suspect an unspecified number of times in the chest, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital personnel performed surgery on the suspect, spokeswoman
Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   No one else was injured.</TE>
<TE>   "The officer really saved the other patient's life, no doubt about
it," said Frank, adding that police are likely to charge the suspect
with attempted murder.</TE>

<HD>Hells Angels Leader Takes Plea Bargain</HD>
<DH>Courts: As part of the deal, most counts against George
Christie Jr., his ex-wife and son are dropped in massive drug-sales
case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY, DAVID KELLY and TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. pleaded guilty
Tuesday to conspiring to sell drugs and no contest to filing a false
tax return, capping the longest and most expensive criminal case in
Ventura County history.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, 54, his ex-wife and 25-year-old son all entered pleas in
Superior Court in Ventura after cutting deals that end with the
dismissal of most of the counts against them.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise plea bargain apparently ends a five-year
investigation into allegations that the elder Christie ran a criminal
ring that stole drugs from an Air Force base and sold them to
teenagers as they left five school campuses in Ventura and Ojai.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors had charged that Christie, operating out of his Main
Street tattoo parlor and Angels clubhouse in Ventura, illegally sold
prescription drugs at or near the high schools through a group of
youths called "The Outfit."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Christie, 55, pleaded guilty to one count of accessory to
grand theft after the fact. George Christie III, also a Hells Angel,
pleaded no contest to two counts of possession of drugs for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's been great," said a smiling George Christie Jr.,
standing on Main Street in downtown Ventura with his fiancee after
the plea. "I'm going to go out to dinner and take advantage of my
freedom."</TE>
<TE>   He said he would not make any statements on the plea bargain until
after the April 17 sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said their position was undercut last month when a
Santa Barbara judge ruled that the Ventura County grand jury that
indicted 28 Hells Angels and associates in February 2001 was
defective because it was contained too few women.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa threw out the indictment of a
suspected murderer in another case, and opened the door for
challenges by lawyers for the Hells Angels and anyone else indicted
by the panel. Cheryl Christie quickly filed a challenge to the grand
jury's makeup, and several Hells Angels joined the motion.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Bennett acknowledged that the Santa
Barbara ruling played a role in the decision to drop dozens of other
felony charges against the Christies. But defense lawyers said
prosecutors may also have realized their case was shaky.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen defendants have now pleaded guilty or no contest to
reduced charges, and most have been released from custody. Many of
the most serious charges have been dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice has been served today, and we're all heading in the right
direction," Bennett said. "I think we've all served the community
well."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said the elder Christie faces a maximum of seven years in
prison for the two admitted felonies, but probably will not spend any
more time in jail. Christie was jailed a year ago, and spent 11
months behind bars before being released under house arrest last
month on a $2-million bond.</TE>
<TE>   Christie's son, who has been in Ventura County Jail for more than
a year, was expected to be set free late Tuesday. Cheryl Christie has
been free on $100,000 bail for several months, and the court lifted
strict bail conditions Tuesday that had kept her from visiting her
ailing mother in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Under Tuesday's plea agreement, the government will keep $147,552
seized in raids of defendants' homes and properties. It will return
to Christie $60,000 that was confiscated during the investigation and
the Hells Angels clubhouse in west Ventura that had been seized by
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Jim Farley, who represents one of the Hells Angels still
charged in the case, said prosecutors may have concluded that their
132-count indictment was overblown and that the case was not strong
enough to take before a jury.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something that was blown tremendously out of proportion,"
Farley said. "I was concerned it might have been a vendetta between
the D.A.'s office and Christie."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and defense attorneys said little late Tuesday after
agreeing not to discuss the plea agreements, which followed weeks of
secret negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the Christie family had faced 57 criminal counts--23
against George Christie Jr., 19 against his ex-wife and 13 against
their son. Their daughter, Moriya Christie, a Ventura lawyer, was
also charged with two counts of making a false statement on a
home-purchase document, but that case was dropped months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The massive Hells Angels case took eight months to present to the
grand jury and included tens of thousands of pages of evidence,
seized during raids over the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have said previously that 28 defendants were
charged with 132 criminal counts to force some to plead guilty and
testify against the elder Christie, who for decades has cultivated
the image of an upstanding member of the community.</TE>
<TE>   Christie, a co-founder of the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels
and a national club spokesman for two decades, has always maintained
his innocence in the broad drug-and-racketeering case. He was also
charged with evading taxes, grand theft, fraud and firearms
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Christie has said the Angels pose no threat to the community. He
describes his group as a recreational motorcycle club. Some members
may have broken the law, but the Angels have never been involved in
crime as an organization, he has said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the D.A. wants from me," Christie said before
his arrest last year. "Am I a threat to this community? No."</TE>
<TE>   In previous interviews, Christie said this case is just the latest
in a series of federal and state inquiries that targeted him because
of his prominence but that had led only to a misdemeanor
fighting-in-public conviction in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   He was harassed again, Christie has said, because he hosted the
Angels' 50th anniversary celebration in downtown Ventura in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He was most disturbed, he has said, by the charges that the Hells
Angels were involved in the sale of Vicodin and Valium to teenagers,
something he said he would never allow.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are trying to justify the time and money they've
wasted investigating him, he said last year, adding: "And it's a
shame they have to go after my family because they have a problem
with me."</TE>

<LD>In response to the controversy over secret votes and meetings, the
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday scheduled a public
discussion next month to air out and attempt to address mounting
complaints about public access.</LD>
<LD>   On the motion of Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, the board will hear
from critics on April2.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy arose earlier this month, when documents revealed
that the board took a secret vote to kill an initiative to raise the
wages of home health-care aides and the meetings and telephone calls
that followed. First Amendment advocates say the private meetings and
calls were illegal.</LD>

<LD>Newly performed DNA tests linked a prison inmate who died last month
to six East Bay killings that had been unsolved for more than 20
years--and have cleared a man long suspected in his wife's murder.</LD>
<LD>   The tests show that Charles "Junior" Jackson, 64, who died of a
heart attack while serving a life term for a 1982 rape-murder, killed
five other women and a man during burglaries from 1975 to 1981, said
Rockne Harmon, an Alameda County prosecutor.</LD>

<LD>U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton announced Tuesday that she will
start discussions with the Klamath Tribes on the possible restoration
of some of their lost reservation land and on what role they will
play in the ongoing conflict over water in the basin.</LD>
<LD>   The tribes have been arguing with farmers over irrigation
allotments to the region straddling the Oregon-California border out
of concern for two endangered species of suckerfish that for
generations had been a food source and ceremonial symbol.</LD>
<LD>   The tribes are seeking 690,000 acres in the Winema and Fremont
national forests in southern Oregon.</LD>

<HD>EPA Is Probing Dairies' Waste</HD>
<DH>Water: Chino-area farmers, a state inspector are subpoenaed
over the discharge of manure into the Santa Ana River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several dairy farmers in the Chino area have been served with federal
subpoenas in an apparent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
investigation into how manure was illegally discharged into the Santa
Ana River, industry officials confirmed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The subpoenas, written by the U.S. attorney's office on behalf of
the EPA, seek records detailing the farmers' waste-discharge
practices over the past decade, said leaders of the California Milk
Producers Council and the Western United Dairymen.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, a state water official who inspects dairies in the
region was subpoenaed to testify today before a federal grand jury in
Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   The Chino basin, which includes Corona, Ontario and other cities
in western Riverside and San Bernardino counties, is home to more
than 300,000 cows, the largest concentration of dairy animals in the
world. The cows in the Chino basin produce more than 1 billion pounds
of manure annually. Manure-laden runoff from the farms for years has
flowed into tributaries of the Santa Ana River and into the
groundwater that serves more than 2 million people in northern and
central Orange County. Such contamination violates the federal Clean
Water Act, except during extreme rain.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the U.S. attorney's office and EPA would neither
confirm nor deny Tuesday afternoonwhether an investigation is taking
place.</TE>
<TE>   However, a state water official confirmed that EPA investigators
have been inspecting dairies in the area for a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last couple years, they have taken a greater interest in
dairies in general and dairies in our region in particular," said
Kurt Berchtold, assistant executive officer with the Santa Ana
Regional Water Quality Control Board, which is responsible for
regulating the dairies along with the federal agency.</TE>
<TE>   "EPA has been down here and has been doing some inspections for a
while now, for the last couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   Berchtold said that although the board has had problems with the
dairies for as long as it has regulated them, "the general trend has
been that their compliance record has gotten better over time."</TE>
<TE>   The subpoenas indicate that the documents will be reviewed by the
federal grand jury in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, the dairymen
said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Athar Khan, a dairy inspector with the Santa Ana
regional water board, has been subpoenaed to testify today before the
grand jury, Berchtold said. Attempts to reach Khan were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Richard Cutler, whose name appears on the
subpoenas, declined to comment. He was involved in several criminal
prosecutions of dairy farmers in California's Central Valley,
including one that sent a man to jail for 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Officials representing the dairymen expressed concern about the
subpoenas, which request documents relating to waste discharge
permits, notices of violation, manure handling and related topics.</TE>
<TE>   In the California Milk Producers Council's weekly newsletter,
attorney David Albers said, "We would strongly recommend that if you
are served with such a subpoena, that you immediately seek legal
counsel prior to communicating with the United States attorneys or
their agents prosecuting the case."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Feenstra, general manager of the council, said he believes
that up to 11 area dairymen have received subpoenas.</TE>
<TE>   He said that regional water board officials understand how winter
rains can wash contaminants into streams.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials know less about the area, and about recent
construction above the dairies that has increased the runoff problem,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The EPA is missing a lot," Feenstra said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're missing an opportunity to work with the industry and work
with other regulatory agencies to do the right thing, and to work
with the industry to benefit clean water, and to benefit the Santa
Ana River, rather than send out subpoenas."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Marsh, chief executive of Western United Dairyman, said
the industry has made great strides in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really taken an active role in getting dairymen involved in
quality-assurance programs, which teach environmental stewardship,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As we've made this kind of sea change in the way we've been
dairying in the state of California ... it's kind of frustrating that
[the EPA is] going back 10 years for potential problems."</TE>

<HD>FBI Arrests 12, Seizes 10 Tons of Pot</HD>
<DH>Crime: The raids at 22 Southland sites climax an 18-month
probe. 'This is big,' agent says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the largest marijuana smuggling rings in the United States has
been broken up with the seizure of more than 10 tons of the drug,
including more than three tons at a single residence in Downey,
federal authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came only hours after nearly 250 law enforcement
officers, including FBI SWAT teams from as far away as Washington,
D.C., raided 22 locations in Los Angeles, Lynwood and Downey.</LD>
<LD>   The raids, authorities said, followed an 18-month investigation
into a drug operation that distributed up to 40 tons of marijuana
each year to New York, Indiana, Florida and other locations
nationwide. Arrested in the sweeps Tuesday were a dozen members of a
Los Angeles-based ring that authorities said has direct connections
to the cartel of one of Mexico's alleged drug kingpins, Ismael
Zambada.</LD>
<TE>   "This is big," said Richard Garcia, special agent in charge of the
FBI's Criminal Division in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the command and distribution of marijuana in the
United States, this is one of the top 10 groups during the past
decade," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury indictment handed down last week alleges that
the ring, operating since at least July 2000, purchased huge
quantities of marijuana from various suppliers in Mexico, including
Zambada, for distribution throughout the United States.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Mexican authorities believe that the 53-year-old drug
lord, nicknamed "El Mayo," is the man rival drug kingpin Ramon
Arellano Felix was attempting to kill when Arellano was shot by
police last month in Mazatlan.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. operation dismantled Tuesday, authorities alleged, also
may be linked to three drug killings in this country, although no
charges have been filed in those cases.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged ringleader of the drug distribution network is Jose
Manuel Barraza Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Lynwood man, according to the grand jury
indictment, stored the Mexican shipments of marijuana in "stash
houses" throughout Los Angeles before distributing the drug across
the country through the mail or in 1,000-pound tractor-trailer
shipments.</TE>
<TE>   Labeling the huge truck shipments as paper products or electronics
and disguising the marijuana smell with vinegar, baking soda and
other chemicals, the group moved vast quantities of marijuana month
after month, said the FBI's Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and local authorities said Tuesday that Barraza's
operation was uncovered after a shipping company in Indianapolis
reported receiving a "suspicious package" from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That package, received in July 2000, contained 500 pounds of
marijuana, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was nicknamed "Operation Jaguar" after its
purported ringleader was seen driving one of the luxury vehicles,
Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   As the investigation unfolded, authorities alleged, Barraza, his
parents, a younger brother and others moved large shipments of
marijuana with no apparent fear of detection.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, Barraza last August allegedly spoke
by phone with Tigran Madzharyan, owner of a Los Angeles-based
shipping company, to discuss shipping an unspecified quantity of
marijuana to New York.</TE>
<TE>   After the shipment arrived on Aug. 8, the indictment claims,
Barraza told his brother, Richard Barraza, to store the marijuana in
a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several weeks, the indictment said, the drug ring
shipped several more tons of marijuana to locations including New
York, and arranged for payments from the drug proceeds to be
delivered to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In all, authorities said Tuesday, more than 10 tons of marijuana,
41 kilograms of cocaine and more than $1 million in drug proceeds
have been seized in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   More than three tons of marijuana were seized Tuesday at a
two-story pink house about a block from an elementary school in
Downey.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they had occasionally seen a black SUV and a white
truck pull up to the house in the middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   They said that several men in their 20s and 30s frequented the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a funny idea about that house," one neighbor said Tuesday.
"There was never any women there."</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor said, "They drove the best cars."</TE>
<TE>   More than half a dozen FBI SWAT teams took part in the raids
because of information that the "stash houses" holding the marijuana
shipments were guarded by armed employees of the drug operation.</TE>
<TE>   Though that did not prove to be true, Garcia said, authorities did
confiscate a small arsenal of weapons, including AK-47s, during the
raids.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Barraza, those arrested Tuesday included his parents,
Manuel, 61, and Maria, 57, of Lynwood; Madzharyan, 23, of North
Hollywood; Javier Bobadilla-Tovar, 42, of South Gate; Luis Eduardo
Valdez-Venegas, 26, of Lynwood; Edna Cardenas, 23, of Indianapolis;
Eduardo Ramirez-Gonzalez, 37, and Carmen Machada, 23, both of
Nashville; Guadalupe Sosa-Carranza, 35, of Palmdale; Gabriel Rios,
30, of Fontana, and Maria Rodriguez, 32, of Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   Being sought and considered fugitives, the FBI said, are Barraza's
brother, Richard, 20, of Lynwood; Aminta Basurto, 30, of Los Angeles;
and Roberto Davila, 35, of El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Osuna Guzman, 36, of San Gabriel and Franklin Cardenas, 23,
of Indianapolis are in state custody.</TE>
<TE>   All the defendants have been charged with conspiracy to import and
distribute marijuana, charges that carry prison terms of 10 years to
life.</TE>

<HD>Views Emerge in Nixon Rift</HD>
<DH>Politics: The question is whether the library board or the
family should control a bequest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER, JOHN J. GOLDMAN and PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her first public comments about the legal feud with her sister,
Julie Nixon Eisenhower said she was distressed about the dispute but
said she is acting in the best interests of her father's library.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very heartbreaking because I love my sister very much,"
Eisenhower told about 1,000 people Monday night at a speaking
engagement in Redondo Beach. "I've had a terrible weekend, but I am
here."</LD>
<LD>   The rift between Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, the
once-tightknit sisters who caught the nation's attention during the
Nixon White House years, was revealed in a pair of lawsuits the Nixon
Foundation recently filed to collect a bequest from the late Bebe
Rebozo, a longtime friend of the former president.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Cox's attorney accused library officials of dividing
the sisters in an effort to gain access to Rebozo's bequest.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been heartbreaking for Tricia that the library has
sought to drive a wedge between the sisters by commencing litigation
based on false allegations and then trying the case in the press,"
said Richard Grabowski, an Orange County lawyer representing Cox.</TE>
<TE>   "It is fair to say what the library is trying to accomplish
through this litigation is trying to overturn the explicit wishes of
Mr. Rebozo."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over the bequest, which is estimated to be worth as
much as $20 million, is rooted in a deep philosophical divide over
who is best suited to preserve the Nixon legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower, 53, wants the foundation board to control the money.
Cox, 56, adamantly disagrees, saying Rebozo wanted his gift in the
hands of the Nixon family.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower on Monday spoke briefly with her older sister, saying
she was crushed that the disagreement spilled into court. But she
said the foundation needed to take legal action to ensure it retains
control over the bequest.</TE>
<TE>   At a speaking engagement in Thousand Oaks Tuesday night,
Eisenhower acknowledged the rift with her sister but said the two
will work out their differences. "I will simply say that I love my
sister," Eisenhower said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tricia and I have always been close."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the library, she said, "My goal is that the Rebozo trust
go directly to the Nixon endowment.... We are privately funded, so
every dollar counts."</TE>
<TE>   Her comments came four days after the sisters' legal battle became
public.</TE>
<TE>   But friends and library officials said the feud has been going on
since the mid-1990s. Several sources close to the sisters said they
have barely spoken for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo, who made millions in Florida real estate and other
ventures, left 65% of his estate to the Richard Nixon Library &amp;
Birthplace under the caveat that all expenditures be approved by
Nixon's daughters and another longtime Nixon friend, Robert
Abplanalp.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower and Cox have been unable to agree on how the money
should be controlled, leaving the estate tied up in Florida probate
court.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Cox refused to sign a complex legal agreement supported
by her sister and Abplanalp that would send the money to the
foundation's permanent endowment and limit spending to 5% per year.</TE>
<TE>   Cox offered an alternative that would give the sisters and
Abplanalp the power to distribute the money, including to outside
charities, unless the foundation board met to overrule such a
decision within 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Rebozo's trust agreement is very clear. It says Patricia,
Julie and Mr. Abplanalp will direct how the funds will be used on
behalf of the library," said Grabowski, a partner in the Orange
County office of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue. "The reason for this
provision in his will is that Mr. Rebozo did not trust John Taylor,
the library's executive director, to properly use the funds on behalf
of the library."</TE>
<TE>   Library Executive Director John H. Taylor declined to comment
Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Knott's Ride Blamed in Death</HD>
<DH>Accident: A state report faults an inadequate restraint
system on the Perilous Plunge. The victim's size is also cited as a
contributing factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State investigators Tuesday blamed inadequate safety restraints for
the death of a 40-year-old Duarte woman who flew out of a thrill ride
at Knott's Berry Farm.</LD>
<LD>   Lori Mason-Larez fell to her death from the Perilous Plunge water
ride--billed as the world's steepest and highest flume ride--even
though both her lap bar and seat belt were in place.</LD>
<LD>   The 90-second ride carries as many as 24 passengers on a track up
a hill, around a corner and down a 115-foot, 75-degree drop at speeds
of up to 50 mph.</LD>
<TE>   As a result of its six-month investigation, the Department of
Occupational Safety and Health ordered a sweeping review and analysis
of the Perilous Plunge and a new training program for park employees
before it can reopen.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said the Buena Park venue should either change its
safety restraints or restrict the types of people who can ride.
Mason-Larez weighed 292 pounds, which investigators said was a
contributing factor in the Sept. 21 accident.</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview, state officials said that even average-sized
people could be at risk on the ride.</TE>
<TE>   "We think they need to go over everything one more time," said Len
Welsh, the state's special counsel for regulatory development.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not convinced this is just an issue for a person larger
than the average human being. We're not certain that it couldn't have
happened to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Falfas, general manager of Knott's Berry Farm, called the
state report thorough and fair and pledged to do whatever it takes to
make the ride safe.</TE>
<TE>   "This company is going to make sure that we have a restraint
system that is effective for everybody that is permitted on that
ride," Falfas said.</TE>
<TE>   "This death has affected myself along with the operators that work
here.... This ride will not operate until it meets my standards. I
won't do this again. I'm going to force the manufacturer to do what's
acceptable, and I'm sure what's acceptable to me will be acceptable
to the state."</TE>
<TE>   Sandor Kernacs, president of Intamin Ltd., the company that
designed and manufactured the Perilous Plunge, had not read the state
findings Tuesday afternoon but defended the safety and design of the
ride.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the safest restraint system on any water ride anywhere in
the world," said Kernacs, who said that if Mason-Larez had been
holding on, she would not have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of Mason-Larez declined to comment Tuesday, but the
family's Los Angeles attorney, Stephen Mancini, said the report
reaffirms the family's position that the ride was unsafe and that
Mason-Larez was not warned that her size could increase the danger.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the mechanical findings, Mancini said, the report also
reinforces "just how tragic ... this loss really was."</TE>
<TE>   The mother of five was visiting the park with her family. Her
niece and several of her children were seated next to her on the ride
when she flew out.</TE>
<TE>   The state found that in addition to the ride's forces pulling
Mason-Larez out of her seat, the position of the seat belt and lap
belt and the size and weight of the victim all contributed to the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, investigators determined that:</TE>
<TE>   * The seat belt was buckled and the lap bar was down, though they
might not have been in an optimal position;</TE>
<TE>   * Neither manufacturer Intamin nor Knott's had written
instructions for ride operators handling passengers whose physical
characteristics might threaten their safety;</TE>
<TE>   * Even though it may not have made a difference in the accident,
ride operators may not have complied with park procedures for
checking lap bars; and</TE>
<TE>   * Warning signs about the ride were placed in such a way that
passengers might not see them.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed against Knott's Berry Farm and Intamin is
scheduled for trial in June.</TE>
<TE>   The Perilous Plunge has an individual T-shaped lap bar, a seat
belt and a separate bar for the passenger to hold, called a grab bar.</TE>
<TE>   The warning signs tell passengers to hold onto the grab bar, and
Intamin president Kernacs said that if Mason-Larez had been doing
that, she would have been safe.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody holds onto the grab bar, they will not get out of the
ride," Kernacs said.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer's own publicity photos, however, picture
screaming passengers with their hands in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Some witnesses said Mason-Larez's hands were in the air, but
investigators did not reach a definitive conclusion. There were no
signs of rider misconduct, Welsh said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "it shouldn't matter. That ride needs to be designed
so that you don't have to hold on."</TE>

<HD>Knott's Ride Blamed in Death</HD>
<DH>Accident: A state report faults an inadequate restraint
system on the Perilous Plunge. The victim's size is also cited as a
contributing factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State investigators Tuesday blamed inadequate safety restraints for
the death of a 40-year-old Duarte woman who flew out of a thrill ride
at Knott's Berry Farm.</LD>
<LD>   Lori Mason-Larez fell to her death from the Perilous Plunge water
ride--billed as the world's steepest and highest flume ride--even
though both her lap bar and seat belt were in place.</LD>
<LD>   The 90-second ride carries as many as 24 passengers on a track up
a hill, around a corner and down a 115-foot, 75-degree drop at speeds
of up to 50 mph.</LD>
<TE>   As a result of its six-month investigation, the Department of
Occupational Safety and Health ordered a sweeping review and analysis
of the Perilous Plunge and a new training program for park employees
before it can reopen.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said the Buena Park venue should either change its
safety restraints or restrict the types of people who can ride.
Mason-Larez weighed 292 pounds, which investigators said was a
contributing factor in the Sept. 21 accident.</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview, state officials said that even average-sized
people could be at risk on the ride.</TE>
<TE>   "We think they need to go over everything one more time," said Len
Welsh, the state's special counsel for regulatory development.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not convinced this is just an issue for a person larger
than the average human being. We're not certain that it couldn't have
happened to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Falfas, general manager of Knott's Berry Farm, called the
state report thorough and fair and pledged to do whatever it takes to
make the ride safe.</TE>
<TE>   "This company is going to make sure that we have a restraint
system that is effective for everybody that is permitted on that
ride," Falfas said.</TE>
<TE>   "This death has affected myself along with the operators that work
here.... This ride will not operate until it meets my standards. I
won't do this again. I'm going to force the manufacturer to do what's
acceptable, and I'm sure what's acceptable to me will be acceptable
to the state."</TE>
<TE>   Sandor Kernacs, president of Intamin Ltd., the company that
designed and manufactured the Perilous Plunge, had not read the state
findings Tuesday afternoon but defended the safety and design of the
ride.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the safest restraint system on any water ride anywhere in
the world," said Kernacs, who said that if Mason-Larez had been
holding on, she would not have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of Mason-Larez declined to comment Tuesday, but the
family's Los Angeles attorney, Stephen Mancini, said the report
reaffirms the family's position that the ride was unsafe and that
Mason-Larez was not warned that her size could increase the danger.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the mechanical findings, Mancini said, the report also
reinforces "just how tragic ... this loss really was."</TE>
<TE>   The mother of five was visiting the park with her family. Her
niece and several of her children were seated next to her on the ride
when she flew out.</TE>
<TE>   The state found that in addition to the ride's forces pulling
Mason-Larez out of her seat, the position of the seat belt and lap
belt and the size and weight of the victim all contributed to the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, investigators determined that:</TE>
<TE>   * The seat belt was buckled and the lap bar was down, though they
might not have been in an optimal position;</TE>
<TE>   * Neither manufacturer Intamin nor Knott's had written
instructions for ride operators handling passengers whose physical
characteristics might threaten their safety;</TE>
<TE>   * Even though it may not have made a difference in the accident,
ride operators may not have complied with park procedures for
checking lap bars; and</TE>
<TE>   * Warning signs about the ride were placed in such a way that
passengers might not see them.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed against Knott's Berry Farm and Intamin is
scheduled for trial in June.</TE>
<TE>   The Perilous Plunge has an individual T-shaped lap bar, a seat
belt and a separate bar for the passenger to hold, called a grab bar.</TE>
<TE>   The warning signs tell passengers to hold onto the grab bar, and
Intamin president Kernacs said that if Mason-Larez had been doing
that, she would have been safe.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody holds onto the grab bar, they will not get out of the
ride," Kernacs said.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer's own publicity photos, however, picture
screaming passengers with their hands in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Some witnesses said Mason-Larez's hands were in the air, but
investigators did not reach a definitive conclusion. There were no
signs of rider misconduct, Welsh said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "it shouldn't matter. That ride needs to be designed
so that you don't have to hold on."</TE>
<TE>   Intamin has been previously criticized for its restraint systems.
In 1999, a 37-year-old man weighing more than 300 pounds slipped from
an Intamin roller coaster at Six Flags Darien Lakes in New York. He
was injured on Superman: Ride of Steel when he fell about eight feet
from the ride, which was equipped with a T-shaped lap bar but no seat
belt.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1999, a 12-year-old boy died in a fall from the Drop Zone
Stunt Tower at Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara. He slipped
from a shoulder harness during a 22-story free fall.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Perilous Plunge accident, some ride engineers
and safety consultants questioned whether a woman of Mason-Larez's
girth and weight should have ever been allowed to board the ride.</TE>
<TE>   In the report, Knott's Berry Farm and Intamin officials seem to
disagree on various training, maintenance and operational issues
related to large guests. Intamin said heavy guests should not be
seated in the fifth and sixth rows of the 24-passenger boats.
Mason-Larez was seated in the fourth row.</TE>
<TE>   Kernacs told investigators that if the lap bar only "came down to
the belly" or "a fatty portion of the guest's body" and did not rest
on the lap or hips, the guest must be refused entry to the ride.</TE>
<TE>   But none of those policies or guidelines are included in the
manufacturer's manual, the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Falfas said he called Intamin on Tuesday and hoped to discuss the
issue further today in order to begin work soon on a new restraint
system. Once that system is in place, engineers will test it to
determine whether limits for size and weight should be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Pribonic, an independent ride engineer and licensed ride
inspector, said that an over-the-shoulder harness would probably work
well on the Perilous Plunge, in addition to restricting certain
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The 75-degree drop is "almost like tipping you upside down,"
Pribonic said. "It's almost perpendicular, and a lap bar [and seat
belt] just may not be enough. This tragic incident has already proven
that the combination is not what you need."</TE>
<TE>   Under a state law that took effect in January 2000, amusement
parks are required to report injury accidents to the state Department
of Occupational Safety and Health, which has the authority to
investigate the accidents and order safety changes.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Rematch With Padres Is Calm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEORIA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>More than seven innings of the Angels' 11-2 victory over the San
Diego Padres on Tuesday night were played without the slightest hint
of lingering bad blood between teams that engaged in two
bench-clearing brawls 10 days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   But after Angel pitcher Scot Shields hit Damian Jackson on the
helmet with a curveball in the bottom of the eighth, and Alan Embree
of the Padres hit Larry Barnes with a pitch in the ninth, home plate
umpire Ted Barrett warned Angel Manager Mike Scioscia and Padre
Manager Bruce Bochy.</LD>
<LD>   So when Angel pitcher Mickey Callaway plunked Tom Lampkin on a
3-and-2 count with two out and the bases loaded in the bottom of the
ninth, Callaway and Scioscia were ejected from the exhibition.</LD>
<TE>   No players rushed the mound or left the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said that none of the pitchers from either team showed
intent.</TE>
<TE>   "That was ridiculous," Scioscia said of the ejections.</TE>
<TE>   The drama at the end overshadowed an impressive if uneventful
start by Angel right-hander Aaron Sele, who was facing the Padres for
the first time since March 9, when he hit outfielder Ryan Klesko with
a pitch that set off the first brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Padre first baseman Phil Nevin said that Sele promised last year
to hit Klesko in retaliation for perceived showboating after a home
run, a charge Sele has denied.</TE>
<TE>   Angel third baseman Troy Glaus charged the mound after he was
nearly hit by Padre pitcher Bobby Jones the next inning, setting off
the second brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Four Padre players and three Angel players were suspended for
regular-season games or fined for their roles in the fights.</TE>
<TE>   Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio was suspended for six games,
Glaus was suspended for two and Sele was fined.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was suspended for seven games and Klesko for five. Nevin and
outfielder Ron Gant were fined.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio and Klesko are appealing their suspensions, which were
handed down by Bob Watson, baseball's dean of discipline.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Sele gave up one run, two hits and struck out two in
five innings that were absent of drama.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect anything different," Sele said of the calm mood
on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Sele and Nevin joked at first base after Sele singled in the first
inning against Brian Tollberg. After he came out of the game in the
sixth inning, Spiezio said all the principals from the March 9
incidents had moved forward.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in a brawl, it's not a personal thing," Spiezio said.
"The guys are just wearing a different uniform that day."</TE>
<TE>   Nevin, who left the game after seven innings, couldn't resist
taking a good-natured shot at Sele.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed he's got pretty good control, didn't he?" Nevin said.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Shawn Wooten underwent surgery at the Kerlan- Jobe
Clinic in Los Angeles to repair ligament damage in his right thumb.
He is expected to be out until the All-Star break, Angel spokesman
Tim Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Norman Zemel, who removed torn cartilage in Wooten's left
wrist last September, also performed Tuesday's surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten will have sutures removed in seven to 10 days and will have
a pin removed three to four weeks after the sutures are removed. He
will begin rehabilitation in six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon hit a run-scoring double in the first inning and a
two-run homer in the second. Adam Kennedy also hit a two-run homer in
the second. Klesko hit a fly ball to left field on the first pitch he
saw from Sele in the first inning. He also flied out against Sele in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have today off but left-hander Scott Schoeneweis will
pitch in a game at minor league camp and Jose Molina will be his
catcher.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortstop Barry Larkin was bothered by his groin during practice
Tuesday, leaving the Cincinnati Reds unsure of when he'll play again.</LD>
<LD>   Larkin, 37, tore his groin last season and had surgery to repair a
hernia. The groin began bothering him at training camp, prompting
Manager Bob Boone to keep him out of games as a precaution. He hasn't
played since Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors believe Larkin is bothered by the mesh used to repair the
hernia.</LD>
<TE>   "He took ground balls and swung the bat real well, but he felt it
a little bit," Boone said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Gromek, who won 123 games in a 17-year major league career
and helped Cleveland win the 1948 World Series, died March 12 of
complications from diabetes, his wife Jeanette said. He was 82.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore designated hitter David Segui and center fielder Chris
Singleton could be held out of games for the rest of spring training
because of sore Achilles' tendons, but the Orioles expect they'll be
ready by opening day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee outfielder Rondell White could make his first
appearance of the exhibition season early next week. White has not
played this spring after straining his left rib cage Feb. 25.</TE>

<HD>Williams' Other Side Gets the Best of Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaun Powell of Newsday observes that Jayson Williams' once-glamorous
life has changed from dream to nightmare since the former NBA player
was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of his limo
driver:</LD>
<LD>   "Before Feb. 14, anyone would've swapped places with Jayson
Williams. Today, any volunteers?</LD>
<LD>   "At least Williams is alive, which is more than can be said for
Gus Christofi, [who was] shot at Williams' estate on a bloody
beginning to Valentine's Day. But in every respect, the life Williams
once knew is now dead, pending the outcome of his upcoming trial.</LD>
<TE>   "Until the facts and the witnesses speak, that's all we know.
There are charges of tampering with evidence and witnesses as
prosecutors paint a picture of Williams frantically trying to create
a cover-up, to protect his behind and his bank account. Perhaps he
accidentally shot Christofi, panicked and became frightened at the
possibility of prosecution. Perhaps none of that occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "But this much is clear: A former player with a heart bigger than
his laugh is accused of allowing his reckless side to ruin him."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for three-point baskets in an
NCAA men's tournament game?</TE>
<TE>   What regrets? Barbara Barker of Newsday started thinking about
who's missing from this year's NCAA tournament:</TE>
<TE>   "All those silly NBA players who decided to skip out of college
early--or skip it altogether--must really be bummed, now that March
Madness has started.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't you see them yearning for the purity of NCAA competition?
Pining for that place where coaches are molders of men, not jugglers
of egos? Itching to join a system in which players get no pay--in
theory, at least--but make oodles of dough for their alma maters?
Looking back sentimentally to all the trappings of the college game,
where cheerleaders are perky, not trashy?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, right. And then those silly NBA players flip the channel
from CBS to CNBC to check their investment portfolios."</TE>
<TE>   Missing in action: Barker points out that the would-be seniors
playing in the NBA include Rashard Lewis, Al Harrington, Mike Miller,
Corey Maggette, Stromile Swift, Keyon Dooling, Quentin Richardson,
Troy Murphy, Richard Jefferson, Erick Barkley and Joel Przybilla.</TE>
<TE>   Three of a kind: Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, the three-time French
Open tennis champion, has turned to a new form of triathlon to help
him recover from hip surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends and family have scheduled a dominoes, snooker and
cards triathlon to try to keep me occupied," said Kuerten, who
usually passes the time surfing in his hometown of Florianopolis. "I
am a very eclectic guy, but right now I am seeing the other side of
life."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jeff Fryer of Loyola Marymount, 11, in the Lions'
149-115 victory over Michigan in a second-round game in 1990. It
remains the highest-scoring game in the history of the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Regina Jacobs has an interesting explanation as to
why, at 38 and in the twilight of her track career, she plans to take
up the steeplechase.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted an event that more clearly fit my life, with lots of
hurdles," she said. "I figure if I master that before I leave track
and field, the rest of my life will be smooth sailing."</TE>

<HD>Brown Survives Ugly Loss</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KISSIMMEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Pitcher Kevin Brown had to be escorted off the Osceola County Stadium
mound and to the clubhouse by a trainer in the third inning of
Tuesday's 12-0 exhibition loss to the Houston Astros.</LD>
<LD>   Don't worry, Brown's surgically repaired right elbow is fine. But
the outside of his right knee was bruised after Daryle Ward's one-hop
smash nailed Brown in the leg, knocking him out of an unsightly game
in which the ace right-hander gave up eight runs--three of them
earned--and six hits in 21/3 innings.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who threw 44 pitches, 31 for strikes, declined to speak
with reporters, and Manager Jim Tracy said the injury did not appear
serious. An X-ray of Brown's knee didn't show any damage.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pleased that arm-wise, he was very good, very firm," Tracy
said. "He was throwing 92-94 mph in the first inning. And he got
enough outs to pitch at least four innings."</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Alex Cora booted Craig Biggio's grounder to start the
first, and Brad Ausmus (single), Jeff Bagwell (two-run double), Lance
Berkman (RBI double) and Ward (RBI single) followed with hits. An
error by second baseman Jeff Reboulet and two errors by third baseman
Phil Hiatt paved the way for a seven-run third inning, which included
Morgan Ensberg's three-run homer off reliever Matt Herges.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's only spring training, but we were horrible," catcher
Paul Lo Duca said. "We should be embarrassed by the way we played
today."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy thought some choppy infield dirt contributed to the Dodger's
five errors. A bad-hop grounder during batting practice hit Houston
shortstop Adam Everett in the right thumb, knocking him out for two
days.</TE>
<TE>   "That field was very rugged, to say the least," Tracy said. "It
doesn't rain for a while, and the [infield] clay just bakes. The
ground was as hard as the turnpike we're going to drive back on."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy remains "very hopeful" that Brown, who has made only three
spring starts, will be ready to pitch opening day against San
Francisco on April 2, even though Brown is well behind the team's
other starters. Tracy will go to Plan B--most likely Hideo Nomo--if
Brown hasn't built up enough stamina to open the season.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of when Brown pitches his first game, he does appear to
be making steady progress.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of Brown's pitches and the strength of his arm look
good," pitching coach Jim Colborn said. "He just needs to put a glove
on his knee."</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhisa Ishii's next spring start has been pushed back
indefinitely while the Dodgers try to realign his throwing program
with the one he used in Japan. Ishii, who gave up six runs and six
hits, including three homers, Saturday against the Yankees, threw 60
pitches in the bullpen Tuesday and will throw on the side again
today.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way he trained in Japan," said Colborn, who spent four
years as a pitching coach in Japan. "That's the way the Japanese
pitchers are used to conditioning. I've seen them throw bullpen,
bullpen, bullpen, then go five innings in a game. He could take four
days off, throw more bullpens, throw seven innings in another game
and be ready for the season."</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Shawn Green started at first base, an indication
that reserve outfielder/first baseman Dante Bichette, who is batting
.200, does not have a roster spot locked up.</TE>
<TE>   "If Eric Karros gets hurt, who plays first base if Dante doesn't
make the team?" Tracy said. "I'm not 100% convinced [Bichette] is on
this club. He has to convince me. As a result, I'm going to use Dante
over the next week and a half in a similar fashion that I'd use him
during the regular season, as a pinch-hitter off the bench."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby, who also is recovering from elbow surgery, had his
best outing of the spring, giving up one run and six hits in 32/3
innings. Ashby threw 52 pitches, and was happy with his command.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something to build on," Ashby said. "I threw pitches close
to where I wanted to throw them. I'm trusting my stuff more,
concentrating more on location, not taking for granted that my
pitches are going to go where I want them."</TE>
<TE>   Odalis Perez pitched five scoreless innings in a triple-A game at
Vero Beach, Fla., giving up three hits, striking out four and walking
one.... The Dodgers optioned infielders Jorge Nunez and Joe Thurston
to triple-A Las Vegas, and pitchers Mike Johnson, Dennis Springer and
Todd Williams were re-assigned to minor league camp.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Adventure Quest: Egypt Mountain Bike Exodus"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Outdoor Life Network, tonight, 9 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Hans Rey regards his mountain bike as a passport with pedals and
he looks at the world "as one big obstacle course to conquer."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, the passport has been stamped in Egypt and the obstacle
course is the rugged Sinai Peninsula and its namesake peak. Rey will
follow in the footsteps of Moses, climbing the Steps of Repentance to
the summit where God is said to have delivered the Ten Commandments.</TE>
<TE>   Then Rey will become the first to make bicycle tracks over those
footsteps, bouncing down all 3,000 of the steps, not stopping until
he reaches the Red Sea. After which the former world champion will
take a well-deserved plunge.</TE>
<TE>   His is an entertaining Egyptian odyssey, to be sure. Rey is a
personable showman who gives viewers a glimpse into the Bedouin
culture and lifestyle from a unique perspective: the eyes of a man
whose philosophy is to "look at a landscape like an artist and
complement what I see with my riding."</TE>
<TE>   Though there is some ceremonious bouncing along in front of the
ancient pyramids and some showing off in the bustling Cairo
marketplace, there also is some incredible trials-style riding over
some of the most rugged and spectacular terrain imaginable.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, everyone he passed along the way seemed genuinely
impressed by his ability to negotiate such a seemingly unridable
landscape--everyone, of course, but the camels.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Goaltender Fiset Traded to the Canadiens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings were finally successful Tuesday in their season-long quest
to unload goaltender Stephane Fiset.</LD>
<LD>   Fiset, who had spent the entire season with the Kings' American
Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H., and has been hampered by knee
injuries the last two years, was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for
future considerations.</LD>
<LD>   With a contract that pays him $2.7 million this season, with a
club option for next season at $2.85 million, Fiset, 31, was at once
expendable to the Kings and unattractive to other teams because of
his salary and recent injury problems.</LD>
<TE>   After playing in only seven games with the Kings last season
because of a sprained left knee, an injury that led to the Kings'
late-season acquisition of Felix Potvin, Fiset played in 23 games for
the Manchester Monarchs this season, compiling a 7-7-6 record and
3.13 goals-against average.</TE>
<TE>   A one-time NHL regular who helped the Colorado Avalanche win the
Stanley Cup championship in 1996, Fiset is 164-152-44 with 16
shutouts in 388 NHL games. His numbers in 200 games with the Kings
from the start of the 1996-97 season through last season included an
80-85-22 record, 2.83 GAA and 10 shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   "Moving him now will save us some dollars between now and the end
of the year on his salary," King General Manager Dave Taylor said,
"but it also gives him a chance to play on the NHL level."</TE>
<TE>   If the Canadiens do not exercise the option on Fiset's contract
for next season, a good possibility, the Kings will receive no
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Johnson, who left Monday night's 3-2 victory over the San
Jose Sharks after suffering a cut above his left eye, underwent
surgery Tuesday to repair damage in his right eye. A first-period hit
sent Johnson face-first into the glass, opening the cut over his left
eye and tearing the retina in his right.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran winger is expected to be sidelined at least 10 days.</TE>

<HD>A Force of Two</HD>
<DH>Tough Guy Belanger Keeps Perspective After Scoring Twice</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've just scored for the first time in 16 months, netting two
improbable goals in arguably the Kings' most important victory of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Belanger, where's the joy?</LD>
<LD>   "How excited do you get?" asked the low-key Belanger, whose first
goals since Nov. 11, 2000, fueled a 3-2 victory over the San Jose
Sharks on Monday night but brought not even the tiniest of smiles to
his face. "Do you get overly excited about two goals? I'm obviously
excited, but...."</LD>
<TE>   But what?</TE>
<TE>   Other than goaltenders Felix Potvin and Jamie Storr, Belanger was
the least likely King to score a goal in a crucial game.</TE>
<TE>   Or any game, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   It had been 56 games since Belanger last scored a goal.</TE>
<TE>   And his last multi-goal game? In 228 previous NHL games, the
6-foot-4, 231-pound enforcer had never enjoyed even a multi-point
effort.</TE>
<TE>   That all changed when Belanger, after scoring a first-period goal
from the right faceoff circle, took a drop pass from Adam Deadmarsh
in the third and ripped a blast from the left point that eluded
goaltender Evgeni Nabokov.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after taking stitches to close a cut above his right eye,
the result of a high-sticking penalty against Shark captain Owen
Nolan that set up Deadmarsh's game-winning power-play goal, Belanger
was nonplussed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a tough year," he explained Tuesday. "That's why,
emotionally, I'm not going to show too much excitement over my goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to keep the same level, don't get too high or too low. Some
nights you get the opportunity, but who knows, next time might be
different. So, if you go in expecting it next time and you don't get
it, do you get down?"</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Belanger, no relation to injured teammate Eric
Belanger, has experienced his share of down time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Signed by the Kings as a free agent last summer after the Boston
Bruins failed to make him a qualifying offer, he was eager to join
his new team after watching the Kings' playoff run on television last
spring.</TE>
<TE>   "My agent talked to a couple teams," he said, "but as soon as L.A.
came into the picture I had my mind made up because I knew they were
a contending team. I wanted to go somewhere where we felt we had a
chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   After suffering an ankle injury in training camp, however,
Belanger rarely made his presence felt as the Kings struggled through
the first half of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say we were down on him," Coach Andy Murray said, "but
we wanted him to play with a little bit more authority."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Murray shared his feelings with him, Belanger got
into a fight with Lance Ward of the Florida Panthers on Jan. 2 at
Staples Center and suffered a broken left thumb, an injury that
sidelined him for two months.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to the lineup March 2 and, according to Murray,
enjoyed his best game of the season Saturday in a 4-3 victory over
the Pittsburgh Penguins.</TE>
<TE>   Best until Monday, that is.</TE>
<TE>   "We like Ken because he brings that physical element to our team,"
said General Manager Dave Taylor, who turned to Belanger last summer
after former King tough guy Stu Grimson spurned the team's offer of a
one-year contract and signed a two-year deal with the Nashville
Predators. "He's big and strong, but he also can skate pretty well
and he's got a tremendous shot.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had some injuries and hasn't played as much as he or we
would like, but it's certainly nice to see him get a couple of goals.
Those guys that battle for you every night, it's nice to see them get
rewarded on the scoreboard."</TE>

<HD>'Weak' Lakers Brushed Aside</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Jackson questions team's mind-set after
114-98 loss to Mavericks. Bryant held to 12.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The 14 misses, they pulled at the corners of Kobe Bryant's eyes, and
thinned his voice.</LD>
<LD>   He tried a grin, but he had set his jaw too tight, so eventually
he just stopped trying, stopped trying to make more of it than it
was, just the worst shooting game of his season was all, and so an
unlikely loss.</LD>
<LD>   "Pfft," he said. "Take the good with the bad."</LD>
<TE>   In their "championship shoes" only two nights before, their coach
had said, the Lakers were dismissed as "weak-minded" by the same man
Tuesday night, beaten as they were by the Dallas Mavericks, 114-98,
at American Airlines Center, before a hysterical sell-out crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks defeated the Lakers for the first time in eight
games, for the fourth time in 45, in part because Bryant took 18
shots and missed all but four of them, and in part because Steve Nash
ripped them for 30 points. The Mavericks, for the moment, lightened
their dependence on three-pointers, went harder to the basket, and,
defensively, fell over backwards whenever Shaquille O'Neal came
around.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 32 points and took 10 rebounds, but foul trouble
took him off the floor for much of the third quarter, when the Lakers
were outscored, 33-16, and the Mavericks scored nearly one-third of
those points on the fastbreak.</TE>
<TE>   "They ran it down our throats in the third quarter," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   And so the Laker winning streak ended at five, and their
late-season push to the postseason stalled at 12 wins in 14 games,
with another difficult game tonight in San Antonio, where the Spurs
have been waiting since Saturday. The Lakers fell out of their
first-place tie atop the Pacific Division with the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're weak-minded right now," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.
"We're weak in mind and in body."</TE>
<TE>   Only Rick Fox, who scored 16 points, had a steady scoring touch
behind O'Neal, and the Lakers were outrebounded, 56-45, and 19-11 on
the offensive side.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, they played well," Bryant said with a look that
suggested he didn't really believe it. "We just gotta take this one
in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a loss. Just move on to San Antonio. It's probably a big win
for [the Mavericks], but we didn't play well and we let the game slip
away in the third quarter."</TE>
<TE>   That would be fair to assume. Their owner, Mark Cuban, high-fived
the starters taken from the floor by Coach Don Nelson when the game
was in hand. And, this time, it was the Mavericks who pumped their
fists and smiled at each other and, finally, believed they could
stand with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We won," Nash said, "and that's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, of course, would not allow it to be that uncomplicated.
He drove the Lakers to the very end, with Bryant on the floor chasing
Maverick reserves, trying to foul with 18 seconds left and the
deficit 17 points. With 17.7 seconds left, Jackson called one last
timeout, and Laker players grinned at the show, and the crowd
groaned. Indeed, Jackson was able to pull within 16 points of the
Mavericks, if that were the goal. It seemed an odd risk with Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to prepare for some postseason play," Jackson said,
straight-faced. "We're not going to go down without a scrap ... and
just submit."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the over-the-top coaching was meant for the Mavericks or
the Lakers, Jackson said, "For us."</TE>
<TE>   No one begrudged him that.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, that's our coach," guard Lindsey Hunter said. "We stand
behind him, like, 'OK, let's roll.'"</TE>
<TE>   Said Bryant, who had a season-low 12 points: "I don't know. You
have to ask Phil that. Us, as players, our job is to play hard all
the way to the buzzer."</TE>
<TE>   Forty-eight hours after they heaved 40 three-pointers and lost by
a layup, the Mavericks went more aggressively to the rim. Often, Nash
led them there, by penetration or pass, sprung by screens-and-rolls,
around Hunter or Derek Fisher. Raef LaFrentz, the Mavericks' new
center, was accused by Jackson of "flopping," and the referees were
accused by Jackson of buying it. Indeed, O'Neal missed plenty of
short shots, and perhaps he was wary of his tenuous spot.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Bryant reached the fourth quarter with seven points,
having missed all six shots in the third quarter and his last of the
first half. And now, in a playoff series, the Lakers might wonder
about Bryant and the very physical defense played against him by
Adrian Griffin and Greg Buckner. Bryant doubted it, though.</TE>
<TE>   "It was truthfully one of those nights," he said. "I had a couple
shots that rattled around and then came out.</TE>
<TE>   "My rhythm really wasn't there and some of the credit goes to the
defense. The shots were in, but just didn't fall."</TE>

<HD>Russia's Yagudin Skates to Six Perfect Scores</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as he did in the Olympics, Russia's Alexei Yagudin showed why he
is a champion.</LD>
<LD>   Relaxed and exuding confidence with every move, he scored a record
six perfect marks in the men's short program Tuesday in the World
Figure Skating Championships at Nagano, Japan, including the first
for a man in required elements.</LD>
<LD>   "It is easy for me to skate here compared to the Olympics. I felt
like I was going to a show," Yagudin said.</LD>
<TE>   There are eight jumps, spins, steps or combinations in the short
program. Yagudin, who turned 22 on Monday, displayed exactly how to
do them.</TE>
<TE>   He had a textbook quad-triple combination, and his six 6.0 scores
were the highest number an individual has received in a world
championships short program. Yagudin even received a 6.0 in required
elements and a 6.0 for presentation from the Ukrainian judge.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Abt of Russia was second and American Tim Goebel was
third. Both landed quad-triple combinations.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's competition, Michelle Kwan had a nearly flawless
routine to earn top marks in her qualification group.</TE>
<TE>   Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the French judge at the center of the
Olympic figure skating scandal, filed a formal complaint with the
International Skating Union charging that ISU technical committee
chairwoman Sally Stapleford and pairs referee Ron Pfenning "exercised
undue influence" over her and made false accusations.</TE>
<TE>   The ISU plans to hold a hearing April 29-30.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   Denver reached a $775,000, one-year contract agreement with
receiver Rob Moore, who sat out most of the last two seasons in
Arizona because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay re-signed cornerback Brian Kelly to a six-year contract
worth more than $12 million and signed free-agent tight end Marco
Battaglia to a three-year, $3-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   Battaglia played with Cincinnati and Washington last season.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL confirmed that free-agent tackle Victor Riley has been
suspended for one game for violating the league's personal conduct
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, then with Kansas City, was accused of ramming his vehicle
several times into a vehicle occupied by his wife and infant daughter
in May at Overland Park, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Skiing</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Vonn won the men's giant slalom at Olympic Valley, Calif.,
for his first national title and Casey Puckett closed his skiing
career unusually.</TE>
<TE>   Vonn finished the two runs in 1 minute 47.41 seconds in the final
event of the U.S. Alpine Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Vonn took the lead after the first run and held on to beat Tom
Rothrock by 0.24 seconds. Erik Schlopy was third and Bode Miller, who
won a silver medal in the giant slalom in the Salt Lake City
Olympics, was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The race was the final one in a 13-year U.S. team career for
Puckett, who at Salt Lake became the second U.S. male Alpine skier to
compete in four Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Puckett made his final run in a bear costume.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually wanted to wear a gorilla suit. But I wasn't able to
make it to Reno to find a gorilla suit," Puckett said.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Alex Zanardi will return to the Lausitz, Germany, track where he
lost his legs and will symbolically start the German 500 on Sept. 21,
a year after the crash in which he nearly died.</TE>
<TE>   Zanardi lost his legs Sept. 15 during the inaugural CART race in
Germany. The Italian driver has learned to walk on artificial limbs
and has driven a car.</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League rookie Anthony Lazzaro has been released from a
hospital after a three-car crash in the Copper World 200 at Phoenix
on Sunday, but has not been cleared to resume driving.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Henry Bock, the IRL's director of medical services, said he
will reevaluate Lazzaro this week to determine his availability for
Sunday's Yamaha Indy 400 at California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Olympic gold medal sprinter Jon Drummond pleaded not guilty in Los
Angeles to a charge that he transported seven pounds of marijuana
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Drummond, a member of the U.S. 400-meter relay team at the 2000
Sydney Games, is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on the felony
count April 17. He remains free on $20,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested Oct. 23 as he was leaving LAX with a backpack
containing the marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Two corporate groups have teamed to acquire the Major League
Soccer champion San Jose Earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz Entertainment Group, which already owned five of the
MLS's 10 teams, is joining with Silicon Valley Sports &amp;
Entertainment, which has managed the Earthquakes since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Thorpe won the 200-meter freestyle but failed to set a world
mark for the second consecutive night in the Australian swim
championships at Brisbane.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe won six gold medals and set three world records in the
world championships at Fukuoka, Japan, in July. He won the 400 in
Brisbane on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He finished more than a second slower than his Fukuoka world
record time of 1:44.06 in the 200.</TE>
<TE>   Makhtar Ndiaye, a member of the North Charleston Lowgators of the
National Basketball Development League, was questioned by airport
security at Charlotte, N.C., and not allowed to board a US Airways
flight to Huntsville, Ala., on Sunday after allegedly making a
comment a gate agent deemed a security breach.</TE>
<TE>   A passenger on the flight told The Huntsville Times that Ndiaye
used the word "bomb" in a joking manner.</TE>
<TE>   Ndiaye, a native of Senegal, played at North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Someone stole the $15,000 artificial limb that a golfer known as

<HD>Bertuzzi Spoils It for Bure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Todd Bertuzzi knew the New York Rangers would be riding high after
adding six-time All-Star Pavel Bure to their roster.</LD>
<LD>   He was determined to spoil the debut.</LD>
<LD>   Bertuzzi came up with a hat trick and the Vancouver Canucks beat
the Rangers, 3-1, Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<TE>   "Tonight was a big task," Bertuzzi said, "especially with the
Pavel trade."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Jovanovski, who played a solid and physical game against Bure's
linemate, Eric Lindros, also took note of the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of excitement in the air before the game with
Pavel coming to play for New York," he said. "He can really raise the
emotional level for the crowd and the team. We came in there and
played a calm game. We weathered the storm."</TE>
<TE>   Bertuzzi's final goal was scored into an empty net with 8.2
seconds left, giving the Canucks their fifth consecutive victory, all
on the road. Vancouver moved into the eighth and final spot in the
Western Conference playoff race with 77 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt pretty good although, obviously, I'm not satisfied with
the loss," Bure said. "We had lots of chances, we just didn't finish
them. Sometimes that happens."</TE>
<TE>   Bure, acquired from Florida on Monday, gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead
and showed bursts of speed and puck sense not seen with the Rangers
all season.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, he's definitely talented," Lindros said. "He takes lots of
shots, which is good.... I think things are just going to get
better."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Phoenix 2--Byron Dafoe stopped 27 shots at Boston and
the Bruins won their fourth in a row to take over the top spot in the
Eastern Conference with 86 points, one more than Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 5, Ottawa 1--Chris Gratton had a goal and two assists at
Buffalo, N.Y., helping the Sabres move closer to a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Biron stopped 33 shots and Buffalo pulled within two points
of eighth-place Montreal in the East.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Nashville 1--Scott Mellanby and Pavol Demitra scored
in a 2:16 span in the second period at St. Louis, and the Blues won
for the third time in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Johnson made his eighth consecutive start for St. Louis and
made 25 saves.</TE>
<TE>   He assisted on the clincher, a short-handed goal by Chris Pronger
with 3:32 to go.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Ferraro, acquired Monday from Atlanta, played his first game
for the Blues and had a goal and an assist in the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, New York Islanders 2--Cory Cross scored at 2:11 of
overtime and the host Maple Leafs extended their unbeaten streak to
six games.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Yashin scored his 30th goal for the Islanders, who have won
only two of their last eight.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, Colorado 0--Olie Kolzig stopped 21 shots for his
26th career shutout and Peter Bondra had a goal and an assist at
Denver to help the Capitals end a three-game losing streak.</TE>

<DH>Knight's Backyard Foes Don't Say Much, but They Have Become
Good Teachers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A high-arching jump shot over a long set of Cincinnati arms? A
bouncing drive through three Mississippi-sized bodies?</LD>
<LD>   In his backyard, Billy Knight faces stiffer competition.</LD>
<LD>   Literally.</LD>
<TE>   In his backyard, Billy Knight flies past those players as if
they're mannequins.</TE>
<TE>   Because they are.</TE>
<TE>   In his backyard, Billy Knight is no dummy.</TE>
<TE>   The four other guys are.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA tournament is normal stuff for UCLA's hot-shooting guard,
who has grown up marching to the madness of pickup games against
horror-movie props.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wild, man," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   As a quirky L.A. story to accompany a quirky UCLA team to the
Sweet 16 this week, it's perfect.</TE>
<TE>   When Knight was a bench-warming sophomore center at Westchester
High, his father Bill smartly decided his son's only chance at a
college scholarship was through a jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   Billy, at 6 feet 6, was one of the tallest guys on the squad, so
his father decided Billy needed something to shoot over.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of trips to swap meets and hardware stores later, Bill
Knight's son became the only basketball player in town with his own
permanent visiting team: four dummies, all with long arms and great
wheels, patrolling the small Ladera Heights backyard court between
five makeshift baskets.</TE>
<TE>   None of the dummies have names, but they all have game.</TE>
<TE>   One seven-footer has a glaring face and an endless reach.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy's blocked my shot before," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   Another seven-footer has a leather gut and plastic foam wings.</TE>
<TE>   "I got so mad at him once and threw a ball at his face," Knight
said.</TE>
<TE>   There is a 6-foot-9 power forward with the photo of a kick boxer
tattooed on his chest.</TE>
<TE>   "I can bounce off that one," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   And there is a 6-foot guard who can spin and skid.</TE>
<TE>   "He can move," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years, Knight has maneuvered through his midway freak
show while throwing up shots at carnival baskets.</TE>
<TE>   One has a rim that is a few inches too small.</TE>
<TE>   Another sits underneath a dangling string that can only be hit
with a perfectly arched shot.</TE>
<TE>   Underneath it all is a shopping basket filled with balls, one the
size of a pumpkin.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Big Ball," explained Billy. "If you don't shoot Big Ball
perfectly, it won't go in."</TE>
<TE>   When his father set up the dummies, Billy reacted like any typical
teen-ager whose parents have worked and sacrificed to create
something special on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go near the stuff," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the longer he sat on the bench, the more he realized he didn't
have a choice.</TE>
<TE>   "If I wanted a college scholarship, I had to remake my game, I had
to become a shooter," he said. "I figured the dummies couldn't hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Well, actually, they could hurt, especially when he bounced off
their boxing-bag torsos on the way to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   But he started using them anyway.</TE>
<TE>   He would shoot over them from the three-point line his father had
spray-painted onto the concrete.</TE>
<TE>   "I would put the seven-footer in my face," he said, thus
explaining why the nation saw him shoot nothing but rainbows last
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   He would line them up and dribble around them, thus explaining why
he shoots so well off screens.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys can set some screens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, he and his younger brother Eric would turn on the lights and
turn on the gutted-out radio in the corner and play two-on-four until
after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Knightmare Alley, they called it.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, why just four?</TE>
<TE>   "If they need a fifth, I'll play," said his father, a retiree who
used to work in the health inspector's office.</TE>
<TE>   Knight used the dummies to help him earn a scholarship to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   He used them two seasons ago to overcome the stinging words of a
UCLA assistant who'd told him he would never play at this level.</TE>
<TE>   You've probably heard the story about how he immediately quit the
team for a day, but was talked into returning by a homeless person in
Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy asked me if I had done everything I could do to stay on
the team, and I had not," Knight said. "So I came back."</TE>
<TE>   When he did, the dummies were waiting for him, and had the good
sense to keep quiet.</TE>
<TE>   He used them to work his way into the starting lineup in the
middle of last year.</TE>
<TE>   After a splendid weekend in Pittsburgh, he's using them even now,
this week, Monday afternoon to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   He came home on the team's day off to work the dummies. You can
tell, because his practice jersey is still draped over the shopping
cart.</TE>
<TE>   Said Knight, "They still help me find my shot, get my rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Said his father, "People still don't believe it. But they work."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Knight also works.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to honing the sort of shooting that resulted in 21
points against Ole Miss and 12 important points against Cincinnati,
nobody works harder.</TE>
<TE>   Knight doesn't have the keys to Pauley Pavilion, but he knows who
does.</TE>
<TE>   He began borrowing them and using the gym at midnight last year,
initially with company.</TE>
<TE>   A janitor called the police and told them that a bum had broken
into the building and wouldn't stop shooting threes.</TE>
<TE>   When the cops recognized Knight, they considered the plight of the
inconsistent Bruins and told him to keep shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Thus empowered, he was in Pauley Pavilion shooting when Dec. 31
became Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be the first one in the gym in the new year," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He later took his father and brother to another shooting session
that lasted until 1:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why I don't have a girlfriend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sacrifices filled his mind last weekend as he danced downcourt
with an infectious smile that has come to represent this
irrepressible team.</TE>
<TE>   "I was smiling, just thinking about how much I've done, how far
I've come, all the obstacles," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   All four of them.</TE>

<HD>Snyder's Manner Is Hard to Top</HD>

<DL>COLUMBIA, Mo.</DL>
<LD>It always comes back to the hair. On the "Jim Rome Show," on ESPN's
"Pardon the Interruption," on local television and local radio, on
national television and national radio. Everybody wants to know.</LD>
<LD>   How does Missouri Coach Quin Snyder get that hair? It is thick. It
is smooth and wavy. It does this thing where the hair is swept back
with just the right little curl. It is so Clark Gable in a
21st-century kind of way.</LD>
<LD>   "I get tired of talking about the hair," Snyder says. "Really, I
don't spend that much time on it."</LD>
<TE>   That's the most upsetting thing. It's natural. Hair envy is an
ugly thing but anyone with bad hair understands.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not only the hair. There's Snyder envy period, the way
he's 35 and has this great job and everybody loves him.</TE>
<TE>   It's the way Snyder can charm a room. The room can be full of
adults or children, of basketball players or alumni or students. It
doesn't matter. Snyder can talk to whoever is in the room and make
those people feel as if he is speaking only to them. Snyder isn't
glib, it's not like that. He really talks to you. He says important
things. "Every day, if you listen to Coach Q, you learn something,"
says Travon Bryant, a Missouri sophomore from Long Beach. "You can
tell he's thought about what he's saying."</TE>
<TE>   And it's not only the way he can charm a room. It's the way Snyder
has learned to coach. It's just luck, some would say. It's just lucky
that this guy with the great hair and gift of gab who can make
everybody like him has fallen into this great job.</TE>
<TE>   But it hasn't been luck. Not in any way.</TE>
<TE>   Was it luck that earned Snyder a basketball scholarship to Duke?
Of course it was talent. While Snyder was a Duke guard, the Blue
Devils went to three Final Fours. Snyder is No. 3 on the Duke career
assist list.</TE>
<TE>   And while Snyder was playing for Mike Krzyzewski, he also was
learning from him and impressing the coach. So Snyder became an
assistant coach for Krzyzewski, but not before spending a year as an
assistant for Larry Brown and the Clippers. Not a bad apprenticeship.
The six years Snyder spent under Krzyzewski, those were pretty
productive too. He was instrumental in recruiting the Duke team that
finished 37-2 in 1998-99 and he helped coach them too.</TE>
<TE>   It was that record, and not the hair, it was that resume, and not
the sweet talk, that earned Snyder his first head-coaching job three
years ago at Missouri. It is his experience, under Brown and
Krzyzewski, that has shaped Snyder as a coach. He is a stickler for
details. He is proud to have introduced the computer and its
abilities to help scout, recruit, teach, organize, to Duke's program.</TE>
<TE>   He is proud to have played for and coached at Duke but he is not a
Krzyzewski clone and doesn't want to be called one. He bristles when
there is a hint someone considers him a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I know who I am," Snyder says. "I coached last year the way I
coached this year and I kind of smile when people ask if I've grown
into the job this year. What we've accomplished this year isn't about
whether I've arrived or I haven't arrived as a coach. [Kentucky
Coach] Tubby Smith once said something that stuck with me. Tubby said
that every year he hopes to grow as a coach and a person. That's what
I want to do. I want to grow every year. I want my players to grow, I
want the program to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Like UCLA, Missouri was a victim of high expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Based on an exciting, competitive performance against Duke in the
second round of the NCAA tournament last year, and because most of
the team came back, Missouri was in the top 10 of many preseason
polls.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Tigers started this season 9-0, they moved up to No.
2. The young coach knew better. He knew that Missouri wasn't the
second-best team in the country. "I told my players that, over and
over. But you know kids. They were on magazine covers. They were
everywhere. And then, when we fell to the point we weren't even
getting any votes in the poll, I told my kids we weren't that bad
either. We were better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Snyder talks about "the kids" a lot. He is not their friend but he
listens. He is not their father but he is a gentle teacher, a stern
taskmaster, a setter of limits, a man of high expectations. "You
don't want to let Coach Q down," Kareem Rush says. "He lets you know
he cares about you and he also lets you know he expects you to follow
the rules and learn lessons all year."</TE>
<TE>   So far Snyder is three for three in taking Missouri to the NCAA
tournament. In his rookie season, the Tigers lost in the first round
to North Carolina. Last year, it was a win over Georgia, then the
loss to Duke. This year there already have been upsets of Miami and
Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Coach Q," Bryant says, "is that because he was at
Duke, he brought some of those expectations with him. People expect
us to be Duke. We're not. We're still learning.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Q has been great about taking off the pressure. People said
bad things about us this year when we lost but Coach Q explained that
as long as we kept improving, things would be fine. He's all about
improving and doing things the right way. Coach Q might be young, but
he's tough. And that's a good thing for a coach. We need someone to
be tough."</TE>
<TE>   And about that hair? "Oh," Bryant says, "he loves the hair. Don't
let him fool you."</TE>

<HD>Girl Hit by Puck Dies</HD>
<DH>Hockey: 13-year-old was struck in head by deflected shot
while attending Columbus Blue Jacket game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 13-year old girl who was struck in the head by a puck during a
Columbus Blue Jacket game Saturday night died Monday night of her
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Brittanie Cecil was struck during the Blue Jackets' game against
the Calgary Flames at Nationwide Arena.</LD>
<LD>   "The Columbus Blue Jackets and Nationwide Arena are deeply
saddened by the tragic accident," Blue Jacket President and General
Manager Doug MacLean said in a statement. "Our thoughts, prayers and
condolences go out to Brittanie's family and friends during this time
of anguish. I can't imagine the grief her family is experiencing."</LD>
<TE>   The tragedy occurred during a season in which the NHL has pushed
team and arena officials to increase their warnings to fans in the
lower areas of arenas. Fans are not allowed to enter those areas
while games are in progress. Ushers at all NHL games carry red signs
with the words, "Stop: NHL puck policy."</TE>
<TE>   Cecil, who went to the game as a birthday present from her
father--she would have turned 14 today--was injured after a puck shot
by Blue Jacket center Espen Knutsen deflected off a defenseman's
stick and went over the protective glass. It struck another fan
before hitting Cecil, who is from Preble County, located in Ohio near
the Indiana border.</TE>
<TE>   She is believed to be the first fan to die after being struck by a
puck at an NHL game. Frank Brown, NHL spokesman, said Tuesday that he
could not recall another fan death resulting from being hit by a puck
at an NHL game. However, there have been tragic accidents at minor
league and amateur games.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, a 10-year old boy was killed after being struck by a puck
during an exhibition game between the Spokane Chiefs and Spokane
Eagles. A 21-year-old Canadian man died in March 2000, a week after
being struck by a puck that flew into the stands during a South
Eastern Manitoba Hockey League game between Altona and Carman. In
1979, a 9-year-old girl died after being hit in the forehead during
another game in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   One nonfatal accident in the NHL resulted in a lawsuit. Jonathan
Liebert was injured at the Great Western Forum when he was struck in
the head by a puck shot into the stands by San Jose Shark winger Joe
Murphy after the Kings had scored during a 1998 game. Liebert sued
Murphy, the Sharks and the Kings, claiming he had suffered memory
loss and damaged vision. He settled out of court for what was
believed to be $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Team and arena officials warn fans about the dangers of errant
pucks. As many as seven hardened rubber pucks reach the crowd during
an average game, some traveling at 100 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the public-address announcer tell the fans to be alert at
all times while the puck is in play, before the game and before every
period," King spokesman Mike Altieri said. "We have the same
announcement up on the video screen for 10 minutes during warmups."</TE>
<TE>   Altieri said the announcement is repeated during games in which
more pucks than usual reach the crowd. Fans are not allowed to enter
the seating area at Staples Center while play is in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want anyone's vision blocked while the game is going
on,"' Altieri said.</TE>
<TE>   Announcements are made twice during Mighty Duck games at the
Arrowhead Pond, reminding fans to stay alert. Event management
officials check on fans in areas where pucks land and Pond officials
have emergency medical units in the building.</TE>

<HD>L.A. or Germany? WTA Considers Move</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Vote scheduled for Friday on moving season-ending
tournament to Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A potentially close and controversial vote held in Florida?</LD>
<LD>   Well, why not? It has happened before.</LD>
<LD>   The WTA's board of directors will meet in Miami on Friday, voting
on the proposal to move its season-ending championships from Munich,
Germany, back to the United States, specifically, Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Wulff, the organization's new chief executive, has been
trying to make it happen for months. The game's leading players, such
as Monica Seles, favor it.</TE>
<TE>   There is a strong sentiment that the 28-year-old Seles, a beloved
figure in the game, should have the chance to finish her career
playing in the championships. Seles was stabbed in Hamburg, Germany
in 1993 by a deranged fan of Steffi Graf, and has emphatically said
she would not play in that country again.</TE>
<TE>   The USTA and one of its leaders, Arlen Kantarian, endorses a move
that would make the game stronger in this country. Octagon, the
management agency, was the co-promoter in Munich and would perform
the same role with Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, the sport has the opportunity to do something
that's right for the sport," Octagon President Phil de Picciotto
said. "There's a real collaboration around the move of this event.
We, Octagon, have the rights to this event, long-term. We have been
very energized by the prospect of this move.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing it as a collaborative effort around the best interest
of the tour, which is something tennis needs very badly."</TE>
<TE>   In the vast array of alphabet soup of professional tennis, there
apparently is one spot vacant on the bandwagon of consensus.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody shares it except one group," De Picciotto said.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Cleveland-based management group IMG, which has made
its displeasure known in a series of discussions with AEG. An IMG
spokesperson said Tuesday that it involved a rule issue "bigger than
IMG," but declined additional comment.</TE>
<TE>   The crux is a 125-mile protection against competing events, a rule
that has been flexible in the past. There are three other events
involving women in Southern California: Indian Wells in March,
Manhattan Beach in August, and La Costa, which is a week before
Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   One extreme example is in Japan. There are three tournaments in
Tokyo, one in February and two in September, separated by two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the season-ending championships have not been held
to that rule. For example, the tournament in Filderstadt, Germany,
falls within the 125-mile range of Munich and was held a few weeks
before the championships last year.</TE>
<TE>   IMG is a partner at Indian Wells, along with Charlie Pasarell and
his associates, and the company owns the Manhattan Beach event.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is an ideal marketplace for a women's-only indoor event
which complements all the other events in the region, rather than
affecting them," De Picciotto said.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament officials at Indian Wells agreed, downplaying the
potential impact. The format of the two events is different. Indian
Wells is held in a resort community and has large player fields, a
singles draw of 96 women and 64 men.</TE>
<TE>   So, on the surface, this dispute could appear to be two powerful
management agencies involved in a turf war, fighting over territory.
But one source said it involved other issues, not merely a battle
between two agencies.</TE>
<TE>   One of those issues is that the vote will represent an early
referendum on Wulff's regime. The former Nike executive took over in
January from Bart McGuire and received strong reviews for his
presentation at the players' meeting at the Australian Open in
January.</TE>
<TE>   There are 10 board members--six from the United States and four
from Europe--and a majority vote is required to pass the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The player class directors include two former top professional
stars, Harold Solomon and Kathy Jordan, and the third is Lisa
Grattan, who, incidentally, was one of the first to aid Seles when
she was stabbed in Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   Wulff is the CEO, and the two outside directors are Claude de
Jouvencel, chief executive of Grand Marnier, and Jan Soderstrom, once
senior vice president of marketing with Santa Clara-based 3Com.</TE>
<TE>   There are three tournament class directors: Adam Barrett,
executive vice president of the Miami tournament; Gunter Sanders, a
German tennis administrator, and Ivan Brixi, who represents Martina
Hingis at Octagon.</TE>
<TE>   The final director is Deborah Jevans, a former top British player,
who is executive director of the Fed Cup and women's tennis at the
International Tennis Federation (ITF).</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, much of the momentum behind a potential move has
been fueled by the players.</TE>
<TE>   When the tour decided to move the championships to Germany, Seles
was deeply disappointed. When discussions of moving the tournament to
Staples Center emerged at Indian Wells last week, Seles became
encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love it," she said. "I love this part of California. For
me, anywhere in the U.S., I would be ecstatic because it would give
me the chance to finish my career playing in the championships, which
is obviously the key.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many players from the U.S. who are the best and this
is where the future of the game is and they could showcase it the
best. I hope."</TE>
<TE>   Seles spoke to some players who competed in the event last year.</TE>
<TE>   "They mentioned the atmosphere wasn't the same," she said. "It
felt a little bit anticlimactic. We got so spoiled playing in Madison
Square Garden."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the Munich event was hurt in the aftermath of Sept.
11. Also, Venus Williams withdrew because of an injured wrist. Hingis
also was sidelined by a torn ankle ligament.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis, who lives in Switzerland and Florida, was willing to go
along with what was best for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever benefits women's tennis," she said. "I loved it when it
was in the Garden. Munich was very close to my home, so I kind of
like that. But the attendance wasn't as great as expected. If you
don't have any top German players, it's difficult in Germany."</TE>
<TE>   She chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, there is a direct flight from Zurich to L.A., so I'll
be ready for it," Hingis said.</TE>
<TE>   Seles doesn't buy the argument that a major event at Staples could
have an impact on the two summer outdoor tournaments at Manhattan
Beach and La Costa, or even Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," she said. "It might take a year or two to
build it up so people get used to it. Then the timing is so
different. Also, it's a different format. Here, you are playing the
top players."</TE>

<HD>Suit Alleges Bias at Cal State Fullerton</HD>
<DH>Courts: Six current or former workers say they faced
discrimination because they're Latino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six current or former Cal State Fullerton employees sued the
university this week, saying they had been discriminated against
because of their Latino ethnicity.</LD>
<LD>   Two associate deans with doctorates, three clerks and a student
assistant are plaintiffs.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged discrimination includes demotions, unfair discipline,
lack of promotions, poor evaluations, harassment and a firing.</LD>
<TE>   The suit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court is the
latest against the university. In recent years Cal State Fullerton
has settled or lost three sexual harassment lawsuits, and a related
suit is pending.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs in the latest case worked in the student affairs
division, which since 1997 has been overseen by Robert Palmer, vice
president of student affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ever make a complaint under Palmer's regime, you get
retaliated against," said Keith Walden, the plaintiffs' attorney.
"I'm quite convinced that discrimination is occurring, and it's
occurring because they're Hispanic. These people are in all different
kinds of jobs in all different [levels]. One thing in common is that
they're Hispanic."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State University system lawyers would not comment, saying they
had not seen the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer denied there was discrimination. "I'm proud of the
diversity within the division," he said. "That lawsuit has no basis
in my opinion."</TE>
<TE>   No individuals are named as defendants, and the suit does not ask
for a specific dollar figure.</TE>
<TE>   The two associate deans have left Cal State Fullerton but found
jobs elsewhere, Walden said. According to the suit, Michael Suarez
was fired in February 2001 after working at Fullerton for 16 months.
He now works at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Chavez was associate dean of student life for about 3 1/2
years. According to the suit, she left Fullerton because of
discrimination. Her problems worsened after she told administrators
that Suarez was fired because he was Latino, according to the suit.
She now works at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting better jobs, with more responsibilities," Walden
said. "These are quality people, but they're being maligned as
incompetent or ineffective in their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Rodriguez, a graduate student who works as a student assistant
in admissions and records, says in the suit that he was demoted
because he complained to the university about discrimination and
other problems and provided information to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   A university investigation found Rodriguez's reassignment was not
a demotion.</TE>
<TE>   It also found that Chuck Moore, supervisor of the Enrollment
Management and University Outreach unit, "did make comments that were
perceived to be anti-Latino but these comments are not indicative of
his actual hiring record."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says the investigation was a whitewash.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Allege Discrimination by University</HD>
<DH>Courts: In the latest action against Cal State Fullerton,
six current or former employees say their ethnicity led to unfair
treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six current or former Cal State Fullerton employees sued the
university this week, saying they had been discriminated against
because of their Latino ethnicity.</LD>
<LD>   Two associate deans with doctorates, three clerks and a student
assistant are plaintiffs.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged discrimination includes demotions, unfair discipline,
lack of promotions, poor evaluations, harassment and a firing.</LD>
<TE>   The suit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court is the
latest against the university. In recent years Cal State Fullerton
has settled or lost three sexual harassment lawsuits, and a related
suit is pending.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs in the latest case worked in the student affairs
division, which since 1997 has been overseen by Robert Palmer, vice
president of student affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ever make a complaint under Palmer's regime, you get
retaliated against," said Keith Walden, the plaintiffs' attorney.
"I'm quite convinced that discrimination is occurring, and it's
occurring because they're Hispanic. These people are in all different
kinds of jobs in all different [levels]. One thing in common is that
they're Hispanic."</TE>
<TE>   California State University system lawyers would not comment,
saying they had not seen the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer denied there was discrimination. "I'm proud of the
diversity within the division," he said. "That lawsuit has no basis
in my opinion."</TE>
<TE>   No individuals are named as defendants, and the suit does not ask
for a specific dollar figure.</TE>
<TE>   The two associate deans have left Cal State Fullerton but found
jobs elsewhere, Walden said. According to the suit, Michael Suarez
was fired in February 2001 after working at Fullerton for 16 months.
He now works at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Chavez was associate dean of student life for about 3 1/2
years. According to the suit, she left Fullerton because of
discrimination. Her problems worsened after she told administrators
that Suarez was fired because he was Latino, according to the suit.
She now works at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting better jobs, with more responsibilities and
working for institutions at least as prominent as Cal State
Fullerton," Walden said. "These are quality people, but they're being
maligned as incompetent or ineffective in their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Rodriguez, a graduate student who works as a student assistant
in admissions and records, says in the suit that he was demoted
because he complained to the university about discrimination and
other problems and provided information to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   A university investigation found Rodriguez's reassignment was not
a demotion.</TE>
<TE>   It also found that Chuck Moore, the supervisor of the Enrollment
Management and University Outreach unit, "did make comments that were
perceived to be anti-Latino but these comments are not indicative of
his actual hiring record."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says the investigation was a whitewash.</TE>
<TE>   Another plaintiff's claims arise out of her role in using
university funds to pay for wedding and baby showers in late 2000. A
university investigation found that about $800 spent on the showers
was "deliberately misrepresented" as spent on training sessions so
Fullerton would pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   The highest-ranking employee involved, Linda Cambron, was given a
substantial raise six days before she began a three-day suspension
without pay for her role, and was promoted into a management
position.</TE>
<TE>   Two lower-ranked employees received 30-day suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   School officials have said Cambron was not promoted, but that her
job was reclassified to reflect duties she already was performing.</TE>
<TE>   According to her lawyers and the suit, plaintiff Vina Barcelo, a
clerk under Cambron, was docked about $3,400 as a result of her
suspension and had her job responsibilities limited.</TE>
<TE>   "Defendants' decision to issue a harsher penalty against Barcelo
was motivated by Plaintiff's race as a Hispanic woman," the suit
says.</TE>
<TE>   The showers are among several incidents that have plagued Cal
State Fullerton in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the university paid nearly $500,000 to settle a sexual
harassment lawsuit brought by longtime employee Pamela Losco, a
figure that may be the largest of its kind paid by the California
State University system. Her assistant also sued for sexual
harassment and settled for $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, an assistant biology professor and her attorney were
awarded $311,000 last year after her sexual harassment case went to
the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Losco's brother, former Cal State Fullerton personnel director
David Losco, also has filed suit against the university, saying he
was demoted for helping his sister. He also says the administration
retaliated against him for providing information alleging financial
mismanagement to the state auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Another lawsuit, filed last year by Kenneth Nash, a psychological
counselor at Fullerton for about 25 years, charges discrimination,
harassment and retaliation.</TE>

<HD>Section 8 Renters May Get Help From City</HD>
<DH>Housing: With landlords bailing out of federal voucher
program, measures to provide protection to recipients are considered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to an alarming shortage of affordable housing, the Los
Angeles City Council and the city's Rent Adjustment Commission are
considering urgent measures designed to ensure that landlords rent to
thousands of tenants with federal housing vouchers.</LD>
<LD>   The measures, backed by housing advocates and tenant groups, take
aim at the growing number of landlords who have opted to cease
renting to tenants who use so-called Section 8 housing vouchers.</LD>
<LD>   The trend has forced many tenants out of their homes and made it
impossible for others to find housing. Currently, 59% of those with
vouchers are unable to find housing within the time and rent
limitations, rendering their federal assistance useless.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year we lost 6,000 Section 8 contracts, mainly because
landlords can get more money on the open market," said Rod Field, an
attorney with the Los Angeles Housing Law Project.</TE>
<TE>   Field is part of a coalition that has asked the City Council to
back an amendment to the city's rent stabilization law that would
make it illegal to evict tenants from rent-controlled buildings
because they are paying with the federal vouchers. The council is
expected to vote on the matter today.</TE>
<TE>   Local authorities have also negotiated an increase in the
allowable maximum rents under Section 8. That hike could amount to
nearly $100 on a two-bedroom apartment--if it is approved by the Rent
Adjustment Commission--and would probably increase landlords'
willingness to rent to subsidized tenants.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment, which has already received initial approval from
city lawmakers, is opposed by the Apartment Owners Assn. of Greater
Los Angeles. The group's leaders say it is "unconstitutional and
misguided" to force landlords to accept Section 8 tenants, whose
vouchers can amount to hundreds of dollars less than market rents.</TE>
<TE>   "We will, of course, approach Mayor [James K.] Hahn for a veto,"
said Charles Isham, executive vice president of the association.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment declares that changes are "urgently required for the
immediate preservation of the public health and safety." The
declaration means the law would take effect immediately--offering
protection to tenants who currently have no recourse when a landlord
decides to opt out of the subsidy program.</TE>
<TE>   Without the amendment, Elizabeth Cooper of North Hills faces the
prospect of losing the apartment she has shared for nearly 12 years
with her developmentally disabled and wheelchair-bound son.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just hoping and praying that the City Council will find it in
their hearts to sign this and sign it with urgency," said Cooper, who
received a 90-day notice from the new owner of her apartment. "It
will give some kind of protection to tenants who face this and who
face the fear of not knowing what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma facing Section 8 tenants is an outgrowth of the city's
tight housing market, high rents and changes in federal guidelines.
The changes have made it easier for landlords to terminate contracts
with the Los Angeles Housing Authority and fetch higher rents on the
open market, housing advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   Some landlords argue that the exodus is also fueled by the
program's burdensome bureaucracy and inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "Many small apartment owners throw their hands up in despair and
say, 'I don't need it,'" Isham said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the cause, landlords are fleeing the program. In a
typical scenario, Section 8 tenants are told the owner will no longer
accept vouchers and that the tenants are responsible for the full
rent.</TE>
<TE>   The average income of a Section 8 tenant is $12,000 a year. More
than 46% of these tenants are either elderly or disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect is that the rent will become out of reach for the
tenants," said Mary Maher, an assistant director of the city's
Section 8 program. "Normally they can pay their share under Section
8, but they can't afford the full rent. They end up probably getting
evicted for failure to pay rent."</TE>
<TE>   Forced back into the housing market, the ousted Section 8 tenants
find few units available. The phenomenon has meant an upsurge in
calls to assistance programs such as Neighborhood Legal Services of
Los Angeles County in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had hundreds of clients," said Chancela Al-Mansour of
Neighborhood Legal Services. "Last year alone, I had three buildings
of more than 25 people who, at the same time, received 30- or 90-day
eviction notices saying the owner was terminating all Section 8
contracts."</TE>
<TE>   Housing officials and advocates argue that Section 8 tenants
deserve the same protections as tenants of rent-controlled
buildings--those covered under the city's Rent Stabilization
Ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   The law covers buildings built before 1978. It also clearly
defines the reasons for which tenants can be evicted. The amendment
to be considered today would add language to the ordinance making it
illegal to reject Section 8 tenants from rent-controlled buildings
merely because they pay with federal vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, some Section 8 tenants have faced formal eviction
notices while others have simply been told their vouchers would no
longer be accepted. Neither practice would be legal under the
amendment.</TE>
<TE>   But landlords complain that the proposed change would effectively
force them into an "endless lease." Landlords fear that, if they fail
to accept the vouchers, they would still be required to house the
Section 8 tenants and accept the small portion of the rent they are
required to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Such a scenario, Isham said, would amount to the government taking
landlords' income.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be another disincentive to go into the Section 8
program," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Apartment Owners Assn. board has not decided if it will sue.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure is being applauded by tenants across the region
who have organized in protest over the massive loss of housing caused
by landlord defections from the program.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Bernard, president of the Lincoln Place Tenants Assn.,
helped encourage Section 8 tenants of her Venice complex to file a
lawsuit accusing the owner of discrimination. The landlord denied the
allegations and the suit was settled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're glad these thousands of evictions will no longer be
permitted, because many of these evictions involved frail seniors and
also families with children," Bernard said. "It's a real injustice."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, officials are hoping to make the voucher program
more attractive to landlords by increasing rents.</TE>
<TE>   The Housing Authority has asked the city's Rent Adjustment
Commission for permission to raise the rents of existing Section 8
tenants higher than the 3% increase allowed under the rent
stabilization ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   For example, an apartment currently renting for $800 could
increase to $824 under the rent stabilization ordinance. But if the
Rent Adjustment Commission approves the proposed change, rent on the
same apartment could increase to as much as $920, if justified by
neighborhood and market conditions, Maher said.</TE>
<TE>   The additional rent would be covered by increased federal
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   With that increase, already approved by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, some owners of rent-controlled buildings would
actually receive higher rents from Section 8 tenants than they would
be permitted to charge other renters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously looking to protect our tenants," said Maher, the
city's Section 8 representative. "But we're also looking to make sure
Section 8 is a good deal for landlords."</TE>
<TE>   The Rent Adjustment Commission is scheduled to take up the issue
at its April 4 meeting.</TE>

<HD>Housing for Farm Workers Under Review</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Supervisors say more affordable shelter is
needed to protect the county's $1-billion industry as well as open
space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More farm worker housing is needed if Ventura County is to achieve
the twin goals of preserving open space and keeping its agricultural
industry vibrant, county supervisors said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Providing shelter for the laborers who pick strawberries, pack
lemons and harvest lettuce should be a top priority in Ventura
County--as important as guarding against environmental blight, board
Chairman John Flynn said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have people who can't find a place to live," Flynn said. "They
are living in garages, and that is a violation of my moral code."</LD>
<TE>   The comments come as supervisors await the results of a survey
asking farm workers to assess their living conditions. About 1,500
workers have filled out questionnaires in recent months, said Senior
County Planner Kelly Scoles.</TE>
<TE>   County planners are tabulating the responses and will present a
report to the supervisors this summer, Scoles said. The information
is expected to guide the officials as they consider new policies on
beefing up the county's affordable-housing stock.</TE>
<TE>   The county gained prominence for its growth-control efforts after
voters in 1998 approved tight restrictions on development of cropland
and open space. Now, decision-makers are struggling to mesh
residents' desires to retain a semi-rural feel in Ventura County with
farmers' need for regulations flexible enough to keep their fields
profitable.</TE>
<TE>   In a spirited, three-hour debate before a joint session of county
supervisors and planning commissioners last week, dozens of
residents, farmers and government officials considered how to do
that.</TE>
<TE>   No one is sure how to reach a compromise. But decisions on such
things as farm worker housing will begin to address the question,
officials said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long suggested that the county find out more
about a recently approved voter initiative in Napa County that
loosens zoning restrictions so growers can build shelter for their
laborers.</TE>
<TE>   Lemon grower Tom Pecht, whose family has been farming the Oxnard
Plain for a century, said he supports any movement to help solve the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants two or three families living in a house," Pecht
said. "They should have their own homes."</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of how many farm workers live in Ventura County vary
wildly, from 15,000 to 34,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County does not have the large migrant laborer population
seen in Napa, Pecht said. Local workers tend to stay year-round and
crowd into garages and apartments instead of bunkhouses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the two counties have one thing in common: Workers will not be
available if there is not adequate shelter, said Pecht, a member of
the county's Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee. And that's a
threat to the county's $1-billion industry, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have agricultural workers, you don't have ag," Pecht
said. "It's as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of growth restrictions say they recognize the need to
make concessions. Supervisor Steve Bennett, who helped write the
county's SOAR growth-control initiatives, said allowances for housing
should be considered.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as it's in the spirit of keeping ag viable, I would be in
support," Bennett said. "But you don't want a loophole large enough
to drive a subdivision through it."</TE>

<HD>Board Withdraws Adult Literacy Contract</HD>
<DH>Schools: Firm had been pushed by Sen. Polanco. L.A.
district members say they were misled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Board of Education on Tuesday voted to withdraw from
a controversial $6.3-million adult literacy program that had been
advocated by state Senate Majority Leader Richard Polanco.</LD>
<LD>   The reversal came after school board members learned that the
program was not the one they thought they had approved, that its
Internet lessons for immigrants were not yet developed and that it
was located in the law office of a close friend of Polanco, J.
Arnaldo Beltran.</LD>
<LD>   Board member Genethia Hayes, who originally proposed that the
district adopt the program a week ago, made the motion to quash the
spending Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   She said she had thought last week that the district was hiring a
Redmond, Wash., firm she visited, not the spinoff represented by
Beltran.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a different company and a different product that I saw
when I went to Washington," Hayes said. "This is a new company and a
product I haven't seen."</TE>
<TE>   The program passed 4 to 3 last week, but only one vote switch was
needed to kill it, and that was provided by Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting Tuesday, the rest of the board said they
supported her action.</TE>
<TE>   The three other board members who voted to hire Reality Based
Learning--Jose Huizar, Julie Korenstein and David Tokofsky--also
expressed regret that they had originally approved the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we were misled," Huizar said. "We've learned from this
mistake that we have to do a thorough analysis of the companies that
we deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer, angered by what he saw as Polanco's inappropriate
interference with school board issues, strongly opposed the program
and urged that it be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Romer has said that Polanco misled the board by not divulging that
there are actually two Reality Based Learning companies--one based in
Washington state, the other in Los Angeles. The Washington company
has 30 employees and child literacy software being used by 40,000
schoolchildren in Seattle and Canada. The Los Angeles-based firm has
three employees, no finished product and until Tuesday had only one
customer--L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, reached at another meeting in Los Angeles on Tuesday,
declined to comment about the school board action or his role in
lobbying for the firm. He previously denied any wrongdoing and said
he was only advocating for his many English-learning constituents. He
said that he knew there were two separate companies and that he had
no intention of misleading anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies were founded by Gary Andersen, but he has left the
Washington firm and has been running the California company since
October.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran was listed as the registered agent of Reality Based
Learning California, but in a phone interview Tuesday, he said he has
severed his ties with the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The board's original vote for the program came despite warnings
from a district lawyer who said that Polanco's "serial meetings" with
individual school trustees violated California's public meeting law.</TE>
<TE>   During last week's heated exchange with Romer at the school board
meeting, Polanco detailed how he had lobbied board members for a year
to persuade them to adopt the Reality Based Learning program.</TE>
<TE>   That admission kicked off an investigation by the district
inspector general into possible violations of the state's public
meeting laws.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco said he has not violated any such laws.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said that Polanco is being unfairly targeted by the
criticism and blamed Andersen for not telling her that he had spun
off an entirely new company. Hayes said she also blamed herself for
not being more wary of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said Tuesday that he had told Hayes about the new
endeavor and said he was disappointed that his literacy program
"seemed destined for failure."</TE>
<TE>   Board members and district staff who had opposed the plan all
along said they felt vindicated by Tuesday's reversal and still
seemed stunned by the bravado Polanco displayed a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that Sen. Polanco was very heavy-handed," said board
member Marlene Canter, who voted against the measure last week. "I
was disappointed that we voted against the superintendent when he had
done a very thorough review and had sent staff to look at that
program.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a political embarrassment to me that he [Polanco] would
come here and speak to us, to our superintendent, in that manner."</TE>
<TE>   Huizar said that the episode might have a happy ending, however,
if the board pays more attention to the issues raised by Reality
Based Learning.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything good comes out of this, it is that we're talking
about addressing adult literacy problems."</TE>

<HD>The Big One in L.A. Basin May Have Been an Orange County
Event</HD>

<LD>A recently discovered fault may have been responsible for the largest
recorded earthquake in the Los Angeles Basin--a seismic event more
than 200 years ago so cataclysmic that it raised the ground by as
much as 11 feet.</LD>
<LD>   That is the premise of a UC Irvine professor's study to be
published next month in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of
America, one of the premier journals of earthquake science.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a fairly large earthquake," said Lisa Grant, an assistant
professor of geology, whose study links the Portola earthquake of
1769 to the San Joaquin Hills fault in South Orange County. "What I
find the most interesting and important about this is that it shows
the fault to be active."</LD>
<TE>   Some scientists argue that the newly found fault is a slow-moving
one unlikely to generate a major earthquake more often than, say,
every 2,500 years.</TE>
<TE>   "What's been demonstrated is that there has been a very recent
large uplift event," said Tom Rockwell, a professor of geology at San
Diego State University and leader of the geology group at the
Southern California Earthquake Center. "One consequence is that a
repeat of this earthquake is not likely to occur very soon--not in
the next few decades, probably not for at least several hundred
years."</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 study by Grant first drew attention to the fault, which
stretches about 25 miles from Newport Bay to Dana Point along the
coast and inland as far as the San Diego Freeway. Previously the only
major fault known in Orange County was the Newport-Inglewood fault,
which runs parallel to the coast and generated the deadly 1933 Long
Beach earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists remain skeptical that the San Joaquin Hills fault
exists, said Chris Wells, senior engineering geologist for the
California Geological Survey. But there is enough evidence that his
agency has recommended its inclusion on an upcoming revision of the
national seismic hazard map.</TE>
<TE>   "There is consensus that it is a structure we need to consider,"
Wells said. "If it were in a desert it wouldn't be significant, but
it is important because of where it is." The general area includes
heavily populated areas of Costa Mesa, Irvine and Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest study, Grant and several assistants relied, among
other things, on diaries kept by members of the historic Gaspar de
Portola expedition, a group of Spanish explorers who camped by the
Santa Ana River in what is now north Orange County. Their accounts
describe a "severe" earthquake on July 28, 1769, followed by
aftershocks over the next several days, each measured by the number
of Hail Marys the explorers could utter during each tremor.</TE>
<TE>   Grant concludes that the earthquake chronicled by Portola's men
probably happened along the San Joaquin Hills fault and may have had
a magnitude of 7.3, considerably larger than the 6.7-magnitude
Northridge earthquake of 1994 that killed 61 people and caused $40
billion in damage.</TE>

<HD>Search Ends With Arrest of Wife</HD>
<DH>Crime: Suspect poisoned her husband, then buried his body
and fled to Florida, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of a Sacramento lawyer poisoned him, refrigerated and later
buried his body in a shallow grave, then led police on a nationwide
manhunt in a red Jaguar convertible, her 17-year-old daughter in tow,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The search ended Tuesday as authorities in Florida announced the
arrest of Laren Renee Sims, 36, in connection with the murder of her
husband, attorney Larry McNabney, whose body was discovered buried in
a San Joaquin County vineyard last month.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm the one you are looking for," Sims told a sheriff's deputy in
Destin, Fla., a beach resort, as the officer approached her late
Monday night.</LD>
<TE>   San Joaquin County authorities charge that Sims, who also has used
the name Elisa McNabney, and an accomplice poisoned Larry McNabney
with horse tranquilizers last September and stored his body, wrapped
in sheeting, in a garage refrigerator for months until Sims buried
him. Sims sold off McNabney's office assets, horses and a truck,
closed the law practice and disappeared in January, eluding
authorities by using fake names and pilfered credit cards, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sims' daughter, Haylie Jordan, is not believed to have been
involved, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   San Joaquin County sheriff's officials said Tuesday that Sims had
signed a three-page statement admitting her role in the murder and
implicating Sarah Elizabeth Dutra, 21, who had worked in McNabney's
law office and befriended Sims. Dutra, who earlier offered what San
Joaquin County officials characterized as inconsistent statements,
was arrested after questioning Tuesday at the sheriff's headquarters
in French Camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Once Elisa McNabney implicated [Dutra], we brought her in and
she's made some pretty incriminating statements regarding her
involvement," said Deputy Nelida Stone, a sheriff's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Sims statement, Dutra took part in the poisoning
and then helped transport McNabney, still semiconscious, to Yosemite
National Park, where the two planned to bury him, police said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sims could not go through with the burial while her husband
was still alive, and the two women took him home, where he died the
following day, authorities said, citing the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said Sims did not offer a motive.</TE>
<TE>   San Joaquin County investigators were in Florida on Tuesday
awaiting word on whether Sims would waive her right to an extradition
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Sims was to be arraigned today in Okaloosa County.</TE>
<TE>   Florida investigators said they believe that Sims, using the alias
Shane Ivaroni, had been living since late January in Florida's
panhandle, where she was working two jobs, as a paralegal and as a
waitress in a chophouse.</TE>
<TE>   At the time she was arrested by Okaloosa County sheriff's deputies
on the murder warrant from California, Sims also was wanted by three
Florida counties for violating probation, said Cpl. Rick Hord,
spokesman for the Okaloosa County sheriff's office. Hord said Sims
has a long criminal history.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, she's a con artist, for lack of a better word," he
said. "She's apparently made a career by changing names, changing
appearances, fooling people along the way."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Hord said, it was an act of deception that helped
deputies track Sims down.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, she took off with an acquaintance's pickup truck after
staying at his home for the night, leaving a hurried farewell note
and her Jaguar behind, Hord said. The Dodge pickup turned up
abandoned Monday night in the parking lot of a Winn-Dixie
supermarket. Not far away, Sims, wearing the same blue jeans and red
jacket that police had been looking for, was intercepted as she
ambled from the beach into the swimming pool area of a condominium
high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   "She gave no resistance whatsoever. She had just gotten tired of
running. Her days of being able to run were over," Hord said.</TE>
<TE>   Hord said Sims' daughter was staying with relatives. He said
Okaloosa deputies found the girl, who was using the name Penelope
Ivaroni, in one of the residences where it was thought Sims might
turn up. The daughter told police where to find the pickup.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not appear that she knew of the severe details" of the
California allegations, Hord said.</TE>
<TE>   At Destin Chops, where Sims--calling herself Shane Ivaroni--waited
tables until about a week and a half ago, employees were taken aback
by the news.</TE>
<TE>   "She seemed like a great person to everyone," said the manager,
who declined to provide his name during a brief telephone interview.
"It's a little bit of a nauseous feeling for some of us."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brand Keeps Proving Prowess on Boards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As far as the Clippers are concerned, the ball continues to fall into
the right hands. Forward Elton Brand's stranglehold on the title of
the NBA's leading offensive rebounder is nearing the end of its third
season and there's no sign of it loosening.</LD>
<LD>   "When I led it with the Bulls, I used to think it was because we
missed so many shots," Brand joked after Tuesday's practice.</LD>
<LD>   Now that he's a Clipper, he has hardly missed a beat, leading the
league with 319 offensive rebounds in 66 games for an average of 4.8.
Six of his team-leading 12 rebounds were on the offensive end during
the Clippers' victory Monday over the Houston Rockets.</LD>
<TE>   Brand is nearing Michael Cage's franchise record of 371, set in
1987-88. What's more, over the last three seasons, Brand has 952
offensive rebounds, more than 100 more than his nearest challenger,
Philadelphia's Dikembe Mutombo. Brand stands 6 feet 8 and Mutombo is
7-2.</TE>
<TE>   How does he do it?</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely, it's determination," Brand said. "Definitely, it's
long arms. It's also outwitting the other players and being where the
ball is going to be. I like going after offensive boards. It doesn't
just give me an extra opportunity to shoot, but our team. Sometimes
you can take the heart out of the other team with an offensive
rebound."</TE>
<TE>   Brand shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just happened," he said of leading the league for the last
three seasons, "and it's just happening."</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Jeff McInnis and reserve forward Darius Miles did not
practice Tuesday because of bumps and bruises. Backup forward Quentin
Richardson limped around on a sore left thigh.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have been without forwards Corey Maggette and Lamar
Odom and guard Keyon Dooling for almost a month. There's a chance
Maggette soon will be recovered from a hand injury and arthroscopic
knee surgery. But Odom (wrist and ankle) and Dooling (ankle) could be
sidelined for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just beat up right now," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "It's too
bad. We probably need to be at our healthiest right now, but we're
probably as beat up as we have been the whole year."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have held the opposition to less than 100 points in
11 consecutive games. They last gave up 100 or more in a 106-88 loss
Feb. 23 against the Pacers at Indianapolis.... If Gentry's prediction
that it will take at least 45 victories to advance to the playoffs in
the West is accurate, then the Clippers (35-33) must win 10 of their
final 14 games. The Clippers last won 45 games in 1991-92.</TE>

<HD>Kariya, Ducks in Rare Form</HD>
<DH>Hockey: His second goal, with 1:04 left in the game, beats
NHL-leading Red Wings, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Paul Kariya knows there aren't many opportunities to score on the
Detroit Red Wings, so he took advantage of the few he had.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya had two goals, including the game-winner with 1:04 left, as
the Mighty Ducks beat the Red Wings, 2-1, Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "There's never a lot of chances against them," Kariya said. "In
every game, I get one or two great chances. I was lucky enough to get
them both tonight."</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks beat the Red Wings for the first time in exactly two
years and won in Joe Louis Arena for the first time since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   On the winning goal, Kariya skated to a corner to corral a dumped
puck, passed it to Jeff Friesen, who quickly got the puck back to
Kariya for his 29th goal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just one of those, get it on your stick and shoot," Kariya
said.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which has the best record in the NHL, had won 10 of 12
games. The Ducks are ahead of only Columbus in the Western Conference
and have more points than just three teams.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Shields made 28 saves--including several key stops in the
third period--for the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "Shields was great," said Duck Coach Bryan Murray, who coached the
Red Wings for three seasons before Scotty Bowman was hired in 1993.
"And Kariya was really good. He had two chances and he took advantage
of both."</TE>
<TE>   Dominik Hasek made 23 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't compete for two periods," Hasek said. "Then we tried to
come back. The way we competed tonight is not the way we need to
compete in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit will compete in the playoffs with essentially the same
team that has dominated the league, after deciding against making a
big move by Tuesday's trade deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings acquired defenseman Jiri Slegr from the Atlanta
Thrashers for minor leaguer Yuri Butsayev and a 2002 third-round
pick.</TE>
<TE>   With 3.1 seconds left in the second, Kariya's slap shot from the
left circle on a breakaway went over Hasek's shoulder to give the
Ducks a 1-0 lead.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The third Corona del Mar High National Invitational Tournament will
include boys' tennis teams from across the country--and one from
outside of it--in competition Friday and Saturday at sites in Newport
Beach and Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Among the 16-team field are top-seeded Irvine University, the
defending Southern Section Division II champion; second-seeded St.
Joseph's College of Brisbane, Australia; third-seeded Corona del Mar,
the defending Division V champion, and fourth-seeded Atherton Menlo,
the Northern California representative.</LD>
<LD>   The only other participant from the Times' top 10 rankings is
fifth-ranked North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, and the only other
Southern Section team is San Marino, a replacement for Christ Church
High of Greensville, S.C.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously I want out-of-state teams to be there because it's a
national tournament," said Corona del Mar Coach Tim Mang, the
tournament's director. "I'd like to have the four best teams in
Southern California, but we also want teams from out of the area, and
there's only 16 teams."</TE>
<TE>   The other participating teams from California are Fresno Clovis
West, Auburn Placer, Carmichael Jesuit, Millbrae Mills, Sacramento
Rio Americano, Cupertino Monta Vista and Moraga Campolindo. From out
of state are Horace Mann of Riverdale, N.Y.; Brophy College Prep of
Phoenix, and Cheshire Academy of Cheshire, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Play starts at 10:30 a.m. Friday with eight-game, pro-set matches
at Corona del Mar High, Palisades Tennis Club, Newport Beach Tennis
Club, Balboa Bay Racquet Club and Park Newport Apartments in Newport
Beach and the Costa Mesa Tennis Center.</TE>
<TE>   Semifinals will be at 1 p.m. Saturday at Palisades, with finals at
5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Regular-season roll: When it comes to powerhouse programs,
Rosemead Bosco Tech's doesn't spring to mind the way those do at such
tennis-rich schools as Corona del Mar, Palos Verdes Peninsula,
Beverly Hills and Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the school's success in the sport is relatively
new.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers (11-0, 1-0 in Santa Fe League play) are 51-0 in
regular-season matches since juniors Howard Nguyen, Marco Pineda and
James Olivares arrived in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just getting things rolling," Coach John Sepulveda said.
"We happened to get some kids who were not bad players."</TE>
<TE>   This season, Nguyen, the team's top player, has played only one
match while focusing on schoolwork. He is 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Pineda is 29-1 and Olivares is 32-1, with each losing only to Los
Angeles Murphy's Ken Brown, the league's singles champion the last
two seasons, in Bosco Tech's 15-3 victory in a league opener
Thursday.</TE>

<LD>A look at the top 10 boys' tennis teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Irvine University (4-1, SS-Div. II)</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Yovan &amp; Co. should get some competition in the All-American
tournament this weekend. (No. 1 last week)</LD>
<TE>   2. Corona del Mar (7-0, SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Junior Garrett Snyder is 16-2 in sets, losing only to Troy's
Jeffrey Das and Peninsula's Garrett Leight. (2)</TE>
<TE>   3. Troy (10-1, SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Das is 30-0, and freshmen Larry Wang (22-5), Jeffrey Hsu

<TE>   4. Los Alamitos (1-2, SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   The Griffins were off last week, but the rest didn't seem to help
in a 10-8 loss to Brentwood on Monday. (3)</TE>
<TE>   5. Harvard-Westlake (5-0, SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Senior Jon Rubenstein played well in victories over St. Francis

Servite and Peninsula on games. (6)</TE>
<TE>   7. Westlake (6-0, SS-Div. III)</TE>
<TE>   Warriors have won 30 consecutive Marmonte matches but should
toughen schedule. (7)</TE>
<TE>   8. Hoover (7-0, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Singles play is more heralded, but Eddie Choi, Joseph Kim and rest
of lineup have done the job in doubles too. (9)</TE>
<TE>   9. Servite (6-1, SS-Div. IV)</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Buchanan made difference as Friars rolled past Esperanza,
Mater Dei and Anaheim Canyon. (10)</TE>
<TE>   10. Esperanza (8-1, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Manson and Vince Gonzales (22-2) have come far playing

<HD>Pick Six Pool Will Overflow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another Wednesday at Santa Anita, another pick six carry-over.</LD>
<LD>   It is becoming almost routine that nobody isolates the final six
winners of the afternoon on Sunday's card, giving bettors two days to
put together a bankroll to attack the pick six on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   More than $193,000 is waiting in the pot and the pool could swell
to close to $1 million before the sequence starts with the third
race, a $10,000 claimer for older fillies and mares.</LD>
<TE>   Those who prefer sprints to routes will enjoy today's program. Six
of the eight races are seven furlongs or less and five of the six in
the pick six are around one turn.</TE>
<TE>   The only two-turn race in the sequence is the fourth, a miler for
$12,500 claimers. Yankee Pirate, already a two-time winner at the
meet for trainer Bill Spawr, is the probable favorite under Laffit
Pincay Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The pick six is completed by a six-furlong dash for 3-year-old
fillies running for a $40,000 claiming price, a 61/2-furlong race for
$25,000 maiden claimers, a seven-furlong allowance for older
California-breds and a seven-furlong event for 3-year-old maiden
fillies competing for a $40,000 tag.</TE>
<TE>   The day also brings the first 2-year-old race of 2002. A full
field of 10 California-bred fillies will run a quarter of a mile.
Among the new sires represented are Swiss Yodeler, a prolific
2-year-old who won the Hollywood Futurity a few years back, and
Souvenir Copy, who won the Del Mar Futurity for trainer Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Party Queen, a promising 3-year-old daughter of
Cozzene, will try to remain unbeaten in her third start when she
takes on seven others in the eighth at Gulfstream Park. The race is
at a mile on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Ian Jory. Besides winning the San Luis Obispo with the
overdue Continental Red on Saturday, the trainer took the $150,000
Pelleteri Breeders' Cup Handicap with 7-1 shot Explicit on Sunday at
the Fair Grounds in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Don Warren. The trainer has begun the year two for 51.
He will send out Ruhl An Rein in today's sixth at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Lady Cara, J Vivendi and
Salish Slew in the second, singling Sentimental Secret in the third
and using Yankee Pirate, In Season and Under Surveillance in the
fourth.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan practiced Tuesday with the Washington Wizards for the
first time since undergoing knee surgery, but said he has no plans to
play tonight against the Nuggets or Thursday at Utah.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan had been rehabilitating his right knee since his Feb. 27
surgery and was not with the team for the first four games of its
current seven-game trip. Washington is 2-2 on the trip but 4-10 since
Jordan had torn cartilage removed.</LD>
<LD>   It has been speculated that Jordan could return Sunday against the
Raptors at Toronto.</LD>
<TE>   Team spokesman Matt Williams said Jordan has not specified the
date of a possible return.</TE>
<TE>   Washington (31-36) is in sixth place in the Atlantic Division and
10th in the Eastern Conference, 21/2 games out of the playoffs, with
15 games remaining.</TE>

<HD>Hearn Plans to Return on April 9</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn, who hasn't announced a game in three
months because of two major surgeries, plans to return for an April 9
game against the Utah Jazz at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The 85-year-old Hearn, who had open-heart surgery in December and
hip surgery last month, will make his first visit to Staples Center
on March 29 in the once-unthinkable role of spectator. The Lakers
then leave on a week-long eastern swing.</LD>
<LD>   But upon their return, Hearn will be back behind the Laker
microphone where he has been for 42 seasons. He will finish the
regular season with four games at Staples Center and a game at
Portland and then continue on into the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Hearn was last heard doing the play-by-play of the Laker-Golden
State Warrior game at Staples Center on Dec. 16, his 3,338th
consecutive broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctors say I'm right on schedule," said Hearn by phone.
"Actually, they say I'm ahead of schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Springer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio Spurs have not played since Saturday, so they will
have had nearly four days off by the time the Lakers arrive at the
Alamodome tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, meanwhile, will have played the Mavericks twice in the
same period.</TE>
<TE>   While a busy schedule often leaves the veteran Lakers
vulnerable--the team is 7-8 in the second of back-to-back
games--Laker Coach Phil Jackson said that the frequency of quality
opponents might work to enliven the Laker legs.</TE>
<TE>   In the next four weeks, only two Laker opponent--the Cleveland
Cavaliers and Phoenix Suns--have no chance at the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It keys us up," Jackson said. "We're better off playing good
teams."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though the Golden State Warriors were assumed to be a potential
destination for former Laker executive Jerry West, an official there
said the Warriors wouldn't be a player.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Rowell, the chief operating officer, told the Contra Costa
Times that the Warriors had not contacted West and that they weren't
likely to.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had any discussion with him at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. San Antonio, 5 PST</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9, TNT</TE>
<TE>   Site--Alamodome</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC-AM (570)</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 47-19, Spurs 45-21.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Spurs--2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Lakers beat the Spurs twice in a week in January, by
17 points in San Antonio and then by three in Los Angeles. Shaquille
O'Neal did not play in the first game, and Kobe Bryant averaged 27.5
points.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just because Steve Lavin is used to midseason mediocrity followed by
NCAA excellence doesn't mean the UCLA coach enjoys it.</LD>
<LD>   "UCLA basketball and USC football are unique," Lavin said Tuesday
at Pauley Pavilion. "You lose one and the Bruins are in ruins. Lose
two of three or four of six and it's time for a coaching change.</LD>
<LD>   "We're only as good as our players. That's why I get a kick out of
coaches being [called] geniuses."</LD>
<TE>   But while Lavin compared himself to both a human dartboard and a
human pinata, the Bruin players have no idea how Lavin continues to
pull rabbits out of his March Madness hat.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably has something underneath all that gel [in his hair],"
senior guard Rico Hines said. "He's got a lot of stuff in there so
maybe he does have a rabbit."</TE>
<TE>   Said senior forward Matt Barnes: "I have no idea. Something about
the tournament ... he brings the best out of us.</TE>
<TE>   "We put ourselves in a position to be criticized. Now that we're
winning, it's in one ear and out the other."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   Crises and Triumphs of Steve Lavin as coach of the UCLA Bruins:</TE>
<TE>   THIS SEASON</TE>
<TE>   Low point: UCLA was hapless in a loss to California in the first
round of the Pacific 10 Conference tournament, capping a two-month
stretch of mediocre play.</TE>
<TE>   High point: A 105-101 double-overtime upset of No. 1-seeded
Cincinnati followed a 22-point victory over Mississippi, vaulting the
Bruins into a Sweet 16 game against Missouri on Thursday in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   2000-01</TE>
<TE>   Low point: UCLA started slowly, losing to Cal State Northridge and
Georgia Tech, and was 4-4 after a loss to North Carolina. The team
had just begun to build momentum, winning three in a row in early
January, when Athletic Director Pete Dalis mentioned during a news
conference that he had spoken to Rick Pitino about replacing Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   High point: After the Dalis faux pas, the Bruins went 13-3 until
losing at Washington in the regular-season finale, then beat Hofstra
and Utah State in the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet 16
where they lost to eventual-champion Duke.</TE>
<TE>   1999-2000</TE>
<TE>   Low point: UCLA was 4-8 in the Pacific 10 Conference after getting
swept at Arizona State and Arizona, prompting critics to label the
team as the worst in school history.</TE>
<TE>   High point: The Bruins promptly won eight in a row, including a
one-point overtime victory at Stanford with the winning basket coming
from JaRon Rush in his return from an NCAA suspension. The streak
continued into the NCAA tournament, where UCLA beat Ball State and
crushed Maryland by 35 points to reach the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   1998-1999</TE>
<TE>   Low point: Lavin's youngest team featured sophomores Baron Davis
and Earl Watson along with freshmen Jerome Moiso, Dan Gadzuric and
Rush. Losses at Cal and Stanford in February ended any visions of a
Pac-10 title.</TE>
<TE>   High point: The Bruins bounced back to beat USC and Syracuse,
starting a five-game winning streak. However, the regular season
ended with a loss to Arizona and a first-round NCAA elimination by
Detroit Mercy.</TE>
<TE>   1997-1998</TE>
<TE>   Low point: With Kris Johnson and Jelani McCoy suspended for
breaking team rules and freshmen guards Davis and Watson in the
starting lineup, the Bruins lost their opener to North Carolina by 41
points in Anchorage, Alaska. UCLA also stumbled into the NCAA
tournament, having lost to Arizona, Washington and Duke in the last
two weeks of the regular season without McCoy, who left the team.</TE>
<TE>   High point: UCLA stormed Atlanta, the site of the first two rounds
of the NCAA tournament, beating Miami and upsetting No. 12-ranked
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   1996-1997</TE>
<TE>   Low point: Lavin was an interim coach and UCLA got ambushed at
Stanford in what was called the Maples Massacre, a 48-point loss that
remains the worst in school history.</TE>
<TE>   High point: The Bruins beat Stanford at Pauley Pavilion, Lavin's
interim tag was removed and UCLA reeled off 11 more wins in a row,
including a thrilling third-round NCAA tournament game against Iowa
State in which Cameron Dollar drove the length of the court to score
the winning basket in overtime.</TE>

<LD>Rod Thorn helped write the NBA rules, spending 14 years as a league
executive. On Tuesday night, the president of the New Jersey Nets
insisted the referees ruled incorrectly in New Jersey's 100-97 loss
to the Cavaliers at Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Thorn and the Nets believed Lamond Murray's game-winning
three-pointer from the corner should have been waved off.</LD>
<LD>   There were 0.5 seconds to play when Andre Miller inbounded the
ball, and Murray was able to catch it and shoot it before the buzzer
sounded.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously it was late," Thorn said. "When you catch the ball
sideways, it is impossible to [score]. That is just unbelievable,
absolutely unbelievable. It has nothing to do with the clock, it is
the referees' decision about when the clock gets turned on."</TE>
<TE>   Referees Leon Wood, Joe Forte and Bennie Adams refused to comment.
All three wore belt packs that can activate the clock when a button
is pushed. Television replays showed Murray releasing the ball before
the clock reached zero.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the things on, but sometimes you forget," Thorn said.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn had tied the score, 97-97, with a three-pointer
moments earlier after taking an inbounds pass from Jason Kidd, who

<HD>Hamilton Hired to Coach Seminoles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leonard Hamilton, who rebuilt the University of Miami basketball
program, was hired as the coach at Florida State on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 53-year-old Hamilton replaces Steve Robinson, who was fired
last week after the Seminoles completed a fourth consecutive losing
season.</LD>
<LD>   Florida State went 18-14 and made the NCAA tournament during
Robinson's first season in 1997-98, but lost at least 17 games in
each of the last four seasons. The Seminoles went 12-17 this season,
including a 4-12 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference, although
they handed defending national champion Duke its first loss of the
season on Jan. 6.</LD>
<TE>   "I see no reason why we can't develop a basketball program with a
similar type of success as football and baseball," Hamilton said.
Florida State's football program has won two national championships,
and the baseball team is ranked No. 1 in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton coached at Miami for 10 seasons from 1991-2000, leading
the Hurricanes to a winning record in each of his last six seasons.
The team went to the NCAA tournament in his final three seasons,
reaching the final 16 in 2000, after making only one tournament
appearance in 40 years before he took over the program.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton left Miami to take over the Washington Wizards, but
lasted only one season.</TE>
<TE>   He resigned after Washington struggled to a 19-63 record last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Coach Bob Bender is out after three consecutive losing
seasons, a source close to the school's athletic department confirmed
to the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   It was unknown whether Bender was being fired or was resigning,
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to comment on reports that Bender would be replaced, Jim
Daves, Washington's sports information director, would say only that
an announcement concerning the basketball program was planned for
today.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia received permission to talk with Cincinnati Coach
Bob Huggins about its vacant coaching job.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that West Virginia has a great interest in Bob Huggins,"
Cincinnati Athletic Director Bob Goin said.</TE>
<TE>   "What has yet to be determined is how high Bob Huggins' interest
is in the West Virginia position."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins said Monday night he had talked with Goin but had not
talked with anybody from West Virginia. Goin declined to say if he
has a meeting with Huggins this week.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia Athletic Director Ed Pastilong drove 80 miles Sunday
to Pittsburgh to watch Cincinnati in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins was born in Morgantown, W.Va., played for West Virginia,
graduated from the school and began his coaching career there in 1977
as a graduate assistant.</TE>
<TE>   He has told Cincinnati President Joseph Steger he would someday
like to coach the Mountaineers.</TE>
<TE>   The West Virginia job opened when Gale Catlett, a former
Cincinnati coach, said in February he was retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan Richardson's future as basketball coach at Arkansas will not
be decided until today at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   B. Alan Sugg, president of the university system, is "considering
matters presented by Mr. Richardson in their meeting ... and does not
anticipate reaching his decision until he has conducted a thorough
review," according to a release from his office.</TE>
<TE>   Sugg is trying to decide whether to overturn Chancellor John
White's decision to buy out the last six years of Richardson's
contract for $500,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Richardson supplied a stack of documents that he hoped
would persuade Sugg to reverse the decision.</TE>
<TE>   South Alabama's Bob Weltlich resigned as coach following a 7-21
season, the worst in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Joe Gottfried said Weltlich and the university
"mutually agreed" he should step down.</TE>
<TE>   Weltlich, who was 81-65 at South Alabama, had three years left on
the contract he signed in July.</TE>
<TE>   He will receive $197,500 and use of a car for six months as part
of his buyout.</TE>
<TE>   Weltlich led the Jaguars to three regular-season Sun Belt
Conference titles in five years.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Open to Site Downtown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Tuesday that he is very
supportive of the idea of building a football stadium in downtown Los
Angeles but stopped short of endorsing a proposal being floated by
Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz.</LD>
<LD>   "I think a football stadium downtown would be very exciting," Hahn
said. "Certainly, Staples made a huge contribution and a positive one
to downtown Los Angeles, and I think a football stadium would be
positive as well.</LD>
<LD>   "The devil's in the details here, but I think the will is there,
the commitment is there, the enthusiasm is there, and I want to
support it in any way I can."</LD>
<TE>   The mayor said he has met with real-estate magnate Ed Roski, who
is working with Anschutz on the proposal. But Hahn said he has also
spoken to other potential investors who want to finance their own
deals, including Michael Ovitz and Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be working with whoever ends up wanting to do a deal," Hahn
said. "All I'm committed to is seeing that we get a team here."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who has said he believes Los Angeles will have a NFL team
within five years, said Tuesday that he senses a lot of enthusiasm
for the project among NFL officials.</TE>
<TE>   "They recognize this is a very important media market that they're
just not in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said that a deal would require a large amount of private
capital, and said Staples Center offered a good model of how the
project could be financed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a huge public subsidy is out of the question," Hahn said.
"That's just not going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a project that I think can be done with private capital and
private partners. We'll look for ways that we can streamline the
approval process, we'll look for ways that tax revenues that are
generated on site like ticket taxes ... can go back into the
project."</TE>
<TE>   City Controller Laura Chick said she would support the project if
it involved minimal risk to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it with Staples, and if we can do it again for a football
stadium and bring a team, I think it would be exciting for the city,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said that the proposal of building a new stadium does
not mean that there is no hope left of renovating the Coliseum to
house a football team, but warned that the city should not limit its
options.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Coliseum would be a great place for a football team,
but at the end of the day, I think we made an error last time saying
it was basically a take-it-or-leave-it proposal, and if it wasn't at
the Coliseum, we weren't interested," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, a major proponent
of bringing a team to the Coliseum three years ago, said he believes
that site should still be considered. And he questioned whether
enough land could be assembled to build a stadium near Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a gargantuan challenge," Ridley-Thomas said. "They
have to demonstrate that it can be done."</TE>

<TE>   NFL owners made some minor rules modifications Tuesday but took a
pass on the two centerpiece issues of their meetings in Orlando,
Fla.--the "tuck" rule and an option to buy a piece of the Arena
Football League--deciding to further examine them in the months to
come.</TE>
<TE>   Eight NFL owners have purchased Arena franchises, and the NFL has
the option to acquire 49.9% of the league before March 31. The
measure would have required 24 of 32 votes to pass.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't reach a consensus," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   Had the NFL exercised its option, it would have shared the Arena
league's advertising, merchandising and sponsorship revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has some positive elements," Baltimore Raven owner Art
Modell said. "We have to cultivate it and see if it blends with what
we do."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Steeler owner Dan Rooney said he has reservations about
arena football, especially if the league plans to compete with NFL
Europe for players.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really consider [arena] to be the same kind of football
that we play, that colleges play, that high schools play, that they
play in Europe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The owners, general managers and coaches also discussed the tuck
rule, which says that if a quarterback's arm is moving forward in a
throwing motion, it's considered a pass attempt, even if he loses
possession as he's trying to tuck the ball into his body.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Raiders believe that rule robbed them of a playoff
victory at New England, after an apparent fumble by Patriot
quarterback Tom Brady in the final minutes of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "We discussed the rule in an open forum," said Tampa Bay General
Manager Rich McKay, chairman of the competition committee. "It didn't
get clearer, it got murkier."</TE>
<TE>   Among the rules that passed:</TE>
<TE>   * When the visiting team has the ball and the clock is running,
the home team cannot pipe music or artificial crowd noise through its
stadium speakers.</TE>
<TE>   * The clock will no longer stop in the last two minutes when a
quarterback is sacked. In the past, it stopped for about five
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal to give the receiving team the ball on a botched
on-side kick was rejected in favor of giving the kicking team another
chance from five yards back.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Neither Louisville nor an ankle injury could stop Lynn Greer.</LD>
<LD>   Greer scored 20 of his 27 points in the second half Tuesday night
and Temple rallied from a 16-point halftime deficit to beat the
Cardinals, 65-62, at Louisville, Ky., in the second round of the
National Invitation Tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "We got beat by a great basketball player," Louisville Coach Rick
Pitino said. "It was a fabulous performance by a gutty player. He
made some great shots."</LD>
<TE>   The Owls (17-14) trailed, 38-22, at halftime, making only 10 of 31
shots from the field.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first half, we did a pretty good job of getting shots--we
just weren't knocking them down," Greer said.</TE>
<TE>   Temple Coach John Chaney was predictably angry at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach said, 'If you're not going to play in the second half, stay
in the locker room,'" said Kevin Lyde, who finished with 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Temple started the second half with a 17-6 run by making six of
eight shots.</TE>
<TE>   Reece Gaines scored 16 points for Louisville (19-13).</TE>

<HD>Flash Point</HD>
<DH>Showy Guard Ridnour Is the Impetus for Oregon's Rapid Rise</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing up in Blaine, Wash., Luke Ridnour carried a basketball
wherever he went--to school, to the store, to the movies, even to
bed.</LD>
<LD>   So if it was no real surprise when the hoops junkie showed up for
a date toting one, that didn't mean the young lady liked having a
basketball as a chaperon. The date ended quickly, not that Ridnour
minded. He already had his first love cradled in his arms.</LD>
<LD>   "If they don't like basketball, I can't date them," Ridnour said
with a sly grin. "It's part of me and it's part of what I've always
been about."</LD>
<TE>   And that's just fine with the Oregon fans, who have developed a
love affair of their own with the flashy, play-making sophomore point
guard. In Oregon's first Sweet 16 appearance since the Eisenhower
administration, Ridnour is leading the Ducks' entertaining "Quack
Attack" to national prominence. Oregon (25-8), second-seeded in the
Midwest Regional, will play sixth-seeded Texas (22-11) Friday in
Madison, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   If the Ducks' high-octane offense is a Porsche, then the 6-foot-2,
165-pound ballhandler extraordinaire has the keys.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon began tournament play averaging 85.9 points, third
nationally, and Ridnour gets the running game going, wowing the crowd
and opponents with his whip-like passes around the perimeter and
no-look, behind-the-back bounce passes in transition.</TE>
<TE>   The spectacular yet steady Ridnour has been compared to John
Stockton of the Utah Jazz and Jason Williams of the Memphis
Grizzlies, but the Oregon floor general prefers the late "Pistol"
Pete Maravich.</TE>
<TE>   "He just had that flair," said Ridnour, who studies videos of
Maravich. "You can really get the crowd involved when you make a good
play."</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour made plenty of them in the Ducks' victories over Montana
and Wake Forest last weekend in Sacramento, their first NCAA
tournament victories since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   He scored 46 points against the Grizzlies and Demon Deacons, going
for a career-high 28 against Wake Forest with a career-best seven
three-point baskets. He also had five assists and six turnovers in
the two games.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have so much fun out there," said Duck small forward Luke
Jackson, who shares a house with Ridnour and teammates Jay Anderson
and James Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes he'll make a great play and that just energizes our
team. You know we love to run and get it out on the floor, and he
gets us going by doing that."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't always fun and games for Ridnour in an Oregon
uniform.</TE>
<TE>   A prep All-American whose father, Rob, was his coach at Blaine
High, Ridnour was recruited by Utah, Kentucky, Gonzaga and Washington
before choosing Oregon. His high school team had won consecutive
state titles and gone a combined 97-11, so when the Ducks had an
uninspiring 14-14 season last year, he considered transferring.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pacific 10 Conference freshman of the year stuck it out
and, with most of the Ducks remaining in Eugene for the summer, he
coordinated spirited scrimmages and workouts at McArthur Court that
often lasted until 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The extra work paid off for Ridnour and the other Ducks, who,
after being picked to finish sixth, claimed their first outright
conference championship since the 1939 Tall Firs won the first NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour has more than doubled his scoring average, from 7.4 points
as a freshman to 15.6 points, and his assists-to-turnovers ratio has
improved, from 1.58 to 1.71.</TE>
<TE>   With 164 assists, Ridnour is 20 behind the school's single-season
leader, Ron Lee. Having knocked down 86 three-point baskets this
season, Ridnour, who's shooting 44.6% from three-point territory, is
nine from passing the school's single-season record holder, Orlando
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour's proficiency from beyond the arc is a major reason Oregon
has made a Pacific 10-record 287 three-pointers, eclipsing Arizona's
8-year-old single-season mark of 279.</TE>
<TE>   Said Oregon senior shooting guard Frederick Jones, "He knows the
game and I think that's what sets him apart from all the other
guards. I've had a lot of guards that I've played with that are very
talented and can handle the ball and do a lot of different things.
But I'm not sure any of them understood the game the way Luke does."</TE>
<TE>   But Ridnour, Jones said, is not all flash. There's some ferocity
behind his Howdy Doody face.</TE>
<TE>   "He has that toughness to him, that if you're not helping him out,
he's going to let you know," Jones said. "He doesn't want to be the
highlight of the game. He wants to have everyone involved and get
everything going."</TE>
<TE>   You might think that being Ridnour's coach could be a daily lesson
in stress management, that watching him take chances with the ball
before making spectacular plays would be both exasperating and
satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun. It's not maddening at all," said Oregon Coach Ernie
Kent. "I wish I could have played that way. I enjoy watching him play
but, unfortunately for me, I have to go home and watch it on TV to
really appreciate how good that guy is."</TE>
<TE>   Kent, who had an inkling as to what kind of gym rat he had on his
hands when Ridnour stepped off the plane for his recruiting visit
carrying a basketball, has rewarded the creative Ridnour by giving
him additional freedoms on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "He allows me to do some flashy things most of the time," Ridnour
said. "Well, as long as it's not too out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you build his trust, you can do things and if you still
produce, he'll let you just play and express yourself on the court.
It's just up-and-down fun basketball, and I think that's what any
basketball player in this day and age wants to do, just run and play
and have fun. Truly, you just get to express yourself on the court
and that's what Coach Kent preaches and lets you do."</TE>

<LD>The sooner the courts deal with the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission's
misguided lawsuit against U.S. Soccer and Major League Soccer, the
better off the sport will be in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Until the suit is resolved, the ludicrous situation occurring here
this week will continue to be an issue.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, MLS opens its seventh season with a game between the
Galaxy and D.C. United at the Rose Bowl, a game that normally could
be expected to draw a good crowd.</LD>
<TE>   But on Tuesday night at the Coliseum, there was another game, one
between two popular teams from the Mexican first division, Chivas of
Guadalajara and UNAM Pumas of Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   The game, won by Pumas, 1-0, attracted an estimated 20,000 fans.
Their money spent, it's unlikely that many of those same fans will be
at the Rose Bowl on Saturday evening.</TE>
<TE>   So why were Chivas and Pumas playing in Los Angeles four days
before the start of the MLS season? Why was the game even allowed to
be played when it obviously will hurt the Galaxy's attendance?</TE>
<TE>   Because it's a free country and promoters can put on any game they
like, any time they like, if they think they can make a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, even meaningless exhibitions such as Tuesday's can
be profitable. The demographics of the city mean that teams from
Mexico and Central America invariably draw bigger crowds than MLS
teams.</TE>
<TE>   And MLS is powerless to do anything about it--unless, as the
Coliseum Commission's lawsuit claims, U.S. Soccer steps in and lends
a hand.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, games involving foreign teams have to be
sanctioned by U.S. Soccer, the national governing body for the sport.
The federation usually just rubber-stamps such requests and takes its
percentage of the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, says the Coliseum Commission. Its lawsuit claims that the
federation has conspired to protect MLS teams at the expense of
independent promoters.</TE>
<TE>   The suit challenges the federation's right to have any say over
the staging of games and also challenges the fees U.S. Soccer charges
for allowing them.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a lawsuit likely to be won. Despite its name, the Ted
Stevens Amateur Sports Act of 1978 clearly gives U.S. Soccer the
right to govern the sport in this country on both the amateur and
professional levels.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is more of a nuisance, a desperate clutching at straws by
a Coliseum Commission fearfully contemplating all the soccer business
in Los Angeles disappearing down the Harbor Freeway to Carson, where
the Anschutz Entertainment Group's 27,000-seat soccer-specific
stadium for the Galaxy will open next year.</TE>
<TE>   The financial resources of AEG are enormous, compared to those of
the independent promoters that the Coliseum deals with, and AEG will
be able to showcase all kinds of top foreign teams without there
being any conflict with MLS.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Soccer might reasonably have withheld approval for the
Chivas-Pumas game simply because it did clash with the Galaxy's MLS
opener.</TE>
<TE>   That's not conspiracy, that's common sense. U.S. Soccer's mandate
is to grow the game in this country, and it can do so only by
fostering the development of an American league which, in turn,
develops American players.</TE>
<TE>   But with the lawsuit hanging over it, U.S. Soccer could not turn
down the Chivas-Pumas match without hurting its own case in court.</TE>
<TE>   So it approved it, just as it had approved a March 6 game in San
Jose between Chivas and La Piedad that ended up attracting 18,259
spectators, thousands more than the MLS-champion Earthquakes averaged
in the same Spartan Stadium last season.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, if U.S. Soccer allows such games to take place at the
expense of MLS, there can be no conspiracy between the federation and
the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum Commission would be better off building bridges with
U.S. Soccer, MLS and AEG than filing lawsuits. There are major games
that can be brought to Los Angeles, games for which a 27,000-seat
stadium will be woefully inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   So where will they go? Right now, the Rose Bowl is a far more
attractive option than the Coliseum.</TE>

<DH>Analysis: Several teams make major deals before trade
deadline, with Rangers, Colorado and Philadelphia doing the best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NHL's annual fire sale ended Tuesday and, as expected, the
league's better off franchises stepped up the most, Colorado,
Philadelphia and the New York Rangers making the best deals to boost
their playoff runs.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado picked up defenseman Darius Kasparaitis from Pittsburgh
for forward Ville Nieminen and defenseman Rick Berry. Philadelphia
acquired veteran center Adam Oates from Washington for goalie
prospect Maxime Ouellet and the Flyers' first-, second- and
third-round picks in this summer's draft. The Rangers added
defenseman Tom Poti and center Rem Murray from Edmonton for left wing
Mike York and a 2002 fourth-round pick.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey and Dallas, teams that replaced Stanley Cup-winning
coaches this season, were involved in a blockbuster deal. The Devils
sent forwards Jason Arnott and Randy McKay, along with a first-round
pick, to the Stars for forwards Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie
Langenbrunner.</LD>
<TE>   "Over the last few years, there has been a lot of activity around
the trade deadline," said a Western Conference general manager, whose
team is in the thick of the playoff race. "But the big thing about
this year's deadline was that we didn't see a lot of big name players
who will be unrestricted free agents this summer get moved.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't see [Bill] Guerin or Byron Dafoe get traded out of
Boston, or Tony Amonte with Chicago or Teemu Selanne with San Jose.
It seems that their teams have decided to keep them for now and then
take their chances trying to sign them after the season."</TE>
<TE>   One team that always seems to be ready to deal at the last minute
is Colorado, and Avalanche General Manager Pierre Lacroix didn't
disappoint this time around. By landing Kasparaitis, the Avalanche
got a high-profile defenseman late in the season for the second
consecutive year. Last year, they won the Stanley Cup after acquiring
Rob Blake from the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Kasparaitis is a great acquisition for Colorado, not only because
he is a tough and physical player but also because the Avalanche kept
Western Conference rival Detroit from getting him. The Red Wings have
been cruising all season but their defense has lacked a player like
Kasparaitis.</TE>
<TE>   After failing to land Kasparaitis, Detroit traded for Atlanta
defenseman Jiri Slegr, who has played in only 38 games this season
because of various injuries. Slegr, who has 51 penalty minutes and a
minus-21 rating this season, has played in 34 playoff games, compared
to 60 for Kasparaitis.</TE>
<TE>   The key to the deal was that Lacroix was the only general manager
willing to offer the Penguins two NHL players, not just prospects.
That was a high price, considering that Kasparaitis will probably
become an unrestricted free agent this summer. The Red Wings still
remain the team to beat, but the gap between them and the Avalanche
just narrowed.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tossup, trying to figure whether Dallas or New Jersey got
the better of their deal.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, it's quality for quality. Let's not look at it any
other way," New Jersey President Lou Lamoriello said. "Both teams are
in similar situations, coming off long, successful runs, but they
needed to make a change. It's not change for change's sake, though."</TE>
<TE>   The Stars and Devils are fighting to make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas, which fired Coach Ken Hitchcock earlier this season, is
fourth in the Pacific Division and trails Vancouver by one point for
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. New
Jersey, which fired Larry Robinson, is seventh in the Eastern
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   With the additions of Nieuwendyk and Langenbrunner, the Devils may
benefit the most immediately, but in the long run, the Stars should
end up with the better deal because Arnott, 27, is not only bigger
and stronger than Nieuwendyk but also eight years younger.</TE>
<TE>   In the East, Philadelphia becomes a much stronger playoff team
with Oates, who will also be an unrestricted free agent this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers needed a quality forward to offset the recent injuries
to Jeremy Roenick and Keith Primeau, both expected to be sidelined at
least two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers also made some good moves to help their playoff
chance. With the recent addition of Pavel Bure, who was acquired from
Florida on Monday, and the trade for Poti and Murray, the Rangers
will have one of the most dangerous offenses in the East.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Hines Will Sit Out This Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson and Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The solitary shooter with "Hines" on the back of his jersey hit jump
shot after jump shot Tuesday at Pauley Pavilion, oblivious to the
throng of reporters converging on his Bruin teammates and coach.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't senior guard Rico Hines honing his shooting touch
for the Sweet 16 game against Missouri on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   It was redshirt Ray Young, and he wore the jersey as a tribute to
his injured teammate.</LD>
<TE>   An MRI on Hines' left knee revealed a cartilage tear that will
sideline him this weekend. He injured the knee Sunday in the first
half of UCLA's double-overtime victory over Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Hines, an outstanding defensive player who averages 16.2 minutes a
game, said he might be able to play in the Final Four next week if
UCLA advances. In his absence, he expects freshman Dijon Thompson to
pick up extra playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "He's coming into his own," Hines said. "He's not a freshman
anymore, that's what I told him. He's playing like a sophomore."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson scored 16 points in UCLA's first-round victory over
Mississippi and 10 against Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready for whatever comes," Thompson said. "I've been playing
better since I stopped thinking so much and second-guessing myself.
I'm just playing confident."</TE>
<TE>   As for Hines, he will be on the UCLA bench exhorting his teammates
the same way he did on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always wanted to coach, so I told him this is an early start
to his coaching career," Coach Steve Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Barnes, who was born in San Jose and grew up in Sacramento,
said he has been inundated with more than 30 ticket requests from
family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he hopes this trip to the Bay Area works out better
for him than the Bruins' last journey north.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I went home I got kicked out of the game," Barnes
said. "So hopefully that doesn't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes was referring to his being booted after giving California
guard Shantay Legans a forearm shiver to the head.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lavin said he was worried about freshman point guard Cedric
Bozeman becoming so frustrated and disenchanted with his status that
he would check out mentally.</TE>
<TE>   So he had former Bruin Earl Watson, now playing for the Seattle
SuperSonics, call Bozeman and freshman Ryan Walcott on Friday in an
effort to pump them up.</TE>
<TE>   "The three of them share a commonality of being point guards at
UCLA," Lavin said, "of trying to shoulder the burdens of high
expectations of UCLA basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "Earl told them that at UCLA, your highs are higher and your lows
are lower. When Earl went through what they're going through, he was
a junior. [Bozeman and Walcott] are freshmen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With UCLA and Missouri meeting in a West Regional semifinal,
attention has been focused on Tyus Edney's mad, full-court dash that
ended with him flipping in a game-winning basket at the buzzer
against the Tigers in the 1995 NCAA tournament. Story lines also have
turned to Missouri forward Kareem Rush and his older brother JaRon, a
former Bruin.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in the shuffle is how close Jason Kapono was to going to
Missouri out of Artesia High in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to play for [former Missouri coach] Norm Stewart and, at
the time, I wanted to play out of state," said Kapono, who also
strongly considered Nevada Las Vegas. "But growing up, I always
wanted to be a Bruin." Paul Gutierrez</TE>

<HD>Man Suffers Burns in Fire That Destroys Santa Paula Condos</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Resident sparks the blaze while doing vehicle
repair work in the building's garage. Twenty-three tenants are
displaced.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 50-year-old man was hospitalized with second-degree burns, and
nearly two dozen people were displaced when fire destroyed a six-unit
condominium complex in Santa Paula on Tuesday afternoon, fire
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire started about noon at the two-story Monterey condominiums
in the 200 block of West Santa Barbara Street, said Capt. John Harber
of the Santa Paula Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   The four upper units were gutted, and two lower units were damaged
by water, Harber said.</LD>
<TE>   About 60 firefighters from Santa Paula, Fillmore and the Ventura
County departments battled the blaze until about 1:50 p.m., Harber
said.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Lopez Viveros, a resident of the complex, was replacing a
fuel pump on a pickup in the garage beneath the complex when he
accidentally sparked the fire, Harber said.</TE>
<TE>   Viveros suffered burns to his hands, face and upper body and was
taken to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital for treatment, Harber said.</TE>
<TE>   He was in stable condition, said Ventura County Fire Department
spokeswoman Sandi Wells.</TE>
<TE>   No other people were reported injured.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross workers arrived to assist the 23 residents, including
children, who were displaced by the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   The evacuees will be provided with food, clothing and shelter,
Harber said.</TE>
<TE>   Children from nearby Glen City School were taken to the Santa
Paula Community Center on Main Street after school to protect them
from heavy smoke, Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   Students from Isbell Middle School and Santa Paula High School
also were asked to move to the community center for after-school
programs Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Ojai Losing Students, Cuts Teachers</HD>
<DH>Education: The school district will eliminate 12 positions
because of falling enrollment. Officials blame the high price of
homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Declining enrollment is causing one Ventura County school district to
cut 12 teaching jobs next year, which officials blame on high housing
prices and stagnant growth.</LD>
<LD>   Ojai Unified, a small district serving about 3,900 students,
expects to lose 190 next year--nearly double last year's enrollment
dip of 100 students. The accompanying reduction in state funding
requires eliminating about 12 full-time teaching positions, Supt. Van
Riley said.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the cuts will come from employees retiring, transferring
or leaving on their own, but district officials have sent layoff
notices to three elementary school teachers.</LD>
<TE>   "It's huge and it's a major concern," Riley said. "They're great
teachers, and we would love to keep them."</TE>
<TE>   Economists say what is happening in Ojai could be a warning for
other school districts in Ventura County as people with children are
priced out of the area for lack of new housing.</TE>
<TE>   Housing prices "are much too high, which is preventing families or
anyone from moving in, and therefore it will have an impact on
schools," said Mark Schniepp, director of the California Economic
Forecast in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   He said part of the enrollment decline comes from a basic
demographic shift. Numbers of children ages 5 to 11 are peaking, but
will drop off for the next several years.</TE>
<TE>   This trend is exacerbated in areas of high housing costs with
little new development, including Ojai, Schniepp said. In January,
the median price of a home in this bucolic enclave at the foot of Los
Padres National Forest was $372,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be a trend in play, and Ojai's just the first to make some
racket here," Schniepp said. "I would look for this to continue all
over the county."</TE>
<TE>   School districts from Santa Barbara to Oak Park have seen
similar--though less drastic--dips in enrollment since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   However, most of those agencies are still showing some enrollment
growth. In Conejo Valley Unified, about 300 new students enrolled
last fall, and officials expect about 200 new pupils in the next
school year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Conejo and other districts said they don't believe
Ojai's enrollment drop will necessarily be repeated in their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not much larger than us, so that's kind of scary," said
Robert Fraser, an assistant superintendent in Oak Park Unified School
District. "But I'm a bit more of an optimist due to our proximity to
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Fraser said a crucial factor is the hotly debated Ahmanson Ranch
development, which would put 3,050 new homes very close to the
district on the northeastern border of Ventura County. "Whether that
project goes in will have a major impact on us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Oak Park opened its high-achieving elementary schools
to out-of-district transfers after a temporary moratorium in an
attempt to boost enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   That solution won't work for Ojai, however. Officials in
neighboring Ventura Unified for the last few years have denied new
requests to transfer into Ojai's schools, where about 300 Ventura
students already attend, Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   The district is exploring options to recapture students from the
area's many private schools, including offering alternative and
independent study programs.</TE>
<TE>   And Riley said even as the Ojai district further tightens its
purse strings in the face of statewide budget cuts, school officials
are committed to maintaining educational excellence.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have smaller schools, but we're offering the same
programs and stability," Riley said. "We will try to keep the
reductions away from classrooms, and I think we can do it."</TE>

<HD>Dad Pleads Not Guilty in Carbon Monoxide Deaths of 5
Children</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 30-year-old Pico Rivera man pleaded innocent Tuesday to killing
five of his six children by lighting a charcoal grill inside his
house last month as they slept.</LD>
<LD>   Adair Javier Garcia will return to Whittier Superior Court on
April 15 for a preliminary hearing where prosecutors may announce
that they will seek the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia is eligible for the death penalty because of three special
circumstances: lying in wait, murder by administration of poison and
multiple murder.</LD>
<TE>   He also is charged with attempted murder involving a sixth child,
Kassandra, who was hospitalized with severe carbon monoxide
poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-year-old was released from Childrens Hospital Los Angeles a
week after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia is being held without bail at Twin Towers Correctional
Facility, where he is under suicide watch and is being kept away from
other inmates for his own safety.</TE>
<TE>   Accused of Letting Charcoal Burn Indoors</TE>
<TE>   Garcia is accused of igniting a charcoal grill Feb. 20 in the
family's two-bedroom home in the 9600 block of Washington Boulevard
in Pico Rivera and leaving it to burn as the children slept,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's mother-in-law found him and the children the next morning
when she arrived to baby-sit.</TE>
<TE>   The family was unconscious from the grill's carbon monoxide fumes.
Brenda, 10; Jonathan, 7; and Anthony, 2, died at the scene. Cecilia,
4, died later that day and Vanessa, 6, died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters initially assumed that the charcoal grill was being
used to warm the house, but later investigators determined that it
was intentionally set.</TE>
<TE>   The night before, Garcia put his children to bed, lighted the
barbecue grill and allowed it to burn for hours, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Lt. Don Bear.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Garcia was depressed about his rocky marriage.
His wife, Adriana Arreola, had moved out of the home at least a week
before the deaths, Bear said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia appeared briefly in court Tuesday, spoke only to confirm
his not-guilty plea, and occasionally looked into the crowd, where a
few family members sat.</TE>
<TE>   Since the killings, Garcia's family has not spoken publicly about
the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   A private memorial March 2 and burial for the five children at
Rose Hills Memorial Cemetery in Whittier was attended only by family,
friends and Sheriff's Department investigators.</TE>

<HD>Telemarketer Pleads Guilty to Mail Fraud</HD>
<DH>Crime: San Juan Capistrano man accused of raising $27
million but giving only $1 million to charities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A telemarketing fund-raiser accused of bilking thousands of donors
out of more than $27 million pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court
in Santa Ana to single counts of mail fraud and money laundering,
according to the U.S. attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Gold, 44, of San Juan Capistrano also pleaded guilty to
another count of mail fraud in connection with a scheme to cheat
golfers out of $8 million. Gold, who remains in custody because of an
earlier bail violation, faces up to 35 years in prison. He could also
be required to pay $21 million in fines as well as restitution to
victims, according to prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Gold will be sentenced along with Jonathan Cohen, 29, of Tustin,
who pleaded guilty last week to a single count of mail fraud in each
case. Cohen faces similar penalties.</LD>
<TE>   The men were accused of using telemarketing firms around the
country to raise funds on behalf of veterans, firefighters, AIDS
patients and children's groups. Although the men raised $27 million,
only $1 million went to the charities.</TE>
<TE>   In the second case, both men were accused of giving golfers a
chance to test high-quality golf clubs for free, then charging them
$1,500 for the clubs. Although golfers were promised full refunds,
Gold and Cohen prevented most from recouping their money, authorities
charged.</TE>

<HD>Judge Kline Pleads Not Guilty in Molestation</HD>
<DH>Crime: The charges, however, are lessened after a second
interview with accuser, who was 14, not 12, at the time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline pleaded not guilty
Tuesday to reduced charges of molesting a 14-year-old boy more than
two decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Local prosecutors had previously accused Kline of committing lewd
acts on a 12-year-old boy between 1976 and 1978. Those charges
carried a maximum 14-year prison sentence.</LD>
<LD>   But after altering the charges Tuesday morning, prosecutors now
allege that Kline committed sex acts on the boy in 1979. Because the
boy was older at the time of the alleged crime than originally
believed, the new charges carry a reduced sentence of up to 5 years
and 8 months in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said in court documents that they made the alterations
after conducting a second interview last month with Kline's accuser,
now a 37-year-old man whose identity has never been made public.</TE>
<TE>   Though otherwise confined to his Irvine home on house arrest,
Kline stood silently in a Norwalk courtroom Tuesday morning while his
attorney, Paul S. Meyer, entered the plea on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegation is untrue," Meyer told reporters outside court.
"The case is based on a very late complaint raised 24 years after
events supposedly occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Kline, 61, also has pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges
of possessing child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the criminal charges, Kline remains a candidate for
reelection in November's general election. The jurist is seeking
permission to withdraw from the race, and his attorney is scheduled
to appear in a Los Angeles County court April 2 to ask a judge to
remove Kline's name from the upcoming ballot.</TE>

<HD>Occidental College Drops Plans for Lighted Softball Field</HD>
<DH>Education: The decision pleases neighbors who had called
the proposal a threat to their area's rustic ambience. A science hall
will be built.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing community opposition, Occidental College scrapped a plan to
build a softball field and hammer-throw ring, but will build a new
science building at the 120-acre campus in Eagle Rock, officials said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Residents who opposed the new fields and lighting because they
said they would destroy their hilly neighborhood's rustic ambience
were overjoyed by the college's decision.</LD>
<LD>   "I am thrilled," said physician Jeff Jacobs, who lives across the
street from the proposed softball field. "I'm pleased that in these
days, if people get together, they can actually get something done."</LD>
<TE>   Residents formed a group last year called Citizens Against
Excessive Noise and Lights, or CANAL, and collected more than 500
signatures opposing the college's plan. Some opposed the field
because they feared increased traffic on the narrow streets. Others
said the lights would be a glaring intrusion into nearby homes.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental officials filed a conditional use permit application
last year for the new science building. Part of the expansion
included the new softball diamond because they said Bell Field didn't
meet size regulations set by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.,
which governs intercollegiate athletics.</TE>
<TE>   School officials learned last month that city planners would
require only 62 new parking slots on campus to accommodate the
science building--a far cry from the 170 that had been planned for,
Occidental spokesman Jim Tranquada said.</TE>
<TE>   The need for fewer parking spaces prompted school officials to
rethink the elimination of Bell Field and the construction of a new
softball field on a three-acre, hilly parcel that the school owns
next to the main campus.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental President Theodore R. Mitchell then decided to enlarge
Bell Field to meet NCAA regulations and to abandon the new field and
lighting for the immediate future, Tranquada said.</TE>
<TE>   The school filed an amended application earlier this month to only
cover the science building's construction and minor work at the
campus football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the city decided we'd need only half of the parking we
thought we would [need], that enabled us to reconfigure things,"
Tranquada said.</TE>
<TE>   However, some CANAL members aren't entirely satisfied with
Occidental's compromise. Some are worried that the school may still
want to install stadium lights on nearby playing fields, noting that
Mitchell pointedly did not rule out the possibility of lights in the
future at a recent meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still very much on the table," said CANAL President Martin
Morgan, an acoustics engineer. "From that standpoint, we're kind of
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Occidental officials, stung by criticism that they
were bad neighbors because of the ball field proposal, are glad the
dispute appears to be over.</TE>
<TE>   "CANAL will say what CANAL will say," Tranquada said. "The college
has always been desirous of a good relationship with our neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   And despite the recent dust-up, even Morgan says he's still an
Occidental fan.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I'm very happy with the college," he said.</TE>

<HD>County Still Has Plenty of Airport Fight Left in It, Smith
Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In January 2000, I met Chuck Smith for lunch to ask whether he could
reverse the momentum that clearly was running against the proposed El
Toro airport. The supervisor, then Orange County government's most
visible pro-airport spokesman, was confident he could. He said he was
certain an El Toro airport would be built.</LD>
<LD>   I met Smith for coffee the other day to see how he was holding up
in the wake of Measure W's passage two weeks ago. That was the vote
many people believe finally killed an airport on the former Marine
base.</LD>
<LD>   We agreed to meet at the same restaurant. When we got there, we
found it had gone out of business.</LD>
<TE>   Metaphor, anyone?</TE>
<TE>   We drove on to another place down the street. Try as I might over
the next hour, I couldn't get Smith to burst into tears or fly into a
rage over the apparent demise of the El Toro project he'd championed
in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   It must be a very personal loss for you, I said.</TE>
<TE>   Nope, he replied.</TE>
<TE>   It must be your lowest political moment.</TE>
<TE>   Not by a long shot.</TE>
<TE>   You will concede, though, that an airport won't be built at El
Toro?</TE>
<TE>   Nope, he said, won't concede that.</TE>
<TE>   If I'm making it sound as though Smith is combative or in denial,
that's not the case. He's saying all this in good humor, while also
making it clear he won't be out front in reviving the issue. He won't
have to, he says, because the need for the airport will force the
issue back onto Orange County's plate somewhere down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the outcome of Measure W," he says. "It lost 60-40 in 21
North County cities. It won 85-15 in 13 South County cities. Voter
turnout was 35%, or something like that. There's a message there. The
outcome was ruled by a few very passionate people with a lot of money
[spent on the campaign].</TE>
<TE>   "Things could change when North County cities become more
passionate, when every time they go to LAX it becomes a zoo, when
they can't get a flight out of John Wayne Airport, when freeways are
jammed. Things could change."</TE>
<TE>   So, I ask, you wouldn't be stunned to see an El Toro airport in 20
years?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be stunned to see one in 10 to 15 years," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was the acknowledged leader of the three-member board
majority that pushed for the new airport, but he refuses to see the
defeat in personal terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any guilt feelings whatsoever," he says. "I think I
did everything I reasonably could have done to make it happen.... We
fought the good fight, and we didn't win it."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who will be 70 in July, says he'll spend the final 21/2
years of his term concentrating more on specific needs of his
ethnically diverse district, which includes Garden Grove, Westminster
and Santa Ana. Affordable housing for seniors and the working poor
top the to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   He'll keep an eye on El Toro, but when I ask what he won't
support, he says, "Illogical use of the base. I would fight that, and
that will include a Great Park, because of the cost of the cleanup
[from base contamination]."</TE>
<TE>   He doubts the Great Park envisioned by Measure W supporters will
ever be built.</TE>
<TE>   "If Measure W sticks--who knows, it probably will--it won't be my
problem, but it will be a future board's problem to figure out how to
meet the [air] traffic demand.... The airport is never dead, because
the demand is going to stay, and eventually that demand has to be
met. That's just the way things are."</TE>
<TE>   So, I suggest, you may be vindicated in 20 years?</TE>
<TE>   "In 20 years," he says, with a laugh, "I won't care."</TE>

<LD>A Thousand Oaks man has been arrested in the robbery of one bank and
the attempted holdup of a second in the Conejo Valley earlier this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Kurash, 34, was booked Monday at Ventura County Jail in
connection with the March 12 robbery of a Bank of America branch in
Agoura Hills and an unsuccessful robbery attempt the same day at a
World Savings Bank in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Kurash was being held without bail. An arraignment was set for
today, Ventura County Sheriff's Det. Eric Buschow said.</LD>
<TE>   The suspect was arrested after employees at a Thousand Oaks
grocery store called police while Kurash was trying to cash money
orders that he had bought there only hours before, Buschow said.
Officers said the cash used to purchase the money orders matched
bills stolen from the Agoura Hills bank.</TE>

<LD>Ventura College's executive vice president has been placed on paid
administrative leave and told his contract will be not be renewed
over allegations that he made negative comments about district
business.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Dyste, who oversaw academic affairs at the 12,000-student
campus, was suspended last week and told his employment would end
June 30, according to his attorney, Martha Torgow.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Community College District Chancellor Philip Westin
objected to comments Dyste allegedly made to colleagues, prompting
the chancellor to dismiss him, according to a claim for reinstatement
Dyste filed against the district.</LD>
<TE>   Dyste's claim states that he was exercising his free-speech rights
by bringing to light "certain proposed actions which would have been
in violation of the law or board policy."</TE>
<TE>   Torgow declined to be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   College officials have told Torgow they do not plan to settle the
matter, so she said late last week she would file a lawsuit.</TE>

<LD>The City Council has put off action aimed at shaping the future of
Ormond Beach, a 1,400-acre collection of seaside parcels at the
center of competing development interests.</LD>
<LD>   Following a three-hour public hearing last week, council members
delayed until April 9 choosing a plan for the south Oxnard property,
home to some of the county's most fragile wetlands and some of its
heaviest industry.</LD>
<LD>   Besieged by a flurry of proposals, city staff members recommend
breaking up the 1,400 acres into three planning areas, making
decisions more manageable.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists and nearby residents want the council to create
a master plan for the entire area, earmarking much of the property as
a wildlife preserve.</TE>

<HD>Decision Time for County Assessor</HD>
<DH>Law: Official has a week to tell judge if he will seek to
appeal ruling that could change property tax reassessments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge gave Orange County Assessor Webster J.
Guillory one week to decide if he will ask an appeals court to block
a ruling invalidating the county's method of assessing property,
which is used throughout the state.</LD>
<LD>   Judge John M. Watson urged Guillory's attorney, Robert D. Luskin,
to decide quickly so the case can be considered by the state's 4th
District Court of Appeal. Otherwise, Watson will begin the next phase
in Superior Court, which will determine whether his ruling, issued in
December, should apply to a broad class of affected taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   There is no reason to spend time and energy arguing over which
taxpayers the decision should cover if a higher court invalidates it,
the judge said. "I don't want to inflict that on anybody," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Luskin, with the Washington law firm Patton Boggs, promised to
tell the judge within a week whether Guillory will appeal, which he
has been considering since January. Appealing the case would freeze
it at the Superior Court level until the appellate court either
upholds or overturns Watson's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Guillory has said he's inclined to wait to appeal the entire case
until after Watson rules on the class-action issue.</TE>
<TE>   "If the case is going to be appealed, we need the whole case
appealed so we can get all of the issues settled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If Watson's ruling is upheld, it would apply to every county in
the state. In Orange County, taxing agencies would have to refund
$285 million in excess property taxes paid from 1998 to 2001, Orange
County Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom estimated. Statewide,
the loss could go as high as $4 billion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Watson's December ruling--in which he found that some Orange
County property assessments violated Proposition 13, the landmark tax
reform measure passed by California voters in 1978--sent shock waves
throughout the state. The judge ruled that Guillory, following a
practice used statewide, illegally raised the assessed value of
attorney Robert Pool's Seal Beach home by more than the 2%-a-year
limit set by Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys defended the practice, used after properties have
dropped in value and had their assessments lowered. When the values
rebound, the new assessments routinely exceed the 2% limit, they
said--a method called recapturing.</TE>
<TE>   Guillory has two options in the controversial case. One is to file
what is called an extraordinary writ with the 4th District Court of
Appeal, asking justices to overrule Watson's decision so far, or wait
until Watson rules on whether to expand the case to class-action
status and then appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Watson's ruling was the first court test of the method anywhere in
California. "As your honor knows, your ruling is a novel one," Luskin
said Tuesday, noting that every county uses the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I see my ruling as a novel one because it's the only one," Watson
said. "No matter what I decided, it would have been novel."</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Board of Supervisors sided with the judge's
interpretation of Proposition 13 and denounced the recapturing
practice, but gave Guillory the authority to hire his own attorney to
pursue an appeal. The board also ordered Guillory, Treasurer-Tax
Collector John M.W. Moorlach and Sundstrom to notify taxpayers whose
property assessments increased more than 2% in the past four years
that they might be affected by Watson's ruling--notification that
county attorneys said Tuesday hasn't been done.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach, who originally was sued with Guillory and the county,
was brought back into the case Tuesday with Watson's approval.
Moorlach said he hasn't been able to notify taxpayers of the ruling's
impact because Guillory hasn't identified them.</TE>
<TE>   For the second time in a court hearing, Watson indicated Tuesday
that he may include any taxpayer who received an excessive
assessment, not merely those who appealed their tax bills. He said he
has heard anecdotally that some taxpayers were told by county
employees not to bother filing appeals--advice they trusted even
though it erroneously robbed them of their rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no evidence that it did [happen, but] it's possible
there's a real motive for people to say, 'You don't qualify,' just
lie to keep the number of claims down," Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said board members were told in January
that it would take about six weeks to prepare a list of taxpayers
whose assessments rose above 2% in a year for reasons other than
sales or new construction. The board expects those taxpayers to be
notified, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Guillory said Tuesday that by law, he cannot notify taxpayers
of potential refunds. Sundstrom said Guillory is preparing a list of
properties whose assessments rose more than 2% a year, and then
Sundstrom will determine the amount of taxes potentially overpaid.
Also, the law requires refund notifications to be sent to whoever
paid the tax, not necessarily the owner of record, Sundstrom said.
That's where Moorlach comes in, because his office must determine who
actually paid the bills.</TE>
<TE>   The process of identifying affected taxpayers could take months,
Sundstrom said, and cost the county as much as $2 million.</TE>

<HD>Nidia, 6, Was 'the Light of Our Lives'</HD>
<DH>Funeral: Family of one of two girls killed when a car
jumped a curb at an Anaheim school raises questions about accident
investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 people gathered in a Santa Ana church Tuesday to bid
farewell to Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6, one of two girls killed a week ago
when a car jumped a curb and plowed into them in front of an Anaheim
school.</LD>
<LD>   "She was the light of our lives, to her uncles, to her
grandparents, to her cousins," Nidia's father, Armando Curiel, 27,
said after the funeral services. "We will always remember her."</LD>
<LD>   But even as they mourned Nidia's death, Curiel, his family and
friends also raised questions about the pace of the investigation
into the actions of Maria Martinez Juarez, the 50-year-old Anaheim
woman whose car struck first-grader Nidia and second-grader Bianca
Perez, 7, at Centralia Elementary School on March 12.</LD>
<TE>   "Even if you kill an animal, there is a penalty," said Nidia's
grandfather, also named Armando Curiel, who came from Mexico for his
eldest grandchild's funeral. "[Juarez] is walking free like nothing
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police Tuesday ruled out mechanical failure as a cause of
the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Juarez has not been charged, and accident investigators will
forward their findings to the city attorney's office this week,
police said. Preliminary reports said Juarez may have accidentally
pressed the accelerator instead of the brakes.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday at La Iglesia de La Luz del Mundo, a Spanish-speaking
congregation to which the Curiels belong, relatives and friends
packed the church and remembered a happy, studious girl who died
three months short of her seventh birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Nidia's body lay in a small casket. She was dressed in a white
dress and purple shawl. A teddy bear rested at her side.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Sua Lugo, 24, sobbed uncontrollably and was comforted
several times by her mother, Silvia, and other relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Later at Santa Ana Cemetery, the girl's father clung to his crying
wife, rubbing his cheeks against her forehead and whispering soothing
words.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Nidia's 3-year-old brother, Samir, could be heard crying
in the arms of an uncle. The boy and his mother witnessed the
accident from just a few paces from where Nidia was hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine the pain," said Maria Gonzalez, 34, who also has
children at Centralia.</TE>
<TE>   "I hurt when I see my daughter cry. I can't imagine what she is
going through."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez and other parents of Centralia students said they fear
for their children's safety because of traffic and confusion over the
school's combination driveway-parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   But Centralia's principal, Cindy Chaffee, maintained that the
school is safe.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a freak accident," she said. "Even in the safest school,
there isn't anything that can be done about an out-of-control
driver."</TE>

bioterrorist agents such as anthrax.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas Moore, director of the county's Public Health laboratory,
had requested $144,760 for a molecular analyzer and a centrifuge.
Both were needed to upgrade the laboratory, he said.</LD>
<LD>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the national Centers for

<HD>Workers at Bingo Club Mistreated, Suit Claims</HD>
<DH>Labor: MALDEF alleges that charity operation avoids paying
employees a wage by calling them volunteers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A charitable bingo operation in Hawaiian Gardens is fraudulently
calling its workers volunteers to avoid paying them lawful wages,
according to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The filing by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund says the 24 workers listed in the suit, most of whom are
Latinos, are paid no wages and depend on tips they receive while
selling bingo cards at the Hawaiian Gardens Bingo Club.</LD>
<LD>   The club, owned by the Irving I. Moskowitz Foundation, may take in
as much as $50 million a year, according to the U.S. District Court
suit, which names the club and foundation as the principal
defendants.</LD>
<TE>   Some rabbis and peace activists have accused Moskowitz of using
profits from his clubs to finance hard-line charities in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, including the U.S. State Department, have accused him of
inciting violent Israeli-Palestinian confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, charity bingo operations can use only volunteer
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contends that the club's workers "are not volunteers in
any true sense of the word" because they work regular hours several
days a week, must sign in and out, are punished if they violate work
rules and must ask permission before they go to the bathroom or leave
the club.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Beryl Weiner, a club spokesman, said the workers "are,
absolutely, volunteers."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody forces them to show up, and nobody says that they can't
leave," Weiner said.</TE>
<TE>   "They like what they do. Some of them have been there for more
than 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Weiner said California law prohibits wages and salaries for
volunteer workers, "and the Moskowitz Foundation will not pay a
salary or wage in violation of the law."</TE>
<TE>   The filing was announced Tuesday at a downtown news conference
attended by state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   The suit asks for damages including unpaid wages and other
benefits, general damages for pain, suffering and mental anguish, and
punitive damages.</TE>

<HD>Valley Man Among 5 Bodies Found in Reservoir</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Divers late Tuesday recovered the body of a fifth person dumped in a
Calaveras County reservoir, and federal authorities said they were
examining possible links between a San Fernando Valley businessman
discovered there in October and four bodies found there this week.</LD>
<LD>   A fifth body was pulled from the deep, frigid waters of New
Melones Lake near Modesto on Tuesday night as authorities were
investigating the possibility that the slayings are linked to a Los
Angeles group of Russian immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   With the prospect that more victims could be discovered, FBI and
Sacramento law enforcement officials were keeping a tight lid on
evidence surrounding the case.</LD>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks real estate developer Meyer Muscatel, 58, was found
floating in the New Melones Reservoir, east of Sonora in the Sierra
Foothills, on Oct. 18, but authorities did not confirm his identity
or release a cause of death until this week.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Rossi, a spokesman for the FBI's Sacramento field office,
said Muscatel's wrists were bound and his head was covered in a
plastic bag when he was found.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents said the Calaveras County coroner's office told
them Muscatel was smothered.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on a tip from an FBI office investigating slayings possibly
linked to organized crime, divers from the Sacramento FBI office and
the sheriff's departments in Tuolumne and Calaveras counties searched
the lake last week with sonar equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Two bodies were found Sunday at a depth of 300 feet and a third
Monday about three miles away. Authorities have not identified those
victims.</TE>
<TE>   At around 7 p.m. Tuesday, divers recovered another body,
apparently that of a woman, Rossi said. The body was found at a depth
of about 220 feet.</TE>
<TE>   None of the bodies discovered since Sunday have been identified.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials, who would not elaborate on the slayings, said they
went public with their investigation only because residents in the
New Melones area feared a serial killer was on the loose.</TE>
<TE>   Muscatel, who owned Sherman Oaks-based Best Avnet, was last seen
the evening of Oct. 11.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, Rachel Muscatel, said he told her he had a meeting
with potential investors in a Malibu housing development, but he did
not identify them or say where they were meeting.</TE>
<TE>   That day, family members said, Muscatel had called his bank four
times and tried to withdraw money, saying he was in danger. He
couldn't get the money because of procedural restrictions, the family
said.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, his green 1992 Ford Explorer was found abandoned
at a Gelson's Market at Millbank Street and Sylmar Avenue in Sherman
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Muscatel expressed frustration that authorities took so
long to identify her father through fingerprints at the Department of
Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   ''They basically just told us, 'Your father was murdered,' and
then we find out the gory details of how,'' she said. ''We could have
had closure the week after it happened.''</TE>
<TE>   Muscatel said her father grew up in New York City and came to Los
Angeles after high school.</TE>
<TE>   After numerous business ventures he got into the housing
development business, rehabilitating homes damaged by the 1994
Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Although law enforcement sources said authorities are looking at
the possibility the slayings are linked, one official cautioned
against describing those responsible as members of some vast
organized crime ring.</TE>

<HD>Foundation to Fund 70 Small U.S. High Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California will get at least four new small high schools as part of a
$40-million project by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, it was
announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The foundation, aiming to increase high school and college
attendance nationwide, is donating the money to organizations that
will create or redesign 70 small high schools around the country. The
schools will be unusual in that students who attend them can earn
both a high school diploma and a college associate's degree or up to
two years of college credit.</LD>
<LD>   The National Council of La Raza, which is based in Washington,
D.C., received $7.2 million to create 14 small high schools, all of
which will operate under charters that confer a certain amount of
autonomy. Four are to be in California, at least two of them in the
Los Angeles area, said La Raza Deputy Vice President Lisa Navarrete.</LD>
<TE>   The schools are intended to enroll no more than 400 students, and
classes will have fewer than 20 students.</TE>
<TE>   "Small schools have been proven to provide a more rigorous
academic environment," said Joe Cerrell, director of public affairs
for the Gates foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Each group getting a grant focuses on serving either low-income or
minority communities.</TE>
<TE>   "The foundation wants to focus on the kids who fall through the
cracks in the system," said Dag Vega, a spokesperson for the Gates
foundation. "They're mostly focusing on the kids that fall behind,
the kids that drop out because the classes aren't interesting."</TE>
<TE>   La Raza is a Latino civil rights organization that in the last two
years has been working to build more charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   "If [students] go to regular high school, a lot of the time it
does not prepare them for college. And they end up dropping out of
college," Navarrete said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of community involvement in charter schools, she said, she
finds them "most promising for Latino students. Educators, community,
parents--if there's a commitment to help children to learn from all
of these groups, it almost ensures that children will learn."</TE>
<TE>   Other organizations that received grants from the Microsoft
founder and his wife are Jobs for the Future, Middle College High
School Consortium, Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation,
Antioch University Seattle, KnowledgeWorks Foundation, SECME Inc. and
Utah Partnership Foundation.</TE>

<HD>Dog Mauling Case Is Sent to the Jury</HD>
<DH>Courts: Deliberations begin in the death of Bay Area woman.
A chastised defense attorney complains that the judge favors the
prosecution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After four weeks of gruesome and emotional testimony, jurors on
Tuesday began weighing the fate of two San Francisco lawyers charged
in the dog-mauling death of a neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   The jury started deliberations shortly after a Superior Court
judge threatened to jail a defense lawyer for making an improper
objection during the prosecution's closing argument rebuttal.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Nedra Ruiz had objected when the prosecutor said
one of the two dogs that killed 33-year-old Diane Whipple was not
leashed.</LD>
<TE>   Judge James Warren sternly ordered Ruiz to sit down.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not get up again or your next objection will be made from the
holding cell behind you," Warren said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz sat down and remained quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Ruiz said the judge favored the prosecution
and that he caved in to political pressure from San Francisco's gay
and lesbian community.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, a lacrosse coach, died on Jan. 26, 2001, after she was
attacked by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway outside her
apartment, which she shared with partner Sharon Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs' owners, Marjorie Knoller and husband Robert Noel, were
charged with involuntary manslaughter and owning a mischievous dog.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller is also charged with second-degree murder and could face a
sentence of 15 years to life in state prison. Noel faces a four-year
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved to Los Angeles County Superior Court because
of publicity in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors presented 40 witnesses and argued that Whipple died
because the defendants arrogantly ignored warnings about their dogs'
dangerous nature.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys presented 28 witnesses and argued that their
clients were conscientious dog owners who could never have
anticipated that their dogs would kill someone.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-man, five-woman jury has been partially sequestered,
eating catered lunches in a private room and being guided into the
building through a back entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The panel began deliberations at 10:20 a.m. Tuesday and went home
for the day at 4:30 p.m. Deliberations will resume today.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors are diverse in age and race and come from varied
educational and professional backgrounds. They include a part-time
actor, a custodian, a civil engineer, a bank manager and a machinist.
They live throughout Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   A review of jury questionnaires shows that 10 of them have owned
dogs, ranging from Labradors to terriers to golden retrievers. Six
jurors said they had either been snapped at or bitten by dogs. One
wrote that he thought the media exaggerates the dangers of pit bulls,
Rottweilers and Dobermans.</TE>
<TE>   One juror, a Philadelphia native who works for child support
services of Los Angeles County, wrote in his questionnaire that he
has owned a dozen dogs, most rescued from the pound, and that he was
partial to mixed breeds. He said he returned one dog to the pound
because it nipped at people's heels.</TE>
<TE>   Another juror, an unemployed casting coordinator, said he once
owned two Labradors. His younger brother was once bitten by a German
shepherd, he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A Federal Express courier from Los Angeles said he was on the job
once when a dog bit him on the arm. As a child, he wrote, he also
owned two mixed-breed dogs, one of which often growled.</TE>
<TE>   A production assistant from Alhambra said she is fond of all dogs
and that her sister belongs to an animal rescue group. "Animals are
important and need us to protect them," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A part-time actor wrote that she has owned both Rottweilers and
bulldogs and that she had bred dogs in the past.</TE>
<TE>   A machinist who works for the city of Los Angeles said he has
owned terriers and mixed breeds, and was once bitten while canvassing
for politicians. He wrote that sometimes his dog barks at people but
never bites.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Varinsky, a jury consultant hired by prosecutors, said he
was particularly interested in how jurors answered these questions:
When you walk your dog in the city, do you leash it? Have you ever
owned a dog that was overly aggressive or vicious? What actions
do/did you take to protect other dogs or people from your dog?</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted responsible pet owners," Varinsky said. "More
importantly, we didn't want people who had pit bulls and Rottweilers
only and weren't responsible with them."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said they wanted jurors who had not been
seriously bitten by dogs because they might still harbor some anger
toward dogs or dog owners.</TE>
<TE>   "There is also too much identification with the victim," said jury
consultant Karen Fleming, hired by Noel's defense attorney. "It is
very easy to think, 'Well, that could have been me.'"</TE>

<HD>Distributor of Chemicals Used in Meth Gets Life</HD>
<DH>Drugs: In a widely watched case, Las Vegas man is sentenced
for supplying ingredients used by others to manufacture 'speed' for
sale in Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the conclusion of a pioneering California drug case, a Las Vegas
man has been sentenced to life in prison for possessing the
ingredients for making methamphetamine--without any evidence that he
had actually cooked the drug.</LD>
<LD>   The case of Jessie Rodriguez Barron, 49, has long been viewed as
significant by authorities attempting to stifle the proliferation of
methamphetamine, particularly in inland regions of Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   When Barron was indicted in June 1994, law enforcement officers
were still struggling with a maddening facet of their fight against
"speed": Its ingredients, taken alone and used under different
circumstances, are legal. Pseudoephedrine, for instance, a primary
ingredient, is a decongestant; hydriodic acid has a variety of
industrial uses, such as cleaning metal.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities alleged that in the early 1990s, Barron was a key
player in a group that sold more than 40,000 gallons of hydriodic
acid to methamphetamine "cooks." According to Assistant U.S. Atty.
Michael J. Stern, there was no evidence that Barron himself had
manufactured methamphetamine, but the chemicals he bought and sold
were used to make batches of meth sold throughout the Inland Empire
and the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office filed charges that were viewed as
unusual by the law enforcement community. Until then, Stern said, few
people who had been caught with the ingredients of meth in
California--but didn't produce it--had been charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Barron was believed the first in California to be charged in
federal court under the legal theory that his sales of a "precursor
chemical" constituted a conspiracy to assist in the production of
methamphetamine, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   Barron fled to Las Vegas after he was indicted and lived there
until his arrest last year, authorities said Tuesday. Because of the
delay in his case, many others have since been charged, convicted and
sentenced under the same legal theory.</TE>
<TE>   The case is still seen as a significant one in the battle against
methamphetamine, Stern said. It ended late Monday when U.S. District
Judge Dickran Tevrezian sentenced Barron to life in prison without
the possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, until this case, people were not getting indicted when
they were distributing the chemicals," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were supporting the manufacture of meth. But it was only the
people who were manufacturing the meth who were being charged."</TE>
<TE>   Proving in court that someone not only possessed the chemicals but
knew what they would be used for remains a challenge, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing wrong with simply having a gallon drum of
hydriodic acid," he said. "It becomes more of a hurdle to show that,
not only did they possess this stuff but show that they were acting
in conjunction with people who were intending to make the drugs."</TE>
<TE>   The case marked the beginning of a trend in the fight against
meth, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick Fitzgerald, the
methamphetamine coordinator for the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, two years after Barron was indicted, drug agents and
prosecutors refined their strategy, moving to aggressively target
chemical suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   "Since then, there has been a sea change in the extent to which
the chemical suppliers are indicted and investigated and prosecuted,"
Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   Barron's defense attorney could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment against Barron, filed in U.S. District
Court, Barron and several other people, including his brother,
created two front companies to purchase hydriodic acid in the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   To persuade chemical wholesalers to sell him the acid, Barron went
through an exhaustive process to fraudulently transfer ownership of
several defunct gold mines in the Mojave Desert to himself. He then
claimed to the chemical wholesalers that he planned to use the
hydriodic acid in mining operations.</TE>
<TE>   Barron also used the phony companies to launder more than $1
million in illicit proceeds through various banks in the Los Angeles
area, Stern said.</TE>

<HD>Views Emerge in Rift Between Nixon Sisters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER, JOHN J. GOLDMAN and PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her first public comments about the legal feud with her sister,
Julie Nixon Eisenhower said she was distressed about the dispute but
said she is acting in the best interests of her father's library.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very heartbreaking because I love my sister very much,"
Eisenhower told about 1,000 people Monday night at a speaking
engagement in Redondo Beach. "I've had a terrible weekend, but I am
here."</LD>
<LD>   The rift between Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, the
once-tightknit sisters who caught the nation's attention during the
Nixon White House years, was revealed in a pair of lawsuits the Nixon
Foundation recently filed to collect a bequest from the late Bebe
Rebozo, a longtime friend of the former president.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Cox's attorney accused library officials of dividing
the sisters in an effort to gain access to Rebozo's bequest.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been heartbreaking for Tricia that the library has
sought to drive a wedge between the sisters by commencing litigation
based on false allegations and then trying the case in the press,"
said Richard Grabowski, an Orange County lawyer representing Cox.</TE>
<TE>   "It is fair to say what the library is trying to accomplish
through this litigation is trying to overturn the explicit wishes of
Mr. Rebozo."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over the bequest, which is estimated to be worth as
much as $20 million, is rooted in a deep philosophical divide over
who is best suited to preserve the Nixon legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower, 53, wants the foundation board to control the money.
Cox, 56, adamantly disagrees, saying Rebozo wanted his gift in the
hands of the Nixon family.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower on Monday spoke briefly with her older sister, saying
she was crushed that the disagreement spilled into court. But
Eisenhower said the foundation needed to take legal action to ensure
that it retains control over the bequest.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want," she said, is for the money to be spent on the
library. Her comments came four days after the sisters' legal battle
became public.</TE>
<TE>   But friends and library officials said the feud has been going on
since the mid-1990s. Several sources close to the sisters said they
have barely spoken for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo, who made millions in Florida real estate and other
ventures, left 65% of his estate to the Richard Nixon Library &amp;
Birthplace under the caveat that all expenditures be approved by
Nixon's daughters and another longtime Nixon friend, Robert
Abplanalp.</TE>

<LD>A woman was fatally injured late Monday when the pickup in which she
was riding was hit by a big-rig truck, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Carol Lee, 52, was in a Ford Ranger driven by her husband, David
Lee, police said. They were traveling north on the Orange Freeway
just south of Yorba Linda Boulevard when David Lee suddenly slowed to
pull over and secure the cargo, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   The big rig's driver braked but hit the pickup at about 55 mph,
California Highway Patrol officials said. Carol Lee apparently was
not wearing a seat belt, they said.</LD>

<HD>Focus Shifts to Expansion of Ontario Airport</HD>
<DH>Travel: L.A. board hires a consultant to examine long-range
strategy for relieving the growing passenger load at LAX.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city airport administrators hired a consultant Tuesday to
develop a long-range plan for the expansion of Ontario International
Airport, to accommodate some of Southern California's increasing air
transportation needs.</LD>
<LD>   The growth of the airport has become increasingly important since
the March 5 election, when Orange County voters rejected construction
of an international airport at the former El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station, airport officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Los Angeles City Airport Commission unanimously
approved the hiring of the consultant, saying other regional airports
must pick up some of the 30 million or so passengers a year that
planners had hoped would be able to use the now-rejected south Orange
County facility by 2025.</LD>
<TE>   The seven-member commission operates Ontario and three other
airports. With its vote, the panel hired Kansas City-based HNTB Corp.
to make plans for expanding Ontario International.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has extensive experience designing airport and
transportation projects. It has also been a financial backer of Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and of Hahn's campaign against San
Fernando Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   In December, HNTB gave $25,000 to L.A. United, the mayor's
anti-secession campaign committee. The company's local executives
also contributed $24,950 to Hahn. They gave mayoral election rival
Antonio Villaraigosa $4,700 during last year's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   HNTB was chosen from a field of three bidders, which submitted
proposals last summer to start planning for the long-term expansion
of passenger terminals and facilities at the Ontario airport.</TE>
<TE>   The first stage of the work is expected to take a year and cost
$650,000. But airport officials said the contract could total $3.9
million when later phases of the project are included.</TE>
<TE>   After the commission approved the contract, Hahn said in a
statement that he is committed to moving forward with his campaign
promise "to develop a regional aviation program that will
redistribute Southern California's air traffic demand from Los
Angeles International to other regional airports."</TE>
<TE>   Despite this month's decision by 57.8% of Orange County voters to
oppose development of an international airport at El Toro, Hahn said
"all airports in the region must be prepared to take on a larger
share of passenger and cargo volume in the future in order to
preserve the economic benefits of tourism and trade in our region."</TE>
<TE>   With two new passenger terminals that opened in 1998, the Ontario
facility is handling more than 6 million passengers a year, even with
the drop in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino County airport already has plans to build a
third passenger terminal when air traffic reaches 10 million annual
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ritchie, deputy executive for long-term planning at Los
Angeles World Airports, said a new terminal would boost Ontario's
annual capacity from 10 million to 15 million passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The new master plan study will examine the impact of future
construction, including passenger and cargo facilities and a third
runway. Ritchie said the Southern California Assn. of Governments has
projected that Ontario may have to serve 30 million passengers a year
by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the master plan study is expected to lead to an
environmental impact report on the effects of expanding the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Commissioner Leland Wong, just back from a trip to China,
said expansion of Ontario is "even more important" to the Los Angeles
region after the anti-airport vote in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   A regional aviation plan called for El Toro to handle about 30
million passengers a year but voters passed a measure to rezone the
site as a park and nature preserve.</TE>

<HD>Man Ordered to Stand Trial in Santa Monica Pier Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An alleged gang member has been ordered to stand trial on charges
that include taking 15 people hostage at Santa Monica Pier and
wounding three police officers in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Oswaldo Amezcua, 26, along with co-defendant Joseph Flores, 31,
was also ordered to stand trial on murder charges in three killings
that led up to the all-night standoff.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said Flores and Amezcua killed three people in June
2000. On July 3, police tracked the two suspects to the Santa Monica
Pier and detained Flores, but Amezcua fled down the pier and
barricaded himself in the arcade, using tourists as shields,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   The hostage crisis ended after a five-hour siege early on July 4
when Amezcua surrendered and released his captives.</TE>
<TE>   Shackled and chained to their chairs during the four-day
preliminary hearing, the two men acted as their own attorneys, said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Darren Levine.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said his office may seek the death penalty in the case. He
said the defendants have shown no remorse and at times laughed at
witnesses during the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the three murder victims was a fellow gang member who
was shot 14 times as he answered the door at his home in Victorville,
Levine said. Next to die was George Flores--no relation to defendant
Joseph Flores--who was killed in a drive-by shooting in Baldwin Park
that left another person wounded. A few hours later, Levine said, the
two killed fellow gang member Luis Reyes.</TE>
<TE>   They are scheduled to be arraigned April 2.</TE>

<HD>A Day Fit for a Queen and King</HD>
<DH>Politics: Jordan's royal couple promote a tourism-oriented
TV special and an aid program for the poor during a star-studded
visit to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR and DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The king and queen of Jordan did Hollywood on Tuesday, and at first
blush it seemed the usual blend of glitz and foreign affairs, movie
stars and world poverty--a routine day of canapes and celebrity
children photos.</LD>
<LD>   But this latest visit to Los Angeles to promote Jordan and an aid
program seemed something of a public-relations role reversal.</LD>
<LD>   King Abdullah II, who is known more for his grasp of policy, found
himself commiserating with Sharon Stone over the difficulties of
getting their children into private school.</LD>
<TE>   And Her Majesty Queen Rania al Abdullah, who is often noted in the
press for her beauty and style, gave a sober speech that could have
been delivered at a United Nations conference.</TE>
<TE>   It was a study in contrasts, from the moment King Abdullah pushed
aside the weighty responsibilities of his monarchy and strode into
the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel for a lunch with reporters,
television executives, at least one high-powered talent agent and the
casually dressed Stone.</TE>
<TE>   In West Hollywood, at Morton's--where the post-Oscar Vanity Fair
party will be held Sunday--the young queen was sticking to the
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Up-by-the Bootstraps Program for the Poor</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a white suit, the 31-year-old Queen Rania soberly
unveiled the Global Endowment for the Poor, a fund-raising drive for
"micro-loans" to the poor in developing countries--an approach
increasingly used to help women become economically self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Steinem, Morgan Fairchild, and Eunice and Sargent Shriver
listened intently, along with a room filled with so many prominent
female directors, producers and screenwriters that one co-host
quipped that it seemed like a reunion of the defunct Hollywood
Women's Political Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Queen Rania tried to speak their language too.</TE>
<TE>   "This city feels like it's been part of my life since I saw my
first movie," she said. "Consider that one of the things that the
Taliban did when it wanted to cut people off from the world was to
ban movies. And one of the first things people did when they were
able was to open the cinemas again."</TE>
<TE>   News coverage of Queen Rania does not always focus extensively on
her philanthropy. She is used to being interviewed about what she's
wearing. One Washington Post article quoted a man saying the queen
"makes the words 'infrastructure' and 'outsourcing' sound sexy."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why Rania was so studiously serious as she talked
about the new abused-children's shelter in Jordan, the plans for a
government battered-women's shelter there, and the efforts to build
grass-roots support for the passage of laws to protect women from
"honor killings" carried out by male relatives who believe a woman
has shamed the family.</TE>
<TE>   Micro-loans, she said in a brief interview, are "an empowering
tool" for women in the developing world. Micro-lending programs offer
modest loans, as low as $100, to individuals rather than aiding
organizations or governments. Often the loans go to women, who can
use them to start small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   From Housewives to Businesswomen</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen in many traditional societies, where women are
supposed to stay in the home, they have become the breadwinners of
the family," Rania said. "It's a way to empower women economically
and socially."</TE>
<TE>   Alison Anders, an independent director of such films as
"Sugartown" and "Mi Vida Loca," took a break from the casting of a TV
pilot to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in poor women. I raised children with a lot of
help as a welfare mother," Anders said. "I'm interested in how women
survive and take care of their kids. I come from very impoverished
roots, and she's getting a hundred bucks from my family."</TE>
<TE>   For Anders, "Being from the holler of Kentucky, I loved the irony
of going to see the queen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just enormously grateful to people who know that fame and
power is a gift and use it to better the world," she said. "She's so
eloquent, and she really has a passion for what she's doing."</TE>
<TE>   World Events Overshadow TV Show</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, Abdullah was promoting an hourlong special that will
air worldwide on the Travel Channel and Discovery Network on April
29. Filmed last April, "Jordan: The Royal Tour" is an effort to
recover business lost since the escalating Mideast violence and Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism usually accounts for 12% of the country's gross domestic
product, but in less than two years, that figure has dipped 42%. In
the difficult-to-reach areas of the country, the drop-off is even
worse, according to Malia Asfour, director of Jordan's Tourism Board
in North America. Consider Petra, a United Nations World Heritage
Site that usually hosts about 2,500 visitors each month. Two months
ago, eight tourists visited.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jordan describes itself as the "Switzerland of the Middle
East," the country has been unable to reassure Americans that it is
both safe and beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   The charismatic, 40-year-old, motorcycle-riding Abdullah seemed
like a perfect solution. For the West, he is a great public-relations
front man. He speaks impeccable British English and is so fluent in
U.S. pop culture that he even had a walk-on as a medical student on
the second episode of "Voyager: Star Trek." He admitted Tuesday that
during his role as host of the TV travel special, he assumed the code
name "Austin" in honor of one of his favorite flicks, "Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery."</TE>
<TE>   But almost no one at the lunch asked about the travel show. As
with the appearance by the queen, glitz gave way to worldly concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Guests peppered the king with questions about the crisis in the
Middle East, Islamic militants and worldwide perceptions of the
United States and President Bush. His responses were off the record.</TE>
<TE>   Stone, seated next to him, chatted him up about her eating habits
after requesting vegetarian versions of the fish lunch. She also
showed Abdullah pictures of her toddler son and spoke about
spirituality.</TE>
<TE>   The king and his wife reunited for a meeting downtown. It was
unclear whether he told her about the gift from Discovery executives,
a mix of U.S. style and Middle Eastern monarchy: a black motorcycle
helmet and two black leather Harley Davidson jackets embroidered with
the Jordanian royal crest.</TE>

<HD>Board to Stop Spending on El Toro Upkeep</HD>
<DH>Land use: Supervisors plan to save millions by leaving
maintenance to the Navy. The county's decision on the property's
future is set for April 16.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They may not know what to do with El Toro, but a majority of Orange
County supervisors agreed Tuesday that they don't want to spend any
more money on the former Marine base now that voters have blocked
long-standing plans for an airport there.</LD>
<LD>   At least three supervisors told Gary Simon, who heads the El Toro
planning office, to start negotiating with Navy officials to take
over maintenance and other costs at the 4,700-acre base. Doing so
would save the county an estimated $25 million through 2005,
Supervisor Todd Spitzer said.</LD>
<LD>   Voters this month approved Measure W, which rescinded airport
zoning passed in 1994 and rezoned the property for a park, open space
and limited development. Airport backers Monday sued the county,
attempting to stop enforcement of the initiative.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors said they expect to decide what to do with El Toro on
April 16, a week before the Navy has said it will announce its
decision on disposing of the base. The Navy has indicated that if it
gives up the property, it will be sold publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to see the county have to come up with additional
funds for upkeep on a base we may not be [taking]," Supervisor Jim
Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad said she wants to see a plan next
month on what would be needed to get the county out of the El Toro
planning business and to ensure that the county isn't responsible for
any environmental cleanup that might be required at the base, one of
the most polluted federal sites in the country.</TE>
<TE>   She also suggested that the county might take advantage of a Navy
sale by creating a trust fund either from sale proceeds or from
future budget savings to buy parkland for residents in North County,
who have far fewer parks than their southern counterparts. Spitzer
said the idea was good, but Silva opposed earmarking any savings for
parks.</TE>
<TE>   All five supervisors said they want to protect the base's current
tenants, who are leasing from the Navy through the county. They
include several agricultural leases for farming and a lease for
Western Heritage Assn. to operate the horse stables through 2005.
Supervisors had previously approved negotiating with Western Heritage
for the stable operation but didn't officially sign the lease until
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The county will ask the Navy to honor those leases through 2005
even if the county backs out of responsibility for any activities at
the base.</TE>
<TE>   Other uses approved by the county include a golf course, rental of
the officers club and recreational vehicle storage.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine and Lake Forest officials urged supervisors to let Irvine
annex the property directly from the Navy for development as a park
and other uses allowed by Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine, Lake Forest and other South County cities should have a
voice in what happens at El Toro, even if the county remains the
official conduit with the Navy, said Richard T. Dixon, a Lake Forest
councilman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's imperative that we don't allow [the Navy] to sell off the
base," Irvine Councilman Mike Ward said. He said the city wouldn't be
interested in annexing the property if it is sold off in pieces to
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said it's important that the county and South County
cities agree on how to move forward April 16 so they can present a
united front to the Navy. Only an agreement on what could happen to
the property without an airport will persuade the Navy to give the
county more time to plan El Toro's fate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we think we're going to have succinct answers on the 16th,
we're fooling ourselves," he said. "We have to at least let them know
we're diligently and collaboratively working on a plan."</TE>

<HD>Birds' Evasion of Mission Is a Tough Loss to Swallow</HD>
<DH>Return: San Juan church officials plan to woo creatures
back from malls, college.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mission bells rang as the swallows returned to San Juan
Capistrano's historic mission Tuesday morning, an annual ceremony
that overshadows a nagging problem.</LD>
<LD>   The swallows that once arrived in cloud-like flocks now just
trickle in.</LD>
<LD>   The migratory birds have been steering clear of the mission and
the ruins of the Great Stone Church for nearly a decade, favoring
freeway overpasses, shopping malls and--for reasons that are
unclear--a college technology building.</LD>
<TE>   Mission officials are hoping this is the last year the swallows
will turn up their beaks at the place that made them famous: the
200-year-old mission. By next season, more than 100 ceramic nests
will be hung in the rafters of the Great Stone Church while recorded
swallow calls will be played to help win back the tiny birds.</TE>
<TE>   "The hope is that a new generation will restart at the mission,"
said Bill Baker, a wildlife photographer in San Juan Capistrano who
has documented the birds for three years. The mission is following
the advice of Charles R. Brown, an associate professor of behavioral
ecology and ornithology at the University of Tulsa and a swallows
expert.</TE>
<TE>   The birds apparently have been turned off to the mission grounds
since earthquake retrofitting began at the church in the early 1990s,
a project that resulted in the bird's mud nests being destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   After spending a few days studying the situation, Brown decided
that the swallows just needed a reason to stop at the mission after
their 7,500-mile trek from Goya, Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   He encouraged mission officials to build hundreds of artificial
mud nests and play recorded swallow calls.</TE>
<TE>   "Come March of next year, they'll be calling swallows back to the
mission--and hopefully in big numbers," said Baker, who has worked
with Brown on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the faithful will have to be satisfied with the
occasional sighting. Tuesday's ceremonies began at 8:20 a.m. when
Mike Gastelum rang the bells after spotting a small cluster of
swallows winging above the church's bell towers.</TE>
<TE>   "There was only about six or seven of them," said Gastelum, who
replaced his grandfather, the mission's bell ringer for 42 years.
"Back in the early days, my grandfather used to see small clouds of
them fly over. He wouldn't ring the bell for just a few."</TE>
<TE>   Now there's evidence that the swallows prefer the high arches of
the Technology and Applied Science Building at Saddleback College in
Mission Viejo to the ruins of the old church.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there haven't been any sightings at the college. The
Swallows Day parade, which has been a tradition since the 1930s, will
take place Saturday. And then mission officials will turn their
attention back to the birds.</TE>

<HD>Key Vote Expected on L.A. Unified Political Districts</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The map chosen tonight by the commission redrawing Los Angeles Board
of Education districts is expected to have serious political
implications for the representation of the San Fernando Valley and
the reelection chances of incumbent board members.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Redistricting Commission for the Los Angeles Unified
School District will select one of two proposals and send it to the
City Council for approval.</LD>
<LD>   One map, drawn by an appointee of school board President Caprice
Young, keeps North Hollywood and Studio City within the confines of a
Valley district, but puts the southwest Valley into another district
along with West Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The other proposal, drawn by the California Latino Redistricting
Coalition and presented by an appointee of board member Julie
Korenstein, places North Hollywood and Studio City in the West L.A.
district, but puts the southwest Valley into a Valley-only seat.</TE>
<TE>   Each district represents 635,000 residents. The Valley, with a
population of 1.44 million, requires representation by the equivalent
of 2.2 board members.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Korenstein represents the East Valley and parts of the
central and West Valley. Young's district includes Studio City. The
competing maps would land either Korenstein or Young in a district
centered in the West Valley, which, with a majority of white voters,
could increase chances for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Korenstein nor Young said that representing the West
Valley was a factor in drawing the proposals. Young said her chances
of reelection would not necessarily improve with the map she favors,
because she would lose the vast majority of her current constituents.
With the map she supports, more neighborhoods, such as Boyle Heights
and Koreatown, as well as high school feeder zones, would remain
intact, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein said the Valley would be disenfranchised if its
southwest region, with such communities as Woodland Hills, were not
included in a Valley seat.</TE>

<LD>The map chosen tonight by the commission redrawing Los Angeles'
school district boundaries is expected to have serious political
implications for the representation of the San Fernando Valley and
the reelection chances of incumbent board members.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Redistricting Commission for the Los Angeles Unified
School District will select one of two proposals and send it to the
City Council for approval.</LD>
<LD>   One map, drawn by an appointee of school board President Caprice
Young, keeps North Hollywood and Studio City within the confines of a

along with West Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The other proposal, drawn by the California Latino Redistricting
Coalition and presented by an appointee of board member Julie
Korenstein, places North Hollywood and Studio City in the West L.A.
district, but puts the southwest Valley into a Valley-only seat.</TE>
<TE>   Each district represents 635,000 residents. The Valley, with a
population of 1.44 million, requires representation by the equivalent
of 2.2 board members.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Korenstein represents the East Valley and parts of the
central and West Valley. Young's district includes Studio City. The
competing maps would land either Korenstein or Young in a district
centered on the West Valley, which, with a majority of white voters,
could increase the board member's chances for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Korenstein nor Young said that representing the West
Valley was a factor in drawing the proposals. Young said her chances
of reelection would not necessarily improve with the map she favors,
because she would lose the vast majority of her current constituents.
With the map she supports, more neighborhoods, such as Boyle Heights
and Koreatown, as well as high school feeder zones, would remain
intact, she added.</TE>
<TE>   ''It keeps neighborhoods whole,'' she said. ''And that's the most
important thing.''</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein said the Valley would be disenfranchised if its
southwest region, with such communities as Woodland Hills, were not
included in a Valley seat. The current map, drawn a decade ago, has
four board members representing the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   ''The map I'm backing gives the San Fernando Valley back the
possibility of having two clear votes,'' Korenstein said. ''The other
map plays havoc with the Valley again.''</TE>
<TE>   Both maps would create a Latino stronghold in the East Valley, a
development seen as much needed in a school district in which 70% of
the students are Latino. The only question is whether Korenstein or
Young will represent it. Jose Huizar, who represents southeast Los
Angeles, is the only current Latino board member.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting last week, neither map received the eight votes
needed for approval. Each got seven votes on separate motions. Those
involved say the close vote could be a sign of how contentious the
issue may be, even after it reaches the City Council later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council must adopt new boundaries by June 30. The first
school board election using the new boundaries will be held in March
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Commission meetings have been attended by labor groups, supporters
of board members, and district residents.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Calanche of Boyle Heights, who worried that her community
would be divided, pleaded for the commission to support the map
favored by Young.</TE>
<TE>   ''All we have [in Boyle Heights] are our public schools,'' she
said. ''It's all the equity we have on the Eastside.''</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Gordon of Encino hopes Korenstein would continue to
represent her community; she wants the commission to vote for the
second option.</TE>
<TE>   ''It would be very hard to watch years of incredibly hard work go
down the drain,'' said Gordon, a member of a parent group at Lanai
Road Elementary School in Encino that has been supported by
Korenstein. ''To start a new relationship sounds very daunting.''</TE>
<TE>   Groups with vested interests of maintaining favorable board
members have also joined the debate. Earlier this week, United
Teachers-Los Angeles distributed fliers that accuse Young of using
''lackeys'' in hopes of packing the school board with ''cronies.''</TE>
<TE>   The union, which has a strong relationship with Korenstein, said
Young is a challenge to teacher contracts and benefits and that the
commission should vote against the map Young favors.</TE>
<TE>   Young, who denounced the fliers, said the commission's choice
should be based on keeping neighborhood schools together.</TE>
<TE>   ''Ideally, the school board should be focused on the kids and
education, but there are so many special interests that it gets
pulled off to adult agendas,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is emblematic of the different agendas being played
out over the fate of the districts. There is concern that a district
with more than 900,000 students is too large to be governed by seven
board members.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's no question that both maps have lobbyists,'' said board
member David Tokofsky. ''There are e-mail wars and all sorts of stuff
going on. The most important thing causing this is that the board
member districts are too large.''</TE>
<TE>   Every 10 years, the commission must redraw boundaries to take into
account the current racial makeup of communities and the population
of registered voters and high school feeder zones.</TE>

<DL>HOLLAND, Mich.

<LD>As factory jobs go, Stan Rewa always thought his was pretty neat.
The work is steady and the pay good, and there's the added satisfaction
of producing something special, a piece of Americana that has
delighted--and hushed--generations of rambunctious kids.</LD>
<LD>   Rewa doesn't make electric trains. Or yo-yos. He makes Life Savers.</LD>
<LD>   "We are a part of America," said Rewa, who cooks and flavors the candy
at the Life Savers factory here. "I don't know anybody who didn't grow up
eating them, to see if you could get a whole roll in your mouth."</LD>
<TE>   The memories will endure, but the factory that turns out 46 billion
Life Savers each year won't. Kraft Foods Inc. is closing the plant and
moving its operations to Canada, where sugar is half the price and its
work force will be nonunion. The move will wipe out 600 union jobs that
pay an average of $15.50 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   For 35 years, the Life Savers plant was a symbol of stability and
financial security for 115,000 residents living in and around this
western Michigan town. Layoffs at factories that make office furniture
and car interiors are cyclical in this region. But a job at Life Savers
was considered a job for life. Employees lobbied to get their relatives
hired, and many families drew two or more Life Savers paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   Brad and Brenda Morris and their extended family have put in a
collective 105 years there. "A lot of our lives went into Life Savers,"
said Brenda Morris, 38, who earns $16 an hour at a spinning machine that
forms the candy rings.</TE>
<TE>   "When we got hired there, we thought we were going to retire from
there," said Morris, whose 56-year-old mother also works at the plant.</TE>
<TE>   To city officials like Mayor Al McGeehan, the closing is a painful
lesson in international economics--the story of an all-American city that
tried to put out the welcome mat to business, got whipsawed by forces
beyond its control and lost a major taxpayer and civic symbol.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an icon. I can't find a better word to describe it," said
McGeehan. "That traditional candy, with a hole in the middle--every one
of them for the last 35 years has come from Holland, Mich."</TE>
<TE>   The treats were invented in 1912 by Cleveland candy-maker Clarence
Crane. Eager to find a sweet that wouldn't melt during summer, he asked a
pill maker to produce round, flat mints with a hole in the middle. Crane
named them for the life preservers that ships began stocking after that
year's Titanic disaster. His slogan: "For that Stormy Breath."</TE>
<TE>   Crane sold the franchise, and Life Savers evolved. Hard-candy fruit
rings were introduced in 1929. The popular five-flavor pack--lemon, lime,
orange, pineapple and cherry--debuted in 1935. During World War II, about
23 million boxes of Life Savers were packed into military field rations,
allowing G.I.s to introduce the candy to foreign lands.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, flavors were added and dropped. Of the current 33
flavors, cherry is the most popular, lemon the least. But the most
intriguing is Wint-o-green, which emits flashes of light when smashed or
bitten vigorously in the dark. The reason: The oil of wintergreen
flavoring turns ultraviolet light from crunched nitrogen molecules into
blue sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there are Gummi Life Savers, sugar-free Life Savers and Life
Savers fruit slices. They're made in Chattanooga, Tenn.; Oklahoma City;
and Des Plaines, Ill., respectively.</TE>
<TE>200 Million Rolls a Year</TE>
<TE>   But for more than three decades, all of the traditional hard-candy
Life Savers sold in the United States have originated here, 170 miles
west of Detroit in a community founded 250 years ago by Dutch Protestants
and now known for its annual tulip festival. The Holland plant belches
steam under a giant replica of a Life Saver that turns the colors of the
original fruit flavors at night. It produces 200 million rolls a year.
Laid end to end, they would stretch from Los Angeles to New York nearly
10 times over.</TE>
<TE>   Hired out of high school, Stan and Sallie Rewa fell in love working
side-by-side in the lollipop division. Sallie, 38, stayed through the
birth of two kids. Stan, 42, found fishing and hunting buddies at work.
The Rewas also hoped to retire from the mechanized candy-land.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Rewa's job inspired a certain pride, especially when someone
unwrapped a Life Savers lollipop.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see someone eating one, you know you made it," said Rewa,
who earns $16.43 an hour. "It is a pretty good feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere at work began to change a few years ago under former
owner Nabisco Holdings Corp. The bosses convened labor-management
meetings to talk about cutting costs and waste. Before Nabisco could sell
to Kraft Foods, federal antitrust regulators required the divestiture of
the Bubble Yum and Life Savers breath mints. They were afraid Kraft,
which owns Altoids, might corner the "intense mint market," said a Kraft
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>City Hall Helps Out</TE>
<TE>   That led to 180 layoffs. Part of the plant was left idle. When Kraft
took over in December 2000, it laid off a dozen more employees, then set
a goal of reducing production costs from $1.28 per pound to about 95
cents over the next several years. The current rate is $1.18, right on
target, say union officials.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, local plant executives asked Holland City Hall to help cut
an additional $2 million in expenses. The municipal utility offered an
annual $200,000 reduction in electric rates. Economic development
officials found $1.8 million in savings with a plan to have Life Savers
buy liquid sugar from a Michigan mill, rather than ship it by rail from
North Dakota and Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pleased with ourselves and the responses we were getting from
the company were positive--until we received 'The Fax,' " said Chris
Byrnes, president of the Holland Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 7, Kraft's corporate headquarters sent out a news release
announcing the closing. The same day, workers were called to a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty bummed out about it," said Sallie Rewa. "I mean, nobody
wants to have to work forever but it's a good place to work. We've got a
lot of good friends down there and we're going to miss that. Not to
mention the pay and benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Northfield, Ill.-based food conglomerate say
cost-cutting didn't make up for the fact the plant was "significantly
underutilized." They also said it made economic sense to consolidate Life
Savers production in a facility in Mount Royal, Canada, on the outskirts
of Montreal. Lower labor costs, they said, were not the "driving factor"
behind the move.</TE>
<TE>   John Boyd, president of a Princeton, N.J., consulting firm that helps
companies select plant locations, said payroll savings are a
"fundamental" reason that companies like Kraft move production abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd said a recent survey by his firm indicates Life Savers will pay
nonunion workers in Mount Royal about $12.50 an hour--$3 less than their
counterparts in Holland. With the Canadian government picking up the tab
for health coverage, the savings come to about $6.5 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Labor costs dominate the equation," Boyd said. "They account for at
least 70% of all operating costs. . . . That's the real driver in the
site selection process."</TE>
<TE>   Workers and city officials remain convinced that the culprit is sugar.
They blame the closing on a combination of federal tariffs, trade quotas
and loans that benefit U.S. sugar beet and sugar cane farmers by keeping
the price of domestic bulk sugar at 21 cents a pound, compared to 6 cents
on the international market. That makes a big difference to Life Savers,
which uses 113 tons of sugar a day. Each Life Savers candy is 95% sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Brachs candy cited high domestic sugar prices in announcing
that it would close its 77-year-old west Chicago plant and move 1,100
jobs overseas, one of several candy-makers to do so. Kraft isn't saying
how much it will save on the crucial ingredient. State and local
officials estimate it will be $6 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Davis, an international representative for the Retail, Wholesale
and Department Store Union said that fact, combined with other savings on
materials like cardboard, meant there was nothing the union could do.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have gone to the table and agreed to work for nothing and
they still would have saved money by moving to Canada," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan Gov. John Engler wrote Kraft CEO Betsy Holden on Jan. 15,
offering to give the plant a $25.5-million tax break over 15 years. It
wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the Rewas and their colleagues voted to accept a
severance package that wasn't as generous as many had hoped. The Rewas
calculate they will each walk away with about $12,000, after taxes. The
lollipop division is closing March 28.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Rewa says he's nervously optimistic he'll get a job, even in
Holland's current down market, but hopes to avoid the swing shift so he
can watch his son play high school football.</TE>
<TE>   Sallie Rewa wants to remake herself into a medical office assistant,
but the thought of such a change in midlife has given her stress
headaches. And while she understands that corporate America has the right
to save money, she said it especially hurts in the case of Life Savers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that they started it in the United States and now they're
going to be gone from here," she said. "A lot of people say they're not
going to buy them anymore."</TE>
<TE>   'It's been an icon. I can't find a</TE>
<TE>   better word to describe it. That</TE>
<TE>   traditional candy, with a hole in the</TE>
<TE>   middle--every one of them for the last</TE>

<HD>Looks Like Bullish Year for Business Candidates</HD>
<DH>Politics: Amid an Enron scandal, a number of boardroom hopefuls are
running strong drives, as nine vie for governor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After last September's terrorist attacks, this was supposed to be
an election year when concern about public safety rewarded candidates
with political experience.</LD>
<LD>   But a surprising number of business executives and entrepreneurs are
challenging that assumption with strong campaigns for office, especially
in governors' races.</LD>
<LD>   Candidates with backgrounds in business but no elected experience are
seeking governorships in nine states--one-quarter of this year's
gubernatorial contests. The latest example occurred Tuesday as former
venture capitalist Mitt Romney, who headed the committee that ran the
Olympics in Salt Lake City, was effectively handed the Republican
gubernatorial nomination in Massachusetts when GOP acting Gov. Jane Swift
withdrew rather than face him.</LD>
<TE>   Two other businessmen-turned-candidates--Republican Bill Simon Jr. in
California and Democrat Tony Sanchez in Texas--have already won
gubernatorial primaries. Several others have established themselves as
favorites in their primary contests.</TE>
<TE>   This bull market in business candidates follows a trend that has
intensified the last two decades, one fueled partly by a public suspicion
of government that allowed wealthy executives to run as populist
outsiders. These candidates also touted their skills to fix broken
bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   The question for this year's crop of business contenders is whether
that advantage will survive an electoral environment reshaped both by
Sept. 11 and the Enron Corp. scandal. In both parties, many operatives
believe Enron has diminished the high standing business enjoyed during
the boom years of the 1990s--while Washington's response to the terrorist
attacks has restored at least some faith in government and elected
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even in this tougher climate, most of the business candidates are
running well.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, people respect somebody who is willing to put
their money where their mouth is and are doing something because they
think it is the right thing to do, not because they want to fulfill a
career," said Brian Sullivan, an entrepreneur seeking the Republican
gubernatorial nomination in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The success of these candidates is a testament not only to the
continuing political appeal of the business resume--especially in races
for executive-branch positions--but the practical advantage for
candidates who can fund their campaigns largely by reaching into their
own wallets. Business executives--like Sanchez or New York City Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg--have used their money to swamp opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "The rich candidates are not guaranteed a victory, but they have far
better odds than any other group of candidates you can pick, including
other elected officials," said University of Virginia political scientist
Larry J. Sabato. "Elected experience used to be the best guarantee of
victory at the next step. Now the best guarantee is having a ton of your
own money."</TE>
<TE>   For years, the two parties have intermittently recruited candidates
from business ranks. As early as 1940, the GOP chose political novice
Wendell L. Willkie, a charismatic utility executive, as its presidential
nominee against Franklin D. Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   By 1992, when businessman Ross Perot made a third-party presidential
bid, the parties were routinely courting businesspeople as candidates.
Currently, four members of the Senate are former businessmen who had not
held previous political office: Democrats Jon Corzine of New Jersey and
Herbert Kohl of Wisconsin, and Republicans Charles Hagel of Nebraska and
Robert F. Bennett of Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Six sitting governors fit that description: Republicans John Hoeven of
North Dakota, Gary Johnson of New Mexico, Mike Leavitt of Utah and Kenny
Guinn of Nevada, along with independent Angus King of Maine and Democrat
Mark Warner of Virginia. Business executives have also provided a steady
stream of mayors, such as Richard Riordan in Los Angeles and Bloomberg.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, business executives have had mixed success as politicians.
Some utterly flopped as candidates--such as Republican Clayton Williams
in Texas and Democrat Al Checchi in California, both of whom poured
millions into failed gubernatorial bids. Others have proved incapable of
adapting the autocratic style of the boardroom to the give-and-take of
the political cloakroom.</TE>
<TE>   Yet enough have done well to encourage a steady stream of successors.
And state parties often encourage the trend because they see wealthy
business nominees as a means of funding advertising and get-out-the-vote
campaigns that can benefit all their candidates.</TE>
<TE>   This year, each party has only one serious business candidate bidding
for a U.S. Senate seat: Republican Doug Forrester in New Jersey and
Democrat Erskine Bowles in North Carolina, a White House chief of staff
for President Clinton who comes with as many political as management
credentials.</TE>
<TE>   But besides Simon, Sanchez, Sullivan and Romney, three Republicans and
two Democrats with business pedigrees are considered serious contenders
in gubernatorial races. The GOP candidates are running in Alabama, New
Hampshire and Rhode Island; the Democrats in Colorado and Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Even across party lines, these candidates are employing similar
themes. Echoing Perot, they have portrayed their lack of government
experience as an advantage over opponents they invariably deride as
"career politicians."</TE>
<TE>   "As governor, he'll use his real-world experience to keep New
Hampshire strong," says an advertisement for Craig Benson, the founder of
an Internet equipment company who has emerged as the principal rival to
former Sen. Gordon Humphrey for the GOP gubernatorial nomination.</TE>
<TE>   With the economy still sluggish in many states, the business
candidates are also stressing their management experience creating jobs
in the private sector. "He's helped create over 70,000 jobs," declares an
ad for Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these candidates, in turn, can expect questions about their
business ethics. California Gov. Gray Davis has already promised an
assault against Simon over the failure of a savings and loan acquired by
the Republican's family.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the things that one does in business to succeed might draw
plaudits from the Harvard Business Review . . . but are pretty hard to
explain to the average voters," said Garry South, Davis' chief
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   More intriguingly, some are questioning whether the lack of political
experience is still an asset, post Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Mark Earley sought to make that case against Warner, a
venture capitalist, in last fall's Virginia gubernatorial race. But it
didn't work; Warner won easily.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe a business background looks more questionable in the wake
of the Enron bankruptcy, which has tarnished business' standing with many
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   A tight race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Minnesota
may be the contest that best crystallizes the contending arguments
between candidates from the business world and career politicians. That
race pits Sullivan, who made his fortune when he sold a water filter
company he founded shortly after college to Procter &amp; Gamble, and Tim
Pawlenty, the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   The race revolves around the contrast in their resumes. Sullivan's
central message has been that he's a "can-do" businessman who will apply
business tactics to the statehouse. "The approach of the entrepreneur is
exactly what is needed to get government to do a better job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pawlenty hasn't shied away from that fight.</TE>
<TE>   To an unusual degree for a Republican, Pawlenty has gibed Sullivan
over his wealth, suggesting that he'll put off blue-collar voters in a
general election. And Pawlenty is challenging Sullivan's lack of
political experience, which Pawlenty argues is less attractive in
Minnesota after the tumultuous term of independent Jesse Ventura (who has
yet to announce whether he will seek reelection).</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for experience, especially after Jesse and Sept.
11," says Tim Commers, Pawlenty's campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, Sullivan's outsider appeal and his bigger megaphone appear
to be trumping Pawlenty's experience. Boosted by a self-financed
advertising and direct-mail blitz that dwarfed Pawlenty's efforts,
Sullivan seized the lead at the start of the process for selecting
delegates who will pick the nominee at a convention in June.</TE>
<TE>   If Sullivan sustains his advantage, he will continue what is shaping
up as a boom year for candidates crossing from business to politics.</TE>

<HD>Fed Signals Policy Shift Is in Works</HD>
<DH>Economy: As it edges toward rate hike, panel drops the recession
warning and says excessive growth may hurt the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Moving to manage a reviving American economy, Federal Reserve
policymakers Tuesday took a first step toward raising interest rates,
dropping their position that a recession is the nation's biggest economic
danger.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the central bankers left their key interest rate at a
four-decade low of 1.75%. But they accompanied their decision with word
that they believe the risks are no longer tilted toward recession, but
instead are balanced with the danger of excessive growth.</LD>
<LD>   That represented a huge change for the Fed, which slashed rates 11
times last year in an effort to keep the economy afloat. Tuesday's
announcement was widely interpreted as preparing borrowers and investors
for the possibility of rate hikes this year.</LD>
<TE>   "The recession is over, and it's time for the Fed to start thinking
about leaning in the other direction," said Los Angeles economist Donald
H. Straszheim.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks closed mixed on news of the Fed's decision with investors
fearful that central bank rate hikes could take some of the starch out of
the recovery. But the bellwether Dow Jones industrial average managed to
close at a nine-month high.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow rose 57.50 points, or 0.5%, to close at 10,635.25, its highest
close since June 21. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 4.74, or
0.4%, to 1,170.29. The Nasdaq composite index was up 3.81, or 0.2%, to
1,880.87.</TE>
<TE>   Some borrowing costs appear to have risen in anticipation of future
Fed rate hikes. The yield, or market interest rate, on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note, to which many home mortgages are tied, has climbed
more than a quarter point since March 7 when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
told Congress a recovery is underway.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's decision to change its policy from one that favored further
rate cuts to a neutral stance signals an end to one of the most
aggressive periods of rate cuts in the central bank's history. Beginning
with an unusual, inter-meeting rate cut Jan. 3 of last year, policymakers
slashed the funds rate from 6.5% to 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   But in a surprise, Fed policymakers seemed to back away from some of
Greenspan's most optimistic language about the economy, even as they
agreed it is on the mend. Analysts said the difference in tone
illustrates the tough task that lies ahead for the central bank in
gauging the extent of recovery and tailoring policy to it.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, headed by Greenspan,
agreed that the economy "is expanding at a significant pace." But they
attributed most of the improvement to the one-time pop of companies
replenishing inventories.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, the committee said, "the degree of the strengthening
in final demand over the coming quarters, an essential element in
sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   That assessment seemed to significantly differ from the picture
Greenspan painted in Senate testimony. "The recent evidence increasingly
suggests that an economic expansion is already well underway," he told
lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting whipsawed by the Fed. I think they're a little confused
about what they ought to be doing," said Dominic Konstam, head of
interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In a nutshell, said Konstam and others, the Fed's dilemma is that it
wants to help the economy come back in a balanced fashion with deeply
depressed corporate investment reviving to match still-buoyant consumer
spending and a stock market that seems ready to takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   It might be able to do so by raising interest rates a little, which
some analysts said would encourage consumers to save more and help
convince firms that growth would be sustained and they should go back to
investing.</TE>
<TE>   But if the central bank acted, it would do so without the usual excuse
that it was controlling inflation, which has been tame. And policymakers
would risk strengthening a strong dollar, which has made a hash of U.S.
exports.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some analysts said trade figures issued Tuesday, which showed
an unexpected deterioration in exports and a widening trade gap, will
discourage the Fed from acting quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The absence of a convincing export recovery will help convince the
Fed that an early [interest rate] tightening would be ill-advised," said
Maury Harris, chief economist with UBS Warburg in New York.</TE>
<TE>   If growth continues, however, analysts said the central bank
eventually will have to act. "The Fed is trying to walk a fine line, but
they are going to have to normalize rates," said Diane C. Swonk, chief
economist with Bank One Corp. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   At 1.75%, the Fed-controlled federal funds rate is at its lowest level
since 1961. Swonk and others said that given the economy's state, a
"normal" rate, which would neither speed up nor slow down growth, would
be between 3% and 4%.</TE>
<TE>   The economy's revival has caught economists and Fed officials by
surprise. The gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods
and services, grew at an unexpected 1.4% annual rate in the final three
months of last year. Manufacturing expanded in January and February for
the first time in a year and a half. American employers added 66,000
workers in February, the first expansion of payrolls since July.</TE>

<HD>HP Declares Slim Victory in Merger Vote</HD>
<DH>Tech: It could be weeks before results of the vote on the Compaq
deal are official. HP supporters see a win as critical to firm's role as
bellwether for the industry.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CUPERTINO, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>One of the nastiest corporate battles drew to a close Tuesday as
Hewlett-Packard Co. proclaimed victory in its $20-billion bid to take
over Compaq Computer Corp. and create the world's largest maker of
personal computers.</LD>
<LD>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina claimed a preliminary win in the
dramatic proxy fight by a "slim but sufficient margin," after a special
shareholders meeting. The lead critic of the deal, company director
Walter Hewlett, on Tuesday refused to concede defeat, saying the margin
was less than 2%.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition would create a Palo Alto-based behemoth with $82
billion in annual sales, 145,000 employees and the largest market share
in personal computers, most types of large business computers and
printers. It would be the second-largest company headquartered in
California, after San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco Corp., itself created
in a merger last year.</LD>
<TE>   The merger is critical to HP's role as one of the leading technology
companies in the world and a bellwether for the industry, according to
supporters. At a time when technology companies are struggling to regain
the momentum they enjoyed during the boom of the late-1990s, Fiorina
wants the historic innovator to grow in preparation for a technology
resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   It could be weeks before official results are announced because
shareholders could cast multiple ballots. Only the last ballot counted,
and some observers called Fiorina's victory announcement premature.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how it was when CBS said, 'We're going to call Florida for
Gore,' and they were wrong?" said Mark Specker, managing director of
SoundView Technologies Group. "Well, she's probably got a little higher
level of prevision than that, but she may not completely know."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's contentious meeting capped a four-month campaign in which HP
and Hewlett tried to woo shareholders with a multimillion-dollar blitz of
newspaper ads, mailings and telemarketing calls. The battle pitted
Fiorina, the highest-ranking female executive in the Fortune 500, against
Hewlett, a mild-mannered engineer and son of HP founder Bill Hewlett.</TE>
<TE>   Because large institutional shareholders were split on the merger,
individual investors played a larger role than usual in deciding the fate
of two companies. Fiorina, a marketing executive brought to HP three
years ago as the first outsider to lead the company, argued that an
alliance with Houston-based Compaq would give HP the natural advantage of
size and a diverse line of products--from printers and PCs to hand-held
organizers and powerful corporate servers.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett, however, claimed that HP would dilute its profitable
divisions with Compaq's struggling computer business. His opposition
alienated him from the board on which he has served for 15 years and
divided shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks after HP's announcement, Hewlett hinted that the odds
were now against what had been an unlikely insurgency from the start. "We
have proved that accountability to shareholders is not a platitude," he
said. "I will resume my normal life as an academic and musician."</TE>
<TE>   That line of Hewlett's remarks nevertheless played on a widely
criticized shareholder mailing from HP that first personalized the
contest between Fiorina and Hewlett, who initially supported the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The mailing, one of as many as nine received from the two sides by
even small investors, derided Hewlett as a "musician and academic"
without mentioning his software expertise or role as an active director
at multiple technology companies and nonprofits.</TE>
<TE>   As the war of words intensified, Hewlett said last week that if the
merger failed, Fiorina should go and be replaced by a CEO who wasn't
"learning on the job."</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina's track record became one of a number of issues in the debate
over Compaq that divided employees from employees and investors from
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina alienated some workers from the beginning. She pledged to
quicken the pace of the "HP Way," a celebrated culture that prized
consensus and technical elegance.</TE>
<TE>   As the technology boom turned bust and HP's profit and share price
followed, Fiorina angered some investors and Wall Street analysts with
missed projections.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, she was leading the board in a discussion of
alternatives as radical as spinning off the company's money-earning
printer division and shutting down the company's third-ranking computer
arm entirely, HP disclosed during the proxy fight.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing else was as radical as the solution she came up with: a
merger of near-equals that would add HP to Compaq, the 20-year-old PC
specialist that was losing market share to cross-Texas rival Dell
Computer Corp.</TE>
<TE>   When the deal was announced, HP shares fell as much as 20%, prompting
Hewlett, fellow founder's heir David W. Packard and others to call on HP
to reverse course, using their combined 18% stake in the company to form
the nucleus of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina won votes with personal visits, phone calls, and a convincing
argument that holders needed to look beyond the bad news in the
contracting personal computer industry.</TE>
<TE>   Although virtually every other technology merger of any size has been
considered a failure, Fiorina says the Compaq deal is different. It would
enable cost savings of a projected $2.5 billion a year through product
and job eliminations while simultaneously allowing HP to increase its
market share in multiple lines.</TE>
<TE>   HP clearly sweated over the details, devoting hundreds of workers to
full-time planning of how the consolidation would work.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, HP and Compaq employees from as far away as
France came to oppose the acquisition, largely for fear of losing their
jobs. One recently laid-off worker from Livermore banged a drum and wore
a green cape, the color of the proxy cards against the merger.</TE>
<TE>   But Fiorina warned that not all of the 15,000 layoffs contemplated by
the merger's planners would be avoided if shareholders rejected the deal.
"We have 36,000 people in money-losing businesses," she said. "Profit is
the foundation for everything we do."</TE>
<TE>   Several employees and retirees said Fiorina comes across as regal and
badly out of touch with what long-term HP workers thought was best. Many
of the 2,000 in attendance at the meeting in a Cupertino college
auditorium booed when Fiorina claimed majority employee support for the
Compaq deal.</TE>
<TE>   "The booing--that alone would show you that this is a very serious
problem," said HP shareholder John Wharton, a Silicon Valley consultant
and Intel Corp. veteran. "When the old management wanted to know what
employees wanted, they would ask them. This management commissioned a
survey," Wharton said.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina, in declaring apparent victory, said she hoped that the
divisiveness would end "once the ground has cooled."</TE>
<TE>   "Building a bridge begins today," she said. "To the Hewlett and
Packard families, I say that this company will always proudly bear your
name, and we will strive to be faithful stewards of the legacy of this
company."</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 45 cents to $18.80, while Compaq rose 78 cents to
$11.14, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq shareholders are expected to approve the deal at a meeting in
Houston today.</TE>

<HD>L.A. to Sue Over State Trash Regulation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying the goal is unrealistic, the Los Angeles City Council voted
Tuesday to file a lawsuit challenging a state rule that requires the
city to eventually keep all storm-drain trash from flowing into the
Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek.</LD>
<LD>   Under the Water Resources Control Board regulation, expected to go
into effect in three or four months, the city faces fines if it does
not reduce the amount of trash running into the river and creek by
10% annually, so that the waterways will be refuse-free in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   "That is impossible," said Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski. The
council voted 9 to 5 to file the Superior Court lawsuit seeking to
invalidate the rule. Under pressure from supporters of the
regulation, the council also set a hearing next week to debate the
issue.</LD>
<TE>   The city has estimated it would cost $700 million to install trash
screens on the drains. The screens would cut runoff pollution by 60%
in five years, but would not keep all trash out, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Wilson, director of Los Angeles' Bureau of Sanitation, said
the state rule would hold the city liable for trash that the wind
blows into the water. "We could be spending millions and millions of
dollars and miss the requirement by a decimal point and be subject to
enforcement action or a third-party lawsuit," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden said the rule "can't make the water
drinkable in 10 years, and if [it does], there will be no money left
to do anything else in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The regulation is now under routine review by the state Office of
Administrative Law. During its first two years, the 10% reduction
would not be enforced, while the state measures trash flows. Later,
violations would carry fines of as much as $27,500 per day.</TE>

<HD>Man Charged in Pursuit That Injured 2</HD>

<LD>A Van Nuys man was charged Tuesday with leaving an accident and
evading officers in connection with a police chase that ended with an
elderly couple being struck and seriously injured outside the Beverly
Center, according to the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Tremine Tillman, 23, of Van Nuys, is scheduled for arraignment
April 9. He is being held in County Jail on $250,000 bond.</LD>
<LD>   The injured couple, Anna Polivoda, 76, and her husband Henry, 79,
were taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Saturday after Tillman's
car struck them as they crossed the street near the mall.</LD>
<TE>   Anna Polivoda suffered a head injury, a broken leg and broken
thumb. Her husband suffered a broken leg and a severe concussion,
according to a family member.</TE>
<TE>   Their daughter, Stephany Yablow, said Tuesday that her parents,
both of whom survived the World War II Holocaust in Poland, are
expected to remain in the hospital for at least two weeks before
being transferred to a convalescent facility.</TE>
<TE>   Police have said officers initiated the pursuit near La Brea
Avenue and Washington Boulevard because the registration on the car
did not match the license plate sticker.</TE>
<TE>   Tillman crashed into several other vehicles during the chase
before hitting the Polivodas in the crosswalk at the intersection of
Beverly and La Cienega boulevards, police said.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Tillman could be sentenced to up to nine years in
prison.</TE>

<DH>Ethics: A La Canada Flintridge city councilwoman was fined
$2,000 for voting on a matter that her husband's law firm was
involved with.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>La Canada Flintridge City Councilwoman Deborah Orlik says she was
doing her job, voting on whether to settle a lawsuit against the city
concerning a controversial building project that had been a linchpin
issue in her campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The California Fair Political Practices Commission saw it
otherwise, ruling that her vote affected the business of her husband,
whose law firm represented one of the parties in the suit.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the commission called that vote a clear conflict of
interest and fined Orlik $2,000 for violating the Political Reform
Act.</LD>
<TE>   When Orlik was first elected to the City Council to serve out the
term of a deceased councilman, in 1998, the bedroom community at the
foot of the San Gabriel Mountains was hotly debating plans by
retailer Sport Chalet to build a massive corporate headquarters near
Angeles Crest Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Orlik, who described herself in campaign literature as a
"lawyer/publisher/ethicist," ran as an anti-development candidate and
won by two votes. (She was elected to a four-year term in 1999.) She
has said she did not know that her husband's firm represented Sport
Chalet until the April 1998 election.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1998, Orlik wrote to the commission asking for guidance on
how to handle potential conflicts of interest, concerned that
political opponents might try to hire her husband's firm to preclude
her from voting on certain hot-button issues.</TE>
<TE>   The commission responded a month later, telling Orlik, "You may
not participate in a governmental decision involving a client of your
husband's law firm if it is reasonably foreseeable that the decision
will have a material effect on your husband's law firm."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Orlik said that, based on the letter's
description of "economic interest," she decided that she did not have
to recuse herself from voting every time her husband's firm was
involved in an issue.</TE>
<TE>   She said she showed the letter to half a dozen lawyers, all of
whom agreed with her, reasoning that her husband did not stand to
significantly gain from the Sport Chalet project.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what practicing law is about," she said. "It's disagreeing
about the law. That's what happened here. The FPPC, myself and the
other handful of lawyers I spoke with disagreed."</TE>
<TE>   Gabrielle Pryor, La Canada Flintridge's former city manager, wrote
a letter to the FPPC on Jan. 22, 1999, alleging that Orlik was acting
improperly by participating in the debate on the project. After the
City Council approved the Sport Chalet project March 1, a group
called Friends of 91011 (the city's ZIP Code) filed suit against the
city and the Sport Chalet developer, which was represented by Cox,
Castle &amp; Nicholson, Randy Orlik's firm.</TE>
<TE>   In a closed-door meeting in April, the council discussed the
litigation and voted on a settlement offer. A month later, the
parties reached an agreement on the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Under the stipulation agreed upon by both Orlik and the FPPC, when
Orlik voted on whether to settle the lawsuit, she agreed that she
violated the section of the Political Reform Act that prohibits
public officials from using their official position to influence a
governmental decision in which they have a financial interest.</TE>
<TE>   Orlik said her decision to accept the fine was simply the price of
doing business. "I did what I needed to do," she said, "what the
people elected me to do. If it cost me 2,000 bucks, it's totally
worth it."</TE>

<HD>Garbage Rule Is Disputed</HD>
<DH>City Council: L.A. votes to sue over a new state regulation
that seeks to eliminate trash flowing into local waterways, a goal
seen as 'impossible.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying the goal is unrealistic, the Los Angeles City Council voted
Tuesday to file a lawsuit challenging a state rule that requires the
city to eventually keep all storm-drain trash from flowing into the
Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek.</LD>
<LD>   Under the Water Resources Control Board regulation, which goes
into effect later this year, the city faces fines if it does not
reduce the amount of trash running into the river and creek by 10%
annually, so that the waterways will be refuse-free in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   "That is impossible," said Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski. She
said she would support some sort of "zero trash" goal, but only if it
does not carry fines.</LD>
<TE>   The council voted 9 to 5 to file the Superior Court lawsuit
seeking to invalidate the rule. Under pressure from supporters of the
regulation, the council also set a hearing next week to debate the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   The city has estimated it would cost $700 million to install trash
screens on the drains. The screens would cut runoff pollution by 60%
in five years, but would not keep all trash out, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Wilson, director of Los Angeles' Bureau of Sanitation, said
the state rule would hold the city liable for trash that the wind
blows into the water or is dumped by homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   "We could be spending millions and millions of dollars and miss
the requirement by a decimal point and be subject to enforcement
action or a third-party lawsuit," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden said the rule "can't make the water
drinkable in 10 years, and if [it does], there will be no money left
to do anything else in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The regulation is now under routine review by the state Office of
Administrative Law. It is expected to take effect in three to four
months. During the first two years, the 10% reduction would not be
enforced, while the state measures trash flows. Later, violations
would carry fines of as much as $27,500 per day.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Dickerson, executive officer of the Los Angeles Regional
Water Quality Control Board, said the no-trash goal is "very
realistic."</TE>
<TE>   "Trash is one of the few items of pollution that is totally
behaviorally controlled," said Dickerson, whose panel recommended the
10-year goal to the state board.</TE>
<TE>   He said the city would only be held responsible for trash from the
storm drains. The notion that the city could be fined for an airborne
gum wrapper that lands in the river, he said, "is absurd."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica-based environmental group Heal the Bay also
embraced the rule. The organization noted that city litter ordinances
outlaw all trash dumping on streets and sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry voted against filing the lawsuit, saying
the city needs to be pushed to clean the river and creek.</TE>
<TE>   Also voting against the lawsuit were council members Eric
Garcetti, Janice Hahn, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Jack Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm a person out there right now listening to this, it sounds
like the city doesn't want to do this," Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the regulation allows Los Angeles to ask for
extensions and other concessions from the state board.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Proposes to Meet With Arafat</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Vice president offers to return for talks next week.
Israel says it will allow the Palestinian leader to travel abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney offered Tuesday to return to the Middle
East as early as next week to meet with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, but only if the Palestinians implement a long-delayed
security plan.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he will
allow the Palestinian leader to travel to an Arab League summit in Beirut
next week from his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, where
Israeli troops have confined him for three months.</LD>
<LD>   But Sharon hinted that Israel may not let Arafat come back if it
doesn't like what he says at the meeting, where Arab states will discuss
a Saudi Middle East peace plan.</LD>
<TE>   Cheney and Sharon made their qualified gestures to Arafat as both
Israelis and Palestinians said they believe that they are close to
declaring a cease-fire after 18 months of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   But violence threatened to torpedo the progress made since U.S. envoy
Anthony C. Zinni arrived here last week for intensive talks with the two
sides. A suspected Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up on a bus at
the start of rush hour this morning, killing at least six people,
including himself, and injuring 28, Israeli television reported.</TE>
<TE>   Initial reports said the bus was bound from Tel Aviv north to Afula
and blew up near the Megiddo junction. Police said the bomber appeared to
have been sitting in the middle of the bus when he detonated his
explosives. Ambulances rushed to the scene. There was no immediate claim
of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, at a joint news conference with Cheney, Sharon said he will
pay close attention to Arafat's statements at the Arab summit to ensure
that he doesn't engage in what Sharon called "incitement."</TE>
<TE>   Nabil abu Rudaineh, a senior aide to Arafat, dismissed Sharon's
comments themselves as "incitement," saying they "do not help further
American peace efforts."</TE>
<TE>   But he welcomed Cheney's offer to meet soon with Arafat. Palestinian
officials had described the vice president's earlier refusal to meet
Arafat as a slap in the face.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider Cheney's comments a positive step ahead and a move in the
right direction. Such a meeting would put the U.S.-Palestinian relations
on the right track," Abu Rudaineh said in Ramallah after Zinni delivered
a letter from Cheney to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, the Palestinian Cabinet issued a statement saying it is
ready to implement a cease-fire "according to a timetable agreed on by
both sides, without any delay," but complained that Israeli troops were
still encircling Palestinian towns and villages.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president would be the most senior member of the Bush
administration to meet with Arafat, who became an almost routine visitor
to the White House during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast with the Bush administration's earlier hands-off approach
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Cheney said in Jerusalem on Tuesday,
"We will remain very actively engaged in this extremely important
effort."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer noted Cheney's offer
to return to the Middle East, saying: "The ingredients are there, and
it's very important now to see what the events are on the ground. As you
know, the president measures these matters in results. The president is
very realistic. He's less interested in talk and more interested in
results."</TE>
<TE>   After three meetings in fewer than 18 hours, Cheney and Sharon
presented a nearly unified front at a joint appearance Tuesday, laying
down markers for Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The first step would be the simultaneous declaration of a cease-fire
by Sharon and Arafat, followed by rapid implementation of the security
plan proposed by CIA Director George J. Tenet. Political negotiations
would follow under a process conceived by an international committee
headed by former Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Maine). The plans are meant
to lead the parties back to negotiations for a comprehensive peace
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said a cease-fire announcement could come today, after
Zinni chairs a meeting of senior Israeli and Palestinian security
officials. It will be the second round of U.S.-sponsored high-level
security talks in 48 hours. Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer
said he thought a cease-fire would be declared by Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney said implementation of the Tenet security plan "requires 100%
effort by Chairman Arafat to stop the violence and the terror, and I
would expect a 100% effort to begin immediately."</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot emphasize enough how important it will be this week for
Chairman Arafat to take the steps to get the cease-fire started and to
start implementation of the Tenet work plan."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he said, Arafat must convey to the Palestinians the
importance of "ending violence and terrorism" and instruct "his security
services to enforce the cease-fire."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in a crowded meeting room near Sharon's office,
Cheney warned that failure to move ahead with Tenet's security plan "will
torpedo this process."</TE>
<TE>   The plan would require Israel to pull back to positions it held before
violence erupted in September 2000, to stop assassinating Palestinian
militants and stop destroying Palestinian Authority security buildings.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli adherence to a cease-fire also depends on the
Palestinians' acceptance of the Tenet plan's demand that they arrest
militants and disarm militias. Arafat and his security forces have been
loath to take those steps without an Israeli commitment to further
territorial withdrawals and the establishment of a Palestinian state in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has agreed to withdraw from areas of the West Bank and Gaza
that it began occupying two weeks ago during a large-scale military
operation. The Palestinians had insisted that they would not discuss a
cease-fire until that pullout was complete.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank town of Beit Sahur on Tuesday, gunmen aligned with
Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement said they are willing to give the
cease-fire a chance but were skeptical that Sharon intends to build on
quiet by starting political negotiations with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Will the cease-fire last? This is very much depending on what is
going to follow the cease-fire declaration," said Ayman abu Aita, an
activist with the Tanzim militia. "If it is not followed with a political
scheme that will bring justice to us, then one bullet will be enough to
bring an end to the cease-fire."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the office where he spoke, life began to return to what passes
for normality in Palestinian-controlled areas these days. Israeli troops
pulled out of Beit Sahur, Bethlehem and neighboring villages before dawn
Tuesday, paving the way for a cease-fire declaration. Residents ventured
out of their homes for the first time in days, as businesspeople reopened
shops and municipalities cleared streets of debris and barricades.</TE>
<TE>   But in Bethlehem's Dahaisha refugee camp, where soldiers rounded up
hundreds of men and boys for questioning last week, Ahmad Mugrabe
surveyed the wreckage of his home, blown up by Israeli troops during an
incursion into the camp March 11. It will take a long time, he said, for
Palestinians to ease their hatred for Israel after the months of
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "They only increased the hatred and deepened the sorrow during their
invasion here," he said. "But still, we hope for some tangible results on
the ground as a result of this weak U.S. intervention."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials, however, viewed Cheney's declaration of a
willingness to meet Arafat as an important shift in the Bush
administration's policy.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney avoided Arafat during his current trip, an 11-day journey that
began in London and ends today in Ankara, the Turkish capital.</TE>
<TE>   By not setting up a meeting with Arafat, Cheney risked undercutting
the central mission of his journey: to win support among leaders of
Islamic nations for further U.S. action in the war on terrorism and, in
particular, a campaign to restrict Iraq's access to weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the countries that the vice president visited would be
called upon to provide logistical support for military action against
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his efforts, the roiling issues of the Middle East overtook
Cheney's agenda, much as they are intruding on the administration's
overall conduct of foreign policy. Leaders in Washington have been forced
to pay heed after President Bush had tried to sidestep the region and its
turmoil during his first year in office.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney sought to dispel the notion that he was ignoring the plight of
the Palestinians while focusing on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, we are working very hard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As he traveled from Jordan to Egypt and then to the Persian Gulf
nations, it became increasingly clear that Cheney would be unable to move
the administration's anti-terrorism campaign forward in the region if the
United States didn't try to calm the violence between Israelis and
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   At virtually every stop, leaders he met hammered that message home
either in public statements before he arrived or in joint news
conferences after they had conferred with him.</TE>

<HD>Drug Tests at Schools Argued at High Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With drug use on the rise again, the Supreme Court justices
strongly hinted Tuesday they are likely to uphold mandatory drug testing
for most or all high school students.</LD>
<LD>   During a sharp back-and-forth argument, several conservative justices
said they, like most parents, want to keep "the druggies" out of their
local schools.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently agreeing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer compared drug testing
to metal detectors at school doors--a new but necessary means of keeping
schools safe.</LD>
<TE>   "If there's a [drug] problem of a serious sort, why can't they do
this?" Breyer asked a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the 4th Amendment and its ban on "unreasonable searches and
seizures" by the government, replied the lawyer, Graham Boyd of New
Haven, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   He was representing a sophomore choir singer at a rural Oklahoma high
school who had objected to the mandatory urine tests that came with
participation in extracurricular activities.</TE>
<TE>   The "core constitutional principle" is that officials must have
"individualized suspicion" before they search someone, Boyd said
confidently as he opened his argument. The government cannot search
everyone in hopes of catching someone, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Within seconds, Breyer cut him off. What about metal detectors? What
about throat swabs, the justice asked in a scornful tone.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the court had upheld an Oregon school board's policy of
testing all of its athletes for drugs. The requirement of "individualized
suspicion" is a figment of the past, Breyer suggested, especially when
the police are not involved.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney stopped, but then continued in a soft voice, as if the
wind had been knocked out of him and his argument. He spent the rest of
his 30 minutes at the lectern backpedaling, as the conservative justices
went on the attack.</TE>
<TE>   It is just not reasonable to test all students in extracurricular
activities, Boyd argued, since there is no evidence of a serious drug
problem in rural Tecumseh, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should I trust your assessment over the local citizens who elect
the school board?" snapped Justice Antonin Scalia. If parents do not like
the policy, they can ask the school board to change it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd pointed out that some parents in the community had opposed the
drug-testing policy and supported the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you saying that if a minority of the parents object, it's
unconstitutional?" asked a skeptical Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who earlier voiced his contempt for the
"drug culture," leaned toward his microphone.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose parents had a choice of schools in the community, he offered.
They could choose to send their child to a "druggie school." Or they
could choose one that was drug-free, a policy enforced by a mandatory
drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   "No parent would send their child to the druggie school--other than
perhaps your client," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Taken aback, Boyd objected. His client, Lindsey Earls, is now a
student at Dartmouth College, and she was never a drug user, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sharp exchange amplified the court's more conservative approach to
issues of student rights.</TE>
<TE>   During the Vietnam War, the high court upheld a student's right to
wear a black armband, saying high school students "do not shed their
constitutional rights at the schoolhouse door," an oft-quoted line.</TE>
<TE>   These days, most of the justices voice a different view.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia said Tuesday that school officials make the rules at school,
and he derided the notion that students have privacy rights.</TE>
<TE>   "You are dealing with minors here. You can keep them in prison in
effect, and say, 'You have to stay after school because you haven't done
your homework,' " he said. "There's a world of difference between minors
and adults."</TE>
<TE>   Scalia wrote the 1995 opinion that upheld drug testing of student
athletes for a 6-3 majority. Since then, it has been unclear whether
schools could test all students, or athletes only.</TE>
<TE>   Lower courts have split on the question.</TE>
<TE>   The Tecumseh school board chose a midpoint, requiring routine and
random tests for all students who participate in after-school activities,
including the band, cheerleaders and the Future Farmers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Only three students tested positive for drugs in the first year,
requiring a school meeting with the parents and their child.</TE>
<TE>   But the ACLU sued on behalf of Earls and the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Denver struck down the policy on a 2-1 vote.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, and Tuesday's argument
had the air of a showdown on the issue of school drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys show that drug use among students rose in the 1990s, the
National School Boards Assn. said in a brief filed with the court. Last
year, 41% of high school seniors said they had used illegal drugs,
according to one survey.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Meoli, the school board's lawyer, called the broader testing
policy "a natural, logical and rational application" of the ruling that
allowed athletes to be tested.</TE>
<TE>   The liberal justices, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said
they feared there was no stopping point if the drug-testing policy wins.</TE>
<TE>   "Your argument is really that all students can be tested," Ginsburg
interjected.</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily, Meoli replied. Students can choose not to participate
in after-school activities.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Bush administration's deputy solicitor general, Paul
Clement, rose to defend the school board, he agreed all students can be
tested.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it would be constitutional" to test everyone, said Clement,
a former clerk to Scalia.</TE>
<TE>   The argument had gotten off to a bad start for the school board
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, usually the swing vote in close cases,
said she found the drug-testing policy peculiar. Students in
extracurricular activities were the least likely to be drug users, she
said. Why test them? "It's counterintuitive, isn't it?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Connor was one of the three dissenters in the 1995 case, and her
vote is unlikely to sway the outcome this time either.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer joined the conservative side to form the majority in 1995, and
he said he saw no reason to strike down the school's policy in the new
case.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling in the case, Board of Education of Pottawatomie County vs.
Earls, 01-332, is expected by summer.</TE>

<HD>There Was Something About Mary</HD>
<DH>Eulogy: Bakersfield mourns a homeless woman who touched people's
hearts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD
</DL>
<LD>She may not have had a permanent home, but it turns out "Downtown
Mary" had plenty of neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   About 100 of them jammed a funeral parlor Tuesday to bid farewell to
the stooped, smiling, disheveled woman whose sweet humility made the
streets a little less mean in this sprawling oil and cotton patch town of
275,000.</LD>
<LD>   Mabel Elaine Neal, known as Downtown Mary because she was a fixture
for decades along the broad avenues rimming the rail yards, died at 70 of
heart trouble last week. The service drew police and business leaders;
firefighters, who had twice saved her life in motel blazes, carried her
casket. The mayor and City Council sent flowers.</LD>
<TE>   People around here say that what they did for Mary was partly because
of who she was, a kind and gentle soul who lived off handouts and carried
a milk carton full of water to nourish plants in front of downtown shops,
picking up litter along her way. And partly it was because of what
Bakersfield is: "the biggest small town in America," said Rita Baker, who
works at Bakersfield Family Funeral Directors.</TE>
<TE>   More blunt was Steve Swenson, a reporter at the local newspaper, the
Californian, who came to town more than 20 years ago intending to stay
only long enough to beef up his resume but somehow never left.</TE>
<TE>   "People make fun of us as an armpit of California," Swenson said. "We
make up for that by caring for each other."</TE>
<TE>   One woman wrote a song for her. Others read poetry praising the simple
public-spiritedness Mary displayed by sweeping sidewalks on her daily
rounds through the aging central city.</TE>
<TE>   A sweet-faced 10-year-old named Ericca Chavez stood in front of the
crowded pews and said she cried when she heard Mary died. A bushy-bearded
man named Kenneth, who smelled of the tequila his T-shirt advertised,
said he lived on the streets with Mary. "She smiled at me every morning,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>It's Hard to Explain, Because She Never Did</TE>
<TE>   There are homeless and street people throughout America, but few get a
send-off like the one for Mary, who died in a motel room she'd lived in
for two years.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral service, the flowers, the burial plot were all donated. A
doctor in town promised to raise money for a headstone.</TE>
<TE>   Mary's story is hard to explain, in part because she never bothered to
do so herself. She turned aside questions about herself, telling those
who asked that she was "Mary, just Mary." To everyone she was Downtown
Mary, the woman with sharp blue eyes who, rain or shine, sizzling heat or
foggy cold, always wore the same drab brown coat. That was enough for the
people who encountered her over the years. Because her story was unknown,
others wrote it for her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd always see her walking the streets," said Beth Reeves of Taft.
Reeves said she once offered Mary a blanket, but the woman turned it
down, saying she had enough to keep her warm. "You take that blanket and
give it to someone else," Mary told her. Then, "I got to hug her."</TE>
<TE>   Another woman said she used to take holiday meals to Mary, adding that
she felt cheated because she'd known of her only for four years. Martin
Morin, the former owner of MG Morin's cafe, gave her breakfast. Laughter
erupted in the room when another mourner said Mary refused food from her,
apparently because she was getting fed at so many other places.</TE>
<TE>   One woman had trouble speaking through her tears. She said that years
ago, when her family didn't have much money, she was on her way to buy a
pair of shoes for her husband for Christmas. Passing Mary, she stopped
and offered $8 to the street woman.</TE>
<TE>   Mary refused it, saying, "Don't you need that for your family?"</TE>
<TE>   So what was it that inspired all these people to reach out to this
street woman who was so secretive and shy that she never told anyone
about her past?</TE>
<TE>   All the mourners could say was that there was something in Mary's blue
eyes that drew them in, and in her smile, as warm and welcoming as she
was personally mysterious, that made them pull their cars to the side of
the road and get out to help her.</TE>
<TE>   But their words revealed just as much about them. Bakersfield has
changed since its economy was dominated by oil and agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Though it remains the carrot capital of the world, it has diversified
and shopping mall-ified itself so much over the years that some longtime
residents are angry at the way things have been allowed to change.</TE>
<TE>   Still, locals say, at heart it is the same unassuming rest stop on
California 99 that it was when Terrible Herbst attracted travelers with
its rock-bottom gas prices.</TE>
<TE>   Swenson, the reporter, said he was not surprised by the turnout at the
funeral home. "I will never leave this town," he said. "People are too
nice."</TE>
<TE>A Life Story Emerges at Funeral</TE>
<TE>   Unexpectedly, as more people spoke, Mary's own story began to take
shape. One woman remembered Mary from the '70s, when she was living in
Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, her tidy habits were in place. She could be seen every
morning cleaning up trash in front of shops. The woman moved to the San
Joaquin Valley several years later. When an old friend from Glendale took
a train for a visit, she found Mary on board. Asked where she was going,
Mary was typically friendly but evasive.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield, she said. Why? the woman asked. "I have a relative
there," was all Mary would say.</TE>
<TE>   The next funeral speaker drew gasps when he revealed himself as Mary's
stepbrother, who had lived in Bakersfield for many years and had even
taken note of the woman in the shabby brown coat without recognizing who
it was.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in Firth"--Mary's Idaho hometown--"and knew her as a little
girl," said Patrick Williams. "She hardly ever talked to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow she landed in Glendale and then Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   "If only we had known" she was in town, Williams said, fighting tears.
"But maybe you were happier the way you were."</TE>
<TE>   "Anyway, that's the story of a little girl that lived a tragic life.
She's my stepsister."</TE>
<TE>   Even Williams could not say what made her so introverted, or what
experiences cast her into the streets. He did know one thing, he said.
"She would have been proud to see all of you here."</TE>

<HD>Saudi Editor Retracts Article That Defamed Jews</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>A prominent Saudi Arabian editor Tuesday criticized and disavowed
an article that appeared recently in his own newspaper, Al Riyadh, that
repeated the century-old fiction that Jews use the blood of Christians
and Muslims to make holiday foods.</LD>
<LD>   The article proved a possible embarrassment to the ruling
establishment, which is just beginning to shake loose from the barrage of
criticism it received after the Sept. 11 attacks, when it became clear
that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Saudi Arabia also had
begun to emerge as a peacemaker with its sketchy plan for ending the
Israeli-Palestinian violence.</LD>
<LD>   The editor, Turki al Sudairy, said he was upset to discover that while
he was in Lebanon, his paper ran a two-part series by a professor that
vilified Jews and the holiday of Purim--and embellished a tale dismissed
long ago as the product of deeply anti-Semitic thinking.</LD>
<TE>   "I went back to the article and found it unfit for publishing because
it is not based on any historical or scientific fact but in fact is
against every religious ritual in the world, including Buddhism and
Hinduism," Sudairy wrote in a column that appeared Tuesday, adding that
the article's "credibility is nil."</TE>
<TE>   Although Sudairy said the article had slipped through the cracks and
never should have been published, the fact that it appeared over a
two-day period reflects the willingness of governments in this region to
use the media as a safety valve for the deep animosity their people feel
toward Israel and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Al Riyadh is a privately owned paper, but there is censorship in Saudi
Arabia, and there was no effort to block publication of the article.</TE>
<TE>   An article that appeared recently in Al Akhbar, the government-owned
Egyptian daily, suggested that President Nixon was run out of office by a
Jewish conspiracy because he criticized "Jewish domination in American
society."</TE>
<TE>   The article, under the headline "Jewish Influence Dominates U.S.
Society," said: "Nixon resigned in September 1974 following a campaign
launched by the Washington Post (known for its support of Israel) after
the release of tapes implicating him in a political cover-up."</TE>
<TE>   Adel Hammouda, editor in chief of one of Egypt's most sensational
newspapers, Sawt al Umma, said that given the intensity of the Israeli
military campaign against the Palestinians, it was only natural that
anti-Semitic feelings would spread through the region. And he said that
governments, even those that call for peace and harmony with Israel, can
do nothing to stop the expression of those feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Palestinian intifada against Israeli rule began in
late September 2000, Hammouda wrote an article that appeared in Egypt's
main daily newspaper, Al Ahram, that also repeated the "blood libel"
against Jews. Although the article flatly stated that the practice was
continuing, with Israeli Jews taking the blood of Palestinian children to
bake Passover matzo, Hammouda now says he doesn't believe that the
practice is contemporary--but that it did occur in Damascus, Syria, in
the 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to show how cheap non-Jewish blood is to Jews," he said
Monday of his Oct. 28, 2000, column.</TE>
<TE>   The blood-fiction was embellished in a March 10 article in Al Riyadh
in which Umayma Ahmad Jalahma of King Faisal University in Dammam wrote
about Purim: "This holiday has some dangerous customs that will, no
doubt, horrify you, and I apologize if any reader is harmed because of
this.</TE>
<TE>   "During this holiday, the Jew must prepare very special pastries, the
filling of which is not only costly and rare--it cannot be found at all
on the local and international markets."</TE>
<TE>   Sudairy said he learned of the article when his Washington bureau
chief, Ahmad Yami, phoned him in Lebanon. Sudairy said the newspaper then
severed relations with the author--who couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   He said the article was inaccurate and that it attacked all Jews. His
column tried to steer his readers back to the distinction between all
Jews and what he calls "Zionists."</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Jalahma failed to realize this serious mistake in
misinformation, and she failed to realize that Jews anywhere in the world
are one thing, while those belonging to the Zionism movement who are
eradicating Palestinians is a completely different thing," he wrote. "In
Israel itself, there are moderate Jews--and it is unacceptable that our
differences with specimens like that of [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel]
Sharon should be the incentive to generalize our hatred toward all Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he concluded: "It is unacceptable to circulate a silly and
untrue piece of information about using human blood in the food of other
humans whoever they are, because this does not exist in the world at
all."</TE>

<LD>Interference from Iran is emerging as one of the most vexing
problems for allied interests in Afghanistan because the Islamic Republic
continues to allow Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters to escape across its
border, the director of the CIA told members of Congress on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Characterizing Iran's behavior as "worse than schizoid," CIA Director
George J. Tenet said that Tehran's initial signs of cooperation with the
United States in the war in Afghanistan "are being eclipsed by Iranian
efforts to undermine U.S. influence there."</LD>
<LD>   In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Tenet
signaled that the United States could face a number of dangerous battles
and operations in Afghanistan before the terrorist threat there is
contained.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet said allied forces have been frustrated by their inability to
prevent the enemy from escaping, and he noted that intelligence agencies
have identified additional "pockets of Al Qaeda and Taliban" fighters
hiding in eastern provinces that border Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the United States remains vulnerable to attack by members
of the Al Qaeda network, even though the war on terrorism has led to more
than 1,300 arrests in 70 countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda leaders still at large are working to reconstitute the
organization," Tenet said. "As spring emerges, we'll see, maybe, more
activity on their part."</TE>
<TE>   In only his second public appearance before Congress since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, Tenet discussed a wide range of challenges, from
the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons to what he said was
a shrinking advantage that the United States holds in satellite
technology.</TE>
<TE>   But he spent the bulk of the session providing a progress report on
the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-led operation in Afghanistan "has dealt severe blows to Al
Qaeda and its leadership," he said. "The group is no longer able to run
large-scale training and recruitment programs in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   But he offered no new information on the whereabouts of Osama bin
Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Several committee members pressed Tenet for details on Iraq. The White
House has made it clear that it aims to topple President Saddam Hussein's
regime, even though Vice President Dick Cheney is encountering
substantial resistance to such plans during his current tour of the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet declined to assess either the strength of groups within Iraq
that could serve as proxy forces for the U.S. military or the potential
successors to Hussein, saying he would discuss the matter later in a
closed-door session.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad continues to pursue nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction, Tenet said. Asked whether any evidence ties Iraq to the
Sept. 11 attacks, Tenet said that there have been contacts between
Hussein's government and Al Qaeda but that "the jury's out" on any more
direct link to the assault on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet offered a particularly pessimistic assessment of Iran, saying
that momentum for reform within the country appears to have ebbed and
that there is little sign that Tehran has reduced its support for
terrorist activities in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, there have been reports that Iranian military and
intelligence operatives have entered Afghanistan and are working to
destabilize the government of interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai. Tenet
acknowledged that such activities are a major concern but declined to
discuss the matter in public session.</TE>
<TE>   He did single out Iran for being particularly uncooperative in sealing
its eastern border, saying that Tehran "has failed to move decisively
against Al Qaeda members" crossing into its territory.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Qaeda network is headed by members of the Sunni branch of Islam
who have traditionally been at odds with the Shiite regime in Iran. But
Tenet said the United States can no longer count on such religious
divisions in ruling out collaboration on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a convergence of common interest in hurting the United
States and its allies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The porous border with Iran is part of a broader problem that allies
have faced in sealing off enemy escape routes. "We're frustrated that
people did get away," Tenet said. "We have worked pretty hard on it, but
there's still many, many points of exit that people in small numbers can
get out."</TE>

<HD>Currency's Bust Is Tourists' Boon</HD>
<DH>S. Africa: Value of rand has fallen, making food, hotels cheap for
visitors. Film industry, real estate agents also get boost, but residents
feel the pinch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>New Yorkers Antoinette Cole and Avril Weekes were astounded when
the waiter at a trendy restaurant in this cosmopolitan port city brought
the check for lunch.</LD>
<LD>   They had devoured generous portions of Greek salad, seafood salad,
calamari, fish and chips and a variety of beverages. The bill was less
than $12.</LD>
<LD>   "One person couldn't have eaten [that well] for that price in New
York," said Cole, 40, who was visiting South Africa with Weekes recently
for the first time, taking a five-day package tour.</LD>
<TE>   Although Cole, a bank employee, acknowledged that she typically takes
at least one vacation a year in a country where the currency has
depreciated against the dollar, South Africa offered the best value she
had encountered in a long while.</TE>
<TE>   Cole's experience is being shared by thousands of foreigners who have
visited South Africa in recent months. A plunge in the rand, the
currency, is giving this nation the dubious distinction of being cheap to
visit. The bargains have sent tourists, property buyers and filmmakers
flocking to its shores.</TE>
<TE>   The rand depreciated almost 40% last year. At one point, it hit a low
of 13.85 to the greenback, compared with about 7 to the dollar at the
beginning of 2001. The rand has recovered to about 11.5 to the dollar,
but analysts said that has not repaired the image of this once-respected
currency.</TE>
<TE>   The rand's fall has diminished the buying power of South Africa's 43
million people, driving the price of imported and dollar-linked goods
such as fuel, cotton products, fertilizer and equipment for growing
maize--a staple in most black households here--out of the reach of the
poor. Higher animal feed prices are likely to make meat and dairy
products more expensive, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   However, for those in the businesses of tourism, film, real estate and
exporting, the currency's misfortune is bringing good fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "The fall of the rand has created incredible value for money," said
Sheryl Ozinsky, manager of the Cape Town Tourism Bureau. "It's incredible
what people can have: accommodation, food, wine and electronics for
ridiculous prices."</TE>
<TE>   From late December to mid-January, Cape Town received about 500,000
visitors, Ozinsky said. The figure would have been 10% to 15% lower if
the rand had not fallen, she estimated. "We've generally had it better
now than it ever has been before," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For those with foreign currency, there are ample opportunities to
splurge. The Mount Nelson Hotel, a highly rated establishment in Cape
Town, is charging $90 a night for a room that would easily cost $350 to
$400 in the United States. Budget rooms for the backpacking crowd can
cost as little as $6 a night, Ozinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the food. At the equivalent of 82 cents, a Big Mac
costs less in South Africa than any other place on the globe, according
to the Economist magazine's annual Big Mac Index. A three-course steak
dinner at a top-notch Cape Town restaurant will set you back less than
$10.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials are at a loss to explain why the rand has
dropped. Critics argue that the depreciation is a vote of no confidence
in President Thabo Mbeki's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The South African president has called for a commission to probe the
rapid depreciation of the rand. The panel will investigate whether
businesses--and specifically banks--have manipulated the rand for
financial benefit.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, major businesses such as the film industry are taking
advantage of the currency's decline.</TE>
<TE>   "It has certainly made things a bit film-friendlier and more
attractive to a lot of people overseas," said Malcolm Calderwood,
supervisor at the Cape Town Film office, which is responsible for issuing
permits for photo and film shoots in the city.</TE>
<TE>   In December, 300 permits were issued, Calderwood said. In January,
that figure shot up to 600, almost double the number of January 2001. The
permits cost $22 to $160 a day.</TE>
<TE>   "The fall of the rand has been part of the reason some film companies
that would normally go to Miami are now coming here," Calderwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Cape Town's cosmopolitan atmosphere and other amenities, coupled with
the ailing rand, have also led to a flurry of activity in real estate as
foreigners with access to stronger and convertible currencies snap up
prime properties.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a little bit of a feeding frenzy since September," said
Laurie Wener, an agent with Pam Golding Properties, the country's largest
real estate agency. "The sudden drop of the rand has given people with
foreign currency an opportunity to purchase purely as an indulgence."</TE>
<TE>   In December 1999, for example, the agency took in between $7.7 million
and $9 million worth of business, according to chief executive Andrew
Golding. In December 2001, revenue was about $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, [foreign] visitors come back three or four times and then
buy," Golding said. "This year, we have many first-time buyers. There has
definitely been a purchasing phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   According to Golding, typical buyers are middle-aged Britons and
Germans looking for a second home, and young professionals who purchase
on impulse while vacationing.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of commercial properties to foreigners also have increased, with
four vineyards purchased in the past year, Golding said.</TE>
<TE>   Wener, the real estate agent, and others believe that the terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ironically have put
South Africa--notorious for its high crime rate--on the map as a safer
haven to visit.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Sept. 11 massacre, South Africa was no longer No. 1 on the
violence list," Wener said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the influx of foreigners has aroused a degree of resentment
among residents. Some are bitter about not being able to afford prime
real estate on their own doorstep, and some politicians have suggested
imposing regulations on foreign ownership of property.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands now, nonresidents are not subject to exchange controls
and can take any profit they make and repatriate it, Wener said. She
noted that many local banks also make it easy for foreigners to acquire
loans to purchase property.</TE>
<TE>   But Golding and other businesspeople said the envy that some South
Africans feel over the good fortune of those who hold foreign currency is
far outweighed by the desire many have for global recognition. The
overriding sentiment is that foreign visitors can have positive
repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   "What the country needs most are tourists to create jobs," said Sanita
Van der Merwe, who, since the rand fell, has seen a 30% increase in sales
at her exclusive shop selling handmade linens in the historic winemaking
town of Stellenbosch. "I'm not saying that I want the rand to continue to
fall. But we really hope we get a lot more people coming this way."</TE>

<HD>Gem Tied to Terror Loses Sparkle</HD>
<DH>East Africa: Reports that Al Qaeda controlled part of the tanzanite
trade have sent the stone's price plunging and left miners in the lurch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MERERANI, Tanzania
</DL>
<LD>The young miners here are known as wanapollo, Swahili for spacemen.
Several times a day, they emerge from half a mile below the earth, their
dark bodies coated in glittering graphite dust.</LD>
<LD>   They are in search of tanzanite, a gem found in a 5-square-mile patch
of scrub near the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro.</LD>
<LD>   A few months ago, Mohammed Abubakar supported his mother and eight
siblings with money earned from mining the blue-violet stone. But since
Sept. 11, reports that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network controlled a
chunk of the tanzanite trade have sent the price of the gemstone plunging
by about 70%, slashing his earnings.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. retailers Tiffany &amp; Co. and Zale Corp. and the QVC television
shopping channel, which together sold about 80% of the tanzanite, have
suspended sales, saying they didn't want to be associated with Bin
Laden--if allegations regarding his links to the stone are true.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, tanzanite has become one of the most popular colored
gemstones in the U.S., thanks to jewelers who tout it as less expensive
and bluer than sapphire.</TE>
<TE>   "Soon, these stones are going to be as valuable as concrete," Abubakar
grumbled to a reporter recently.</TE>
<TE>   Abubakar's economic pain demonstrates how the U.S. war on terrorism is
being felt across the globe--from travelers at international airports to
poor miners in Tanzania's hinterlands.</TE>
<TE>   Mererani has become a town filled with recrimination and questions:
Did an influential Muslim cleric encourage believers to sell stones to
people allegedly linked to Bin Laden? What role, if any, did a wealthy
tanzanite dealer play in helping to fund Al Qaeda? And most important,
can tanzanite survive the taint of Bin Laden?</TE>
<TE>   Tanzanite's links to Bin Laden were suspected long before Sept. 11,
but no one seemed to care. During last year's trial of four men accused
of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, a prosecution witness testified that Al Qaeda
operatives fattened the terror network's coffers by trading in
commodities including animal hides, sugar and tanzanite.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors alleged that Tanzanite was the code name for Bin
Laden's personal secretary, Wadih El-Hage, who was convicted by a New
York federal jury for his role in running Bin Laden's businesses during
the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   From Nairobi, El-Hage operated a company known as Tanzanite King.
El-Hage's diary, which FBI agents seized in 1997, detailed how he
traveled to London, Los Angeles and San Francisco, marketing the gem to
jewelry stores, according to federal sources.</TE>
<TE>   Another key player, according to miners, brokers and industry
officials, was Sheikh Omar Suleyman. They said that as head of the Taqwa
mosque here he encouraged believers to sell their tanzanite to Bin Laden
loyalists, who smuggled the gemstones to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
Suleyman denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Tanzanian authorities worry that reports about Bin Laden's involvement
with tanzanite could destroy the livelihood of tens of thousands of
mining families.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. market for tanzanite is drying up, Mererani, which once
resembled a California gold rush town, is slowly becoming a ghost town.
Bars have gone quiet. Many people who came here dreaming of expensive
cars and luxurious homes are returning to their villages empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all because of this Bin Laden," Abubakar said. "That man should
be caught and killed straight away."</TE>
<TE>'It Doesn't Pay to Make the Americans Angry'</TE>
<TE>   Salome Chami, who runs a boarding house, complained that several
tenants recently had skipped out without paying. "It doesn't pay to make
the Americans angry at you," she said. "People know that if Americans
[aren't] buying tanzanite, there's no reason to stay in Mererani."</TE>
<TE>   Tanzanian officials say they would need to conduct an exhaustive
investigation to determine Al Qaeda's interest in the gem.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Rutabanzibwa, permanent secretary in Tanzania's Ministry of
Mines, said the government could account for only about 5% of the nearly
$400 million in tanzanite exported last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say that no, no, no, Al Qaeda has no interest in tanzanite,"
Rutabanzibwa said from his office in Dar es Salaam. "What we can say is
that there is a lot of smuggling of tanzanite, which really means the
government doesn't know how it gets out of the country, let alone who is
actually involved in it. The wealth that they get out of that trade is
something we can only speculate about."</TE>
<TE>   Abubakar and other miners say they long for the period preceding Sept.
11, when all that people in Mererani cared about was making money,
providing for their families and having a good time.</TE>
<TE>   Tanzanite transformed Mererani into a major job center. An estimated
30,000 people from across Tanzania relocated here. As more of the brown
ore--it turns blue after being heated--was brought to the surface, mud
huts were replaced by brick houses sporting satellite dishes. Toyota Land
Cruiser taxis ferried workers from Kilimanjaro International Airport to
the mines. Bars and brothels with "New York" and "Hollywood" in their
names appeared overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Abubakar heard about it in his small village outside Arusha, about 80
miles away. He made the two-hour trip and worked out a deal with a mine
owner: He would toil for food, a place to sleep in the shacks on the mine
premises and a small commission.</TE>
<TE>   To blast a mining tunnel, Abubakar and co-workers, some of whom look
no older than 13, stick dynamite in an air pocket, then scamper up a
ladder cobbled together from scrap lumber to escape the blast.</TE>
<TE>   The air in the mine after the blast can top 120 degrees and can be
lethal. The young miners have little or no safety equipment--no goggles,
no masks, not even headlamps, although cheap flashlights are strapped to
their bare heads or, sometimes, helmets with strips of black inner-tube
rubber.</TE>
<TE>   Blasting is the easy part. The young miners must climb ladders with
plastic sacks containing rubble from the bottom of the mines.
Occasionally, an exhausted miner drops his 50-pound sack on comrades
below.</TE>
<TE>Miners Were Able to Support Entire Families</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, Abubakar earned up to $100 a month. That was enough
to support his entire family and to pay for his numerous sprees at the
brothels. He earned extra money by selling small tanzanite pieces to
red-robed Masai tribesmen, many of whom abandoned their cattle-raising
during the tanzanite rush to become gem brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Masai brokers traveled to Arusha, where they sold the stones to
jewelers who export them mainly to Jaipur, India; Bangkok, Thailand; and
New York.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the gems ended up in places like the Kristalle jewelry
store in Laguna Beach, where owner Wayne Leicht recently sold a large
uncut tanzanite for $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   For Mererani, the biggest blow came when Tiffany, the gem's main
retailer, stopped selling tanzanite at its 126 stores worldwide. The
company, said spokeswoman Linda Buckley, bought tanzanite from
established U.S. sources but "it's very difficult to track the origin of
a stone as it travels from rough to cut and polished."</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany "has no reason to believe that the tanzanite we purchased in
any way . . . benefited the Al Qaeda network," she said. "But we felt
that until we have more information, it's best to suspend sales."</TE>
<TE>   Suleyman, the head of the local mosque, denied in an interview that
the mosque was used in Bin Laden's tanzanite trade. "The Koran teaches
that we can't use the mosque for these purposes," he said. "It would be a
big sin to do so." He also denied that his mosque, now under
construction, was being bankrolled by Abdulhakim Mulla, arguably the
region's largest tanzanite dealer.</TE>
<TE>Gem Broker Denies Connection to Bin Laden</TE>
<TE>   Competitors say Suleyman instructed his followers to sell their
gemstones exclusively to Mulla, who sent them to Dubai, where Al Qaeda
operatives resold them.</TE>
<TE>   Mulla, the 43-year-old son of Iranian immigrants, said he plowed
profits from his tanzanite business into many other business ventures. He
recently bought the Tanzania Wildlife Corp. from the government. For
about $2,000 a day, the company permits sport hunters to kill zebras,
wildebeest and other wild animals in Tanzania's game reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Mulla also denied any connection to Bin Laden in a recent interview.
"Some jealous people want to destroy me," he said. "I don't know a thing
about Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   He opened one of the large steel vaults in his office and scooped up
two handfuls of glittering tanzanite. "If people hear that these stones
are helping to kill innocent people, no one is going to buy them," he
said. "My business will be finished."</TE>
<TE>   A Tanzanian delegation headed by Minister of Mines Edgar Maokola
Majogo traveled to a gemstone show in Tucson, Ariz., last month to
proclaim that there were no known links between tanzanite and terrorism,
and that the government would take steps to ensure that the gemstone
doesn't fall into the wrong hands. For the miners of Mererani, the
promises are too late.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Steve Braun in Washington and Hector Becerra in
Los Angeles contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Homeland Beckons Afghanistan's Exiled Monarch</HD>
<DH>Asia: Mohammad Zaher Shah intends to travel the country on his
return. He says he's ready to assume the throne if that is 'the will of
the nation.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OLGIATA, Italy
</DL>
<LD>Mohammad Zaher Shah greets visitors to his suburban villa with a
firm handshake and a bold announcement for a man of 87: After nearly
three decades in exile, he is coming out of seclusion to plunge into the
tumultuous and bloody politics of the Afghanistan he once ruled as king.</LD>
<LD>   His regal bearing, piercing gaze and mental agility during an hourlong
interview left little doubt that he feels ready. Set to return home
Tuesday to a mammoth public welcome, he said he wishes to live out his
days "calming the passions" of his country after its 23 years of civil
war.</LD>
<LD>   "Afghanistan is passing through a difficult period of its history
because there is no real center of power in the country," he said,
lamenting the proliferation of warlord fiefdoms since Taliban rule
collapsed last fall. "The most urgent need is unity among the different
[tribal] groups, provinces and ethnic factions."</LD>
<TE>   Anti-Taliban factions that forged an interim governing council in
December have invited Zaher Shah, the country's most popular elder, to
gavel a loya jirga into session June 22. The assembly is to chart a
two-year transition to democratic rule and choose a provisional head of
state.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than wait for that ceremony, the former monarch said he
intends to travel the country and mix with crowds, despite evident
security risks. And, for the first time, he made it clear that he would
return to the throne if people vote for that, "because nobody should
oppose the will of the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah's promised activism would be a switch from the
reclusiveness of his life in this gated suburb of Rome since a jealous
cousin deposed him in 1973 and abolished the monarchy. Compatriots and
foreign envoys over the years pleaded for his return to help end a series
of Afghan wars that began in 1978, but they often found him aloof and
irresolute.</TE>
<TE>   The supplicants came back in droves after Sept. 11, when attacks on
America triggered the U.S.-led war that has all but routed the Taliban
and its notorious guests, the terrorists of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network. The ex-monarch received the visitors but, at the behest of
Italian authorities, did not venture from his heavily guarded villa until
his farewell call last week on President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.</TE>
<TE>   Two American reporters who passed through the villa's iron gate late
Sunday first had to clear three police checkpoints and a metal detector,
undergo a body search and surrender their cell phones. Seated in a simple
wooden armchair in his modern four-bedroom home, Zaher Shah complained of
feeling "a kind of imprisonment." He said he would accept no such
restrictions in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a tradition," he said, recalling his 40-year reign, "that I go
around in the country and I mix with the population. There should not be
any barriers between me and the people. . . . This close physical contact
is something necessary at all costs."</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan today is far more unruly than under the constitutional
monarchy of Zaher Shah. U.S.-led forces are chasing remnants of Al Qaeda
and the Taliban, whose fundamentalist rule gave way to factional
struggles among regional and tribal leaders. The new national army is a
collection of militias loyal to ethnic Pushtun, Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara
warlords, prone to bloody clashes.</TE>
<TE>   Hamid Karzai, the Zaher Shah loyalist who leads the interim
government, has failed to halt feuding among his own Pushtuns, the
largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. A mob killed one of his ministers
last month. The former king, also a Pushtun, is scorned by religious
fundamentalists and Tajiks loyal to the pre-Taliban ruler, Burhanuddin
Rabbani, who clings to a wing of the former royal palace in Kabul, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the risks, "it's going to be a heroic comeback," said
Margherita Boniver, the Italian Foreign Ministry undersecretary who is
organizing the journey for Zaher Shah, three of his six children, three
grandchildren and three cousins.</TE>
<TE>   They will fly to Kabul on an Italian air force plane, protected by 10
Italian military police officers. The trip was delayed about a week so
masons can finish erecting a security wall around the two-story home
where they will live. The house was being built for one of his sons when
the king was deposed; it was last occupied by a Taliban deputy prime
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah professes to be fearless and fatalistic about death. In the
interview, he recalled watching the assassination of his father, Mohammad
Nadir Khan, by a student during a school celebration in the palace--the
regicide that put Zaher Shah on the throne at age 19.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was surrounded by all these people devoted to him, and
still a boy pulled out a pistol and shot him in the chest," he said. "So,
whatever the security, if someone is determined, he can manage to hit his
target."</TE>
<TE>   The deposed king said he passed up previous overtures to go home for
fear that his presence might aggravate bloody divisions but today is
"counting the hours and the minutes" until the trip, convinced that most
Afghans will welcome him.</TE>
<TE>   He displayed little emotion about the journey, but aides say he is
euphoric. "It's a totally different kind of enthusiasm from what I saw in
him six or eight months ago," said his spokesman, Hamid Sidig.</TE>
<TE>   That feeling is shared by many Afghans, who are putting up Zaher
Shah's portrait and planning a ceremonial welcome in Kabul that will
feature traditional drums and a dance called the atan performed by men in
white robes.</TE>
<TE>   People from one province, Paktia, are supplying 500 drums for the
occasion and rubbing oil into them, "so it should sound good and loud,"
said Zia Mohadedi, a member of Zaher Shah's staff in Kabul. Pushtun
elders in the southern province of Kandahar have invited the ex-king to
visit them, saying he'll be safer there and freer to move about than in
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "In those historic years that he reigned, those 40 years, Afghans had
a wonderful life," said Abdul Karim Brahoui, the Pushtun governor of
Nimruz province. "So he is the best person for the country now."</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be the most significant figure in Afghanistan," said
Selig S. Harrison, an American specialist on South Asia at the Center for
International Policy in Washington. "But the question is whether any one
person can stabilize the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Some supporters want Zaher Shah to speak against the continued U.S.
campaign on grounds that it is killing civilians and shoring up
anti-Taliban warlords who are disloyal to Karzai's government.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, the former king refused to join in such criticism.
"There are times when action is necessary to eradicate something that is
bad in itself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Karzai's battered authority, Zaher Shah voiced confidence in
the interim leader and quipped that the sartorially conspicuous Karzai's
"international stature is due not only to his cloak." He welcomed
Karzai's plan to come to Rome and accompany him on the flight to Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   But he added that his own role is to stay above the fray. "It's a
wrong policy to take sides in any quarrel," the former monarch said.</TE>
<TE>   Petitioners are already lining up. One Pushtun warlord wants Zaher
Shah's backing to rid Paktia of Tajik troops sent by the national army to
fight the Taliban. How would his majesty respond?</TE>
<TE>   "Differences in Afghanistan have always existed, but we should not
exaggerate by making everything sound as if Pushtuns are fighting
Tajiks," Zaher Shah said. "There are individuals who have contradictory
interests, and sometimes they fight. My formula is to use patience,
talks, persuasion and, when necessary, force."</TE>
<TE>   The elderly exile, a tall but stooped figure in an elegant gray suit,
was animated and joked dryly during the interview, tiring slightly near
the end. He snuffed out a cigar before starting and gestured gently with
his right hand, punctuating the soft cadence of his native Dari tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Abdul Wali--his cousin, son-in-law and former military
commander--served as interpreter, corrected at times by two other
English-speaking cousins.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about some supporters' demands that he be lodged in his former
palace, Zaher Shah said that the central heating and plumbing don't work
and that a complex of underground passages makes it hard to protect. He
laughed at the idea that a building matters.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any special sentiments about that," he said. "I'm not
going to a home or a house. I'm going to my land, even if I live under a
tent. It's my country."</TE>

<LD>U.S. officials said Tuesday that a suspected prominent member of
the Al Qaeda terrorist network was not in custody in Sudan, denying media
reports that Anas Al-Liby had been captured.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Liby "is not in Sudanese custody," one official said on condition

<LD>   A man who is in custody is "not the same person" as the one on the
FBI's most-wanted terrorist list, another official said.</LD>
<TE>   The official would not reveal the identity of the detained man.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British newspapers had reported that the man was the most
senior member of Al Qaeda to be captured since the start of the U.S.-led
war in Afghanistan in October. The reports said the U.S. had been
negotiating with Sudan to have him transferred to Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Sudanese official denied reports of Al-Liby's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "We in the government do not have any knowledge of this, and I do not

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Islamabad's police chief and four other senior police officials
were fired Tuesday after a deadly grenade attack on a Protestant church
attended by foreigners.</LD>
<LD>   The shake-up came as police said they would send DNA samples from the
body of a man they suspect carried out the attack to the United States.
The attack Sunday killed five people, including two Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-five other people, most of them foreigners, were hurt when an
attacker hurled grenades into the church near the U.S. Embassy during a
morning service.</LD>
<TE>   The attack on the Protestant International Church has prompted the
State Department to warn Americans against traveling to Pakistan. In
Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United
States was sending a team of agents from the department's Bureau of
Diplomatic Security to help with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, ordered "immediate and
effective steps" to improve law and order after meeting with top security
officials and regional officials Tuesday to review the case. The people
want "quick justice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but investigators
are focusing on Islamic extremists outraged by Musharraf's support for
the U.S. in its war on terrorism.</TE>

<DL>UPPER MANGGAS, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>Muslim extremists unleashed a volley of grenades and small arms
fire on a Philippine army patrol Tuesday, wounding two soldiers and
prompting Green Berets to try to retrieve the injured men--only the
second time Americans have ventured into the combat zone.</LD>
<LD>   The clash between about 30 Philippine troops and a group of Abu Sayyaf
rebels erupted within earshot of the Green Berets as they attended a town
meeting on the southern island of Basilan to discuss residents' safety
concerns.</LD>
<LD>   At least four rebels were killed in several hours of fighting near the
town of Lantawan, officials said. Elite Philippine troops captured six
rebels as they fled the fighting.</LD>
<TE>   After a series of frantic radio calls, the four Green Berets learned
that a Philippine platoon commander and one of his men were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The elite U.S. troops piled into a pickup truck and headed out to
evacuate the wounded Philippine soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy fighting blocked the rescue effort, and the two wounded soldiers
eventually were pulled by their comrades to the safety of a helicopter
landing zone where they were tended to by the Green Berets.</TE>
<TE>   About 660 U.S. troops are in the south to train Philippine forces to
fight the rebels. The Americans have been in combat zones only to treat
the wounded. On Friday, two U.S. helicopters evacuated three wounded
Philippine soldiers.</TE>

<LD>Gunmen in eastern Afghanistan attacked forces of the U.S.-led
coalition, touching off a firefight that lasted several hours, an
American military spokesman said today.</LD>
<LD>   It was not immediately clear whether American troops were directly
involved in the attack in the city of Khost, east of where Operation
Anaconda was staged. The operation ended earlier this week, but U.S.
forces said they were continuing to pursue any remaining Al Qaeda
fighters that might have escaped from the battle zone.</LD>
<LD>   "Last night, terrorists using machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades
and mortars attacked coalition forces in Khost. We returned fire and
continue to develop the situation as we speak," said Army Maj. Bryan
Hilferty, spokesman for the 10th Mountain Division, from Bagram air base
north of Kabul, the capital.</LD>
<TE>   Hilferty said he was not immediately aware of any casualties. He would
not say how many U.S.-allied troops were in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan Islamic Press, based in Peshawar, Pakistan, reported that
militants using heavy machine guns and rockets attacked two U.S. bases in
Khost.</TE>
<TE>   The news agency said one attack occurred at Khost airport southeast of

<LD>The youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto went on trial today,
accused in the murder of a Supreme Court judge who had ruled against him.</LD>
<LD>   Hutomo Mandala Putra, better known as Tommy, was handcuffed when he
appeared in the Central Jakarta District Court. He said nothing as he
made his way into the building surrounded by a crowd of lawyers,

<TE>   The younger Suharto went into hiding six weeks later, and while he was
on the run, four men on two motorcycles shot Kartasasmita to death.</TE>

Tuesday morning in Tijuana, raising fears that a bloody war for control
over the drug-smuggling corridor on the U.S.-Mexico border may be
underway.</LD>
<LD>   Although the three victims, whose ages were believed to be between 30

similarities with past drug killings.</LD>
<LD>   The victims had apparently been tortured. At least one was found with
a plastic bag over his head, and the men's arms and legs were bound with
gray duct tape. One of the dead had two bullet wounds, and the other two
had apparently been beaten to death, Tijuana law enforcement sources
said.</LD>
<TE>   A nervous Tijuana was rattled by gunfire Tuesday afternoon in the
middle-class Los Olivos neighborhood, scene of past violent exchanges and
killings. The gunfire was near the exclusive Hipodromo and Chapultepec
areas, where the Arellano Felix cartel recruited many of its young
assassins--called "narco juniors"--from the Tijuana elite.</TE>
<TE>   Police released few details, saying only that two people were injured
by gunfire, one critically.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of the executed men were found in different parts of
Tijuana between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, city officials from Medellin, Colombia, arrived in
Tijuana on Tuesday to propose that the two cities racked by drug violence
become sister cities. Tijuana Mayor Jesus Gonzalez Reyes said he was
receptive to the idea, saying Medellin had overcome the stigma of being a
"cartel" town and that its experience "will help us because Tijuana and
its people do not deserve to be thought of as such."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have been anticipating a battle for control of the border
drug corridor since the family-dominated Arellano Felix cartel of Tijuana
was hit with a one-two punch: the arrest of Benjamin Arellano Felix on
March 9 and the death of his brother Ramon on Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The battle could pit the remaining members of the clan against the
forces of Ismael Zambada, a violent Sinaloa state smuggler long aligned
with the Juarez cartel who has been trying to make inroads in Baja
California state in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Baja California authorities suspect Zambada of ordering the slaying of
Tijuana Police Chief Alfredo de la Torre in 2000 and of Tijuana attorney
Joaquin Baez Lugo, who reportedly had represented Arellano Felix
interests, in November 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Baez's law associate Rodolfo Carrillo Barragan was gunned down in his
condominium parking garage March 11, two days after Benjamin Arellano
Felix's arrest in Puebla in central Mexico.</TE>

<LD>Robbers stole more than $3 million from a van Tuesday at Heathrow
Airport in the second major theft there since heavy security measures
were imposed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.</LD>
<LD>   British government ministers demanded an urgent report from airport
operator BAA PLC, which is responsible for stopping unauthorized
personnel from getting into restricted zones.</LD>
<LD>   The robbers entered a restricted area where airplanes are parked early
Tuesday and confronted the driver of an armored van at knifepoint just
after the $3.2 million in cash was unloaded from a South African Airways
jet, Scotland Yard said.</LD>
<TE>   It said two young men forced the driver to take them to Cranford,
about two miles away, and then drove off with the cash in another
vehicle. The driver was not hurt.</TE>

<HD>Antarctic Ice Shelf Fast Collapsing, Scientists Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>A large Antarctic ice shelf in an area that is warming faster than
the global average has collapsed with "staggering" rapidity, British
scientists said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The shelf designated as Larsen B, 650 feet thick and with a surface
area of 1,250 square miles, has collapsed into small icebergs and
fragments, the British Antarctic Survey said.</LD>
<LD>   The collapse was first detected on satellite images this month by Ted
Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of
Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   "In 1998, BAS predicted the demise of more ice shelves around the
Antarctic Peninsula," said David Vaughan, a glaciologist at the British
Antarctic Survey.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew what was left [of Larsen B] would collapse eventually, but
the speed of it is staggering. Hard to believe that 500 [quadrillion, or
500,000,000,000,000,000] tons of ice sheet has disintegrated in less than
a month," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by 4.5
degrees Fahrenheit, much faster than average global warming, the BAS
said. As a result, five ice shelves have retreated. The peninsula is
nearest to southern Argentina and Chile.</TE>
<TE>   In January, however, the journal Science reported that new
measurements showed the ice in West Antarctica was thickening, reversing
earlier estimates that the sheet was melting.</TE>

<HD>Serb Official Quits in Spy Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Momcilo Perisic quit Tuesday over a
spy scandal that sparked a dispute with Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Perisic, army chief during much of the rule of Slobodan Milosevic,
Yugoslavia's former president, accepted a request from Serbian Prime
Minister Zoran Djindjic to resign and waive his parliamentary immunity to
allow a full investigation of the affair. Serbia is the main republic in
Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   Army police arrested Perisic on Thursday together with a U.S. diplomat
in a restaurant near Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital, and
accused the deputy prime minister of passing secret military documents.
The diplomat was released Friday, Perisic a day later.</LD>
<TE>   Perisic insisted that he was innocent but was stepping down to prevent
the entire Serbian government from coming under pressure to quit. He said
he had been set up by his political opponents "in the style of the
darkest dictatorial regimes."</TE>
<TE>   "I will not let them use their showdown with me to topple the Serbian
government at a moment when it represents the only possibility for
carrying out economic and political reforms in the country," Perisic
wrote in his resignation letter.</TE>
<TE>   Perisic did not name those he blamed. But the incident has become the
latest in a long line of disputes between Djindjic and his government on
one side, and Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and his supporters on
the other.</TE>
<TE>   The two leaders joined forces to topple Milosevic in October 2000 but
have rarely seen eye to eye since then.</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic has said the arrest was an attempt to discredit his
government.</TE>

<HD>Commonwealth Suspends Zimbabwe for Electoral Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>The Commonwealth stopped short of expelling Zimbabwe on Tuesday but
decided to suspend the southern African nation from its councils for a
year because of the "high level of politically motivated violence" during
its recent election.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means no Zimbabwean representative may take part in any
meeting of the 54-nation grouping of Britain and its former colonies in
the coming year.</LD>
<LD>   "This issue will be revisited in 12 months," Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said.</LD>
<TE>   Howard, chairman of a troika of Commonwealth leaders who met in London
on Tuesday, noted that the organization's observers concluded that the
March 9-11 election that gave President Robert Mugabe another six-year
term had not allowed for a free expression of the wishes of the
electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Other independent observer groups also said the balloting, which
followed preelection violence, was rigged to ensure Mugabe's reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's unanimous decision was made by Howard, South African
President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo.
Industrialized nations of the Commonwealth had called for Zimbabwe's
expulsion, but Tuesday's decision was probably the result of a compromise
with African nations.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe was declared the winner of the election with 56% of votes.</TE>

<LD>U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson blamed outlawed paramilitary

<LD>   Saying the deterioration in the human rights situation was "grave,

<LD>   "The activities of paramilitary groups constituted the main cause of

<HD>How Many More Coffins? Parents Ask</HD>
<DH>New York: Israelis and Palestinians who lost children plead
together for peace. More than 1,000 empty caskets mark Mideast conflict's
deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>More than 1,000 wooden caskets, each draped with an Israeli or
Palestinian flag, filled the block-long plaza outside U.N. headquarters
Tuesday, as parents of victims on both sides of the Middle East conflict
joined in a plea for peace.</LD>
<LD>   "Whoever has lost his son has lost his future," Khaled Mohammed Abdel
Khadir, a West Bank schoolteacher, said in halting English to a knot of
reporters and passersby who paused at the plaza.</LD>
<LD>   His 21-year-old son, Firas, was killed by Israeli forces last month in
circumstances that remain unclear, Khadir said. He said he had traveled
to New York to urge the United Nations and the United States to get
Israelis and Palestinians negotiating again.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost, but we do not want anyone else to lost his sons," Khadir
said, looking at the rows of empty coffins.</TE>
<TE>   The symbolic depiction of the deaths from the last 18 months of
conflict was organized in part by Israeli-Palestinian Bereaved Families
for Peace, a group dating to the first intifada against Israeli rule,
which ended in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   As vocal partisans of nonviolence and reconciliation, neither the
Palestinians nor the Israelis here are representative of their broader
communities--an estrangement they painfully but readily acknowledge. A
joint Israeli-Palestinian peace demonstration might be possible in New
York, but it is almost unthinkable in the current climate in Tel Aviv or
the West Bank city of Ramallah, they say.</TE>
<TE>Israeli's Daughter Killed in 1996 Suicide Bombing</TE>
<TE>   But the Israelis and Palestinians here say they believe that the
majority on both sides accepts that the conflict can be resolved only by
the mutual recognition of two peacefully coexisting states, Israel and
Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what will be the end, but the question is, how many coffins
we will be until that time?" said teacher Ayalet Shahak, whose daughter,
Chen, was killed by a Palestinian suicide bomber in Tel Aviv six years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Chen would have celebrated her 21st birthday Tuesday, Shahak said as
he pulled out a book of "peace poems" his daughter had written shortly
before her death. "This is the day she was born," he said. "It is so
symbolic we are carrying out her will."</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrations for one cause or another are common outside the United
Nations, but Tuesday's protest was received more formally and
respectfully than most. The U.N. undersecretary-general for political
affairs, Kieran Prendergast, addressed the group and delivered a message
from Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "The sight of these coffins brings no solace, and perhaps fresh
sorrow, to the families of the victims," Annan said in the message. "But
the symbolism and the loss they represent should bring wisdom to the two
communities and their leaders, and spur the rest of us to do all we can
to bring an end, once and for all, to this long season of tears."</TE>
<TE>   And although this was an event staged for cameras, the tears and
embraces of the Israeli and Palestinian parents were real. The backdrop
of long rows of caskets kept the mood subdued and somber.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a devastating sight," Prendergast said later. "It was quite
poignant."</TE>
<TE>   There were precisely 1,050 mock coffins in the plaza--250 covered with
Israeli flags and 800 with Palestinian banners--in a count that
approximated the confirmed death toll from the conflict when the
demonstration was planned.</TE>
<TE>   By now, the number of victims in the fighting since September 2000 has
climbed to 353 Israelis and 1,215 Palestinians, by Associated Press
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli and Palestinian parents signed an open letter to Annan and
President Bush on Tuesday imploring them to intervene in the conflict.
"It is too late to save our children," they said. "But please do
everything in your power to bring our leaders to the negotiating table.
Tell them they must stop shooting and start talking."</TE>
<TE>Israeli, Palestinian Flags Intermingled</TE>
<TE>   But their real audience, organizers admitted, was not in New York or
Washington but back home.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis and Palestinians rarely see people from both sides standing
together cordially, and it is rarer still for them to be heard pleading
together for peace.</TE>
<TE>   The most startling image of the day, however, was that of the hundreds
of Israeli and Palestinian flags intermingled, symbolically, in death, as
they rarely are in life.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is for this to be seen on Israeli
television, or at least on CNN, and [pan-Arab network] Al Jazeera too,"
said Yitzhak Frankenthal, director of the Parents' Circle, the Israeli
co-organizer of the demonstration. "We have to get people's attention,
make them stop and think."</TE>

<HD>FBI Unveils Reforms After McVeigh Audit</HD>
<DH>Government: The agency will change procedures and punish agents,
its chief says. Lawmakers may seek more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The FBI announced major changes Tuesday in the way it maintains
confidential case files and pledged to teach agents a "new way of doing
business," in response to an internal investigation that faults the
bureau for mishandling documents in the Oklahoma City bombing case.</LD>
<LD>   FBI Director Robert Mueller also said the agency "will quickly move to
take any appropriate disciplinary actions" against a handful of
supervisors who were singled out by the Justice Department's inspector
general for nearly letting Timothy J. McVeigh's execution proceed without
turning the entire case file over to prosecutors and defense lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   But on Capitol Hill, some lawmakers who oversee federal law
enforcement said the Oklahoma City case is just the latest in a string of
FBI miscues, and that the bureau must work harder to clean up its
operation.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a senior member of the Judiciary
Committee, warned that "it's time for the FBI to take the [inspector
general's] advice. That means swift and sure action that holds
accountable the people who are responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Along with citing human error for the document debacle, the report
found that many records were destroyed by FBI agents before lawyers in
the case were notified and while McVeigh was still appealing his
execution.</TE>
<TE>   McVeigh was tried and convicted in 1997 for the bombing two years
earlier of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. In January 2001, he
abruptly dropped all legal appeals and told the federal court he wanted
to die.</TE>
<TE>   That same month, FBI field offices began discovering files in the case
that had never been turned over to the lawyers. Bureau supervisors
continued to collect previously undisclosed material for the next five
months. In May, just days before McVeigh was to be executed, they alerted
FBI headquarters in Washington that more than 4,000 new pages had been
unearthed.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures led Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to delay McVeigh's
execution while defense attorneys reviewed the documents. McVeigh was put
to death about a month after his original execution date.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators conducted more than 200 interviews and visited 13 FBI
field offices, determining that poor supervision, rather than just an
antiquated computer system, caused the delay in turning over the files.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said some of the improvements are underway.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been making major changes that both implement the
recommendations, address the cultural and training issues inherent in a
new way of doing business, and address the larger issue of records
management as a priority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the changes, he said, is making record-keeping a "core function"
of the FBI's mission. "This has not been the case in past years," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also will overhaul its computer functions and begin training
agents to use new technology "in our everyday way of doing business." His
hope, Mueller said, was that the change would move the agency "out of the
paper environment that was so vexing in the OKBOMB situation."</TE>
<TE>   In short, he added, "records management and integrity are core
functions that demand the same level of attention and accountability as
any function we undertake. It must be a part of our culture."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has sought repeatedly to tighten control over
the FBI and overhaul the bureau's management practices. But the agency
has been embarrassed by stumbles in a series of high-profile cases,
including the Robert Philip Hanssen spy probe and the arrest of Wen Ho
Lee, who worked at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1997, as the McVeigh jury was being selected, the
inspector general sharply criticized the bureau for problems in its
forensic lab related to myriad cases, including the Oklahoma City bombing
and the Unabomber investigation. That investigation prompted the FBI to
build a new laboratory and seek outside accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, in response to criticism from Capitol Hill and elsewhere,
Ashcroft gave department watchdogs expanded powers to investigate
allegations of misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's report said agents took too long to collect the new
documents before alerting the lawyers in the case, and that FBI
headquarters also was slow in responding.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the report noted, some agents destroyed documents because
they believed they were irrelevant, even though that was in violation of
a federal court order that called for full disclosure in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation also faulted supervisors for mistakes in the
Oklahoma City case, primarily Danny Defenbaugh, the inspector in charge
of the case who later became head of the Dallas field office, and Mark
White, a supervisory special agent on the case now assigned to Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation concluded that Defenbaugh and White "did not
effectively manage the review process of the OKBOMB documents" and that
neither supervisor "set any deadlines or timetables" in reviewing the new
records even though McVeigh's execution was fast approaching.</TE>
<TE>   "They failed to notify the prosecutors or anyone at FBI headquarters
about the potential problem until May 7, approximately oneweek before the
scheduled execution date," the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe their failure to take timely action to resolve, or report,
the problem of the belated documents was a significant neglect of their
duties, and we recommend that the FBI consider discipline for these
failures."</TE>
<TE>   To a lesser extent, the report said, Special Agent William Teater in
Oklahoma City "did not adequately supervise the document review project"
and that FBI headquarters did not properly communicate with the field
offices on who was to blame for the delays.</TE>
<TE>   FBI headquarters, the report said, "contributed to confusion within
the agency."</TE>
<TE>   Defenbaugh said Tuesday that he respected the findings, but he added:
"I made decisions concerning the documents based on my honest evaluation
of the situation, my many years of experience, and out of my desire to do
the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the inquiry was the largest domestic terrorism case
handled by the FBI, calling it "a Herculean task to say the least."</TE>
<TE>   In his interview with investigators, Defenbaugh was quoted in the
report as saying he should have sped the process for turning over the
documents as the clock wound down on McVeigh's execution.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "If I was gonna blow the whistle and stop the juice from
flowing, I was gonna make sure that we were right and I was thorough."</TE>
<TE>   White, who could not be reached for comment, told investigators he did
not believe collecting the new materials was his responsibility, and that
he acted more as a consultant to fixing the problem once the additional
documents were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Teater told investigators he tried to get his supervisors to speed the
document collection process. He declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Study Sees Wider Use for Heart Implant</HD>
<DH>Health: The device might save 24,000 lives a year, research says,
but could cost $60,000 apiece.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Implantable devices that shock a faltering heart back into proper
rhythm could potentially save 24,000 lives per year by preventing
repeated heart attacks, according to a major new study.</LD>
<LD>   But the devices, similar to the one used by Vice President Dick
Cheney, come at considerable cost--as much as $60,000 each, including the
cost of implant surgery. They could add more than $1 billion to the
national health care bill if they were used by all patients who would
benefit.</LD>
<LD>   The devices, called implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs,
already have proved valuable in treating patients who have abnormal heart
rhythms, the problem Cheney suffers from.</LD>
<TE>   The new study broadens their application to a much larger group. The
devices could be used in 200,000 to 400,000 new patients every year.
There is also a backlog of existing heart attack patients--perhaps as
many as 2 million--who could also benefit from the devices. The study
indicates they would reduce heart attack death rates among all such
patients by nearly one third.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important and major contribution to the field, as it sets
new standards for therapy to save lives and improve survival," said Dr.
Arthur J. Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, who led the
study. "It's like having your own personal coronary care unit."</TE>
<TE>   The primary drawback is the expense. The devices cost about $20,000
each, and the surgery can be double or even triple that figure. Fearing
the cost, some critics are resisting widespread use.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too soon to make sweeping recommendations without considering
the increased costs," said Dr. David Faxon, president of the American
Heart Assn. "The next step is to narrow in on the type of patient who
would benefit most, maximizing the benefits while keeping costs low."</TE>
<TE>   Moss' team acknowledged that the cost to implant the devices in all
eligible patients "would be substantial."</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that market forces will drive down the cost of this therapy,"
they said in presenting the results.</TE>
<TE>   Moss presented the results Tuesday at an Atlanta meeting of the
American College of Cardiology. The report also will be published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, but the journal is making the
paper immediately available online at http://www.nejm.org.</TE>
<TE>   Moss and his colleagues studied 1,232 patients who had suffered a
heart attack, whose hearts were working at less than half the normal
rate. Heart functioning was determined by the ejection fraction--a
measure of how much blood the heart pumps with each contraction. Normal
is about 60% or higher; the patients studied had ejection fractions of
30% or lower.</TE>
<TE>   People who have such low ejection fractions have generally had several
heart attacks, Moss said, and often have other complicating factors, such
as diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Previous studies have shown that patients with ejection fractions of
30% or lower--about one-quarter of all heart attack victims--have an
increased risk of sudden heart attacks caused by abnormal electrical
stimulation of the heart. ICDs monitor those electrical impulses and
shock the heart when necessary to restore normal rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   All 1,232 patients received conventional drug therapy for their
condition; 742 also received an implantable defibrillator.</TE>
<TE>   After an average of 20 months, 19.8% of those receiving only medical
therapy had died, compared to 14.2% of those with defibrillators--a
decrease of about 30%. That rate of improvement in survival was the
biggest since the introduction of the beta-blocker heart drugs in the
1970s, Moss said.</TE>
<TE>   The results were so good that an independent monitoring agency
terminated the study prematurely last Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers had expected that the devices would provide a benefit, but
"the very dramatic results were surprising," said Dr. Noelle Langan of
Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Those patients receiving the ICDs did have a somewhat higher rate of
new or worsened heart failure. But the researchers could find no evidence
that the devices were damaging the heart, Moss said. The cause of the
problem is more likely to be that the patients are living longer and
therefore have more opportunity to get sick, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moss said his team is now reexamining the data to determine if there
is some way to predict which patients would be most likely to benefit
from ICDs, allowing physicians to limit the use of the devices.</TE>
<TE>   The study was sponsored by Guidant Corp. of Indianapolis, which
manufactures the device used in the trial. Medtronic Inc. and St. Jude
Medical Inc. also sell ICDs.</TE>
<TE>   About 80,000 ICDs were implanted in the United States in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Bush Pushes Bill Allowing Illegal U.S. Residents to Stay</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Senior Democrat argues that the approach poses a
security risk. Senate passage is unlikely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With a trip to Mexico set for later this week, President Bush on
Tuesday urged the Senate to act quickly to allow thousands of foreigners
to seek legal residence even though they are in the United States
illegally, saying such action would demonstrate America's compassion.</LD>
<LD>   But Senate scheduling conflicts and strong opposition from a senior
Democrat make the chances appear slim that the Democratic-controlled
chamber will comply with Bush's wishes. As a result, the president
apparently will be deprived of a popular initiative to tout Friday while
attending an international aid conference in Monterrey.</LD>
<LD>   As he pleaded with the Senate to enact the measure, which the
Republican-controlled House passed last week, Bush noted that it contains
an array of provisions designed to enhance homeland security, such as
requiring more foolproof identification documents and greater monitoring
of foreign students.</LD>
<TE>   The immigration measure would allow thousands of people who either
entered the United States illegally or overstayed their visas to remain
in this country with their families while completing paperwork to obtain
a green card, which entitles them to settle in the United States. To
begin this process, the applicants would have to pay a $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Without a congressional exemption, such immigrants must return to
their homelands to file an application, and face a potential wait of up
to 10 years before they may return.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, Bush said, would mean the immigrants "won't have to leave
the country, apply, and then come back to be with their family. We
believe in family values. We believe good policy keeps families
together."</TE>
<TE>   Bush added, "I want to show our friends, the Mexicans, that we are
compassionate" about not wanting to disrupt families that are a mix of
legal and illegal residents.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would apply only to foreigners who had obtained a
qualifying sponsor--through employment with a U.S. company, for example,
or marriage to a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident--before Aug.
15, 2001. Such persons would have until Nov. 30 to apply for an
exemption.</TE>
<TE>   The border security provisions in the bill would require schools to
report when a foreign student does not show up for classes and that
passports and visas issued by other nations contain "biometric
information," such as fingerprints or retina scans.</TE>
<TE>   A key foe of the measure is Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), who in a
floor speech this week denounced the immigration provision as amounting
to "amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, many of whom
have not undergone any, any, background or security check."</TE>
<TE>   Such an approach "poses a dangerous risk to our border security," Byrd
added, noting that three of the Sept. 11 hijackers were in the U.S. on
expired visas.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, first elected to the Senate in 1958, indicated he would thwart
any attempt to vote on the bill this week.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) held out little prospect
of a quick vote, saying Tuesday he was hopeful the Senate would take up
the immigration matter upon returning in April from its spring recess.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer seemed to suggest that the
Senate had its priorities mixed up, noting that the chamber is working on
campaign finance reform--an issue he said does not have the immediate
impact the immigration measure does because it would not take effect
until after the November elections.</TE>
<TE>   But when pressed, Fleischer said the White House was not suggesting
that the Senate put aside the campaign finance bill to take up
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   After his stop in Mexico, Bush will visit Peru and El Salvador.</TE>

<HD>Acting Gov. Swift Will Pass on Uphill Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing a soaring budget gap and sagging poll numbers, acting Gov.
Jane Swift dropped out of the Massachusetts governor's race Tuesday.
Within hours, Mitt Romney, fresh from his high-profile leadership at the
Winter Olympics, announced he would enter the contest.</LD>
<LD>   "I am announcing this afternoon my decision to end my campaign as
governor," Swift, a Republican, said at a news conference in Boston. "I
believe this is in the best interest of my state."</LD>
<LD>   The acting governor said she decided to step aside because the
economic slowdown had complicated the job and the prospect of running
against Romney, who was both wealthy and popular, would make the race
even more demanding.</LD>
<TE>   She said the twin pressures of her office plus campaigning would cut
into "non-negotiable" time with her family. "The reality, and I'm sure
there isn't a working parent in America that hasn't faced it, is that
when the demands of the two tasks that you take on both increase
substantially, something has to give," said Swift, the mother of three
young children.</TE>
<TE>   Romney didn't formally announce for the job, but he made his
intentions absolutely clear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in. The bumper stickers are being printed and the Web site is
going up," he said on the front lawn of his home in the Boston suburb of
Belmont. "The campaign papers have been filed today."</TE>
<TE>   Swift's decision was unexpected, though speculation that Romney, the
head of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, might run clearly had hurt
her fund-raising abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Her announcement also was embarrassing for two of her most prominent
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, former Gov. Wlliam F. Weld backed Swift in the race,
stating his "unequivocal support and admiration."</TE>
<TE>   Former Sen. Edward W. Brooke also had announced his backing.</TE>
<TE>   Swift, who said she made her decision late Monday, took office last
April when the Bush administration named Gov. Paul Cellucci as ambassador
to Canada. At the age of 37, she became the first female chief executive
in the history of the Bay State and the nation's youngest governor.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, she proclaimed she was unfazed by the possibility of
Romney's entry into the contest. But a poll showed Swift trailing the
wealthy 55-year-old businessman by as much as 60 points among likely
Republican voters.</TE>
<TE>   Romney's father, George, served three terms as governor of Michigan
and sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Swift's withdrawal left Romney as the only Republican contender. The
crowded field of Democrats includes Robert B. Reich, the former secretary
of Labor in the Clinton administration; Massachusetts state Treasurer
Shannon O'Brien; Steve Grossman, a businessman; and Warren Tolman, a
former state legislator.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to be a very tough, rough-and-tumble campaign," Romney
said in a phone interview with reporters. "I have five Democratic
opponents. They will be working collectively to make me enemy No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was surprised by Swift's decision and neither he nor his
staff had been in contact with her or her supporters.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, officials said neither President Bush nor any of
his political advisors was involved Swift's decision not to run.</TE>
<TE>   Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the administration learned of the
decision Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls showed that only about 25% of voters approved of Swift's
handling of her office. She was especially criticized for using her staff
as baby sitters.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Romney ran a strong race against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. And
even though he headed the Salt Lake Olympic organizing effort, he kept
his Massachusetts base.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders said the Olympic Games had only increased his visibility
among voters in Massachusetts and had provided him with an invaluable
springboard for the election in November.</TE>

<HD>Bush Likely to OK Merger of INS, Customs Into 1 Border Agency</HD>
<DH>Terror: President's aides endorse the plan, which will need
congressional approval. Idea had languished for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The White House is nearing a decision on merging the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and the Customs Service in a bid to better
protect the nation's borders and enhance homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush was reviewing the plan, which has been endorsed by his
top advisors. Aides said Tuesday that he is expected to accept the
recommendation, possibly within the next few days. The plan, which
requires congressional approval, would be a significant move to reshape
the government's border security functions after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, the Justice Department would probably oversee the new
border security agency. The Customs Service is part of the Treasury
Department, and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill reportedly has
endorsed the idea.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department already oversees the INS, which the
administration is overhauling after years of gaffes and charges of
incompetence. The immigration service most recently came under fire when
it notified a Florida flight school that two of the terrorist hijackers
had been granted legal status to study in the United States--six months
after their suicide attacks on the World Trade Center. The Border Patrol
is the law enforcement arm of the INS.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the merger contend that it would reduce red tape, save
money and enhance the government's ability to regulate border crossings
at a time of heightened concern about terrorism. Recommendations to
combine the agencies have been offered--and have languished--for years
but found a new champion in Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, along
with others in the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "A recommendation has been received by the president that would merge
some agencies in a way that would help enforce the borders more tightly,"
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters Tuesday. "The
president is always looking at ways to strengthen the border. . . . It's
a very important priority."</TE>
<TE>   INS Commissioner James W. Ziglar declined to comment Tuesday on the
proposal, saying only that he fully supports the president.</TE>
<TE>   The INS is responsible for regulating the entry of foreigners into the
United States, and the Customs Service officials monitor the flow of
goods into this country. Officials of both agencies typically staff posts
along the borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as U.S. entry points
inside airports and seaports.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction on Capitol Hill to the latest merger plan was wary, as
lawmakers awaited further details. But Democratic leaders suggested
Tuesday that such a proposal would face tough scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important for us to be very deliberate," said Sen.
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). "I want to make sure that we have
the best possible enforcement mechanism and the best agency to deal with
all of the complexities that we're facing with regard to border security.
And I'm not sure this is the answer."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, sounded even more wary.</TE>
<TE>   "If moving these boxes around on a flow chart amounts to change for
the sake of change, then we will not come close to solving the real
problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is especially important to take a good hard look when something
springs from an impulse to just do something--anything--to solve a
problem. Congress and our committee will ask the tough questions to see
if this is the right answer," Leahy said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for House Judiciary Committee Chairman James F.
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) said the chairman was waiting for further
details before commenting. "It's certainly something that we'd be very
much interested in," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Canadian officials reached agreement in December to more
closely coordinate their regulation of America's northern border,
including plans for greater sharing of intelligence and information about
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration hopes to reach a similar border accord with
Mexico later this week when Bush travels to a U.N. conference in
Monterrey, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation comes as Bush prepares for a four-day trip to Latin
America, including Mexico. The trip begins Thursday with a stop in El
Paso, where Bush is expected to discuss border issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Jurisdictions are divided over many agencies for how to enforce our
borders," Fleischer said. "And there's a school of thought that you can
have better controls and more effective ways of welcoming people to this
country, welcoming trade to this country, while keeping people out who
would do us harm, as a result of consolidation."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Analyst Pleads Guilty to Spying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. intelligence analyst who revealed the identities of four
undercover agents to Cuban officials pleaded guilty Tuesday to espionage.
She could spend 25 years in federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   Ana Belen Montes, 45, was spying for Cuba from the time she started
work at the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1985 until her arrest on Sept.
21, prosecutors say.</LD>
<LD>   By that time, she was a senior intelligence analyst and had used
shortwave radio and coded pager messages to give Cuba U.S. secrets so
sensitive they could not be fully described in court documents.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, those statements are true and accurate," Montes told U.S.
District Judge Ricardo Urbina after the charges were read.</TE>
<TE>   When Urbina asked whether one reason she had agreed to plead guilty
was "the fact that you committed the crime," Montes replied, "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Roscoe Howard Jr., U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said
law enforcement officials did not know whether any of the information
Montes transmitted to Cuba was shared with other countries. However, the
Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington heightened the need to "get
her off the streets," and influenced the timing of her arrest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Howard added that, to the government's knowledge, Montes received only
nominal payments for expenses. He would not speculate on her motivation.</TE>
<TE>   The four undercover agents whose identities she revealed, Howard said,
are safe.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plea agreement, Montes would accept a sentence of 25 years
in prison with no possibility of parole, followed by five years of
supervised release. In exchange, Howard said, the government would get
her full cooperation in disclosing all information she may have about
criminal activity regarding herself or others with whom she may have
worked. Urbina set a sentencing date for Sept. 24.</TE>

<HD>Denver Takes On Police Profiling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>Denver's mayor ordered city police on Tuesday to stop gathering
information on residents based on ethnicity, religion or politics, a
largely symbolic rebuke following revelations the department kept
thousands of secret files on peaceful protest groups for years.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Wellington Webb told the Denver Police Department to incorporate
a City Council resolution curbing police powers into its internal policy
manual by the end of the day.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution, passed by the Denver City Council on a 7-4 vote Monday
night, states that police should not gather information on people or
groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender or
sexual orientation without probable cause that crimes had been committed.</LD>
<TE>   The measure was pushed by civil libertarians, who were acting in
response to the USA Patriot Act of 2001, which Congress passed last fall
in the wake of the Sept. 11 hijacking attacks in New York, Virginia and
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The act gives law enforcement officials broader authority to conduct
surveillance and searches, and deport suspected terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   While Denver is not the first city to oppose the new federal law--San
Francisco, San Jose and Portland, Ore., have passed similar measures--the
resolution came on the heels of disclosures last week that Denver police
have kept intelligence files on peaceful protest groups for years.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Morris of the All Nations Alliance, the organization that
proposed the resolution, said the measure would reinforce internal police
policies that prohibit racial profiling, which he said police ignored
while spying in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "This reaffirms that police need to get their house in order and see
the importance of abiding by the policy of the city," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union displayed leaked police
records showing Denver police had been keeping thousands of files on
peaceful protest groups.</TE>

<LD>Panamanian Gen. Manuel A. Noriega asked for early parole Tuesday at
a hearing in the U.S. prison in Miami where he is serving a drug
trafficking sentence, but his lawyer said it was "highly doubtful" his
2007 release date would be moved up.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Parole Commission does not release details of parole
hearings. But Noriega's lawyer, Frank Rubino, who attended, said Noriega
pointed out in his parole request that he had been "a model prisoner."</LD>
<LD>   Rubino said he doubted that Noriega would win early parole.</LD>
<TE>   According to Rubino's account of the proceedings, the commission's
examining officer said that, "due to the severity of the crime that the
general was involved in, he would not recommend that he be paroled
early."</TE>
<TE>   The commission typically decides within 21 days whether to grant early
release, a commission official in Washington said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the word is, it's a rubber stamp," Rubino said.</TE>
<TE>   Noriega, a former army commander who ran Panama in the 1980s,
surrendered to U.S. invasion forces in Panama in 1990. He was brought to
Miami to face charges that he allowed Colombian cartels to use Panama as
a transit center for U.S.-bound drugs. He was convicted in 1992 of drug
trafficking, racketeering and money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Now 64, Noriega was initially sentenced to 40 years in prison. A judge
later cut that to 30 years, saying Noriega had served much of his time in
near-solitary confinement and had received a harsher sentence than his
co-defendants.</TE>
<TE>   The United States recognized Noriega as a prisoner of war, which
enables him to wear his military uniform rather than regular prison garb
and to receive visitors from the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   If his parole request is denied, he would next be eligible to ask for
a hearing in March 2004.</TE>

<HD>Election Reformers Sue for Action on Complaint Against Ashcroft</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A campaign overhaul group filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to get
the Federal Election Commission to act on a year-old complaint involving
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint alleges that, in his 2000 Senate reelection campaign,
Ashcroft failed to report a contribution that exceeded federal
fund-raising limits.</LD>
<LD>   The National Voting Rights Institute's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District
Court, asks a judge to order the FEC to rule on the complaint within 30
days. The FEC can dismiss the case, impose civil fines or forward matters
to the Justice Department--which Ashcroft now heads--for criminal
investigation.</LD>
<TE>   FEC spokeswoman Kelly Huff declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Ashcroft center on a mailing list of
contributors developed during Ashcroft's 1998 presidential exploration
effort. One political action committee, Spirit of America, built the
list, and Ashcroft's Senate reelection committee used it to raise more
than $116,000, the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal election rules, donating a mailing list is the same as
making a campaign contribution and is subject to the same $10,000 limit.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Reform Foes Concede Senate Passage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With a crucial Senate vote scheduled for today, campaign finance
legislation appeared headed for final approval as opponents of the
fund-raising reforms conceded the fight in Congress and prepared to do
battle in the courts.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Senate Democrats who support the bill had been gearing up
against their Republican opponents--warning of possible all-night
sessions to counter any stalling maneuvers that could emerge.</LD>
<LD>   But by late Tuesday, most suspense over the bill's fate in the Senate
was vanishing. The only remaining questions were how quickly debate on
the bill would end and what its final margin of passage would be.</LD>
<TE>   The bill would ban the unlimited donations to national political
parties known as soft money, impose new regulations on certain forms of
political advertising and double the amount of money an individual donor
can give directly to a candidate for Congress or president.</TE>
<TE>   If enacted, it would be the broadest overhaul of election law since
the post-Watergate reforms of 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for years the leading opponent of
reform, conceded that the bill would in all likelihood be approved, and
he predicted that President Bush would sign it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be really surprised if he didn't," McConnell told reporters. But
he reiterated that he plans to become the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit
challenging the bill's constitutionality once it becomes law.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the bill's best-known proponent, said
congressional debate would end as early as today. "It's over," he said.
"It's time to close."</TE>
<TE>   The bill the Senate is considering won approval last month from the
House on a 240-189 vote.</TE>
<TE>   The first scheduled vote in the Senate would be on whether to force
final action on the bill. Under Senate rules, that vote will require 60
votes for approval, a margin that both sides say proponents appear to
have. At some point afterward, also probably today, the Senate would then
vote on final passage. That formality, requiring only a simple majority
of 51 senators, would clear Congress to send the bill to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush would then have less than two weeks after receiving the bill to
decide whether to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   In another legislative matter, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) told reporters that Republican and Democratic negotiators were
nearing a breakthrough on separate legislation to overhaul voting
procedures after the 2000 election controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be quite an historic week if in the same week we pass
campaign reform and election reform," Daschle said. "I think that that is
a real possibility."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Independent Counsel May Face Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Robert W. Ray, who resigned last week as Whitewater independent
counsel, may soon find himself under investigation to determine whether
he breached legal restrictions barring partisan political activity by
federal prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, made public on Tuesday letters he wrote to David Walker, head
of the General Accounting Office, and to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft asking
for separate investigations of Ray, who has announced plans to seek the
Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   Ray has strongly denied any impropriety as independent counsel. His
office completed investigations into a failed Arkansas land deal known as
Whitewater and into former President Clinton's relationship with onetime
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.</LD>
<TE>   Even though Ray resigned his office six days after his final report on
the Lewinsky investigation was released this month, Leahy said Ray "may
have engaged in improper political activity" in planning his New Jersey
race while serving as the independent counsel. Ray was sharply critical
in the March 6 report, saying he could have obtained an indictment of
Clinton had Clinton not admitted last year that he had been untruthful.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the GAO, the auditing and investigative arm of
Congress, said the agency must comply with requests from committee
chairmen. But Laura Kopelson said, "It's too early to say how we intend
to respond because we will have to sit down and discuss the matter with
Mr. Leahy."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said that by interviewing consultants and staff for his New
Jersey race and "lining up financial backers," Ray may have violated the
federal Hatch Act as well as Justice Department regulations that apply to
independent counsels. Ray has acknowledged speaking to a Republican
gathering in New Jersey last month.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Ray's 17 months as independent counsel, a post in which
he succeeded Kenneth W. Starr, Leahy said in his letters that "those who
accept the responsibility of such a special appointment . . . must bring
single-minded focus and unassailable impartiality to their investigations
[and] it was that role which Mr. Ray swore an oath to fulfill."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics authority at New York University, said
Ray probably did not breach any regulations unless there is evidence
"that he behaved as a candidate" while still serving as independent
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a fine line and it's not possible to be precise about where
it is," Gillers said. "But I think he'd be allowed to have informal
private conversations with close friends or relatives about running for
office. Such conversations, of course, could not be allowed to influence
his decisions as a prosecutor."</TE>
<TE>   Another ethics authority, Mary M. Cheh at George Washington
University, said an investigation would be useful. "This illustrates the
problems of independent counsels and why the law was not renewed [in
1999]," Cheh said. "It surely violates the spirit of what we thought
these prosecutors were all about."</TE>
<TE>   Ray, a top assistant to Starr before succeeding him, defended his
conduct against charges of politics in a statement posted on his Web
site. His statement followed similar accusations made earlier this month
by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.).</TE>
<TE>   Ray said he had not violated the Hatch Act's prohibition against
political activity "either in letter or spirit." Before his resignation
on March 12, Ray said he had "not filed as a candidate or as a nominee"
and had "not sought or solicited campaign contributions, raised money or
sought or received endorsements."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged attending a Lincoln Day dinner sponsored by the
Monmouth County Republican Club on Feb. 10. "I gave a speech principally
honoring President Abraham Lincoln's birthday because I was asked to do
so [but] I did not appear in support of or in opposition to any
candidate, whether myself or anyone else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As to Justice Department regulations on prosecutors, including
independent counsels, Ray acknowledged being bound "by those policies
respecting enforcement of the criminal laws," adding that counsels may be
removed for "good cause" only by the attorney general.</TE>

<HD>Oral Drug Found Promising as Possible Smallpox Treatment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have developed a drug that could be a useful treatment
in the event of a bioterrorist attack with the deadly smallpox virus.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, which has been tested against smallpox in cell cultures or
on related viruses in animals, can be administered by mouth--an important
attribute for a medicine that might have to be given to many people
quickly.</LD>
<LD>   The findings, which have not yet been published, were presented
Tuesday at a conference in Prague in the Czech Republic. Bioterrorism
experts said the drug could be an important step in developing a
protective arsenal against smallpox. Such drugs, by interfering with the
virus' ability to replicate, would allow victims to survive the disease.</LD>
<TE>   Extinct in nature, the virus still remains in two known
repositories--in the United States and Russia. U.S. intelligence
officials believe smallpox stocks may also exist at other sites from
which they theoretically could be used in a hostile attack.</TE>
<TE>   But the experts stressed that the drug faces many more tests before
its safety and effectiveness against smallpox infections are known. In
addition, they said, a safer vaccine and a better variety of drugs are
needed.</TE>
<TE>   The work is the result of a collaboration between scientists in
California, Maryland, Atlanta and Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   The drug was created after government scientists screened hundreds of
drugs in search of one able to interfere with the way the smallpox virus
reproduces when grown in a cell culture.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists found several candidates, including one--called
cidofovir--which is used to treat certain viral eye infections. That
drug, however, must be injected to be effective.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Karl Hostetler and James Beadle, scientists with the Veterans
Affairs San Diego Healthcare System and UC San Diego, chemically modified
cidofovir so that it could easily be absorbed by the human gut and thus
could be taken orally.</TE>
<TE>   That modified chemical slows the ability of smallpox to reproduce in a
cell culture when given at a far lower dose than that of unmodified
cidofovir, said John Huggins, chief of the department of viral
therapeutics at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases in Ft. Detrick, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The drug also protected mice from cowpox--an infection related to
smallpox that is deadly to mice--when it was given to the animals orally
at the same time they were infected, Huggins said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are developing a vaccine against smallpox that would have
fewer side effects than the current injection. Public health officials
say that is key to protecting against a potential smallpox outbreak.
Effective drugs that could slow infection are important too, said David
Sherman, professor of microbiology at the University of Minnesota Medical
School in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe a vaccine developed against one form of the virus might not
protect against a new form or a diabolically altered form," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   But developing anti-smallpox drugs is a difficult proposition, said
Jonathan B. Tucker, a specialist in chemical and biological weapons with
the Monterey Institute of International Studies and author of "Scourge:
The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the whole dilemma of trying to develop treatments for a disease
that no longer exists in nature," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since smallpox virus does not normally cause disease except in humans,
tests are done with related viruses. These may react somewhat differently
to the drugs than would the smallpox virus.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, said Tucker, it is important that the drug be able to
fight the virus after the subject is infected. Such tests are planned on
mice, Huggins said.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists also hope to test the drug's safety in animals and then
people--as well as its effectiveness in treating eye infections that are
treated with the injectable version of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox is caused by the variola virus, which induces flu-like
symptoms and a characteristic rash..</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Priest Accused of Sexual Abuse Is Working at Another Parish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A priest placed on leave after allegedly molesting a boy at a
parish in 1997 is working at another church, it was disclosed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The priest, the Rev. Henry Mills, is accused in a lawsuit of giving
then-17-year-old Luis Guzman alcohol and engaging in sex acts during
"counseling" sessions from 1992 to 1995. Guzman is seeking more than $100
million in damages.</LD>
<LD>   Mills, who denies the accusations, is assigned to St. Elizabeth Church
in Manhattan, where he celebrates Mass but does not teach at the parish
school, said Msgr. Gerald Walsh, the church's pastor.</LD>
<TE>   Mills was placed on leave from the Bronx parish after the lawsuit was
filed and underwent counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Mills' lawyer, Joseph A. Marra, called the abuse allegations "nothing
more than a grab and a play for money." Mills has counter-sued for
defamation of character and emotional distress, Marra said.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of Mills' duties, first reported by the New York Post, came
after a policy change. The archdiocese said abuse allegations will be
forwarded to authorities if church leaders find probable cause and if the
alleged victim consents.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Cardinal Egan Calls Abuse an 'Abomination'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Facing mounting pressure to speak out against child molestation by
priests, the head of the New York archdiocese condemned sexual abuse as
an "abomination" Tuesday. He said he will send a letter to members of the
diocese explaining how it responds to such accusations.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Edward M. Egan also said he is confident the Bridgeport,
Conn., diocese that he once headed acted appropriately in addressing a
series of sexual abuse cases in the 1990s. The statement was his first in
response to a Hartford Courant report that said Egan allowed priests
accused of sexual abuse to continue working in parishes for many years.</LD>
<LD>   "Sexual abuse of children is an abomination," Egan said. "It leaves
scars on its victims that long endure. My heart goes out to any and all
victims and their families."</LD>
<TE>   The letter, which will discuss "the tragedy and immorality of sexual
abuse," will be distributed to the 2.4 million members of the New York
archdiocese, the nation's third-largest. Spokesman Joseph Zwilling said
he did not know when the letter would be distributed.</TE>
<TE>   The statement came after a week in which church leaders faced mounting
pressure to change their policies on abuse allegations, and on a day in
which details emerged that a New York priest, the Rev. Henry Mills,
accused of sexual abuse, was performing ministerial duties at a Manhattan
church.</TE>
<TE>   Egan did not comment directly on the case involving Mills.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the last week, prosecutors urged church leaders to notify
authorities of all abuse allegations, and state legislators said they
would try to change New York law to require clergy to report abuse
allegations involving clerics.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau said that he
supports strengthening the reporting law. But he said church leaders have
an immediate obligation to report allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Sealed court records showed that Egan, while heading the Bridgeport
diocese, did not notify authorities of abuse allegations and allowed
several priests facing allegations to continue working for many years,
the Courant reported.</TE>
<TE>   Egan left Bridgeport in 2000 to become head of the New York
archdiocese. In his statement, Egan said he would address the matter
further in his letter.</TE>
<TE>   The New York archdiocese said last week it had changed its policy and
would report allegations under certain conditions. Egan reiterated that
stance in his statement.</TE>
<TE>   Future allegations would be forwarded to authorities, the diocese
said, if church leaders find probable cause and if the alleged victim
consents.</TE>
<TE>   Egan said church officials would encourage anyone with a complaint to
notify authorities.</TE>

<HD>Internal Probe Faults Cincinnati Policeman in Shooting</HD>
<DH>Report: Officer mishandled revolver in death of a black teenager
last April that sparked race riots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI
</DL>
<LD>An internal police probe has concluded that a former officer, whose
fatal shooting of an unarmed black man sparked three days of rioting last
year, mishandled his revolver and gave conflicting statements to
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Results of the probe were given to the City Council on Tuesday. If the
officer was still a member of the Cincinnati force, he could be fired
based on the findings, Police Chief Thomas Streicher said.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Roach, 27, who is white, was acquitted of criminal charges in
last April's shooting of 19-year-old Timothy Thomas, who was fleeing
police. The shooting touched off rioting, and led to a federal
investigation of the city's police.</LD>
<TE>   According to the report, Roach told homicide investigators the day of
the shooting that he had believed Thomas to be a threat. Three days
later, Roach said the shooting was an accident, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Under police regulations, an officer cannot put a finger inside his
gun's trigger guard until he has taken aim and is ready to "engage a
threat." Roach must have had his finger on the trigger for the gun to
discharge, investigators concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on Officer Roach's statements and the evidence reviewed, he
imprudently handled his firearm and unintentionally discharged his
firearm when abruptly confronted by Mr. Thomas," the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   Roach, a Cincinnati officer since 1997, quit in January to work for a
suburban police force. He did not return a telephone message left Tuesday
with the Evendale department.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Merlyn Shiverdecker, said he would review the report
with Roach before deciding whether to comment.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing the report, the Rev. Damon Lynch III, who has accused
Cincinnati police of using excessive force against blacks, said: "It's a
travesty of justice."</TE>
<TE>   Streicher said the internal probe began shortly after Roach's
September acquittal. He said results were delayed by Roach's trial, and a
second racially sensitive case involving a black man who died of
asphyxiation after being subdued by police. Two white officers were
cleared last fall in that case.</TE>

<HD>More Rain Due as Residents Assess Flood Damage</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DAYHOIT, Ky.
</DL>
<LD>With even more rain in the forecast, Appalachian residents whose
homes were hit by some of the worst flooding in 25 years returned on
Tuesday to find floors caked with mud and garbage strewn in the trees.</LD>
<LD>   "I just screamed," Kimberly Hammonds said of finding the
fishy-smelling muck up to a foot thick on her carpets, sofas, dining room
tables and even cabinet tops. "That didn't help, but it didn't hurt
anything either."</LD>
<LD>   Rain let up enough to let the flood waters recede and residents return
after as much as 8 inches of rain over two days fell in the hills of
Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia.</LD>
<TE>   The storm was blamed for seven deaths and left hundreds of homes
damaged or destroyed, and rivers hovering menacingly near their banks.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters said more was on the way today, with another storm
expected to deliver 2 inches of rain to a region already soaked.</TE>
<TE>   "Any shower could produce flooding pretty quickly because it's all
runoff now," said National Weather Service forecaster Darrell Massie.</TE>
<TE>   In the string of tiny towns that fill the hollows along eastern
Kentucky's swollen Cumberland, Kentucky and Licking rivers, Tuesday was a
day of misery.</TE>
<TE>   Faye Scott, 68, said she lost everything in her Dayhoit home.
Relatives and neighbors used water hoses and wheelbarrows to clean or
haul away her soggy belongings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally destroyed me," she said, tears welling in her eyes.
"There's so many memories that you just can't salvage."</TE>
<TE>   With every step Jody Ball took, the carpeting under her feet squished
in her mother's mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't be saved," she said. "There's nothing can be done to get the
smell out."</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 homes were damaged or destroyed in eastern Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   In southwestern Virginia, about 1,000 evacuated residents came home to
find the damage inflicted by a 10-foot wall of water that engulfed cars
and carried off sofas.</TE>
<TE>   "It just happened all at once," said Saltville police Sgt. Greg
Hogston. "It was just like--bam! This is the worst I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Hogston said a flood has not caused so much damage in the Smyth County
town of about 2,200 since 1957.</TE>
<TE>   In Tennessee, schools were closed a second day in Sevier County in the
Great Smoky Mountains because of flooding. A 40-foot section of road was
destroyed by a mudslide on Bluff Mountain near Pigeon Forge.</TE>
<TE>   All the reported deaths were in Tennessee, including those of two
people who drowned crossing swollen creeks and four people who died in
rain-related traffic accidents.</TE>

<HD>Texas Inmate Denied Prosthetic Leg for His Upcoming Execution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LIVINGSTON, Texas
</DL>
<LD>A one-legged inmate set to be executed Thursday has requested an
artificial leg so he can walk to the death chamber, but Texas prison
officials said Tuesday he would not get it.</LD>
<LD>   Rodolfo Hernandez, 52, asked for the leg so he could "walk like a man"
to his death by lethal injection in a state prison in Huntsville.</LD>
<LD>   "I came in with two legs, I want to go out with two legs," said
Hernandez, who was condemned to die for killing an illegal immigrant from
Mexico during a 1985 robbery in New Braunfels.</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez lost the leg to diabetes while in prison.</TE>
<TE>   A new leg would cost taxpayers $8,000 and was not considered a medical
necessity, especially two days before Hernandez is set to die, said Texas
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Todd.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be executed without the prosthesis," Todd said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Hernandez would be taken in a wheelchair from his cell to the
death chamber, or if he wanted to walk, crutches would be provided.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez would be the seventh person put to death this year in Texas.</TE>

<HD>Black WWI Vet Gets Posthumous Heroism Medal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Army has agreed to give the Distinguished Service Cross to a
black World War I soldier whose body was recently discovered buried at
Arlington National Cemetery, an Army spokeswoman said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers from New York, who had sought the military's highest honor
for Henry Johnson, responded with federal legislation to permit President
Bush to award him the Medal of Honor.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would also propose a review of the service records of other
black World War I veterans to determine whether they were overlooked for
awards of valor.</LD>
<TE>   It was introduced Tuesday by Democratic Sens. Charles E. Schumer and
Hillary Rodham Clinton; Republican Reps. Benjamin A. Gilman and John E.
Sweeney; Democratic Rep. Michael R. McNulty--all of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, of Albany, N.Y., joined the Army National Guard's "Harlem
Hellfighter" unit during World War I. Because of strict segregation rules
at the time, the black American unit fought under the French in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   On May 14, 1918, Johnson fought off a German raiding party with a
rifle and later with a knife after running out of ammunition. Although
wounded, he was able to rescue a wounded comrade. France awarded Johnson
its highest honor, the Croix de Guerre.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was the first American to receive the French accolade and was
cited by former President Theodore Roosevelt as one of the five bravest
Americans during World War I, New York Gov. George Pataki said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Johnson died in 1929, in his mid-30s, a poor alcoholic undecorated
by his own country. For a long time it was believed that he had never
been recognized in the United States, but records New York officials dug
up as they gathered material to support his application for a Medal of
Honor showed he had received some recognition after returning from
Europe, including riding in a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the state Division of Military and Naval Affairs learned
that Johnson was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. That came as a
surprise to his son, Herman Johnson, 85, of Kansas City, Mo., who always
believed his father had been buried in an unmarked grave underneath the
tarmac at Albany International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Johnson came to the cemetery of heroes with Pataki in
January to decorate his father's grave. Herman Johnson said at the time
he believed racism was in part to blame for the military's failure to
decorate his father.</TE>
<TE>   The Distinguished Service Cross, considered one of nation's highest
military honors, is awarded for extraordinary heroism in combat. It has
been awarded to 12,450 people since it was created in 1918, Army
spokeswoman Elaine Kanellis said.</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't good enough for Johnson, his supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what he did deserves the Medal of Honor," Herman Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill introduced Tuesday, the World War I Veterans Medal of Honor
Justice Act, would let Bush circumvent the Pentagon and award the Medal
of Honor to Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The Medal of Honor process is supposed to begin within two years of a
specific act of heroism. But since Johnson's heroism took place more than
80 years ago, the military has resisted decorating him, Schumer and
Clinton said.</TE>

<HD>In Death, Councilman's Tardy Ways Honored</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WHITEFISH, Mont.
</DL>
<LD>Dr. Chester Hope was late for everything--late coming back from his
lunch hour, late seeing his patients and late getting to City Council
meetings.</LD>
<LD>   "It got to be a pretty big joke with all of us," Mayor Andy Feury
recalled. "I'd say, 'We'll just go ahead and start, Chet will be here in
a few minutes.' "</LD>
<LD>   So to honor Hope, 56, who was shot to death last month, the council
unanimously passed a measure calling for meetings to be held 10 minutes
late.</LD>
<TE>   "During his entire nine-year term," the ordinance says, "Chet Hope was
rarely on time and typically arrived at the council meeting approximately
10 minutes after it had begun. . . . As a lasting memorial to Chet Hope,
the City Council shall convene its regular monthly meetings at 7:10 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Hope and his wife, Carol, a teacher, were shot to death in their home
on Feb. 10 by their eldest son, Jared, 24, who also killed himself. He
had been diagnosed with manic depression.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 people filled the small-town baseball stadium on Feb.
16 for a memorial for the parents and son. All three, Feury said, were
victims of "a disease that took three lives."</TE>
<TE>   "Chet was a remarkable man," fellow Council Member Turner Askew said.
"He fit more life into a day than you could imagine, but the clock wasn't
something that bothered him. Chet was always into something on the far
side."</TE>
<TE>   Hope was an avid hiker and biker, but most of all he was a fishing
fanatic, and temptation flowed all around. The North Fork of the Flathead
River runs by the edge of Columbia Falls, where he and another doctor ran
a clinic for 25 years, and the Whitefish River bisects his hometown of
Whitefish, six miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to be on the fishes' level and watch them and see how they
moved, so he started snorkeling," said Council Member Sarah Fitzgerald.</TE>
<TE>   Hope even ran late for appointments with his patients. His nurses had
to remind him that others were waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good doctor, not just trying to push you through," said
Feury, a patient. "He wanted to know what was going on with you and would
spend a fair amount of time with you in his office."</TE>
<TE>   Hope was defeated for reelection in November, though. Some said it was
his strong support for a proposed hiking and biking path around town that
lost him votes.</TE>
<TE>   Askew said he hopes the city will find a more substantial way to honor
the doctor than starting meetings late.</TE>

<HD>Forest Service Rejects Boy Scouts' Bid for Camp Along River in
Colo.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ASPEN, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Forest Service has halted its review of a proposed Boy
Scout camp along the Fryingpan River, saying the Scouts did not
demonstrate a need for the camp on public land.</LD>
<LD>   "At this point, that isn't the best use of the land there," said
Martha Ketelle, supervisor of the White River National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The search will continue for a location where a new camp can be built,
said Keith Alder, executive for the Western Colorado Council of the Boy
Scouts.</LD>
<TE>   The Fryingpan proposal had been criticized by about 500 opponents who
wrote letters urging the Forest Service to reject the Scouts'
application. They argued the camp would harm the environment and disrupt
an area of the forest that has a scattering of private cabins.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many of the Upper Fryingpan people, we thought it would have
been a disaster to the environmental aspects of that area. This is good
news for those who want to protect the environment," said Paul Darrough,
a former Boy Scout and retired attorney who owns a cabin near the
Fryingpan River Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The Boy Scouts had wanted to locate the camp for as many as 200 on 40
acres of White River National Forest land that had operated as a private
fishing lodge for nearly 100 years.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A major health care workers' union that normally backs Democrats
swung its endorsement Tuesday to Republican Gov. George Pataki's expected
bid for a third term.</LD>
<LD>   The endorsement by Local 1199 of the Service Employees' International
Union was a blow to the two major Democrats seeking to unseat Pataki:
former federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and state Comptroller H.
Carl McCall.</LD>
<LD>   The union represents more than 210,000 workers, mostly in the New York
City area.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, local President Dennis Rivera said Pataki has shown
"an unwavering commitment to the delivery of quality health care."</TE>
<TE>   Pataki, who has not yet formally announced his candidacy, said he was
"proud to have the support of the noble men and women who dedicate their
lives to taking care of others."</TE>
<TE>   Both Democratic candidates had said they expected the endorsement of
Pataki since the state Legislature in January approved a
multibillion-dollar package aimed at raising salaries for health-care
workers. The legislation was negotiated by Pataki and Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   "He bought off the union to get an endorsement," McCall said earlier
this week.</TE>
<TE>   The union represents mainly black and Latino workers and the Puerto
Rican-born Rivera is one of the state's most powerful Latino leaders.</TE>
<TE>   McCall, the only black candidate ever elected to statewide office in
New York, is counting heavily on minority voter support for his
candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls have shown Cuomo, son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and
McCall running about even for the Democratic nomination, but with Pataki
holding leads in the 2-to-1 range over either Democrat. The Democratic
primary is Sept. 10.</TE>

<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>Rep. James A. Traficant Jr.'s cross-examination of a key government
witness Tuesday turned into a shouting match with the judge over the
congressman's statements in court.</LD>
<LD>   Although not a lawyer, Traficant (D-Ohio) is defending himself against
charges he accepted gifts and free labor for his political clout and took
kickbacks from his staff.</LD>
<LD>   Testifying for the government, J.J. Cafaro, former owner of U.S.
Aerospace Group, said Monday that he had an employee deliver a cashier's
check for $26,948.18 to Traficant.</LD>
<TE>   The money, Cafaro testified, was part of a phony deal to buy the
congressman's boat in exchange for his helping U.S. Aerospace secure a
government contract. He said Traficant later returned the check for fear
it would appear inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant hasn't commented on the nature of the check, but in an
attempt to erode Cafaro's credibility, asked him if he actually handed
the congressman a book with the check in it. Cafaro denied it.</TE>
<TE>   "You are lying under oath!" Traficant shouted at Cafaro, raising the
ire of U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells, who has repeatedly warned
Traficant that he can only ask questions, not make statements, during
cross-examination of witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   She told the jury to disregard the congressman's statement and
immediately called a recess.</TE>
<TE>   Once the jury left, Traficant shouted at Assistant U.S. Atty. Craig
Morford that he would not be pushed around.</TE>
<TE>   "Congressman, sit down over there," the judge shouted at Traficant,
pointing to the defense table.</TE>
<TE>   Asked outside the courthouse about the outburst, Traficant said: "I
never do anything without a reason. The courtroom is a theater."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors planned to rest their case today.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant denies all 10 counts of bribery, racketeering and tax
evasion, which carry a maximum penalty of 63 years in prison. He also
faces expulsion from the House if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Clinton Aide Among Winners in Ill. Primary</HD>
<DH>Politics: Rahm Emanuel gets Democratic nod for House seat, while
state Atty. Gen. Ryan wins GOP race for governor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Illinois Atty. Gen. Jim Ryan easily won the Republican nomination
Tuesday to succeed scandal-tainted Gov. George Ryan while former Clinton
aide Rahm Emanuel secured the Democratic nod for a Chicago congressional
seat.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic primary for governor was too close to call, with Rep.
Rod R. Blagojevich and former Chicago school chief Paul Vallas in a dead
heat. Democrats were hoping a bribery scandal that haunted Gov. Ryan will
give them a chance to win the governor's seat for the first time since
1972.</LD>
<LD>   With 81% of precincts reporting, Blagojevich had 373,913 votes, or
35%; Vallas had 362,013 votes, or 34%; and former state Atty. Gen. Roland
Burris had 321,618, or 30%.</LD>
<TE>   On the GOP side, Ryan--who is not related to the governor--had 281,081
votes, or 44%; state Sen. Patrick O'Malley had 180,665 votes, or 29%; and
Lt. Gov. Corinne Wood had 171,742 votes, or 27%.</TE>
<TE>   The primary winners face off Nov. 5. Illinois is one of 36 states
holding elections for governor this year and one of 17 states in which
the incumbent is not running.</TE>
<TE>   On Chicago's North Side, Emanuel emerged victorious from a hard-fought
battle with former state Rep. Nancy Kaszak. He should have the edge this
fall in the heavily Democratic district left open when Blagojevich
decided to give up the seat to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great, but most importantly I'm humbled and honored," Emanuel
said. "It's moments like this that you remember all the good and all the
bad but also all the strength you got from people and why you did this."</TE>
<TE>   With 98% of precincts reporting, Emanuel had 45,836 votes, or 50%.
Kaszak had 35,026 votes, or 39%. Six other candidates, including another
former Clinton aide, Pete Dagher, were far behind.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sparring in the governor's race was between Blagojevich
and Vallas, who argued over guns and abortion--even though both support
abortion rights and gun control. Burris even pleaded with his opponents
to pull their negative TV ads in the name of party unity.</TE>
<TE>   All hoped to capitalize on the misfortune of Gov. Ryan, whose
popularity plummeted amid broken campaign promises and a federal
investigation of the swapping of driver's licenses for bribes, which
occurred mostly when Ryan oversaw license bureaus as secretary of state.
Federal prosecutors say about $170,000 in bribe money ended up in the
governor's campaign fund, though he has not been charged with wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the Republican candidates spent much of their time trying to
distance themselves from the GOP governor.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ryan ran ads calling Wood a "full and equal partner" in George
Ryan's administration.</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant governor and O'Malley accused the attorney general of
knowing about the license scandal but doing nothing about it. They also
criticized Jim Ryan over his handling of a 1983 murder case when he was
DuPage County prosecutor. Three men went to prison but were later
released amid questions about the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   After her defeat, Wood said she was proud to have helped expand the
GOP base. She said she showed there is Republican support for abortion
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I am also very proud to be the first Republican woman to seek the
highest office in the state," Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign for the 5th Congressional District, which runs from Lake
Michigan to O'Hare airport, was equally negative. Emanuel, 42, sought
fund-raising help from former President Clinton and Kaszak, 51, called
him a Washington outsider.</TE>
<TE>   The race took a nasty turn two weeks ago amid accusations of
anti-Semitism. A Polish supporter of Kaszak suggested that Emanuel, who
is Jewish, was a citizen of Israel and served for two years in the
Israeli army.</TE>
<TE>   The comments about Emanuel's background are not true and Kaszak
repudiated the remarks. But Emanuel said the remarks reflected a
"whispering campaign" of anti-Semitism against him.</TE>

<HD>BMW Puts Mini Spin on Line of Accessories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BMW's Mini unit expects to find customers even among those who don't
buy its cars.</LD>
<LD>   When the first 50 Mini showrooms open this week, they each will
have a special section devoted to Mini fashions--a line of clothing
and gear featuring the brand's winged logo and designed to "augment
the Mini driving experience," said Rinat Aruh, the company's
lifestyle development manager.</LD>
<LD>   Dealers also will offer a line of automotive fashions--spoilers,
fancier wheels and the like--that customers can order with their
cars.</LD>
<TE>   Jack Pitney, Mini's general manager, said the company borrowed the
concept of lifestyle products marketing from several successful
practitioners: Harley-Davidson, Ferrari and, of course, Mini parent
Bayerische Motoren Werke, which has had a lifestyle products program
for years.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson is the king, reportedly
earning more money each year from Harley-branded clothing,
cigarettes, jewelry and accessories than it does from selling its
famous heavyweight bikes.</TE>
<TE>   BMW's sales of clothing, accessories and toys branded with the
company logo is quite profitable as well, said Martha McKinley, a
spokeswoman for BMW Group Americas in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Because the $17,000-to-$24,000 Mini Cooper and its supercharged
sibling, the Mini Cooper S, will be relatively low-profit cars for
dealers used to bigger margins on BMW vehicles, earnings from
lifestyle products will be an important part of each franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Aruh, a former New York-based marketing manager for Italian
fashion house MaxMara, suggests that a Mini dealership that
aggressively markets the lifestyle products could make as much from
them each month as from the sale of half a dozen Minis.</TE>
<TE>   Items in the 30-page Mini motoring gear catalog range from a $1.50
enamel lapel pin to a $175 cotton-bodied motoring jacket with zip-off
sleeves made of synthetic chamois.</TE>
<TE>   (The jacket's arms zip off to turn the jacket into a vest, and in
a pinch, Aruh said, "you could use them to clean water spots off the
car and then toss them into the washing machine.")</TE>
<TE>   The other line of Mini accessories--dealer-installed dress-up and
performance parts for the vehicles--also promises significantly
bigger profit margins than do the cars, said Pitney, the general
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Among the offerings are license plate frames; gearshift knobs;
American, British and checkered-flag graphics for the Mini's large
rectangular roof; a luggage rack system with interchangeable bicycle,
ski and snowboard holders; a body-styling kit that also comes as
individual pieces; and a plethora of custom wheels.</TE>
<TE>   BMW says U.S. Mini sales are limited by worldwide production
capacity to about 20,000 a year. Because the car is so different from
its mainline products, the German auto maker has chosen to treat Mini
as a separate line.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mini dealers also sell BMWs, they had to agree to spend
as much as $350,000 to build separate showrooms for the Mini.
Customers will know there is a relationship when they go to a
BMW-Mini franchise, but the only place the BMW name will appear on a
Mini is on the manufacturer's identification plate.</TE>
<TE>   Pitney and Aruh intend, however, to make sure the Mini logo is
everywhere.</TE>

<DH>BMW's Mini Cooper returns after a 37-year absence with some
key improvements--and some things that still need improving.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's cute, it's cuddly, it handles like a go-kart, and it's roomy
enough for four full-size people, or two people and a lot of cargo.</LD>
<LD>   It's the Mini Cooper, and it goes on sale in the U.S. in two days.</LD>
<LD>   It has history: The original, introduced in Britain in 1959,
helped start the small-car revolution and half a decade later
inspired designer Mary Quant to name her short-short skirt the
"mini."</LD>
<TE>   It still is built in England, but the company now is owned by BMW.
So you'd suspect that it would be nothing short of a pint-sized
version of that ultimate driving machine the boys from Bavaria always
are bragging about.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, the Mini Cooper comes close. The car, reintroduced after a
37-year absence from the U.S., is a completely redesigned and
re-engineered 2002 model--there was no 2001--that went on sale in
Europe last year. And although it pays strong visual homage to the
Minis of 1959-2000, it shares little mechanically with its
predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   It is a great little package, Teutonically tight and sticky as a
cocklebur even on rain-slicked roads. It undoubtedly--and
deservedly--will win a ton of awards and a flock of fans.</TE>
<TE>   But it also has an engine that could use a shot of low-end torque,
a five-speed manual transmission that ought to be a close-ratio six
speed and a suspension that trades comfort for control.</TE>
<TE>   The Mini, rolling on its standard 15-inch tires and wheels, is a
rough rider, and probably will be uncomfortable for many on
California's increasingly potholed streets and highways. It takes a
$500 upgrade to 16-inch wheels and run-flat tires and an additional
$270 for the more supportive sport seats to start smoothing it out.
And those upgrades turn the $16,850 base model (that price includes a
$550 destination charge) into a $17,620 car.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a car to take on a cross-country trip, but long-
distance drivers aren't expected to figure heavily in the Mini buyer
profile.</TE>
<TE>   As a car for daily commutes--especially for zipping in and out of
city traffic--or for fun weekends, the Mini shines.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal is largely its design--interior as well as
exterior--and handling. There are other cars in about the same price
range that are just as much fun to drive (the $17,995 Ford SVT Focus
hatchback might be even more fun for drivers who like to push things
to the limit), but the Mini Cooper is in a class of its own when it
comes to looks.</TE>
<TE>   It is much larger and far more aerodynamic than the Mini of yore,
but there's no chance it will be taken for anything but a Mini. The
basic shape resembles a paper grocery bag tipped on its side. The
intent of the Mini's original designer, Sir Alexander Issigonis, was
to create the smallest package possible in which to comfortably haul
four grown-ups. The new Mini achieves Sir Alec's goal without
offending 21st century sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The classic two-tone paint scheme remains--a colored body topped
by a bright-white or gloss-black roof--but modernists can order the
roof painted to match the body. The wheels still are as far toward
the corners of the car as possible, but the new Mini's 10.9-inch
front brake discs are as big as the old Mini's entire front wheel.
The grille and winged Mini emblem on the nose mimic the original.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the new Mini resurrects dash-mounted toggle switches--done
away with in most cars long ago for safety reasons--to control
headlights, door locks, electric windows and the optional fog lamps
and stability-control system. A neat use of cushioned tabs to
separate the switches and catch wayward knees before they can be
stabbed by the toggles makes it possible.</TE>
<TE>   The interior features a tachometer mounted on the steering column
and a fat, round analog speedometer and gauge pod in the center of
the dashboard. The layout is a nod to Mini's rallying days, when the
navigator needed to use the speedo to make route calculations while
the driver needed nothing but the tach to monitor engine performance.
(Fear not: The new Mini's center-mount speedometer is easily visible
from the driver's seat.)</TE>
<TE>   Everything else, from big, round heat, vent and air conditioner
controls to the audio system, is mounted in a center stack that hangs
from the dash between two steel braces.</TE>
<TE>   The only annoying touch inside is the location of the hood
release, which is mounted on the passenger-side kick panel where it
is hard for the driver to get to. (It makes sense to put it there in
cars sold in England and Japan, where the driver sits on the wrong
side, but it is awkward in a car intended for the left-hand-drive
North American market.)</TE>
<TE>   The car comes with six air bags: two in front, two in the front
sides and two full-length air curtains for front and rear. The
BMW-derived safety package includes standard anti-lock brakes with
computer controls to modulate braking force on corners and to
compensate for the car's front-heavy weight bias (67% of its weight
is in the forward half of the vehicle).</TE>
<TE>   Tom Purves, chairman and chief executive of BMW Group Americas,
says the Mini is the first step in a strategy by the company's
Munich-based parent, Bayerische Motoren Werke, to develop "outside of
the BMW business." The second step will come in a year or so, after
BMW takes over Rolls-Royce production.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy, Purves said, "is to cover the world's entire luxury
performance market with these three brands." That would be Mini in
the $17,000-to-$24,000 range; BMW in the $24,000-to-$130,000 range;
and Rolls-Royce, "the jewelry end of the business," for those who
never have to ask "How much?"</TE>
<TE>   By plan, that makes Mini BMW's starter line, aimed at a youthful
buyer with budget constraints.</TE>
<TE>   But the car--sold continuously in Europe and Asia since its
introduction--hasn't been marketed in the U.S. since 1965.</TE>
<TE>   When Mini took its first public awareness poll in the States a
year ago, "less than 2% of Americans were aware of what the Mini
was," said Jack Pitney, Mini's general manager. That's good, because
Pitney and his crew can start with a clean slate, selling Mini on its
kicky looks and impressive performance.</TE>
<TE>   Although this is a front-wheel-drive car (BMW's first), it uses
the multi-link independent rear suspension from the BMW 3-Series with
a MacPherson strut arrangement up front. That setup keeps all four
tires firmly anchored and lets the Mini take corners with almost no
body roll.</TE>
<TE>   The new Mini also uses rack-and-pinion steering that keeps it
centered and responsive.</TE>
<TE>   Steering is pure joy, electrically powered (no drain on the engine
as with a hydraulic system) and needing but 21/2 turns lock to lock.
A quarter-turn of the comfortably fat steering wheel is enough to
negotiate all but the hairiest hairpins.</TE>
<TE>   It is the shortest car on the road in the U.S. at 142.8 inches,
but its wheels-to-the-corner stance gives it a respectable wheelbase
of 97.1 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Mini will introduce the hot-rod version, the Cooper S, in the U.S.
on Friday as well, but mostly for show. Mini dealers will each get a
pair of the supercharged Cooper S models, one to post on the showroom
floor and one for test drives. But it will be summer before cars
start arriving in volume. The S comes with a beefed-up suspension,
six-speed manual transmission and a supercharged 163-horsepower
version of the Mini Cooper's engine.</TE>
<TE>   The base engine is a transverse-mounted, 1.6-liter, 115-horsepower
inline-4 built in Brazil by Tritec, a joint venture of BMW and
DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   Mini manager Pitney said the company expects to sell 20,000 Minis
in the U.S. in the next 12 months, 70% of them plain-old Coopers and
30% S models.</TE>
<TE>   The base model's five-speed manual shifts smoothly but needs to be
shifted a lot, especially at lower speeds, to maintain peak engine
performance. For those who prefer, the Mini Cooper (but not the S)
also has an optional continuously variable transmission, or CVT, that
has been programmed to act like a six-speed Steptronic transmission
that can be shifted like a clutchless manual or left alone in D (for
"drive").</TE>
<TE>   Final Words: A car with a past, but not from there. The Mini
Cooper should be considered if you are under 30, have the hots for
the PT Cruiser or VW's New Beetle or just enjoy a fun ride.</TE>

<HD>Study on Children Shows the Downside of Pickups</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've never understood the allure of driving a pickup truck.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, if you're a construction worker or a farmer or need to tow a
large boat, owning one makes sense. But it puzzles me that so many
people use compact pickups as family vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   It seems as if the auto industry's marketing wizards have
convinced consumers that tooling around in a compact pickup is about
as cool as you can get. And for some it is a matter of
economics--small pickups are less expensive than most cars.</LD>
<TE>   But using them as family vehicles can be dangerous, according to
the findings of a new study released by Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia and published in the Journal of the American Medical
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Children riding on the rear fold-down jump seats in compact
extended-cab pickups are nearly five times as likely to be injured in
a crash than children in the back seats of other vehicles, the
two-year study found.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents should not be buying these vehicles as a family car,"
said Dr. Dennis Durbin, a pediatric emergency room physician and the
study's coauthor and principal investigator, referring to compact
extended-cab pickups.</TE>
<TE>   The study comes as the popularity of such trucks is growing: 83.2%
of small pickups sold last year had extended cabs, up from 57.2% in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The rear seats in these trucks, Durbin said, present "unique
hazards, including a small rear compartment, side-facing jump seats
and the limitation of a lap-only safety belt."</TE>
<TE>   (Four-door crew cab trucks have rear bench seats and all required
safety features, including shoulder and lap belts, so the risk of
injury is not as great as in the compact extended-cab models.)</TE>
<TE>   Among children hurt in compact extended-cab pickups, the most
common and disturbing injuries identified in the study were to the
head. They ranged from concussions to serious brain injury.</TE>
<TE>   Children in the study also had spinal cord and abdominal injuries,
serious chest injuries and fractured ribs, arms and legs. One
10-year-old boy died as a result of a spinal cord injury.</TE>
<TE>   Eron Shosteck, spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, said auto makers "are very specific that these compact
extended pickup trucks are not meant to be used as family vehicles."
Dealers, he said, should not be representing such trucks as family
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The fold-down auxiliary seats "are only meant to be used
temporarily--for example, ferrying construction workers around a
site," Shosteck said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's an emergency and a child does have to ride," he said,
"they need to be in the front seat, strapped in, or in a child seat"
with the passenger-side air bag turned off.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such assurances, it seems the trucks are being marketed as
family vehicles as well as work vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   After checking out a popular Ford Ranger extended-cab pickup at a
dealership, I can't imagine that those fold-down seats--about the
size of a large dinner plate--were designed to hold construction
workers.</TE>
<TE>   A salesman assured me that families take their children in the
truck and said that he was unaware of concerns about putting young
children in these seats.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly disconcerting is the fact that the small fold-down
seats are exempt from safety testing, because auto makers and the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration consider them
auxiliary, nonstandard seats.</TE>
<TE>   So children are riding in seats that have never been safety tested
and cannot accommodate a child safety seat.</TE>
<TE>   The study's authors have asked NHTSA officials to begin requiring
safety testing on such seats.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first real-world data available for NHTSA to evaluate
... and I trust there will be an appropriate response," Durbin said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the father of three small children, and I can't imagine
going out and purchasing this vehicle to transport my family," he
said. "There simply is not enough room [in the rear compartment] for
the head to move in the event of a crash ... and the padding in the
compartment space is insufficient to minimize the risk of a head
injury."</TE>
<TE>   The study was part of continuing research conducted by Partners
for Child Passenger Safety, a collaboration that includes the
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co. and the University of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians and researchers compiled and analyzed data from
accidents that occurred between December 1998 and November 2000. The
accidents involved 7,192 vehicles and 11,335 children-- 1,356 of whom
were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Durbin said that although auto makers may decry the use of small
trucks as family vehicles, there "is sometimes a disconnect" between
the corporate message and what is said in the showroom.</TE>
<TE>   That's a problem he would like the industry to address, he said,
noting: "Auto dealers are in a very unique position to provide safety
information to families with children."</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope auto makers and NHTSA officials take the warning
seriously.</TE>

<HD>From Russia With Love, a Limo With Storied Past</HD>
<DH>The imposing-looking 1982 vehicle was formerly in the
service of the Soviet government. It can be yours if you come up with
the winning auction bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For some, getting noticed is what being in L.A. is all about, and
what better way to get noticed than by driving an unusual car?</LD>
<LD>   Boy, have we got one for you.</LD>
<LD>   Porsches? Passe. Hot rods? Ho-hum. Convertibles? So conventional.</LD>
<TE>   We're talking 1982 Zil-115 limousine. And not just any limo but
the Presidential Transporter that was maintained by the KGB in Moscow
for the personal use of Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov from
1982 through 1984. (It was used by other politicians and bureaucrats
from '84 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and then was
sold to a private party.)</TE>
<TE>   You can bet your babushka that this hunk of polished black metal
will get you noticed anywhere you go in Southern California. Just
submit the top bid.</TE>
<TE>   The Zil is being offered in an online auction, through March 25,
by Bidz.com, at www.bidz.com, one of the myriad Internet auction
houses always trying to get people to notice them.</TE>
<TE>   Igor Krakovsky, the company's business development director, says
the limo--recently bought by Bidz--is valued at $350,000 but will be
sold to the highest bidder with no minimum. If the top bid is $2, so
be it, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The auction is being used to help generate publicity for Los
Angeles-based Bidz, which was launched in 1999. It certainly caught
our attention.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the six-passenger Zil boasts a 7.6-liter V-8
engine rated at 315 horsepower and gets about 10 miles per gallon.
But, no, we don't know where in L.A. you'd go to find a good Zil
mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   John O'Dell</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: The Zil was used to transport various high-ranking
government officials for much of its life, but after the fall of the
Soviet Union in 1991, it was sold to a private party before ending up
with Bidz.com in 2001.</CP>
