<HD>A New Way to Treat Alcoholism</HD>
<DH>Addiction: Acamprosate, a drug on verge of FDA approval,
shows promise when used with behavioral therapy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, the gold standard for treatment of alcohol addiction
was a month at the Betty Ford Center or another long-term chemical
dependency program, followed by regular visits to Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Now, scientists are rewriting the book on treatment as research
about alcohol's effect on the brain points toward an approach that
adds drug therapy and scientifically tested psychotherapy to such
mainstays as AA. And doctors are hoping to gain a new tool for this
evolving treatment regimen if a drug called acamprosate is approved
by the Food and Drug Administration later this month--the first new
alcoholism drug in eight years.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, acamprosate is no wonder drug. Studies in the United
States show that alcoholics who took the drug were able to stay sober
16% longer than a comparable study group that did not receive it.</LD>
<TE>   Despite those modest results, the drug is appealing to doctors
looking for a more sophisticated method of treating alcohol
dependency--one that acknowledges the physiological aspects of an
addiction that affects an estimated 14 million Americans. (About 8
million Americans have alcoholism, and another 6 million are believed
to suffer from alcohol abuse disorder, defined as a harmful pattern
of drinking that causes problems but does not entail physiological
addiction.)</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a stigma that [drug dependency] is a willpower
thing," says Dr. Lance Longo, clinical associate professor of
psychiatry at University of Wisconsin Medical School. "But we're
learning that brain chemistry does get messed up by using drugs or
alcohol, and we can speed up recovery if we use medication in a
proactive way."</TE>
<TE>   Medication, however, is only helpful when used in tandem with
behavioral therapy, scientists say, and experts hope to get a better
handle on how such treatment works with the results of a long-awaited
study conducted for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism. The study, expected to be completed next year, is
examining which particular combination of medications and
psychotherapy appears most successful.</TE>
<TE>   Though health insurance restrictions have curtailed the use of
long hospital stays to overcome alcohol addiction, new research has
convinced doctors that their patients do best if treated with a
combination of therapies tailored to an individual's needs.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past decade, we've learned that other things work
[besides] Alcoholics Anonymous," says Longo. "In the grand scheme of
things, there are many pieces of the pie to recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Acamprosate and another alcoholism drug, naltrexone, are not
abusable or addictive. And doctors are using other nonaddictive
drugs, such as anxiety and depression remedies, to augment alcohol
treatment strategies, says Dr. Richard Rosenthal, president elect of
the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry.</TE>
<TE>   In the not-so-distant past, addiction was often viewed--even by
experts in the field--as a problem resulting from a person not taking
responsibility for his own behavior. "There is a moral model of
addiction that blames the patient for the addiction and, therefore,
taking medications to undo that is wrong," explains Rosenthal. " ...
Fortunately, I think that kind of attitude is slowly going away."</TE>
<TE>   Though many doctors embrace medications to treat alcoholism, there
is still some reluctance, says Dr. Sylvie Chabac, international
project manager for Merck KGaA, which has marketed acamprosate in
Europe for 15 years. In Europe, Chabac says, "it was difficult to
convince self-help groups because they have a very strong message
based on self-motivation and not on pharmacotherapy. Now, we are used
to working with them. And we have good clinical experience that shows
it is not sufficient to treat with acamprosate without psychosocial
support."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that medications for alcoholism are useless in the
absence of behavioral therapy. "The core of treatment is cognitive
behavioral therapy: What is the motivation for abstinence, and how do
you rebuild your life without using substances?" says Dr. Mark
Schuckit, director of alcohol and drug treatment programs at the
Veterans Administration in San Diego. He cannot foresee a time when
medication therapy alone would be the standard treatment for
substance abuse disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Drugs do give doctors more ways to individualize treatment, says
Rosenthal.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are engaged in reasonably good treatment and they stay
in treatment, they get better over time," he says. "Unfortunately,
there are a lot of mediocre treatments out there. It's because people
aren't getting treatment matched to their situation."</TE>
<TE>   An FDA advisory committee voted 8 to 2 last month to recommend
approval of acamprosate under an expedited review program.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is expected to accept or reject that recommendation by
the end of June, although it could also delay approval pending more
information about the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Acamprosate, if approved, will be most helpful to people who are
motivated to stay sober but who are bothered by withdrawal symptoms
like insomnia, irritability and agitation.</TE>
<TE>   The symptoms are caused by the overstimulation of a type of
neurotransmitter in the brain. Some people may begin drinking again
to get relief from the symptoms. Acamprosate is thought to help calm
overactivity in the brain, reduce the symptoms and help prevent
relapse.</TE>
<TE>   In European studies, acamprosate doubled the period of time during
which people stopped drinking, contrasted with the 16% gain seen in
the U.S. study.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. study may have had less impressive results, however,
because it included all kinds of drinkers, including people who were
abusing other drugs and those who weren't committed to abstinence.</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe that acamprosate is best suited for people who
have stopped drinking and are motivated to recover from their
addiction.</TE>

<TE>   Other Drug Treatments</TE>
<TE>   * ReVia (naltrexone). Blocks the high of alcohol to curtail the
amount of drinking during a relapse. May also reduce craving for
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   * Antabuse (disulfiram). Used as a deterrent by causing a person
to become nauseated if they consume alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   * Acamprosate. Not yet approved by the FDA, the drug helps to ease
long-term symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and thus helps reduce the
likelihood of relapse.</TE>
<TE>   * Benzodiazepines. Used during detoxification to help with
withdrawal symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   * Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anti-anxiety drugs. Often used
in patients with psychiatric disorders, such as depression or panic
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   * Ondansetron. An anti-nausea drug that is under study for
alcoholics 25 and younger. May act on serotonin system in the brain
to affect the urge to drink.</TE>

<HD>Days-Old Socks That Smell as Fresh as a Daisy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life is busy. Every second counts. So wouldn't it be nice not to have
to change one's socks for days and days on end? (Of course, we all
know people who find this eminently achievable.)</LD>
<LD>   Happily, scientists have found time to tackle the smelly-sock
problem in between sequencing the human genome and cataloging sundry
fundamental particles. They've invented a fabric impregnated with a
chemical that kills the bacteria responsible for sock odor. You
really could wear these socks for days, though the fabric inventor,
Gang Sun of UC Davis, isn't specifically recommending this.</LD>
<LD>   That, in any case, is the least of what technologists have
invented, or are working on, in the handy-clothing line. Of course,
it will be some time before shirts, slacks and sweaters will pick up
groceries, file taxes or take the dog for a walk. But until that day,
there could be bras that send medical alerts. Vests that monitor your
vitals. Even shirts that nourish you.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of clever clothes being cooked up in labs (most
still under development):</TE>
<TE>   * First (to put everyone out of their suspense), smart bras.
British scientists have devised one, now being tested, that can
detect abnormal cells in the breast, including malignant ones.
Electrodes send little electrical currents to the breast, allowing
doctors to scan it from various angles and map the site of suspicious
tissues.</TE>
<TE>   That bra wouldn't be for regular, around-the-town wear, but
another kind of bra would. The Techno Bra (another British
invention--what is it about Brits and bras?) senses sudden jumps in
heart rate that could mean somebody's mugging you. A global
positioning satellite device then sends your location to the police.</TE>
<TE>   * Self-cleaning clothes. These second cousins to antibacterial
socks would hold carefully chosen bacteria to chew up sweat and
odor-causing chemicals. Scientists at the University of Massachusetts
at Dartmouth are still perfecting ways to get the bacteria into
fibers. But they envision a time when specially engineered bugs would
not only chew up clothing contaminants but ooze out antiseptics for
bandages or waterproof coatings.</TE>
<TE>   * Garments known tastefully as Under-Ease. These special
underclothes (already being marketed) protect the wearer from the
embarrassment of flatulence. Under-Ease's Pueblo, Colo., inventor was
inspired to design the pants because his wife had irritable bowel
syndrome and often suffered from such bouts. Nothing fancy about
these pants--just replaceable charcoal filters in the seat that
capture smelly hydrogen sulfide gas.</TE>
<TE>   * Inflatable suits. One such suit, concocted by a scientist at the
University of Tokyo, is covered with inflatable regions that act as
"muscles," giving a frail person a little extra strength. The
"muscles" expand when pressure sensors in the suit signal that it
would be helpful. Another--designed yet again by Japanese
scientists--works rather like air bags in cars. When a worker wearing
such a life jacket falls suddenly, the suit inflates, protecting the
vulnerable waist, neck and spine.</TE>
<TE>   * Nutritious garb. Not getting your vitamins? From Japan (one more
time) comes this strange invention: a fabric impregnated with a
vitamin C-related chemical. T-shirts could contain about two
lemons-worth of this chemical, explains the company blurb--enough to
survive 30 washings. The chemical would get absorbed by the skin,
turning into bona fide vitamin C as it does so. No longer would
anyone have to go through the hassle of eating an orange.</TE>
<TE>   * Smart shirts. Fibers in the SmartShirt, devised by scientists at
the Georgia Institute of Technology, are threaded with a
spaghetti-like mesh of optical fibers, allowing the shirt to sense
any number of bodily vital signs: heart rate, temperature, breathing
rate and more. Plus, its inventors say, it could be easily adapted to
detect things such as penetration by a bullet and levels of oxygen
and gases. And the shirt can even be laundered. (In my book, this is
a must; if I have to send it to the cleaners, I'm not buying it.)
SmartShirt will be launched in about a year, says a spokesperson for
the company Sensatex. Another garment that detects vital signs, the
LifeShirt, developed by VivomMetrics, is already FDA-approved for
clinical use.</TE>
<TE>   For those who get chilly at night or who like to climb chilly
mountains, there are already jackets, socks and bed linen made of
fabric that senses the temperature and releases stored-up heat when
it gets cold. For people with asthma, there's bedding with chemicals
that kill dust mites. The Army is working on clothing that would
change its color like a chameleon, detect wounds and gases, alert the
soldier's commander--even exude medicines. And on and on.</TE>
<TE>   As the fashion mavens say: It's not enough to fall in love with a
dress on a rack. When you put it on, it should work for you.</TE>

<HD>Vitamin E Study Reveals Clue About Prostate Cancer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For some time now there's been a widely held--but still
unproven--belief that vitamin E and selenium are useful against
prostate cancer. Now University of Rochester scientists have
uncovered an important clue to how vitamin E might do the job.</LD>
<LD>   By measuring the proteins made by prostate cancer cells exposed to
vitamin E in the lab, the researchers found that the vitamin inhibits
the protein, or receptor, that attaches to the male hormone androgen.
Prostate cancer cells need androgen to keep growing. They also found
that vitamin E inhibits another protein, called prostate specific
antigen, or PSA, though it's not known what role PSA plays. (PSA is
considered a marker for cancer because a high blood level of it may
indicate a malignancy in the prostate gland.)</LD>
<LD>   Selenium did not alter the two proteins. "It may prevent prostate
cancer but function by another pathway than vitamin E," says Shuyuan
Yeh, assistant professor of urology and pathology at the University
of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in New York. "Different
nutrients have different effects, and together they may be more
beneficial. Even vitamin E may have multiple functions, but this
[discovery] gives us some idea of how it works," she says.</LD>
<TE>   This finding could lead to advances in prostate cancer treatment
as well as prevention. The scientists found that when
alpha-tocopheryl succinate, a type of vitamin E, was added to an
androgen-blocking chemotherapy drug, the cancer cells grew more
slowly than when the drug was used alone.</TE>

<TE>   Lightning Strikes</TE>
<TE>   A clap of thunder or a bright flash may not be fair warning, but
it may be all you get before lightning strikes. Unfortunately, most
people hesitate too long or don't know what to do in those moments,
making lightning the second-leading cause of storm-related deaths in
the United States (after flooding). And although 90% of people struck
by lightning each year survive, many are severely injured and
permanently disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Since there are so many myths and misconceptions about how to stay
safe, meteorological and health experts participating in the
Lightning Safety Group established guidelines that have been accepted
by various sports, meteorological and medical groups. The guidelines
are based on the most recent research and were published in a medical
journal for the first time in June.</TE>
<TE>   Among the recommendations is the 30-30 rule: If the time between
seeing the flash and hearing the bang is less than 30 seconds, the
person should be in, or quickly seeking, a safer location.</TE>
<TE>   The second "30" refers to the all-clear. "You should not resume
activities until 30 minutes after the last lightning or thunder,"
says Dr. Mary Ann Cooper, associate professor in the department of
emergency medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a
member of the Lightning Safety Group.</TE>
<TE>   Safer areas include large structures with plumbing and electrical
wiring and fully enclosed metal vehicles (cars, trucks, buses and
enclosed farm vehicles). It's important to roll up windows and avoid
contact with metal or conducting surfaces outside or inside the
vehicle.</TE>

<TE>   Quit Smoking, Live Longer</TE>
<TE>   It goes without saying that the earlier you quit smoking the
better your chances of living longer. Now an analysis of 15 years of
data involving more than 1 million people puts some numbers behind
that common wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   Kicking the habit at 45 added about seven years to the lives of
both men and women. Men who quit at 55 added 3.4 to 4.6 years to
their lives, women who quit at 55 added 4.2 to 5.6 years to theirs.
Furthermore, the researchers found that even at 65, quitting could
add as much as two years to a man's life and nearly four years to a
woman's.</TE>
<TE>   "The life extension even at 65 is striking, [suggesting] the
resiliency of the body," says Donald H. Taylor Jr., assistant
research professor of public policy at Duke University's Center for
Health Policy, Law and Management in Durham, N.C. However, since
death from smoking begins to take its toll on those in their 50s and
60s, it may be that the 65-year-old smoker is more robust to begin
with, Taylor says.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers hope that if the well-known risks of the habit
haven't made people quit, the positive message of knowing how many
years they could gain by giving it up will be a motivator.</TE>

<TE>   Cheerleader in the Brain</TE>
<TE>   Why do some people hang in there when the going gets tough--and
others quit early on? Researchers looking for that inner cheerleader
may have found an explanation. Nerve cells in the part of the brain
involved with performance appear to fire more strongly as the
expectation of a reward approaches. The strength of that signal may
vary from one person to another, ultimately explaining why we run the
gamut in perseverance--from slacker to obsessive-compulsive.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial
Scinece and Technology in Japan monitored the activity of monkeys'
brains while the animals pressed and released bars in response to
seeing certain colored shapes on computer screens. When one task was
done, a colored bar at the top of the screen became brighter, and the
monkeys moved on to the next task. As the bar became brighter, the
monkeys knew they were getting closer to their reward.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a signal [from neurons in the brain] that was getting
stronger as the monkeys went through the trials ... then in the final
trial it often disappeared," says Dr. Barry J. Richmond, a coauthor
of the study and chief of the section on neural coding and
computation at the National Institute of Mental Health. Although
Richmond says it was the increasing strength of the cheerleader
signal that interested the researchers the most, they also observed
that the signal started to wind down as the monkeys got closer to
their payoff, a sip of juice. It's similar to what happens in humans
when they think that winning the game is a sure thing and they start
to relax. "Sometimes a person relaxes a little too early and they get
beaten."</TE>

<HD>Suggested Screening Looks for Depression</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHANKAR VEDANTAM</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Asking all patients who walk into offices for tests, physicals and
appointments two simple questions about whether they have experienced
some of the warning signs of depression can swiftly begin to identify
90% of people who suffer from major depression, health experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a highly influential
group of scientists that sets widely followed standards on topics
ranging from prostate cancer screenings to mammograms, recommended
last month that doctors routinely begin screening all patients for
depression. America's primary-care doctors are missing and
mistreating more than half of all cases of the common mental
disorder, the independent panel said.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation is the latest manifestation of the growing
recognition that depression is one of the most common--and most
commonly undiagnosed and untreated--chronic illnesses. About 19
million American adults suffer from depression, and estimates suggest
that as many as two-thirds do not get treatment. The new
recommendations could drastically recruit many of these people into
treatment, and add millions to the numbers who are already taking
antidepressants such as Prozac.</LD>
<TE>   Two-thirds of patients with depression are treated in primary-care
settings. Primary-care doctors also see most patients whose
depression goes undiagnosed, as people come through clinics for
routine outpatient care.</TE>
<TE>   "Primary-care doctors have done only a modestly good job in
recognizing and treating depression," said Michael Pignone, a
University of North Carolina researcher who analyzed the issue for
the task force. "Only half of cases are recognized in primary
settings and less than that are properly treated."</TE>
<TE>   The task force did not find sufficient evidence to recommend
routine depression screening for children and adolescents.</TE>
<TE>   Two questions ought to become the basic repertoire of every
patient visit, the task force recommended, in an announcement that
coincided with the American Psychiatric Assn.'s annual meeting here:
"Over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or
hopeless?" and "Over the past two weeks, have you felt little
interest or pleasure in doing things?"</TE>
<TE>   If a patient answers yes to either question, the task force
recommended that doctors offer patients written or oral
questionnaires. These ask more specific questions and establish
whether the problems are transient or persistent.</TE>
<TE>   "Most patients who are depressed have some diminished function,"
said Alfred Berg, a professor at the University of Washington in
Seattle and the chair of the task force. "They don't take pleasure in
activities, they are not productive, can't concentrate, are often
sleep-deprived, don't eat well, have headaches or low back pain. If
you go through a formal assessment, you find the depressed patients
aren't doing as well."</TE>

<HD>Eyedrops Fend Off Blindness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eyedrops that lower pressure inside the eye can delay the onset of
glaucoma, the second-leading cause of blindness, according to new
research that should influence the way many at-risk patients are
treated.</LD>
<LD>   The drops were used to treat a condition called ocular
hypertension, in which fluid in the front chamber of the eye doesn't
drain properly and pressure builds up. When the pressure rises
sufficiently, it can press on the optic nerve and kill cells
responsible for vision, crossing the threshold to become glaucoma.
Other factors contributing to glaucoma risk include age, thickness of
the cornea and the anatomy of the optic nerve.</LD>
<LD>   So-called open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of the
disease, affects about 2.2 million Americans 40 and older; doctors
estimate 2 million more may have it. The leading cause of blindness
among African Americans, open-angle glaucoma develops slowly, often
without symptoms. By the time it's detected, a patient's field of
vision may have narrowed.</LD>
<TE>   But by intervening with medication in patients with elevated eye
pressure readings, doctors reduced by more than 50% the number of
cases that developed into open-angle glaucoma after five years.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers, led by Dr. Michael Kass, an ophthalmologist at
Washington University in St. Louis, studied 1,636 people from age 40
to 80 who had high ocular pressure, but no vision changes or
abnormalities in the eye's structure associated with glaucoma. Half
were given daily eyedrops; the others were just monitored. The
medication lowered the pressure of the treated group by about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "It is significant that this modest 20% reduction in eye pressure
had such an important protective effect," said Kass.</TE>
<TE>   Until the study results were published in the June issue of
Archives of Ophthalmology, doctors didn't know for sure whether
reducing high eye pressure could delay or prevent glaucoma, although
about 1.5 million people were being treated prophylactically anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The study was supported by the National Eye Institute, the
National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities, the
Research to Prevent Blindness foundation and Merck Research
Laboratories.</TE>

<LD>Picture this as a reason to dust off your tennis game: The boss gets
wind that you've played a fair amount of tennis over the years and
invites you to bat the ball around. The problem is that you haven't
been on a tennis court in a long time and no doubt will make a fool
of yourself.</LD>
<LD>   I speak from experience, having been thrashed by older-boss types
on several occasions, much to their unabashed delight. But I have a
solution for such dilemmas, albeit a somewhat pricey one--the tennis
lesson.</LD>
<LD>   I've used this resource several times over the years, including
times when I've gone on fitness jags and, more recently, to keep up
with my children's games. At one point several years ago, they were
taking lessons three times a week and were soon powering backhands
past me with embarrassing ease. I had to shell out for my own lessons
in self-defense.</LD>
<TE>   This time around, I did it as a first step in returning to the
game, something I'd been meaning to do for a while. On the advice of
a friend, I chose Will Moravec, the teaching pro at La
Canada-Flintridge Country Club, located just off Angeles Crest
Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Though only 36, Moravec is a longtime fixture at the club, having
worked there for the last 12 years. A native of Rancho Palos Verdes,
he's hit with tennis greats Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi and
competed for Cal State Long Beach back in the days when it had a
nationally ranked tennis team.</TE>
<TE>   Moravec knows from experience that there are some clear divisions
in people who take lessons and whether or not they are coachable.
Children age 6 and up are perhaps the easiest to train because they
have no preconceived notions and they follow directions. Teenagers,
particularly boys, are almost impossible to train because they lack
patience.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is a gap with young adults, who are usually too busy
beginning careers and families to take lessons. He said they begin to
return to the game in their mid- to late 30s as a way of staying in
shape.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing about lessons is that they teach you how
to avoid tennis elbow and they allow you to learn enough so that you
can continue to grow as a player," said Moravec as we walked down to
the well-maintained court.</TE>
<TE>   He said that a novice could lay a tennis foundation--serve and get
the ball back and forth--with five or six lessons.</TE>
<TE>   I clicked on my heart-rate monitor as I began some stretches,
while Moravec explained that the best tennis players rally slowly at
first, working on rhythm while muscles loosen. Then, as the warmup
continues, they use more forceful strokes, ending with overheads and
serves.</TE>
<TE>   Moravec wheeled a basket of balls to the center of the court and
began putting me through my paces. One thing I've learned from past
experience is that lessons can be grueling, even for the best
conditioned. But they also offer a fine workout because movement is
almost constant, and hitting hundreds of balls eliminates any
possibility of boredom. Moravec said several of his middle-age
students value the exercise as much as the learning.</TE>
<TE>   We started with some easy hits, with both of us at midcourt.
Moravec noted immediately that I wasn't dropping my racquet low
enough on forehand strokes. Then I moved back to the baseline, taking
a number of easy forehands and backhands. I looked at my heart-rate
monitor and noticed that I was well above the 140 mark, the high end
of my optimum range.</TE>
<TE>   Then we began some more strenuous exercises in which I had to run
from side to side, first returning forehands, then backhands, then
alternating between the two.</TE>
<TE>   After doing this for several minutes, I was winded but encouraged
that my strokes were showing a bit more consistency. Finally we did
overheads and serves, both of which were unremarkable in the extreme.
Having said that, though, I felt as though I'd made some major
progress.</TE>
<TE>   Moravec said tennis is not as popular as it was a decade ago but
is far ahead of the doldrums it suffered through in the '60s and
early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The women's game, in comparison with the men's, is flourishing
because of new stars such as the Williams sisters and Lindsay
Davenport. The key, said Moravec, is to attract children away from
computer games and back onto the court.</TE>
<TE>   "The tennis world is trying to get to the younger generation," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The hour's lesson went by too quickly. I packed up my tennis bag
and we returned to the pro shop, where I wrote a check for $46. A
pricey hour's worth of exercise but worth it if it meant I was
beginning to get a little of my game back.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pregnant women with HIV can safely take AIDS drugs without risk of
having a premature baby or one with neurological problems, a study
found.</LD>
<LD>   The study did find a slightly increased risk--from 1% to 2%--of
babies with the lowest birth weights, or less than 3.3 pounds, if the
drugs included what are known as protease inhibitors.</LD>
<LD>   The analysis was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine and was done by Dr. Ruth E. Tuomala of Harvard-affiliated
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.</LD>
<TE>   In the United States, pregnant women are routinely given AIDS
drugs such as AZT because the medicines have been found to be
powerfully effective at controlling the mother's disease and
preventing the virus from being passed on to the baby.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis was prompted by two small European studies with a
total of 66 patients that found that pregnant women on AIDS drug
combinations have a one-third higher risk of premature delivery.</TE>
<TE>   The new analysis involved seven U.S. studies that looked at 2,123
women on HIV drugs, including 137 whose "cocktail" included protease
inhibitors. For comparison, the analysis also looked at 1,143 babies
whose HIV-infected mothers did not get any such drugs because the
medications had not yet been approved for pregnant women.</TE>
<TE>   Very low birth weight raises a baby's risk of death and disabling
medical problems.</TE>
<TE>   But women who took a protease inhibitor were likely to be sicker
than those who were given a drug combination without it, so the
chance of having a tiny baby could have been caused by the mothers'
sickness, Tuomala said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any small increase in the risk of low birth weight is likely to
be outweighed by the substantial benefits of treatment with protease
inhibitors for both the mother and the infant," she said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding the article "About Kids and Sex" (June 3): On what basis
can a child make informed consent about their sexual choices?</LD>
<LD>   They haven't had the experience of adulthood, with its
responsibilities and obligations. It is a rare 14-year-old who can
make wise decisions about birth control, pregnancy, parenthood,
venereal diseases, abortion and a responsible mate.</LD>
<LD>   Sex brings a lot of issues with it. Adult issues. Is it fair to
ask a young person with only childhood experience to make adult
decisions?</LD>

<TE>   I am at a loss as to why the L.A. Times would print a seemingly
favorable article about Judith Levine and her despicable theories.</TE>
<TE>   I realize that your argument in favor of presenting such an
article would run along the lines of promoting healthy discussion,
but there is nothing healthy, no matter how you slant it, about
adults having sex with children. The only healthy response to this
piece of misguided journalism and Judith Levine is revulsion.</TE>
<TE>   I will never again buy another Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   GAYLE McDONALD</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What are you thinking? Are we actually discussing kids' need for
sexual pleasure? If that's not bad enough, having them engage in
sexual pleasures with adults? I don't know of anyone, with the
exception of James in your article, who says they are fine or better
off for their sexual relations as a minor. Most people say they wish
they had waited to have sex.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read with interest the articles regarding acceptance of teenage
sexuality, and I must categorically disagree with the arguments
presented. I fear grown-ups who seek casual or strictly sexual ties
with the young are the worst kind of predators. For the most part,
the older partner has no desire to watch a younger partner flower,
intellectually or emotionally. He merely wants a fresh young body,
which will be in thrall and--for desperation and loneliness--will do
what youth is wont to do, follow the older lover's directions. The
directions will soon cover every aspect of the younger person's life.
For the lover of a minor is basically a bully.</TE>
<TE>   SONDRA MERCER</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harris Mirkin and Judith Levine and the others cited in the
article should say what they actually mean: Let the kids copulate.
Don't give us this line about letting them experience "intimacy" in a
"consensual" situation. Kids are learning to clean their rooms,
shower daily, operate automobiles, turn in homework assignments and
socialize constructively with their peers. They are not, by and
large, capable of the complex emotional and psychological intimacy
that accompanies every act of sex, consensual or not.</TE>
<TE>   To pretend that the adults who prey on the confusion and
vulnerability of adolescents in order to sexually gratify themselves
at those kids' expense are in any way functional, mature or healthy
damages everyone.</TE>
<TE>   LINDA CRAWFORD</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if most of the psychological harm and moral scarring done
to today's kids is a result of them being made to feel guilty, dirty
and ashamed by the almost hysterical attitude that prevails. It seems
to be a sort of sexual McCarthyism that is doing more harm than good.
There must be a better way to cope with this situation than the way
it's being handled now. I hope we can arrive at some method that will
stop damaging so many young people.</TE>
<TE>   WALT HOPMANS</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a pediatrician, I see the harm that comes from the denial of
children's sexuality. Of course, there is no such thing as consensual
sex between a child and an adult--that goes without saying. But
parents are shocked by the normal exploration and interest that
children have in their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Worse than that, however, is the inability of parents to deal with
sexuality in a rational and educational manner.</TE>
<TE>   Giving the "growing up" talk to a group of girls and their mothers
at a school recently, I mentioned masturbation for about 30 seconds.
The total message was that some people say it is wrong but the most
important thing for you to know is that it cannot hurt you. Three
parents objected that I dealt with it at all and one mother grabbed
her daughter and left. I feel sorry for those children. We know that
education gives girls the tools to take responsibility for their
bodies, and the more we talk about it, the later they initiate sex
and the fewer partners they have.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A doctor leaving medicine is not like a vendor posting a
going-out-of-business sign--patients just don't move on to the
competitor down the street. Replacing the trust and confidence that
are key to a good doctor-patient relationship isn't easy.</LD>
<LD>   Yet millions of people face this dilemma every year as managed
care, moves and other factors uproot patients from long-standing
relationships with their doctors.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to choosing a new doctor, there are few places to
look for good advice. In the future, objective facts and figures may
be able to help, but for now most people wisely turn to
recommendations of family and friends who, in effect, are saying, I
trust my own doctor, and he or she may be good for you.</LD>
<TE>   That's how I chose my gynecologist 22 years ago. But now he has
given up his practice because of poor health, turning it over to a
very personable female doctor. Essentially he is telling his patients
that she is good enough to care for them and that they will be
treated well.</TE>
<TE>   This doctor delivered my daughter and followed me into middle age
to help me confront the need for mammograms and hormone replacement
therapy. I didn't always agree with him. When he said he was a
believer in hormone replacement, I knew the evidence that this would
protect me against heart disease was thin, and when he advocated Pap
smears every six months, I knew there wasn't much evidence supporting
their value either. Yet I stayed with him because I valued his
communications skills and openness.</TE>
<TE>   So when it comes to his replacement, I will trust his judgment and
look no further. Trust is not easily broken, so something will have
to go horribly wrong to make me change.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've had many good experiences and a long-term relationship,
you allow for the occasional difference of opinion or the troubled
appointment and maintain your loyalty," says Dr. Bart Wald, president
of Physician Associates of the Greater San Gabriel Valley, a large
medical group.</TE>
<TE>   However, if trust is not there to begin with, care may suffer. A
new study from the Commonwealth Fund, a health care research
foundation, underscores the importance of relationship and trust. In
a 2001 survey of almost 7,000 adults, one in four people said they
did not follow a doctor's advice or treatment plan or get recommended
tests or referrals in the last two years largely because they
disagreed with their doctor or because the advice ran counter to
their beliefs or was impractical for them.</TE>
<TE>   Even more astonishing, the survey found that 23% of respondents
did not have a regular doctor, and only one in three had had the same
physician for more than five years. It's hard to build much trust
when you don't regularly see the same practitioner. Trust and
confidence are only one aspect of getting good medical care. Doctors
must correctly diagnose your ailment and prescribe the right
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here's where the facts-and-figures crowd comes in. If people had
objective data on the performance of physicians, such information
might replace recommendations of family and friends and maybe even
the less tangible things such as quality of personal interactions
with doctors, which are pretty important. Medical outcomes--did the
patient improve, did quality of life improve?--would better identify
real physician performance, some argue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm incredibly optimistic about Americans having objective
quality information about performance of different doctors to help
them make better choices in the next 10 years and not having to rely
on what their neighbors told them," says Peter Lee, president of the
Pacific Business Group on Health. "They will be able to know that Dr.
Jones does a better job of hip replacement or Dr. Smith does a better
job treating diabetics."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually Lee's group, a coalition of employers that buy health
insurance, hopes to measure how well each of the 70,000 doctors in
California scores on a variety of measures. So far, they are working
on measures for medical groups and will publish results this fall
that compare how groups stand based on their patients' experiences.</TE>
<TE>   But research is a long way from giving us measures that say, for
example, whether Dr. Jones is good at hip replacements, and it's not
likely that such numbers will ever replace relationships and the
gut-level trust people need to obtain good care. Nor should they,
especially when it comes to primary care or family doctors, even
gynecologists.</TE>
<TE>   With specialists it might be different. You want your cardiologist
to follow standard treatment protocols and your back surgeon to be
technically competent and achieve good results. Some objective
guidance might be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the American Diabetes Assn. along with the National
Committee for Quality Assurance, a group that accredits managed care
organizations, is giving a kind of seal of approval to more than
1,500 doctors across the country who have met certain benchmarks in
treating diabetic patients. Doctors voluntarily submit patient
records that indicate whether appropriate care has been given, such
as eye and foot exams, plus blood sugar tests showing results in a
certain range. If doctors meet standards, they win recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-one doctors in California, but only six in Los Angeles, have
stepped forward to participate. Obviously only doctors likely to meet
the standards submit their records, although, according to Lisa
Joyner, who directs the program, about 2% of the applicants fail to
meet the benchmarks. To see which doctors do, visit www.ncqa.org/dprp
or call (800) DIABETES.</TE>
<TE>   Programs such as this have merit. So far the diabetes program is
unique, but in the next few years there may be similar programs
recognizing doctors who treat patients for cardiac disease and other
common, high-cost illnesses. With only about 20% of diabetic patients
receiving the important blood sugar tests every six months and
thousands of heart attack victims failing to get lifesaving beta
blocker drugs, someone should be looking over the doctor's shoulder.
If you are referred to a specialist, it would help to have some data
that show you have a shot at a good outcome.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, care circles back to the intangibles of good medical
practice. One New York City doctor who treats diabetic patients says
his most important role is to convince them to take the necessary
steps to control their disease. If they don't, he adds, his technical
skills and knowledge mean very little. That ability is not always
reflected in the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   It gets back to the trust and confidence that are implicit when
your friends recommend their doctor.</TE>

<LD>Question: Which type of muscle contractions cause muscle soreness?</LD>
<LD>   CAROL KELLER</LD>
<LD>   Blue Hill, Maine</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There are various types of contractions. A concentric
contraction is when the muscle shortens as it overcomes resistance,
such as in an upward curl with a weight. An eccentric contraction is
when the muscle lengthens in opposition to gravity, such as in the
lowering of the aforementioned weight. An isometric contraction is
when one set of muscles is tensed to counter another set of muscles
or when an object is too heavy to move even though muscle force is
being applied.</TE>
<TE>   Research has shown that eccentric muscle contractions and, to some
extent, isometric contractions cause more soreness than concentric
ones. To prevent muscle soreness always rest between workouts,
stretch and cross-train.</TE>

<LD>   www.womenheart.org</LD>
<LD>   Background: Founded by three heart attack survivors frustrated by
the lack of information on women and heart disease, WomenHeart is a
national nonprofit that promotes early diagnosis of heart disease,
education and support for women at risk.</LD>
<TE>   The organization is backed by donations from individuals and
corporations, including makers of drugs and medical technology.</TE>
<TE>   What Works: One of the best things about WomenHeart is the good
company it provides; its lively bulletin board is filled with
interesting, detailed stories of women who've had heart symptoms or
scares. The site also handles the basic questions about heart
attacks: "Many people think a heart attack is sudden and intense,
like a 'movie' heart attack ... the truth is that many heart attacks
start slowly, as a mild pain or discomfort."</TE>
<TE>   Women often perceive heart symptoms differently from men, and have
different treatment decisions to make--whether to start hormone
therapy, for instance. The site could do a better job of explaining
these differences. But it's very strong in directing families and
sufferers on where to go for help and support.</TE>

<HD>In Their Iron Years</HD>
<DH>More and more people in their 60s, 70s and beyond are
discovering that fitness isn't just for the young. And some, even
after leading sedentary lives, are in their best shape ever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somehow we've come to believe that if we're not natural athletes or
haven't made exercise a habit before middle age, the door to getting
fit has closed behind us. That perception is being shattered.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is it never too late to begin exercising, but some
latecomers to physical fitness achieve the shape of their lives in
their 60s and 70s.</LD>
<LD>   As their ranks increase, seniors are proving to themselves--and to
those who have years to go before retirement--that it's possible to
reinvent the body even after decades of indulgent meals and little
exercise. And for them, as for their younger counterparts, the health
and psychological benefits are enormous.</LD>
<TE>   Walk almost any morning into the Sports Club/LA in West Los
Angeles, and you can't miss John A. McMannus, who at 76 routinely
puts men half his age to shame. He bench-presses 300 pounds, pedals a
stationary bike at one of the hardest settings, sets the treadmill at
a brisk 5.5-mph pace (with a steep incline) and crunches his already
toned abdominals.</TE>
<TE>   "With me, it's all competition with myself," says McMannus, a
retired commercial airline pilot who got the exercise bug at 50. Now
at an age at which many seniors' shoulders already slump, he stands
ramrod straight and has the light step of a younger man.</TE>
<TE>   Such vigor and strength in the elderly didn't always seem
possible, except for perennial exercise icons like Jack LaLanne.</TE>
<TE>   Just 10 years ago, at 72, Jack Palance riveted an Academy Awards
audience with a series of one-armed push-ups the night he won a best
supporting actor Oscar. At the time, he was pointedly defying
Hollywood's ageism--and the stereotype of a cane-assisted senior. But
that stereotype is rapidly becoming obsolete. As Americans live
longer, and more healthily, than ever before, seniors are realizing
that fitness doesn't have to decline with age. Their doctors and
exercise physiologists agree. Most relatively healthy men and women,
they say, need not be limited by age.</TE>
<TE>   "Most fit older adults have at least one to three chronic
diseases. We still call them a normal, healthy adult even if they
have cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis," said Miriam
Nelson, a nutritionist and director of Tufts University's Center for
Physical Activity and Nutrition in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   McMannus, for example, has overcome chronic back problems and
underwent quadruple bypass surgery seven years ago, although he was
back in the gym 17 days later. He even has macular degeneration and,
by chronicling his symptoms while working out, is trying to help
doctors understand the effects of intense exercise on that problem.
Earlier this month he came home from a doctor's visit and recited his
enviable numbers: blood pressure, 126/54; pulse, 47; and body fat,
10% to 12%.</TE>
<TE>   "As a general view, there seems to be very little evidence that
older exercisers, however you want to define that, have to do
something different than younger exercisers," said Michael Hewitt, an
exercise physiologist who oversees medical, behavioral, nutrition and
exercise physiology activities at the Canyon Ranch health resort in
Tucson. The resort emphasizes health, stress reduction and fitness,
even for those with physical limitations.</TE>
<TE>   As landmark studies with nursing home residents and other
sedentary seniors have shown, you can build muscle late in life and
maintain it. No matter how lofty an older exerciser's goals, he or
she should begin with conditioning, general strengthening and
flexibility and consult a physician before proceeding. But, Hewitt
said, "the biggest mistake that most people tend to make is not to
challenge themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Just as it does for younger people, aerobic exercise strengthens
the heart and cardiovascular system, reducing the risk of heart
attacks. It improves sugar metabolism, reducing the risk of
developing diabetes or helping to control glucose levels in
diabetics. It improves balance, reducing the risk of falls. And
weight-bearing exercise helps build bone mass to avoid osteoporosis
and fractures of the hip and back. It can reverse bone loss in those
whose bones already have become brittle.</TE>
<TE>   Do nothing, though, and, beginning at age 35, "you lose a quarter
to a third of a pound of muscle every year and gain that much body
fat," Nelson said. Despite all the attention to cardiovascular
fitness, strength training is critical to preserving muscle mass.
"Research is showing us now that over two decades, from 50 to 70,
those doing some strength training along with aerobic training don't
lose muscle."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, fit seniors' less-than-bulging biceps can be deceptive.
They may not be as enlarged as those of a younger person, but those
muscles are working much more efficiently. Nelson explained that more
of the muscle fibers in a fit older person are firing away than in a
younger person.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of her research in several key senior exercise
studies, Nelson observed that "once these people started getting
stronger, they naturally took up a more active lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Dorothy Barron, 73, of Taunton, Mass., who did no
formal exercise while working and raising 11 children. But in 1993
she began making the twice-weekly 40-minute drive into Boston for a
Tufts study of post-menopausal women. Researchers led by Nelson
wanted to see if these women could gain muscle through strength
training, all the while maintaining their weight.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time I was in the program three months, I suddenly
realized I had gone down three dress sizes, and I hadn't lost an
ounce," said Barron, who dropped to a size 12. "I thought this was
remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   Once the study ended, she joined her local YMCA and added power
walking to her weightlifting and exercise routine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 she entered the Massachusetts Senior Games, the
preliminaries to the Senior Olympics. "I was just going to give it a
try. I never thought I'd win anything," said Barron.</TE>
<TE>   She took home a silver medal. Two more silvers followed, in 2000
and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by her successes, she decided to "try something a
little different" and took up the shotput. More recently, she's gone
white-water rafting on the Snake River in the Northwest and
parasailing in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of proud of myself," said Barron, who anticipates
qualifying for the Senior Olympics and mastering new sports or
athletic events.</TE>
<TE>   Signing up for the Tufts program nine years ago "helped me realize
the potential that I could have, the things I could do that I never
would have thought of."</TE>
<TE>   Among the evidence that seniors like her are achieving higher
levels of activity is the increasing rate of sports injuries. The
Consumer Product Safety Commission found a 54% increase in such
injuries among people 65 and older from 1990 to 1996. In that same
1998 report, the agency found a 29% increase in sports injuries among
those 75 and older. The majority of the injuries occurred during
activities such as biking, skiing, tennis and skating. The report
also found a 173% increase in injuries related to exercising,
including weight training, such as falls, tripping and strains.</TE>
<TE>   But injuries are no more common among seniors than younger people,
and they heal just as well, says Dr. Walter M. Bortz II, a geriatric
specialist, author of "Dare to Be 100" and a marathon runner. In
fact, Bortz, 72, and his wife, Ruth Anne, 71, recently became the
first couple older than 70 to finish the Boston Marathon. She was the
only woman over 70 to cross the finish line; he finished 26th among
the 29 men over 70 who completed the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I was beaten by an 87-year-old man," said Walter Bortz, laughing.
Bortz began running at age 45 while grieving the loss of his father,
a pioneering geriatrician. Since then, his experience running 33
marathons, not to mention the weight training he began five years
ago, has made him a more resilient competitor: "It's getting easier.
It used to be I thought I was going to die."</TE>
<TE>   Bortz relies on what he calls "the wisdom of the body" to help
avoid injuries. "The more you know, the more competent you are. Pain
is nature's way of telling you to slow down, not to quit."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, folks in their 70s, 80s and even 90s have not
only refused to quit, they've entered the record books with amazing
feats of fitness. Hulda Crooks got the nickname "Grandma Whitney" for
climbing 14,945-foot Mt. Whitney two dozen times between ages 66 and
91. Crooks, who died at 101 in 1997, also set a Senior Olympics world
record in the 1,500-meter race at the age of 82.</TE>
<TE>   In December, at age 77, a Floridian named David Clark became the
oldest person to single-handedly sail around the world. And an
89-year-old Briton, Helen Tew, last July marked her second
transatlantic crossing in a 29 1/2-foot yacht.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hewitt and many exercise experts advise setting goals
high, anyone new to physical activity should exercise common sense,
warned Molly Mettler of Boise, Idaho, the new chairwoman of the
National Council on Aging. "Start gently. Go for the distance. Don't
try to achieve overnight results."</TE>
<TE>   That's something that Joan Wright, 67, a retired insurance broker
from Sherman Oaks, has kept in mind in the year since she decided
that a decade of morning power walks wasn't enough for her.</TE>
<TE>   She added strength training and aerobics classes near home. Then,
when she signed up several months ago for a Friday afternoon acting
class offered through the Oasis program for seniors at the Westside
Pavilion mall in West Los Angeles, Wright decided to arrive early for
two hours of exercise classes taught by the acting teacher. She got
hooked.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I can't quit," said Wright, who for years missed the feeling
she got competing in childhood gymnastics. "I have the confidence
that I could do more."</TE>

<LD>If you are rushed to an American hospital today with chest pain
caused by clogged arteries to your heart, the chances are good that
you will get an artery-opening procedure called angioplasty, and the
insertion of a tiny, mesh-like device called a stent to keep your
arteries open.</LD>
<LD>   If you had the same symptoms in Europe, you'd still get
angioplasty, but with an important twist. Instead of a regular stent,
you and your physician could opt for a new coated stent that, in
addition to keeping arteries open through sheer structural support,
releases drugs that combat the inflammatory process that can cause
uncoated stents to fill up with scar tissue.</LD>
<LD>   Coated stents will probably be on the U.S. market in the next year
or so. And no matter which company gets there first--the leaders are
Cordis (a Johnson &amp; Johnson company), Boston Scientific and a joint
effort by Guidant Corp. and Cook Inc.--the new stents are likely to
revolutionize the way doctors treat heart patients.</LD>
<TE>   Most important, they are expected to reduce dramatically the
current 30% to 50% rate at which arteries re-narrow after stenting, a
process called restenosis. In fact, some data show an almost
unheard-of 100% success rate (meaning zero restenosis) for the
drug-delivery stents after two years of follow-up.</TE>
<TE>   "The anticipation is extraordinary in this field," said Dr.
Campbell Rogers, director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory
at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "The impact of having a new,
less-invasive and more effective treatment for coronary artery
disease is vast."</TE>
<TE>   The new stents will likely become the preferred option not just
for the 1 million or so Americans a year who now get regular stents,
but for hundreds of thousands of others currently deemed ineligible
because they have too many bad arteries. They may also be used for
hundreds of thousands of others with "vulnerable plaques," arteries
with fatty deposits that have not yet ruptured.</TE>
<TE>   "If the results of these early trials are confirmed in larger
studies, coated stents should significantly reduce the need for
coronary artery bypass surgery," says Dr. Sidney C. Smith, chief
science officer for the American Heart Assn. and a professor of
medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jesse Currier, associate director of the adult cardiac
catheterization lab at UCLA Medical Center, put it even more
emphatically: "This is Neil Armstrong, one giant leap for
interventional cardiology ... this is a huge, huge quantum leap."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the biggest downside may turn out to be that financially
strapped hospitals could suffer as patients choose the new stents
over bypass surgery, a huge money-earner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Commonplace as they now are, regular stents have actually been on
the U.S. market for only a few years, after two major trials showed
that simply placing an uncoated stent into an artery was better than
angioplasty alone in reducing the risk of restenosis. (In
angioplasty, doctors thread a tube called a catheter up through an
artery in the groin to the coronary arteries, then push a button to
inflate a balloon to compress the plaque against the artery wall.)</TE>
<TE>   Even though uncoated stents do just fine at keeping artery walls
from collapsing, their sheer presence can create new problems, notes
Dr. Elazer Edelman, director of the Harvard-MIT Biomedical
Engineering Center, a professor of health sciences and technology at
MIT and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The worst
possibility is that, immediately after insertion, the stent can
trigger blood clots, a process that doctors guard against by giving
patients anti-clotting drugs such as aspirin and Plavix. But there's
another danger, too, after insertion of a stent. "You're leaving a
foreign body behind. Now, as opposed to a single injury from
inflating a balloon, you have a rigid, metal object that can trigger
a slow, chronic inflammatory process," Edelman says. Indeed,
inflammation is now believed to be a root cause of atherosclerosis,
the initial formation of plaques, and of restenosis, the re-clogging
of arteries during the healing process after angioplasty and stent
insertion. Cholesterol, specifically LDL (the "bad" cholesterol) is
still a major culprit. But its effects include stimulation of the
body's natural inflammatory response to injury--sending immune cells
to clean up the area.</TE>
<TE>   To fight this inflammatory process in people with regular stents,
doctors have tried local application of radiation, including
radioactive stents and radioactive pellets placed temporarily within
the stent. This approach has not been shown to prevent
restenosis--and may actually impair normal healing of the artery--but
can help combat restenosis that has already occurred. A potentially
better solution, Edelman and other researchers reasoned, might be to
coat stents with drugs that could stop proliferation of inflammatory
cells. One idea was to coat a stent directly with a medication, the
approach taken by Guidant/Cook. Another was to create polymers
(chains of identical chemicals) that could act as a glue to hold
drugs on and inside a stent in such a way as to release the drugs
slowly, over a matter of days or even weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A series of studies recently made public shows just how effective
coated stents can be.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, a pilot study involving 45 patients in the
Netherlands and 30 in Brazil suggested that the Cordis stent coated
with a drug called sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) could help
prevent restenosis.</TE>
<TE>   The studies were led by Dr. Patrick Serruys at the Thorax Center
in Rotterdam and Dr. Jose Eduardo Sousa at the Dante Pazzanese
Institute of Cardiology in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The two-year follow-up
on these patients, presented this spring at the meeting of the
American College of Cardiology in Atlanta, showed a restenosis rate
of zero.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another study called RAVEL, led by Dr. Marie-Claude Morice, head
of Interventional Cardiology at the Institut Hospitalier Jacque
Cartier in Massy, France, was also presented at the Atlanta
cardiology meeting. Like the pilot study, the stents in this research
were coated with sirolimus, and the results on 238 patients in Europe
and Latin America were "astonishing," says Currier of UCLA. Several
hundred patients were followed for up to one year "with no major
adverse cardiac events, no restenosis."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the sirolimus-coated stent is being tracked in an even
bigger study of 1,100 patients (called SIRIUS) at Lenox Hill Hospital
in New York City and other centers. The six-month follow-up data are
not yet public, but a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, David
Swearingen, says the initial data is being submitted to the Food and
Drug Administration for approval of this stent product. The
sirolimus-coated stent, called Cypher, has already received
regulatory approval for marketing in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The other main approach is coating stents with paclitaxel, but not
in the high doses that proved dangerous. Boston Scientific Corp.,
based in Natick, uses a polymer to stick paclitaxel onto its stent.
In the pilot study of 61 patients, researchers found zero restenosis
after six months of follow-up. A larger study of about 500 patients
"provided further support for the safety of paclitaxel," says company
spokesman Paul Donovan. The paclitaxel stent also seems to prevent
restenosis, a third study shows, as a stent placed inside a stent
already in the artery.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Scientific's most important study, TAXUS IV, which involves
more than 1,000 patients at 80 medical centers, is still underway,
but the company is optimistic: "We plan to launch a drug-coated stent
in Europe this year and in the U.S. next year," Donovan says.</TE>
<TE>   The third main contender for bringing a drug-coated stent to the
U.S. market is Guidant/Cook. Like Boston Scientific, Guidant/Cook
uses paclitaxel to coat its stents. But therein lies a problem.
Boston Scientific and Guidant/Cook squared off in court last week
over distribution rights for stents coated with paclitaxel, which is
made by a company called Angiotech Pharmaceuticals in Vancouver,
Canada. Although a federal court ruled in favor of Boston Scientific,
Guidant/Cook has vowed to appeal. Guidant is currently conducting a
trial of its paclitaxel stent in more than 1,000 patients in a study
called DELIVER, which is now in its follow-up phase. To a degree
unusual in medical circles, cardiologists believe that even the first
coated stents to reach the U.S. market will bring vast improvements
to America's heart patients. "Who knows?" says Edelman of MIT. "New
delivery strategies may bring us to the day when we not only do not
need coatings on stents, we may not need the stents, either."</TE>

<HD>Veggie-Loving Parents Make Nutrition a Family Affair</HD>
<DH>Eating: Jon and Susan Gerson are raising their young sons
to prefer the healthful foods with which their home is well stocked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL MORELLO</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to eating, the Gerson boys can make most parents feel
as if they must be doing something wrong.</LD>
<LD>   At 9, Eliot knows how to draw a detailed food pyramid, sketching
out the recommended servings of cereals, fruits and vegetables and
the very few servings of sweets and fats. Then he adds, deadpan, "I'd
prefer a fresh, juicy white peach to a strawberry ice cream." Scott
is 5, and while he hankers for gummy candies, he also counts broccoli
and spinach among his favorite foods. Many children his age can read,
but not many routinely read the nutrition labels on boxes and cans at
the supermarket, as Scott and Eliot do.</LD>
<LD>   Credit--or blame--their parents, Jon and Susan Gerson, who
consciously have conditioned them to crave fresh fruits and
vegetables the way other kids hunger for processed, nitrate-laden hot
dogs and deep-fried chicken nuggets. Junk food rarely enters their
house, which is in the Washington suburb of Kensington, Md.</LD>
<TE>   Refrigerator bins are loaded with veggies green and yellow and
red. Six varieties of apples nestle beside nectarines, apricots and
kiwis in the big wooden bowl on the kitchen counter. The pantry is
stocked with cans of black olives and chickpeas for snacking. The
frozen enchiladas are organic vegetarian.</TE>
<TE>   "If the choice is fries or beans, most kids will choose fries. But
if I only put out choices that I want them to eat, I don't have to
worry," says Susan of her philosophy that kids will eventually eat
what is put in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to ask yourself," she says, "at what point do kids
reject them? Or do parents stop serving them first?"</TE>
<TE>   That the Gersons' approach seems to have worked is nothing short
of awe-inspiring to any otherwise intelligent adult who has ever
engaged in a battle to get a waist-high person to just taste
something that smacks of produce. But even relative paragons of
gastronomic virtue such as the Gersons live in the same fat- and
sugar-sotted world as the rest of us. It's just that most people live
there full time; the Gersons are mere tourists in Sugarland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not young children are in the house, the eating habits
of most Americans would be graded, at best, "needs improvement."</TE>
<TE>   It's not for lack of information. The Agriculture Department has
designed the food pyramid as a guide to daily eating. Nutrition
groups have built advertising campaigns urging us to eat the right
things.</TE>
<TE>   But "nobody wants to eat food because it's good for them,"
Washington dietitian Katherine Tallmadge says. "People eat because
something tastes good." And so, a decade after the food pyramid made
its debut, six in 10 American adults are overweight, and a quarter
are considered obese. One child in eight weighs too much.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways it's easier to find nutritious food. Many
supermarkets carry exotic fruits, and even fast-food restaurants have
salad bars. But there are more temptations than there used to be, and
they come in bigger sizes. Just try to find a 6-ounce bottle of soda,
common only three or four decades ago. Now vending machines routinely
dispense 20-ounce bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the allure is genetic. Humans are born with a sweet tooth:
In one study, the faces of infants fed chocolate for the first time
lit up as if they were discovering joy itself. Given green beans,
they grimaced with a distinct yuck. Anthropologists say such
reactions are traceable to our hunting-and-gathering ancestors, who
used taste to distinguish between bitter plants that might be
poisonous and high-sugar foods that provided energy. Now the only
hunting and gathering we do is from a supermarket shelf jammed with
choices and calories.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time in our evolution as human beings, a lot of
food is easily available," says Tallmadge. "We don't have to go out
and catch it, skin it or forage for it. And it's really delicious.
It's sweet and salty and fatty. And we're eating larger portions."</TE>
<TE>   What is a parent to do? Banning junk food outright doesn't work.
Parents who treat sweets like controlled substances often end up with
children who eventually binge, studies have concluded. But growing
research on taste preferences suggests children can learn to like
vegetables. Leann Birch, a Pennsylvania State University researcher
who has studied finicky eaters--children who adamantly stick to the
same one or two foods, day after day--says it takes eight to 10
exposures to a vegetable before children overcome their innate fear
of new foods and try it.</TE>
<TE>   Nutritionists say the lesson is to be persistent and patient and
not get too hung up on rules that can rob eating of its fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty or 30 years ago there was a norm for family meals," says
Ellyn Satter, author of "Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family." "The
whistle blew at 6, and everybody went home. Now there's soccer
practice at 6. The norm is absolutely gone. What has come forward to
replace it is a bunch of rules. The food guide pyramid is so
meticulous overall that the message to the public is rigidity and
avoidance.</TE>
<TE>   "People today have all-or-nothing, sink-or-swim attitudes about
food. They feel if it's enjoyable, it can't be good for them. That
takes all the joy, all the motivation, all the reward out of family
meals."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Gersons somehow make vegetables and fruits seem both virtuous
and amusing. Dessert becomes a game, as the boys close their eyes and
try to guess what fruit their dad has popped into their mouths. On
family outings, the Gersons visit organic farms to pick berries and
talk to soybean farmers who make tofu. Cherry tomatoes are planted
alongside the patio for the boys to snack on when shooting hoops. On
their weekly boys' night out, father and sons favor a Mongolian
restaurant where diners select a meat and fresh vegetables, then
watch them being sauteed and scooped into a bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Gersons aren't focused exclusively on nutrition. Eating is not
just eating; it's part of a developed philosophy on the rearing of
high achievers. Susan, after all, is a child psychologist. Jon's
mother was one, too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's consistency, across the board," says Jon, "whether it's
using car seats and safety belts, bedtime by 8, exercising tight
control over the TV, having no weapons as toys and watching what gets
eaten. They all fit together in setting a kid up to be successful in
school and in his behavior and getting the habits ingrained early so
they feel more comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   The couple's approach is subtle. They don't make their sons clean
their plates or order them to eat anything they don't like. It would
seem almost laissez-faire, but a close inspection of their
refrigerator and pantry reveals how carefully each food item is
selected.</TE>
<TE>   The applesauce is unsweetened. The microwaveable wraps are stuffed
with tofu and carrots. A cardboard pint of what appears to be ice
cream turns out to be sorbet. Sticks of string cheese are low fat.
Ground meat for chili and spaghetti sauce is turkey, not beef. Juice
is 100% juice. Fruit is purposely kept in sight on the countertop
instead of hidden in the refrigerator so the boys can grab a piece in
passing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Gersons try not to be doctrinaire. There are foods that
simply cannot be avoided, maybe even shouldn't be avoided, and
situations in which the regime goes by the wayside. They go to
restaurants sometimes. When other children have birthday parties, the
Gerson boys get cake, too.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take them to Ocean City"--a Maryland beach resort--"you
can't say they can't eat what they see all around them," Susan says.
"There's nothing good to eat in Ocean City. You'd be hard-pressed to
find a vegetable. So you give in to it and have fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, as teens, the Gerson boys will become rebellious
chocoholics. Nutrition experts say the Gersons seem to be doing the
right thing, not forbidding or stigmatizing any particular foods, but
there are always risks. "When parents are too fanatical, it can
translate to eating disorders with children," says Tallmadge, the
dietitian.</TE>
<TE>   And even for the Gersons, not every day is a piece of cake. Peer
pressure to eat certain foods can get in the way. So can the stress
of daily life, when every gene seems to cry out for a candy bar to
grease the skids. You give in and use what works.</TE>
<TE>   Take the trail of M&amp;Ms and gummy candies that Jon admits he has on
occasion planted in a long, winding line up the stairs into the
bathroom, ending at the tub's faucet so the boys have to climb in to
reach the last one. It causes major issues to disappear with one shot
of sugar.</TE>
<TE>   But Jon's pride in his child management skills was deflated the
day Eliot came home from school with a note from his teacher. "We
need to talk about the use of sweets as an incentive for behavior,"
she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Busted.</TE>

<HD>Town Tries to Take a Stand Against Childhood Obesity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As parents, doctors and government officials debate how best to
intervene in the epidemic of obesity among American children, a few
schools are taking matters into their own hands--to the dismay of
some pediatricians.</LD>
<LD>   The Northern California school district of Hollister--like
communities in Pennsylvania and Florida--sends letters home to
parents of overweight or seriously underweight kids in kindergarten
and grades two, five and eight, recommending that the children be
seen by a doctor and change their diets.</LD>
<LD>   The letters go out when children fall above the 95th percentile
for height and weight, compared with 100 of their same-sex peers, or
below the 5th percentile.</LD>
<TE>   Parents or guardians are informed that "continuation of this
growth pattern may result in serious health problems, such as heart
disease, diabetes and/or malnutrition."</TE>
<TE>   A bill that would mandate parental notification statewide is
pending in Sacramento. AB 1905--introduced by Assemblyman John
Longville (D-Rialto) and passed by the Assembly--would require
California school districts to measure junior-high students' height
and weight and inform the families of any children who are at risk
for diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   The measurements would be conducted at the same time as checks for
spine curvature, called scoliosis.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say such letters could be an empty gesture--possibly
even making matters worse if the children feel stigmatized.</TE>
<TE>   Many kids may not have a regular doctor or access to health care,
and some parents resent the intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Kemp, a school nurse in the mostly agricultural community of
Hollister, defends the letters, which were her idea.</TE>
<TE>   Although the school district doesn't follow up or ask parents to
report back, she said: "I'm hoping that it's raising awareness, and
hopefully we can do more."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollister district, south of San Jose, began reporting
worrisome results to families three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   School officials routinely measure children's growth, Kemp said,
but "it doesn't do any good to measure kids and weigh them unless
they [parents] know what the results are."</TE>
<TE>   "The first year we got a lot of irate parents," she said. "Last
year we actually had some parents thank us for the letters."</TE>
<TE>   This year, the parents of underweight kids were the ones who
complained.</TE>
<TE>   Hollister's program was a response to a growing number of local
kids with Type 2 diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago there were only a couple of diabetic kids in the
2,300-child district; today there are more than 20, Kemp said.</TE>
<TE>   Hollister is located in San Benito County, which outranks every
other county in childhood obesity, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're focusing on the wrong thing. Focusing on the kid's body
is the perfect way to make eating disorders," according to Dr. Marc
Jacobson, a specialist in adolescent medicine at the Schneider
Children's Hospital Center for Atherosclerosis Prevention in New Hyde
Park, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "They're singling out certain kids, but from what we know about
the obesity epidemic, every kid is at risk. They're all eating poorly
and not getting enough physical activity.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to focus on habits and have to teach every kid--whether
they're skinny or normal weight or fat--how to eat right and how to
have some sort of exercise they can do for life, just like they teach
basic math or reading."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Francine Kaufman, head of pediatric oncology at Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles and the incoming president of the American
Diabetes Assn., welcomes programs that raise family awareness about
the links between obesity and disease, but called the letters home
"ridiculous until we can offer something for the families that might
want to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   The sale of junk foods in the schools--not to mention scaling back
physical education instruction--"is part of the reason these kids
have gotten obese. Until we can determine--and there are some
National Institutes of Health studies underway--the best way to do
this, it may be premature."</TE>
<TE>   Kemp said Hollister schools are trying to encourage kids to
exercise more by rewarding those who walk or run the track at lunch
or during recess.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that the schools have been trying to take the
highest-fat foods out of the snack bar, "but it's really
controversial because the school makes money selling snacks to kids.
We've just started looking at what we can do to help."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was a college instructor and a part-time grammar-school basketball
coach and knew how to manipulate kids. He drew them in with the
patience of a cat stalking its prey. When he knew they were
vulnerable, he leaped.</LD>
<LD>   Chuck Rosenthal sits in my office and talks about the man and
about six years of sexual abuse at his hands. He won't name him, he
said, and he's not going to sue anyone, because relief--not vengeance
or money--is what he's seeking. He wants to warn others about the
smiles that conceal the true nature of tigers, and he wants his soul
back.</LD>
<LD>   Rosenthal is 50 now and a successful novelist. He teaches creative
writing at Loyola Marymount College and lives not far from me in the
Santa Monica Mountains. I've known him for years as a steady,
no-nonsense kind of guy, part of a circle of writers who reside in
the tree-shrouded canyons.</LD>
<TE>   I wasn't ready for what he told me.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal was a grade-school student, a 13-year-old who
desperately wanted to play basketball. He lived in a small,
blue-collar town in Pennsylvania where sports was about the most
important thing on anyone's mind.</TE>
<TE>   The coach I'll call Mr. Ex was a balding, pot-bellied, ebullient
man who later became president of a small college. He was friends
with all the big-shots in town, including the mayor. He was also a
skillful sexual predator.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Mr. Ex told Rosenthal that he wasn't good enough to play
on the basketball team, but graciously offered to help get him into
shape. That's where it began.</TE>
<TE>   "He was full of high praise and heated condemnation," Rosenthal
said of the coach as we sat talking on a soft spring day. "If you
didn't perform well at basketball, he'd take you into a storage room,
pull down your pants and hit you with his hand." He paused,
remembering. "It was a slow process to physical transgression."</TE>
<TE>   Slow indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal loved athletics. Even in grammar school he played
football and was on the swimming team. Today he stands at 6 foot, 1
inch, and is as trim as any athlete.</TE>
<TE>   It was important for him to play on the basketball team and
important for him to be the best. Mr. Ex offered him a chance at
both. He flattered Rosenthal with special attention that included
massages in his apartment and, later, gifts--all the while lecturing
him on the value of honor and loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   That first time he ordered Rosenthal to strip for a massage, the
boy objected. Mr. Ex exploded and told him to get out, his career in
basketball was over.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to play basketball, so I let him," Rosenthal said. "I
was a kid. What did I know?"</TE>
<TE>   From there, it progressed to a manipulation of his genitals,
always for reasons of releasing his muscle tension. He was doing the
same, Rosenthal said, to other students too, but they never talked
about it with one another, aside from veiled references to "weird
things" Mr. Ex would do. Rosenthal felt he couldn't tell his parents,
and they never found out. The terrible secret would stay locked in
his heart for years.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal was 14 when he admitted to himself that he was having
sex with his basketball coach. He tells me about it in a
matter-of-fact tone, missing nothing, opening up to me in detail, as
he had promised he would.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what to do," he said, pausing momentarily as though
I might offer a solution or ridicule him or not believe. "He was
buying me clothes and taking me on trips. He helped get work for both
my mom and dad. He even got my sister into college."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Ex also gave him liquor at 14, a habit, Rosenthal admits, that
led to an addiction, not only to booze but also to drugs. It lasted
for years and precipitated a behavior that at times seemed suicidal,
including a jump from a 20-foot tower.</TE>
<TE>   When the "game" turned to sex, Rosenthal said, he imagined himself
being a woman yielding to a man, rather than a young boy being raped
by a predator.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept going back to him," he said, in obvious anguish. "I
thought I loved him, and he convinced me I needed him."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal quit seeing Mr. Ex when he was 19, after learning that
his younger brother, also a basketball player, was receiving "special
treatment" from the coach. They quit at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   After years of counseling, a failed marriage and God knows how
much inner torment, Rosenthal left Pennsylvania and settled here. He
is married to a poet, Gail Bronsky, and has told her everything. The
marriage, he said, saved him.</TE>
<TE>   One can wonder why it took so long for him to be rid of the man
who had so utterly defiled him. Conflicting emotions kept him there,
seduced by the hypnotic power of a Svengali who knew how to bide his
time, and how to give and take in the proportions that would empower
him while weakening his prey.</TE>
<TE>   The coach mixed pleasure, shame and guilt to seduce the boy, said
Dr. Penelope Trickett, a USC expert on the impact of sexual abuse on
children. A victim's thinking becomes distorted, she said, and he
disassociates himself from the abuse. "It's as if he's watching
what's going on and not actually participating."</TE>
<TE>   The coach, Rosenthal said, is old and sick now, and he is leaving
him to die with whatever peace his conscience will allow. He is a
threat to no one anymore. Rosenthal is talking about it as a warning
to others, and as a way too, I suppose, of quelling the demons that
emerge in the stillest hours of the mind's night.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For a little diversion one day this summer try laughing at the rich.
Because in "The Nanny Diaries," by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus,
the rich come off as self-involved and silly. (Random House Audio;
abridged fiction; three cassettes; 5 hours, 15 minutes; $25; read by
Julia Roberts.)</LD>
<LD>   This debut novel by two former nannies holds no surprises, but is
still funny and breezy escapism. Roberts delivers the novel's humor
with much elan, especially the sarcastic thoughts of the protagonist,
an overworked New York nanny. However, she is much better at assuming
attitude than donning a dialect; just as in her movies, Roberts'
accents fall flat and are often unrecognizable.</LD>
<LD>   Click, Download, Read</LD>
<TE>   More humor can be found in the latest from Calvin Trillin in an
audio available only by downloading it from the Internet, which is
actually easier to do than it sounds. It's worth the effort because
"Tepper Isn't Going Out" is another clever and witty diversion by
Trillin at about half the price of most audio books. (Random House
Audible; unabridged fiction; 5 hours, 30 minutes; $14.95; read by
Trillin. For information, go to www.audible.com.)</TE>
<TE>   This is a tale of a man who upsets the balance of nature by
sitting in his New York parking spot for hours at a time. Tepper is a
sweet, older guy who just likes to read his paper in the car, but
soon becomes the scourge of a vindictive mayor and is turned into a
sage by the press. Trillin, who has an impossibly deep voice and
precise timing, enhances the humor with his deadpan delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen King's World</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be summer without Stephen King, but this year's
horrifying offerings are a mixed bag. "Everything's Eventual: 5 Dark
Tales," blends horror, whimsy and fantasy, but with middling results.
The production is superb, as the readers are all top-notch narrators,
and interesting music is used to break up the stories. Unfortunately,
only a couple of those stories rise above the average. (Simon &amp;
Schuster Audio; unabridged short stories; six cassettes; 7 hours, 30
minutes; $35; read by Boyd Gaines, Judith Ivey, Justin Long, Oliver
Platt and Jay O. Sanders.) These were culled from the book's print
version, which contains 14 stories.</TE>
<TE>   Much more interesting is a novella taken from the same print
collection and released separately. King's "Riding the Bullet" was
first published as a highly successful e-book and is a creepy,
old-fashioned ghost story. Though his Down East accent is a bit
zealous, Josh Hamilton is a lively narrator well matched to the
material for his age and manner. (Simon &amp; Schuster Audio; unabridged
short story; two cassettes; 2 hours; $20.)</TE>
<TE>   Pulitzer Winner Delivers</TE>
<TE>   Pulitzer Prize winner Carol Shields will slake your hunger for
literary fiction this summer with her thoughtful exploration of a few
dark months in the life of a Toronto-based writer. In "Unless: A
Novel," she explores the effects a teenage daughter has on her mother
when the girl drops out of society and takes a place on a street
corner, begging bowl in hand. (Harper Audio; unabridged fiction; six
cassettes; 7 hours, 30 minutes; $32.95; read by Joan Allen.)</TE>
<TE>   With the ability to let us hear the steel under her velvety voice,
Allen turns in a sublime performance. Her French accent is right on
target and she expresses, without melodrama, the angst of a
middle-aged woman who begins to question her life. Tinkling piano
music introduces each tape in this fine production.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchhiker's Leftovers</TE>
<TE>   Admirers of the late, much missed Douglas Adams will be overjoyed
at the release of "The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One
Last Time." If you are not a fan, you may be scratching your head as
to why others are so excited about a collection of the flotsam and
jetsam found in Adams' many Macintosh hard drives after his death at
age 49. (New Millennium Audio; unabridged fiction and nonfiction; six
cassettes; eight hours; $34.95; read by Simon Jones with Christopher
Cerf, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Fry.)</TE>
<TE>   The audio consists of essays, excerpts from interviews, letters
and a portion of his unfinished final novel, the third book in the
Dirk Gently Holistic Detective Agency series. A lot of this is funny
stuff and is delivered with much good humor by Simon Jones, who has a
way with irony. However, if you have never heard one of Adams'
imaginative, humorous science fictions, better to start with "The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and work your way up to "Salmon."
(New Millennium has recently re-released all five volumes of the
Hitchhiker "trilogy.")</TE>
<TE>   Parallel Universe</TE>
<TE>   Reminiscent of Adams' work is "The Eyre Affair" by Jasper Fforde,
a novel that has been described as "Umberto Eco meets Harry Potter."
It is set in a parallel universe that looks like England, circa 1985,
only Wales is self-governing, dodos have been resurrected through a
popular cloning program and Surrealists and Impressionists are known
to riot.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday Next is the sassy detective hot on the trail of Acheron
Hades, a dastardly chap who kidnaps characters from beloved novels
and has set his sights on Jane Eyre. (HighBridge Audio; unabridged
fiction; six cassettes; 10 hours; $34.95; read by Elizabeth Sastre.)</TE>
<TE>   Fun, funny and imaginative, this works extremely well on audio,
flowing at a quick pace and clever enough to keep us intrigued.
Sastre has a youngish, pretty voice and easily alters her pacing and
accent for various characters. Her energy and intelligent
interpretation of the material enhances its humor.</TE>
<TE>   Abridged Whodunit</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to decide which version of "Jolie Blon's Bounce"
by James Lee Burke to recommend. Will Patton, who has read every
installment in this Dave Robicheaux detective series, narrates the
abridged version. A lazy Louisiana accent drips from his tongue. His
performance is spirited and each of the characters in the book has a
clearly defined vocal persona. However, the truncated version is
sometimes choppy and difficult to follow. It also lacks the vibrant
rendition of the title song included in the unabridged version.
(Simon &amp; Schuster Audio; four cassettes; six hours; $26.)</TE>
<TE>   The unabridged version flows more smoothly and is simply a better
story, though Mark Hammer's able narration is not equal to Patton's.
Oddly, the introduction in the unabridged version, read by the
author, is less interesting than the one included in the shorter
audio. So, it really is a tossup as to which version is more
enjoyable. (The unabridged version is nine cassettes; 15 hours; $45.)</TE>

<HD>Finding Words to Keep Family on Speaking Terms</HD>

<LD>Why do grown women often feel criticized by their mothers, while
mothers feel they cannot utter a word to their daughters? Why does a
wife feel attacked when her husband asks her to keep the drain open
in the sink? Why is it so hard to get an apology from a family
member? Why do adult children still compete for their parents' love?</LD>
<LD>   Georgetown University linguist Deborah Tannen takes on these
questions and the workings of family conversational styles in her
latest book, "I Only Say This Because I Love You: Talking to Your
Parents, Partners, Sibs, and Kids When You're All Adults" (Random
House, 2002). Tannen, author of the bestselling "You Just Don't
Understand ... ," which explored the mechanisms of gender differences
in conversation, spoke at the Richard J. Riordan Central Library in
Los Angeles on Wednesday. About 80 people ignored the final NBA
championship series game to hear her.</LD>
<TE>   "The family is the source of our greatest comfort but also our
greatest pain," said Tannen, who used taped conversations of families
with adult children living at home that were logged and then analyzed
for the purposes of her two-year study. "Instead of intimate allies,
sometimes we find the intimate critic. We often accuse people of
making power plays in conversation but we are far less likely to
think of a comment as [an attempt at] connection." All conversations,
writes Tannen, are driven by the forces of connection and control,
intertwined and often conflicting elements woven through much of
family conversation. "We use talk to get closer to each other or to
put distance between us," she writes, and the words people choose
help to gain dominance or show respect.</TE>
<TE>   "Any close relationship is a delicate blend of connection and
control," Tannen said by phone a day after her Los Angeles event.
(She was already in Seattle for her tour.) "But connection and
control are expressed in the same words. When a mother says to her
daughter: 'Those pants don't flatter you' she is thinking
'connection': 'I love you, I say this because I care about you and
want to help.' But the [adult] daughter will think her mother is
trying to control her and her appearance." Or criticize her. The
modus operandi "I care, therefore I criticize" is at work in some
families, Tannen writes. The person offering "suggestions or
judgments" often does so in the spirit of caring. But the person
being asked or told to do something differently hears, with what he
or she believes is utter clarity, a criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Tannen writes about a young woman from Thailand who recalled that
her mother would end talks with her daughter with this justification:
"I have to complain about you because I am your mother and I love
you. Nobody else will talk to you the way I do because they don't
care." Emotions are the currency of family relationships, Tannen
writes. But the key to plumbing the source of hurt and conflict in a
remark is separating the messages from the "metamessages." The
message is the literal meaning of the words, which two people usually
can agree upon. ("Can you take out the trash?" is not, for example,
up for interpretation.) But the metamessage is the implied meaning
embedded in the context, tone of voice, how it plays in the history
of the relationship and the fact that it is said at all. Metamessages
are the "heart meaning," laden with emotions that trigger people's
intense reactions.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, Tannen and her older sister took their
93-year-old father and their mother, 90, to an elegant restaurant.
Their father's filet mignon was tough and Tannen could see he
couldn't chew it. "You don't have to eat it," Tannen yelled, because
of his hearing impairment and because she was sitting some distance
away. "We can send it back." After a few rounds of this, Tannen's
sister snapped: "I can't stand it. You are driving me crazy. Leave
him alone." Tannen was angry and hurt that her sister yelled at her
in a nice restaurant. "I was fuming for about a day," she said. "All
I wanted her to do was say she was sorry and admit some blame. A day
later, we talked and she kept justifying why she had snapped. She
kept going on and on about why I was bothering her. Once I said, 'I
can understand why you felt annoyed,' and told her that I loved her
and felt [her behavior] was a temporary lapse and that it hadn't made
me forget how wonderful she was, she apologized."</TE>
<TE>   That conversation drove the other to exaggerated forms of
antagonistic behavior. This can happen especially when one person is
fixated on extracting an apology and the other is equally adamant
about not apologizing. Anthropologist Gregory Bateson called this
"mutually aggravating spiral" complementary schismogenesis, writes
Tannen. (A schism is a split, and genesis is creation).</TE>
<TE>   Men often resist apologizing, said Tannen, because they tend to
view apologies as a sign of weakness and submission. "Men often
operate on the indirect way of apologizing," said Tannen. "A
wonderful example of this was Evander Holyfield, who is quoted in a
recent Wall Street Journal article saying that he forgave Mike Tyson
for biting [a piece of] his ear off because [at the time, Tyson] 'did
this little wave, this nod. That tells he was wrong.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the smallest suggestion or correction has the power to
explode into a row if the recipient has a history of feeling
criticized. When a wife points out to her husband that salmon is on
the menu, an example Tannen uses in the book, her husband responds:
"Will you please stop criticizing what I eat?" (Family or spouses who
act as food police, diet police and neatness police are constant
irritants to the policed, said Tannen.) The wife's question about
whether or not her husband noticed the salmon on the menu is not a
literal criticism, but Tannen explains that conversations between two
people have a history as part of an ongoing relationship. The
metamessage the husband heard is that his wife thinks he eats too
much red meat and too much in general, Tannen explains, but that is
the paradox of control and connection; the wife interferes and judges
(control) because her life is linked with his (connection).</TE>
<TE>   So how can people talk to each other so that family conversations
are fulfilling, less circular and lead to fewer fights? One approach
is called reframing: talking in a different way to change the meaning
of an interaction. Instead of giving advice, people should try
offering understanding. And when advice is offered, say from a
sibling, try interpreting it as if it were a suggestion from a peer,
writes Tannen. Sometimes, an argument can be defused if two people
can become aware of differing conversational styles, which may just
make it easier to understand how we misunderstand.</TE>
<TE>   "Being aware doesn't prevent these things from happening, but my
husband and I have really worked out that apology thing," Tannen
said. "I would get so angry because he wouldn't apologize. He would
get so angry because I was demanding an apology. Now I have realized
that he will not do it on demand and that if I just wait, he will do
it later. Or do it indirectly."</TE>

<HD>Historical Novel About Nuremberg Trials Falls Short</HD>
<DH>NUREMBERG: THE RECKONING: A Novel, By William F. Buckley
Jr., Harcourt, 368 pages, $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERLE RUBIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Crimes Against Humanity; such as murder, extermination, enslavement,
deportation, and other inhumane acts against civilian populations."
This, along with criminal mistreatment of POWs, conspiracy to wage
aggressive war and waging aggressive war, was the charge leveled at
such key members of the Third Reich as Hermann Goering, Albert Speer,
Julius Streicher and Joachim von Ribbentrop at the Nuremberg Trials
in 1945. The sheer monstrosity of the crimes and the massiveness of
the scale on which it was done were something unprecedented in
history.</LD>
<LD>   The decision of the victorious Allies (in particular, the U.S. and
Britain) to hold Nazi war criminals accountable for their actions
before an ad hoc tribunal engendered a certain amount of criticism.
The Russians would have preferred to kill the culprits without a
trial, as part of the military process of war. A trial might give the
Nazis too much of a forum. It might also create a precedent, enabling
victors of future wars to claim the right to condemn their defeated
enemies as "criminals" for acts less heinous than genocide.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, in the final analysis, the case for holding the Nuremberg
Trials seems overwhelmingly clear: the magnitude of the crime cried
out for some attempt, however inadequate, at punishment. Pursuing
justice through an orderly legal process would affirm civilized
values. And it would also affirm that there are higher, more
universal, moral values.</TE>
<TE>   In his latest novel, "Nuremberg: The Reckoning," the erudite and
engaging conservative pundit (or should one say icon?) William F.
Buckley Jr. attempts to give us a fictional version of this momentous
event. It is certainly quite a departure, in subject, style and tone,
from his popular spy novels. But, alas, it does not add much to our
understanding of its subject, nor does it really succeed on purely
novelistic grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The task Buckley has set himself is admittedly difficult, but not
impossible, as demonstrated by Stanley Kramer's gripping 1961 film
"Judgment at Nuremberg." But where Kramer wisely chose to dramatize a
trial with fictional characters (albeit based on some of the later
trials that actually took place at Nuremberg), Buckley mingles
portraits of real-life personages (like defiantly unrepentant Goering
and Supreme Court Justice-turned-prosecutor Robert Jackson) with
fictional characters.</TE>
<TE>   The central character is the fictional Sebastian Reinhard, a young
German-American serviceman serving as a translator at the trials and
preliminary questionings. Although Sebastian has some brief
encounters with real-life figures, most of his dealings are with
another fictional character: accused war criminal Kurt Waldemar
Amadeus, who knows what happened to Sebastian's father, Axel, who was
forced to stay behind in Germany after his wife and son fled in 1939.
Perhaps the biggest mistake on Buckley's part, in terms of historical
verisimilitude, was making the fictional Amadeus an actual defendant
at this trial of two dozen notorious characters.</TE>
<TE>   Buckley effectively intersperses Sebastian's experiences at
Nuremberg in 1945 with scenes from his family's past. Indeed, the
novel opens quite dramatically in Hamburg, 1939, with 13-year-old
Sebastian and his parents secretly planning their departure for
America. This part of the novel, dealing with Sebastian's complicated
family background and the father's fate, is a good deal more
inventive and absorbing than Buckley's disappointingly lackluster
version of the famous trial.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Woolf once said that she found the most difficult aspect
of writing a novel was getting one's characters from one place to
another. This also seems to be a problem for Buckley here: too much
attention to rote scene-shifting as Sebastian makes his way from
Arizona to military training in Georgia to Nuremberg; not enough
attention to character portrayal or the weighty issues of law,
morality and the nature of humanity that come with the subject
matter.</TE>
<TE>   A dispiriting number of scenes are filled with filler like this
account of Sebastian's first glimpse of Landers, the chief warrant
officer: "He lifted a bulky folder and leafed through mimeographed
pages. He dialed again. 'Sergeant, this is Chief Landers of Justice
Jackson's office. The Justice is looking for Major Gripsholm. He
doesn't answer his phone or his room number at the Grand. I wondered
if he might be with Colonel Andrus?....Yes, well. Yes, I know Colonel
Andrus doesn't like to be interrupted, but you'll have to get word to
Major Gripsholm that the Chief Prosecutor--' The bell rang again.
'Hang-on-a-minute.' The phone transfer was done .... 'Yes sir? I
think I've located him, Justice....' "</TE>
<TE>   Even the very poignant and harrowing story of Axel Reinhard's
experiences in Nazi Germany is marred by this kind of filler. And the
novel's ending seems a serious miscalculation as to what readers will
find climactic. It is built upon Amadeus' last revelation--and
request--to Sebastian. The analogy that the unrepentant Amadeus draws
between two condemned men--Sebastian's father, killed by the Nazis,
and himself, facing execution--is clearly a false one, so that
Sebastian's last-ditch efforts to extend a small act of mercy toward
this villain make for an ending that is more of whimper than a bang.</TE>

<HD>Even Fun Is Sugar-Coated</HD>
<DH>Up next in the anything-goes world of confection? A pop-out
toothbrush with candy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY HEVRDEJS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>In the sticky world of Nerd Ropes, Hot Tamales, Warp Hyper-Charged
Energy Mints, FizzUrps and Sour Apple Stinky Feet, Jay C. Pearlman
has found a niche.</LD>
<LD>   So there he was, amid the 450 candy makers at the National
Confectioners Assn. here recently. The young entrepreneur, his mop of
curly hair bouncing as he talked, explained to folks exactly why his
new gadget--a toothbrush that pops out of a dolphin or shark
mouth--comes in a package with a plastic packet of red powder.</LD>
<LD>   "The powder? It's dextrose. Cherry-flavored," says Pearlman, 30.
"When you put it in your mouth, everything turns blue."</LD>
<TE>   And then?</TE>
<TE>   "The toothbrush pops out of the mouth of a dolphin or shark and
you brush your teeth," Pearlman says.</TE>
<TE>   A toothbrush?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a joke--candy with a toothbrush," he says. "So the kids are
going to like it. And the parents won't mind buying something like
this because, OK, it is candy but at least they're getting a
toothbrush. So maybe they'll brush their teeth."</TE>
<TE>   So how did you come up with this idea? In your garage? In your
bathroom?</TE>
<TE>   "On an airplane," Pearlman says. "And then I started working with
my contacts in China and we worked on it together."</TE>
<TE>   That Pearlman dreamed up a candy-toothbrush combo doesn't surprise
John Stanton.</TE>
<TE>   "Candy has always been on the leading edge of the fun side of the
food business," says Stanton, a food marketing professor at St.
Joseph University in Philadelphia. "It's almost like consumers have
given candy a license to go ahead and be a little crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, sales of novelty candies (products that combine a toy with
a treat) grew 8.7% in 2001 and 68% during the last five years, making
its growth second only to the sugar-free gum category in the
multibillion-dollar candy business, according to the National
Confectioners Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers--read: $$$--have caught the attention of the rest of
the food industry. "All the different [food] categories are trying to
get a piece of the fun business," says Stanton, citing purple ketchup
and pink margarine.</TE>
<TE>   That ups the ante for the candy business. "If the rest of the
[food] industry starts doing all of these things," Stanton says, "the
candy industry is going to lose a little of its pizazz."</TE>
<TE>   Not if Pearlman can help it. He plans to launch the Candy Pop Out
Toothbrush in July. How it fares in the marketplace remains to be
seen.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wants to become a Hershey with a toothbrush and candy, it's
not going to happen," Stanton says. "On the other hand, if he can
have a really neat idea, and he can do this for three or four years
and--guess what?--he comes out with some other crazy thing two or
three years later, well....</TE>
<TE>   "There is probably always going to be a niche for novelty," says
Stanton, who estimates 90% of all new food products fail. "It's just
fun and fun sells. You know, people always say sex sells, but fun
sells more. You don't have to be too creative to figure out how to
make a sexy ad, but to come up with a novel idea you have to work a
little harder. And that's what some of these novelty candy companies
have done."</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman has no illusions about challenges in the candy business.
"You can't take on an 800-pound gorilla head-to-head," he says. "I
can't come out with a candy to try to take on Hershey. I've got to
niche my way around them."</TE>
<TE>   And that's why, "I knew I was going to have to own a company," he
says. "Listen, when you're a short Jewish kid, you know you're not
going get to play second base for the New York Yanks."</TE>
<TE>   He may not have the skills to field grounders, but he has the
pedigree for the Candy Pop Out Toothbrush. Born and raised in
Cleveland, Pearlman's dad worked for a large novelty candy company.
After graduating from Ohio State University with a degree in
business, Jay Pearlman joined the candy company where his father
worked. The young Pearlman left that company several years ago to
start a novelty toothbrush operation (Kabam Products). He holds the
patent on the pop-out brush. About a year ago, he started his candy
company, Ludo.</TE>
<TE>   But man cannot live on novelty alone. When Pearlman, who runs his
Cleveland-based business from Boca Raton, Fla., gets the munchies, he
craves "the basic American candies--Snickers bars, M&amp;Ms."</TE>

<LD>You don't have to have an easel, a canvas and an unusual subject to
create cool works of art. Your supplies and subjects can be simple
things.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Haring (1958-1990) was an artist who had a special gift for
using familiar subjects in exciting, creative ways. He didn't want to
make art just for museums and art collectors. He wanted his art to be
a part of everyday life. Rather than using a canvas, he painted on
unusual things such as empty posters in subway stations, his T-shirts
and even his tennis shoes. He used a few universal subjects over and
over in different combinations--a barking dog, a baby, a human figure
or a monster with a television set for a head. His subjects often
remind you of cartoon figures.</LD>
<LD>   Haring preferred people to come up with their own ideas of what
his paintings mean. Some of his paintings call to mind fanciful
stories. Others present a wide range of human emotions. All of his
works encourage viewers to push the limits of their imagination.</LD>
<TE>   Children can create art in the style of Keith Haring this Sunday
at 2 p.m. at the Skirball Cultural Center. They will also receive
free stickers to take home. For reservations, call (310) 440-4636 or
visit www.skirball.org.</TE>

<LD>"Alice's Adventures in</LD>
<LD>   Wonderland"</LD>
<LD>   by Lewis Carroll</LD>
<TE>   This was a very funny story based on a curious girl named Alice.</TE>
<TE>   Alice was sitting on the riverbank with her sister when she saw a
particularly curious white rabbit bouncing along the road. She got up
and followed the rather strange white rabbit down a very tiny rabbit
hole. That hole led Alice into the abnormal world of Wonderland.
There she met a very proud mouse, a caterpillar that made reasonable
but unreasonable remarks, a mad hare in a strange tea party and an
angry queen who seemed delighted with the prospect of chopping off
heads.</TE>
<TE>   Although this book is over 100 years old, I think other children
should read it because it will have them in a fit of giggles. It is
still popular even though it is quite old because Lewis Carroll left
his readers in suspense. "Why is everyone in Wonderland mad?"</TE>

<HD>A Love-In? Not Likely</HD>
<DH>San Francisco punks and yuppies don't exactly mingle--but
one man has an idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Punks and yuppies. Are they really so different? Al Cummings wants to
know.</LD>
<LD>   He wants to know what would happen if two of this city's most
entrenched cultural archetypes--young bohemians and young
capitalists--were to spend an afternoon together. And get drunk
together. And maybe mix it up in, oh, a lighthearted little
yuppie-punk smackdown--"dyed blond versus dyed black, Prada versus
Ben Davis," as Cummings describes the most current incarnations. He
wants to know: Would it improve civic relations? Would it build
bridges?</LD>
<LD>   Also, crucially, would hotties from both sides hook up with you if
you won?</LD>
<TE>   In some cities, such questions might stop where they started--in
the 25-year-old mind of a T-shirted, unemployed
temp/electrician/stand-up comedian who lives over the Taqueria
Can-Cun with his sister, a musician and a computer guy. It would be
noted that every city with an uptown crowd has an equal-but-opposite
downtown crowd, and no more would be said about it.</TE>
<TE>   But this isn't just any city. This is a city whose young singles
have spent several years now disparaging each other as antisocial
"punks" and shallow "yuppies," thanks to a dot-com boom that hurled
them by the tribal thousands into a vicious battle for apartments,
parking, restaurant food, cabs, barstools and just about every other
urban amenity, including space on the sidewalk. Long after the boom's
end, the rage of the displaced has lingered.</TE>
<TE>   Thus on July 13 in Golden Gate Park, Cummings plans to emcee an
event that has generated more interest among 20-somethings than a
citywide happy hour with free food: an "Olympics" in which the
punk-filled Mission District, in the heart of the city, and the
trendy Marina, four miles away on its yuppified north side, compete
in a series of tongue-in-cheek contests.</TE>
<TE>   The aim: to end the post-dot-com war of the stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just tired of all this tension," said Cummings, lounging one
recent workday in his Mission District apartment, a decrepit,
four-bedroom affair whose living room features a futon, a barber
chair, a bong, a wall full of electronic equipment, numerous
keyboards and a concrete duck. "If either group goes into the other
group's scene at all, you get this cold shoulder, this vibe. What I
want to say is that this isn't just a city for Marina-type people or
for Mission-type people. This should be a city for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Internecine rivalries are nothing new in San Francisco, a city of
fierce neighborhood identification from North Beach to Nob Hill.
Beatniks and bankers have scoffed at each other almost from the
moment the city was founded. But matters became openly hostile in the
late 1990s as housing costs were driven up by the high-tech gold
rush. The hardest-hit sections of the city were those that were most
popular with the young dot-commers--the clean, well-lighted,
apartment-filled Marina and the cheap, colorful, apartment-filled
Mission.</TE>
<TE>   Always on the pricey side, the Marina saw rents in its
half-mile-square sector rise to the size of middle-class
mortgages--$2,500 a month and more for an ordinary two-bedroom
apartment. Meanwhile, creative types in the more sprawling Mission
found themselves driven from their old haunts as Marina refugees
outbid them for even the humblest flats. Locals blamed techies and
"bourgeois bohemians," who, when confronted, said they had just
wanted to be around the "cool" people. Tensions deepened, however,
with every new sign of growth and gentrification. Humvees and
four-star restaurants began sprouting on blocks that formerly had
been known for local characters and good burritos. Galleries, studios
and rehearsal spaces began to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   The city split badly. When one Mission Street dance troupe left in
2000 following the sale of its building, demonstrators occupied the
place and the story made national headlines. For more than a year on
Market Street, the words "Yuppie Go Home" reappeared like a chronic
rash on a street-level Gap billboard. Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the
city's poet laureate and Beat Generation celebrity, wrote in the San
Francisco Chronicle that his town had become "an artistic theme park,
without artists." Slow-growth measures were put on the ballot, and
when they failed, city politicians who were perceived to be
pro-dot-com were voted out.</TE>
<TE>   Some hoped that the bruises would heal when the economy softened.
And they did, a little, as the tech bust proved to be an
equal-opportunity font of joblessness. But one of the city's better
social barometers, the Internet bulletin board Craigslist, still is
riddled with Mission-Marina trash talk, and one of the longer-running
chain e-mails is an ever-evolving joke list of Mission and Marina
disses. ("You know you're a Marina chick when you know that red is
the 'new black,' " reads one. "You know you're a disgusting
Alterna-chick when black is ALWAYS the new black," retorts the
version aimed at Mission dwellers. Moreover, people on both sides of
town say, there remains little personal interaction.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really go to the Mission much," confessed Emily Boyd, a
25-year-old, laid-off investment banker, sitting in a Jamba Juice bar
in the Marina one recent day. "I don't really know anybody down
there."</TE>
<TE>   "It's true," agreed her friend, Lorelei O'Hagan, 26, who still has
her investment banking job but was taking a mental-health day. The
women were both blond, both articulate, both ponytailed, both in
workout gear and both sipping the same mango drink with a vitamin
"fem-boost." O'Hagan, however, had recently been to the Mission, to
the backyard barbecue of a friend who recruited for the Peace Corps.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco is very diverse, but depending on where you are,
you may never see it," said O'Hagan. "We all work--or worked--at the
same places and we all go to the same restaurants. The Marina can
be--what's the word I want?--homogenous."</TE>
<TE>   It is that homogeneity, in both cultures, that inspired Cummings
one day during an Internet job hunt. Clicking around Craigslist in
search of the job board, he says, he found himself stumbling
repeatedly over Mission-Marina insults.</TE>
<TE>   "There were just all these obvious conflicts," he said, "and I
just wanted to see people get along. I know it sounds like a bad '80s
film, but I thought, 'We should duke this out on the drinking table
instead of bashing each other.' Also I thought it would be cool if I
could get a kind of poor-boy-meets-rich-girl date out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Cummings posted a message that day on the Web site's events board,
proposing a Marina-Mission "drinking Olympics" with such events as a
"Zima vs. Olde English" contest in which the two groups chugged their
signature beverages. He expected to be ignored. Instead, he has been
deluged with e-mails, from sponsorship offers to event suggestions.
(One correspondent wanted to give spray paint to yuppies and
calculators to punks for a tagging versus basic accounting contest.
Another suggested an "SUV versus '60s vintage car race" and a "fake
tans versus tats" (comparison of bronzers and tattoos). Media
inquiries came in from Seattle, Toronto, Britain and Omaha.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really enjoying my 15 minutes," said Cummings, laughing, as
friends milled in and out last week, noshing on Mexican takeout. "But
really, I just want to put aside the differences."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to put aside differences," shot back Allison Muir, a
26-year-old unemployed filmmaker with a tattoo, dyed hair and a
picture of the British punk girl-group "The Dirty Burds" on her
T-shirt. "I want to win! I want to embarrass and humiliate someone!"</TE>
<TE>   Muir said that after the dot-com wave hit her corner of the
Mission, she found herself "paying $600 a month to live in half of a
dining room that didn't even have a floor in it. And meanwhile, my
friends were all getting clipped on their scooters by Marina people
who were coming down here, slumming in their SUVs."</TE>
<TE>   In the Marina, Boyd and O'Hagan were more conciliatory. They said
the party sounded intriguing, not least because of the financial
insecurity they now share with Cummings and his friends. Boyd
recently moved in with her boyfriend to save on rent during her job
search. O'Hagan, who used to do her eight-block commute by cab, now
walks to work and counts every penny.</TE>
<TE>   "There are differences" in the two neighborhoods, "but they're not
as extreme as they used to be," said O'Hagan, who noted that she
hadn't gone shopping for clothes "in at least three months."</TE>
<TE>   Cummings has a city permit allowing for 125 contestants in his
Olympics and plans to pass out fliers around the city, though he adds
that he'll be surprised if anyone but his friends shows up.
Nonetheless, he thinks he has a good pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be a funny moment in San Francisco," he wrote on one
posting, daring punks and yuppies to give peace a chance here. "Or
possibly a drunk moment we will forget for the rest of our lives."</TE>

<HD>What Rolling Stone Hopes to Gather Next</HD>
<DH>Media* The magazine, long known for its ambitious articles,
hires an editor with an eye on younger readers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shove over, you middle-aged boys, with your Bics burning at Bruce
Springsteen concerts, your thinning hair, your love of 6,000-word
dispatches from Tom Wolfe and other gonzo authors.</LD>
<LD>   It's not about you anymore, and hasn't been for some time.</LD>
<LD>   Last week your literary icon, Rolling Stone magazine, was handed
off by its celebrated founder, Jann Wenner, to a new generation that
prefers word bites to complete works, that surfs with browsers and
manipulates zappers the way you obsessed over Mick and Keith, Jimi
and Janis through a dopey haze.</LD>
<TE>   Wenner named a new editor, Ed Needham, an Englishman who two years
ago came to New York to start a U.S. version of FHM (For Him
Magazine), now the nation's fastest-growing magazine with a
circulation of more than 1 million. Needham replaces Robert Love, who
had been with the publication for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Magazines like FHM, Blender and Maxim have been elbowing Rolling
Stone at newsstands, hijacking its readers and advertisers. These
"laddie" magazines were invented by the British for young male
readers the way Rolling Stone was invented for a generation coming of
age 35 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The newer magazines specialize in raunchy, funny, short articles
as well as hodgepodge graphics and scantily clad women. They run
dozens of CD reviews per issue and feature endless tidbits about
bands and the lifestyles of boys who want to be men.</TE>
<TE>   While Needham has no intention, he says, of turning his back on
Rolling Stone's longtime readers, he does hope to better captivate
15- to 29-year-olds by "employing a little more magazine craft,
making it easier to get into a story."</TE>
<TE>   Needham, 37 and a graduate of Sussex University, says he is the
perfect example of a reader who doesn't have time for the ambitious
articles that made Rolling Stone unique.</TE>
<TE>   "I say 'I'll get back to it' but I never do because there just
aren't big enough holes in my day for readin' long stuff," he said
during a phone interview Friday. "I don't know what it was like in
the '50s, but clearly there weren't so many things demanding
attention from people."</TE>
<TE>   Wenner started Rolling Stone, in fact, in 1967 out of a grungy
office in San Francisco's meatpacking district. A 21-year-old
Berkeley dropout, he had a $3,000 loan from the family of his
then-girlfriend (now his ex-wife) and a belief that music was as
powerful a force in the culture as politics--and needed its own
legitimate form of journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he published seminal pieces by Wolfe, Hunter
Thompson and William Greider, illustrating them with photographs by
Annie Leibovitz and Richard Avedon. Kurt Loder and Greil Marcus
weighed in on music in a magazine that took an encyclopedic approach
to covering it.</TE>
<TE>   America's boomers--all 77 million of them--seem to be reverential
about their heyday and artists continue to pay homage to the era and
the magazine. The 2000 movie "Almost Famous," for example, is based
on director Cameron Crowe's years trying to become a critic, at age
15, for Rolling Stone and the influence a young journalist has on his
generation.</TE>
<TE>   But the magazine is now like a guy who knew he was cool in the
'60s, rebelled in the '70s, got rich in the '80s, stagnated in the
'90s, and finally has decided: It's time for a tuck.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the ravenous marketing machine that gave birth to
Rolling Stone began demanding something new. After dramatic growth
that capped its circulation at 1.25 million, the magazine began
sorting through its own mid-life crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The revered cover of the magazine, once reserved for the poets
laureate of rock--the likes of Bob Dylan and Neil Young--now
routinely features such frothy pop stars as Britney Spears, teen
movie actors and models who probably think the Summer of Love was an
old soap opera. But still revenues and circulation fell flat or
declined, as competition multiplied.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the music industry was continuing to explode so
much so that individual genres like country western or hip-hop were
producing more revenue than the entire industry did during the 1970s.
So publications popped up to cover each of them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become harder and harder, impossible in fact, to hold the
center of an industry and listenership that is so massive and so
fragmented," said Alan Light, who worked at Rolling Stone in the
early 1990s before launching Vibe in 1994 and then moving on to run
Spin in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Light is now trying to raise money to start his own music-oriented
magazine geared to the 30-plus age group.</TE>
<TE>   He was skeptical that simply by putting a younger, hipper editor
at the helm Wenner could reinvent his creation, which needs to
generate enough money to sustain its dependent multimillion-dollar
empire, Wenner Media Inc., which also publishes Men's Journal and Us
Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   "The success of a magazine like Maxim is not just about graphics,
but that they found a distinctive voice," Light said. "It's a club
you want to be part of.... I worry about all these men's and music
magazines blurring into eight titles doing exactly the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge for Wenner is to decide how hard he'll attempt
to hold onto his longtime followers.</TE>
<TE>   "How is the magazine going to cover the Stones tour this fall and
Springsteen's new album in July?" Light asked. "If they're really
going to push younger, is Jann going to say that's not big news? That
gets very personal to Jann."</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone's own Jon Katz, a contributing editor there and
longtime media critic, said he doesn't know of a magazine in the
world that can "appeal to a 14- and 50-year-old in the same issue."</TE>
<TE>   But Needham said, "I think there's plenty of room over time to
accommodate everybody's requirements.... There is still a fascination
in young people in the process of discovering music when they hear
the Beatles for the first time or Van Morrison. So we'll keep
covering them."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Rolling Stone has struggled to appeal to each new
generation, but the most recent one has been a tough sell because it
is trained on what Katz calls "hyper medium."</TE>
<TE>   "You have a whole group of young people raised on switchers and
zappers with short attention spans," Katz said. "They move rapidly
across screens from the Net to TV to video games and they don't read
ads and they are used to getting everything for free. That's not what
traditional magazines are about."</TE>
<TE>   Katz pointed out that Rolling Stone is in the difficult position
that all old media--newspapers, network television,
newsmagazines--are facing: "If you don't change, you age and perish.
If you do change, you risk blowing up your core identity and being
another graphic, flashy medium that anyone can replicate."</TE>
<TE>   Wenner, Katz said, waited a long time to change.</TE>
<TE>   "But if Rolling Stone doesn't somehow remain unique," he added,
"it won't have loyal readers."</TE>
<TE>   Media Week reporter Lisa Granatstein, who broke the story last
week about Needham's appointment, cautioned those who count Wenner
out, noting that his magazine has been declared obsolete many times,
yet it persists.</TE>
<TE>   "Jann knows his bread and butter is the young guys and he knows he
has to get sharper and shorter for them," she said. "That's who the
advertisers want and who better to get them for Jann than a guy like
[Needham] who has run these magazines successfully before--straight
from the source."</TE>
<TE>   And what Wenner also has going for him, apparently, is that it is
still not too "yesterday" for bands to want to appear on the cover of
Wenner's bi-weekly. It's still as much a validation as it was in 1973
when Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show, a debauched bunch of hippies,
sang these lyrics:</TE>
<TE>   Well, we big rock singers, we got golden fingers, and we're loved
everywhere we go.</TE>
<TE>   (That sounds like us)</TE>
<TE>   We sing about beauty and we sing about truth at ten thousand
dollars a show.</TE>
<TE>   We take all kind of pills to give us all kind of thrills but the
thrill we've never known</TE>
<TE>   Is the thrill that'll getcha, when you get your picture on the
cover of the Rolling Stone.</TE>

<LD>"Rachel!" Matt called. "Where are you?"</LD>
<LD>   "In the pantry!" Rachel called back.</LD>
<LD>   Matt went into the kitchen and poked his head into the pantry.</LD>
<TE>   "What are you doing in here?" he asked his sister.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel turned around. "We have to do a project for school, and I'm
looking for the macaroni."</TE>
<TE>   Matt shook his head. "I'm not going to ask what you're going to do
with the macaroni. You always come up with the weirdest projects!" he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it is," Rachel said. And she took the package of macaroni
off the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   "Why were you looking for me?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh!" Matt said. "There's a letter from Uncle Don. It's addressed
to both of us."</TE>
<TE>   He opened the envelope. There were three pieces of paper in it.
Matt read the top one out loud.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Rachel and Matt,</TE>
<TE>   I'm bringing a present for you on Saturday. But you will need to
get some things before then. Solve the enclosed crossword puzzle to
figure out what things you need to get--and then maybe you'll know
what the present is.</TE>
<TE>   Love,</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Don</TE>
<TE>   P.S. Solve the clues in the order I have written them.</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday!" said Rachel. "That's in three days!"</TE>
<TE>   Matt nodded. "That doesn't give us much time," he said. "We have
to get the puzzle solved and the things--whatever they are--here
before he comes."</TE>
<TE>   He looked at the other two sheets of paper. The crossword puzzle
grid was on one. The clues were on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "Rachel, you get a pencil," he said. "I'll read the clues out
loud."</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Rachel said. She put the macaroni on the counter.
Then she took the crossword puzzle from Matt, got a pencil and sat
down at the kitchen table. "I'm ready."</TE>
<TE>   "First clue," Matt read out loud. "No. 4 across. Dishes for soup
or cereal."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel thought for a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Then she printed the answer in the spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Do you know what word Rachel printed?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sue Alexander's fascination with crossword puzzles stems from a
love of words. She's been known to read the dictionary for pure

<HD>Small Label Has Own Stage at Festival</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that two of the Southland's biggest radio festival concerts--the
KROQ Weenie Roast and KIIS-FM's Wango Tango--are in the books, pop
fans can turn their attention to one of the summer's major touring
fests, the Vans Warped Tour, which opens Friday in Nampa, Idaho, and
hits L.A. with shows July 10-11 at the Coliseum, then moves to
Seaside Park in Ventura on July 12.</LD>
<LD>   This year's tour is special for siblings Richard and Stefanie
Reines, who started attending the Warped Tour as fans in 1995. Six
years ago they launched a small label, Drive-Thru Records, from a
bedroom of their Sherman Oaks home, and they have usually succeeded
in placing at least one of their acts on some portion of the Warped
Tour.</LD>
<LD>   But this year the label, now based in Woodland Hills, will feature
several of its punk, pop and emo bands on a stage of its own; it's
the first time the Warped Tour has included a stage dedicated to an
individual record label. Acts including Home Grown, Allister, the
Movielife, Rx Bandits, Finch and the Starting Line will perform on
the Drive-Thru stage, while a couple of higher-profile Drive-Thru
bands--pop-rockers Something Corporate and pop-punkers New Found
Glory--will be on Warped's main stage, along with such headliners as
Bad Religion, Flogging Molly, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and NOFX.</LD>
<TE>   "This year we wanted to get as many bands as possible on the tour
because we have so many releases coming out this summer," Richard
Reines says. "We thought, 'Let's call Kevin and see if he'll give us
our own stage.' We never in a million years thought he'd say yes."</TE>
<TE>   Says Warped founder Kevin Lyman, "This came about last October,
which is when we meet with all the labels to see which acts they're
pushing and how they feel about their roster. Richard and Stefanie
basically said, 'We want our whole roster on the tour.' I said that
was very unlikely, then they asked, 'What if we bring our own stage?'</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new thing. It's going to be interesting, but it has caused
some confusion in the industry."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Lyman said, it's been suggested a label can buy its
way into a featured spot on the tour, which this year has 48 dates
running through Aug. 18. Reines says that the Drive-Thru stage will
cost his company nearly $500,000 but that he believes it will be
worth it for the exposure his acts will get.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't consider it a buy-on if they're bringing an entire
stage," Lyman says. "That's a very expensive thing to do, and they're
footing the bill, which gave me even more respect for them. Instead
of doing tour support for all their bands on different tours, they're
just putting them all on one tour. It brings a whole separate new
attraction to the Warped Tour without cutting anyone else out."</TE>

<DH>At Wango Tango, women rule a diverse soundscape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of the reasons people moan about KIIS-FM (102.7) were on glaring
display at the Top 40 radio station's fifth annual Wango Tango
concert Saturday at the sold-out Rose Bowl: the relentless
self-promotion; the commercialism that filled the stadium's video
screens with ads for soft drinks and phone services; the airhead
mentality (this station makes Radio Disney sound like NPR) embodied
in the on-stage and on-screen appearances by its personalities.</LD>
<LD>   KIIS--and other stations with what's now called the "contemporary
hits radio pop" format--also takes a lot of heat for its musical
transgressions, and while it's true that it's harbored the
perpetrators of teen pop and has no qualms about serving up schlock,
the diversity of the Wango Tango lineup was an argument for leniency
on all counts.</LD>
<LD>   If nothing else, the female voice that's been all but shut down
at, say, alt-rock outlet KROQ was given free rein at Wango, with
everyone from Alanis to Ashanti, Pink to Paulina turning the
approximately 10-hour concert into a veritable Oxygen Network of pop
music.</LD>
<TE>   Marc Anthony, Craig David, Will Smith, Ja Rule and a few other
males constituted a squad of lonely guys swamped by those singers as
well as Mary J. Blige, Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton and
India.Arie. And, always looming like an iceberg in the dark, Celine
Dion.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Dion was mercifully and atypically restrained in her
brief performance, declining to unleash the full force of her
potentially overpowering voice.</TE>
<TE>   That left the excess to the likes of Mexico's Paulina Rubio,
packing her crossover aspirations into a skimpy two-piece number and
scampering all over the stadium, and No Doubt's Gwen Stefani, leading
her band ever deeper into a corner of cartoonish shtick.</TE>
<TE>   In this landscape of artificiality, reality doesn't always thrive,
and Alanis Morissette's intense, personal confessions, which are
devoured eagerly by her own audience, didn't seem to stir the crowd
too much. Aretha heiress Blige, whose soulful aggression was not to
be denied, and especially Pink were the artists who best bridged the
gap.</TE>
<TE>   Pink has the kind of fondness for glitz and flash that gets her
admitted to Top 40 land, but in her late-afternoon appearance, the
singer brought a sense of inner tension to her rock-edged material.</TE>
<TE>   She swaggered with a rock star's authority, but there was an
undercurrent of vulnerability in the roughness of her voice, and the
spontaneity in her phrasing suggested that even she wasn't entirely
sure what emotion might erupt next. There was also an unforced joy in
her spirit, and her closing duet with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler on her
corporate-rock soul ballad "Misery" was a highlight of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The question of artificiality and reality became Ozz-terized by
Kelly Osbourne, who got to perform her version of Madonna's "Papa
Don't Preach" because, as the daughter of Ozzy Osbourne, she's a
reality TV celebrity. In a moment of genuine reality (it seemed to
be, anyway), papa himself, the bleeping Prince of Darkness, came out
and embraced his daughter and waved to the crowd as she left the
stage. Happy Father's Day.</TE>
<TE>   As far as tracking the pop music currents, the fact that O-Town
and Aaron and Nick Carter were the only established teen-pop acts on
the bill suggests that KIIS is diving off that teetering bandwagon.
Its alternative--a brand of more "mature" artists from the adolescent
age group--was represented by earnest singer-songwriters Branch and
Carlton.</TE>
<TE>   KIIS programming also gets knocked for its indiscriminate
eagerness to please, but that sounds like sour grapes from people who
moan that radio is too rigid and unadventurous, but actually mean
that it doesn't play the kind of music they like. The station's
range--from hip-hop to teen pop to soul to rock--sounds like the
eclecticism of '60s pop radio, whose passing is always being mourned.</TE>
<TE>   The overall quality might be down, but with the potential of
Blige, Pink and others, it might be time to stop complaining and get
the party started.</TE>

<HD>Career Fallout for R. Kelly? Don't Bet On It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The headline spin on the recent Calendar story on R&amp;B singer R.
Kelly, indicted on child pornography charges, gives the distinct
impression that his career is now in terminal ruin ("R. Kelly Posts
Bail as Fallout Begins," by Greg Braxton and Geoff Boucher, June 7).
The career obituary for Kelly is premature.</LD>
<LD>   Well-publicized run-ins with the law have not harmed the careers
of singers and rappers such as Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and Jay-Z. Quite
the contrary, their ill-gained notoriety has made them bigger and
more bankable stars than ever.</LD>
<LD>   But why should anyone be surprised at that?</LD>
<TE>   In the past couple of years, the landscape has been littered with
rappers and singers such as Tupac Shakur, Nate Dogg, Naughty by
Nature, the Wu-Tang Clan's Ghostface Killah, Heltah Skeltah and Cocoa
Brovaz, who have been assaulted, murdered or run afoul of the law.
They reap fortunes from exploiting the violent, outlaw and sexually
rapacious image of black life.</TE>
<TE>   They sell millions of records, tapes and videos and have boosted
their music into a worldwide growth industry.</TE>
<TE>   Legions of rebellious young blacks, and nonblacks, happily shovel
out colossal dollars to revel in this image. Kelly is a near-textbook
example of how sexually lewd lyrics translate into untold wealth. He
owns a mansion and property in Chicago and Florida, and is spoken of
in the same breath as Oprah and Michael Jordan among Chicago's
wealthiest black elite.</TE>
<TE>   But in the process, young black artists such as Kelly rekindle the
vilest of racial and sexual stereotypes about young black males.
Their artistic degradation has had especially dangerous consequences
for black women. In Kelly's case, the victims of his alleged sexual
vandalism--as witnessed by settlements of other lawsuits accusing him
for having sex with underage teens--were black women. And his
sexually odious singles, "Feelin' on Yo Booty," "Bump 'n' Grind" and
"Your Body's Callin'," were virtual invitations to sexually trash
black women.</TE>
<TE>   But black women, especially young black women, have been the
victims of that and much more. Homicide now ranks as one of the
leading causes of deaths of young black females. A black woman is far
more likely to be raped than a white woman and slightly more likely
to be the victim of domestic violence than a white woman. Their
assailants are not white racist cops or Klan nightriders but black
males.</TE>
<TE>   The media often magnify and sensationalize crimes by black men
against white women, and ignore or downplay crimes against black
women. The Kelly case is another glaring example of that. The lewd
sex video was allegedly made in 1997, yet police and prosecutors have
just now gotten around to tossing the book at him for the alleged
crime. And no charges were filed against him in the other cases that
he subsequently settled, even though having sex with a minor is a
felony.</TE>
<TE>   What is even more galling is that some blacks cite a litany of
excuses, such as poverty, broken homes and abuse, to excuse the
sexual abuse and violence of top black male artists. These
explanations for the misdeeds of rappers and singers are phony and
self-serving. The ones who have landed hard in a court docket are
anything but hard-core, dysfunctional, poverty types.</TE>
<TE>   P. Diddy, who predated Kelly as the poster boy for music
malevolence, is college-educated and hails from a middle-class home.
He typifies the fraud that these artists are up-from-the-ghetto,
self-made men.</TE>
<TE>   When men such as Kelly commit or are charged with violent or
sexually assaultive acts, they leave a long trail of victims, cast
shame and disgrace on themselves and, worst of all, reinforce the
notion that young black males are indeed menaces to society.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly seems to grasp that disastrous fact. In an interview with
Black Entertainment Television, he wailed, "I'm not a criminal." For
now, he's right. He has yet to be convicted of any crime. But will
his sudden fall from grace, the desertion by his suddenly pious pals
in the music industry and the calls for boycotts of his music mean
that the hitherto adoring fans who slavishly elevate badly behaving
artists such as Kelly to demigods and put king's-ransom wealth in
their bank accounts also desert him in droves?</TE>
<TE>   The prospects aren't good. Informal polls and fan comments in The
Times article show that many of them will continue to buy his
records. And some black respondents even trotted out the tired claim
that he's another prominent black man victimized by whites, or turned
the tables and blamed the victim for his woes.</TE>
<TE>   This again goes to show that ill-gained notoriety will always
jingle some cash registers for an artist no matter what he says or,
worse, does. Fallout for Kelly? Don't bet on it.</TE>

<HD>Cuba's Delgado Returns With Pleasant Surprises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On his previous visit to Los Angeles for last year's ill-fated Latin
Grammy ceremony, Cuban singer-songwriter Issac Delgado was among the
top stars stranded here by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Under
infinitely less stressful circumstances, the Havana-based singer made
a commanding and joyful return appearance Friday night before a
capacity crowd at the Conga Room.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by his superb 14-piece orchestra, Delgado demonstrated why
he has remained one of the most appealing figures of this dazzling
generation of hyper-trained Cuban musicians. Exuding a low-key charm,
the former lead singer of NG La Banda (Cuba's pioneering timba band)
offered several welcome surprises. His two sets were more modulated
and textured than we've come to expect from modern Cuban bands, which
often overheat. Delgado slowed down occasionally, savoring the
delicious melody of "Amor Sin Etica" (Love Without Ethics), adorned
by a delicate solo guitar.</LD>
<LD>   The most rewarding surprise was the guest appearance of female
vocalist Haila Mompie, formerly with Cuba's Bamboleo, who displayed
her underappreciated prowess on two tunes from her tribute album to
Celia Cruz, "Bemba Colora" and "Sopita en Botella." The mellow-toned
Delgado joined her for an exquisite duet on "Pensamiento," an
old-fashioned bolero popularized by Mexico's Guty Cardenas in the
'30s.</LD>
<TE>   Delgado also previewed tunes from his latest album, still
unreleased here. He closed with the title cut from last year's Latin
Grammy nominee "La Formula." Delgado's clever composition turns the
usual salsa braggadocio ("I've got the formula") into a collegial
tribute to other great Cuban bands.</TE>

<LD>The three phases of the 24th Playboy Jazz Festival were on full
display Saturday in the opening performances of the two-day gala at
the Hollywood Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Any program that takes place over the course of more than eight
hours of literally nonstop entertainment is bound to experience
varying segments--both musically and experientially. For the Playboy
Festival, those segments have usually unfolded in afternoon,
dinner-hour and prime-time sequences. Saturday's program was no
exception.</LD>
<LD>   What was fascinating about the sequences, however, was the fact
that most of them contained, within their individual group of
artists, a stylistic range embracing everything from lighthearted
entertainment to introspective improvisational jazz.</LD>
<TE>   The day's festivities opened, for example, with a set from the
L.A. Multi-School Jazz Band, followed by a characteristically
energetic performance from singer Lavay Smith and her Red Hot Skillet
Lickers Band. Entertaining, yes. But the singing and playing of Smith
and her players--who are usually identified with the Swing revivalist
movement--reached well beyond the superficialities of the style and
into its hard-swinging roots.</TE>
<TE>   The Charles Mingus 80th Birthday Tribute Big Band, followed by
singer Nnenna Freelon, produced the segment's (and, in fact, much of
the day's) most invigorating jazz moments. Guided by Mingus' widow,
Sue, the Big Band has transited forward from an ensemble that
preserves Mingus' music to one that enhances and develops his musical
ideas in a fashion that would have pleased him.</TE>
<TE>   With sterling soloists, such as saxophonist John Stubblefield,
trumpeter Alex Sipiagin and trombonist/singer Ku-umba Frank Lacy
leading the way, the Mingus ensemble offered a powerful reminder of
the thrilling potential of big-band jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Freelon, concentrating on a program of Stevie Wonder songs from
her current album, sang with exquisite musicality and an unerring
sense of swing. In her capable hands, the Wonder catalog is beginning
to look like a valuable addition to the Great American Songbook.
Closing out the segment, Joe Lovano's seven piece ensemble never
quite managed to get up to speed, failing to effectively re-create
the spirit or the substance of a new album of music associated with
opera singer Enrico Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy's dinner-hour period usually produces the day's most
celebratory moments. Performers unaware of the desire for action in
an audience that has spent four hours sunning, eating and drinking
can be in for a difficult time. But festival producer Darlene Chan,
well aware of the situation, generally schedules acts capable of
stimulating the traditional conga lines, beach-ball volleys and
handkerchief waving.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, it was the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, with
clarinetist Pete Fountain, that kicked off the dinner-hour revelry.
Romping through a set of familiar New Orleans classics (including
"Just a Closer Walk With Thee" and "When the Saints Go Marching In"),
they triggered a gleeful parade of listeners, many carrying colorful
umbrellas and wearing fanciful headgear.</TE>
<TE>   Trumpeter Arturo Sandoval followed, lighting the stage with his
extraordinary versatility--ripping bebop licks on his trumpet,
vigorously playing the timbales and moving to the piano for a brief,
rhapsodic moment. His galvanizing performance was immediately picked
up by the dynamic Cuban band Maraca, whose intoxicating rhythms and
vocals quickly filled the aisles with fans happily indulging their
idiosyncratic interpretations of salsa dancing.</TE>
<TE>   The festival's prime-time segment shifted gears with the arrival
of the Wynton Marsalis septet to the stage. For many jazz fans, this
is the group that represents the best of the influential trumpeter's
many activities. Performing a program resonating with echoes of New
Orleans, Duke Ellington and Mingus--primary Marsalis influences--the
ensemble (with adventurous soloing from Marsalis, saxophonist Wessell
Anderson and--especially--drummer Herlin Riley impressively blurred
the line between entertainment and art.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of Etta James on the bill wasn't surprising; she has
appeared to great acclaim in the past. But placing her in the
headliner position seemed strange, especially since James failed to
include any numbers on her program that offered a particular linkage
to jazz. Still, there was no denying the appeal of her husky,
passionate voice when she wailed the gripping, opening line to her
hit, "At Last," and dug into such classic, blues-drenched tunes as
"I'd Rather Be a Blind Girl" and "Sugar on the Floor."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's Playboy Jazz Festival wrapped with the sounds of the
Marcus Miller ensemble. The eclectic bassist's music--tinged with
references to his association with Miles Davis, enhanced by a
versatility that took him from electric bass to bass clarinet (and a
touching rendering of "Amazing Grace")--provided an appropriate
closing for a day encompassing the length and breadth of jazz's
infinite capacity for creative expression.</TE>

<HD>Call It 'Married ... With Cameras'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of TV habitually reduces matrimony to sitcom laughs or hollow,
soulless rolls of the dice. Note this month's "Looking for Love:
Bachelorettes in Alaska" on Fox, and sleek spouse hunters invading
the ritzy Hamptons on ABC.</LD>
<LD>   But now comes Michael Apted's "Married in America" on A&amp;E,
profiling nine diverse couples in the New York area, Los Angeles and
Birmingham, Ala., and charting their routes to the altar.</LD>
<LD>   It's so good you'll throw rice.</LD>
<TE>   British-bred Apted is not only an accomplished director of feature
films spanning "Gorillas in the Mist," "Coal Miner's Daughter" and
this year's "Enigma." He also makes important documentaries like this
captivating two-parter. It's created in the fashion of his celebrated
"7 Up" films, whose original 14 British school children have been
revisited by his cameras at seven-year intervals since 1963. As a
long-range documentary project--monitoring these twisting lives well
into middle age--this earlier signature work deserves its own
pedestal.</TE>
<TE>   There's something especially poignant about keeping a balance
sheet on the callow youngsters of "7 Up" and watching their innocence
fray, then years later measuring their achievements against the
compromises they've made. "Married in America" has much the same
promise, with Apted planning four additional films about these
couples in this decade. Even if some should split, he'll continue
following the participants as individuals.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't hurt that everyone here is likable, and that you really
want these marriages to flourish.</TE>
<TE>   There are no Rick Rockwells and Darva Congers, sniffing out
America's taste for vulgarity by playing nookie for dollars. Nor
anyone playing the "The Dating Game" with a bang. What strikes you
most, in fact, is the apparent sincerity of these soon-to-marry duos
and how uncowed by the camera they seem while responding to the
unseen Apted's questions in cultured Britspeak.</TE>
<TE>   He asks them pointedly to expose the full panorama of their lives,
from sex to careers to parents. He wants to know their hopes and
aspirations as couples in a fluid era when marriage parameters are
being redrawn in some circles, and the institution itself redefined.
He also asks what problems they envision for themselves and their
mates, and how they plan to resolve them.</TE>
<TE>   Although we'll discover more every two years, it may take the full
decade to learn if these couples symbolize U.S. marriage in the early
21st century. If that is even a realistic goal for the film.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want people to do is connect with it," Apted said in Los
Angeles. "It's so tempting to try to project on it, but I don't want
people to come away with generalizations."</TE>
<TE>   Here's one, though. Helped by producers Steven Lawrence and Dale
Riehl and others, Apted is as good a storyteller here as in the best
of his feature films, benefiting from interesting couples pared from
an original list of more than 100 who submitted video interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Especially striking are the film's intersecting cultures and
religious faiths.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Chris, 25, a white cop with red hair, is marrying
Vanessa, 24, whose mother is a Colombian emigre.</TE>
<TE>   Betty, 26, is white. Her mother is fine with her engagement to her
childhood sweetheart, Reggie, 27. But he says his Haitian American
mom initially "would have rather seen me unhappy with a Haitian woman
than [happy] with anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of marrying the "nice Jewish girl" his parents
anticipated, Neal, a 31-year-old medical student, is engaged to
Cheryl, 33, a second-generation Filipino and Catholic who is
supporting them while he preps for future wealth. Although Neal's
mother now calls Cheryl "a love," her future daughter-in-law sounds
unpersuaded. "Your mom said, 'Don't get too excited, she's not
Jewish,' " she reminds Neal in Apted's presence. "What am I supposed
to say about that?"</TE>
<TE>   What will viewers say about Toni and Kelly, both in their 30s and
living together in a New Jersey suburb, yet destined to speak their
vows in Vermont, the only state recognizing same-sex marriages? Both
are committed to becoming biological mothers through artificial
insemination.</TE>
<TE>   They were an intriguing choice for the film, only because they are
mannishly earthy instead of the feminine, cosmopolitan lesbians that
Apted might have chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to keep away from that elegant, metropolitan gay
circuit," he said, "because this is about ordinary people. I love the
fact that they're from New Jersey."</TE>
<TE>   The "most marginal" of the couples, Apted acknowledges, is Chuck
and Carol, recovering alcoholics and former drug users whose lives
have been oozing craters of misery.</TE>
<TE>   Also the most absorbing.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck, 35, has been married three times. Just two husbands for
Carol, a towering 37-year-old grandmother who wears curved Dragon
Lady nails and stands a head taller than her beefy fiance. They met
years ago as children in the San Fernando Valley and now have scraped
together $5,000 for their biker's nuptials.</TE>
<TE>   Apted said he was determined to include someone "people would
recoil from." That's Chuck, a bruiser who spent four years in prison
for raping a woman he'd earlier slept with, and another term for
failing to register as a sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;E's Web site is getting heat from those opposed to Chuck's
inclusion in "Married in America," Apted said. As he notes, however,
Chuck and Carol are both articulate, acknowledge their mistakes and
appear earnest about marriage giving them a new start.</TE>
<TE>   The camera captures their vows. The groom is emotional. And
there's something dignified and regal about the bride, even as her
tattoos show through the netting of her long white dress. Then off
they go on the Harley, her wedding train flowing behind them like a
streamer.</TE>
<TE>   You can't help thinking they're riding uphill. Chuck says he's
"never been faithful" as a husband. Is it too late to change? In
fact, how will all these couples cope with the challenges they surely
will face?</TE>
<TE>   In two years, we'll talk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Marriage in America" can be seen at 9 tonight on A&amp;E. The network
has rated it TV-G (suitable for all ages).</TE>

<HD>Laugh and Cry With 'Ram Dass'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a career spanning 35 years, filmmaker Mickey Lemle has seen many
of his documentaries broadcast on television. In India alone, he
recalls, an astounding 400 million viewers tuned in to watch his film
about U.S. astronauts called "The Other Side of the Moon." In Russia,
200 million tuned in.</LD>
<LD>   But Lemle said his latest feature-length documentary, "Ram Dass:
Fierce Grace," which begins a one-week run Friday at the Nuart in
West Los Angeles, is an experience that can't be replicated on the
small screen.</LD>
<LD>   "The humor [on the screen] becomes much more infectious in a
theater," Lemle observed. "The poignant moments become much more
poignant." You can't duplicate "the experience of people laughing and
crying in large groups," he added.</LD>
<TE>   Ram Dass, who was born Richard Alpert, gained a worldwide
following after the publication of his 1971 bestseller "Be Here Now."
It was Alpert who, in the 1960s, gained fame when he and fellow
Harvard professor Timothy Leary conducted early experiments with
psychedelics and were subsequently fired by the university. He later
traveled to India, where he met a guru affectionately known as
Maharaji Ji, who gave him the name Ram Dass, which means servant of
God.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Ram Dass, who now lives in Marin County, suffered
a crippling stroke. Lemle, who has known him for 25 years, began
filming his documentary in the months that followed, eventually
spending more than two years with his friend.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the film deals with how he deals with the effects of his
stroke and how he has been using it all these years to get personal
spiritual development," Lemle said. "People come up to me after
screenings crying and thanking me for the movie and for the
experience and giving them a perspective on their own suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people all over the world who love him dearly," Lemle
added. "His book, 'Be Here Now,' is still in print. For millions of
people, he has opened them up to a sense of their own inner life and
their spirituality."</TE>

<HD>MSNBC Defends Move to More Talk</HD>
<DH>Television* Executives say shift from straight news to
opinion format will meet public's demand for analysis. An expanded ad
campaign also is planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was the day of the ceremony officially ending recovery efforts at
New York's World Trade Center site, and Jerry Nachman, MSNBC's newest
commentator as well as its new editor-in-chief, was on the scene.</LD>
<LD>   As on the other cable news channels, CNN and Fox News, MSNBC had
moving coverage of the solemn event, and numerous interviews with
officials. Then there were Nachman's  guests, such as celebrity
saloon-keeper Elaine Kaufman and New York Post gossip columnist Cindy
Adams.</LD>
<LD>   The latter told her sad story of Sept. 11, when she had to cancel
a party, putting to naught advance preparations including a caterer,
flowers and "a gardener doing the terrace."</LD>
<TE>   Some NBC News executives watching from offices uptown cringed.</TE>
<TE>   As opinion-driven Fox has surged into first place in the ratings
race among cable news channels, and more straight-laced CNN has hired
well-known on-air talent such as Connie Chung, MSNBC executives have
been pleading for money from their corporate bosses, NBC and
Microsoft, to make the station more than an embarrassing,
money-losing also-ran.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, the money finally came through. But the aggressive
changes that have been unveiled in the last several weeks,
transforming the network from straight news to high-energy opinion
that some think doesn't befit the NBC News reputation, have left many
in the industry scratching their heads.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC's most serious newscast, "The News With Brian Williams,"
anchored by the man who has been named Tom Brokaw's eventual "NBC
Nightly News" successor, will leave the channel, where it has been a
drag on ratings. It's headed to NBC-owned CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours of daytime news will be replaced by two two-hour blocks
of opinion, one from New York radio hosts Ron Kuby, a liberal, and
Curtis Sliwa, a conservative; the other from former California
Democratic party leader Bill Press, recently let go from CNN's
combative "Crossfire," and former Republican presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan, also formerly of "Crossfire." Both shows will include
news updates.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening, liberal Phil Donahue is returning to television
and Chris Matthews' "Hardball," which has diverse opinions presented
in a loud format, is getting a prime slot, two moves that have gotten
good reviews. Nachman, former editor of the New York Post, will have
an hour that will look at stories behind the day's news.</TE>
<TE>   Former presidential candidate Alan Keyes, who got a show just last
January, declined to move to MSNBC's daytime lineup and will be off
after July 15, the day most changes take effect.</TE>
<TE>   Until earlier in the year, MSNBC hadn't decided "whether they
wanted to be like CNN or like Fox," said Andrew Tyndall, a news
programming analyst. "They were falling between two stools." Now, he
said, NBC "has made CNBC the high-grade channel and they've made
MSNBC the talk-radio channel."</TE>
<TE>   The format has many inside NBC and out wondering what has happened
to the vaunted synergy that was supposed to exist with NBC News,
allowing it to get stories on the air when the main NBC network was
running entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   But NBC News President Neal Shapiro said he's "very comfortable"
with the changes. "I understand why some people are upset," he said,
but added that they haven't seen how the moves will be executed. "We
are going to be the most aggressive, hard-charging news operation on
cable," he said, and some days the commentators won't get on the air
because there is so much news.</TE>
<TE>   "But as we all know," Shapiro added, "in the news cycle there are
hours when nothing's happening. Rather than stretching reporters to
say the same things over and over and over again--another criticism
of cable news--why not inject a little more analysis and opinion? But
until people actually see it, they fear it's going to be nothing but
a screaming fest."</TE>
<TE>   "We're a newspaper in the morning and a weekly newsmagazine in the
evening," Erik Sorenson, MSNBC's president, said of the new format.
"We're such a news-rich culture and society right now; what consumers
are demanding is analysis. They want to know, 'What does it mean?' "</TE>
<TE>   He said the criticism that his new analysts are just loudmouths is
"wrongheaded. These are all exceptionally smart, well-informed people
capable of exploring the depth behind the headlines. These are the
best and the brightest."</TE>
<TE>   As for sniping that the network was veering too far off the news,
as evidenced by Nachman's interviews at ground zero, Sorenson called
them "tremendous guests, quintessential New Yorkers."</TE>
<TE>   Tyndall called the new format derivative of Fox, but said MSNBC's
inclusion of "genuine left-wingers" Kuby and Donahue--a rarity in the
TV landscape--could be a smart move in trying to lure an audience.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as important as the format changes is a new ad campaign.
After spending less than an estimated $1 million on advertising and
promotion in the past two years, the channel will soon embark on a
campaign that insiders peg at about $5 million, plus more than that
in promotions for "Donahue" on NBC's owned stations and the NBC
network.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, at a board meeting last week, Sorenson said, there were
assurances that MSNBC will get support in promoting the channel from
Microsoft's powerful Internet portal MSN.com, which it has never had
before. CNN has benefited from a similar relationship with its sister
operation AOL.</TE>
<TE>   That commitment to ramp up synergy from the two partners comes
even as the MSNBC name--which promotes the companion Web site--is
often disappearing from the MSNBC screen. Instead, the little
identifying "bug" in the lower right corner says "America's News
Channel," which is also the network's latest branding strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders have said for months that the change signaled a possible
desire to unwind the complicated Microsoft-NBC partnership, while NBC
executives have insisted that it was only to lessen viewer confusion
among all the various NBC-tagged channels on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenson denied any move to break up the joint venture. "It's
winding tighter. MSNBC.com and the Microsoft partnership are still
incredibly important to us.... [The name] MSNBC is not going
anywhere; it's critically important to the interactive piece."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are fears and whispers among MSNBC employees that if
these changes don't work, NBC will give up on all-news and try to
convert the channel into a home for reruns of NBC entertainment
shows. Sorenson said he is unaware of any such thinking at the
company and that it will never come to that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the pressure's on: We've gotta do better, we will do
better, we oughta do better. I think we didn't have the best
resources to deal with the post-Sept. 11 world and now we do," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes will mean "gradual and visible success," he added,
predicting that MSNBC, which in May averaged 232,000 viewers per
24-hour period, will overtake second-place CNN, which averaged twice
as many viewers. (Fox was on top with an average of 594,000 viewers
per 24-hour period).</TE>
<TE>   "CNN is takeable; they are extremely vulnerable despite their
longevity and brand," Sorenson said. "The rest of the folks at NBC
feel that way too and we're going to do it."</TE>

<HD>Worlds-Apart Artists Explore Universal Themes</HD>

<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drawing from an eclectic well on Friday, the annual COLA (City of Los
Angeles) performance series began its final weekend on two stages in
the Los Angeles Theatre Center with mostly new works by modern dance
choreographer Victoria Marks and classical Cambodian
dancer-choreographer Sophiline Cheam Shapiro. For their stylistic
differences, however, the worlds-apart artists offered up a handful
of universal themes: love, mortality, grief, passion.</LD>
<LD>   According to press notes, Marks' premiere, "Against Ending,"
although informed by the events of Sept. 11, is more a rant against
endings for which one is unprepared. In a barrage of in-your-face
moves danced heroically by Maria Gillespie, Stephanie Nugent and
Karen Schupp, the notion of being clobbered by the unfathomable let
loose a host of emotions as the trio took on guises of airplanes
(widespread fluttering arms), buildings (swaying, crumbling), and
people (crawling, rueful head-shaking) from that horrific day.</LD>
<LD>   Set to Amy Denio's hauntingly aggressive score, the 22-minute
opus, masterfully lighted by Carol McDowell, saw the dancers
sporadically interrupted by a series of short blackouts. The music,
too, built up before stopping suddenly as the performers assumed
runners' stances or gesticulated upward. Relentlessly kinetic, this
powerful piece concluded with a glaringly lighted, empty stage.</LD>
<TE>   Marks' "July Gone" (2000), a witty treatise on dance-making,
featured the London-based Bedlam Dance Company--Marie Fitzpatrick,
Yael Flexer, Fiona Millward and Maria Ryan. Displaying rubbery bodies
while spouting narrative on why they continue to dance, this quartet,
a kind of terpsichorean Marx Brothers, ended with a barefoot unison
shuffle.</TE>
<TE>   While Marks made use of epic tragedy, Shapiro personalized death
in her premiere, "The Glass Box," a new solo based on the
assassination of a Cambodian friend who had an affair with that
country's prime minister. Initially performed on a platform and
enhanced by shadows cast by the dancer, Shapiro, dripping in the
traditional elegance of a sparkling gold costume and headdress, made
every move a study in beauty and depth.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by six stellar musicians on Cambodian instruments, the
15-minute work flowed from the hypnotically slow with sinewy hand
gestures weaving wondrous patterns in the air, to an accelerated,
tiny-stepping motif. Shapiro, cloaked in an air of other-worldliness,
maintained a sense of resignation to her fate.</TE>
<TE>   Also infused by fate: the six-minute piece "The Honeymoon," a
scene from Shapiro's concert-length classical dance drama adapted
from Shakespeare's "Othello." Shapiro's Desdemona (here called
Khanitha Devi), partnered by Charya Burt's Othello (Samritechak, or
"dark prince"), both clad in Cambodian dress, created a lovely
tableau, underneath which lay deceit, jealousy and murder.</TE>
<TE>   The work, which premiered in 2000 in Phnom Penh, was intended as a
cultural bridge between two worlds--a classical Western story couched
in classical Cambodian dance. Shapiro's take--in which Othello
ultimately pleads for punishment instead of forgiveness--is a
metaphor for the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot's genocidal 1975-1979 reign.</TE>
<TE>   "Tep Monorom (Heavenly Bliss)," a traditional number performed by
Shapiro, Burt, Tina Toun and Julie Nuth saw the quartet seemingly
float across the stage in a work demonstrating that the heavens are
in harmony.</TE>

<HD>'Scooby-Doo' Fetches Biggest June Debut</HD>
<DH>Box Office* With an estimated $56.4 million, it also boasts
the third-best start of '02, thanks partly to adult ticket buyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The feature film version of the '70s TV animation series "Scooby-Doo"
didn't bowl over critics, but it did pluck the strings of nostalgia
for a generation and its children, soaring to a sensational
$56.4-million estimate in 3,447 theaters in its first three days.
That's the biggest June debut ever and the best opening weekend of
the year save for "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" and
"Spider-Man."</LD>
<LD>   "Scooby" and pals doubled the receipts of the weekend's other
strong arrival, "The Bourne Identity," starring Matt Damon, which
grabbed a hefty $27.5 million in 2,638 cinemas. "Bourne" in turn was
almost twice as big as John Woo's war epic "Windtalkers," which
washed up in third place with a moderate $14.5-million estimate in
2,898 movie houses.</LD>
<LD>   As has been the pattern on most weekends in 2002, especially since
the May 3 debut of "Spider-Man," attendance sprinted ahead of the
comparable period last year. According to Exhibitor Relations, on the
basis of studio estimates the top 12 movies are expected to gross
about $160 million, almost 25% better than the second weekend of June
2001. Discounting that surge for ticket-price inflation, admissions
were ahead by a healthy 20%.</LD>
<TE>   And the best weeks of the season are still ahead, as summer recess
breaks out over the coming week, and daily attendance potential rises
through to mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   Supplanting "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" (as well as the
longer-running "Spider-Man" and the latest "Star Wars" episode) with
the family audience, the mostly live-action "Scooby" got a one-week
jump on the latest Disney animated effort, "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   What Warner Bros. distribution head Dan Fellman was not counting
on in projections was that "Scooby" would attract so many flying-solo
adults. "We had audiences from 8 to 80," he says. Adults kicked the
film into overdrive, enabling it to surpass the previous June record
holder, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," which grossed $52.8
million in 1998. With schools mostly out, Fellman is looking for
bullish midweek numbers that could be enough to carry "Scooby" past
$100 million by the end of its second full week.</TE>
<TE>   "Bourne" and "Windtalkers" split an over-25, largely male
audience, which had been flocking to "Sum of All Fears." Of the two
new arrivals, "Bourne" did far better, bolstered by the popularity of
Robert Ludlum's bestselling novel. It also managed to attract a
sizable under-25 audience thanks to what Universal distribution head
Nikki Rocco calls "a fresh, hip marketing campaign that didn't make
it seem like your father's spy movie."</TE>
<TE>   "Windtalkers," starring Nicolas Cage, is another disappointment
for MGM, relative to its $100-million-plus price tag. Like last
weekend's "Bad Company," and before that, "Collateral Damage" and
"Big Trouble," the World War II epic suffered from schedule shifting
in the wake of last year's Sept. 11 attacks. "Windtalkers' "
potential was further compromised by the fact that it followed two
other successful war tales, "Black Hawk Down" and "We Were Soldiers."
As for "Bad Company," second weekend numbers sagged to a wan $6.1
million in 2,944 theaters for a bland 10-day total of $21.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   In fourth place was "Sum of All Fears," which was the No. 1 movie
for the last two weeks. Even with two competitors courting the older
male audience, "Sum" managed to hang in there with only a 30% drop,
adding an estimated $13.5 million over the weekend in 3,230 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Though the female audience flocked to "The Divine Secrets of the
Ya-Ya Sisterhood" last weekend and boosted it to first place during
the week, the mother-daughter Southern gothic tale dropped almost 40%
in its second weekend in 2,507 theaters to an estimated $9.8 million.
Considering that "Ya-Ya" is surviving almost solely on female
admissions, the almost $35 million collected in 10 days attests to
the box-office clout of women.</TE>
<TE>   It looks as if "Attack of the Clones" will join the elite
$300-million club before it's through, based on the $9.2-million
estimate in its fifth weekend in 2,401 theaters. Though it has
grossed more than $270 million to date, "Clones" is not in the same
league as its predecessor, "Phantom Menace." Nor will it be able to
claim the year's No. 1 position, which now belongs to "Spider-Man."
In its seventh weekend, "Spidey" was still swinging with an estimated
$7.4 million in 2,702 theaters and an astounding $382 million to
date. The animated "Spirit" was bruised by the arrival of
"Scooby-Doo," but not disastrously so. Fourth weekend was down about
40% to an estimated $5.5 million in 2,873 theaters and a
more-than-satisfactory monthlong total of almost $64 million. At this
gait, "Spirit" doesn't appear likely to reach $100 million. In 10th
place is the blaxploitation spoof "Undercover Brother," which grossed
about $4.6 million in its third weekend in 1,830 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   In what continues to be the major independent surprise hit of the
year, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which is still on only 455 screens,
took in an additional $1.8 million in its ninth weekend of release,
lifting its total to $13.7 million.</TE>

<LD>As the production whiz team the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams and Chad
Hugo lent their signature style to hits by acts as diverse as No
Doubt, Mystikal and Britney Spears. On Saturday at the House of
Blues, some of the pair's friends helped their own group, N.E.R.D.,
step credibly into the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   N.E.R.D. (which stands for No One Ever Really Dies) also comprised
the duo's rapper pal Shay and Minneapolis band Spy Mob, which played
its own fine set of melodic soul-pop before adeptly assuming backup
duty. The philosophy behind the acronym--that people's energies never
disappear but only change form--somewhat governed the group's crunchy
amalgamation of hip-hop, funk, rock and R&amp;B, at times recalling the
vibe of Run-DMC.</LD>
<LD>   The sold-out 80-minute show featured such standouts from
N.E.R.D.'s debut album, "In Search of ... ," as the propulsively
funky, mock-macho "Things Are Getting Better" and the head-banging
anthem "Rock Star," along with a turn at Busta Rhymes' single "Pass
the Courvoisier Part II," on which Williams appears. The set was far
more dynamic than your average hip-hop concert, making it easy to
forgive the lack of strong vocals and the pedestrian lyrical
tendencies.</LD>
<TE>   Occasionally the music felt repetitive, but the main pitfall was a
lengthy guest turn by singer Kelis, another Neptunes beneficiary. She
injected lively, Tina Turner-esque soulfulness into N.E.R.D.'s steamy
"Truth or Dare," but soon wore out her welcome with her own material.</TE>

<HD>A Future-Shock Sideshow of Technology and Fantasy</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>P.T. Barnum and advanced computer technology occupy very different
parts of the popular imagination. But at Art Center College of
Design's Williamson Gallery, they come together in a boisterous
exhibition of prints, sculptures and videos by 24 artists who use
up-to-the-minute software. Combining the sleazy appeal of a sideshow
with the futuristic look of digital imagery, "Situated Realities:
Where Technology and Imagination Intersect" is a virtual circus, a
shamelessly entertaining spectacle that says a lot about the
media-saturated world in which we live--like it or not.</LD>
<LD>   Organized by Will Larson for the Maryland Institute College of
Art, the accessible show is entirely composed of representational
images. Most are both phenomenally realistic and utterly
unbelievable--like the special effects in Hollywood movies aimed at
the male teen market. All are crafted to the highest standards. And
many are huge, measuring up to 4 by 8 feet.</LD>
<LD>   Among the most eye-grabbing is a pair of C-prints by Charles
White. In one, a bare-chested man displays the decapitated head of a
reptilian beast. A shirtless boy, his skin glistening with sweat,
pokes at the freshly killed trophy with a long stick, revealing fangs
that put Dracula to shame.</LD>
<TE>   The second print depicts a young couple in bed, fighting off the
advances of a creature that resembles a cross between a scrawny troll
and a hairy alien. Sinking its teeth into the man as it tugs at the
woman's T-shirt, the fiendish intruder gives comic form to the fears
and fantasies of adolescent sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Less action-packed but more creepy is Anthony Goicolea's "Class
Picture," a group portrait of a dozen blond schoolboys who not only
wear the same uniforms, haircuts and expressions, but have identical
bodies and facial features. In another computer-generated image, a
group of nine contented clones hauls buckets of snow through the
woods. In neither picture do Goicolea's people act as if anything out
of the ordinary is going on.</TE>
<TE>   Mind-blowing weirdness is also a matter of dull routine in Margi
Geerlinks' pair of color prints. The first shows a disaffected woman
knitting a child-size body suit out of yarn, which gradually
transforms itself into human flesh. The second portrays a gray-haired
man laboring away on a sewing machine, from which spills the body of
a lithe nude. Both clinically surreal images bypass the messy
humanity of Dr. Frankenstein's creation for the antiseptic perfection
of Pygmalion's maiden.</TE>
<TE>   Mutant fusions take place in the works of several other artists.
Daniel Lee's four sepia-toned Lambda prints portray the futuristic
offspring of people and beasts, including a pig, a lion, a snake and
an owl. The collaborative team known as Aziz + Cucher has printed
large images of machine parts made of flesh, which resemble props
from a David Cronenberg film. And Simen Johan's four silver prints
meld found and manipulated images to link childhood and sexuality.
Harking back to Lewis Carroll's photographs of lovely little Lolitas,
Johan's budding vixens radiate innocence alongside more troubling
sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Crewdson and Craig Kalpakjian lavish similar attention on
exteriors and interiors. No people appear in their images, which have
the presence of stage sets for dramas awaiting viewer participation.</TE>
<TE>   Crewdson loads his scenes with juicy details that suggest an
absurd world gone wrong. In one, hundreds of slices of Wonder Bread
form neat columns on an undeveloped slice of suburban property as
turkeys, pheasants, ducks and woodcock look on. In another, a dead
fox lies beneath a canopy of half-eaten grapes.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Crewdson's Baroque clutter, Kalpakjian is a Minimalist.
His image of a gently curved hall captures the go-nowhere inertia of
modern bureaucracies. A looped videotape follows the endless
corridor, taking viewers in circles.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Weiss, Anna Ullrich and Martina Lopez also fabricate
fantastic landscapes. Juxtaposing images found in family scrapbooks
and magazine advertisements, they use computers in the same way that
early 20th-century artists used scissors and glue to make collages,
cutting and pasting bits and pieces to form illogical dreamscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Yasumasa Morimura, Dieter Huber and Kathy Grove limit themselves
to art history. Morimura inserts himself into imitation masterpieces.
Huber makes big color prints of imaginary plants that mimic the
format of Karl Blossfeldt's black-and-white photographs. And Grove
sets up studio shots of famous works by Brassai, Muybridge and Lange,
whose compositions she alters.</TE>
<TE>   While the works by these three artists aspire to please insiders
with their studious cleverness, those by Alexander Heilner, Robert
Lazzarini and Euan MacDonald prefer gags that don't assume viewers
are art historians in training. Heilner's graphic designs are less
engaging than the advertising campaign for a popular brand of vodka,
in which various artists' trademark works fill the silhouette of a
bottle. Lazzarini's super-realistic sculptures of a skull, a phone
and a pair of hammers--all distorted as if seen at extremely oblique
angles--grab your attention but fail to do anything with it. Last
year's attacks on the World Trade Center overshadow MacDonald's
videotape of two jets flying side by side, even though he made it in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The least captivating works are the most abstract. Andreas
Muller-Pohle's eight Iris prints present thousands of overlapping
numbers, letters and symbols. A wall-label states that it's a
digitally coded representation of the first known photograph, but you
have to take that on faith.</TE>
<TE>   Natalia Blanch's five metal sculptures, on which lines and ridges
are etched, resemble gigantic petrified microchips. If not for the
wall-label, you'd never know that her mute works are visual
translations of her readings of spiritual texts, whose titles she
doesn't disclose. Likewise, Jim Campbell's ghostly LED portrait
sometimes flickers and at other times stands still. The alteration
occurs when it shifts between digital and analog processes. This
makes sense when you learn that it depicts Harry Nyquist, a
mathematician who developed an equation about the relationship
between digital and analog information.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining works resemble maps. Mark Campbell changes the paths
of urban rivers by collaging aerial photographs. Collaborators Bill
Outcault and Lilla Locurto transcribe the contours of their bodies to
two dimensions, subjecting their distorted portraits to the same
changes that take place when globes become maps.</TE>
<TE>   Like Muller-Pohle, Blanch and Jim Campbell, they embrace a
formulaic sort of formalism, one that treats new technologies as
filters through which the same old information is passed. In
contrast, the most ambitious works in the exhibition throw their lot
in with the tawdry amusements of popular culture, leaving viewers
free to interact on their own terms.</TE>

<HD>McCaleb Finds Rhythm in Repetition</HD>

<LD>You have to be wary of interpreting a dance whose title tells you
twice that things may not be what they seem. Even describing Nancy
McCaleb's new "The Impersonation of Mr. Peacock (Part 1: The Liar),"
a collaboration with her company and with Belgian artist Francis
Alys, has its pitfalls.</LD>
<LD>   Seen Friday at Sherwood Auditorium at the Museum of Contemporary
Art, San Diego, in La Jolla, the piece appears to revisit a single
event again and again, each time expanding on it or putting it in a
larger or different context.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Geiger walks into a group of starkly lighted dancers (Aly
Fischer, Sarah Fanoe-Kaye, Greg Lane, Elizabeth Licea and Elizabeth
Swallow) sitting tensely on chairs, looking toward the forward left
corner of the stage. He rights a fallen chair, sits with them.
There's a sudden blackout, the sound of thunder, and when the lights
come on, everyone has fallen onto the floor.</LD>
<TE>   In the ensuing repetitions, we see that they do not so much fall
as explode out of the chairs. Over the course of the 30-minute work,
this explosive event will recur in solos and various groupings and
contexts, as well as in Eloisa Haudenschild's film images of the
dancers projected behind them.</TE>
<TE>   The dancers will also deliver silent speeches to unseen auditors.
They will observe each other, sometimes as objects of laughter.
Vignettes suggesting relationships will emerge. Haudenschild's film
images will incorporate office and apartment buildings, a reminder of
Sept. 11? Christopher Zurfluh's neo-Baroque, Minimalist music will
add poignant emotional color.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, as if completing the event with which the dance began,
Geiger will walk off stage, leaving everyone behind in the same
position they were in at the opening of the dance.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the work remained mystifying, impersonal and at times
vague in directing a viewer's focus. But the finely honed dancers
were compelling to watch.</TE>
<TE>   The program opened with McCaleb's "Verdigris," commissioned by the
museum and premiered last year. Early press material announced that
it would be "danced in memory of company member, Ricardo Peralta,"
who died suddenly last year in Honolulu at age 39. This note did not
appear in the final program booklet, but the central focus, isolation
and involvement of a single dancer (Geiger) with the others evoked
that kind of tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Haudenschild's dark-toned video images of leaves and trees, moving
in different directions, provided a larger context for the events.
When the images turned solarized toward the end, they reinforced a
sense of shift of the dancers into another dimension.</TE>

<DH>KROQ's Weenie Roast is a refreshing dose of rock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hey, modern rock fans: Ready to hum, perhaps even tap your foot
again? If the annual KROQ (106.7 FM) Weenie Roast can be trusted as a
forecast of what's headed our way on the modern rock scene, the 10th
edition Saturday at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine suggested
that the angst-laden clouds of the recent past will break enough to
allow some sun, refreshing breezes and with them some genuine fun.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did New York's red-hot export the Strokes and Australia's
Vines turn in sparkling sets that reaffirmed the vitality of
guitar-driven melodic rock, but the capacity crowd's enthusiastic
receptions for both also proved that they stand a chance in a
marketplace more tilted toward heavy rap-rock and punk-metal acts.</LD>
<LD>   Even the normally catchy pop-punk of Jimmy Eat World paled
following the Strokes' performance, a case study in first-rate song
craft and no-frills delivery by Julian Casablancas, the baby-faced
singer with the laconic, Lou Reed vocal style, and his four cohorts.</LD>
<TE>   The Weenie Roast also included a winning, unbilled set by the
venerable Violent Femmes that further lightened the atmosphere,
thanks to the trio's wry, skillfully sculpted alt-rock.</TE>
<TE>   Once the sun went down, so did the vibe, as spunkier afternoon
sets from pop-punk group New Found Glory, Jack Johnson and others
gave way to the grinding, testosterone-rich likes of Papa Roach,
Puddle of Mudd, Rob Zombie, Incubus, P.O.D. and, with a knockout
finale, System of a Down.</TE>
<TE>   The message? The musical storm clouds may be starting to break,
but they won't go softly, nor quietly, into that good night.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when the sturm und drang is as gripping as System of a
Down's, there's no reason to look for brighter skies.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. quartet, perhaps the most sociopolitical band to go
mainstream since Rage Against the Machine, taps elements of
predecessors in a variety of genres, from punk and metal to hip-hop
and even surf music, but in totality System is utterly unique. The
performance by singer Serj Tankian and company was so intense you
were tempted to check the stage rigging for signs of buckling metal.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the late-evening barrage, techno-rocker Moby offered a
welcome change of pace. Unfortunately, his brief set ran into
technical difficulties, and while he regrouped to close with the
driving "Body Rock," by that point it was anticlimactic.</TE>
<TE>   Incubus and Papa Roach, while eagerly received by the crowd,
delivered plenty of aggro-rock firepower, but little that was
musically or lyrically memorable.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of the dark side of the bill before System of a Down
arrived was old-school horror-rocker Rob Zombie, who brought with him
a much-needed sense of theatricality and humor. He's also a top-notch
showman who skipped and skittered hither and yon around the stage
like a Muhammad Ali of heavy rock.</TE>
<TE>   Of the day's punk component, ever-reliable Bad Religion provided
the philosophical heft and the sheer force such far younger and
comparatively lightweight punks Unwritten Law and New Found Glory
have yet to tap.</TE>
<TE>   For a time it seemed as though the Femmes' name would be as close
as this year's roast came to any type of female representation on
stage. Moby single-handedly provided the feminine touch with five
women among his nine-member ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, they were merely five among about 70 musicians who played
through the 10-hour show. The Weenie Roast, whose proceeds benefit
three local charities, has built some fine traditions over the last
decade, but giving women equal time isn't one of them.</TE>

<HD>Where Exactly Have All the Great Male Jazz Singers Gone?</HD>
<DH>Music* While female singers are enjoying a renaissance,
their male counterparts are mostly silent. What will it take to bring
them back?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD REICH</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They once were the epitome of hip: tuxedoed men with nary a hair out
of place, swinging exuberantly in front a roaring big band or a sleek
little combo, coolly snapping their fingers all the while.</LD>
<LD>   They commanded huge fees playing showrooms across the country, the
mere mention of their names--Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Mel Torme,
Louis Armstrong--assuring turn-away business.</LD>
<LD>   Yet today they are an endangered species at best, an anachronism
at worst.</LD>
<TE>   The once-glamorized male jazz singer practically has vanished from
America's cultural radar. Worse, the men are AWOL at the very moment
that their female counterparts, as well as jazz instrumentalists of
both sexes, are enjoying resurgent popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Scan the Billboard jazz charts virtually any week, and you'll see
the same names hovering at or near the top: Diana Krall, Norah Jones,
Jane Monheit, Cassandra Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Then look for the men: There's hardly anyone there. Occasionally,
Harry Connick Jr., whose movie career always has bolstered his
singing, turns up. More recently, there's Steve Tyrell, a record
exec-turned-crooner whose bleatings hardly can be considered jazz.</TE>
<TE>   The real jazz singers, such as Mark Murphy, Jon Hendricks, Kurt
Elling and Bobby McFerrin, simply don't move enough recordings to
earn a long-standing berth on the charts. (McFerrin's old hit "Don't
Worry, Be Happy," by the way, fits no one's definition of jazz.)</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the male vocalists fully realize that they've been
overshadowed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has to do with the fact that men run the bands, the
clubs, the record companies--everything--and they generally prefer to
see a skirt," says Murphy, at 70 a veteran of lost record deals and
long stretches of underemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "And then there's the songs--you know, the 'moon, June, spoon'
soupy kinds of songs that a lot of people expect to hear. Those
aren't easy for a man to sing. They're really written for women."</TE>
<TE>   Yet both the romantic nature of non-rock songwriting and the male
domination of the music business hardly are recent phenomena. In
fact, it was much the same, if not worse, during the era of Sinatra,
Cole and Torme. So why should the male jazz singer become persona non
grata?</TE>
<TE>   The real answer, many believe, goes back to the great cultural
quakes of the 1960s, which forced jazz musicians of all kinds--but
male vocalists, in particular--to the margins of America's cultural
life.</TE>
<TE>   "When rock 'n' roll came in, the sound of Frank Sinatra and the
sound of swinging suddenly became music that your parents listened
to," Elling says.</TE>
<TE>   Even among those who still were listening to grown-up swing music
when youth-oriented rock ascended, "they pretty much only wanted to
hear Frank and Ella [Fitzgerald] and that level of artistry and
magnitude," Elling says. "It was almost like there were these huge,
huge trees that were absorbing all the sun, and there wasn't a lot of
new growth."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Sinatra and Fitzgerald had learned their art in the same
grueling way as jazz singers before them: by singing a relentless
series of one-nighters with the big bands (Sinatra with the Harry
James and Tommy Dorsey bands, Fitzgerald with the Chick Webb and
Dizzy Gillespie ensembles). The demise of the great touring swing
bands meant that the next generation of talent had nowhere to go to
learn the ephemeral, technically demanding art of jazz singing.</TE>
<TE>   "With on-the-road schooling [of the big bands] virtually at an end
by the 1950s, the lack of any other training arena in the 1960s and
1970s affected jazz singing, and all but the most tenacious fell by
the wayside," write Bruce Crowther and Mike Pinfold in "Singing
Jazz."</TE>
<TE>   This "hiatus of almost an entire generation," as the authors put
it, abruptly interrupted the development of male jazz singing at the
very moment it had reached its pinnacle, with Sinatra's Capitol
recordings of the 1950s and Reprise discs of the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "The men who might have become great jazz vocalists had almost no
choice--they went into rhythm and blues instead," says Chicago jazz
singer Brienn Perry.</TE>
<TE>   The same could be said of women, but when the jazz industry
finally reawakened in the mid-1980s, thanks partly to the protean
gifts of trumpeter and jazz advocate Wynton Marsalis, the industry
reflexively turned to women as leading vocalists, returning to the
well-worn archetype of women as singers or "canaries," as they were
once called.</TE>
<TE>   When Cassandra Wilson's "Blue Skies" CD emerged as the
biggest-selling jazz record of 1988, the record labels practically
tripped over each other trying to sign women vocalists. Although
Vanessa Rubin, Nnenna Freelon, Madeline Eastman, Karrin Allyson,
Roseanna Vitro and scores more did not approach Wilson's level of
talent, their visibility meant that women came to dominate jazz
singing in the late 1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the mid-'90s that Elling--at the time a somewhat
rough but technically brilliant Chicago jazz singer--began to reclaim
a place for young men in front of the microphone. His artistically
stunning debut on Blue Note, "Close Your Eyes" (1995), proved that a
male jazz singer under 30 could make a valuable, innovative musical
statement on a major record label.</TE>
<TE>   But even for Elling, the going has been tough. Although he has
been showered with critical praise and industry accolades (including
several Grammy nominations and a spot on the prestigious Down Beat
Critics Poll), Elling's CDs have not been flying out of record
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Krall's enormous crossover success--she sold more than 1
million copies each of her past two recordings, "When I Look in Your
Eyes" (1999) and "The Look of Love" (2001)--the record labels
recently redoubled their efforts on behalf of performers such as
24-year-old Jane Monheit, who sold more than 100,000 copies of her
debut CD, "Never Never Land" (2000), and twice as many of her newest
release, "Come Dream With Me" (2001). Similarly, neophyte Norah Jones
unloaded more than 300,000 copies of her recent debut CD, "Come Away
With Me."</TE>
<TE>   "I used to get a little bit upset about it," Elling, 34, concedes
of the difference between male and female sales. "But now I think of
it more as an interesting challenge, rather than any kind of
depressing fact.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a deal breaker. It's just a habit.... Who wouldn't want
to listen to a beautiful young lady sing? The people who listen to
swinging music just have a habit of listening to women but don't have
that habit with men, and they haven't had that habit for a while."</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether listeners ever will reacquire it. Murphy
insists that "things are heating up again," citing not only his own
busy performance schedule, but the emergence of a new generation of
male jazz singers, such as Elling, Curtis Stigers and the British Ian
Shaw. These young artists may have made scant impression on the
marketplace, Murphy says, but at least they signal that the flow of
talent has been rejuvenated.</TE>

<HD>A King-Size Challenge in Experimental 'Lear'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the most controversial moments of Robert Wilson's unforgettable
"Exploring 'King Lear' " for UCLA Extension in 1985, his actors had
to contend with an overlay of "King Lear" films and recordings dating
back to the beginning of the century--all of them coming at once in a
startling reminder of how our perceptions of classic theater are
colored and sometimes deadened by every previous staging.</LD>
<LD>   Experimental productions can shake us loose from our
connoisseurship, demanding that we experience a classic as an
unpredictable and even dangerous creation, and this is exactly the
value of director Travis Preston's audacious and intermittently
revelatory modern-dress "King Lear" for the newly formed professional
Center for New Theater at CalArts.</LD>
<LD>   At the official opening on Friday, many of Preston's innovations
seemed willful, confusing and even ruinous, but just as many made you
look at the play in a new light, from a different angle and with no
shield between you and its uncompromising vision of human brutality.
"King Lear" is never easy, but with its all-female cast, large-scale
video projections and insistence that the audience follow the action
from room to room, this version delivers one artful surprise after
another.</LD>
<TE>   It is performed in the imposing, 99-year-old Edison Electric
Building at the Brewery Arts Complex near downtown L.A. Preston and
set designer Christopher Barreca use its spatial possibilities
resourcefully, emphasizing front-to-back action in the scene in which
Lear divides his kingdom and then, after the audience and cast move
to daughter Goneril's domain, wide (lateral) action washed with
oceanic video images designed by Christopher Kondek.</TE>
<TE>   Circular paths dominate the most daring sequence--one in which the
audience sits on risers looking at the play through a massive picture
frame attached to the first row of seats. The actors come close to
the frame, speaking directly to us, and suddenly the whole riser-unit
swivels to follow them, rotating like a camera dolly to isolate
certain characters. It's "King Lear" reconceived as a living movie or
hallucinatory theme-park ride, and it's thrilling.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously the production's major shifts of scale impose unorthodox
challenges on the cast, and many of the leads can't stay in character
when switching gears from intimate to declamatory acting. Nor does it
help that Preston usually keeps them miles apart or facing away from
one another in scenes where relationship issues should be deeply
felt--Lear's curse against Goneril, for instance, or his reunion with
daughter Cordelia.</TE>
<TE>   Stylistic inconsistencies also take their toll. This is a "King
Lear" in which nobody actually opens a letter but instead holds it
overhead and recites its contents. However all of the death scenes
are staged with cornball literalism, and Preston's interest in some
major characters, but not others, wrecks the staging's final hour.</TE>
<TE>   Here we focus on the Gloucester-Edgar subplot, with nearly
everyone else lined up against the back wall speaking into
floor-microphones as if performing some semi-staged reading: the
Reprise! "King Lear." Because the room's cavernous acoustic can't
clearly deliver all those amplified voices, the audience hears the
whole resolution of the play over headsets--but the static staging
and similarity of those voices frequently makes it impossible to
guess who's speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this crucial arc of the play, Preston delivers not
experimental or concept-driven Shakespeare or minimalist Shakespeare
but a bewildering botch, complete with unfortunate cuts, large and
small, in the adaptation by Royston Coppenger (everything from the
chronology of the final battle to the line "Pray you, undo this
button," just before Lear's death). So brush up your Shakespeare if
you plan to go; Preston's finale needs all the narrative clarity his
audience can bring to it.</TE>
<TE>   The final scene also unmans some of the strongest women--Mary Lou
Rosato as Kent, for example, previously on top of the role but here
hollowly punching out the words. Or Andrea LeBlanc and Tane Kawasaki,
both boldly vicious as daughters Goneril and Regan but here creating
no stir as they throw themselves at Edmund (the game, uneven Heather
Ehlers) and die in agony.</TE>
<TE>   Marissa Chibas keeps Edgar's plight urgent through the character's
devious actions, and Sydney Slayden brings a distinctive heat to
Cordelia's speeches. But you have to know the Fool's lines by heart
to penetrate Elina Lowensohn's accent in the role, and Joan MacIntosh
finds no through-line as Gloucester; the performance remains a
capably executed array of discontinuous effects.</TE>
<TE>   As Lear, Fran Bennett gives a performance of authority and
integrity in a narrow range--tetchy anger when banishing Cordelia,
tetchy madness at Dover, tetchy vulnerability as life ends. There's
no unsure moment, and none suggesting greatness of soul. Her blunt
fortitude may place her squarely in the Paul Scofield tradition, but
she lacks the directorial support that made Scofield's Lear belong to
a superbly unified and persuasive worldview.</TE>

<HD>Staging and Theme Make Good 'Company'</HD>
<DH>The pulse of Manhattan comes to life in a fresh Sondheim
revival set in 1970 that pits the single man against marriage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--The audience gets a bird's-eye perspective on midtown
Manhattan in Derek McLane's set for "Company" in the Kennedy Center's
Sondheim Celebration. On each side of the stage, skyscrapers recline
horizontally, their tops jutting out at the audience. Projections of
city street scenes, shot from overhead, occasionally cover the
backdrop.</LD>
<LD>   This viewpoint of a detached observer matches that of the
musical's central character, 35-year-old Bobby the bachelor. In this
landmark musical, first produced and set in 1970, Bobby carefully
notes the advantages and disadvantages of his friends' marriages and
wonders whether he will ever take the plunge himself.</LD>
<LD>   It's an ingenious match of set and theme, and McLane's set also
clears most of the space between the skyscrapers for plenty of
unimpeded movement by the cast as they approximate the busy
peregrinations of New Yorkers on the go in Jodi Moccia's
choreography.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, Sean Mathias' staging hums with the frantic pulse
of big-city life, even as it examines the essentially static thought
processes of its central character--a goal for any production of
"Company" but one that is met with dazzling success here.</TE>
<TE>   John Barrowman, who was seen in the Sondheim revue "Putting It
Together" at the Mark Taper Forum in 1998, plays Bobby as a grinning
Tom Cruise look-alike, a real "cutie," to quote one of his women
friends. He's more physically flirtatious than most Bobbys,
frequently touching his women friends with brief and seemingly
innocent caresses--a device that appears to be part of a decision by
the production's creators to banish the slightest consideration that
Bobby might be gay.</TE>
<TE>   This subject of sexual orientation has been controversial in the
history of "Company." In 1995, Sondheim and book writer George Furth
approved a London staging in which one of Bobby's male friends made
an incomplete pass at him. But in the same year, they disapproved a
Seattle staging in which the producers radically altered the show's
sexual road map without consulting the authors. Here, the incomplete
homosexual pass is again missing. Apparently the authors believe
Bobby is undecided enough without introducing additional ambivalence.</TE>
<TE>   The authorized 1995 productions also restored a previously cut
song, the incisive "Marry Me a Little," which fit Bobby so perfectly
that its absence in this latest version is hard to fathom.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in his climactic "Being Alive" number, Bobby finally makes
a decision, and Barrowman sings it with the requisite fervor. His
decision is sparked by his encounter with Lynn Redgrave's eagle-eyed
Joanne, who overdoes "The Ladies Who Lunch" exactly as required.
Walter Charles, also seen in the concurrent "Sweeney Todd," plays her
amiably forgiving husband.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the single most show-stopping scene belongs to Amy, the
neurotic off-and-on bride, who is embodied with peerless comic
precision by Alice Ripley. And Marcy Harriell is a dynamo as Marta,
the "Another Hundred People" girlfriend. The musical director is the
veteran Sondheim orchestrator Jonathan Tunick, whose appearance in
the pit draws especially warm applause from the houseful of
Sondheimaniacs.</TE>

<HD>These Aspiring Hamilton High Musicians Are 'Totally in
Tune'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Disney Channel's recent forays into unscripted television have
yielded some wonderfully entertaining programming in recent months,
and that happy trend continues tonight with a fascinating peek inside
a school for the performing arts in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Totally in Tune," a documentary on Hamilton High's magnet program
for music, premieres with a pair of half-hour episodes airing
back-to-back beginning at 8:30 p.m. The show's regular spot during
its 10-episode run will be Sundays at noon.</LD>
<LD>   The program's genius is its ability to create an immediate rapport
for viewers with many of the roughly 60 students in the orchestra who
share snippets of their lives with the filmmakers. Crisply edited
sound bites are accompanied by the first names and instrument(s) of
the subjects, and by the end of the first episode you feel as if you
already have a rooting interest in some of these people, complete
with their strengths, quirks and insecurities.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis, 15, has trouble keeping focus after being passed over for
a prized solo shot. Marcus, 16, worries that he'll let everyone down
at a live performance. Shura, 16, believes the orchestra has no
business playing before an audience without several more years of
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Evolution Film and Tape, the crackerjack production team behind
the Disney Channel's marvelous "Bug Juice" and "Totally Hoops"
unscripted series, filmed "Totally in Tune" over a four-month period
last year. On-campus rehearsals and performances, regular ability
tests for orchestra standing and a grand finale in San Francisco give
the series a natural dramatic thrust. The rest is up to the kids, and
there are bravura performances all around.</TE>

<HD>Youth Well-Served at Invitational</HD>
<DH>GLASS benefit displays a wider range of styles and more
risk-taking than in the past, and talented teenagers add to the
entertainment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pitches for donations, awards for teaching and lifetime achievement,
applause for every celebrity in the audience: The annual Los Angeles
Dance Invitational had more than dancing on its agenda Saturday at
the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Not merely a benefit for Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social
Services, the event often seemed a three-hour commercial for that
charity, reselling GLASS to an appreciative audience that walked in
the door already sold.</LD>
<LD>   If commercial dance had monopolized the Invitational in its
earliest editions, this new (fourth) incarnation displayed a broader
range of styles and a growing appetite for creative risk. And because
GLASS benefits young people, the presence of many talented, energetic
and well-coached teenage dancers proved appropriate as well as
entertaining.</LD>
<TE>   Winners of the 2002 Music Center Spotlight Awards highlighted this
emphasis on youth--long-limbed Diane N. Booth in a variation from the
ballet "Le Corsaire" and charismatic Timo Nunez-Bellamy in a
mercurial flamenco solo.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, an untitled five-choreographer medley by the youth
group Funkanometry played like a promo reel, with the incessant
changes in dance attack and music leading nowhere. The same tendency
weakened Ian Catindig's promising "What Lurks at Night," ensemble
hip-hop with a horror-film edge. And it nearly toppled Raymond G. del
Barrio's impossibly overcrowded "Oh Cassini" (music by Prince), a
tribute to Joe Cassini, winner of the Stanley Holden Award for
Distinguished Teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "Hittin' It," a tap septet for the 12- to 16-year-old members of
the Jazz Tap Ensemble's Caravan Project, nearly fell prey to the same
blur of steps and poses that dance medleys invite, but the solo for
prodigy Joseph Wiggan anchored the piece in sharply etched expertise.
Becky Twitchell and Channing Cook Holmes choreographed, with tap
virtuoso Holmes supplying the drum accompaniment but not dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Dramatic isolation linked three new narrative pieces. In Carol
Guidry's wistful duet "So Am I" (music by Gershwin), a woman drifted
in and out of a quasi-romantic partnership.</TE>
<TE>   In Mandy Moore's atmospheric "No Earthly Ships" (music
uncredited), a woman awaiting the return of her lover interacted with
an inventively swirling women's corps.</TE>
<TE>   And in Vickie Mendoza's quirky, enigmatic theater piece "Je Ne
Suis Pas 'Pathetique' " (music by Beethoven), a nurse with sylphide
wings dressed, aided and became swept up in the movement of a
withdrawn woman determined to dance.</TE>
<TE>   Familiar pleasures completed the evening, including Rei Aoo's
fluent ballet-jazz quintet "The Horsemen in Wilderness," Stephanie
Gilliland's powerhouse modern dance septet "Big Manuel" and Ballet
Folklorico del Pacifico's splashy, large-scale "Fiesta en Jalisco,"
credited to Adriana Astorga-Gainey.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa K. Lock's contortions on pointe in her "Winged" solo again
looked splendid and her black body veil made her seem encased in
mist.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Borgaro (replacing the announced Jamal Story) brought
technical security and fervor to "Endangered Species," Robert
Gilliam's glamorous remake of "The Dying Swan."</TE>
<TE>   In the nondance portions of the program, Broadway star Chita
Rivera exuded graciousness when accepting her lifetime achievement
award, executive producer Howard Ibach spoke of GLASS' mission in
moving personal terms and host Debbie Allen revealed the ability to
sustain a celebratory spirit by sheer force of will. The awards
presenters included Marty Krofft and Dee Dee Wood.</TE>

<HD>Andersen's Appeal Odds Seen as Poor</HD>
<DH>Courts: Firm vows to challenge verdict, but analysts doubt
it can survive long enough to follow through.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Arthur Andersen faces long odds if it appeals the
verdict against it, despite the novel legal issues raised in the
landmark criminal case, legal experts said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The wide discretion afforded to judges and juries by federal law,
analysts said, makes it unlikely that higher courts would reverse the
decision to convict the firm of obstruction of justice in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's inquiry into the collapse of
Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   With Andersen rapidly losing clients, however, many doubt the
onetime accounting giant will last long enough to see an appeal
through--a process that could take 18 months or more. The company
announced Saturday that it would cease auditing public companies Aug.
31--an action the Securities and Exchange Commission was widely
expected to demand as a result of the verdict.</LD>
<TE>   But Andersen, the first major accounting firm to be convicted of a
felony, has vowed to survive and to challenge the verdict. The
company still can audit private companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to continue to be an ongoing business in the
foreseeable future, and we fully intend to pursue an appeal,"
Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The company said in a statement that the grounds for a reversal
included "flawed jury instructions and erroneous evidentiary rulings"
by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon that prevented its lawyers from
putting on a complete defense.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the trial, Andersen raised potential avenues for
pursuit of an appeal in the event of a guilty verdict.</TE>
<TE>   One was an early decision by Harmon to allow prosecutors to
introduce accounting fraud allegations filed against Andersen
involving its audits of two other clients, Sunbeam Corp. and Waste
Management Inc. Federal rules of evidence prohibit prosecutors from
citing prior "bad acts" to tarnish the character of a defendant. But
the rules include an exception that permits prosecutors to use the
previous acts as evidence of motive.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Harmon's ruling, prosecutors told the jury that
Andersen--fearing harsh sanctions for yet another audit failure--had
the motive to impede the SEC's inquiry on Enron, an Andersen client
for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon was reversed by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in
1997 for making a similar decision to allow "bad acts" evidence in a
case involving Houston banker John Riddle. The higher court ruled
that Harmon had erred by allowing evidence of Riddle's involvement in
questionable dealings that were not related to the fraud charges
against him.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said her decision in the Andersen case is likely to
stand up on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor who specializes in
white-collar criminal defense, said the accounting firm will be able
to argue "quite compellingly that [Harmon's decision] had a
significant impact." But he said the SEC's allegations related to
Waste Management and Sunbeam "fall pretty squarely within those
widely recognized" exceptions to the "bad acts" rule.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also has raised questions about Harmon's rulings on
evidence turned over to the government for use in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin told Harmon during the trial
that she had committed "reversible error" by allowing prosecutors to
ask witnesses about personal notes taken by Andersen staff lawyer
Nancy Temple, who was not present. Temple invoked her right against
self-incrimination and refused to testify at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's lawyers could argue that Harmon's decision meant they
couldn't test the veracity of the notes or examine what Temple meant
when she wrote on Oct. 9 that an SEC inquiry was "highly probable."
But Mintz and other analysts predicted that prosecutors would be able
to convince a higher court that Harmon had acted within her
discretion on that point.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen may have a better chance of winning a reversal based on
the drama that unfolded after closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   A week into deliberations, the jury told Harmon it had become
deadlocked. Harmon decided to read the jury a so-called dynamite
charge, a special directive that tells jurors that failure to reach a
verdict will result in a mistrial and that the two sides have spent
enormous amounts of time and money trying the case.</TE>
<TE>   The judge took her instruction from a basic form written by a
panel of judges in the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas. But--over
Andersen's objection--she decided to leave out a line reminding the
jury that the defendant is presumed innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Levenson, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law
School and a former federal prosecutor, said the argument that the
dynamite charge was improper "has some substance to it, but it
depends on the [judicial] circuit."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals doesn't look favorably on
modifications to its model charge, Levenson noted. But the ultimate
importance of the dynamite charge may be learned only by digging into
jurors' recollections of their deliberations, and "there is a big
question mark about how much of the deliberative process becomes part
of the record," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say that in general, the dynamite charge serves an
important function by pushing tired jurors to take another stab at
reaching a consensus. But defense attorneys say the instruction can
be coercive.</TE>
<TE>   A recent University of Central Florida study of several hundred
federal cases found that, in cases in which a dynamite charge
resulted in a conviction, higher courts reversed about 24% of the
verdicts in full or in part.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also may seek to overturn the verdict based on the
jurors' comments after the trial. Jurors said Saturday that they were
not convinced by the government's theory that Andersen ordered
executives to shred documents to impede the SEC inquiry. Jurors said
they concluded that Temple had criminal intent when she asked
Houston-based auditor David B. Duncan to remove her name and
potentially damaging language from an internal memo before he drafted
a final version.</TE>
<TE>   Randal Picker, a professor at the University of Chicago law
school, said that the practice of having an executive run a memo past
his company's legal department for review amounted to "plain vanilla
normal" conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's all there was, then it strikes me that Arthur Andersen
has got a very good basis for an appeal," Picker said. "I find that
sort of astonishing."</TE>
<TE>   But other experts disagreed, saying higher courts have given
juries leeway in developing their own theories of cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, the appeals court will not get into what went on in
the jury room," Mintz said. "Unless it's something completely beyond
the pale, like the jury considering evidence that was not part of the
trial, they have to sort of give the jury every benefit" of the
doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "That sometimes creates a strange-sounding result, but it is not
that unusual for a jury to make a decision that 'we believe this case
turns on something none of the lawyers thought was important.' That
is something that is within their purview."</TE>
<TE>   Levenson agreed that appellate courts, as a general rule, don't
second-guess a jury's line of thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasoning behind this rule is we would never have finality,"
she said. "We presume in our system, maybe unfairly or incorrectly,
but we presume that if we give the jurors the right instructions and
the right evidence that their verdict is the right verdict."</TE>

<HD>Congress Members' Asset Reports Provide Peek Into Personal
Lives</HD>
<DH>Government: Financial disclosures show legislators hardly
are immune to the vagaries of the market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIET EILPERIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The collapse of Enron Corp. last year hit members of Congress in a
couple of places: where they make policy for the nation and where
they make--or lose--money for themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The fall into U.S. Bankruptcy Court by the Houston-based energy
firm ignited high-profile hearings and a broad debate over corporate
responsibility. In the meantime, it quietly clipped several lawmakers
who sold or held Enron stock as its value plummeted, according to
financial disclosure reports released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The reports, which each member of Congress must file annually,
provide a rare peek into legislators' personal lives. They reveal not
only their assets and stock trades but also what gifts they received
and extra money they earned on the side. Though members tend to be
worth much more on average than their constituents, the reports show
they are not immune to Wall Street's vagaries.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) lost at least $20,000 in Enron stock
trades. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) bought 185 Enron shares for more than
$1,600 and sold them for $125 the day after the company filed for
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), who chairs the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on energy and air quality, bought $4,500 of
Enron stock last fall when its shares were valued at $9 apiece and
its prospects for a merger with Dynegy Inc. were bright. By the time
he sold the 500 shares on Dec. 31, they were worth $895.</TE>
<TE>   Barton said Friday he still has "more than I want to admit" in
Enron stock, noting that his son Brad--a financial analyst--warned
him against the investment.</TE>
<TE>   "I showed I could lose money with the best of them," he said in an
interview, adding that he had learned his lesson. "It shows the
market works, and the market goes up and the market goes down."</TE>
<TE>   Other Enron losers included Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy (D-N.Y.), Rep. Gary Miller (R-Diamond Bar), Rep. C.L.
"Butch" Otter (R-Idaho) and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Enron owes Gramm's wife, Wendy, $500,000 to $1 million for serving
on its board of directors. By contrast, Becky Whetstone--wife of Rep.
Charlie Gonzalez (D-Texas)--lost only $30 in a series of Enron stock
transactions that began in February 2000 and ended by August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers suffered their losses elsewhere. Rep. Johnny
Isakson (R-Ga.) lost money on investments in Qwest Communications
International and Global Crossing Ltd. Both companies tanked amid
allegations of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   On a broader scale, Friday's disclosures reinforced the Senate's
image as a millionaire's club. Though lawmakers are compelled to list
their assets only within wide ranges, the rough approximations
provide a picture of their means.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.) reported $26.3 million to $52.8
million in assets, and Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.) a department store
heir, holds as much as $13 million.</TE>
<TE>   A few Democratic presidential contenders listed healthy portfolios
as well. Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), a former trial lawyer, has at
least $7.3 million and possibly as much as $33.6 million, most of it
in a blind trust. Teresa Heinz, the wife of Sen. John Kerry
(D-Mass.), has assets exceeding $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), a past chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
who spent tens of millions of dollars to win his seat in 2000,
reported one investment held in a blind trust worth at least $50
million. He valued four others at $5 million to $25 million each. In
August, his wife, Joanne, sold their Park Avenue condominium for at
least $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers do not have to disclose the value of their salary,
federal pensions, primary residence or checking accounts and savings
accounts worth less than $5,000. That leaves some House members with
little to report.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), who influences trillions of
dollars in federal funds as chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, listed no assets or liabilities. Prominent liberals
Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) and Lynn Rivers (D-Mich.) did the same, and
fellow progressive Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) listed more in loans
than in assets.</TE>
<TE>   "Government of the people occasionally means that some
representatives may, in fact, just like their constituents, live
paycheck to paycheck," Kucinich said. "My constituents are my
assets."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, House and Senate leaders are not nearly as rich
as most of their rank-and-file colleagues. House Speaker Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.) reported $405,000 to $1 million in assets. House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) holds $134,000 to $610,000
in 26 stock funds but owes $65,000 to $150,000 in student loans for
his children.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), who is retiring this
year, listed no assets but reported a line of credit at Wells Fargo
of $15,000 to $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The recent ascension of House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) has significantly boosted the House leadership's overall
wealth. She reported assets of at least $23.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Pelosi's wealth stems from her husband, Paul, an
investment banker. Pelosi, known for showering her aides and
colleagues with gourmet meals, frequently quips at the outset, "Thank
God for Paul Pelosi!"</TE>
<TE>   The reports also provided an epilogue for the travails of Rep.
Gary Condit (D-Ceres), who lost his seat after his relationship with
slain intern Chandra Levy became public. He sold his Adams Morgan
condo last year, netting $50,000 to $100,000.</TE>

<HD>Dixie Chicks, Sony End Feud With a New Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than 10 months after accusing Sony Corp. of "systematic
thievery," the Dixie Chicks signed a lucrative new pact with the
Japanese conglomerate that may be announced as early as today,
industry sources said.</LD>
<LD>   After filing suit against Sony last year claiming breach of
contract, the Nashville trio went public with its complaint,
crusading for artists' rights at fund-raisers and griping to
lawmakers about greedy record corporations taking advantage of naive
artists.</LD>
<LD>   The Dixie Chicks' management team, the Firm, capitalized on that
position as a negotiating tactic and was able to forge a new pact
Friday with an estimated $20-million signing advance, industry
sources said. The pact requires that the musicians reimburse Sony for
about $15 million from record sales before collecting royalties. In
addition, the trio's managers and lawyers are expected to reap fees
estimated at $3 million, or about 15% of the $20-million transaction,
sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Sony agreed to significantly boost the Nashville trio's royalty
rate to about 20%, sources said. The next Dixie Chicks CD, "Home,"
due out Aug. 27, will be the first release on the trio's own Wide
Open Records label, which will be distributed through Sony's Columbia
division and its Nashville Monument arm. Any records released on the
new label will be marketed and promoted through Sony.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Sony and the Dixie Chicks did not return calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Dixie Chicks--Emily Robison, Martha Seidel and Natalie Maines
Pasdar--have sold nearly 20 million albums, generating more than $175
million in revenue for Sony since 1997. The Grammy-winning trio,
which signed a seven-album deal with Sony in 1997, is one of the most
popular and commercially successful recording and performing acts in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The singers are the latest superstars to sue their label only to
back down after receiving a fat advance. Among those who have
threatened legal action are Don Henley, Luther Vandross and Beck.</TE>
<TE>   A breach-of-contract case involving rock star Courtney Love and
Vivendi Universal is scheduled to go to trial this week but is likely
to be postponed. The judge has requested that Love and Vivendi
resolve the matter out of court. Over the last few weeks, the two
parties have been working to settle the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The Dixie Chicks' fight with Sony erupted in July 2001, after the
trio sent a letter notifying the corporation that the act would no
longer record for Sony. Sony responded weeks later by suing them,
alleging it was owed damages for five undelivered albums, the value
of which the company estimated at more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, the music group countersued, accusing Sony of
engaging in "systematic thievery" to "swindle" recording artists out
of royalty earnings.</TE>
<TE>   In their suit, the country-pop singers said Sony cheated them out
of more than $4 million by underreporting sales figures and
overcharging for company services. Sony's "fraudulent accounting
gimmicks" were uncovered, the suit said, during an audit, financed by
the singers, of the company's financial records.</TE>
<TE>   The singers said they caught Sony trying to hide money from them
with bogus accounting tactics on 30 separate occasions since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   At its core, the performers' suit called into question the
"unconscionable" terms that young artists are required to accept when
signing a standard industry recording contract. Like most entry-level
artists, the trio had no bargaining power when its first contract was
drafted, the suit said, allowing Sony to treat its standard offer as
nonnegotiable.</TE>
<TE>   Sony officials dismissed the Dixie Chicks' allegations as a "sham"
attempt to escape its record contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We refuse to sit back and silently endorse this behavior simply
because this is a 'standard' practice at Sony," the Dixie Chicks said
the day after filing their suit.</TE>
<TE>   Within months, the singers had joined the burgeoning artists'
rights movement, lobbying legislators in Sacramento to evaluate
recording contracts and industry accounting practices. The trio also
appeared at a concert benefit in February to raise funds for the
Recording Artists Coalition, a nascent trade group comprising 100
top-selling acts seeking reforms in the music business.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, representatives for the Dixie Chicks met with
EMI Group and Bertelsmann Music Group to shop for a new deal based on
a new model involving smaller advances, larger back-end royalties,
fewer deductions and more-transparent accounting methods.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to strike such a pact with any of Sony's competitors, they
quietly returned to the negotiating table with the Japanese
conglomerate in April, sources said.</TE>

<HD>Verdict Puts Ex-Auditor in a Tough Spot</HD>
<DH>Witness: With his testimony repudiated, many wonder whether
David Duncan was foolish to plead guilty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neither government prosecutors nor David B. Duncan himself, the
admitted scofflaw at Arthur Andersen who oversaw the auditing of
Enron Corp., could have foreseen that jurors might not buy his
testimony or his professed guilt.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan, after all, was supposed to be the government's star
witness who would tell the inside story of how Andersen shredded
documents related to its faulty audit of Enron in a desperate rush to
destroy evidence of its own culpability.</LD>
<LD>   But the jury rejected Duncan's testimony and even rejected the
argument that the shredding of Enron-related documents by Andersen
employees was a crime. Instead, an in-house lawyer who has not been
charged and who refused to testify was held up as the "corrupt
persuader" who attempted to thwart a government investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Now many are wondering whether Duncan, who is still facing a
possible prison sentence but is cooperating with the Justice
Department's investigation of Enron's collapse, was misguided or
foolish to plead guilty in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   At best, the only work the well-heeled accountant, who was paid
about $700,000 in salary last year, will find is as a cut-rate
corporate executive in the little leagues of American business,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, a father of three, is certain to lose his accounting
license after sentencing, which is set for August. He is barred from
making any profit by selling his story.</TE>
<TE>   And although he copped a guilty plea in negotiations with federal
prosecutors earlier this year, Duncan testified that he did not think
he was doing anything wrong at the time he shredded documents last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "He may say to himself, 'I made the wrong decision,' " said Leslie
D. Corwin, a New York lawyer with Greenberg Traurig who represents
national accounting firms, executives and partners. "Obviously the
jury was very confused by him and his role.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't find him to be the 'corrupt persuader,' and yet he
pleaded guilty," he said. "And he still faces jail. You can't put a
corporation in jail. Only people go to jail. To give up one's rights
and plead guilty is an awfully hard decision.... How can you not feel
for Duncan on a personal level? But, for whatever reason with legal
advice, he made a decision. He obviously had something to sell."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's attorney, Samuel Seymour, reached Sunday night, said his
client was "totally comfortable with his testimony and the verdict,
and he will continue his cooperation with the government." Seymour, a
lawyer with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York, declined further
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan headed Andersen's Enron team, whose work earned the firm
about $1 million in weekly fees but which was viewed by some as
perhaps too close to its clients. The team worked out of Enron's
headquarters, and its members, including Duncan, attended golf
tournaments and went on ski trips with Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   After the document shredding came to light, Andersen executives
made a splash by abruptly firing Duncan and announcing, "Andersen
will not tolerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or
willful violation of our policies."</TE>
<TE>   But when Duncan testified for the government at Andersen's trial,
Rusty Hardin, the firm's lead lawyer, cast him in a much kinder
light. In a strange twist, that strategy appears both to have failed
to clear the firm and to have helped convince at least some jurors
that Duncan was not the bad egg.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us disagreed on David Duncan," said Jack Gallo, a juror
who spoke at a news conference after the verdict was announced
Saturday. "Some of us believed him, and some of us didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Gallo added, without elaboration, that he believed Duncan had
violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they saw Duncan's testimony about document shredding
as a peripheral issue and did not incorporate it in their
consideration of whether Andersen was guilty of obstruction of
justice.</TE>
<TE>   "All this business about telling people to shred documents, that
was superficial and largely circumstantial," foreman Oscar Criner
said.</TE>
<TE>   The jury didn't find Duncan credible, raising questions about how
other jurors might feel in future cases, should the government choose
to put him on the stand again.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just very clear that he had a lot of baggage that
indicated he was capable of not telling the truth, particularly on
his relations with Enron and with the people who were doing those
funny deals," Criner said.</TE>
<TE>   The Andersen trial underscored that the government can go only so
far with Duncan, said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola University
constitutional law professor and a former federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "He was damaged goods to start out with, and all they have now is
confirmation that, yes, he is damaged goods," she said. "How much
will they use him? Only as much as they have to. But right now, it's
unclear who they have to take his place."</TE>
<TE>   Others said only time will tell how valuable Duncan could be to
the ongoing investigation of Enron's meltdown. Duncan's sentencing is
expected to be postponed for months, maybe even years, as
investigators sort it out and build other cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Duncan already basically sold his soul to the devil," said
Corwin, the New York partnership lawyer. Prosecutors "did it because
they need him for the long run. I think part of his deal is, 'I will
plead to this, and I will cooperate with the government'--not only in
the Andersen trial but also in the Enron trial. I think they are
going to see the value of his cooperation for years to come."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's cooperation will exact a toll, Corwin said. "Who would
hire him knowing this is someone who publicly is out there saying,
'My job from 9 to 5 is working for the government of the United
States now, sorting through Enron documents.' His life is on hold now
while this whole thing settles out. That in itself is a heavy
burden."</TE>
<TE>   When Duncan does free himself from his legal obligations, the
scandal will haunt him in his search for a new job, said Jeffrey
Christian, founder of Christian &amp; Timbers executive search firm and
author of the forthcoming book "Headhunter's Edge."</TE>
<TE>   "His career is over," Christian said. "It's going to be a very
different world for him. Hopefully he has some money saved up."</TE>
<TE>   His best shot at finding employment would be as a chief financial
officer, a position that does not require an accounting license, but
large, publicly held companies probably would shy away from hiring
him, Christian said.</TE>
<TE>   "He will have to rely on the relationships he's built with clients
where he's helped make them money," he said. "He could go to work for
a company where he is a bargain. He would have to represent a skill
set that a company generally couldn't afford, and they would see him
as a valuable resource at rock-bottom prices."</TE>
<TE>   Harold J. Krent, dean of the Chicago-Kent College of Law and an
expert on criminal law, said the beliefs of a few jurors in the
Andersen trial doesn't mean Duncan would have been exonerated had he
been on trial.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had been a trial against Duncan, the government would have
had a different perspective, could have used other evidence, and it
would have been a different jury," Krent said.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have to weigh the risks of greater penalty when you
decide to plea. [Duncan] may be frustrated, but that's our system. I
don't think he has reason to kick himself too hard."</TE>

<DH>Telecom: Creditors will comb statements for signs of
inappropriate disbursements made before Chapter 11 filing.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the months before filing for bankruptcy protection, Global
Crossing Ltd. shelled out millions of dollars in precious cash to
executives, outside consultants and companies with ties to Global
Crossing officials, according to newly released company reports.</LD>
<LD>   The payments, some of which appear highly unusual, are included in
the financial statements that list bills, salaries, severance,
expense reimbursements and other items paid by Global Crossing Ltd.
and subsidiary Global Crossing Development Co. in 2001, the year
before the company filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Jan. 28.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing's reports, filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New York, are not definitive and are subject to revision. Some of
the payments listed may not have been honored by the company's banks
or otherwise were not paid to the listed recipient. In addition,
although Global Crossing Ltd. and Global Crossing Development are the
two most active entities, the holding company has more than 100 other
subsidiaries with separate financial statements.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokeswoman Cynthia Artin said the company is "not
going to comment on any of the specifics" in the reports.</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications company, which operates a worldwide
fiber-optic network, grew quickly after its founding in 1998, but
revenue dried up when the telecom market disintegrated last year and
the company was unable to repay its huge debt. With cash
disappearing, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in an
attempt to eliminate its debt and restructure its business.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's filings are of intense interest to Global Crossing's many
creditors, who will comb the statements for signs of
inappropriate--or fraudulent--payments that can be reclaimed to boost
any potential payback.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, creditors and others may look hard at payments made
by Global Crossing to Chicago-based Withit, a little-known firm that
uses the Internet to stream content to large financial services
companies, according to the firm's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Withit's president is the son of Joseph Perrone, Global Crossing's
executive vice president of finance. A deal between Global Crossing
and Withit was announced by the companies a year ago, but the
financial terms and the nature of the deal were not disclosed at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   The financial reports show that Withit received payments of
$739,506 in the last six months of 2001 from a subsidiary called
Global Crossing Network Center (U.K.) Ltd., including a $250,000
payment Nov. 28--just two months before Global Crossing's bankruptcy
filing. That payment was listed as part of a "product development
agreement" with Withit.</TE>
<TE>   Critics raised questions this year about a potential conflict of
interest, but Global Crossing declined to discuss the matter and
wouldn't say how much Withit had been paid. The company said it had
turned the matter over to outside attorneys for review.</TE>
<TE>   John Legere, Global Crossing's chief executive, said in March that
"at this point in time, there is nobody that is guilty of any
wrongdoing associated with [Withit] that we know of."</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, Global Crossing issued a statement on the
matter, saying, "Possible conflict of interest matters are being
thoroughly investigated by the special committee of Global Crossing's
board of directors with the assistance of independent outside
counsel. Prior to the completion of that process, it would be
premature to comment."</TE>
<TE>   Trade-Show and PR Firms Among Payees</TE>
<TE>   Perrone has been in the spotlight in recent months because he
worked at accounting firm Arthur Andersen and was in charge of the
Global Crossing account before quitting to join the company. Some of
Global Crossing's accounting methods are under investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Other payments listed in the reports include:</TE>
<TE>   * $120,453 to Wingsite, a trade show services firm owned by the
brother of David Walsh, a former Global Crossing executive.</TE>
<TE>   * $231,670 to Sitrick &amp; Co., a public relations firm that has
represented Gary Winnick, Global Crossing's chairman and founder.</TE>
<TE>   * $2.9 million paid to accounting firm Andersen in the two months
before Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   * $12.6 million paid to Accenture, a consulting firm spun off from
Andersen, in December and January.</TE>
<TE>   * $1.4 million in rent and service fees paid in 2001 to Brownstein
Hyatt &amp; Farber, a consulting firm affiliated with former Global
Crossing board member Norman Brownstein.</TE>
<TE>   * $4.2 million in rent and other fees paid in 2001 to North
Crescent Realty V, Global Crossing's Beverly Hills landlord and a
company controlled by Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   * $15.4 million paid to attorneys, accountants and others in
January for fees related to the firm's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The reports also show that Global Crossing's top executives
benefited from a generous expense account.</TE>
<TE>   Expense payments of several thousand dollars were a regular
feature throughout the filings, though they are possibly explained by
the need for international travel to oversee the company's worldwide
fiber-optic network.</TE>
<TE>   Former CEO Casey's Expenses Atypical</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest expense account beneficiaries was a former
chief executive, Thomas J. Casey, whose expenses last year totaled
nearly $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although a few were low--$1.08 or $152, most were more
substantial, and eight payments totaling $190,000 were unlike typical
expenses because they were for even amounts--$60,000, $10,000 and six
for $20,000 each. The filing did not explain what was covered by the
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Casey received a salary of more than $91,000 a month plus an
annual bonus of $1.1 million and had an $8-million loan that was
forgiven along with $336,828 as interest on the loan. He also
received $328,183 to cover taxes on the loan, which essentially
amounted to additional compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Casey also received nearly $3.5 million in severance when he left
the company at the end of October, for a total 2001 compensation,
excluding stock options, of more than $13 million in cash and loans
that didn't have to be repaid.</TE>
<TE>   Company founder Gary Winnick picked up a $1-million bonus, and his
investment company, Pacific Capital Group, recouped about $380,000
for expenses it paid on behalf of Global Crossing. The filing did not
explain what those expenses covered. Winnick was paid a base salary
of more than $73,000 a month, and his expenses were relatively small
compared with others': a little more than $58,000, including one
payment of an even $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the reports, about 30 directors and five chief
executives, along with numerous other senior executives, went through
the corporate turnstiles at Global Crossing since it became a public
company in 1998. Last year, according to the company's filing, nine
directors and two vice chairmen left the company, and six top
executives, including CEO Casey, quit.</TE>
<TE>   The company also listed 139 workers' compensation cases pending
against it, along with 15 securities fraud lawsuits and eight other
pending legal matters.</TE>
<TE>   According to Global Crossing's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the
nation's fourth-largest, the company had $12.4 billion in debt and
$22.4 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, asset write-downs and other reassessments have
steadily chipped away at the official value of the company's assets.</TE>

<HD>Working Families Worried About Buying a Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Half of America's low- and moderate-income families see down payments
and closing costs as major obstacles to buying a home, according to a
study released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-one percent believe that the lack of affordable homes is a
very or fairly big problem, says the study commissioned by the Fannie
Mae Foundation, a group that advocates affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers commissioned by the foundation surveyed 300 working
families--metropolitan-area households with children and at least one
employed adult and incomes up to $54,000, the national median. They
also polled 1,004 adults nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   "For many working Americans, squeezed between incomes that aren't
rising nearly as fast as housing costs, the result is that more and
more worry about finding a home in a community where they are
comfortable living," said Stacey Davis, the foundation's chief
executive and president.</TE>
<TE>   The study found regional differences in the level of concern about
affordable housing. Just over half living on the West Coast and 40%
in the Northeast think the lack of affordable homes is a big problem,
compared with 34% in the South and 28% in the Midwest.</TE>

<HD>Source of Tip on ImClone Drug Is Identified</HD>
<DH>Probe: Lobbyist passed along word, which reached the
Waksals, that the FDA would reject firm's Erbitux.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN GILLIS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The previously unidentified consultant who obtained and passed along
critical information in the ImClone Systems Inc. stock scandal was
Samuel D. Turner, a prominent lawyer and Capitol Hill lobbyist who
has long represented health-care interests in Washington and has
cultivated ties at the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   A Capitol Hill source named Turner this weekend after days of
uncertainty about the identity of the intermediary who conveyed word
that ImClone's cancer drug, Erbitux, was about to be rejected by the
FDA. Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who has led an investigation of
the matter, confirmed the intermediary's identity.</LD>
<LD>   ImClone's former chief executive, Samuel D. Waksal, was arrested
last week and charged with violating securities laws by tipping off
relatives after he received the information so they could sell stock
before the public was informed.</LD>
<TE>   Turner did not return messages and calls.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear that Turner did anything wrong. Greenwood said he
understood that Turner was formally representing Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., ImClone's partner on Erbitux, at the time he passed along the
FDA information. If that is true, the FDA official who gave Turner
the information, Richard Pazdur, almost certainly had a legal right
to do so, and Turner would have had a right to receive it.</TE>
<TE>   But that does not mean people who received Turner's information
had the right to sell shares ahead of the bad news. Some members of
Congress have said the FDA "leak" was unwise at best. And it has fed
investor suspicions of other leaks at the FDA that are being used to
earn unfair securities trading profits. "Short sellers," investors
who bet a stock will fall, made millions late last year by placing
bets against ImClone's shares in the weeks before the FDA rejected
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Sources Saturday filled out some of the details in a chain of
events that was the subject of testimony last week before a House
panel headed by Greenwood. These events in December cost investors
millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Erbitux, designed to slow tumor growth, had been under development
for years. New York drug giant Bristol-Myers agreed last fall to pay
as much as $2 billion for a stake in ImClone, also of New York, and
for rights to the drug. By December, ImClone had submitted test data
to the FDA that it hoped would lead to final approval, and the
company's stock had soared.</TE>
<TE>   But FDA reviewers found numerous problems with ImClone's
application. They decided in mid-December to reject it but did not
tell the company, ordering ImClone to stop pestering them and to
await a final decision on Dec. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers executives apparently asked Turner, who had
represented the company on Capitol Hill, to find out what he could.
Bristol-Myers spokeswoman Tracey Furey said Saturday that she was
uncertain whether Turner was formally representing the company in
December, and she declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony before the House panel indicated that a Bristol-Myers
"consultant" called an FDA official Dec. 24 and got confirmation that
Erbitux was about to be rejected. The Washington Post in Saturday's
editions identified the FDA officer as Pazdur; he did not return
calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Turner "did what he was used to doing, which is calling the folks
[at the FDA] and saying, 'What's up with the application?' "
Greenwood said. "Pazdur said, 'Yeah, it's looking pretty bad.' "</TE>
<TE>   Three Bristol-Myers executives received an e-mail, evidently from
Turner, just before Christmas, and on Christmas Day they gave the bad
news to Harlan W. Waksal, then ImClone's chief operating officer.
Waksal contacted his brother, CEO Samuel Waksal, the next morning.
Samuel Waksal allegedly informed relatives who owned ImClone shares,
and several of them sold large blocks of stock on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The news was made public Dec. 28, and when trading resumed Dec. 31
the shares plunged. Samuel Waksal resigned last month, as criminal
charges neared, and Harlan Waksal replaced him.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood said Saturday that he did not think Pazdur or Turner had
acted improperly. Both are respected by cancer advocates, and
Pazdur's name has even been floated as a potential FDA commissioner.
Greenwood said the FDA should have told ImClone of its reservations
early and given the company time to correct the Erbitux application.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials have declined to discuss the issue of a leak but
have said an internal investigation is underway.</TE>

<HD>Company Fading From Big 5 Picture</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Staff and client defections mount, giving the
firm's four largest rivals a growth spurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. accounting industry is expected to undergo a major
transformation in the months ahead in the wake of Arthur Andersen's
conviction of obstruction of justice.</LD>
<LD>   Already, industry power is consolidating into an oligarchy of four
giant firms--Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte &amp; Touche
and KPMG International. What used to be called the Big Five is
shaping up as the Big Four.</LD>
<LD>   Firms that previously were small players in specific industries
such as energy and gaming will gain new clout as they pick up pieces
of Andersen's crumbling empire.</LD>
<TE>   And the gap between the largest of the Big Four
(PricewaterhouseCoopers) and the smallest (KPMG) will narrow as
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte &amp; Touche divest themselves of
their consulting businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, PricewaterhouseCoopers collected about $9.3 billion in
U.S. revenue, $5 billion more than KPMG. A year from now, analysts
expect that difference to shrink to $2.5 billion or less.</TE>
<TE>   Before Enron Corp.'s debacle, Andersen had 26,000 staff members,
nearly 2,000 partners and annual U.S. revenue of $4 billion. It was
noted for its expertise in the energy, hotel, casino, airline and
natural resources industries, as well as its tax work.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Patrick Dorton said the firm now has about 10,000
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Client defections began in January with the disclosure that
Andersen shredded Enron audit documents, and accelerated with the
unsealing of an indictment March 14 charging Andersen with one count
of obstruction of justice. The firm's conviction Saturday is widely
seen as a mortal wound.</TE>
<TE>   A compilation by The Times of auditor-change filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and other public documents shows
Andersen has lost more than 720 of its 2,300 public-company clients.
That represents almost $1.3 billion in business.</TE>
<TE>   But Dorton said the firm is shrinking faster than the records
show. On Saturday, the firm notified the SEC that it will cease
auditing public companies Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young looks to be the biggest winner from Andersen's
meltdown, gaining 189 former Andersen clients, or more than a quarter
of the business that has defected from the troubled accounting firm.
Combined, they made up $300 million of Andersen's $4 billion in U.S.
revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also has aggressively courted Andersen's partners,
reaching agreements to hire about 200 partners and at least 1,000
staff members in many regions, including important business centers
such as New York and Los Angeles and small markets such as Baltimore;
Richmond, Va.; and Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, Ernst &amp; Young has signed 54 of the 83 overseas
partnerships that once made up the Andersen Worldwide confederation,
a move that greatly expands its international reach and will feed
multinational business back to its U.S. offices.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of Ernst &amp; Young's consulting practice two years ago
paved the way for the growth the firm is seeing this year, allowing
it to invest in sectors such as technology, entertainment, real
estate and hospitality, said Tony Anderson, managing partner for
Ernst &amp; Young's Pacific Southwest Area.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere are Ernst &amp; Young's gains from Andersen's fall more
evident than in the hotel industry. Before this year, Ernst &amp; Young's
biggest hotel client was the Six Continents Hotel Group, a British
company best known for its Holiday Inn chain.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last several months, Ernst &amp; Young has won the business
of former Andersen clients Hilton Hotels Corp., Marriott
International Inc., Westin Hotels and Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts
Worldwide Inc., and now audits hotel companies that combined account
for more than $4 out of every $10 collected by U.S.-based hospitality
companies, said Jonathan Hamilton, who publishes the Public
Accounting Report, an industry newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   In real estate, Ernst &amp; Young has picked up about half the clients
that abandoned Andersen, including Centex Corp., the big Dallas-based
home builder, and real estate investment trusts such as Nationwide
Health Properties Inc. of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte &amp; Touche also benefited from Andersen's troubles,
becoming the dominant accounting firm in the gaming industry by
hiring two of Andersen's top partners in its casino practice and
winning a number of important clients, including Trump Hotels &amp;
Casino Resorts Inc., Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and MGM Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte, long the No. 2 player in the business, now audits 70% of
the publicly traded U.S. gaming companies, Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also has made a big move in the airline industry, now
auditing two of the three largest U.S. airlines after capturing
longtime Andersen audit clients UAL Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Deloitte, which previously had not been in the top
echelon in the tax business, became a major player by hiring 2,000
Andersen tax staff members, including 200 partners, said Allan
Koltin, a Chicago accounting industry consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's energy practice is being divvied up among the major
accounting firms, with each picking up significant clients.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers each has gained more than $200
million of former Andersen business by winning major clients.</TE>
<TE>   Art Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report, an industry
newsletter, said he believes that the surviving Big Four will gain
from Andersen's demise through strategic moves that solidify their
positions in specific industries or regions. Each will be able to
increase its U.S. business by $500 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   "The only difference is in how much they have won," Bowman said.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of Andersen's major accounts have been spoken for,
Bowman thinks the accounting industry is headed for several years of
turmoil as many former Andersen clients make multiple switches in
auditors.</TE>
<TE>   "These clients have to find somebody this year, but then they will
look for the firm that has the most expertise in their industry,"
Bowman said.</TE>
<TE>   The conviction Saturday in federal court in Houston isn't the end
of Andersen's woes. Andersen still faces an SEC investigation into
its work for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Andersen is being sued by investors who lost billions of
dollars in Enron's collapse, and it faces hundreds of millions of
dollars in liability.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has hired bankruptcy and reorganization specialist Bryan
Marsal to oversee the downsizing of the firm. Bowman expects the firm
ultimately to declare bankruptcy and dissolve this fall or winter.</TE>
<TE>   One question that remains unanswered is whether any of the firms
winning Andersen's business or hiring its partners will find
themselves targets of angry Enron plaintiffs and creditors that had
hoped to collect damages from Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for these groups are examining the issue of "successor
liability" for the firms that wind up with Andersen staff and offices
and have sought more information about the deals.</TE>
<TE>   A federal bankruptcy judge in New York recently rejected an effort
by Enron creditors to force Andersen to provide more information
about its finances and practice sales, but he left the door open for
the creditors to get the information at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys seeking damages from an accounting firm that has
taken over an Andersen practice will be venturing into new legal
territory, said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law
professor.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys usually have a clear target--the so-called successor
company that assumes the business of a failed company. But in the
case of Andersen, three or four could be seen as successors, Coffee
said, and there is no legal precedent for this situation.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson of Ernst &amp; Young said he believes that the firm's
dealings with Andersen will be clear of liability.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not acquire offices of firms," he said. "We hired people,
and you can't stop somebody from hiring people, regardless of what
firm they came from."</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, there is not a clear answer as to whether
there will be a successor liability issue, but certainly there are
question marks," said Dennis Nally, PricewaterhouseCoopers' senior
U.S. partner.</TE>
<TE>   PricewaterhouseCoopers, concerned that it could be dragged into
protracted litigation over the issue, has taken a different approach,
trying to win clients through the traditional proposal, or bidding,
process. Nally said accounts won this way are less likely to face a
successor liability challenge since the business is won on merits and
not through a purchase or the hiring of a particular partner.</TE>
<TE>   Nally also believes that the method provides a more orderly way to
acquire business. His firm only recently regained its equilibrium
after its creation through the merger of Pricewaterhouse and Coopers
&amp; Lybrand International four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Acquiring more offices and partners from Andersen would create
another difficult transition that PricewaterhouseCoopers plans to
avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who says integrating large accounting firms is an easy
task is fooling themselves," Nally said.</TE>

<TE>   The Andersen Ripple Effect</TE>
<TE>   The rapid erosion of accounting firm Arthur Andersen has altered
the power structure in the accounting world. Here are some of the
significant changes in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Five</TE>
<TE>   Before this year, five giant firms dominated the accounting
industry. Andersen, regardless of whether it survives, will fall out
of the top ranks, leaving the industry controlled by four firms.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas</TE>
<TE>   Of the 83 overseas partnerships that once made up the Andersen
Worldwide confederation, 54 have gone to Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines</TE>
<TE>   By picking up UAL Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. as clients from
Andersen, Deloitte audits two of the three largest U.S. airlines and
is well positioned to pick up more aviation business.</TE>
<TE>   Hotels</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young has won former Andersen clients Hilton Hotels Corp.,
Marriott International Inc., Westin Hotels and Starwood Hotels &amp;
Resorts Worldwide Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Gaming</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte hired two of Andersen's top partners in its casino
practice and has won a series of high-profile clients, including
Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc., Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and
MGM Mirage.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to attract more mass appeal for an online search engine with a
cult following, AlltheWeb.com is expected to announce today that it
indexes more Internet information than longtime pacesetter Google
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   AlltheWeb, owned by Norway's Fast Search &amp; Transfer, says its
database spans 2.1 billion Web pages, just ahead of the 2.07 billion
scanned by Google at the end of last week.</LD>
<LD>   AlltheWeb has been quietly building on its previous foundation of
800 million pages in the last two months.</LD>
<TE>   The rapid expansion represents the latest salvo aimed at Mountain
View, Calif.-based Google, whose growing popularity since its
inception in 1998 has inspired a mixture of awe, jealousy and
one-upmanship among competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The challenges haven't toppled Google so far. Closely held Google
operates one of the Web's most trafficked destinations and provides
search results for other prominent sites, such as Yahoo and AOL.</TE>
<TE>   AlltheWeb's effectiveness has made it a hit among scientists,
librarians and other researchers looking for more-obscure data.</TE>

<HD>Investors Still Wary of Stock Tumult</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters, Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plunging stock prices have sent benchmark indexes tumbling to lows
not seen since late September, but don't expect the bargain cavalry
to ride in and lasso beaten-down stocks this week.</LD>
<LD>   Prices may have dropped, but there's still too much risk to make
new long-term bets on stocks, strategists and fund managers say.</LD>
<LD>   "There are geopolitical risks, possibilities of more terrorist
attacks and the ongoing concern about corporate skulduggery," said
Tim Woolston, who helps manage $3.5 billion for Boston Advisors Inc.
"The market has more to work through at the lower end--Nasdaq, in
particular."</LD>
<TE>   Last week, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq
composite index declined 2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 1.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Stock prices this week could swing widely as Wall Street
scrutinizes the profits of investment banks and the earnings
pre-announcements of other companies, reshuffles portfolios as the
quarter ends, and factors in the so-called triple witching day, when
options, index options and futures contracts expire simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street probably will greet this week's report on the consumer
price index, the broadest gauge of consumer-level inflation, with a
yawn.</TE>
<TE>   The overall May CPI is forecast to rise 0.1%, according to
economists surveyed by Reuters. In April, the overall CPI gained
0.5%.</TE>
<TE>   This week will bring the first trickle in a flood of quarterly
corporate earnings pre-announcements. The ratio of warnings to
positive outlooks has shrunk recently, according to market research
firm Thomson Financial/First Call. But Wall Street is more willing to
sell on bad news than buy on good news these days.</TE>
<TE>   Other economic data due this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report on housing starts
in May.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on the U.S. trade
deficit in April.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board will issue its index of leading economic
indicators for May.</TE>

<HD>German Construction Workers to Strike</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>German construction workers are set to strike for the first time in
post-war history today in a pay dispute that marks the latest round
of labor unrest in a turbulent election year.</LD>
<LD>   The strike in the building sector comes at an awkward moment for
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who is fighting an uphill battle to win
re-election in September and only recently began closing the gap in
surveys on his challenger Edmund Stoiber.</LD>
<LD>   The IG Bau union said several thousand workers at building sites
in Berlin and Hamburg will walk off the job and the strikes gradually
will be expanded nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   The union, which represents 340,000 of the 950,000 workers in the
sector, said Saturday that workers voted by an overwhelming 98.6%
majority to strike.</TE>
<TE>   The union is seeking a 4.5% pay increase for its members whose
contracts ended in March. Employers offered a 3% raise starting in
September and a one-off payment of $94.54 in August, effectively a
1.7% rise.</TE>

<LD>A group of Northwest Airlines Corp. flight attendants will begin a
campaign today to replace the Teamsters union with a new, independent
union.</LD>
<LD>   The Professional Flight Attendants Assn. would be headquartered in
Minneapolis and be made up of Northwest flight attendants, said PFAA
spokesman Gary Helton.</LD>
<LD>   In order for the PFAA to replace the Teamsters, 50% plus one
additional flight attendant must sign and submit an authorization
card requesting a union change. The National Mediation Board would
then call for an election.</LD>
<TE>   Northwest, the world's fourth-largest carrier, has 11,000 flight
attendants.</TE>

<HD>Qwest's CEO Steps Down at Board's Request</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Joseph Nacchio had been losing control of the
company, which named Tellabs chief as his successor, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. Chief Executive Joseph
Nacchio resigned, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Nacchio resigned at the request of the company's directors because
of the board's concern over Qwest's financial and regulatory
troubles, the paper said, citing the unidentified people. The board
on Sunday named Richard Notebaert, chief executive of Tellabs Inc.,
the company's new chairman and chief executive, the paper said.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, Nacchio had been losing control of Qwest to
company founder and co-chairman Phil Anschutz and to Craig Slater, a
board member and an associate of Anschutz, the paper reported, citing
people familiar with the matter. The decision to oust Nacchio wasn't
the result of any particular, or new, negative development, the paper
said, citing the people.</LD>
<TE>   Nacchio declined to comment, and Notebaert, a former CEO of
telecom firm Ameritech before it was acquired by SBC Communications
Inc. in 1999, couldn't be reached to comment, the Journal reported.</TE>
<TE>   Nacchio's departure from the company he helped to nurture almost
from its founding in 1996 comes as the telecommunications industry
faces a deepening crisis. Massive construction of new fiber-optic
capacity, for which sufficient demand hasn't materialized, has left
companies swimming in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Denver-based Qwest, with $26.6 billion in debt, is now
being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its
accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   The company has had steep declines in both its local and
long-distance businesses and faces a crisis of investor confidence in
the company and its leadership. Qwest's stock has fallen more than
92% since its high of $57.88 in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, Nacchio has come under criticism by investors and
analysts for the way he has managed Qwest and for cashing out more
than $300 million of his personal Qwest holdings even as the company
struggled and investors saw the value of their holdings plummet.</TE>
<TE>   Nacchio was informed of the board's decision to replace him Friday
night, according to the Journal.</TE>

<HD>It's Best to Outsource When Creating Company's Web Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer are a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Question: My fledgling firm has grown to the point where it makes
sense to start doing business over the Internet. I'd like to build a
Web site in-house because I feel that would give me more control over
the final product. However, I'm not sure I can afford to hire the
staff to build and maintain it. Should I outsource or bite the bullet
and bring people on board who can get the job done?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Unless you have a sophisticated in-house information
technology department that can dedicate the time and resources to
building your site, chances are you will find it much more efficient
and cost-effective to outsource.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Schulenburg, president of Master Designs in South
Barrington, Ill., believes that outsourcing offers additional
advantages that go beyond the underlying cost issues. First, the
Internet and the technologies that support it change daily. Unless
you build Web sites for a living, you may find it impossible to keep
up with trends and emerging technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Second, vendors provide faster time to market. A good vendor
working under closely supervised deadlines can get a Web site up and
running much faster than a company that's trying to take care of
customers and create an online presence at the same time. In
addition, experienced vendors can help you avoid costly mistakes
because they already know the pitfalls that can derail most Internet
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, outsourcing enables you to maintain a certain distance
from the project and take a much more strategic approach. It allows
you to remain focused on your primary business objectives while the
vendor worries about making the technology work.</TE>
<TE>   To outsource successfully, Schulenburg says, select your vendor
from among several bids. When researching vendor candidates:</TE>
<TE>   * Check references carefully. Browse several Web sites each vendor
has built, checking for functionality, ease of navigation, visual
impression and other key components of a good site. Talk with a
variety of the vendor's clients. Was the vendor easy to work with?
Did the vendor deliver as promised, on time and within budget? Does
the Web site do what it was designed to do?</TE>
<TE>   * Know the vendor's capabilities. Web design firms come in all
shapes and sizes. Look for someone who understands your business
goals and objectives and has the expertise to build a site that will
support them.</TE>
<TE>   * Check for cultural fit. Keep in mind that you will interact
regularly with this person or team for several months, so make sure
the vendor has a project management and communication style that you
can work with.</TE>
<TE>   * Demand transfer of knowledge. Once your site is up and running,
you shouldn't have to run to the vendor every time a minor change is
called for. Avoid vendors who can't or won't train someone on your
staff to update and maintain the site.</TE>
<TE>   * Choose your bid carefully. A "time and materials" contract
offers more flexibility, but once the vendor goes on the clock,
expenses can quickly get out of hand. In contrast, a fixed bid keeps
your costs in check but makes it harder to shift directions
midstream. Even minor changes to the plan can require a written
change order and additional fees.</TE>
<TE>   "A fixed bid will usually get you to market quicker," Schulenburg
notes, "but unless you give the vendor very clear guidelines, you may
end up with a Web site that doesn't meet expectations. On the other
hand, if you go with a time-and-materials bid, don't strive for the
perfect site or you will never get online. Instead, get your site up
and running as quickly as possible and then make any necessary
modifications as you get feedback from customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Either way, outsourcing should save you time and money compared
to doing it in-house. The key is to make sure your strategy drives
the technology and not the other way around. There's no point in
having a Web site if it doesn't support your long-term strategic
goals."</TE>

<HD>Chips Get Smaller and More Is Put on Them</HD>
<DH>Electronics: Placing a whole system on a single piece of
silicon improves devices' performance and lowers cost. The
integration trend shows no signs of slowing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW FORDAHL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three years ago, as many as 50 chips would have been needed to handle
the features built into Ericsson's new T66 cell phone. Today, four
slivers of silicon do the job.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the phone is among Ericsson's smallest and most
powerful, one of a generation of devices integrating functions that
used to require multiple gadgets.</LD>
<LD>   And the phone is on the market now--not stuck on the drawing
board.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a classic example of the system-on-a-chip approach," said
Lewis Chew, chief financial officer of National Semiconductor Corp.,
the Santa Clara-based company that supplied the chips. "We took all
the radio, digital processing, power management and the audio and put
it on the four chips."</TE>
<TE>   The semiconductor industry has always managed to squeeze more
features onto smaller pieces of silicon, but this integration is
leading to remarkable results.</TE>
<TE>   Complete systems now can be built on a piece as small as a match
head, allowing cell phones to act like palm-size computers and small
hand-held devices to work as phones.</TE>
<TE>   These systems-on-a-chip, which usually aren't advertised to
consumers, also are behind smaller set-top TV boxes that can handle
both video and Web surfing, powerful video game consoles and the
latest, Internet-capable video recorders.</TE>
<TE>   If an electronic device is faster, smaller and cheaper, it's
probably more integrated than previous generations.</TE>
<TE>   Though the semiconductor industry suffered its worst downturn ever
in 2001, this integration shows no signs of slowing.</TE>
<TE>   Intel Corp., for instance, is working on adding radio to every
chip it makes. This innovation could usher in an era of computing in
which all devices--from hand-helds to PCs--are seamlessly and always
connected.</TE>
<TE>   Wireless is but one of the features being integrated on individual
chips. Advanced power management, video encoding and audio processing
also are being added like so many Lego blocks.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just consumer electronics.</TE>
<TE>   IBM Corp.'s new Cu-08 technology, whose first customer is expected
to be networking giant Cisco Systems Inc., allows voltage to be
altered within individual chip components. This can reduce power by
supplying only the functions that are in use at any given moment.</TE>
<TE>   These advances are not limited to servers, routers, PCs and cell
phones. They're changing everything silicon touches, from car parts
to dishwashers to electronic doorknobs in hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the public doesn't realize it, but there have been far
more non-PC computer chips sold for the last several years than PC
chips," said Richard Doherty, director of research at the
Envisioneering Group.</TE>
<TE>   This improved performance is a simple matter of physics. In older
systems, the chip handling the computations sends data electrons to
memory chips or to other chips interacting with the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Integrating the functions shortens the electrons' travel distance.
That means faster performance on less power--whether it's an MP3
player or an Internet router. Having fewer chips also cuts costs and
allows companies to bring products to market more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   A general-purpose computer microprocessor, such as a Pentium from
Intel or an Athlon from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., takes years to
design, build and test. But consumer gadgets are designed in much
shorter cycles and often need to run only a single operating system.</TE>
<TE>   System-on-a-chip growth has bolstered semiconductor firms that
sell designs for processor cores that can be plunked into a die and
combined with other functions.</TE>
<TE>   Such companies, which include Britain's ARM Holdings and MIPS
Technologies, saw sales grow 25% last year to $892 million, according
to Gartner Dataquest.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, overall semiconductor sales fell nearly 32% in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Even processors no longer used in new PCs, such as Motorola Inc.'s
68000 model, have found new lives as cores.</TE>
<TE>   But building a single chip from disparate parts can be
tricky--both technically and legally.</TE>
<TE>   Testing equipment and validation techniques that work on
individual components don't necessarily translate once those pieces
are fused in a single piece of silicon, said Ann Harwood, engineering
manager for system-on-a-chip architecture for Motorola.</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge is combining analog and digital functions on a
single chip.</TE>
<TE>   For a chip to communicate with the real world, it must process the
many shades of analog information, not just the on-off language of
digital data.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like if you wanted to open up a cake shop and you
were great at making the batter but you didn't know how to do the
frosting," said National Semiconductor's Chew. "Well, you're hosed.
If you don't have analog technology in your own company, no one else
is going to give you that."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Gelsinger, Intel's chief technology officer, says his company
still faces technical hurdles in squeezing radios onto its
chips--something it aims to do within 10 years. For one thing, it
remains to be seen how the hardware might be upgraded without opening
holes for hackers.</TE>
<TE>   "Every step of the way, we can put more in," Gelsinger said. "But
we could also be putting the wrong thing in."</TE>

<HD>Flat-Screen LCD Monitors Offer Good Looks for a Price</HD>
<DH>Equipment: Although still more expensive than CRT displays,
the panels take up less room and are easier on the eyes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. IAN HOPPER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's one thing you never have enough of on your computer desk,
it's space.</LD>
<LD>   Thankfully, new flat-screen liquid-crystal display monitors are
dropping in price and take up much less real estate.</LD>
<LD>   A new monitor from Samsung Electronics Co. takes up a fraction of
the space of a typical cathode-ray tube display and has an added
bonus: It looks really cool.</LD>
<TE>   Take that, froufrou Mac users.</TE>
<TE>   The P in the 17-inch Samsung 171P monitor stands for Porsche. Yes,
that's Porsche. It's designed by the F.A. Porsche studio, the
original designer of the super-sleek Porsche 911 car.</TE>
<TE>   The $899 machine is a metal gray color, with flat touch-sensitive
controls and a streamlined base.</TE>
<TE>   You can lift it easily with one hand, and the screen rotates
vertically--or diagonally if you're in the mood.</TE>
<TE>   This makes it ideal for businesses using large spreadsheets or
looking at vertical Web pages. The special software included with the
monitor reformats the page vertically.</TE>
<TE>   This is my first LCD monitor, so I was skeptical. Would the
refresh rate be good enough for fast-moving graphics such as those in
3-D games? Can you see the screen from an angle?</TE>
<TE>   Yes on both counts. Using either an analog or a digital plug in
your video card, the display is extremely crisp and can show
resolutions about four times better than what most 17-inch-monitor
users are accustomed to.</TE>
<TE>   And, since LCDs don't flicker like the CRTs, they're easier on the
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   There are some other differences. Unlike some older CRT monitors,
LCDs aren't susceptible to burn-in. So a screen saver is unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   LCDs do suffer from a minor glitch. When I changed the screen
resolution to enlarge the text for more comfortable reading, I
noticed that about every third line of text had an extremely slight
blur. It was just enough to notice.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Samsung engineer, that's because LCD
monitors--unlike CRTs--have specific "native modes." Think of them as
default resolutions for the monitor.</TE>
<TE>   If you switch out of one of those modes, the monitor has to add
data to fill the entire screen. That added data is never as good as
the original data, hence the blur.</TE>
<TE>   We also tested flat-panel competitors from IBM Corp. and Sharp
Corp., as well as a second Samsung LCD.</TE>
<TE>   The IBM T560, a 15-inch LCD that sells for $650, has a screen
pivot function similar to the Samsung 171P's, with software that
flips your work to match the screen's orientation.</TE>
<TE>   The rich images on the high-end screen survive steep viewing
angles, a feature that some of the cheaper LCDs lack.</TE>
<TE>   For about $200 less, Samsung, NEC Corp. and others also sell
15-inch flat panels.</TE>
<TE>   A low-priced Samsung model that we tested, the SyncMaster 570V,
was significantly less viewable at angles than the IBM screen but
functioned well otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   On the high end, the 18-inch Sharp LL-T1820 was astoundingly
bright, clear and glare-resistant. Sharp says this $1,300 monitor is
able to produce more than 1 billion colors because it varies the
intensity of red, blue and green subpixels.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp touts the LL-T1820 as an attractive option for people who do
medical and photo imaging, giving them the ability to flip the screen
vertically and line up two or three screens side by side.</TE>
<TE>   Even those of us with just one screen will see more with an LCD
monitor as opposed to a CRT of the same size. A typical 17-inch CRT
monitor has a viewable size--usually written in small text in an
ad--of about 15 inches. However, a 17-inch LCD monitor really is 17
inches, and you'll see every bit.</TE>
<TE>   LCDs have another upside.</TE>
<TE>   A CRT monitor shows a picture by creating light, shooting energy
from its electron gun against the colored pixels near the monitor
glass.</TE>
<TE>   An LCD monitor works by blocking light. Your monitor uses about
80% of the electricity in a typical computer setup, so you'll end up
saving money on your bill.</TE>
<TE>   But you'll have to invest more. A low-end 15-inch CRT costs $99
and a 17-inch runs $150.</TE>
<TE>   Typical 17-inch LCD monitors cost about $550 to $700, but 15-inch
LCDs sell for less than $400.</TE>
<TE>   In this respect, monitors aren't much different from cars or
sneakers. You pay more for good looks.</TE>

<HD>Winnick Firm Seeks Payment from Global</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Claim for $500,000 in rent comes from an entity
that is controlled by the CEO of the telecom company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A company controlled by Gary Winnick is demanding $500,000 in overdue
rent from Global Crossing Ltd., the telecommunications company
Winnick founded and helped run and now is in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   The request for payment from North Crescent Realty V is just one
of many in Global Crossing's bankruptcy filings and is standard
procedure in many respects. But with both companies effectively owned
by Winnick, the rent claim represents a strange twist and further
evidence of Global Crossing's tangled relationships with companies
that have close ties to the firm or its executives.</LD>
<LD>   "What we have basically is Gary Winnick going after Gary Winnick,"
said Michael Nighan, one of hundreds of former Global Crossing
employees fighting for payment of canceled severance and unpaid
business expenses. "He's brought chutzpah into the data age."</LD>
<TE>   Howard J. Rubenstein, spokesman for Winnick, characterized the
payment claim as necessary paperwork for anyone owed money by Global
Crossing for services after its Jan. 28 filing for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</TE>
<TE>   The rent claim involves Global Crossing's Beverly Hills offices,
which were leased from North Crescent Realty. North Crescent is
managed by Pacific Capital Group, Winnick's privately owned
investment company.</TE>
<TE>   In paperwork filed Friday, North Crescent says it has received
only partial payment of rent owed for February, March and April and
is owed nearly $500,000. Under general bankruptcy rules, Global
Crossing is expected to pay "reasonable" bills for its daily
operations while in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing won court approval to cancel its lease with North
Crescent as of April 2, and the company moved out of the luxurious
offices in mid-April. Global Crossing officials believe North
Crescent incorrectly applied nearly $280,000 of its available
security deposit to pre-bankruptcy costs instead of to the current
rent bill and that the outstanding rent totals about $220,000.</TE>
<TE>   Under its 1999 lease with North Crescent, Global Crossing paid
about $400,000 a month in rent to use 86,740 square feet of space in
the historic Beverly Hills office building, at 360 N. Crescent Drive.
North Crescent said in its filing that Global Crossing's accrued and
unpaid interest on the past-due rent totaled $36,338.55 through April
30, an amount that is increasing by $84.40 each day.</TE>

<HD>Perrun Virus Is First to Infect Picture Files</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new virus threatens to strike one of the Internet's most common and
useful activities: sharing family photos.</LD>
<LD>   The malicious program, the first to infect picture files, is not
attacking computers. Called Perrun, it worries researchers because it
is the first to be able to cross from infecting a program to
infecting data files, long considered safe from such threats.</LD>
<LD>   "Our concern is more for what might be coming," said Vincent
Gullotto, head anti-virus researcher at McAfee.com Corp., which
produces top-selling anti-virus software. "Potentially no file type
could be safe."</LD>
<TE>   As with any computer threat, the best way to protect a computer is
to have updated anti-virus software.</TE>
<TE>   McAfee researchers received the virus from its creator. Virus
writers typically send their new work to researchers--as well as
fellow virus writers--as a way of bragging about their skills.
Gullotto declined to identify the author.</TE>
<TE>   McAfee said its anti-virus software can detect and remove Perrun.</TE>
<TE>   Perrun is known as a proof-of-concept virus and does not cause
damage. But Gullotto said he fears other virus writers may use Perrun
as a template to create a more destructive version.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, viruses infected program files--files that can be run
on their own. Data files, such as movies, music, text and pictures,
were safe from infection. Though earlier viruses deleted or modified
data files, Perrun is the first to infect them.</TE>
<TE>   Perrun inserts portions of the virus code into the picture file.
When the picture is viewed, it can infect other pictures. If the
author wished, the virus could delete files on the computer or
perform other mischief.</TE>
<TE>   The virus would need modifications to become dangerous, because it
arrives as a program file that can be attached to an e-mail. Security
experts always warn against opening programs sent as e-mail
attachments.</TE>
<TE>   Once run, the file installs a program onto the victim's hard drive
that can infect pictures. When a computer user clicks on a picture
file with the extension .jpg--a common picture file found on the
Web--the picture is infected before it appears. Because the picture
displays normally, Gullotto said, the victim may not know there's
anything wrong.</TE>

<HD>New NBC Shows Can Be Previewed on PDAs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC has found a novel way to promote its fall lineup for the small
screen--by previewing its new prime-time shows on the very, very
small screen.</LD>
<LD>   The General Electric Co.-owned broadcaster has teamed up with San
Francisco-based multimedia software company Mazingo Network Inc. to
feed video clips of five new NBC shows directly to hand-held computer
devices.</LD>
<LD>   NBC said it represents the first time that a major television
network can easily deliver video directly to mobile users around the
world.</LD>
<TE>   Under the deal, Pocket PC and Palm Inc. users who download free
Mazingo software from the company's Web site at www.mazingo .net can
view three-minute audio-video clips of the five new TV series NBC
plans to launch this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The clips package includes three new comedies--"In-Laws," "Hidden
Hills" and "Good Morning Miami"--and two new dramas--the nostalgic
family series "American Dreams" and the ensemble crime hour
"Boomtown."</TE>
<TE>   Mazingo, which was launched in October, offers subscription
packages of video and multimedia content for viewing on personal
digital assistants.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the privately held company said its service has
50,000 users worldwide, about half of them abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Mazingo touts itself as being the first company to develop a
copy-protection system for video content on PDAs.</TE>
<TE>   Mazingo said it plans to announce new deals this week with USA
Today, which will provide text headlines and daily video newscasts,
and with Weather Channel Inc. for local and international forecasting
services.</TE>
<TE>   The NBC deal marks the latest in a recent string of ventures by
entertainment companies to extend their content and brand into the
wireless communications arena.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. reached a series of agreements with wireless
companies to provide logos, text cards and ring tones based on Disney
characters to mobile phone users in Asia and is seeking similar pacts
with U.S. wireless carriers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They are shooting down Cabinet members. Infiltrating the White House.
Disintegrating Congress. They have been found in possession of the
most toxic biochemical arsenals known to man, and they maintain an
alarmingly fanatical following.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorists? No, but probably the second-greatest threat facing the
nation today: Aging rock stars.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, whose recent African
tour--which was all but guaranteed prime media coverage with its
glitzy trifecta of AIDS, the Third World and the Treasury
Department--was upstaged by the presence of 42-year-old U2 lead
singer Bono.</LD>
<TE>   Ask aides to President Bush, who saw the usual dignity of the
White House correspondents' dinner sullied with the presence of
53-year-old Ozzy Osbourne. Don't even get them started on how bad
Osbourne made Bush look by having offspring comparatively healthier
than the president's.</TE>
<TE>   Or ask Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio), who was prompted this month
to boycott congressional testimony on the environment by 30-year-old
Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson. (In boy-band years, that's over the
hill twice.)</TE>
<TE>   Every day, thousands of potential future "classic rockers" enter
the U.S. from rock-sponsoring nations like Britain, Canada and
Sweden. Yet it takes decades of declining album sales for them to
even get on the radar screen of the national agency explicitly
devoted to monitoring them: VH-1.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling is the silence of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, whose
religious disdain for dancing ought to ally him with the Kenny
Loggins-hating town elders from the movie "Footloose." Instead,
Ashcroft insists that the 2nd Amendment protects the rights of
individuals to bear even leathery, tattoo-encrusted arms. He also
refuses to document the drug prescription records of countless
foreign has-beens touring here on temporary visas.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is this just a U.S. problem.</TE>
<TE>   Mick Jagger came within striking distance of the queen of England
with a sharp blade when he was knighted last week.</TE>
<TE>   And tensions are flaring in Ireland, no doubt over last week's
removal of Paul McCartney from the dating market.</TE>
<TE>   Asia, meanwhile, is on the brink of nuclear war over a territory
named after a 1970s Led Zeppelin song. The question is, how trashed
will we let the national motel room get before we tell these
immune-system-compromised legends that the party is truly over?</TE>
<TE>   How long before our energy-strapped country is diverting billions
of megawatts into Keith Richards' dialysis? Before the
incomprehensible Bob Dylan is recruited to be a "code talker" for our
enemies overseas? Before newsstands carrying Gene Simmons' Tongue
(the new magazine developed by the Israeli-born singer for the rock
band Kiss) are jointly firebombed by pro-Palestinian activists and
loyalist readers of Maxim?</TE>
<TE>   Be forewarned: Osbourne already has staked his territorial marking
on the Alamo. Even if he doesn't remember it.</TE>

<HD>Killing Hussein Is Too Extreme</HD>
<DH>He has got to go, but not by a U.S. assassin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNEST W. LEFEVER</AU>
<BD>Ernest W. Lefever is a senior fellow at the Ethics and
Public Policy Center in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush has repeatedly asserted that Iraq's Saddam Hussein
must be "removed, by force if necessary." Many options short of
invasion are being debated in Washington and the media, with one
intriguing exception.</LD>
<LD>   In all the buzz there has been precious little talk about what was
once considered, at least in some quarters, the most efficient and
surgical way to deal with a brutal and predatory tyrant. Now,
however, this sensitive matter is greeted with an uncommon
squeamishness.</LD>
<LD>   After the abrupt end of the Persian Gulf War, which unfortunately
left Hussein in power, some Washington insiders openly called for
dealing with him "with extreme prejudice," a euphemism for
assassination in the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   George Bernard Shaw once called assassination "an extreme form of
censorship." Indeed it is, but would it be an effective and
justifiable way to clear the way for a more responsible regime in
Baghdad?</TE>
<TE>   Virtually everyone in the West and many Middle Eastern leaders
would be happy to see Hussein disappear. He has used chemical weapons
against his own people, overrun Kuwait and threatened Saudi oil
fields. If one believes in justifiable tyrannicide, certainly Hussein
qualifies.</TE>
<TE>   Yet killing a hated and dangerous tyrant raises troubling moral,
political and tactical questions. Should we resort to it?</TE>
<TE>   The severe tactical and political limits of assassination, even
when the moral issue seems clear, are underscored by the failure to
eliminate the 20th century's most brutal tyrants--Adolf Hitler,
Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-tung.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to our hemisphere, President Kennedy, chafing under the
Bay of Pigs disaster in Cuba, was determined to eliminate Fidel
Castro. His efforts failed, and a brazen Castro is still in power.</TE>
<TE>   JFK's misadventure and congressional criticism of CIA covert
action abroad eventually led to President Ford's executive order
banning any direct U.S. efforts to assassinate a foreign leader. But
this vague ban has not closed the book on a vexing issue.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Lincoln, himself the tragic victim of an assassin's
bullet, offered some cautionary advice. Invoking the American
Revolution, he asserted the right of any people to overthrow a
tyrannical regime by violent means, including, by inference, the
assassination of its leader. But he also warned that "it is the duty
of our government to neither foment, nor assist, such revolutions in
other governments."</TE>
<TE>   His views on permissible tyrannicide stem from the Judeo-Christian
"just war" doctrine that supports the use of lethal force against
evil men but requires a just intention, appropriate tactics and the
reasonable prospect for a just outcome. Just consequences is the most
difficult test because of multiple factors in all human events.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. policymakers and the exile opposition groups seeking to
eliminate Hussein hope that a reasonably free Iraq will emerge, one
permitting relative autonomy to the Kurds in the north and the
Shiites in the south. But a violent end for Hussein may yield a
fragmented state, with factions squabbling over a share of benefits
from Iraqi oil. And the U.S. would hardly be willing to provide a
large occupation force to stabilize the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi people deserve a humane regime, and the world would be
less dangerous without Hussein. Theoretically, assassination may be a
timely and just answer. Yet, as Lincoln insisted, the deadly deed
should be done by the people who have suffered most--in this case,
the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, history and ethics suggest that Washington
should not be directly involved in eliminating Hussein "with extreme
prejudice." The Iraqis must liberate themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we should continue our current political, economic and
military policies designed to hobble, if not defang, Baghdad's
capacity to do further mischief.</TE>

<LD>While the nation's attention is focused on terrorism, the Middle East
and South Asia, an equally significant danger has been growing in
East Asia. The Bush administration is intensifying U.S. political and
military ties with Taiwan in ways that could increase the chances of
a confrontation with mainland China.</LD>
<LD>   Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian visited the U.S. twice last year
for extended "transit stops" and held unofficial meetings with
American politicians. Senior Taiwanese Cabinet officials have
traveled to U.S. cities as well. Equally notable, Taiwan gets
unprecedented amounts of U.S. military aid, including an increasing
number of sophisticated weapons and other support, such as
intelligence and reconnaissance data links.</LD>
<LD>   Although some of this began during the Clinton era, it has
expanded greatly since President Bush took office. Administration
officials insist that more U.S. support is necessary to deter a
potential Chinese attack on Taiwan, something Washington is pledged
to prevent. They also argue that a more confident Taipei enjoying
stronger U.S. support and supposedly under greater U.S. control will
be less inclined--and less able--to move toward independence or to
end-run the administration with appeals to Congress, as occurred
during the Clinton presidency.</LD>
<TE>   Reducing the chances of a dangerous miscalculation by China while
preventing destabilizing actions by Taiwan should be at the core of
any U.S. policy. But the one-sided Bush approach instead signals to
Taipei and Beijing that the U.S. will probably tolerate and might
encourage any movement toward independence short of the most obvious,
such as a formal declaration. It also signals that the U.S. will
defend Taiwan if China responds to such movement with a show of
force.</TE>
<TE>   This approach is dangerous for several reasons:</TE>
<TE>   * The administration does not know where all of Beijing's internal
lines in the sand lie; indeed, the Chinese themselves may not know
this. China's leaders fear that incremental movement by the U.S. and
Taiwan toward closer ties and what they see as a more permanent
independent status for Taipei will build an unstoppable momentum.
Beijing could feel compelled to act militarily before such momentum
develops. And that could happen no matter how strong Taiwan is
militarily.</TE>
<TE>   * One cannot assume that Chen will resist crossing Beijing's
less-obvious internal lines, whether for domestic political reasons
or out of a search for independence. In fact, he seems to be pressing
for a formal invitation to Washington, presumably to guarantee his
reelection in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   * Chen is supporting a variety of efforts to discredit the
"one-China" concept domestically. The Bush administration does not
discourage any of these actions, which are viewed as highly
provocative by Beijing. The tolerant Bush approach toward Taipei
indirectly encourages pro-Taiwan members of Congress to undermine the
one-China concept and to move even closer to Taiwan, thereby creating
even greater separation from the mainland. There is growing support
on Capitol Hill for a Chen visit as well as for joint military
operations between the U.S. and Taiwan, another likely provocation
for Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese thus far have avoided reacting more aggressively to
the Bush policy line because of domestic distractions, a desire to
avoid damaging the improving U.S.-China relationship and a sense of
growing influence over Taiwan resulting from Taiwan's increasing
economic dependence. But these restraints could decline. And even if
they do not, they are not a guarantee that Beijing will not take
action.</TE>
<TE>   Absent more credible efforts to reassure China by restraining
Taiwan and correcting its pro-Taipei policy, the Bush administration
may ensure rather than deter a future conflict with China.</TE>

<LD>Many of the 390 elementary and middle school students who attend the
Bellagio Road Newcomer Center in Bel-Air fled war-torn countries in
Africa, were uprooted from Korea or ventured through Latin America to
reach the United States. The culture of Los Angeles was foreign to
them when they arrived. Most spoke little English. In other words,
they are like most of the other 10,000 immigrant children who enter
the L.A. Unified School District each year--which is why the
financially strapped district made the right choice in deciding to
end the Bellagio program.</LD>
<LD>   The district buses the students to the tree-shaded oasis from
Pico-Union, the Eastside and other neighborhoods many miles away.
Transporting them costs more than half a million dollars a year, a
luxury in an economic climate dominated by bone-deep budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   What is prudent financially is not always prudent educationally.
But subdistrict Supt. Richard Alonzo made a persuasive case to the
Los Angeles Board of Education that Bellagio's students can get the
support they need at their home schools because they also are full of
new arrivals.</LD>
<TE>   Those services were not as available throughout the district 12
years ago when the special immigrant program opened. In 1989,
grouping together older immigrant students from different countries
was considered innovative. They could struggle with the difficulties
of learning a new language and a new way of life during their first
year in the United States without the stigma of being a foreigner.</TE>
<TE>   Today, especially after 9/11, parents want to keep their children
close to home, according to a district survey. Many immigrant parents
also want their children to learn English as soon as possible. They
prefer immersion classes, which start lessons in English on the first
day of school. This approach became standard after 1998, when
Proposition 227 eliminated most bilingual instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Bellagio's students will feel at home on many campuses because
children from more than 100 countries attend public schools in Los
Angeles. The majority of children who start school in the LAUSD,
including many born in Los Angeles, do not speak English. They all
should get what they need. That will require sacrificing programs
that serve a few students for the benefit of several hundred thousand
children.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the many hard-working immigrants who will receive
awards and scholarships at graduation ceremonies districtwide this
month offer clear evidence that academic success is within every
student's reach.</TE>

<LD>Large financial institutions acquire smaller competitors to improve
their bottom lines, not, as the glitzy advertising suggests, out of a
neighborly desire to make life better for consumers. Though economies
of scale theoretically could generate lower fees for consumers, one
sure result of Citigroup's proposed $5.8-billion takeover of
California Federal Bank's parent company would be fewer choices for
people who need a home loan, a convenient cashier window or other
financial services.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators are unlikely to stop the nation's largest
financial institution from acquiring Cal Fed, the nation's
third-largest savings and loan. But the Federal Reserve Board should
at least investigate community activists' claims that Citigroup has
done relatively little in other states to help consumers in
low-income neighborhoods that traditionally get shortchanged on
banking services.</LD>
<TE>   Activists use phrases like "pervasive anti-consumer practices" to
describe Citigroup's involvement in needier neighborhoods. Citigroup
sparked concern two years ago with its $30-billion purchase of
Associates First Capital, the nation's largest sub-prime lender (a
company that charges higher interest rates to make riskier loans).
The Federal Trade Commission is seeking hundreds of millions of
dollars on behalf of consumers with poor or limited credit histories
who allegedly paid exorbitant fees for mortgages with Associates
First Capital before Citigroup's acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup maintains that it has fixed the problems at Associates
First Capital. Regulators, though, should review Citigroup's
community reinvestment efforts, which are required by federal law.
The proposed acquisition would continue a string of deals in which
California institutions--including Wells Fargo, Home Savings of
America, Bank of America and Glendale Federal--have been gobbled up.
Consumer groups worry that the Citigroup subsidiary Citibank, owner
of Mexico's second-largest bank, would increase wire-transfer fees
charged to Mexican Americans sending money back to relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Fed's 352 branches, mainly in California, would triple
Citigroup's presence here. Citigroup hopes to use that larger
presence to pitch its Travelers insurance arm, Primerica financial
services unit and Salomon Smith Barney investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Other big banks have set down in writing what they intend to do on
the community reinvestment front. Bank of America and Washington
Mutual have made multiyear pledges totaling $725 billion for
single-family home loans in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods
around the country. Citigroup should be willing to spell out exactly
how it would use its newfound market muscle to improve financial
services for some of the state's poorer areas.</TE>

<LD>Prescription drug costs increasingly are socking it to employers,
government and most of all, patients. U.S. prescription drug spending
has doubled since 1997 to $154 billion last year, and more than
one-quarter of the 40 million Americans on Medicare have no drug
coverage whatsoever. The choice is too often between the rent and the
heart medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats and Republicans each have a proposed drug benefit for
Medicare recipients. Yet instead of compromise, expect mud-slinging
in this election year. The only bright spot is off in a legislative
corner--a bill that would help speed generic drugs to market.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday, the chairman of
the Senate Health Committee, Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), will begin
stumping for a drug benefit bill he co-authored with Sens. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.) and Zell Miller (D-Ga.). With a $25 monthly premium,
Medicare recipients could buy generic drugs for a $10 co-payment and
brand-name drugs for a $40 co-payment. The measure would cost $500
billion over 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy will certainly compare his bill to the rival GOP benefit
that Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield) plans to make public this
week. In recent drafts of that bill, Thomas kept costs under $350
billion over a decade by charging a $34 monthly premium and requiring
patients to eat 20% to 50% of a drug's cost.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas has sincerely tried for years to control drug costs, and he
deserves credit for it.</TE>
<TE>   What's troubling about the Thomas bill is not its frugality but
its fast-and-loose rules. Kennedy would have regional buying groups,
like those used by large employers, negotiate discounted prices for a
list of the most necessary and effective drugs as defined by Medicare
officials. In contrast, Thomas would give control to private health
insurers, who could bypass Medicare standards and lists of approved
drugs. Just as Medicare HMOs are pulling out of areas where they
attract too many ill senior citizens, insurers would be free to avoid
offering a drug benefit in certain regions. Or a plan might offer
nothing but discount cards for medications made by companies with
financial ties to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's bill may be the better starting point, but it would
never get past President Bush's desk--even if the House were to
accept it. As Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the Hudson
Institute, a conservative think tank, points out, "The [federal] tax
cut pretty much depleted the cupboard as far as paying for a generous
prescription drug plan." Senate Democrats are dead set against a
privately run plan like Thomas'.</TE>
<TE>   What Kennedy could realistically accomplish is a prompt vote on a
more modest and politically viable bill by Sens. Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). That measure would bar
pharmaceutical giants from filing frivolous demands for patent
extensions on brand-name drugs just to keep generic drugs off the
market. The Schumer-McCain bill admittedly is far short of reforming
Medicare, but it's probably the only prescription drug assistance
voters can expect from legislators this year.</TE>

<LD>"Palestinians in Gaza Have Roadblock Rage" (June 13) claims that
"endless waits at checkpoints" have created "mass misery for
Palestinians." This isn't mass misery. Mass misery is collecting
children's body parts from a playground or supermarket. Mass misery
is being stalked by teenage predators lusting for your nation's
blood.</LD>
<LD>   It's a testament to the Israeli army's enlightened outlook that,
after 21 months of Palestinian atrocities against Israelis, the media
have no greater Israeli atrocities against Palestinians to report
than long waits at checkpoints. Few other nations would show so much
self-restraint and respect for a ruthless enemy's human rights as the
Israelis do.</LD>
<LD>   As for the Palestinian noncombatants who are made to wait at
roadblocks, the solution is in their hands. Boot Yasser Arafat. End
the intifada. Make peace today.</LD>

<TE>   It is ironic that Frida Ghitis would point the finger at
Palestinians and say their definition of a Palestinian state includes
all of Israel ("Fuzzy Geography of the Mideast," Commentary, June
13). The stated policy of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's own
party is that there will never be a Palestinian state on the West
Bank--which is to say, the eastern border of Israel is the Jordan
River. No other nation agrees with that position.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for the U.S. to take the lead in getting Israel (to
which we give $3 billion a year) and the Palestinians to agree to an
interim Palestinian state on the West Bank so that these two parties
can negotiate as state to state, to the benefit of all concerned,
including the U.S.</TE>

<LD>I doubt that the writer of the romantic essay, "These Earthly
Infernos" (editorial, June 13), has ever cut hand line in a wildfire.
I was a wild-land firefighter, a.k.a. "smoke-eater," in August 2000.
My colleagues on my first crew were foulmouthed jailbirds with
swastika tattoos who spent most of the night shift sleeping beside a
burning stump. The second crew I was on spent a week lazing on an
airfield in Oregon, minus one night in a hotel with cable TV and hot
tub, waiting for a fire while "the West burned."</LD>
<LD>   When we finally got our big fire, I realized that the main purpose
of our task had been the protection of lumber profits and a few
summer cabins. We know that wildfire is part of the ecological order,
yet in 2000 we spent $1 billion trying to control nature.</LD>
<LD>   Victory in wildfire suppression is temporary; the fuels that don't
burn this year may burn even hotter next year. Indeed, the summer of
2002 is already looking like an inferno, and the cliches comparing
firefighters to soldiers and wildfire suppression to war are in print
yet again.</LD>
<TE>   Like soldiers, wild-land firefighters risk their lives in awful
conditions to accomplish an ultimately impossible goal. Like war, the
wildfire suppression business is a bloated industry whose main goal
is to perpetuate its own necessity. Perhaps it's time to consider the
reality these summer blazes present us in less purple and ponderous
terms.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Call for Segregating Truck Traffic," June 6: So Congress
considers building a separate roadway system for (really big) big
rigs to haul freight. Great idea. It's wonderful to have some fresh
thinking on transportation.</LD>
<LD>   Let's optimize this proposed system. First, to move the freight
quickly, give these truck roads the right of way. That is, all other
traffic stops to allow the freight to go unimpeded. Second, to
conserve energy, use steel wheels on steel roads. That way, the truck
road system also emits as little diesel exhaust as possible. Third,
let's optimize the dispatching of the freight, so that all loads
going to the same location go together. Finally, let's give this new
system a catchy name. How does "railroad" sound?</LD>

<LD>Thanks so much for "Records Outline Simon's Role at Collapsed S&amp;L"
(June 13), on Republican candidate for governor Bill Simon Jr.'s
business experience. Up until now he hasn't exactly stated what his
philosophy of government is, but this article shows a little better
what it might be. According to Simon, when the government regulates
greedy or incompetent companies, it is acting inappropriately. But
when it bails out greedy or incompetent companies that have failed,
it is fulfilling the highest and best function of a government.</LD>
<LD>   In this philosophy, taxpayers should not be protected from greedy
or incompetent companies but they are definitely required to bail
those companies out when they fall apart. As a taxpayer rather than a
business owner, I guess I see things a little differently. But at
least now we know where Bill Simon stands.</LD>

<TE>   After the number The Times did on Simon and his failed S&amp;L, he
hasn't much chance of becoming governor. Your article reinforced the
ads that Gov. Gray Davis is running. Many people are not too happy
with Davis, but what choice do they have?</TE>
<TE>   I would like to offer a solution. We have just had a mayoral
election here in Long Beach. There was only one candidate on the
ballot, but he lost because of write-in votes. I believe that the
only person who could defeat Davis is Richard Riordan. He could
launch a write-in campaign that would be successful. Since Simon has
no chance of winning, it would help if Simon withdrew from the race.
But all should be cautioned not to hold their breath. Alas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Angry Residents Sink Police Chief's Surf Cam," June 7: Several
years ago, as San Diego's lifeguard chief, I proposed state
legislation entitled the California Open Waves Act, which was
intended to reduce surfer localism. Localism refers to the protection
of local surf spots through violence and intimidation. There have
been many examples over the years that have included very serious
assaults. The proposed act declares that "the ocean along
California's coastline and the waves which strike it are an
invaluable asset which is owned by no person and available for equal
use by all." Common sense, one would think.</LD>
<TE>   I was not surprised when the proposal met opposition from those
who practice localism. I was surprised, though, to encounter
opposition from other--seemingly responsible--surfers. The reason, I
came to understand, is that some who do not openly practice localism
nevertheless perceive a benefit from its existence. Namely, there is
less congestion at their local surf spot. Lunada Bay in Palos Verdes
is infamous for localism. Nevertheless, local officials recently
knuckled under to the desires of local surfers to protect their turf.
So it was when the Open Waves Act was proposed, and so it is today.
As Shawn Collins (president of Surf- line, whose video cameras
monitor activity on local beaches) rued, "Localism works." It will
continue to work until and unless someone puts a stop to it.</TE>

<LD>Steve Lopez's June 12 column about young Aurelio Marquez, and his
determination to succeed in his dreams of an education at an Ivy
League university, was a magnificent piece of journalism. Our
12-year-old grandson has those same dreams to go to the University of
Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   He and his 10-year-old sister have been attending a Catholic
school, both to enrich their faith in family and because it offers an
outstanding educational opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   Our prayers are that they will succeed as did young Aurelio. How
very proud his family must be.</LD>

<LD>I really do not understand the LAUSD's rationale for trying to
improve the quality of education ("L.A. Unified Cuts $31 Million
More," June 12). The school board justifies the high salaries to
administrators by saying it needs to attract the best qualified. But
in terms of teachers it is not willing to pay the same price. Now The
Times reports that the board will review possible cuts to rewards for
National Board Certified teachers.</LD>
<LD>   As a prospective NBC candidate I will think twice before investing
a couple of thousand dollars in the yearlong process. How does the
board expect to hire and retain the best and brightest teachers if it
is not willing to pay for them? Money is being spent on frivolous
administrative expenses. Recently, District H sent leadership teams
from the Roosevelt cluster to a three-day retreat, hotel room
included. Our school was left without anyone in charge. Parents were
livid.</LD>
<LD>   The LAUSD will never rise up from its mediocrity until it realizes
that teachers have the greatest impact on students.</LD>

<TE>   Re "L.A. Schools Pressured to Add 17 Days," June 11: It is
reported that one of the alternatives being considered by the LAUSD
for dealing with its overcrowded campuses is "running double sessions
on the same day. The school day would be split in two."</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years ago this fall, the population of the San Fernando
Valley was increasing so rapidly that Van Nuys Junior High School had
to go on double session. I was a member of the eighth-grade class and
still have the Oct. 14, 1952, issue of the Mustang, the school
newspaper, in which it was reported that "because of so many students
the B-8s have had to go on an extended schedule. Of course all of you
are aware of this because it has thrown the regular schedule somewhat
out of whack."</TE>
<TE>   The school operated on a nine-period day, with the seventh and
ninth grades in session Periods 1-6. We eighth-graders had five
classes rather than six, started our school day with Period 5 at
about 11 a.m. and ended with Period 9 at about 4:30 p.m. From the
perspective of a 12-year-old, this was an exciting new adventure, one
that I have never forgotten. I wonder what The Times will be
reporting about the classroom situation in 2052.</TE>

<LD>Your June 6 editorial, "Aid to Africa Can't Wait," quoted Mathabo
Lekoatsa, wife of a Lesothan tribal leader, saying, "Talk, talk,
talk. We hear a lot of words, but where is the food?" Prior to that
tiny mountain kingdom's elections in May, the government petitioned
the world community for $20 million for food to prevent the
starvation of its population of 2 million people.</LD>
<LD>   My religious congregation, the Sisters of the Holy Names, has
worked among the Basotho people since 1931. All of our 85 members in
Lesotho are Basotho women. During the months that I lived with them
in 2000, these women told me that as long as the Basotho villagers
could plant and harvest the corn, which cooked with water becomes
papa, the staple food, no one would starve.</LD>
<LD>   The Basotho crops have been ruined by a year of drought followed
by unseasonal rains. The Basotho people face starvation if sufficient
food aid is not sent immediately. Let us hope that the World Food
Summit in Rome produces more food for Africa than "talk, talk, talk."</LD>

<LD>As FBI agents sought clues at the site of a deadly car bombing
outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, another victim died.</LD>
<LD>   The death toll from Friday's bombing rose to 12 after an injured
constable who was guarding the consulate, Ubaid Ullah, succumbed, a
doctor said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they were taking seriously a claim of responsibility
from a previously unknown group called Al Qanoon, or the Law. The
group said in a fax to the newspaper Umat that if President Pervez
Musharraf didn't resign, there would be more attacks.</LD>

<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>The United States has deported an Egyptian man convicted in absentia
for involvement in the assassination of President Anwar Sadat by
Islamic militants, the U.S. Embassy said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It said Nabil Soliman, who had been in the U.S. since 1992, was
handed over to Egypt on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "This action follows the conclusion of appropriate legal
proceedings concerning Mr. Soliman, who was removed for being in the
United States illegally," the embassy statement said.</LD>
<TE>   The extradition "is another example of the close U.S.-Egyptian
cooperation in the war on terror, demonstrating the American
commitment to working closely with our friends and allies to
eradicate this scourge," the statement quoted Ambassador C. David
Welch as saying.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from the Interior Ministry of
Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Sadat was killed by Islamic radicals at a military parade in 1981.
Hundreds were tried for planning the assassination, the insurrection
that followed it and membership in the group that carried them out.</TE>
<TE>   Islamist figures in Cairo and London said they were not aware of
anyone by the name of Nabil Soliman being among the estimated 300 men
tried after Sadat's assassination.</TE>

<HD>Israel Gives In to Fence</HD>
<DH>Middle East: Fear of Palestinian attacks drives leaders to
begin walling off the West Bank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALIT, West Bank</DL>
<LD>In the spring winds, they are tangled together: The strains of the
Jewish teenagers' Pink Floyd, floating over the chlorinated waters of
the swimming pool. The Palestinian call to prayer. And the gunfire
that rumbles between the two.</LD>
<LD>   This is where Israel meets the West Bank, one of many unlikely
battle zones in a claustrophobic land that reinvents itself from one
hill to the next. This peak is a cozy cluster of basketball hoops,
red-tiled roofs and gaudy flower beds. On the next hill, past the
barbed wire and a scrubby stretch of no man's land, a Palestinian
village rises in concrete-block homes and a mosque's minaret.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a dangerous, very tense area. There's shooting all the
time," said Amir Aloni, the pistol-packing security chief of Salit,
glowering behind his sunglasses. "We have hostile neighbors."</LD>
<TE>   Pressed against--or, if you ask the Palestinians, imposed
upon--the edge of the Palestinian territories, this sleepy Jewish
settlement is wrapped in guard posts and floodlights. A few weeks
ago, the Israeli army cut a trench in the red earth at the foot of
the hill to block unwanted cars from climbing toward Salit.</TE>
<TE>   Those barricades are only the beginning. This spring, Israel is
doing something it has long avoided: building a wall between itself
and the swath of desert, orchard and hills known as the West Bank.
Barbed wire and motion detectors, concrete barricades and razor wire
are sprouting steadily over the rough ribbon of land.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, bulldozers flattened the dirt along the northern Israel
frontier to make way for the snaking wall. Soon, Israeli officials
have said, the whole West Bank will be walled off.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon--who scorned the notion of
a fence until the recent spate of bloody Palestinian attacks on
Israelis--changed his mind, and approved a plan drafted by Israeli
Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.</TE>
<TE>   The first posts were sunk into the fertile countryside near
Megiddo, where 17 Israeli bus passengers were killed this month by a
bomb set off by a young Palestinian militant. The construction
represents a major shift in mainstream Israeli thought, which for
decades bristled at creating anything that could resemble a border.
Even as the fence begins to rise, radical Israeli coalition members
are threatening to bring the government to a halt if the construction
continues.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides, meanwhile, are asking what Israel, in the words of the
Robert Frost poem, is "walling in or walling out." Palestinians
believe the fence will strip them of jobs, dignity, freedom of
movement--and land, the most precious currency in this old turf war.
Israel hasn't announced the path of the entire fence but has said it
will wall an "adjusted" boundary rather than stick to the pre-1967
Israeli-Palestinian frontier.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil Turfakji, a cartographer for the Palestinian Authority, has
examined Israeli army documents indicating that the fence will chop
at least 30 square miles of earth from the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to put it on the real border; they're going to
put it well into Palestinian territory," said Michael Tarazi, a
Palestine Liberation Organization negotiator. "It's a formalized
annexation, a de facto land grab."</TE>
<TE>   Nationalist Israelis are also distressed--they don't want to
cleave the land they regard as the God-given home of the Jews. But
quaking under relentless assault, many Israelis have come to regard a
wall to protect them from Palestinian invasion as an inevitable
inconvenience. "If a fence can save lives," Aloni said, "we should
have a fence."</TE>
<TE>   Radical Palestinian snipers and suicide bombers continue to make
their way into Israel over the desert, along old farming roads and
through the back streets where urban neighborhoods press together. No
matter how many roadblocks Israeli soldiers construct--and no matter
how many times they storm West Bank villages to interrogate and
arrest militants--the attackers keep coming.</TE>
<TE>   "They're shooting all the time," Hamatul Kadman said. The
23-year-old kindergarten teacher lives down the road from Salit in
Eyal, a broad, leafy kibbutz that comes under frequent fire from the
Palestinian territories. "A lot of people are scared."</TE>
<TE>   Just a few months ago, a young Kfar Sava girl was killed when a
Palestinian sniper opened fire on a group of students. A short walk
across flat fields from the West Bank, the city is an easy target.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us wake up in the morning hesitating, wondering what day
we're coming into," Kfar Sava Mayor Yitzhak Wald said. "The fence is
a must."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, the Jewish mayor
visited back and forth with his counterpart in the nearby Palestinian
city of Kalkilya. They spoke of a shared sewage system and garbage
routes, a hospital, a day care center for Palestinian mothers. In
those days, Palestinian workers set out at dawn to tromp the dusty
road to Israel. They hung around on the roadside, waited for foremen
to swing by with offers of farm and construction jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Palestinian intifada erupted in the fall of 2000, the
mayors stopped speaking to each other. Now, on the outskirts of Kfar
Sava, the Israeli army has set up concrete barricades to protect
highway construction workers from the Palestinian bullets that come
raining across the sun-baked fields.</TE>
<TE>   And so, there will be a fence. Or, in the words of some Israeli
bureaucrats, an "obstacle." Others shun the word "border" in favor of
"buffer zone."</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a fence," defense spokesman Yarden Vatikay snapped.
"It's a security perception. There is no fence."</TE>
<TE>   In a land where people call their national boundary a "seam" and
argue over whether there's such a thing as a Palestinian, syntactical
debates are nothing new. But this one is particularly sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   The fence will be a physical boundary, and boundaries have a way
of turning into hard borders--which is the last thing many Israelis
want.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since seizing the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and
East Jerusalem in 1967, many Israelis have dismissed the Green Line
between the West Bank and Israel as an imaginary division.</TE>
<TE>   And to the chagrin of peace activists and Palestinians, thousands
of Jewish settlers pushed across the boundary to build controversial,
heavily guarded compounds--such as Salit--on soil claimed by
Palestinians. The homesteaders regard themselves as pioneers. Their
Palestinian neighbors consider them intruders.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Israelis buy into settlement ideology. Conscience-stricken
soldiers periodically refuse to cross the Green Line. Peace
protesters have spread green canvas along the "seam" in a symbolic
call to pull out of the West Bank and leave the Palestinians to set
up a state.</TE>
<TE>   But what of the settlements? If the fence promises protection to
the nearby settlements, it taps into a tangled dispute over the
future of the more remote West Bank colonies. The barricade would
strand thousands of settlers within a walled Palestinian region.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the settlements may be dismantled," Transportation
Minister Ephraim Sneh said. "I wouldn't keep the border open just
because of a few settlements. The fence is very, very essential to
our protection."</TE>
<TE>   But after years of dangling generous cash inducements to get
settlers to stake out the West Bank, the Israeli government would be
hard pressed to turn its back.</TE>
<TE>   Still, among war-weary residents of Israel, a groundswell
continues: Many people now argue that the army ought to let the
settlers come back across the Green Line--or fend for themselves. If
the army can't protect its home turf from attack, they say, it's time
to stop sending troops to outlying territories.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to give up some of our dreams and come down to reality,"
said Yehiam Prior, a 54-year-old physics professor active in the
Movement for Unilateral Disengagement, a group pushing Israel to
withdraw from the West Bank and establish a permanent border. "The
gap is so deep, there's simply no hope. We've got to once and for all
convert Israel into a normal state with borders."</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, the border is cropping up already. Deep trenches
and razor wire now line the edge of Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   On the Palestinian side, women pick their way homeward on the
rubble-strewn road. On the Israeli side, a lush olive orchard rises
toward the rooftops of Gilo, a Jewish neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Ramallah, Palestinian commuters prop old car doors against
the razor-wire fences and scramble over to avoid sitting in
checkpoint lines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's apartheid; they are putting us in prison," said Nabil
Kukali, a Palestinian economics professor who spends four hours a day
hitchhiking and trekking his way through a series of checkpoints to
get to work.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear to God, we suffer every day."</TE>

<HD>Conservatives Triumph in French Vote</HD>
<DH>Europe: In a big win for Chirac, the center-right takes
control of National Assembly. Result spells the end of power-sharing
blamed for gridlock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French voters handed President Jacques Chirac a resounding majority
in Parliament on Sunday, ending five years of power-sharing that
contributed to public discontent and governmental gridlock.</LD>
<LD>   The triumph by Chirac's center-right coalition also ended a
turbulent election season that began with a divisive surprise:
Jean-Marie Le Pen, a pugnacious far-right candidate, outpolled the
Socialist standard-bearer, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, in the first
round of voting for president in April.</LD>
<LD>   But as an array of political leaders and thousands of
demonstrators accused Le Pen of fascist and intolerant ideas, the
incumbent Chirac trounced Le Pen in the presidential runoff in May.
The president's new coalition, the Union for the Presidential
Majority, went on to dominate the first round of legislative
elections last week.</LD>
<TE>   The center-right landslide in the legislative runoff Sunday
ensured the ouster of the Socialists, who spent five years in control
of the government and the 577-seat National Assembly with Chirac as
head of state. That uneasy arrangement, known as "cohabitation," was
blamed for the government's seeming inability to confront problems
such as crime, pension reform and the integration of Muslim
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "Jacques Chirac's project has won its majority in Parliament,"
said Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, a veteran of provincial
politics whom Chirac appointed to bring the governing elite closer to
the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to that mission, Raffarin declared: "Elections don't
erase problems. We will work to simplify and improve the life of the
French. We will act with firmness and openness."</TE>
<TE>   The durable 69-year-old Chirac will now have a five-year term in
which he can reassert the full powers of the presidency. His
coalition, which is more liberal than center-right parties in Europe
and the United States, won between 360 and 378 seats in the assembly,
while the Socialists won between 157 and 165, according to early
projections. An independent rightist party won an estimated 21 seats.
A handful of other parties took the remaining seats.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the right won 55% of the vote and the left had 45% with
96% of ballots counted, according to the Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen's National Front party did not win a single seat, according
to projections. That weak performance indicated that the far right's
ephemeral rise was due more to protest votes and division among
leftists than to a sharp turn to the right by the electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's election also set a record for low turnout. According to
pollsters, 37% to 40% of voters stayed home.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers revealed contradictory trends, analysts said. At the
expense of smaller parties such as the Communists, whose leader
apparently lost his parliamentary seat, many voters have coalesced
behind the two dominant political forces of the left and right.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, sectors of the urban working class and of rural "deep
France" are seriously dissatisfied with traditional politics. Such
voters backed an assortment of extremist and protest parties during
the presidential contest; many simply dropped out of the process
during the legislative race.</TE>
<TE>   "You either have people who don't vote or people who have decided
to cast what is called the 'useful vote,' " said Edouard Lecerf,
director of polling for the Ipsos public opinion firm. "This shows
it's more and more difficult to be elected. It's hard to persuade
those who have decided not to vote. There is still a lot of
dissatisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   The president has taken that troubling political reality to heart,
judging from his appointment of Raffarin and others in the interim
government formed in May. The Cabinet is unlikely to change much,
according to Lecerf. Nor is the government's determination to project
the image of hands-on pragmatism embodied by Raffarin. Voters
apparently find the prime minister refreshing because his affable,
plain-spoken style diverges from the aristocratic aloofness of other
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Raffarin has shown himself to be very convincing," Lecerf said.
"He gives the image of being close to the people. He is a real
communication specialist. There is a real thirst for action by the
government, and he realizes that."</TE>
<TE>   The French have responded positively to Chirac's moves since his
reelection, including the creation of law enforcement task forces to
restore order in high-crime zones, according to Ipsos polls. Sunday's
results reaffirmed support for Chirac's cautious brand of
conservatism.</TE>
<TE>   The president and Raffarin have promised to reduce taxes and
modify France's 35-hour workweek. That labor law was created by
Jospin to reduce unemployment by reducing the number of hours worked
and forcing employers to fill the gap with new hires.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative helped cut joblessness from 12% to 9%, according to
the Socialists. But the center-right says the 35-hour week also added
another layer of bureaucracy to France's cumbersome labor codes,
stifling growth. The government hopes to modify the law to ease the
burden it places on small and medium-sized businesses.</TE>
<TE>   France has been permeated by the same center-right wave that has
already washed across Italy, Spain and other European nations,
focusing the political debate on free-market policies and law and
order. Nonetheless, the changes in France promise to be gradual
rather than radical, pragmatic rather than ideological.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's results only reiterated April's drubbing of the
Socialists at the hands of disgruntled French voters. Some of the
party's best-known faces lost their races.</TE>
<TE>   The left will have to clean up the wreckage of the last two months
and rebuild, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is democratic to recognize defeat, which is what we do
tonight," said Socialist leader Laurent Fabius. "The left will have
to reflect, rebuild and reunite."</TE>

<HD>Mideast Plan a Tough Sell</HD>
<DH>Policy: An expected Bush proposal for an interim
Palestinian state could be risky, experts say. It also raises a host
of difficult issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The proposal to create an interim Palestinian state that President
Bush is expected to make this week may jump-start the Middle East
peace process, but it is likely to raise a host of thorny questions
that will have to be addressed before the new entity can become a
reality, according to U.S. analysts and regional experts.</LD>
<LD>   The concept is vulnerable to opposition from Palestinians and
Israelis, as well as to new rounds of violence, Americans with long
experience in mediating the half-century-old conflict warn.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't matter whether the idea is an interim state or a final
state or different variations in between, if the realities on the
ground don't change, then we won't have a chance to pursue any of
them," said Dennis B. Ross, special Middle East envoy during the
administrations of Bush's father and President Clinton.</LD>
<TE>   In historical and legal terms, the interim state concept is unique
and would require extensive diplomacy to fully define and major
international pressure to realize, analysts say. "It's not going to
be a kind of state in the remaking, like Afghanistan. It's not going
to be a state in the making like East Timor. Both had either formal
or informal trusteeships over them. The international community came
in, in one form or another, and oversaw the process of building the
state or rebuilding it," said Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador
to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration national security team--including Vice
President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, CIA
Director George J. Tenet, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice
and White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr.--spent the weekend
meeting behind closed doors to work out details of the proposal. But
they will have to leave many issues for the Israelis and Palestinians
to decide--and that's where deadlock could once again set in,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The concept also could have a far-reaching impact on other hot
spots. An interim state would set a precedent; opposition and
secessionist movements worldwide might want to follow the Palestinian
model to achieve eventual statehood, constitutional lawyers and
international affairs experts predict.</TE>
<TE>   "It's new. It's risky. And it's possibly the best possible
solution for the Middle East right now," said Paul Williams, a former
State Department lawyer who is now an American University professor
of law and international relations. "But it's also quite possible
that others--like Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers or the Basques of Spain or
Russia's Chechens or Iraq's Kurds or dozens of other groups--could
look around and say, 'If the Palestinians are getting an interim
state, why don't we?' "</TE>
<TE>   In the Middle East, the concept's viability will depend on the
answers to several questions, such as where an interim state's
authority would begin and end. One version of the proposal debated
over the weekend calls for the Palestinians to have a seat at the
United Nations--where they now have "permanent observer" status--and
at other international organizations, as well as the power to sign
treaties, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   More problematic will be the interim state's jurisdiction at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush proposal is expected to defer the three difficult issues
of a final settlement--the borders of a permanent Palestine, the
status of Jerusalem and the right of Palestinian refugees to return,
U.S. officials say. Thus, the interim state's borders and
capital--probably the West Bank city of Ramallah--would be temporary.</TE>
<TE>   But the borders of the current Palestinian Authority--about 40% of
the West Bank and two-thirds of the Gaza Strip--have been complicated
by the recent Israeli military incursion into the West Bank, experts
say. The Israeli army operates in several areas that are now only
nominally under Palestinian control, Indyk said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many of the Palestinian institutions and security
forces were destroyed during the incursion.</TE>
<TE>   "For now, there's no capability in place on the Palestinian side
to stop the violence, so there's no basis for the [Israeli] army to
withdraw," Indyk said. "So it's not clear what borders there would be
and what policing mechanism would be available to maintain order. The
security institutions are being rebuilt, but they don't have any
capability at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   The border issue has led Palestinians to raise doubts about the
interim state idea, especially since the Arab world has demanded that
Israel return all territories it occupied in the 1967 Middle East
War. Some Palestinians question whether an interim state would prove
a trap, leaving them indefinitely with little more than what has been
the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard of provisional government, but I have never heard of
a provisional state," said Ali Jirbawi, a Palestinian political
scientist at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. "What does it
mean? Is it a state that is supposed to continue growing until it
reaches the 1967 borders, or would it be a cantonized state? Nobody
knows."</TE>
<TE>   Figuring out how to allow an interim state to expand into a
permanent country over time is likely to bog down the negotiating
process, said James Steinberg, deputy national security advisor
during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is not an understanding among Palestinians about the
size of the final state, then you're not going to be able to stop the
violence," Steinberg said. "There has to be enough concreteness at
the time an interim state is established so that they know what the
outcome will be. It needs to be a process they believe will work. If
they don't know where it will end up, there will not be the incentive
to make it work."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Israel will want guarantees that accepting an
interim state will pay a peace dividend. But such a dividend could be
a long way off; few believe that militants will let up on their
efforts to derail the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon briefed his Cabinet on Sunday
about his White House meeting last week, saying he had reiterated to
Bush that a Palestinian state can come only after the violence ends
and serious reforms are implemented.</TE>
<TE>   "I clarified that this is not the time for any type of Palestinian
state," Sharon said, according to Cabinet Secretary Gideon Saar.</TE>
<TE>   Another basic question is where Israel's authority over its
long-occupied territories would begin and end.</TE>
<TE>   Since its original military response to a massive suicide bombing
on the eve of Passover, Israel has continued sporadic incursions into
the West Bank--always operating on the basis that it enjoys the
freedom to do so, Ross said. But if the Palestinian Authority became
an interim state, Israel presumably would be crossing international
borders.</TE>
<TE>   Any hot-pursuit attack could be viewed as a formal act of war,
legal experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   This issue is one reason that, following Bush's expected proposal,
an interim Palestinian state might not officially be declared until
the violence is curtailed or under control, Mideast diplomats say.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for all the questions surrounding it, an interim state
would have many benefits, said Williams, the American University
professor. Most important, perhaps, is that it would be subject to
international law, meaning that various mechanisms would be available
to hold the Palestinians accountable for their actions.</TE>

<HD>Kashmir Violence Rolls On, Claiming 21 Lives</HD>
<DH>S. Asia: Gunmen storm a Hindu village and kill five people
in one of day's incidents.</DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Twenty-one people, including five Hindu villagers, were killed on
Sunday in several incidents of separatist violence in Indian Kashmir,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   The violence comes despite U.S.-led international efforts to pull
nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan back from the brink of a
fourth war.</LD>
<LD>   Police said suspected Muslim rebels shot dead five Hindu villagers
in the Himalayan region's Udhampur district on Sunday. Security
forces rushed to the village.</LD>
<TE>   "Militants descended on a village and barged into the houses of
the minority community and opened fire. Five people died and four
were injured," a police official said in Jammu, the winter capital of
Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state.</TE>
<TE>   Police said three civilians including two village defense
committee members were killed by unidentified militants in the same
area. No militant group has claimed responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Four members of the pro-Pakistani Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen militant
group and a civilian were killed in a fierce gun battle in Budgam
district, west of Srinagar, the summer capital of the state, police
said. Two soldiers were also wounded in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, a police officer was killed and three
policemen were injured when separatist guerrillas attacked a police
patrol in Pulwama district, south of Srinagar.</TE>
<TE>   Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen claimed responsibility for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "A group of Hezbul militants attacked SOG [Special Operations
Group] in Pulwama and inflicted heavy casualty," Salim Hashmi,
spokesman of Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, said. SOG is the counterinsurgency
arm of the Jammu and Kashmir Police.</TE>
<TE>   Five militants, a civilian and a paramilitary soldier were killed
in other shootouts across the region.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a dozen militant groups are battling Indian rule in the
state. India accuses Pakistan of stoking the revolt in Kashmir by
sending militants across a cease-fire line dividing the region.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan denies the charge, saying it provides only moral and
diplomatic support.</TE>
<TE>   Police said an attack Saturday in which suspected Islamic
guerrillas lobbed grenades and fired at about 500 Hindu pilgrims
trudging down from a mountaintop shrine, killed three Hindu children
and three of their Muslim escorts. Initial reports had said two
children were killed. Seven pilgrims were wounded in the attack in a
remote area 100 miles northeast of Jammu.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Assembly Drifts as Delegates All Stick In Oars</HD>
<DH>Government: Debate over how to form a legislature drags out
decision-making. Meeting is extended for at least another day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Delegates to the grand assembly charting Afghanistan's future bogged
down in debate Sunday over what kind of legislature is needed,
threatening to drag out their talks through most of this week even
though the key remaining decisions are likely to be made by
President-elect Hamid Karzai.</LD>
<LD>   The haggling over how to compose a transitional parliament for the
government Karzai will head for the next 18 months--and even over
whether such a body is needed--frittered away another day of the loya
jirga. It was originally scheduled to wind up Sunday after a week of
sessions.</LD>
<LD>   The delay and drawn-out deliberations prompted some delegates to
complain that their time was being wasted. While speaker after
speaker has grabbed the microphone to lament local problems or
lambaste the residual power of warlords, Karzai's outgoing interim
government has been working on the vital personnel decisions.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Afghanistan's fragile security was highlighted
by two bomb explosions in the southern city of Kandahar that
inflicted no casualties but prompted speculation that Al Qaeda agents
or stragglers from the deposed Taliban regime were to blame. The
bombs, hidden inside spare tires on two gas tanker trucks headed for
the U.S. military base outside the city, detonated when the vehicles
were still miles from the compound. It was at least the fourth attack
aimed at U.S. sites in the region, the birthplace of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's authority during the six-month interim government term
that expires Saturday hardly extended beyond Kabul, the capital. A
power-sharing deal he reached with a clique of Tajik and Uzbek
commanders kept a lid on most fighting, but unless those militia
chiefs are included in the new government, Karzai's tenuous hold on
the country could be disastrously weakened.</TE>
<TE>   Beholden to the warlords who ousted the Taliban last year and who
still control all police and security forces, Karzai has made clear
that his next Cabinet will be his decision, not that of the loya
jirga. Likewise, his reported preference for a smaller advisory body
rather than a parliament was being conveyed to the assembly in
behind-the-scenes talks overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Despite hours of discussion about the merits of proportional
representation versus an equal voice for each province, no vote was
taken on whether to form a legislature from among the loya jirga
delegates or create a smaller consultative shura that would simply
advise Karzai. The session broke off two hours early Sunday--the
third straight day during which none of the assembly's assigned tasks
was decided.</TE>
<TE>   The gathering originally was expected to choose a head of state,
define the structure of government and decide key positions. But so
far, it has accomplished only the first task, and that choice on
Thursday was largely preordained by the withdrawal of Karzai's main
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's former king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, and a previous
president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, dropped out of the running. The
former monarch was under U.S. pressure not to provoke the warlords,
and Rabbani was suspected of having made a deal for a prestigious
office.</TE>
<TE>   According to a U.N.-brokered agreement reached last year, the loya
jirga was supposed to decide the heads of the legislative and
judicial branches as well. Foreign observers say the accord also
suggested that the loya jirga should be involved in the Cabinet
selection.</TE>
<TE>   But Karzai told reporters the day after his election to the
presidency that his list of appointments probably wouldn't be ready
before the loya jirga adjourned.</TE>
<TE>   After Sunday's debate halted, Karzai's chief advisor, Ashref
Ghani, implied that the other decisions are also likely to be made by
the new head of state. Ghani described the parliament issue as the
last task for the gathering, saying the delegates would be asked for
"endorsement of the proposals of the president-elect regarding the
structure of the government."</TE>
<TE>   That atmosphere of fait accompli has riled many delegates and left
them feeling that the first loya jirga in a quarter-century will
disperse with little more to its credit than applying a rubber stamp.</TE>
<TE>   "All this is being done to legitimize a scenario already written
by the powerful," said delegate Homayoom Asefi.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Abdullah, one of the former Northern Alliance
commanders likely to retain power in the new Cabinet, said that the
loya jirga has been newly scheduled to wrap up today but that there
would be no problem "extending for another day or two."</TE>
<TE>   The only real deadline facing Karzai, said government spokesman
Omar Samad, is Saturday's expiration of the interim government's
term. But he suggested that even a prolonged grand assembly would
have little role in Cabinet appointments, calling it "improbable and
implausible" to seek the judgment of 1,600 people.</TE>

<HD>Beloved Pio Becomes a Saint</HD>
<DH>Religion: The pope canonizes one of the most popular modern
Catholic figures, known for his healing powers and stigmata.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II made it official Sunday: Padre Pio, long regarded
by followers as a saint, was canonized in a ceremony at St. Peter's
Square that drew one of the largest crowds ever for such an event.</LD>
<LD>   The day marked an extraordinary comeback for the widely beloved
Capuchin friar, who died in 1968 at 81. He was believed by many to
carry the crucifixion wounds of Christ but was repeatedly
investigated by the Vatican as a suspected fraud or sexual wrongdoer.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most popular Roman Catholic figures of the 20th
century, Padre Pio was said during his lifetime to be able to grant
miracles, predict the future, read people's minds and be in two
places at once. His supporters also saw him as a deeply holy man who
inspired huge numbers of people to greater faith--the characteristic
for which John Paul seemed most intent on honoring him.</LD>
<TE>   About 300,000 pilgrims and residents of Rome turned out under a
blazing sun to participate in his elevation to sainthood, police
said. The huge crowds assembled in and around St. Peter's Square, on
roads leading to the Vatican and at another square where a giant
television screen carried the 2 1/2-hour ceremony live.</TE>
<TE>   Padre Pio "loved to repeat, 'I'm a poor friar who prays,' " John
Paul said in his homily. The new saint was "convinced that 'prayer is
the best weapon we have, a key that opens the heart of God.' "</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, dressed in gold and white vestments, also recalled how
in 1947, as a young priest, he had journeyed from his native Poland
so that Padre Pio could hear his confession.</TE>
<TE>   "We register him in the list of saints and establish that
throughout the church he be devotedly honored," the pontiff declared,
to the applause of his listeners.</TE>
<TE>   Most seemed thrilled to be present despite the discomfort, but
medical workers tended to hundreds on the spot and took dozens to
hospitals, mainly to treat effects of the heat. Toward the end of the
ceremony, workers used huge water hoses to spray the crowd, and
hundreds of thousands of free containers of drinking water were
distributed, some labeled "Saint Padre Pio."</TE>
<TE>   Civil defense officials said the temperature in the square climbed
to 97.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, 82, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and is very
frail, was sheltered from the sun by a canopy over the altar set on
the steps of St. Peter's Basilica. Despite the heat, he spoke at
length, showing greater endurance than he had at any of his
appearances on a May trip to Azerbaijan and Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   The pontiff read out a prayer he composed asking Padre Pio to
"sustain us in the hour of combat and trial" and urging that he teach
believers to "recognize the face of Christ in those who suffer and
the poor."</TE>
<TE>   Padre Pio's life showed that "difficulties and pains, if accepted
for love, are transformed into a privileged path toward holiness,"
John Paul said.</TE>
<TE>   Named Francesco Forgione at birth, Padre Pio was in his teens when
he joined the Capuchins, a Franciscan order known for vows of
poverty. Both his fame and the controversy that swirled around him
began in 1918, when word spread that he had been marked by
stigmata--wounds on his hands, feet and side similar to those of
Jesus on the cross.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, some popes respected him and others were
suspicious. Doubt was cast on his stigmata, which his followers said
were a sign of holiness that he bore until death. He was banned at
times from saying Mass or hearing confessions.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, under Pope John XXIII, an investigation
reported allegations that Padre Pio was having sexual relations with
female devotees. After his death, another Vatican investigation
cleared him of those charges.</TE>
<TE>   A biography in a booklet used for Sunday's ceremony cited his
ever-greater popularity as a sign that he deserved sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   "In the years following his death, his reputation for sanctity and
miracles grew steadily and became established in the church all over
the world and among all kinds of people," it said. "God thus showed
the church his desire to glorify on earth his faithful servant."</TE>
<TE>   For sainthood, the Vatican requires certification of two miracles
attributed to the figure's intercession after his or her death, one
for beatification and one for canonization. In the case of Padre Pio,
the first miracle was the unexplained 1995 recovery of an Italian
woman with a chest ailment, and the second was the 2000 recovery of a
boy from a meningitis-induced coma.</TE>
<TE>   Luca Frattura, 38, was among those at St. Peter's Square who came
with a personal plea.</TE>
<TE>   "People need assurances that the world doesn't give, but Padre Pio
does," Frattura said. "Because my wife is sick, I also want to ask
for something."</TE>
<TE>   Frattura said that while prayers don't always seem to be answered,
"suffering ... doesn't have to be understood as a negative thing." It
can be "a cross" that brings salvation, and "that is the miracle," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what Padre Pio means to her, Giuliana Anania, 54, replied,
"Everything: life, love, peace, serenity."</TE>
<TE>   "He did many miracles, so many people believe in him," said her
friend, Caterina Fragale, 41.</TE>
<TE>   The two women had arrived at St. Peter's Square at 6 a.m. for the
10 a.m. ceremony but were already too late to get inside, Fragale
said. They finally made it in about half an hour before the service
ended. Asked how they did it, she replied: "We prayed. We prayed to a
policeman."</TE>

<HD>Hussein Ouster Is Backed</HD>
<DH>Policy: Top Democrats and Republicans support Bush plan
reportedly OKing possible use of CIA and Special Forces to remove
Iraqi leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Key congressional leaders expressed support Sunday for President
Bush's bid to oust Saddam Hussein, backing an administration plan
that gives the CIA authority to remove the Iraqi leader from power.</LD>
<LD>   Breaking ranks with foreign leaders who have voiced strong
opposition to toppling Hussein by force, both Democrats and
Republicans on Capitol Hill said Hussein's violations of
international law and alleged backing of terrorism would justify
action by the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it is an appropriate action to take," House Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said during an appearance on ABC's
"This Week."</LD>
<TE>   Gephardt, who said he had been briefed by intelligence officials
about the Bush administration's plans, noted that Hussein "continues
to prepare weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   "There is broad support for a regime change in Iraq," Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said on "Fox News Sunday." "We
want to work with the administration and try to find the best way and
the best time to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Details of the plan were contained in a Washington Post story
Sunday that said Bush authorized the CIA last winter to expand its
intelligence efforts within Iraq and to provide money, weapons and
training to Iraqi opposition forces. The newspaper also said Bush's
plan approved the "possible use" of CIA and U.S. Special Forces teams
to capture Hussein, or even kill him in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Polls have shown Americans split on deposing Hussein if doing so
means significant military action. But Bush has declared Iraq part of
an "axis of evil," along with North Korea and Iran, because of its
support of terrorism and its efforts to develop weapons of mass
destruction</TE>
<TE>   Experts have said that as many as 200,000 U.S. ground troops might
be required to topple Hussein. In the face of strong international
opposition, the administration has put off plans for possible
military action until at least next year, officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional leaders said they expected action before too
long.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam Hussein's around five years from now, we've failed,"
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr.
(D-Del.) said on CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Several Republican leaders also offered support for Bush's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that Saddam Hussein harbors, fosters [and]
financially supports terrorism," House Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas) said on "This Week." "So if, in fact, we have an
opportunity to make the world safer ... interdiction against this
kind of a sponsorship of terrorists, I'm sure, is a wise and prudent
thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has taken issue with Bush on many
occasions, expressed qualified support for a regime change in Iraq.
He said he favored the idea if it could be done "on the
cheap"--without a massive troop deployment.</TE>

<HD>Arousing Debate in Egypt</HD>
<DH>A move to lift the ban on Viagra is stimulating discussion
of difficult subjects, including sex education, population growth and
corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>With the possible exception of the Palestinian conflict, few events
have been as widely discussed here, as deeply debated. Newspapers,
magazines and office gossip in contemporary Egypt have all focused on
the same pressing issue:</LD>
<LD>   When will Viagra be on store shelves?</LD>
<LD>   The little blue pill that fights male impotence has been illegal
here since it first hit the global market, although it is routinely
smuggled and widely available at a premium. A former health minister
banned the drug, saying it "would destroy family relations."</LD>
<TE>   The current minister has moved to lift the ban, a decision that
will make Viagra, while still expensive for most Egyptians, a lot
cheaper. Prices are expected to drop by half, from about $10 per
tablet on the black market.</TE>
<TE>   "Egyptian Men Soon to Be Virile in Bed," announced a recent
front-page headline in the English- language Egyptian Mail, in a
story hailing the minister's decision. "My fellow men, it's time to
rejoice," the article concluded.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not just Viagra's medical effectiveness that has made it
such a hot topic. To talk about Viagra is to confront many of Egypt's
most pressing issues, from an unmanageable population explosion, to
government corruption, to the anxieties of a conservative religious
society where neither men nor women are taught much about their own
bodies.</TE>
<TE>   This is still a country where most women undergo genital excision
and where discussing sex between a husband and a wife remains
taboo--facts that have also fueled the Viagra dialogues.</TE>
<TE>   "There is lack of early marriage, economic troubles, lack of
apartments for the ordinary middle class, a lack of economic means,
and the population is suffering," said Dr. Aziz Khattab, 77, a
pioneer in sex education in Egypt. "If you propagate love in Egypt,
it will be the solution to lots of Arab problems."</TE>
<TE>   Egyptians are good at making jokes and poking fun at themselves,
and Viagra has spawned its share of quips, like the one told by a
religious scholar involving the man who took five Viagra tablets and
died. "There was only one thing standing up when guests came to pay
their condolences," joked Abdel Sabur Shaheen, a linguistics
professor and widely respected religious thinker in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   But these are serious issues, issues that Shaheen and his
community are struggling to come to terms with, issues that cut to
the core of this tradition-bound developing country. Take the case of
young men: They are terrified of their wedding nights. Not all of
them, of course, but enough that Khattab said he put a whole chapter
titled "Wedding Night Syndrome" in his textbook on human sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, said Tarek Shabrawy, a 25-year-old pharmacist in Cairo.
He said young men often buy Viagra and a sensation-killing "delay
spray" to help consummate their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in Egypt, we have no experience before marriage," Shabrawy
said. "We have something inside us that frightens us. So some guys
take drugs to help."</TE>
<TE>   Shabrawy explained, however, that this is a more complex issue
than the common psychological stress of performance anxiety. It has
its roots in social conventions that demand that men buy a home and
pay a bride price before they can get married. But the economy is so
bad, unemployment is so rife and housing is so limited that few young
men can meet the requirements--especially in the big cities--and so
they must wait.</TE>
<TE>   "In the states, they condone sex before marriage, but here that is
a problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are matters of religion. Under Islamic law, a woman may
initiate a divorce if her husband doesn't gratify her sexually. (Of
course, it's difficult for a woman to prove that to the satisfaction
of the male-dominated system.) "If a man can't satisfy his wife, she
may commit adultery and that may open the door to prostitution," said
Shaheen, the religious scholar. "To protect against sin if he can't
satisfy her, she has the right to divorce."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there are complications that stem from values linked to a
traditional way of life outside the teachings of Islam. Among them is
the much-criticized practice of genital excision, widely known here
as female circumcision.</TE>
<TE>   According to the most recent comprehensive health survey,
conducted in 2000, 97% of women of child-bearing age in Egypt
reported having undergone the procedure, and Khattab said half of
those women cannot reach a climax during sex. One physician in his
20s said that excision, while catastrophic for women, puts added
pressure on already performance-conscious men. Many, he said, turn to
Viagra, or at least want to.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is using it," said Ahmed Tantawy, 25, another
pharmacist. "They think they will be stronger if they take it."</TE>
<TE>   An Ancient Quest</TE>
<TE>   This interest in performance enhancers is hardly new. For
centuries, Egyptians have turned to herbal remedies, like the mixture
of more than 16 herbs called "Happy Life" sold in a renowned herb
shop here.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe all the men are afraid women will go with strangers," said
Abdullah Salah, the manager of a nearby spice shop. "So they take
this stuff to make them stronger and more satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   The obsession with sexual aids is almost as old as Egypt itself.
The country's chief of antiquities, Zahi Hawass, said that during the
New Kingdom, about the 13th century BC, Ramses II also looked for a
little pick-me-up. In portraits of Ramses, "he is always depicted
with a strong erection," Hawass said. "But how does he get that
strong erection? Through lettuce. Lettuce was the Viagra of today."</TE>
<TE>   In modern Egypt, the complex issues associated with human
sexuality have had such a ripple effect across society that a
prominent filmmaker, the late Salah abu Seif, tried for 30 years to
address them in a film he wanted to call "The Sex School."</TE>
<TE>   The plot revolved around a husband and wife who were unable to
satisfy each other. The couple went to a therapist and discovered
that the woman had problems because she always recalled the day she
underwent excision, and the man was troubled because of a bad
experience he had with a prostitute. The therapist helped them get
past their problems. But state censors stopped Abu Seif from ever
making the movie.</TE>
<TE>   This year, his son Mohammed, also a filmmaker, changed the name to
"The Peacock and the Ostrich," and it was finally shown to the public
in March.</TE>
<TE>   "Viewers may not imagine that the film addresses a problem that
existed 30 years ago and still does," wrote a reviewer on an Arab-
language Web site. "The film demonstrates that society views sex as a
taboo, even between husband and wife."</TE>
<TE>   Many of these issues--not just personal, but also
institutional--are being discussed in the context of Viagra.
Originally designed as a vascular dilator to lower blood pressure,
the drug, the Pfizer pharmaceutical company noticed, improved blood
circulation, helping men with erectile dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   It has become one of the most prescribed medicines worldwide,
including in the Muslim world, since first entering the market in
April 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But not in Egypt. In addition to being destructive to the family,
health officials charged, it could undermine Egypt's efforts to
control the growth of a population that has surged from 20 million in
1952 to about 67 million today.</TE>
<TE>   Many people here believe the ban had little to do with health
concerns and everything to do with a government bureaucracy that is
either incompetent or corrupt. Keeping the drug illegal did make a
lot of people rich. Viagra is reportedly the No. 1 smuggled item in
Egypt, and in the last two years, customs police have seized at least
765,000 pills.</TE>
<TE>   But many more pills make it into Egypt. Traders travel to Syria,
China, Jordan or India, where they buy huge quantities of Viagra, or
a locally produced generic equivalent. In Syria, for example, it's
called Viga. The drugs are then carried in ordinary suitcases through
the airport to Mosky Street in central Cairo, known for wholesaling
smuggled pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   "Sales associates" distribute the goods to pharmacies around the
country. Two pharmacists estimated that 85% of all pharmacies in
Egypt carry Viagra. It's sold under the counter to anyone who asks,
they said. Prices vary depending on where the drug was manufactured.
Although many Egyptians are boycotting U.S. products because of
Washington's support for Israel, when it comes to Viagra, people want
American.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Egyptians have offered to pay up to 100 pounds
($22) per tablet.</TE>
<TE>   Just this month, Pfizer said it received permission from Egypt's
government to begin producing and selling its profitable drug here,
and a company spokesman said Viagra should be on the
market--legally--within a month. Pfizer expects more than $10 million
in annual sales in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Though there was no formal declaration as to why Viagra is being
approved now, the government decision recognizes that, even with the
ban, it is on the market and that, by lifting the prohibition, Egypt
stands to benefit economically through increased tax revenue and jobs
for pharmaceutical workers.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian drug companies are pressing for the right to make a
generic version; if they do, the price could be as low as $1.50 a
tablet.</TE>
<TE>   'Viagra Became Famous'</TE>
<TE>   But legal Viagra still has many people worried--and on many
different levels. To begin with, Egyptians have the impression that
Viagra is an aphrodisiac. Its reputation has become so widespread
that physicians report men slipping Viagra into women's drinks. One
man said he was paying his lawyer in Viagra tablets. Another said he
managed to get permission to add three stories to his apartment
building by bribing a state official with a few Viagra tablets.</TE>
<TE>   "Viagra became famous," said Salah, the manager of the spice shop.
"It is something new to Egyptians, and that is why all Egyptians want
to try it."</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is that Egypt's pharmacies sell almost anything to
anyone. The law, for example, doesn't require prescriptions for
strong antibiotics; therefore, many people self-medicate. It does
require a prescription for sedatives, but those also are sold to
almost anyone who asks.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials said they expect that the government will
restrict Viagra use to prescriptions, drug companies say there is no
reason to believe that the system will suddenly work.</TE>
<TE>   And Shaheen, the religious scholar, believes that as soon as
Viagra is widely available, the population will explode.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bring Viagra to Egypt, after 20 years, the population will
increase by 100 million," he said. "When Viagra comes, it will be
like hashish. Anyone will take it, not only people with medical
problems."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood May Be Saying Auf Wiedersehen to Funds</HD>
<DH>Filmmaking: Anxiety spreads as a flood of cash from German
investors threatens to dry up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the cameras panned the Kodak Theatre during this year's Academy
Awards telecast, they caught Jim Broadbent striding to the stage to
accept his Oscar for best supporting actor. Next came a shot of his
"Iris" co-star, Dame Judi Dench. But most of the movie's producers
were nowhere in sight. The theater couldn't accommodate the 9,000
Germans who financed the film.</LD>
<LD>   During the last five years, more than $12 billion has quietly
poured into Hollywood from Germany, bankrolling everything from art
house hits such as "Iris" to megaplex flops such as John Travolta's
"Battlefield Earth."</LD>
<LD>   Virtually overnight, investors looking for prestige, profits and
extraordinary tax breaks began funding as much as 20% of the
industry's output--the most significant source of financing outside
the studios themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Without German investors, Arnold Schwarzenegger would not be back
as the Terminator for a third time.</TE>
<TE>   Now this torrent of cash is just as suddenly threatening to
evaporate because of the collapsing stock prices of German media
companies and the German government's desire to limit generous tax
write-offs. As a result, anxiety is spreading throughout Hollywood
over how an industry that has become addicted to massive injections
of overseas cash will weather the withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hollywood always has been adept at picking the pockets of
wealthy, star-struck foreigners, the staggering sums coming through
various kinds of German investments will be hard to replenish. "Where
is the next wave?" asked attorney Schuyler Moore, who specializes in
financing independent films. "Nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   The effect is likely to rattle Hollywood's rank and file as well.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are making less movies, there are going to be fewer jobs,"
said Cassian Elwes, head of the William Morris Agency's independent
film division. "It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   The tightening faucet, Elwes said, was evident at this spring's
Cannes film festival, where German financiers have engaged in bidding
wars that doubled the amount paid for distribution rights of American
films.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, Cannes was jammed with Germans," he said. "The
German yachts were lined up in the Old Port, at least 30 boats, one
bigger than the next."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Elwes said, the flotilla was down to three.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of German financing also could put even more pressure on
studios to shoot outside the United States, especially in Canada,
where finance and production costs are cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the German money allowed us to spend less money making
movies," said one top studio boss. "We'll have to find other money to
replace it, and that will mean making more films outside of the U.S.
That's where the money is. Without the German money, there will be a
further shift away from Hollywood. Just the fact."</TE>
<TE>   Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios, in particular, have used
German financing to boost the number of movies they make each year.
This has allowed them to stretch their film budgets in an era of
corporate belt-tightening.</TE>
<TE>   Ambitious independent studios, meanwhile, have come to rely on
Germans to help generate big-budget productions, once the sole
province of the majors.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, for example, German investors are underwriting
Intermedia Films' $100-million submarine thriller "K-19: The
Widowmaker" starring Harrison Ford. They also are subsidizing
Franchise Pictures' $65-million Michael Douglas comedy, "Till Death
Do Us Part," scheduled for release next year.</TE>
<TE>   "It has leveled the playing field for the independents who want to
compete with the studios," Lions Gate Chief Executive Jon Feltheimer
said of the German financing.</TE>
<TE>   Now the biggest competition probably will be the race to lock in
deals before it's too late. "It's a melting ice cube," said one
studio executive. "Grab what you can."</TE>
<TE>   That's why one of the more popular guys in Hollywood these days is
Michael Ohoven, chief executive of Infinity International
Entertainment, the studio arm of a company that pools money from
thousands of investors to finance individual projects.</TE>
<TE>   The investors--doctors, lawyers, industrialists--can write off
100% of their contributions to the investment funds, a boon that the
German government is considering limiting, as it has done with other
film investment vehicles considered too generous.</TE>
<TE>   Ohoven, 28, serves as the eyes and ears of his father, Mario, who
controls funding company Cinerenta, which has invested about $400
million in more than 30 Hollywood movies over the last four years,
including "The Contender" and "Jeepers Creepers."</TE>
<TE>   On one recent day the younger Ohoven was comfortably ensconced in
a star trailer in a Hollywood parking lot, where he is overseeing his
next movie, "Confidence," starring Edward Burns and Dustin Hoffman.
Ohoven's powerful role as a source of dwindling money is not lost on
him or on those who come knocking.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is very welcoming to us," he said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   For some studios, the German investment funds have become a way to
avoid spending their own money on movies perceived as box-office
risks.</TE>
<TE>   Director Rob Cohen was not happy when he learned that Universal
Studios was financing his film, "The Fast and the Furious," through a
German film fund. "It meant that the studio didn't believe in the
movie," Cohen said. "It was a bummer."</TE>
<TE>   He learned about the arrangement when Universal executives finally
agreed to his $38-million budget after they had pressed him for
months to slash it by more than $8 million. Under the deal, the
German investors would receive one-third of the profits for
underwriting one-third of the movie. Cohen said Universal was so
generous because the studio didn't think there would be any profits
to divvy.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the car-racing film became a surprise hit, generating
$145 million in U.S. theaters, a total of $200 million in theaters
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Universal executives privately have vowed never again to use
German funds that give investors a share of the profits for movies
that look the least bit promising.</TE>
<TE>   But German financiers know it's not that easy.</TE>
<TE>   "If the studios always knew what would work, they wouldn't need
outside money at all," said Stefan Lutje, a German attorney and film
fund expert.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that it hasn't been much easier for the folks putting
up the money.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the $60-million Sylvester Stallone thriller initially
called "Eye See You." With a marquee star--and the director of the
teen horror hit "I Know What You Did Last Summer"--thousands of
German investors in 1998 ponied up. But when executives at Universal,
which was going to distribute the film, got a look at this story of
hell on Earth at a wilderness Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, they
quietly shelved it. Last year, the studio sent the movie straight to
video, selling it to Blockbuster Entertainment. Renamed "D-Tox," it
made only $6 million in 30 international markets.</TE>
<TE>   Although the investors could take advantage of the 100% tax break,
their money was gone, according to Jean-Louis Rubin, president of
Capella International, the film's supervising producer. "The deal, on
paper, made sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason: The well-heeled of Germany pay more than half of their
income in taxes and are constantly looking for ways to shelter their
money.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, with the costs of German reunification mounting,
the finance ministry reduced the number of tax shelters. But the film
funds survived because of a quirk in German copyright law, even
though not one frame of film must be shot in Germany and not one
German must be hired.</TE>
<TE>   "This is free money from the German taxpayer for Hollywood," said
Bernard Tubeileh, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "It's complete
nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   In the next few weeks, the German finance ministry will decide
whether these film funds will keep their special status. If not, the
last of the German largess will vanish from Hollywood, going the way
of the money that gushed from the German stock market before its
plunge two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Few producers will see their world change more dramatically than
Elie Samaha, whose travels through Hollywood show how resilient
German investors have been and why the industry already is mourning
the prospect of their passing.</TE>
<TE>   A dry cleaner turned Hollywood nightclub owner, Samaha used
everything from German stock market money to tax-free funds to launch
more than a dozen movies, starting in 1999 with "The Whole Nine
Yards," starring Bruce Willis.</TE>
<TE>   His friendships with stars gained him instant entree with the
German moneyed class and with Warner Bros. Pictures, which agreed to
distribute his films.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of Samaha's movies have been box-office disasters,
including Travolta's "Battlefield Earth," "Get Carter" with Stallone
and "3000 Miles to Graceland" starring Kevin Costner.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, he had a bitter falling-out with his original German
partner, Intertainment Licensing, which has since filed a lawsuit
accusing Samaha of cheating the firm out of $75 million through
fraudulent bookkeeping--an allegation under investigation by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   As Samaha denied wrongdoing, the money continued to flow from
other hopeful investors. "No one has abandoned me," Samaha
said--including Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very valuable part of a comprehensive program we have
here," said Steve Spira, a Warner's executive vice president. "We
give him movies we can't afford to make and he makes them for less
than we could."</TE>
<TE>   Although the German riches may soon be gone, Samaha and others are
banking on Hollywood's enduring sex appeal to attract a new crop of
investors.</TE>
<TE>   "These are moths attracted to the Hollywood spotlight," said John
Miller, managing director of J.P. Morgan Securities, the industry's
leading banker. "They are very easily seduced."</TE>

<HD>Scholarships for Achievement, Not Need, Increase Rapidly</HD>
<DH>College: The shift comes largely in response to
middle-class parents' concerns about costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College scholarships, long directed at needy students, increasingly are
being awarded based on achievement rather than financial hardship.</LD>
<LD>   The result is a far greater rise in state and college grants to
relatively affluent students than to students from poor and moderate
income families, many higher education researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   "We're to the point today that almost 25% of all of the state
grant dollars to undergraduates are now awarded without any
determination of financial need," up from 10% in 1990, said Donald E.
Heller, a senior research associate with the Center for the Study of
Higher Education at Pennsylvania State University. "So that means,
literally, that the son of a janitor in Georgia would qualify for the
same kind of scholarship as would, let's say, Ted Turner's kid."</LD>
<TE>   According to an analysis by Heller, the percentage of students
from the highest-income families snaring state grants climbed four
times faster than among low-income students between the 1992-93 and
1999-2000 school years.</TE>
<TE>   Heller also found that the financially best-off students are now
about as likely as the poorest to get scholarships directly from
their schools. In the 1999-2000 school year, the nation's public and
private colleges awarded scholarships to about a fifth of students
supported by families earning $100,000 or more. The figure was
virtually identical for students from families earning less than
$20,000, according to Heller's analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Although similar figures are not available for California, the
state appears in many ways to have bucked the financial aid pattern
that has kept many low- and moderate-income students out of four-year
schools. Researchers cite the relatively moderate attendance fees at
California's public colleges and universities, along with the
substantial grants offered by the state or the schools themselves.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Irvine Foundation survey of 40 leading U.S. universities
found that four California schools --UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego
and USC, a private school--led the nation in enrolling lower-income
students. Likewise, nearly all of the 22 schools in the California
State University system have surpassed the national average for
enrolling lower-income students.</TE>
<TE>   California took a major step in 2000 by expanding its Cal Grant
aid program, which focuses on students on the bottom half of the
income scale. Meanwhile, other states, many of them in the Sun Belt,
have launched achievement-based scholarship programs that disregard
financial need.</TE>
<TE>   The shift comes largely in response to middle-class parents'
concerns about rising college costs. At the same time, colleges are
offering more merit scholarships, which tend to go to more affluent
students, to improve their academic standing. "We keep spending more
and more money on kids who were born lucky, and we increasingly
disadvantage kids who were born into poor families," said Thomas G.
Mortenson, an Iowa education policy analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Those who advocate for lower-income students say that need-based
grants have, since the 1960s, been important weapons against poverty.
They also say the redirected aid comes at the worst time: just as the
numbers of lower-income youths reaching college age are booming, and
as more low-income adults are returning to school. It also comes as
tuitions in cash-strapped states are soaring.</TE>
<TE>   More Money to Affluent</TE>
<TE>   Although Ivy League and other prestigious schools promise to cover
financial gaps for any accepted student who can't afford college
costs, admissions officers say that not many low-income students
either apply or qualify for admission. Most of the nation's nearly
$31 billion in annual grants-- especially federal grants--still go to
poor or moderate-income students. But nearly two-thirds of the
overall scholarship and grant dollars come from states or from the
schools themselves, and more of that money is being channeled to
affluent students.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, "the poor kid who is not an absolute superstar is very
likely to be frozen out," said Gordon C. Winston, an economics
professor at Williams College in Massachusetts. "Right now, we're not
in terrible shape, but I think we're getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Loans have increasingly filled the gap for students from all
economic levels, but research shows that the burden falls heaviest on
lower-income students. What's more, the fear of being saddled with
college loans, experts say, stops many low-income youths from going
to college and leads others who are qualified for four-year schools
to attend community colleges instead.</TE>
<TE>   Other low- and moderate-income students try to manage the costs of
their education by working long hours or studying part time--tactics
that, new research shows, often lead to higher dropout rates.</TE>
<TE>   Merit Scholarship Boom</TE>
<TE>   The boom in state merit scholarships is often traced to 1993, when
Georgia launched a program that became a model for other states.
Known as Georgia's HOPE Scholarship, the awards are granted to
students maintaining at least a B average in their core subjects
throughout high school and who attend colleges in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The aim was to motivate high school students, and keep the most
talented young people in Georgia once they head off to college. The
lottery-financed program has funneled scholarships totaling $1.55
billion to 605,422 students. Meanwhile, Georgia has spent little on
need-based grants, appropriating $1 million this school year,
compared with $310.3 million for HOPE scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   HOPE is the nation's largest merit-based state scholarship
program, followed by such initiatives as Florida Bright Futures,
Louisiana Tuition Opportunity Program for Students and Michigan Merit
Award.</TE>
<TE>   Sayan De, an honors student who won a nearly $4,000-a-year HOPE
scholarship to the University of Georgia and who now is bound for
medical school, has mixed feelings about HOPE.</TE>
<TE>   De, the son of two biochemists who together earn more than
$100,000 annually, said his decision to stay in-state and use his
HOPE scholarship saved his family money. He also thinks merit
scholarships are a legitimate way to encourage achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Still, De said he is troubled by the increased numbers of affluent
students from middle- and upper-middle-class suburbs who he now sees
flocking to the University of Georgia--a trend leaving fewer spaces
for low-income students at the state's flagship school. Because they
don't get enough aid, lower-income students "have less of a chance to
experience the education I think they deserve," De said.</TE>
<TE>   De isn't the only one with misgivings. Two years ago, the American
Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit charging that Michigan's merit
scholarship program relied on a standardized test that discriminated
against minority and low-income students. Civil rights advocates have
raised some related concerns in Florida, and say they are preparing
to file a complaint with the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Anita White, one of the students cited in the ACLU case against
Michigan, is heading into her junior year at Central Michigan
University, and hopes eventually to attend medical school. Yet even
though she is one of two children in a family supported by a single
mother earning just $21,000 a year, White receives no grant aid
directly from the state because her score was too low on Michigan's
standardized test.</TE>
<TE>   White, who has a 2.97 grade point average at Central Michigan, has
covered her expenses with loans and federal and university grants,
and by working on campus as a dormitory resident advisor and a
dishwasher. White said that the two jobs have taken a toll on her
studies but that she had little other choice. If you are low-income,
she said, "you have to fight for your education."</TE>
<TE>   Rich suburban high school students "get better educations, and
they get the [scholarship] money," she said.</TE>
<TE>   White and many experts acknowledge that moderate-income
students--essentially those with family earnings in the vicinity of
the U.S. median of about $51,000 a year--are pinched too. They
typically can't qualify for federal grants, which mainly go to
students from families earning less than $40,000. Also, unless they
both live and attend school in a handful of comparatively generous
states such as California, these students often don't qualify for
state need-based aid either.</TE>
<TE>   Bidding Wars for Stars</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, public and private colleges also are shifting more of
their money into scholarships based solely or partly on merit. Some
experts say it leads to bidding wars for star high school students,
many of them from affluent homes.</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie Mellon University, for example, urges accepted applicants
who have received better aid offers elsewhere to give the Pittsburgh
school a chance to make a counteroffer. Michael Steidel, the school's
director of admissions, said many of the students involved are
financially needy, but he conceded that the median family incomes of
incoming freshmen receiving grants have risen in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   That's also the case at Pomona College in Claremont. The median
income for parents of Pomona students receiving aid from the school
has risen, after taking inflation into account, by 22% in the last
four years, to $69,759. Almost as many students with family incomes
of more than $90,000 receive grants as those from families earning
less than $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Poch, the college's vice president of admissions, said
Pomona modified its aid policy partly because of "screams that the
middle class is finding it rougher and rougher" to pay for college.
The school was concerned that many of the middle-class students it
accepted were drawn away by other schools.</TE>
<TE>   Practices Defended</TE>
<TE>   In defense of their practices, college administrators say they
have a legitimate interest in recruiting students with the top grades
and test scores because they add to their campuses' intellectual
vitality.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, many administrators and high school guidance counselors
say scholarship money remains available for low-income students,
though there is less of it for students who are not academic
standouts. The main barrier for students from poor families, they
contend, is the weak academic preparation they generally receive
before college.</TE>
<TE>   "If I go to a low-income high school and the kids haven't taken
Algebra II or U.S. history and it's senior year, there's not a damn
thing I can do with them, no matter how bright they are," said Pomona
College's Poch.</TE>
<TE>   The experience of Ivy League schools and other prestigious
universities that pledge to meet the full financial needs of admitted
students also shows that it takes more than need-based financial aid
to bring in low- and moderate-income students.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine study found that at Stanford University, for example,
only 10.8% of domestic students in 2000-01 were from families whose
income was low enough to qualify for federal Pell grants. Meanwhile,
the median incomes of the parents of freshmen receiving grants from
Stanford has reached $68,000. That is up about 17% over the last four
years, after adjusting for inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Mamlet, dean of admissions, acknowledged that the school is
giving financial aid to middle-income families "more responsively
than ever." But she insists that the problem is one of recruitment
and of overcoming "an unevenness of opportunity" in the nation's
educational system.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not as successful as we would like to be at reaching out
to low-income students and having them see that Stanford can be an
option for them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert M. Shireman, the Irvine Foundation's higher education
program director, doesn't believe it has to be that way. He cites the
success of other high-caliber schools in California in attracting and
providing financial support for less-affluent students.</TE>
<TE>   "If UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and USC can admit such large
numbers [of lower-income students] and be some of the top
universities in the country, then others should be able to do that
also," he said.</TE>

<HD>Baptist Leader Says Muslims Aren't Enemies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PLANO, Texas</DL>
<LD>The new president of the Southern Baptist Convention, who defended a
pastor's characterization of Islam founder Muhammad as a
"demon-possessed pedophile," told his church congregation Sunday that
the denomination isn't battling Islam.</LD>
<LD>   "Our enemy is Satan, not any other religion," the Rev. Jack Graham
said. "Our issue in life is not Muhammad or any other religious
leader, it's Jesus Christ."</LD>
<LD>   Graham was named last week to a one-year term as the leader of the
nation's largest Protestant denomination during Southern Baptists'
annual meeting in St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   Graham, pastor of massive Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano,
found himself in the middle of a firestorm when former convention
president Jerry Vines told conventioneers that Islam's founder was a
"demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives--and his last one was a
9-year-old girl."</TE>
<TE>   Islamic leaders called the comment outrageous and bigoted, but
Graham declined to condemn his colleague and called Vines' statement
"accurate."</TE>
<TE>   Graham, speaking with reporters after Sunday services, defended
Vines as a pastor who has a record of reaching across racial and
denominational lines.</TE>
<TE>   "God loves Muslim people. Because God loves Muslim people, we do
too," Graham said. "Our desire is to serve them and share in any way
we can our faith with them."</TE>
<TE>   Though he said he regretted the controversial climate in which it
was raised, Graham said he was glad to be involved in a dialogue on
Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Baptists claim more than 16 million members in the United
States, including more than 3 million in Texas.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church Must 'Pick Up the Pieces'</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Back at pulpit after bishops' meeting in Dallas,
New York Cardinal Edward M. Egan tells worshippers, 'This is a harsh
day.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic church needs to pick up the pieces, Cardinal
Edward M. Egan told parishioners Sunday, as bishops returned to their
pulpits after passing a new mandate on dealing with pedophile
priests.</LD>
<LD>   Egan and other church leaders apologized to worshippers for the
clergy's handling of one the worst scandals in U.S. church history.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a harsh day. These are terrible times. And we are all
outraged, scandalized," Egan told parishioners at St. Charles Parish
on Staten Island. "We need to pick up the pieces, and we will."</LD>
<TE>   National guidelines adopted Friday at a landmark bishops
conference in Dallas require church officials to report any
allegation of a minor being abused by clergy and give the
rank-and-file an unprecedented role in policing the church.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia said the Dallas
meeting was "the most painful and difficult" of his 33 years as a
priest.</TE>
<TE>   "Painful though it is, I still support" the policy, Bevilacqua
said during Mass at St. Denis Parish in Havertown, Pa. "I have to
balance my great love for all priests with the common good of the
church."</TE>
<TE>   One aspect of the policy drawing criticism is that, although past
abusers will be stripped of duties, they may remain in the
priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' rights groups have argued that formal defrocking--removal
from the priesthood--is the only acceptable punishment for abusive
priests.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials, however, have questioned whether the plan to
remove abusive priests from church work may be too much, said Bishop
Wilton Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
He said many in the Holy See do not understand the U.S. legal system
and think that church penance is enough.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory said he still was "as confident as I can be" that the
Vatican will approve the policy. The process, which could take
months, is necessary before the policy can become church law in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "They know the seriousness of the matter," Gregory said Sunday on
NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   "They have expressed their overwhelming desire to assist us."</TE>
<TE>   Many bishops returning from the conference said their dioceses
already had adopted sexual abuse guidelines similar to the national
mandate.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico Archbishop Michael Sheehan said Saturday that the
Archdiocese of Santa Fe had served as a model for the national
policy. He expelled 20 priests after he took over there in 1993 amid
a sexual scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "We had here a microcosm in New Mexico of what has taken place
recently in the country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, the epicenter of the controversy, Cardinal Bernard Law
did not appear at Holy Cross Cathedral, as he had not returned from
Dallas and usually spends the summer visiting parishes.</TE>
<TE>   The homily instead was delivered by a priest, Msgr. William H.
Roche, who did not discuss the bishops' meeting or the sexual abuse
scandal. Outside, protesters gathered as they have done since the
scandal broke in January.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't go far enough," said Stephen Lewis, 45, of Lynn,
Mass., who said a priest abused him when he was an 11-year-old altar
boy.</TE>
<TE>   "I want zero tolerance and priests defrocked. We're talking about
a crime."</TE>

<LD>The Home Depot Inc., the nation's largest hardware and

with the U.S. government or its representatives, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported.</LD>
<LD>   The General Services Administration just learned of the policy,
said Susan McIver of the GSA. "Home Depot has not contacted us, so
I've got no idea what their problem is."</LD>
<LD>   As of April, 384,520 government employees were using "GSA Smart
Pay" cards for purchases other than travel or fleet operations,
McIver said.</LD>
<TE>   The notice also says commercial credit-card customers will be
alerted with their June bill that purchases would not be allowed
"that would cause the company to be covered by or responsible in any
way for compliance with" three federal laws or executive orders:

shipments to his state, saying a physical blockade would be illegal
and presents a possible terrorist target.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie issued the order Friday, a day

<LD>The 30th anniversary of Watergate today brings another round of
theories and guesses about the identity of "Deep Throat," but the two
journalists who dealt with the confidential source renewed their
three-decade vow of silence.</LD>
<LD>   "You're going to get a kind of deep silence from us," said
Washington Post writer Bob Woodward. Former White House Counsel John
Dean has a new book, "Unmasking Deep Throat," in which he narrows the

<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush, like many an American father, spent Sunday working in
the yard and doing a little fishing.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike most others, he worked in a couple of telephone chats with
world leaders.</LD>
<LD>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush telephoned Mexican
President Vicente Fox to wish Mexico luck in today's World Cup soccer
match with the United States in South Korea. He said the call lasted
about five minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Bush received a call earlier from Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah,
McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was part of the two leaders' "ongoing consultation on
the Middle East," but he declined to discuss the 10- to 15-minute
conversation further, characterizing it as private.</TE>
<TE>   For Father's Day, the president had his twin daughters, Jenna and
Barbara, 20, with him on the family's remote Texas ranch. But, citing
the girls' privacy, White House aides refused to discuss whatever
holiday treats they had for their dad.</TE>
<TE>   Bush treated himself to a three-mile run on his 1,600 acres, which
were soaked by a ferocious overnight thunderstorm, and a walk with
First Lady Laura Bush.</TE>

<HD>Cloning Receives a Makeover</HD>
<DH>Politics: Nuances of language helped reframe the debate and
derail an all-out ban in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>They were up against some of the most powerful forces in politics:
President Bush, the antiabortion movement and the Roman Catholic
Church. But when patients and scientists set out this year to
preserve human cloning as a legal tool of medical research, their
toughest opponents also included a 24-year-old movie, "The Boys From
Brazil."</LD>
<LD>   The 1978 thriller featured a rogue scientist trying to rebuild the
Nazi movement by cloning Adolf Hitler, and it helped give cloning a
creepy public image. Thanks in part to that image, a total ban on
cloning passed the House last year by a 100-vote margin and seemed on
its way to becoming law.</LD>
<LD>   Today, however, some lawmakers who once denounced cloning have
embraced it as a potential way to cure disease. And last week, the
campaign to ban all human cloning collapsed in the Senate. Supporters
of the ban acknowledged that they were well short of the 60 votes
needed for passage, and they backed out of a debate on the Senate
floor that they had been seeking for months.</LD>
<TE>   Prospects for a total ban are now "substantially, substantially"
reduced, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said, though
they are not dead.</TE>
<TE>   For a small group of lobbyists from the biotechnology industry,
scientific societies and such patient groups as the Juvenile Diabetes
Research Foundation, derailing the effort to ban all cloning has been
a major victory. It was accomplished through many of the traditional
tools of Washington lobbying, including personal appeals to
lawmakers, television advertising and placing opinion pieces in
hometown newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps their most important success was in changing the
perception of cloning among lawmakers. Cloning, in essence, was given
a makeover.</TE>
<TE>   "Cloning is an abstraction, and the battle has been a matter of
trying to fill in that abstraction for the American public and
policy-makers," said David Prentice, a professor of life sciences at
Indiana State University who is advising anti-cloning senators. "If
you can control the terminology, then you control the debate."</TE>
<TE>   From their early organizational meetings in January, supporters of
cloning in research decided to come up with new language to highlight
that cloning could help sick patients. "We were battling a science
fiction genre that had existed for 40 years," said Michael
Manganiello, president of the Coalition for the Advancement of
Medical Research, which led the lobbying campaign in defense of
research cloning. "What do you call this so that it's not seen as
science fiction?"</TE>
<TE>   Two words were particularly problematic. One was "cloning" itself.
The word refers to a range of scientific techniques for making a copy
of something--a cell, an organism, a fragment of DNA.</TE>
<TE>   But to most people, it had come to mean growing a single cell from
a person into a whole new copy of that person, akin to the vision of
"The Boys From Brazil." Adding to the alarm at this type of cloning,
two teams received wide attention in the last year for vowing to
create cloned children. One group is led by an obscure religious
leader who says scientists from another planet told him to start
cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Most disease researchers and patient advocates say they have no
interest in creating children through cloning. Instead, they are
looking for ways to take a cell from a patient's skin or cheek and
transform it into stem cells that might be fashioned into cures for
disease. To accomplish this, the skin or cheek cell would be merged
with an egg cell to create an embryo, which would be dissected at 5
days of age for its stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in Terminology</TE>
<TE>   This technique is often called therapeutic cloning, but many
advocates did not want to use the word "cloning" at all. Adopting
language from scientists, they began calling the technique "somatic
cell nuclear transfer," "nuclear transplantation" or "regenerative
medicine."</TE>
<TE>   In time, some lawmakers began to insist that cloning in medical
research is not even cloning. "It's commonly referred to as
therapeutic cloning, and that's a misnomer," said Sen. Arlen Specter
(R-Pa.) at a May hearing. "It isn't cloning at all."</TE>
<TE>   "There is great misunderstanding in the use of the word 'cloning,'
" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) last week. "I use 'stem cell
research' or 'nuclear transplantation.' "</TE>
<TE>   Another problematic term was "embryo," a word that was
particularly troubling for antiabortion lawmakers. Because they
opposed a woman's right to destroy an embryo during pregnancy, they
faced a hurdle in arguing that scientists should be free to destroy
embryos for their stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   In time, some lawmakers began to argue that an embryo created
through cloning is substantially different from one made through the
traditional merger of egg and sperm.</TE>
<TE>   "I would argue that an embryo has not been created" during the
cloning process, said former Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.), an abortion
opponent whose experience with cancer led him to support research
cloning. "You're using an egg that has never been fertilized by sperm
and is never placed in a uterus. The words that we're using were
defined in a former age."</TE>
<TE>   To cloning opponents, these shifts in language were a kind of
sleight of hand, meant to downplay the idea that cloning destroys a
human embryo. "They're linguistic cloaking devices," said Douglas
Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, cloning opponents were working to paint their
own portrait of the technique. They said cloning would lead to "human
embryo farms," in which human lives would be sacrificed for their
body parts. President Bush adopted some of the same unsettling
language in a White House speech April 10 that urged the Senate to
ban all cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this dark view of cloning, nearly 60 senators support the
idea of preserving the technique in medical research while banning it
as a method of reproduction, Daschle said last week. A measure to ban
all cloning, sponsored by Sens. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) and Mary
Landrieu (D-La.), has support from 42 senators, said Michelle Powers,
an anti-cloning activist.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the Message Out</TE>
<TE>   Why did lawmakers choose one view over the other? People on both
sides of the issue agree that advocates of therapeutic cloning
managed to make more senators feel comfortable about the technique,
even if some constituents remained uneasy with it.</TE>
<TE>   Working with patients around the country, therapeutic cloning
advocates placed more than 30 opinion pieces in newspapers. And
celebrities such as Muhammad Ali and actors Michael J. Fox and
Christopher Reeve testified against a total cloning ban. Forty Nobel
Prize-winning scientists signed a letter in support of the research,
and former President Ford wrote his own letter.</TE>
<TE>   "Their side has done a better job" of getting its message out,
"and especially of lining up big names. They have names that the
public recognizes and respects," Prentice acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Hollywood producers helped sway Sen. Orrin G. Hatch
(R-Utah), whose credentials as a conservative and abortion opponent
made it easier for other antiabortion lawmakers to sign on. The
group, CuresNow, was founded by Jerry Zucker, whose directing credits
include "Airplane!" and "Ghost"; his wife, Janet, a movie producer;
Douglas Wick, producer of "Gladiator"; and his wife, Lucy Fisher,
former vice chairman of Sony Pictures. Both couples have children
with juvenile diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   When the group, CuresNow, agreed to pay for a pro-research ad on
television, in Utah and elsewhere, it assured Hatch that "there were
therapeutic cloning groups willing to aggressively counter the
concerns of his pro-life constituency," said a Democratic Senate
aide. "This raised his comfort level."</TE>
<TE>   Some senators who were skeptical of therapeutic cloning only
months ago eventually became its champions.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle last year had said he was "uncomfortable with even cloning
for research purposes," but this year he engineered parliamentary
maneuvers that have forced Brownback to retreat from a total cloning
ban.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining his change of heart, Daschle said last week: "What I
didn't fully appreciate initially was the tremendous opportunities
scientifically there are with the pursuit of therapeutic
cloning....And many of us have come to the conclusion we should not
only provide that opportunity, we should be encouraging it with
additional research dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle, who controls the Senate calendar, offered Brownback time
last week for a debate and vote on cloning, but under terms that
Brownback said would make it hard to get the 60 votes needed to win.
Brownback is now considering his options, including whether to
propose a two-year moratorium on cloning, rather than a total ban, in
an effort to win more votes.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether the Senate will vote on a separate measure,
sponsored by Hatch, Feinstein and others, that would bar cloning as a
way to produce children but preserve it as a legal technique of
medical research.</TE>

<HD>Forestry Worker Charged in Colorado Fire</HD>
<DH>Arrest: The woman has admitted to accidentally starting the
blaze, say officials. She reportedly had burned a letter from her
estranged husband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Forest Service employee on Sunday was charged with starting a
fire that has burned more than 103,000 acres and destroyed at least
24 homes across four Colorado counties.</LD>
<LD>   Recreation technician Terry Lynn Barton, 38, admitted that she
started a campfire while patrolling Pike National Forest to enforce a
fire ban, said Bill Leone of the U.S. attorney's office here.
Authorities said Barton was burning a letter from her estranged
husband in a rock campfire ring but was unable to suppress the
flames.</LD>
<LD>   Barton was charged with setting fire to timber in a national
forest, damaging federal property in excess of $100,000 and making
false statements to investigators. If convicted, she could be
sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison and fined as much as
$250,000.</LD>
<TE>   Barton--who lives in Teller County south of Denver--has worked
seasonally for the Forest Service for 18 or 19 years, officials said.
She was arrested Sunday morning and is scheduled to make an
appearance in federal court today.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest came as a shock in a state where Forest Service
employees and firefighters have been hailed as heroes for their
efforts to save homes and property in what is becoming the worst fire
season in state history. The Hayman fire, which started June 8, is
the largest ever in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in rural communities and small mountain towns that have
been threatened by fire in the last two months still display handmade
signs: "Thank You Firefighters."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Cables, the regional forest chief for the Forest Service,
made the arrest announcement Sunday at the Hayman fire operation
center, flanked by the assistant U.S. attorney and Gov. Bill Owens.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to begin by saying, this is one of the hardest
announcements I've had to make in my career," Cables said. "I'm
shocked and, with a lot of other people, in a state of disbelief. I'm
saddened to say that one of our employees admitted to starting the
Hayman fire."</TE>
<TE>   Barton had been widely praised last week--although she was not
named--when officials spoke of the Forest Service employee who had
come upon an illegal campfire and valiantly attempted to put it out.</TE>
<TE>   She apparently gave sheriff's deputies the license plate number of
a van that was seen leaving the campsite. The vehicle turned out to
belong to concerned citizens who had spotted the fire and driven over
to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   The Hayman fire has been the nation's highest-priority wildfire
for a week now and was 47% contained Sunday. More than 6,000
residents remain evacuated. Officials say it may take up to three
months to extinguish the blaze, which could cost $50 million to
fight.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of seven major fires raging in the state. The fire
season officially began Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were concerned that a stubborn fire near Durango in
southwest Colorado would force more evacuations. The 20,000-acre fire
in San Juan National Forest consumed two homes on Sunday and forced
the evacuation of two subdivisions about 10 miles north of Durango.
Residents of 450 other homes were told to prepare to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was 25% contained Sunday, but high winds and dry weather
made for difficult firefighting conditions.</TE>

<HD>A Chance for Bush to Take School Reform Global</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>It's deservedly a point of pride for President Bush that the
American-led overthrow of the Taliban made education available to
thousands of young girls in Afghanistan previously barred from
school. "Thanks to the United States and our coalition," he declared
last week, "young girls now go to school for the first time."</LD>
<LD>   Now Bush has a chance to help open the schoolhouse doors on a much
greater scale, for millions of young children denied education in the
developing world.</LD>
<LD>   Next week, Bush and the leaders of the major industrial nations
meeting at the Group of 8 summit in Canada will consider a rising
tide of requests from the World Bank and development advocates for a
new global initiative to expand access to education.</LD>
<TE>   If Bush and his fellow leaders have learned their lessons from
Sept. 11, they'll respond aggressively--out of self-interest as much
as benevolence. The attack didn't impose on America an obligation to
be the world's social worker. But it made painfully apparent that the
discontent bred in failing countries can impose costs far beyond
their borders. And while the priority for the U.S. was to reestablish
fear in those who would do us harm, it's clear that our long-term
security interests are served by expanding opportunity and shrinking
the pool of those open to demagoguery.</TE>
<TE>   Education isn't a foolproof vaccine against extremism; as a group,
the Sept. 11 hijackers were well educated. But expanding access to
education in the developing world, especially in public schools, is
among the most effective tools for teaching tolerance and reinforcing
social stability. As Gennet Zewide, the minister of education in
Ethiopia, put it at a Council on Foreign Relations forum in
Washington last week, education offers developing nations the best
chance "to inculcate in our culture the idea of human rights and
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Expanding access to education offers more tangible benefits as
well, particularly when school is made available to girls as well as
boys. Studies show that more schooling for girls means fewer unwanted
pregnancies, which makes it easier to control population growth.
Likewise, infant mortality rates drop when the mother's education
level rises.</TE>
<TE>   And though increasing the number of children who can read and
write doesn't guarantee that a poor country will grow richer, experts
agree that a lack of education virtually guarantees that poor
countries will stay poor.</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas education is not sufficient to reduce poverty or achieve
economic growth, without education you cannot achieve them," says
Ruth Kagia, the World Bank's education director. Even subsistence
economies benefit from more schooling: One study of 13 nations found
that farm output rises along with average education levels, largely
because literate farmers are more likely to adopt new technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Through the United Nations, the world community in 2000 already
committed to ensuring universal access to primary school education
for boys and girls by 2015. But there's a long way to go. The World
Bank estimates today that a staggering 113 million children ages 6 to
11 are not in school. That's about one-sixth of all school-age
children in the developing world.</TE>
<TE>   Even more discouraging, more than one-fourth of all children in
developing countries fail to complete a primary school education--the
measure of success that experts have come to recognize as the most
meaningful. Given the sluggish progress, the World Bank recently
projected that 89 of the world's 155 countries aren't on track to
reach the 2015 goal of education for all.</TE>
<TE>   Given the payoff, why has the world made so little progress at
moving children into school? The answer is the same tangled knot of
tradition, poverty and mismanagement that explains so many problems
in needy nations. Desperately poor parents need the labor children
provide, not only in the cash economy but at home. Cultural
traditions, especially in rural areas, discourage the education of
girls.</TE>
<TE>   Many countries spend too little on education--India, with a third
of school-age children out of school, and Pakistan, with more than a
quarter, both spend twice as much on defense as education--and charge
parents too much: Even small school fees for books, which are common
in many countries, can become large impediments for families who
barely earn enough to survive. Finally, in many places school quality
is so poor, parents understandably conclude it isn't worth the
sacrifice. "In poor countries, there is school choice," says Gene
Sperling, a former top economic advisor to President Clinton who
directs the Center for Universal Education at the Council on Foreign
Relations. "The choice is, do you go to school at all?"</TE>
<TE>   Amid the undeniable challenges, some encouraging signs are
sprouting. At the forum last week, Zewide and colleagues from Ghana,
Nigeria and Gambia shared promising strategies--such as home loans to
attract better-qualified teachers to rural areas, subsidies to
parents who keep their daughters in school, flexible rules that allow
communities to restructure their school calendar around local labor
needs--that have expanded participation and improved quality.</TE>
<TE>   Such local reforms are probably the key to accelerating progress.
But the developing world also needs more money for books, classrooms
and teachers. The World Bank calculates that meeting the 2015 goal
would require the rich nations to provide about $3 billion more
annually in new education aid.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has broadly urged a greater focus on education in foreign
assistance. But he hasn't signed on to this specific plan, largely
because the administration believes the World Bank wants to subsidize
too many countries that haven't committed to internal reform.</TE>
<TE>   Those are appropriate questions for the administration to ask. But
it would be a mistake for Bush to get lost in these weeds now. The
bureaucracies can negotiate the list of the deserving later. In
Canada, the challenge for Bush is to rally the world as he did in the
war against terrorism--this time for a global campaign to leave no
child behind.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A rabbi suspended plans Sunday to organize armed civilian patrols in
Jewish neighborhoods that were considered terrorist targets after
residents and lawmakers complained.</LD>
<LD>   "The response was so overwhelmingly negative, but God forbid
anything should happen and then I'll have to say 'I told you so,' "
said the rabbi, Yakove Lloyd.</LD>
<LD>   Lloyd, president of the right-wing Jewish Defense Group, had
called a news conference to explain details on his armed patrols. The
patrols had been scheduled to begin Sunday night in Borough Park and
Flatbush.</LD>
<TE>   He promised a crowd of 100 supporters but showed up alone.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd said the armed patrols were conceived in response to
comments that fugitive Abdul Rahman Yasin made during an interview on
television June 2.</TE>
<TE>   Yasin, who is sought by the FBI in the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing, said from Iraq that he and his accomplices originally
targeted heavily Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn.</TE>

<HD>Virtual Trail Led to Serial Killer Suspect</HD>
<DH>Crime: Downloaded map provided officials with a signpost in
deaths of 10 women: a Web address.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The killer stalked the desperate.</LD>
<LD>   He picked up prostitutes frantic to sell their bodies for a hit of
crack--frayed women willing to get in any car for the promise of $20.
He drove them away from their grubby corners, away from any
witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Then he bound them. He tortured them. He murdered them. And he
tossed their bodies, like litter, into the roadside shrubs.</LD>
<TE>   Alysa Greenwade was killed this way. And Teresa Wilson. And Betty
James. Verona Thompson. Yvonne Crues. Brenda Beasley. And four other
African American women yet to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   As the bodies turned up one by one, starting in April 2001,
authorities began to suspect a serial killer was on the prowl. But
leads were scarce.</TE>
<TE>   Then last month, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran a story about one
of the victims--a sympathetic portrait of Teresa Wilson's bruised
life. Within days, reporter Bill Smith got an odd-looking envelope in
the mail.</TE>
<TE>   The American flag stamp was affixed neatly upside down. The return
address cited a masochist Web site devoted to naked women in chains.
Inside, under a bizarre graphic of flowers, rakes and a beehive,
Smith found a chilling note typed in red. "Nice sob story," it read.
"I'll tell you where many others are." And then: "To prove im real
here's directions to number seventeen." A second sheet of paper
contained a map of nearby West Alton, Ill., marked with an X.</TE>
<TE>   Police went to the spot marked by the X. Pushing aside the weeds,
they found a skeleton. A woman's corpse, long since decomposed.</TE>
<TE>   They had their break at last.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, it would prove to be ephemeral. In a case made for
a crime writer, the final twist came last week. One minute,
authorities thought they had their man. The next, they were left
empty-handed--and wondering how many other bodies might be out there
among the roadside trash.</TE>
<TE>   The first step was to track down the source of the West Alton map.
Surfing through travel sites on the Web, Illinois State Police
quickly discovered it had been downloaded from Expedia.com.</TE>
<TE>   Such online browsing can be tracked because each time a computer
user connects to the Internet, he is assigned a unique number, known
as an IP address. Each site he surfs--indeed, each page he looks
at--is recorded in an activity log linked to that number.</TE>
<TE>   "People think their browsing online is anonymous, but all kinds of
people are watching," said Chris Hoofnagle, legislative counsel for
the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Some Web sites delete the IP addresses of their online visitors
within minutes. Others retain activity logs much longer. In this
case, in response to a federal subpoena, Expedia.com was able to pull
up the IP address of every user who had looked at a West Alton map in
recent days.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, there was only one: IP 65.227.106.78. The user
assigned to that number had clicked to zoom in on West Alton 10
times--until the map on his screen looked exactly like the version
sent to the Post-Dispatch.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI subpoenaed the Internet service provider that had assigned
that particular IP address. Some providers delete address information
promptly. But Microsoft Corp. was able to match 65.227.106.78 to a
specific user. A user who was based in St. Louis County. A user by
the name of MSN/maurytravis.</TE>
<TE>   On June 7, the FBI searched the home of Maury Troy Travis, a
36-year-old waiter with a history of armed robbery and drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   They found what appeared to be blood spatters throughout his
suburban home. And in a locked file cabinet, they found several belts
and ligatures--also apparently smeared with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Travis was charged with two federal kidnapping counts for
allegedly taking victims Greenwade and James across state lines.
Authorities said they suspected him in the murders of the six
prostitutes and four unidentified women whose bodies had been
discovered in the St. Louis area from April 2001 through May 2002.
They planned additional charges.</TE>
<TE>   But the grim investigation had not yet taken that final twist.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Travis hanged himself in jail, even as he was under
suicide watch. Finding a spot in his cell that the monitor posted
outside could not see, he managed to thread a noose made from a sheet
through the tiny holes of a mesh vent above his toilet.</TE>
<TE>   He then stuffed toilet paper in his nostrils, put a gag in his
mouth and pulled a pillowcase over his head. Somehow--authorities
said he must have drawn on his skill with sadomasochistic bondage--he
managed to tie his own hands behind his back. Then he put the noose
around his neck and jumped off the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Travis left a suicide note declaring he would rather kill himself
than face execution or life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   He also left some very frustrated investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Travis' DNA is being compared with semen found on two victims.
Tire tracks may link him to two other corpses.</TE>
<TE>   But Travis' death is a huge blow to detectives who had hoped to
connect him to all 10 bodies found--as well as to the attempted
strangulation of an 11th woman, another black prostitute, who
suffered such severe brain damage that she cannot aid the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also had been hoping that Travis might point them
toward undiscovered victims. In his letter to the Post-Dispatch, he
had hinted at killing at least 17.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators lost "a tremendous amount of valuable information,"
said Gene Heckler, the police chief in Columbia, Ill., where one of
the bodies was found.</TE>
<TE>   Still, authorities from several jurisdictions said they would not
close their files with Travis' death. Instead, they vowed to keep
sifting the evidence until they could figure out which corpses, if
any, he was responsible for--and which might be the work of a killer
still at large.</TE>
<TE>   "We still feel confident we will be able to go forward with this
case," said Lt. Terry Remelius of the Illinois State Police.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, Remelius has his hands full with another gruesome
case--of another serial killer who targeted similar victims but left
distinct markings on their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Younge Jr. was charged last week in the killings of three
prostitutes in East St. Louis, Ill., just across the Mississippi
River from St. Louis. He allegedly stuffed their bodies into garbage
bags and dumped them in vacant lots in late 1999 or early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He also is suspected in the death of a fourth woman whose corpse
was found nearby. The investigation is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   So is the prostitution that put so many in danger.</TE>
<TE>   In dingy sweatshirts, hair matted, teeth broken, women craving
another hit of crack hustle the very same streets from which their
friends disappeared. They rest on benches or in cars with burly men,
standing up now and then to wave a car to the corner, bending over
the window to negotiate a price.</TE>
<TE>   "Daytime, nighttime, late night, they're there," said St. Louis
Alderwoman Dionne Flowers, who represents the neighborhood where
Travis probably picked up many of his victims.</TE>
<TE>   They cycle on and off their corners so often that it's hard even
for friends to keep track of them. "We don't know if there are other
women missing," Flowers said. "There are a lot of unanswered
questions."</TE>

<HD>3 Shot in Alleged Attempt to Burn Bar</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A heavily armed man allegedly shot three people and tried to set
patrons at a Manhattan bar on fire Sunday before being wounded by
officers and arrested in what police said was a racially motivated
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Johnson, 34, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
after what Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly described as a "very
bizarre crime by this deranged individual."</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, who is black, was carrying three loaded guns, 153 rounds
of ammunition and a samurai sword when he approached four white
people walking in the East Village and told them: "I have a problem
with you," Kelly said.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson shot one of the men in the upper body, followed him as he
ran to the door of the bar and shot him again, police say. Johnson
then entered the bar and ordered as many as 40 patrons to the
kitchen, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A 54-year-old man of Asian descent who owns a store next to the
bar heard the shots and peeked in, and Johnson shot him in the wrist,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson--who was also carrying a police baton, a bottle of
kerosene, a fireplace lighter and more than 100 plastic
handcuffs--then allegedly forced a woman to start putting flex cuffs
on the hostages while he sprayed the crowd with kerosene and fired
occasional shots at police cars outside.</TE>
<TE>   When Johnson pulled out the lighter, two Manhattan women jumped
him, and he shot one in the leg, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers heard the shots and stormed the bar, grazing Johnson in
the head and taking him into custody.</TE>
<TE>   One victim was hospitalized in serious condition and the other two
were in stable condition. The suspect was in stable condition, police
said.</TE>

<DL>BARROW, Alaska</DL>
<LD>It is the season of the midnight sun and still it's snowing. The
Arctic Ocean looms up against the shore in chunks of jagged ice, the
thermometer has barely reached 26 degrees by noon and the bloody
hunks of whale meat George Ahmaogak has just hauled into town have to
be thawed before his crew can start slicing into them.</LD>
<LD>   This is the time of year--on the lip between the treacherous
Arctic winter and the glorious northern summer--when the bowhead
whales push their bulbous heads through the first narrow wedge that
opens between the polar ice and the shore ice, creating an eerie
symphony of hisses and puffs out in the frozen sea.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmaogak and the other whaling captains climb into their small
sealskin umiaqs and paddle out into the ice channels, hoping to
plunge their harpoons into the tough skin at the back of the
bowhead's brain. The whales thrash and die in the cold sea. Yards and
porches all over Barrow fill up with towering piles of meat and
bones.</LD>
<TE>   It has been more than a thousand years since the bowhead whale
first fed an Eskimo along this stretch of Arctic coast. Such history
made this community one of the few in the world legally able to skirt
the 16-year-old international moratorium on whaling.</TE>
<TE>   But that right was stripped away last month by the International
Whaling Commission. In a political maneuver orchestrated by
Japan--which wants its own exemption for aboriginal whaling--the
commission for the first time rejected a quota for Alaskan and
Russian Eskimos. The decision threatens the livelihood of thousands
of Inupiat residents along Alaska's northern coast, and it sets the
stage for a tough diplomatic contest between the U.S. and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Alaskan whalers have vowed to defy the ban if necessary--a move
that could put the U.S. out of compliance with the international
whaling treaty it has worked for years to uphold around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what's kept these Eskimos alive for a thousand years--all
that blubber," said Ahmaogak, surveying the piles of meat spread
across his yard as a dozen men and women methodically sliced,
stacked, packaged and boxed it for storage in the permafrost
underground. "You ask the elders, and they'd rather die than go
without the whale. Without the whale, I don't think the Eskimo will
survive."</TE>
<TE>   While Native Americans in Washington state have battled
conservationists and engaged in high-profile court fights over their
recent attempts to hunt gray whales in the Pacific, Alaska's Eskimos
for years have quietly hunted the bowhead.</TE>
<TE>   The international community for the most part has accepted the
principle that aboriginal peoples in places such as Alaska, Siberia,
Greenland and the Caribbean are entitled to harvest a small number of
whales each year for subsistence purposes, carrying on ancient
cultural traditions that could be lost without the seasonal hunts.</TE>
<TE>   In the Alaskan Arctic, the bowhead whale--from steaks to organ
stews to mikigaq (a gooey, fermented soup of whale skin and tongue
considered to be a delicacy)--makes up well over half of many
families' diets in a region with few cheap alternatives. With all
outside supplies brought in by barge or plane, beef rib steaks cost
$7.68 a pound.</TE>
<TE>   "To understand what subsistence is, you have to come up here when
it's 70 below and see what it takes to survive in this stuff," said
Ahmaogak, who is mayor of the North Slope borough here.</TE>
<TE>   "You have all these people who say, 'I'm a vegetarian,' and they
get up here and complain about cold feet and cold hands and we're not
even 10 minutes outside the door," he said. "A T-bone steak will only
last an hour and a half, and then you're hungry again. This stuff
sticks to your ribs for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Under the aboriginal provisions of the international whaling
treaty, Alaskan and Siberian Eskimos since 1978 have shared a
subsistence quota that, in recent years, has allowed them to harpoon
67 whales a year--mostly in Alaska. Because part of the quota can
carry over from one year to the next, this year's limit is 75 whales.</TE>
<TE>   The current five-year authorization expires after this fall's
hunt. But when the U.S. moved to renew it at last month's meeting of
the whaling commission, the Japanese delegation balked. Approval
requires a three-fourths majority of the 48 member countries. The
vote fell one short, thanks to Japan winning the support of delegates
from Norway, the Solomon Islands, Mongolia and several Caribbean
nations.</TE>
<TE>   The real issue was not Alaska whaling, but Japan's
long-unsuccessful petition to conduct its own aboriginal whaling of
50 minke whales. (Japan already takes about 560 whales a year for
what is described as a scientific program.) The U.S. has been
influential in opposing that proposal, saying it is an apparent
attempt to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of aboriginal
whaling. The move against the Alaska quota, U.S. officials believe,
was an attempt at counter-pressure from Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Japan admitted as much.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coastal whaling bid has been rejected for 15 years. The
United States ought to feel the same pain," Masayuki Komatsu, a
senior official of Japan's Fisheries Agency, told the Japanese
newspaper Asahi Shimbun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really tragic what's occurred," Rolland Schmitten, the head
of the U.S. delegation, said in an interview. "Because the [Alaska
whalers] are truly the IWC's model organization for aboriginal
subsistence hunting. They have collected more science than likely all
the nations involved in the IWC, they have observed the rules,
they've played exactly the game that the IWC has asked of them for 25
years. So for them to be caught up in a political issue is grossly
unfair."</TE>
<TE>   The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission has gathered a wealth of
scientific data in recent years demonstrating that the bowhead
population, considered endangered around the world, actually is
growing in the seas near Siberia and Alaska by 3.2% a year--a rate
that could sustain as many as 102 strikes annually. Last year, a
total of 75 whales were struck and 49 were landed, all but one of
them in Alaska. The number of calves passing by Point Barrow--the
long spit of sand that represents the northernmost spot in
America--was 9,860 in 2001, about twice the number counted in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Oil money from nearby Prudhoe Bay has made Barrow one of Alaska's
richest native communities--Ahmaogak drives around town in a Hummer,
and big, new pickups are parked in many driveways. But whaling
remains a crucial economic and cultural asset.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, natives from all over northern Alaska will
travel here--along with planeloads of tourists--for Barrow's annual
whale harvest festival. Many of them will pay Joe Schults $60 for a
4-wheel drive excursion out to Point Barrow to see the piles of
discarded whale bones--rising like low, sculptured mountains on the
horizon--a favorite grazing spot for polar bears. Then they'll
probably stop for lunch at the restaurant he runs with his mother,
Pepe's North of the Border, billed as the northernmost Mexican
restaurant in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But today, Schults' T-shirt seems to reflect the sense of unease
that has settled over town. "Due to budget cuts," it says, "the light
at the end of the tunnel has been turned off."</TE>
<TE>   This spring, it's not only the whaling commission that's causing
problems.</TE>
<TE>   A gradual warming in the Alaskan Arctic in recent years has caused
an earlier than usual bowhead migration and thin and shifting ice
conditions. The result is fewer whales struck and even fewer landed,
because it becomes difficult and dangerous to drag them up onto the
ice.</TE>
<TE>   "The sea ice conditions have not been right, for whatever reason.
It's never thawed out this much this early, at least not in my
lifetime," said Arnold Brower Jr., a third-generation whaling captain
and tribal president of the Inupiat villages of the Arctic slope.</TE>
<TE>   In late May, 58 hunters were stranded on giant ice sheets that
began floating out to sea when large cracks opened up shortly after
midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody yelled that the ice had shifted out, and everybody
panicked. They all got on their snow machines and tried to go back.
Two kids made it across [by jumping], but they had to leave their two
snow machines behind," said one of the hunters, Solomon Elavgak. The
rest of the group had to be rescued by helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the difficult ice conditions, Barrow's 42 whaling
captains have landed only three whales in the season that is now
winding down. (Three others have been brought in elsewhere on the
coast.) In a good year, 17 or 18 whales would have been caught by
now. The poor season "changes everything," said Brower, who harpooned
a 38-foot female this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, we're going to have to depend more on caribou, ducks and
geese. Fishing."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they have launched diplomatic efforts to
persuade Japan to change its position. If that fails, the U.S.
delegation has several options, including filing objections to the
IWC decision, seeking an intercessional meeting to reconsider, or
unilaterally allowing the Alaskans to proceed under a domestic
management regime--an option that would allow the hunt to proceed but
technically could put the U.S. in violation of the international
whaling agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall goal is that the Alaskan natives and we agree that
we'd like to stay underneath the auspices of the IWC. They're used to
working under the IWC, they play a big role in the IWC, and it gives
them extra legal security, being under both an international and a
national management plan," said Schmitten, the U.S. delegate.</TE>
<TE>   But the sentiment in Barrow doesn't lean toward compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should I let these people who don't understand my life govern
how I feed my family?" Brower asked. "Why should I have to go to the
international arena and explain how I make my living?"</TE>
<TE>   Ahmaogak said the Eskimos are willing to wait for a deal. But only
to a point. "If all else fails, we'll go into domestic management,"
he said. "We're going to resume whaling, no matter what."</TE>

<LD>   Question: What is in the little packets that are often found in
electronic components, drugs and so forth? Is it harmful?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: The packets contain a drying agent called silica gel. It
is used to absorb any water vapor that leaks into the package,
preventing the water from damaging the contents. Water vapor reaching
electronic components can cause erosion, for example, shortening
their life span.</TE>
<TE>   Silica gel is a porous form of silicon dioxide--effectively, it is
sand. It can absorb about 40% of its own weight in water and can
significantly reduce the relative humidity in a closed container.</TE>
<TE>   It is harmless to eat because it passes through the digestive
system untouched.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A newly discovered cluster of asteroids formed 5.8 million years ago
could provide important clues about the origins of the solar system,
scientists reported in Thursday's issue of Nature. Astronomers at
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., discovered the family
of 39 asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and for
the first time used a computer model to accurately date when they
were formed.</LD>
<LD>   At 5.8 million years old, the family is the youngest known
asteroid cluster in the 4.5-billion-year lifetime of the solar
system. Others are hundreds of millions of years old. The cluster,
formed when an asteroid 15 miles in diameter was struck by a smaller
object, could help answer questions about what happens when asteroids
break up and whether one on course for a collision with Earth could
be diverted.</LD>

<LD>Applying an antibiotic to the nose of a surgery patient can often
sharply reduce the risk of developing a nasty wound infection on
other areas of the body, according to research in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine. Doctors discovered years ago that if
surgery patients harbored the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in
their nasal cavities, their risk of developing a wound infection was
up to nine times greater than those who did not carry the germ in
their noses. Treating such infections costs between $5 billion and
$10 billion annually in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Johns Hopkins University researchers reported that applying the
antibiotic mupirocin to eliminate the bacteria from the noses of
surgery patients could cut the risk of wound infection nearly in
half.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Trish Perl of Hopkins said the findings "carry tremendous
implications" for preventing illnesses and hospital infections.</LD>

about half the normal risk of dying at any given age. Brothers had a
similarly low risk, except during the teen years and early adulthood.</LD>

<DH>Geology: Using seismic sensors, scientists are getting a
better look at 'superplumes,' which are behind why Earth is shaped
the way it is.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A massive blob of heated rock is rising beneath Africa, pushing the
huge continent upward as if it were a floating cork.</LD>
<LD>   Across the globe, beneath the Pacific, another monster seethes.
This one poured out so much lava in a massive burp 120 million years
ago that it raised the ocean floor by a mile and a half.</LD>
<LD>   What is causing these strange dips and swells, these huge, odd
bulges in the Earth? "It's really one of the grand mysteries of
geology," said Michael Gurnis, a Caltech geophysicist who has spent
two decades studying the Earth's interior.</LD>
<TE>   Now, through the use of a global network of seismic sensors and
high-powered computers, scientists are focusing on one possible
explanation: "superplumes"--rising, continent-size bubbles of
scalding rock so massive they make the volcanic plumes creating
Iceland and Hawaii look like dripping faucets.</TE>
<TE>   By tracking earthquake waves as they travel through the Earth,
scientists have been able to peer deeper and with far greater detail
into the innards of the planet--a kind of geological CT scan.
Earthquake waves travel differently through areas of different
temperature and pressure. They slow in hotter, less dense materials
and speed up in cold, dense rock. Some pass through molten rock;
others do not.</TE>
<TE>   The latest scans have provided the sharpest pictures yet of the
strange structures lurking beneath Africa. They reveal a rising
column of rock stretching over thousands of miles and reaching to the
planet's core.</TE>
<TE>   The structures are so large that their existence could recast some
basic aspects of geology. Not only do they explain why the Earth is
shaped the way it is, they also could help geologists better
understand the beating heart of the planet: the heat engine that
fuels the shifting plates on the surface that build mountains, shake
cities during earthquakes and uncork volcanic flows.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful as it is, the brute geological force of plate tectonics
cannot explain all of the Earth's ups and downs, and why the
continental crust under Africa is so much hotter and higher than it
should be. The superplumes also may help explain how planets without
tectonics, such as Mars and Venus, spawn massive volcanoes.</TE>
<TE>   But the closer they look, the stranger superplumes get.</TE>
<TE>   One of the newest snapshots, published this month in the journal
Science, shows that the African superplume is not an amorphous blob
but has surprisingly sharp edges.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that it's almost like a wall really was quite different
than what we expected," said Gurnis, who co-wrote the paper with
Donald Helmberger, who is the director of Caltech's seismological
laboratory, staff scientist Sidao Ni and graduate student Eh Tan.</TE>
<TE>   Although scientists don't know for sure, the sharp sides suggest
that the plume is not merely made of hotter material but may be an
entirely different type of rock surging its way to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Is it left over from the origin of the Earth? A byproduct of plate
tectonics? A result of violent interactions between the metallic core
and the rocky mantle?</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, we really don't know what it is," Gurnis
said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that such colossal objects could go so long without being
well described illustrates just how shallow our knowledge of the deep
Earth remains. "Right now we know embarrassingly little about why the
plates are doing what they're doing," Helmberger said. "We haven't
progressed beyond the cartoon stage."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that even now there is no way to peel back the
Earth's skin and look through the 4,000 miles of rock and metal
layers below. "It's not easy knowing all this from being so far
away," Helmberger said.</TE>
<TE>   The seismic method for scanning the Earth's interior has been used
for a century. Early results were too crude to provide much in the
way of detail. For years, many findings were derided as "fuzzy
business" and attacked as artifacts--byproducts of the complex
statistical work used to analyze the results.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, an expanded network of global seismic
stations has helped cut through the fog, although scientists still
have to wait for earthquakes to occur in just the right spots. "In
medical tomography, you put sensors all over," said Barbara
Romanowicz, director of UC Berkeley's seismological lab. "We
sometimes wait decades for an appropriate data set."</TE>
<TE>   It can be worth the wait. In April, Romanowicz and graduate
student Yuancheng Gung published a paper in Science suggesting that
the structure under Africa was a coherent superplume. Previous work
had shown a structure deep within the Earth and one near the surface
but could not prove they were the same body.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the resolution is not that great, [seismic snapshots
are] giving us a clearer picture," Romanowicz said.</TE>
<TE>   The images however, still are not clear enough to resolve the
controversies concerning these stone behemoths of the deep.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Schubert, an expert on planetary interiors who chairs the
department of Earth and space sciences at UCLA, remains skeptical
about whether the "super-size structures" exist.</TE>
<TE>   While he lauds the work of the seismic imagers, he thinks the hot
regions that have been detected could be caused by something else,
such as a cluster of many smaller plumes. He added that there is no
way to tell if the rock is rising, and he questions those who see the
superplumes as powerful sculptors of the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in mantle plumes," he said. "I'm not so sure I believe
in what you'd call a superplume."</TE>
<TE>   Kent C. Condie, a geochemist at the New Mexico Institute of Mining
and Technology, also disputed the interpretation of the pictures as
superplumes. Condie, the author of "Mantle Plumes and Their Record in
Earth History," said the so-called superplumes do not have the
characteristic wide-headed, thin-tailed shape of geological plumes.</TE>
<TE>   They probably are simple upwellings, he said, large areas of
rising rock that are a normal result of convection in the planet's
hot interior. The implication is that they would be a largely benign
force.</TE>
<TE>   Even Romanowicz concedes that superplumes may not turn out to be
so super after all. "A big debate in the community is whether all
plumes are created equal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But there is evidence beyond our planet weighing in favor of some
massive force beyond the twisting and shifting of surface plates. The
evidence? Olympus Mons on Mars, the largest volcano in the solar
system. Plate tectonics couldn't have created the volcano--the size
of Arizona--because Mars has no moving plates. Victor Baker, a
planetary scientist at the University of Arizona thinks the volcano
could be born of a Martian superplume.</TE>
<TE>   Venus is another planet covered with a scarred and volatile
volcanic surface. Scientists who examined the planet by radar in the
early 1990s were stunned to discover that it too had no plate
tectonics. "This was a surprise. It made people think of plumes,"
Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   The strange activity on our neighbor planets suggest there may be
more than one way to sculpt a planet.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe plate tectonics isn't the final answer in understanding how
our planet behaves," Baker said.</TE>

<HD>Mickelson 32 Going on 40</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>It was both Father's Day and Phil Mickelson's 32nd birthday Sunday,
so he has plenty to be grateful for. He has a beautiful wife, two
lovely daughters, millions of dollars in the bank, three houses, one
jet airplane and 20 victories.</LD>
<LD>   No major titles, mind you, but nobody's perfect. There were a
bunch of players who lined up to trip Tiger Woods on his march toward
the U.S. Open title at Bethpage Black, but Mickelson was the only one
who came close.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, whatever Mickelson had, it wasn't enough. It's never
enough, we have learned, now that Mickelson's streak without a major
title has reached 40.</LD>
<TE>   It would be safe to say that in any sport, when a top player goes
0 for 40 it's considered a slump ... either that or a trend.</TE>
<TE>   Woods began the day with a four-shot lead, bogeyed two of the last
three holes and still won by three shots. At least it was a good show
for a while, when Mickelson two-putted for a birdie at the 13th and
moved within two shots of Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Then as the soggy 102nd U.S. Open came to its end and the
flashbulbs lighted up the growing darkness at the 18th green, Woods
accepted the U.S. Open trophy for the second time. Standing behind
him was Mickelson, the guy with the blue shirt and visor and the
frozen smile, positioned comfortably in the background once again,
like some sort of stage prop.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he was thinking about his closing round of even-par 70 that
meant he still couldn't catch Woods, despite Tiger's two-over 72, his
worst of the week.</TE>
<TE>   The flashbulbs kept lighting the faces on the green. Mickelson
stood still. He was second. It's beginning to look as if he might
just be a second-place guy.</TE>
<TE>   At least second is a familiar position for Mickelson, it not a
particularly pleasant one. He has been runner-up in three majors,
second to Payne Stewart in the 1999 U.S. Open, second to Woods in
last year's PGA Championship and now second to Woods again, and in
the U.S. Open again.</TE>
<TE>   If you're Mickelson, at some point you just have to step back and
give thanks for whatever is on your side of the ledger.</TE>
<TE>   He has good health, one of the sweetest short games out there,
loads of charisma and more than $20 million in earnings in his
career. He is one of the most successful golfers in history, given
the fact that only one player has won more. It's Woods, of course,
who passed the $30-million mark with his victory Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in his and Mickelson's relatively young careers,
Woods still is putting some distance between himself and the field.
But what happened at Bethpage Black this week may actually vault
Mickelson to the vacant position of chief rival to Woods. Hey,
somebody has to do it, might as well be Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   Woods continues to pile up victories (he has 32), major
championships (eight), money ($30,246,327) and has further extended
his dominance, which is what you have to call it when you've won six
of the last eight majors and seven of the last 11.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, meanwhile, continues to add to his reputation as
somebody who has never won the big one. Whether that bothers him
depends on his mood, although the sound bite he offers now is that
he's OK with it, that he'll get one, that his time is going to come.</TE>
<TE>   There is some substance to the Mickelson position. Nick Price won
all three of his majors after he was 32. Gary Player won five of his
nine majors after his 32nd birthday, and Jack Nicklaus won nine of
his 18 major titles after he turned 32. Most golfers believe they
mature in their mid-30s, so that has to be good news for Mickelson,
who seemed to handle his latest setback with graceful acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it, what could he do? Only one player shot better than
him over 72 holes at the demanding Bethpage Black and it was Woods.
The only player Mickelson didn't beat was the No. 1 player in the
world. The only player who shot under par was Woods.</TE>
<TE>   And from 10 shots back Saturday to within two shots of Woods early
Sunday, Mickelson was the only one who made any kind of a move on the
leader.</TE>
<TE>   The challengers dropped out, one by one. Sergio Garcia faltered to
a 74. Padraig Harrington had a 75 and Jeff Maggert a 72. Woods even
gave his peers an opening when he three-putted the first two holes
for bogeys, but only Mickelson stepped up, even a little. That had to
be a good sign for the guy doing the chasing.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has reached the halfway mark of the Grand Slam, with the
British Open coming up next month at Muirfield in Scotland and then
the PGA Championship at Hazeltine in August, so Tiger is looking at
making major history. The only player to win all four majors in one
year is Bobby Jones, 72 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mickelson has his own targets. He would like to make
some history of his own in a major, win the big one, end his streak.
Then it would be somebody else's turn to finish second.</TE>

<LD>George Carlin, appearing on HBO's "On the Record With Bob Costas,"
recalled his reaction when Bobby Thomson hit the home run that gave
the New York Giants the National League pennant over the comedian's
beloved Brooklyn Dodgers in 1951:</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sitting at home listening on a little red Crosley radio and I
had my cat in my hand, a little kitten. I love animals and I am not
cruel to them at all, but when Bobby Thomson hit that home run and I
heard Russ Hodges describing it, I tossed the cat.</LD>
<LD>   "I looked over and saw him heading for the window. An open window,
a three-story drop. Fortunately the curtains were there. He grabbed
the curtains, he swung out over the yard, he saw the yard, he swung
back in and I went and got him."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was on deck when Thomson homered?</TE>
<TE>   Losing their head: Shortstop Ramon Santiago, recently recalled by
the Detroit Tigers, led off two consecutive games with home runs. But
the second one landed in the Tigers' bullpen, on top of the
relievers' good-luck charm, a bobble-head doll of Detroit pitcher
Matt Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "They called the dugout and asked for a trainer," Manager Luis
Pujols told Danny Knobler of Booth Newspapers. The Tigers lost their
next six games.</TE>
<TE>   Ringing endorsement: Drew Bledsoe appears to be comfortable as a
member of the Buffalo Bills. The quarterback recently had a friend
pick up his Super Bowl ring from the New England Patriots but doesn't
plan to wear it.</TE>
<TE>   "That'll be a good thing to have," Bledsoe said. "But I'll be more
proud of the one that we win here.... That one will mean more to me."</TE>
<TE>   Rings, Part II: The 1990 Final Four ring of former Arkansas
basketball player Ron Huery was sold on EBay.com for $1,500 to help
Huery get a driver's license and put his life back together.</TE>
<TE>   Mark McEntire, president of the Memphis-East Arkansas Razorback
Club, bought the ring from Huery for $250 and sold it with his
consent. McEntire told Phil Stukenborg of the Memphis Commercial
Appeal that he's using the money to help pay the $3,000 in fines and
interest Huery owes the city of Memphis stemming from 1991 traffic
violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think [helping Huery] is the right thing to do," McEntire
said.</TE>
<TE>   Follow the smell: A Bucky Badger costume was recently stolen at
Wisconsin, but a school spokesman said it shouldn't be difficult to
find the mascot's togs: "[It has] a unique odor by the end of the
semester."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Willie Mays, who was a rookie with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The World Cup has been full of great acting by
flopping players, says Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune:</TE>
<TE>   "[You] might notice some performances in the World Cup that would
make Shakespeare drop his quill. Forget Olivier and Finney and
O'Toole and the Barrymores and the Hepburns and Bogart and Stewart
and Cagney and all the rest of the finest thespians we have known.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer players are better than actors. Soccer players are the
greatest actors, certainly in sports, and perhaps the greatest ever.
They should call every half of a soccer match an 'act.' Russian plays
have more laughs."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Deal With the Heat</HD>
<DH>Baseball: L.A. rallies to beat Angels, 5-4, in game marked
by bench-clearing incident in the seventh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's on.</LD>
<LD>   The facade of civility between the two local baseball teams
cracked a bit Sunday. The Dodgers and Angels were one more nasty
remark from coming to blows. Mike Scioscia, the long-beloved Dodger
catcher and now the Angel manager, was ejected and booed off the
field he called home for 13 years. The rematch: June 28-30 at Edison
Field.</LD>
<LD>   The standings did not change over the weekend, but the temperature
of the rivalry may have. The Dodgers beat the Angels on Sunday, 5-4,
so the Dodgers remained one game behind the Arizona Diamondbacks in
the National League West and the Angels one behind the Seattle
Mariners in the AL West.</LD>
<TE>   And when the Angels' Dennis Cook hit the Dodgers' Shawn Green with
a pitch Sunday, angering the Dodger players and a sellout crowd of
52,183 at Dodger Stadium and triggering a bench-clearing gathering on
the field, the seeds of a bitter rivalry may have been planted.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels messed with Green, and at least some of the Dodgers
didn't want to hear explanations, not after Green hit two home runs
Friday, two more Saturday and two doubles Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had rallied from a 4-1 deficit, tying the score in the
sixth inning on back-to-back home runs from Eric Karros and Marquis
Grissom. In the seventh, after Mark Grudzielanek singled home what
would become the winning run off embattled Angel reliever Al Levine,
Cook took the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Cook's first pitch to Green hit Green in the back, and the two men
glared at each other. As Green walked to first base, Cook walked
toward him, to offer an apology.</TE>
<TE>   Said Green: "By walking over there, I thought he wanted to start
something."The Dodger right fielder later acknowledged that Cook
"probably" didn't throw at him intentionally, but the Dodgers were
suspicious enough, what with the Angels seemingly unable to confine
Green to first base any other way and with Cook using a sidearm
delivery the Dodgers swore they had never seen from him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very interesting arm angle from Dennis Cook," Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Karros, of his former Dodger teammate Cook: "I've never seen
him drop down like that, never."</TE>
<TE>   Cook denied any intent to hit Green, saying: "Whatever they think
over there, they can think. But I've never hit a guy for doing his
job, and I never will."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia, who said, "There was obviously no intent," soon had his
own troubles. After Cook approached Green, and the two started
yelling at each other, the benches and bullpens emptied, for a round
of shoving and hollering.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start walking in the direction of one of our players,
we're not going to sit there and watch," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Order was quickly restored, and Cook returned to the mound.
According to Scioscia, several Dodger players resumed heckling Cook,
who told them to go back to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, two umpires are jumping in Dennis' face,"
Scioscia said. "I had a problem with that, and I let them know."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia told the umpires they should tell the Dodgers to shut up.
Instead, home plate umpire Gary Darling ejected Scioscia, the first
ejection for the Angel manager this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Scioscia was telling me how to do my job," Darling said.</TE>
<TE>   That no players were ejected, or subject to suspension, was a
relief to both teams. The Angels stumbled to a 6-14 start this
season, in part because infielders Scott Spiezio and Troy Glaus were
suspended for a total of seven games because of a spring training
brawl with the San Diego Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, when the Dodgers' Chan Ho Park delivered a
karate-style kick to the Angels' Tim Belcher, a heated rivalry did
not ensue.</TE>
<TE>   This time?</TE>
<TE>   Check back in two weeks.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Tiptoeing Through Hell: Playing the U.S. Open on Golf's
Most Treacherous Courses"</LD>
<TE>   Author: John Strege</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: HarperCollins, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hogan, it turns out some 50 years later, was wrong. After
shooting a memorable final round of 67 at Oakland Hills to win the
1951 U.S. Open, Hogan said he had tamed "the monster." Oakland Hills,
perhaps. But in John Strege's words, the real beast, the United
States Golf Assn., was just getting started.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, the USGA made its first effort at setting up its Open
courses to rigorously defend themselves against assaults on par. It
was Hogan who inspired the change with his victory at Riviera in
1948, when he shot 276, breaking the Open scoring record by five
strokes. This was accomplished with the Riviera rough trimmed to
three inches, a virtual putting surface compared to the condition of
the roughs that would follow.</TE>
<TE>   The USGA is the obvious and easy target for Strege as he examines
its strategies for tweaking the Open courses: pinching fairways,
leaving rough to grow untended and drying out greens. It is a
combination that has given the USGA its intended result. Winning
scores have routinely soared over the last 51 years. In 1963, Julius
Boros won a three-way playoff achieved after 72-hole totals of nine
over par.</TE>
<TE>   The torturous nature of the courses makes for a colorful and long
list of jabs.</TE>
<TE>   Art Wall: "The Open is the World Series of golf, and the baseball
people don't put rocks in the infield at the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   And from late Times columnist Jim Murray: "Playing in the U.S.
Open is not a privilege, it's a penance."</TE>
<TE>   Strege efficiently weaves through the Open's battered history and
brings it to the doorstep of Bethpage, site of the 2002 event won
Sunday by Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sam Snead, who won seven major titles but never a U.S. Open:
"Everybody cusses the Open. Then they can't wait to qualify the next
year."</TE>

<HD>Kenseth Picks Up His Third Victory</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Kenseth became the first three-time winner of the NASCAR season,
holding off a furious charge from Dale Jarrett in the Sirius
Satellite Radio 400 on Sunday at Brooklyn, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   By winning at Michigan International Speedway, Kenseth gave car
owner Jack Roush a win at his home track. Roush, who survived an
April plane crash, is recovering from his injuries in Michigan and
was at the track on crutches to watch his four cars.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just great to give Jack a win here," Kenseth said. "This is
home, this is his favorite track and he's been through a lot so far
this year. This helps."</LD>
<TE>   Kenseth, who also won in Rockingham, N.C., and Texas, had to
overcome a late red-flag period and battles with rookies Jimmie
Johnson and Ryan Newman before his last-lap duel with Jarrett.</TE>
<TE>   Newman was third, followed by Michael Waltrip and Jeff Gordon, the
defending race champion who came back from a lap down earlier in the
race. Series points leader Sterling Marlin finished 21st. He has a
110-point lead over Gordon and Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Todd Bodine's decision to stay and finish a rain-delayed Busch
event in Kentucky rather than head for the Winston Cup race in
Michigan paid huge dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Bodine took the lead with 10 laps to go and survived a
high-contact, side-to-side duel to the line with Greg Biffle to win
the Kroger 300 at Lexington.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Bodine's 14th on the Busch Series, and first since
Las Vegas in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Raines finished third, followed by pole-sitter Scott Riggs,
Scott Wimmer and Jamie McMurray.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta won his third CART race of the season, holding
off Bruno Junqueira in the G.I. Joe's 200 at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta, who drives for Newman-Haas, has won five of the last
eight races dating to last season.</TE>
<TE>   Target-Ganassi's Junqueira, who was born in the same Brazilian
town as Da Matta, finished 0.625 of a second behind the winner, while
Kool Green's Dario Franchitti was third, 7.761 seconds back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gil de Ferran led all but eight laps to post his first Indy Racing
League victory in the Radisson 225, a race that was stopped for 51
minutes by rain and hail at Fountain, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran and Penske teammate Helio Castroneves repeated their 1-2
finish in qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran finished 1.4 seconds ahead of Castroneves, winner of the
last two Indy 500s, and two seconds ahead of Sam Hornish Jr.</TE>

<TE>   Audi swept the top three places in the 24 Hours of Le Mans at Le
Mans, France, as Frank Biela, Tom Kristensen and Emanuele Pirro
became the first trio to win the event three years running.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in second place, Biela, Kristensen and Pirro took the
lead after three hours and remained in front until the end.</TE>

<TE>   Larry Dixon raced to his seventh top fuel victory of the year and
teammate Ron Capps broke a season-long funny car drought in the

<TE>   Cosworth will manufacture engines exclusively for the CART series
over the next two years in a move to control costs for the racing
teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Ford-owned company will sell 100 turbocharged engines to CART,
which will then lease them to the teams at an annual cost of just
over $1 million per car. The going rate is about $3.5 million.</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Gets a Hat Trick With Win Over Henman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt won his third consecutive Queen's Club
grass-court championship, coming from behind to defeat Tim Henman,
4-6, 6-1, 6-4, at London.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt, the world's No. 1 player, is the first to win three
straight Queen's Club titles since John McEnroe completed the feat in
1981.</LD>
<LD>   The rematch of last year's final was Hewitt's fifth consecutive
victory over Henman.</LD>
<TE>   "To win it three times is incredible. To walk inside the club and
see all the pictures of the past champions and to have my name up
there with all those great players is a great honor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long way from Adelaide [Australia], but I almost feel at
home here. It's always tough coming here straight off the clay but I
find my footing here so quickly. To play Tim, one of the best
grass-court players in the world, in the final, is great preparation
for Wimbledon."</TE>
<TE>   Henman appeared unsure whether to attack or rally from the
baseline on several points, trying both with varying degrees of
success. He was often tentative on his volleys and made far too many
unforced errors to threaten Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give credit to Lleyton. He's certainly tough to play
against on any surface and he proved again why he's the best in the
world," Henman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yevgeny Kafelnikov rallied to win the Gerry Weber Open for the
third time, ending the upset run of Nicolas Kiefer, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, at
Halle, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Kafelnikov nearly was forced to quit with a foot injury he has had
since May. It won't cause him to sit out Wimbledon, which starts next
week.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me I was very close to retiring, the foot was very
painful, but I didn't want to spoil it for the spectators,"
Kafelnikov said. "I wasn't thinking about the result anymore, but
then I started playing better. It's ironic."</TE>
<TE>   Kafelnikov, a two-time Grand Slam winner mired in one of the worst
slumps of his career, needed only two hours to beat Kiefer.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had a great season. It was very wise for me to come to
this tournament," Kafelnikov said. "It brings back some good
memories."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Jelena Dokic won her first grass-court title when she
beat sixth-seeded Anastasia Myskina, 6-2, 6-3, in the DFS Classic
final at Birmingham, England.... Anna Smashnova defeated defending
champion Iroda Tulyaganova, 6-4, 6-1, to win the Wien Energie Grand
Prix at Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Martina Navratilova will play her first singles match in eight
years today against Tatiana Panova at the Wimbledon warmup tournament
in Eastbourne, England.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of 167 singles and 166 doubles titles, the 45-year-old
Navratilova asked for a wild card into the event where she was an
11-time champion. It was granted when organizers failed to attract
Jennifer Capriati or Monica Seles.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova last played singles at a WTA Tour event in 1994, but
has played doubles since 2000. She has insisted for years she had no
interest in playing singles, because it would take too much effort to
get in shape.</TE>

<TE>   The Sanex WTA Tour, the governing body for women's professional

<TE>   Crystal Robinson made two free throws with 11 seconds left as the
New York Liberty (7-3) beat the Charlotte Sting, 54-53, in a WNBA
game before 13,231 at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   The Sting (3-5) had a chance to win, but Andrea Stinson's baseline
jumper hit the side of the backboard. Charlotte Smith then missed a
shot at the buzzer. Dawn Staley's two free throws gave Charlotte a
53-52 lead with 34 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Marty McSorley, whose NHL career ended in a one-year suspension
for hitting an opponent in the head with his stick, was hired as
coach of the Phoenix Coyotes' top farm club.</TE>
<TE>   McSorley was picked to lead the Springfield Falcons of the
American Hockey League after a 17-year NHL career in which his
penalty minutes (3,381) outnumbered his points (359).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott Volkers, the Australian swimming coach who trained Olympic
gold medalist Susie O'Neill, pleaded innocent to sex charges.</TE>
<TE>   The 43-year-old Volkers faces nine counts of indecently touching
three swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   Volkers was initially charged with five counts of indecently
touching two swimmers, then aged 12 and 14, in 1985 and 1987. A third
swimmer has since come forward, alleging she was indecently touched,
leading to four new charges.</TE>

<TE>   Frankie Fredericks of Namibia swept the sprints in the Meeting du
Nord track and field meet at Villeneuve D'Ascq, France, winning the
100 meters in 10.14 seconds and the 200 in 20.07.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Svetlana Feofanova broke her European outdoor pole vault
record, clearing 15-7 1/4. She set the previous mark of 15-7 last
year in the World Championships in Edmonton, Canada. Stacy Dragila of
the U.S. holds the world record of 15-9 1/4.</TE>

<TE>   Jose Bonilla, a three-time former World Boxing Assn. flyweight
champion, died at home in Caracas, Venezuela, Friday night of
complications from asthma, his doctor, Luiz Miguel Gomez, said.
Bonilla, who was 34, won the title in 1996 by defeating Saen Sor
Ploenchit. He defended his title twice before losing to Hugo Soto in
1998.</TE>

<TE>   Georgia Ridder, a renowned horse breeder who won the 1996
Breeders' Cup Classic with Alphabet Soup, died Friday night of
natural causes at her home in Pasadena. Ridder, called "the first

87.</TE>

cover, yet it ultimately only delayed the inevitable.</LD>
<LD>   The end game here was neither a major revelation nor a clarion
call, but another hard dose of reality. And, inevitably, all of those
desperately waiting for a contender to step up to golf's tee box may
need to consider a 12-step program.</LD>
<LD>   For while a bawdy hey-youse Long Island gallery threw its
considerable vocal support to a birthday-boy underdog from San Diego,
Phil Mickelson, it was the front-runner raised up the coast in
Cypress who continued his assault on his sport and the history books.</LD>
<TE>   Tiger Woods not only won the 102nd U.S. Open on Sunday, he won it
almost wire-to-wire and raindrop-to-raindrop, under cloudy skies and
clear. He shared or held the lead outright on the last 67 holes.</TE>
<TE>   He led the tournament from Thursday afternoon to the end of "60
Minutes." He shot two-over-par 72 on the final day and ended on a
bogey downer, but the bottom line is all Woods has ever counted.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' four-round total of 277 left him at three under overall and
provided him a three-shot victory over Mickelson, who shot par 70 on
Sunday and finished even at 280. Jeff Maggert finished five shots
back at 282, and Sergio Garcia ended up fourth at 283.</TE>
<TE>   In earning his eighth major professional victory, Woods has now
moved past Harry Vardon, Bobby Jones, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead and
Arnold Palmer into a fifth-place tie with Tom Watson on the all-time
list.</TE>
<TE>   Only Jack Nicklaus (18), Walter Hagen (11), Ben Hogan (nine) and
Gary Player (nine) have won more major titles than Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "As a kid, you just dream of winning one," Woods said. "It's so
hard to describe how good it feels to win a major championship,
because it takes so much out of you."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what it takes out of everyone else?</TE>
<TE>   Is he already the best ever?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Woods said. "I'm only 26, it's not like my career
is over."</TE>
<TE>   Is he the best ever?</TE>
<TE>   "That's not really a conversation I want to be a part of,"
Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Is he the best ever?</TE>
<TE>   "You know, it's safe to say that he's the greatest player his age
that's ever been," Maggert said. "I don't think you can compare it to
Nicklaus or Hogan. He's got 20 years ahead of him. There's just no
telling what he can accomplish over the next 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   Is he the best ever?</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you one thing," Garcia said. "It doesn't get much better
than this. He's just unbelievable, and he's just able to do whatever
it takes.... But he's still human. And he showed it. He showed it
today and I had my chance, and I didn't take it."</TE>
<TE>   Woods has now won seven of the last 11 majors played and is
halfway toward winning golf's Grand Slam, with the British Open and
PGA Championship upcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Woods already has won all four majors in succession, the so-called
"Tiger Slam," but has not won all four majors in the same calendar
year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly doable, because I've done it before," Woods said.
"To win all four in a calendar year I think it would just be
different."</TE>
<TE>   Woods also became the first player to win the Masters and U.S.
Open in the same year since Jack Nicklaus in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   On a course that had been called penal and brutal, and a lot of
things worse than that, Woods was the only player on Bethpage Black
to finish under par.</TE>
<TE>   He did not hold off Dick Dumwitty for the title either.</TE>
<TE>   Woods held off his two most formidable challengers, Garcia and
Mickelson, and pretty much held them off the way Lennox Lewis held
off Mike Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Was there ever a doubt?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, sure, the way there's doubt the sun might not rise.</TE>
<TE>   Woods opened final-round play with a four-shot lead and proceeded
to bogey the first two holes to allow both Garcia and Mickelson to
pull to within two shots, with plenty of pasture left to play, yet
neither man could jam a club face into this cracked window of
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it would be a day he would be catchable," Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia thought he saw a crack after Woods dropped two shots on the
first two holes.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he's a little nervous," Garcia said. "He felt the
pressure too."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Garcia and Mickelson who cracked.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson mustered another run on the back nine, closing to within
two shots after he birdied the par-five 13th hole, but Woods took the
shot back when he birdied the 13th while Mickelson made par on No.
14.</TE>
<TE>   Woods basically sealed the tournament on the 15th when he made par
on the difficult par four while Mickelson was making bogey on No. 16.</TE>
<TE>   That exchange extended Woods' lead to four shots with three to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia fancied himself a threat to Woods after he gave Tiger a run
at the 1999 PGA Championship, yet it hasn't exactly played out to
script.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia started play Sunday one under par and four shots back of
the leader but ended with a not-so-beautiful fade at four-over 74.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, who turned 32 Sunday and was a story everyone appeared
ready to embrace, showed flashes of brilliance but appears doomed to
his fate as the boyish, multimillionaire, jet-plane flying also-ran.</TE>
<TE>   He ran his streak to 0 for 40 in major championships, and walked
away again feeling as if it was OK and the way it's always going to
be.</TE>
<TE>   "This was certainly not a disappointing day today," Mickelson
said. "It was one of the most exciting days that I've ever had in the
game of golf."</TE>
<TE>   The day started with a buzz and the keen sense this might be the
day someone--anyone--might be able to catch Woods on the final day of
a major tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery sang "Happy Birthday" to Mickelson as he approached
the tee box at No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's your day," one burly man burped. "Let's go Tiger hunting,"
offered another.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson drilled his tee shot and made birdie on the par-four
first hole to go one under for the tournament and accepted a couple
of Fathers' Day gifts when Woods bogeyed the first two holes.</TE>
<TE>   Before you could say Eldrick, Woods' lead had been trimmed to two
shots over Garcia and Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   There also was an interesting dynamic between Garcia and Woods,
paired in the last group and flanked down the fairways by their
respective girlfriends, tennis star Martina Hingis and Swedish bikini
model Elin Nordegren.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia suggested Friday afternoon's rain-drenched play would have
been suspended had Woods been on the course. He also said Woods was a
lucky golfer.</TE>
<TE>   Both men downplayed tension between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia even tried to play peacemaker, offering Woods his scoring
pencil at the first tee box. Once play began, though, Woods did not
make eye contact with Garcia after the Spaniard wondered if he was in
Woods' putting line on the green.</TE>
<TE>   At least Garcia was trying.</TE>
<TE>   After Woods' second shot on the par-five fourth hole launched a
huge divot into a sand trap, Garcia bounded into the bunker,
retrieved the sod and tossed it to Woods' caddie, Steve Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever works, right?</TE>
<TE>   "Being four shots behind, you usually don't win against a guy like
him," Garcia said. "But I'm proud of myself. I think I did well. I
couldn't try any harder. Maybe I tried too hard."</TE>

<LD>There was a bench-clearing chat between the Angels and Dodgers. No
punches were thrown. No jerseys were grabbed, not really, not in
anger. Only for show.</LD>
<LD>   There was some shouting, and Angel Manager Mike Scioscia somehow
managed to get thrown out.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess [the umpires] were tired of hearing my voice," Scioscia
said.</LD>
<TE>   So you couldn't call this a brawl.</TE>
<TE>   And you can't call what the Dodgers and Angels have a rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Not if you listen to the participants.</TE>
<TE>   It's not like the Dodgers and Giants, says Dodger Manager Jim
Tracy. With that matchup, there's the history; there's playing in the
same division; there are imagined slights, insults, devastating
losses and hatred simmering over generations.</TE>
<TE>   It's not like the Yankees and Mets, interleague neighbors, same as
the Dodgers and Angels--except that the New York teams have met in a
World Series and all the games between the teams happen in New York
so they are, of course, the most important games ever.</TE>
<TE>   Could there have been more made out of nothing than the whole
"should he or shouldn't he" thing between Shawn Estes and Roger
Clemens? And then Estes doesn't hit Clemens, he hits Clemens, with a
home run instead of a beanball.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cook, Angel relief pitcher, actually hit Shawn Green,
suddenly the Dodgers' hottest batter, smack in the middle of the back
with a baseball. In this three-game weekend series between the
Interstate-5 non-rivals, Green hit four home runs and a couple of
doubles.</TE>
<TE>   So when Green came to bat in the bottom of the seventh Sunday,
having already hit two doubles, Cook was just taking the mound,
having replaced Al Levine, who had given up what turned out to be a
game-winning, run-scoring single to Mark Grudzielanek in the Dodgers'
come-from-behind 5-4 victory.</TE>
<TE>   And Cook's one and only pitch hit Green in the back. As Green
jogged to first base, he turned to Cook and yelled "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   And Cook walked toward Green. Only to tell him, Cook said, that he
didn't mean to hit Green. But this is baseball, and baseball is all
about "unwritten rules," which dictate that if the pitcher walks off
the mound, he is making a threat.</TE>
<TE>   So Green started walking toward Cook. And everyone wearing a
baseball uniform started running onto the field. From the dugouts and
bullpens, blue and red, all meeting in the middle to ... stand
around.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these teams is a game out of first place in its division.
The Dodgers trail the defending World Series champion Arizona
Diamondbacks. The Angels are behind the Seattle Mariners, a team that
won 116 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   "What good is throwing a punch and sitting in the clubhouse
watching a game on TV," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad nobody on either team was dumb enough to throw a punch."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees and Mets, they would have thrown punches. That's what
East Coast rivals do. Dumb or not.</TE>
<TE>   West Coast rivals simply sputter some bad words under their
breaths, then shuffle off the field. Some players on each team were
actually giggling as they walked back to their dugouts.</TE>
<TE>   Green said that he really didn't think Cook meant to throw at him.
"In retrospect, it probably wasn't on purpose," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Cook, the father of triplets who seems too nice a man to be
aiming at batters on Father's Day: "I didn't mean to hit him, and
that's all I'll say."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers won two of three in the first part of the six-game
Freeway Series. There were 52,183 at Dodger Stadium Sunday and
156,070 for the series, the most the Dodgers have drawn for a
three-game home series since April 2000, for the first three home
games of the year. But this is no rivalry, right?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rivalry of sorts," Tracy said. "The teams are so close to
one another, and the fans get involved."</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the last three years, benches have been cleared during
the game. But it's no rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "In the obvious geographic sense, it's a rivalry," Scioscia said.
"But real rivalries are built on tradition. Angels-Dodgers will never
be in the same league as Dodgers-Giants."</TE>
<TE>   Real rivalries are also built on closeness, on the sounds of one
team's fans ragging on the other teams' fans, on two neighboring
teams playing each other when the games really matter.</TE>
<TE>   These games over the weekend really mattered. The next three, at
Edison Field June 28-30, also will matter a lot. Both the Dodgers and
Angels seem unwilling to back away from chasing division titles. Both
have unbendable wills; steady, sturdy, talented managers;
overpowering closers (Eric Gagne, Troy Percival); unassuming stars
(Green, Eric Karros, Paul Lo Duca, Darin Erstad, Garret Anderson,
Troy Glaus); some power deficits and a little weakness in middle
relief. Both are chasing powerhouse teams.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals, then? Yes?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   Green grew up in Orange County but never wanted to play for the
Angels. He wanted to play for the Dodgers. He points out that it is
probably necessary to despise a real rival.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the Giants or even Arizona," Green said. "At the end of the
year, I'll be pulling for both teams, Dodgers and Angels, to make the
playoffs. So I think this is always going to be a rivalry only by
proximity."</TE>
<TE>   But over the last nine games--six last year, three so far this
year--five have been decided by one run, one by two. They have been,
Tracy said, "well-played, hard-fought, just what baseball fans want
between their rivals."</TE>
<TE>   Aha! Caught ya, Jim.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals. Really.</TE>

<HD>Surprise From Senegal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Unknowns in this World Cup no more, the cagey Lions of Senegal,
thanks to a sudden-death goal by Henri Camara against Sweden on
Sunday at Oita, Japan, now have something to put on their calling
cards.</LD>
<LD>   Senegal, World Cup quarterfinalist.</LD>
<LD>   Senegal, the first African team since Cameroon in 1990 to qualify
for the final eight in a World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   Senegal, a 2-1 second-round winner over Sweden and never a loser
in a World Cup match ...</TE>
<TE>   That last item comes with a disclaimer: Senegal is 2-0-2 all-time
in World Cup games, because until three weeks ago, Senegal had never
played a World Cup game.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions are making history in a hurry. Having beaten 1998
champion France in their debut, they have now enabled Africa to beat
South America to the 2002 quarterfinals. That's a statistic worth
mulling: Africa has a team in the final eight and South America has
only one team left in the tournament--Brazil, which plays Belgium in
a second-round match Monday in Kobe, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup rookies aren't supposed to knock off defending
champions, they aren't supposed to beat veteran teams such as Sweden
in the second round, and they most certainly aren't supposed to score
the golden goal in their first World Cup overtime appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing the birth of a great team," Senegal Coach Bruno
Metsu said after watching his squad advance on the first
sudden-death--or golden--goal of the tournament, Camara's
104th-minute strike past Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy to have beaten this strong Sweden team. Sweden
had gone 16 matches without a loss. Senegal is happy to have beaten
Sweden in the 17th match."</TE>
<TE>   Senegal had to rally to do so. Sweden's Henrik Larsson scored his
third goal of the tournament, a header, in the 11th minute. With
their experienced defense ready to clamp down on a Senegal team
depleted by the suspensions of midfielders Salif Diao and Khalilou
Fadiga, Sweden seemed poised to turn that goal into a trip to the
final eight.</TE>
<TE>   But Senegal's speed and attacking style kept the pressure on the
Swedish defense until Camara, in the 37th minute, turned a small
crack into a 1-1 tie. Chesting down a pass, Camara dribbled through
three defenders before beating Hedman on a low attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden spent the rest of the game squandering chances--and was
unlucky not to win in overtime, when Anders Svensson's shot banged
the post minutes before Camara's second and game-ending goal.
Crushed, the Swedes reacted to the heartbreaking defeat like, well,
Swedes.</TE>
<TE>   "It must be so happy for them," midfielder Pontus Farnerud said of
Senegal. "But not for us, of course."</TE>
<TE>   Added Larsson: "This is a marvelous tournament. Although I'm not
happy, I am grateful to the Japanese supporters. Sayonara!"</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, Senegal advances to a quarterfinal match against
the winner of the Japan-Turkey second-round game. Cameroon in 1990
was the first African nation to play in a World Cup quarterfinal,
losing to England. Senegal is the second--and it can become the first
to reach the semifinals with one more victory.</TE>

<HD>Fledgling Tennis Channel Gains Momentum</HD>
<DH>Television: Though no launch date has been set, a 15-year
affiliation deal with Time Warner Cable should speed up reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tennis Channel was only an idea 2 1/2 years ago, and some thought
it was a harebrained one.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Golf Channel has enjoyed moderate success since its
inception nearly eight years ago. But a tennis channel?</LD>
<LD>   Today, a week before the start of Wimbledon, the Tennis Channel
takes a big step toward becoming a reality before the end of the
year.</LD>
<TE>   Although no launch date has been set, the Tennis Channel and Time
Warner Cable are announcing that they have entered into an
unprecedented 15-year affiliation agreement. No financial aspects of
the deal were announced.</TE>
<TE>   David Meister, chairman and CEO of the Tennis Channel, said the
agreement is important because he now expects other major cable
operators to follow suit and soon be jumping on board.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV is also a possibility, but probably further down the road
because it is in the midst of a proposed merger with EchoStar.</TE>
<TE>   "But the most important aspect of our agreement with Time Warner
Cable is that it gives us credibility with potential sponsors,"
Meister said.</TE>
<TE>   Time Warner Cable, the country's second-largest multiple-system
operator, reaches 12.8 million homes.</TE>
<TE>   Meister said the cable company plans to put the Tennis Channel on
a special digital "sports tier," which would include other sports
channels such as the Golf Channel and the Speed Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Other channel owners, such as Fox, have resisted such an
arrangement, believing a pay sports tier would lessen the number of
viewers, thus adversely affecting ad rates.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the people who are going to be watching the Tennis
Channel will spend the couple of bucks a month it will cost for a
sports tier," Meister said. "So we don't believe that will hurt our
viewing audience."</TE>
<TE>   Meister said the length of the contract evolved during
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "It just kept getting longer and longer," he said. "I think what
Time Warner's concern was that we wouldn't be coming back to them
after three years, or five years, and say we need more money. Then
they would have to pass that cost on to their customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The length of the contract guarantees them that we will show
financial responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   The Tennis Channel, which is headquartered in Santa Monica,
provides Time Warner Cable with a vehicle for getting more of its
customers to switch to digital cable.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tennis Channel is just the type of network we're looking for
as we expand our consumer offering," said Fred Dressler, Time Warner
Cable executive vice president. "It's a compelling concept, based on
the proven appeal of tennis."</TE>
<TE>   The Tennis Channel is the brainchild of Meister and Steve Bellamy,
an energetic tennis teacher and entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy, the Tennis Channel president, is best known for
renovating the Palisades Tennis Center, where his pupils have
included actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Goldie Hawn, Hilary Swank and
Sally Field.</TE>
<TE>   Meister is an experienced television executive, having been a top
executive at HBO Sports in its infancy and having launched Cinemax.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy and Meister met at a holiday gathering in 1999, and not
long afterward began working nonstop on getting the Tennis Channel up
and running.</TE>
<TE>   The lead investor is Frank Biondi, former head of Viacom. A number
of other former Viacom executives also have put up money, and so has
Pete Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   It generally costs about $100 million to launch a channel, but the
Tennis Channel has found ways to cut costs. It made an arrangement
for Comedy Central to line up affiliates and made another arrangement
with Sports Marketing Partners to handle ad sales and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   These deals, industry sources say, will save the Tennis Channel
millions of dollars that it would have cost to hire full-time people.</TE>
<TE>   The channel will devote 40% of its content to live, early-round
tournament play, 40% to instruction, resorts and equipment, and 20%
to tennis news and player profiles.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main goal is to serve this country's 70 million tennis
enthusiasts," Bellamy said. "Tennis is the most underserved sport on
television--by far. And when it's on, you never know where to look.
Tennis is on 14 different channels right now.</TE>
<TE>   "Tennis is a great sport. It just hasn't been presented well by
television."</TE>
<TE>   One exception is Wimbledon. This year, in addition to 37 1/2 hours
of coverage on NBC, TNT will offer 86 1/2 hours, with another 28 on
CNN-FN.</TE>
<TE>   The Tennis Channel has been well-endorsed by the tennis world. Its
18-member advisory board is made up of some of the biggest names in
the sport, including Billie Jean King, Brad Gilbert and ATP board
member Charlie Pasarell.</TE>
<TE>   "Tennis fans are the most passionate in the world and will be
ravenous to get this network," King said. "It is something I am
passionate about and something that is long overdue."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pasarell: "I will do anything to support these guys. I have
known Frank Biondi for years and understand that he does not fail at
anything. Combined with Steve Bellamy's love for tennis and the
management team they have, the Tennis Channel is sure to be a
reality."</TE>

<HD>City Delays Threaten Proposed Car Prep Plant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposed $25-million car processing plant near Port Hueneme that
could bring 250 new jobs to Oxnard may be scrapped because of city
delays to approve the project, company officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Vehicle Processors wants to convert 38 acres south of
Hueneme Road into a plant for preparing imported vehicles before they
are shipped to dealerships. The facility would allow PVP to
accommodate a new contract with Volkswagen and its Audi luxury
division to handle 100,000 vehicles annually beginning in November,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The company would wash, repair and accessorize imported cars from
Mexico and Germany before they are loaded on trucks destined for U.S.
showrooms.</LD>
<TE>   PVP has been seeking city review of its plans since January, and
the delay by city officials may cause it to lose its contract with
Volkswagen, said James Kilpatrick, vice president of marketing. After
another Planning Commission postponement last week, the company's
project is slated for commission review July 18 and a City Council
hearing the following month.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners have expressed interest in the project, but say more
time is needed for a complete environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   As it now stands, PVP wouldn't be able to get its processing
center operational until early next year. Further delays could prompt
the carmaker to drop its plans to relocate its processing operations
to Oxnard, according to Volkswagen.</TE>
<TE>   "We liked the reception from local politicians and civic groups
... at least until we ran into these difficulties," said Chuck Domke,
an official with Michigan-based Volkswagen of America. "We're at the
point now where we have to consider contingency plans. We still need
to distribute our company's cars, and if we can't do it in Oxnard,
we'll have to do it somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard planning commissioners say they are anxious to review the
project and pass it along to the City Council. But Planning
Department staff members say they need more time to consider the
environmental effect of a new processing plant and deal with
community concerns about more trucks traveling through Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders and port officials said losing the plant would be
economically devastating.</TE>
<TE>   PVP, which already employs about 250 people to process Jaguars,
Land Rovers, Mitsubishis, Suzukis and Volvos, would double its work
force to accommodate the Volkswagen contract.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, could generate about 500 additional jobs at the
Port of Hueneme in order to support activities at the plant, and more
than $13 million in new wages during the plant's first year in
operation, according to port consultants.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone favors the new plant. Environmental activists and
community leaders are concerned the facility would endanger nearby
wetlands at Ormond Beach. Some also fear the added traffic from car
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The Saviers Road Design Team, a group of local activists, would
rather see the 38-acre tract converted into a park with public access
to the wetlands, said member Shirley Godwin. Their plan calls for
extending Saviers Road into the park area and building bridges and
raised walkways for bird-watching.</TE>
<TE>   PVP has offered to incorporate a public viewing area of the
wetlands into its proposal. The tract in question is not part of the
wetlands, but directly north of them.</TE>
<TE>   The local environmentalists said building the processing facility
essentially takes the land away from the community, and have not been
charmed by PVP's offer to provide a smaller viewing area. With so few
wetlands left, each available acre should be preserved, Godwin said,
including land that can be used to reach them.</TE>
<TE>   Jess Herrera, an Oxnard Harbor commissioner, stressed that the new
plant is vital for the harbor and the region's economic future.</TE>
<TE>   "This port has been designated as an economic resource by the
state. We bring construction, jobs, property taxes, sales taxes,
livable wages," Herrera said. "As long as we keep doing it right, the
community should be behind us."</TE>

<HD>Taking Aim at Sharpshooter</HD>
<DH>Infestation: A Santa Paula company breeds the insect, which
is ravaging state vineyards, for use in a program intended to
eradicate it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is considered a scourge of California agriculture, Public Enemy
No. 1 for grape growers.</LD>
<LD>   So it might seem odd that Jake Blehm spends his days hunting the
glassy-winged sharpshooter, not to kill the voracious insect but to
make it produce as many as 10,000 offspring a week.</LD>
<LD>   Blehm owns Buena Biosystems in Santa Paula, the only company in
California contracted to collect sharpshooter eggs as part of a
statewide project to control the spread of a pest that has wreaked
havoc on the state's wine industry and threatens other crops.</LD>
<TE>   Every other week, Blehm loads plants peppered with the eggs into
the bed of his Ford pickup and delivers them to a research station in
Riverside. There, they are inserted into cages swarming with
dive-bombing wasps no bigger than grains of rice but which are
natural enemies of the needle-nosed insect.</TE>
<TE>   The wasps sting the eggs and lay eggs of their own inside,
producing offspring that feed on the evolving sharpshooter and emerge
about two weeks later with a singular appetite for their yellow-eyed
adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "That becomes their sole purpose in life," said Blehm, one of a
handful of bug breeders in Ventura County, long considered an area
that helped pioneer the use of biological controls.</TE>
<TE>   "People have referred to us as Typhoid Mary, because we are
producing this insect that nobody wants, except for researchers,"
Blehm said. "But it is gratifying to be part of a project that is
contributing to keeping California agriculture viable."</TE>
<TE>   The effort is one of more than 60 research projects underway
across California to battle the half-inch sharpshooter, an exotic
pest discovered in the state in the late 1980s after being
accidentally brought in from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other pests that feed on fruit, the sharpshooter does its
damage by delivering a bacterium that causes Pierce's disease, which
clogs water-carrying vessels in plants and starves them of nutrients
until they wither and die. Vineyards are particularly susceptible,
although the disease also strikes almond trees, oleanders and other
plants.</TE>
<TE>   Though the disease has plagued agricultural areas for more than a
century, the arrival of the aggressive, fast-moving sharpshooter has
supercharged its spread.</TE>
<TE>   The worst damage has occurred in Temecula, where 1,000 acres of
wine grapes have been destroyed in recent years, costing growers $40
million. Smaller infestations have also been reported from San Diego
to San Bernardino and throughout the San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials are devoting $20 million a year to
keeping the sharpshooter from moving into high-priced winemaking
regions such as Napa and Sonoma. Just last week, ballots were mailed
to Napa County grape growers asking if they would tax themselves
$4.51 an acre to support the struggle against the vine-killing
insect.</TE>
<TE>   Deployment of biological controls, such as the tiny wasps being
bred in Riverside, is key to the long-term sharpshooter battle, said
Jay Van Rein, spokesman for the California Department of Food and
Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting plenty of evidence from our surveys that we are
having quite a bit of success so far," Van Rein said. "These wasps
have got a very finely tuned appetite. They won't go after much else
other than sharpshooter eggs."</TE>
<TE>   About $2 million has been devoted so far to this micro-war.</TE>
<TE>   The wasps, which pose no dangers to humans because their stingers
are so small they can't penetrate skin, started being released last
year and are now buzzing infested areas throughout Southern
California and as far north as Santa Clara County.</TE>
<TE>   Because the sharpshooter was accidentally introduced to
California, it had no natural enemies in the state. So researchers
imported the wasps from Mexico, producing 134,000 of the winged
insects last year and the same amount so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   A chief goal of the program is to establish colonies of the wasps
in the wild and create a self-perpetuating line of defense against
the sharpshooter.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a quick fix, especially against a pest that moves
rapidly and in many areas now appears in significant numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Biological control never has been and never will be a radical
response," said David Morgan, a state research scientist helping
oversee the part of the project based at UC Riverside. "But we have
to pursue every possible angle for controlling this pest, and we see
it as an integral part of an overall control strategy.''</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside facility and one in Bakersfield are producing three
species of wasps, all of which have had success controlling
sharpshooter populations. Researchers also produce sharpshooter eggs,
but have had trouble keeping pace with demand.</TE>
<TE>   That is why they turned to Buena Biosystems, one of the nation's
largest producers of beneficial insects, with about $1 million in
annual sales and 500 customers on four continents.</TE>
<TE>   Last December, the insectary won a yearlong contract to produce
10,000 sharpshooter eggs a week. The company started delivering eggs
to the research facilities in March. Blehm estimates he has supplied
about 100,000 eggs to date, using a rudimentary system of collecting
pregnant sharpshooters from local orchards and putting them in
plastic-enclosed chambers, where they deposit their eggs on
garden-variety plants.</TE>
<TE>   Blehm said he hopes his involvement at this stage will put his
company in position to take part in future sharpshooter projects,
including any move state researchers make to contract with private
companies for wasp production.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is also eager to explore using some of his other bugs
in the sharpshooter battle--including the green lacewing, which
liquefies its enemies before eating them from the inside out. A
lacewing field trial is pending.</TE>

<HD>Targeting a Sharpshooter</HD>
<DH>Infestation: Santa Paula firm breeds the vineyard-ravaging
insect for use in a program aimed at eradicating it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is considered a scourge of California agriculture, Public Enemy
No. 1 for grape growers.</LD>
<LD>   So it might seem odd that Jake Blehm spends his days hunting the
glassy-winged sharpshooter, not to kill the voracious insect but to
make it produce as many as 10,000 offspring a week.</LD>
<LD>   Blehm owns Buena Biosystems in Santa Paula, the only company in
California contracted to collect sharpshooter eggs as part of a
statewide project to control the spread of a pest that has wreaked
havoc on the state's wine industry and threatens other crops.</LD>
<TE>   Every other week, Blehm loads plants peppered with the eggs into
the bed of his Ford pickup and delivers them to a research station in
Riverside. There, they are inserted into cages swarming with
dive-bombing wasps no bigger than grains of rice but which are
natural enemies of the needle-nosed insect.</TE>
<TE>   The wasps sting the eggs and lay eggs of their own inside,
producing offspring that feed on the evolving sharpshooter and emerge
about two weeks later with a singular appetite for their yellow-eyed
adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "That becomes their sole purpose in life," said Blehm, one of a
handful of bug breeders in Ventura County, long considered an area
that helped pioneer the use of biological controls.</TE>
<TE>   "People have referred to us as Typhoid Mary, because we are
producing this insect that nobody wants, except for researchers,"
Blehm said. "But it is gratifying to be part of a project that is
contributing to keeping California agriculture viable."</TE>
<TE>   The effort is one of more than 60 research projects underway
across California to battle the half-inch sharpshooter, an exotic
pest discovered in the state in the late 1980s after being
accidentally brought in from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other pests that feed on fruit, the sharpshooter does its
damage by delivering a bacterium that causes Pierce's disease, which
clogs water-carrying vessels in plants and starves them of nutrients
until they wither and die. Vineyards are particularly susceptible,
although the disease also strikes almond trees, oleanders and other
plants.</TE>
<TE>   Though the disease has plagued agricultural areas for more than a
century, the arrival of the aggressive, fast-moving sharpshooter has
supercharged its spread.</TE>
<TE>   The worst damage has occurred in Temecula, where 1,000 acres of

<HD>Man, 27, Critically Burned at Barbecue</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Authorities say the injuries occurred to about 80%

spraying alcohol on the coals.</DH>

<LD>A man apparently barbecuing at a Father's Day celebration was in
critical condition Sunday after he squirted alcohol on the grill,
which exploded into a fireball, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 27-year-old Lake Forest man, whose name was not released,
suffered second- and third-degree burns to about 80% of his body.</LD>
<LD>   Capt. Stephen Miller of the Orange County Fire Authority said the
man was barbecuing on a small patio outside his ground-floor
apartment, with small children and the man's wife present.</LD>
<TE>   He became impatient that the coals were not heating up quickly
enough, so he used the alcohol to help it along.</TE>
<TE>   Miller surmised that as the man squirted the alcohol on the fire,
the flame traveled up the stream into the container, and blew up.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Authority received the call at 2:54 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The man was flown by helicopter ambulance to the burn unit at the
UCI Medical Center in Orange, arriving about 3:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   No one else was hurt, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The building suffered about $100 worth of damage.</TE>
<TE>   The fire captain said it is not uncommon for people to pour a
flammable liquid, such as lighter fluid or gasoline, on a barbecue to
get the fire going.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, this is what results," Miller said.</TE>

<HD>For 14 Years, Inmates Have Been Fed for $2.45 a Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>One in an occasional series.</SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The problems besetting California's massive prison system are many
and grave: gang violence, overcrowding and rising health-care costs,
to name a few. In recent weeks, however, lawmakers have been gnawing
on a somewhat lighter topic:</LD>
<LD>   What inmates eat.</LD>
<LD>   It all started last month at a hearing to confirm Edward S.
Alameida as director of the state Department of Corrections.</LD>
<TE>   State Sen. John Burton, the San Francisco Democrat in charge of
the hearing, asked Alameida a series of meaty questions--about prison
dental care, drug abuse counseling and programs to prepare inmates
for parole.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the humdinger.</TE>
<TE>   How, Burton wanted to know, can California feed its convicts on
$2.30 a day?</TE>
<TE>   Now, Alameida is a savvy corrections veteran, and he was well
prepared to hold forth on a range of subjects. But this, it's safe to
say, was as startling as finding a fly in his fettuccini.</TE>
<TE>   Alameida began by telling Burton that the food budget is actually
a bit more generous-- $2.45 a day. The senator was unimpressed.</TE>
<TE>   "What the [heck] can you get for that?" Burton barked. "You could
probably do Special K and milk three meals a day .... "</TE>
<TE>   As the audience stifled giggles, Alameida regrouped, noting that
when he was warden at the state prison in Tracy, he ate frequently in
the inmate dining hall. His duties, he explained, included ensuring
that meals were edible.</TE>
<TE>   "And I can say, Senator, we do quite a bit with $2.45 a day," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Burton looked unconvinced, but Alameida was confirmed on a
unanimous vote that afternoon. The investigation into prison chow,
however, had only just begun.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter Two unfolded the following week, when three wardens
traveled to Sacramento for their confirmation hearings. First up was
Diana Butler from Folsom State Prison, an old, granite fortress about
30 miles east of the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   This time, it was state Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) on the
warpath, calling previous testimony about prison food "very
disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   "This $2.45 a day, that bothers me," she said. "I don't know how I
could eat one meal for that, unless it was real skimpy."</TE>
<TE>   Butler had clearly been briefed. She launched into a lively
dissertation on prison nutrition, describing the state's goal of
providing inmates with 2,500 daily calories and a new "heart-healthy"
diet that cuts fat.</TE>
<TE>   "Every meal is balanced," she said. There is even an inmate food
committee that rates the quality of the fare.</TE>
<TE>   Butler also used a prop to make her case that the cons are amply
nourished--sample menus she passed out to the legislators. That
roused Sen. William "Pete" Knight (R-Palmdale), heretofore silent on
the matter. Spotting the Sunday night cheeseburger meal, he asked:
"What's this 'secret sauce?' "</TE>
<TE>   Butler had a humorous, if unenlightening, reply: "It must be an
old family recipe, sir."</TE>
<TE>   Burton pronounced himself impressed with the menu, although he
noted that "there's a lot of turkey--sliced turkey, turkey bologna,
smoked turkey, turkey pastrami, turkey ham...."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, Butler explained, is low in fat and also acceptable to
inmates whose religions forbid other meats.</TE>
<TE>   Another menu item--"hot cornmeal mush"--prompted Burton to take a
little jog down memory lane: "My mom used to serve that to me when I
was a kid," the senator mused, drawing chuckles from his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Joking aside, feeding 158,000 felons three times a day is a big,
cumbersome business. It works out to almost half a million meals a
day, or 172 million meals a year. The Department of Corrections'
annual food budget is $145 million.</TE>
<TE>   With that kind of buying power, the state can get some pretty good
deals on the food market.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Summerset, who oversees food supplied to the state's 33
prisons, said there has been no increase in the $2.45 daily meal rate
for 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of inmates say the state simply buys low-quality
products and skimps on fresh fruit and other more costly items.</TE>
<TE>   Summerset acknowledged that some fruits are banned because they
can be distilled into "pruno," a crude form of alcohol. But she
denied that prison officials sacrifice quality to save money.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ayers, a lieutenant at Folsom, added that today's prison
vittles look positively gourmet compared to what state lock-ups used
to serve.</TE>
<TE>   A menu from June 1925, on display in the Folsom prison museum,
features beans twice a day, five days a week-- occasionally
accompanied by a hunk of brown bread.</TE>
<TE>   Why the legislative preoccupation with prison rations? Perhaps
it's spring fever, or frustration with the inevitable partisan
squabbling over the state budget. Perhaps it's merely an extension of
the Capitol's love affair with food--from fund-raising suppers to
charity breakfasts to "let's do" lunches.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps the adequacy of convict cuisine just seems like a
problem that is easily digestible, unlike so many other complex,
heartburn-inducing dilemmas facing California's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, a Sacramento veteran, says that for him, it's a case of
this "inconceivable" notion that "they can really feed these guys on
$2.45 a day."</TE>
<TE>   "This menu doesn't look bad--kinda like the Army," he said. "But
unless the portions are minuscule, like a half a cup of cornmeal
mush, I don't think they can really do it."</TE>
<TE>   And so, the senator said, he may just take Warden Butler up on her
invitation to visit her institution and sit down for a meal with the
cons.</TE>
<TE>   But if he does, Burton said, he will show up unannounced.</TE>

<HD>Farmers Oppose Call to Idle Land</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Tempers flare in Imperial Valley as a U.S.
deadline nears to cut use of Colorado River water. 'Fallowing is a
four-letter word,' a grower says.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WESTMORLAND, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) lectured the farmers of
the Imperial Valley that they should let some of their fields go dry
so their water can be sold to arid San Diego County, it was bound to
be a controversial notion.</LD>
<LD>   But when she warned bluntly that the federal government might just
take their water without paying if farmers refuse to fallow, Imperial
Irrigation District board member Bruce Kuhn could not restrain
himself.</LD>
<LD>   "I would expect nothing less from Feinstein, being the
bureaucratic gasbag, pig-eyed sack of crap that she is," Kuhn was
quoted as saying last month in a front-page story in the Imperial
Valley Press. "They will not take the water without a long,
protracted legal battle. She has got her head stuck in the sand."</LD>
<TE>   In the days that followed his outburst, Kuhn was rebuked by
farmers and other board members of the Imperial Irrigation District.
He and the board apologized to Feinstein. But the sentiments that
charged Kuhn have not gone away.</TE>
<TE>   In this forbidding desert, where pioneers a century ago laid claim
to Colorado River water that has created a billion-dollar-a-year
agricultural empire, there is no deeper fear than that politically
powerful outsiders will someday take away that water and order the
farmers to let their fields wither and die.</TE>
<TE>   And now Feinstein and others say that is exactly what Imperial
Valley farmers must do, on a limited scale, to rescue urban and
suburban Southern California from a crippling reduction in their
allocation from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the Imperial Valley farmers fallow a portion of their land
so that their water can be used elsewhere, those officials say, the
state faces a mandatory cutback from the Colorado River that could
devastate the entire state's lifestyle and economy.</TE>
<TE>   Water officials in San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento insist
that a plan can take some fields out of cultivation without damaging
the agricultural economy of the Imperial Valley. The farmers, whose
livelihoods and heritage are at risk, are dubious.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement with six other states and the federal
government, California has until the end of the year to find a
strategy to use less water from the Colorado River. That would keep
Arizona, Nevada and other Western states from pressuring the federal
government to make good on its oft-repeated threat to cut
California's allocation if it cannot find a way to curb its voracious
thirst for water.</TE>
<TE>   For years, cities in Southern California have been using water
that rightfully belongs to other states, according to federal law.
Now those states, facing rapid population growth, want their water
back. And California is scrambling to reallocate water from farms to
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Kuhn's outburst was fueled by the realization in many farm
communities that their once-vaunted political clout is slipping,
according to a UC Santa Cruz professor who teaches a course on
California's water wars.</TE>
<TE>   "As their political power declines, so does their hold on their
water," said Brent Haddad, associate professor of environmental
studies and author of "Rivers of Gold," a treatise on fallowing and
water sales. "The Imperial Irrigation District was once the most
powerful water district in the country. The pioneer families have
always expected a frontal assault on their water rights. And now it's
here."</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Irrigation District, which provides water and power
for 140,000 residents and 500,000 acres of farmland, is at center
stage in this latest California water fight for one simple reason: It
began drawing water from the Colorado River decades before Los
Angeles and other coastal cities and therefore is entitled to 70% of
the state's share of the river.</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado River is Southern California's largest source of
imported water, providing at least half of the water distributed by
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to 17 million
people in six counties.</TE>
<TE>   When the Clinton administration began pressuring California to
reduce its dependence on the river, the preferred method was for
water-rich but cash-poor agricultural districts to sell water to
thirsty but affluent coastal regions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   River Policy Unchanged</TE>
<TE>   If the Imperial Valley farmers were hoping for a better deal from
the Bush administration, they've been disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado River policy is one of the few environmental areas in
which the new administration has continued the approach of its
predecessor. Soon after Kuhn's diatribe against Feinstein, Bennett W.
Raley, assistant interior secretary for water and science, wrote to
the irrigation district in support of Feinstein's position.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Raley repeated his warning at a hearing in Riverside
County of a congressional subcommittee. He told the water and power
subcommittee of the House Resources Committee that he understands the
Imperial Valley farmers' hard-set feelings about fallowing but that
their opposition is not enough to kill the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The fallowing clash has been brewing since 1995, when the San
Diego County Water Authority and the Imperial Irrigation District
began negotiations over what would be the largest farm-to-cities sale
of water in the nation's history. The 75-year plan would transfer
billions of gallons in exchange for billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Valley farmers would be paid to install conservation
devices to allow them to continue cultivating the same number of
acres with less water. From the beginning, the irrigation district
was insistent: No fallowing.</TE>
<TE>   In an agricultural economy, if farmers stop planting crops, the
ripples can be immediate and profound. Myriad businesses that depend
on farming, such as crop dusters, equipment stores and fertilizer
companies, suffer a decline in revenue; land values can plummet; and
farm workers are left jobless.</TE>
<TE>   But devising a way to conserve water on farms--and avoid
fallowing--has proved more difficult than expected. Now the year-end
deadline looms, and the exact thing that the farmers have long feared
is being suggested by Feinstein and others as the only alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan was supposed to be win-win," Kuhn said. "But now it's
turned into they win and the Imperial Valley gets a kick in the ass."</TE>
<TE>   Officials are discussing fallowing 10,000 to 75,000 acres a year.
Although that might seem a small fraction of the county's 500,000
farm acres, Kuhn and others think it would be the beginning of
demands for more water and more fallowing.</TE>
<TE>   Although his comments have been widely criticized as intemperate,
his hell-no-we-won't-fallow stance has made Kuhn a kind of folk hero.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pure Bruce," said Al Kalin, a third-generation Imperial
Valley farmer. "I've been at plenty of meetings where he's said
things just like that. Fallowing is a four-letter word in the
Imperial Valley, and a U.S. senator should have known that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Oppose Tactics</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Kuhn went over the line and made things personal, which you
should never do," said John Pierre Menvielle, also a third-generation
farmer. "He made us all sound like hicks. It's not what he said, it's
how he said it."</TE>
<TE>   Menvielle told a legislative committee in Sacramento not to expect
Imperial Valley farmers to willingly or cheaply part with their
water: "Farmer does not rhyme with stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials such as Adan Ortega, an executive with the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, are confident
that a method can be devised to offset any economic impact because of
limited fallowing. A similar plan is being developed in the Palo
Verde Valley near Blythe.</TE>
<TE>   In Palo Verde, a tentative agreement with the water district calls
for direct payments to farmers and establishment of a
multimillion-dollar fund to aid farm workers and businesses hurt when
crops are not planted.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega notes that Imperial Valley farmers already fallow, although
they refer to it as crop rotation. "They wouldn't be doing anything
they're not already doing, except making money on it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is, of course, a difference between doing something
voluntarily and doing something by government order. Stubbornness and
cynicism about politicians run deep in the Imperial Valley's farm
culture. "I guess it's the whole pioneer instinct," Kalin said. "We
don't like outsiders telling us what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's dictum came in response to a meeting in Washington
with officials from multiple Southern California water districts. In
a letter to Stella Mendoza, board chairwoman of the Imperial
Irrigation District, Feinstein warned:</TE>
<TE>   "If Imperial does not decide to fallow, there is a serious risk
that the Department of Interior ... could be forced to initiate the
proceedings to take the water [the Imperial Irrigation District] had
planned to transfer, and there would not be any compensation .... The
more I have become involved in this issue, the more I've come to
believe that there is no workable alternative other than fallowing."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza was furious, but unlike Kuhn, was careful that her
strongest statements were not quoted in the Imperial Valley Press,
which covers water and the irrigation district as closely as national
newspapers cover the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to bankrupt the Imperial Valley just so the
coast can have our water," Mendoza said. "I will not look someone in
the eye and say, 'Sorry you lost your home and your job, but you have
to realize somebody else needed our water.' "</TE>
<TE>   Imperial Valley officials have objections to the proposed deal
with San Diego County Water Authority other than impacts on the farm
industry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salton Sea Is an Issue</TE>
<TE>   Among their worries is that the cost of mending the sickly Salton
Sea will be shifted by the federal government to the Imperial Valley.
The water sale to San Diego could reduce agricultural runoff to the
landlocked sea, thereby making it saltier and more contaminated. Some
cost estimates of fixing the sea exceed $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "San Diego is offering a fistful of dollars for a truck-full of
liability," said John Hawk, board member of the Imperial Valley
Vegetable Growers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A saying in the Imperial Valley holds that the pioneers guarded
their water rights with shotguns, and now their grandchildren and
great-grandchildren guard them with lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Already there is talk of fighting all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court, if necessary, to prevent any forced fallowing.</TE>
<TE>   Said Imperial Irrigation District board member Andy Horne: "This
is a hill we're prepared to die on."</TE>

<HD>Festival to Celebrate Folk Traditions</HD>
<DH>Calabasas: Event at Soka University will feature tunes and
arts from a dozen cultures. Dulcimer legend Jean Ritchie set to
perform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elaine Weissman prepares for the Summer Solstice Folk Music, Dance &amp;
Storytelling Festival in Calabasas as if she were a general about to
go to war.</LD>
<LD>   This year's festival, running Friday through Sunday, has been in
the works for more than 18 months. Five thousand people are expected
to attend the festival, the largest traditional music and arts fest
on the West Coast, and the logistics are as complicated as a cat's
cradle.</LD>
<LD>   The contract to bring folk legend Jean Ritchie to the event was
inked two years ago, said Weissman, who has organized 19 previous
festivals. More than 100 traditional artists, some world famous, have
been hired to perform and teach.</LD>
<TE>   A 40-foot-by-90-foot wooden dance floor will be built over the
clay tennis courts on the Soka University campus, impervious to the
most leaden-footed clog dancer but easy on the knees. Vendors,
security personnel, an emergency medical team, 18 portable toilets to
augment those already on campus, water jugs--all must be in place
when the first folk enthusiast arrives.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a military operation," said Weissman, 62, executive
director of the California Traditional Music Society, the festival's
sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California isn't the cradle of the traditional arts that
Appalachia is, but Greater Los Angeles has its own folk roots. Woody
Guthrie once strummed his guitar, naked, in Topanga Canyon. Joni
Mitchell sang about life as one of the ladies of Laurel Canyon, and
91-year-old Bess Lomax Hawes, a winner of the National Medal of the
Arts for her advocacy of folk traditions, lives in Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   There are thousands of folk fests in the United States each year,
said Mark Moss, editor of Sing Out, a Bethlehem, Pa.-based folk music
magazine. But the Calabasas festival is unusual, he said, because of
its "allegiance to traditional or rooted music as opposed to
singer/songwriter-type music."</TE>
<TE>   Its organizers say that the festival will feature music and other
arts from a dozen cultures, including Quebecois, Iranian and Romany
(or gypsy). Celtic music will be performed in all its variants,
including Irish, Scottish and Breton.</TE>
<TE>   But audience participation is the heart of the festival, Weissman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors may choose from more than 300 workshops, among them
sessions on how to play Andean panpipes and the Australian aboriginal
horn known as the didgeridoo. They can learn how to do the lively
Italian folk dance called the tarantella and join in daily sessions
of contra dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Sunland's Frank Hoppe, 48, who has coordinated the contra dancing
at past festivals, described it by saying, "Remember the old Virginia
reel when you were in junior high? That's a really primitive form of
contra dance."</TE>
<TE>   "We're keeping these traditions alive by teaching them to another
generation, who's teaching them to yet another generation," Weissman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Dulson, 52, of Long Beach is in charge of instruction on the
mountain dulcimer. He explained how the traditional Appalachian
instrument differs from the hammer dulcimer, which typically rests in
front of the player, who strikes it with small hammers.</TE>
<TE>   "The mountain dulcimer is a fretted instrument like a guitar,"
said Dulson, who plays one in an Irish band called the Tinker's Own.
"It's played on your lap, and it's typically strummed or
finger-picked."</TE>
<TE>   Newly inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame, 80-year-old
Jean Ritchie will sing at the festival and play the mountain dulcimer
she popularized.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's excited about seeing her," said festival director
Tammy Javorsek, 44. "They sense that she's not coming around that
many more times."</TE>
<TE>   Ritchie will also teach a workshop or two, said Dulson, who has
lined up four other teachers as well.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't Ritchie who turned Dulson on to the mountain
dulcimer. "The first time I ever saw one was on 'The Ed Sullivan
Show,' when Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones was playing it on 'Lady
Jane.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ron Brown, 45, of Long Beach will conduct "boot camps" on an Irish
drum called a bodhran. What distinguishes a boot camp from other
beginning instruction, Brown said, is that boot camps are for people
who see the word bodhran and ask, "How do you pronounce that?" The
answer, according to Brown: bow-rawn.</TE>
<TE>   Brown started playing Celtic music 25 years ago. With fellow
enthusiasts, many of whom he met at past festivals, Brown formed the
Celtic Regional Arts Institute of California, or CRAIC. "In Ireland,
craic means a great time, a good time, fun," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Beloff, 46, who lives in the Hollywood Hills, is in charge of
ukulele instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Beloff, who has written more than a dozen books about the ukulele,
said he tumbled for a beautiful little uke 10 years ago at the Rose
Bowl Flea Market.</TE>
<TE>   "Within a week I was so smitten I gave up the guitar, which I had
been playing for 30 years," said Beloff, who once spent an afternoon
jamming with the late George Harrison on their ukuleles.</TE>
<TE>   None of the artists at the festival has ever made outrageous
demands of the kind rock musicians are notorious for, organizers
said. "I don't think there are divas in folk," said festival director
Javorsek.</TE>

<HD>After Face Lift, City Hall Wins New Film Roles</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Popular with Hollywood producers, the renovated
building is back in the limelight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmmakers are again clogging the marble corridors of Los Angeles
City Hall, which was off-limits for three years while it underwent a
massive refurbishment.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, Ben Affleck shot scenes for his upcoming movie
"Daredevil" on the second floor. The actor and film crew were cordial
enough. But the looky-loos drove coffee clerk Jennifer Barnych nuts.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, I was here," she said, rolling her eyes from behind the
counter at Giuliano's Delicatessen &amp; Bakery, where Affleck set up his
chair for part of the day. "I wish I wasn't. Word seemed to get out
among the entire female population of the building, and they all came
down here to see him."</LD>
<TE>   Such commotion--which crowds hallways, can disrupt city business
and annoys or thrills employees--is a common sight at City Hall, a
popular filming location for Hollywood producers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its proximity to the studios and the stars, the
recently rehabilitated landmark can take on many looks, from a solemn
courtroom to the halls of Congress to the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely popular," said Morrie Goldman, vice president of
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., a Hollywood-based
organization that coordinates filming throughout Southern California.
"The rotunda and the council chambers and the Public Works
boardroom--they have tremendous versatility. It's a great building."</TE>
<TE>   The site--full of Italian marble, gleaming bronze, Malibu tiles
and ornately painted ceilings--has been a convenient and popular
filming locale since it opened in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   The 452-foot tower was the headquarters of the Daily Planet in the
1950s "Superman" television show. Among City Hall's other credits are
the movies "War of the Worlds" and "L.A. Confidential," and the TV
shows "Kojak," "Cagney &amp; Lacey" and "Spin City."</TE>
<TE>   Before it closed in 1998 for a massive, $299-million restoration
and earthquake retrofitting, filming occurred more than once a week
on average.</TE>
<TE>   Since the rehabilitation was finished last year, part of the "West
Wing" season premiere was shot there, as were scenes for "Anger
Management" with Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler and "Time Cop 2"
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.</TE>
<TE>   City employees' reactions run from starry-eyed to annoyed.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba Gholston, a senior clerk typist with the Board of Public
Works, falls into both categories.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disruptive," she said. "Some people are obnoxious. They kind
of take over. They think they can do whatever they want."</TE>
<TE>   She said that a trip down the hall to the ladies' room can become
an expedition and that the crews often wander into areas where they
are not allowed.</TE>
<TE>   After a day's filming in the ornate Public Works boardroom, which
has church-like pews, the board's property is often moved around, and
sometimes missing.</TE>
<TE>   But Gholston softens when she talks about encounters with some
celebrities, such as getting her picture taken with James Earl Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine Rodriguez, an executive secretary in the building,
agreed that filming can be disruptive. But she says it's
understandable--and can be exciting.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was one of three Public Works employees chosen to be
extras in a Cinemax made-for-TV movie in 1988. They played nuns in a
movie about "Saturday Night Live" character Father Guido Sarducci.
After an audition, makeup and wardrobe--"They made us wear glasses to
look more nun-like"--the three spent more than four hours on the set.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they may shoot a scene that lasts mere minutes during
a movie--or one that winds up on the cutting room floor--filmmakers
pay the city $300 a day to shoot at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   They must also pay for any damage they cause, which is routine,
said Kevin Jew, chief operating officer for Project Restore, the
nonprofit group responsible for the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy equipment often scratches marble floors, or worse. After one
shoot, there was a hole in a marble baseboard near a third-story
stairwell. Making matters worse, the chunk that had been knocked out
could not be found.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, some leftover marble from another floor looked somewhat
similar and was carved to fill the slot, Jew said.</TE>
<TE>   That stairwell leads to the ornate rotunda, which was one of three
City Hall locations that appeared in John Travolta's "A Civil
Action," and was turned into the Vatican in "The Thorn Birds."</TE>
<TE>   Hilda Delgado, who works in Mayor James K. Hahn's press office on
the third floor, said watching this transformation is the best part.
"It gives you perspective on the magic of Hollywood," she said.</TE>

<HD>Wildfires Burning Across the State</HD>
<DH>Safety: Three blazes consume several homes and more than
7,000 acres, and force road closures, evacuations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wildfire burned 600 acres of forest land Sunday and at least
temporarily caused the closure of Interstate 15 in San Bernardino,
fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, fire officials expect to fully contain a wildfire that
destroyed five homes and forced evacuations of 200 people in Lake
Isabella by Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   And a wind-whipped, 3,000-acre forest fire forced the closure of
U.S. 395 and the evacuation of about 100 homes Sunday in the Sierra
resort community of Walker, about 90 miles south of Reno.</LD>
<TE>   About 300 firefighters were dispatched about 3 p.m. Sunday to
battle the blaze burning on both sides of the highway near Cajon
Boulevard in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Both northbound and southbound lanes of Interstate 15 were closed,
and highway patrol officers were redirecting drivers to alternate
routes, said Karen McKinley, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was threatening a radio tower, but no other structures
were threatened, McKinley added. There was no immediate estimate of
containment.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was under investigation, McKinley said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lake Isabella blaze was at least 50% contained by Sunday
afternoon. Firefighters faced hot weather and winds of up to 15 mph
as they battled the fire that exploded from a few acres to 3,500
acres.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, which started Saturday about 1 p.m., abated after
sundown, and residents were allowed to return home at night, said
Kern County Fire Department spokesman Chris Cagle.</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out in dry grass and brush near California 178 and
Borel Canyon Road northeast of Bakersfield. The cause was under
investigation, Cagle said.</TE>
<TE>   Five homes and four vehicles, along with garages, a travel
trailer, mobile home, five sheds, two boats and a barn were
destroyed. Campgrounds in Keysville were evacuated as the fire moved
into that area.</TE>
<TE>   No other buildings were threatened.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Kern County sheriff's deputies enforced mandatory
evacuations in parts of Bodfish and Lake Isabella. Residents gathered
at the town's senior center, which was converted into a temporary
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Air tankers and helicopters, along with 300 firefighters, battled
the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Isabella is a resort community of about 3,500 residents in
the southern Sierra Nevada about 30 miles northeast of Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   In Walker, Mono County Sheriff's Sgt. Boe Turner said some homes
were burning late Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials could only confirm that three buildings, an
outbuilding and a propane-storage area were on fire.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was burning five miles southwest of Walker on Sunday
morning, and was pushed quickly toward town by high, erratic winds,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze broke out Saturday afternoon in the Toiyabe National
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire has really moved," said Laura Williams of the Sierra
Front Interagency Dispatch Center in Minden, Nev. "The winds got very
fast and powerful and moved it right into town."</TE>
<TE>   Turner said all homes west of U.S. 395 in Walker were evacuated
around 3 p.m. Sunday. Homes east of the highway could be evacuated at
any time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The highway, which runs through Walker, was closed from near the
Nevada line to Bridgeport.</TE>
<TE>   Turner said the fire was moving north and also threatening homes
in nearby Coleville, where residents also faced evacuations.</TE>
<TE>   A shelter for evacuees was set up at Antelope Valley Elementary
School.</TE>

<HD>Priest Scandal Echoes Family's Decade of Pain</HD>
<DH>Crime: Parents learned that a trusted cleric had molested
four of their sons. They have pursued changes in church policies on
sex abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of the nation has been shocked by this year's revelations of
priest sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. Bill and Judy weren't.</LD>
<LD>   The east San Fernando Valley couple has lived with the
consequences of Father Richard Allen Henry's betrayal for more than a
decade. He was a close family friend who earned the trust of their
sons. Then he molested four of them one by one. The parents responded
by becoming more active in their church and trying to keep Henry from
going to prison.</LD>
<LD>   The family's experience is a textbook case in the pain errant
priests and an overly protective church have caused. Some of this was
on display in Dallas last week  when America's Catholic bishops,
debating a new child-abuse policy, were addressed by victims whose
hurt and confusion echoed Bill's and Judy's.</LD>
<TE>   The case of Father Richard Allen Henry resonates because it
involved individuals who are still enmeshed in the abuse crisis,
which has put more than 50 current and former Los Angeles archdiocese
priests under suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   The key figures are:</TE>
<TE>   * Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and his top representatives, who went
to great lengths to protect Father Henry. The archdiocese paid his
$30,000 bail and therapy bills and kept his identity secret by never
announcing his departure from the parish. The archdiocese also made
little effort to remove Henry from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   * Bill and Judy, who went on to become founding members of
Mahony's Sexual Abuse Misconduct Board, which reviews cases involving
clergy abuse. The parents, who are still members of the board, say
that their activism was fueled by a desire to ensure that no more
children would be abused by priests. Their last names are being
withheld under a Times policy of protecting the identities of victims
of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, then a supervising
prosecutor, who attended Henry's court hearings and successfully
pushed for a maximum eight-year prison sentence. Today Cooley decides
whether to file charges on complaints of clergy abuse.</TE>
<TE>   * Henry's lawyer, Donald Steier, who represents most of the former
and current priests who are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Henry, who lives in Maryland, is among the few priests in the
three-county Los Angeles archdiocese to be convicted of child
molestation. (The archdiocese has identified only one other convicted
priest: a man who was placed on 10 years probation and committed to a
state mental hospital for two years in 1983.)</TE>
<TE>   Bill and Judy's ordeal began on a late summer evening in 1991 when
the police arrived at their door in Sunland. The big
family--including four daughters, four adopted children and three
foster children--were outside taking wedding photos of one daughter
and her husband.</TE>
<TE>   The police told them the priest had been molesting several of
their children.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't believe it," Bill said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Continuing Pattern</TE>
<TE>   Father Henry was the 40-year-old associate pastor at Bill and
Judy's church, Holy Redeemer in Montrose, when he befriended the
family in 1985. He soon began taking the boys to baseball games and
he attended family barbecues and pool parties. He baby-sat while Judy
ran errands. And then, a few months after meeting the family, he
began abusing their oldest son, an altar boy.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, Henry molested the boy in church, at the rectory
and on trips to San Diego and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   When that boy reached puberty, the priest turned his attention to
a younger sibling. Then a younger one. The pattern continued even
after Henry was reassigned from Holy Redeemer to another church.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after six years, one of the younger boys told his
biological parents during a weekend visit. They told a nurse at a
mental health clinic who alerted authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Police interviewed all 11 children that night in 1991. The
children told police they were scared that the family would be torn
apart; two of the boys Henry was accused of abusing were foster
children who had been previously abused.</TE>
<TE>   Bill had grown up at Holy Redeemer as an altar boy. The family
attended Mass regularly. Several of the children went to Catholic
school. Bill and Judy loved a house full of friends and family. They
were committed to helping children in need.</TE>
<TE>   "And now," Judy said, "we hear this."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials say that Henry confessed hours after the
police came to Bill and Judy's home. He was arrested by Los Angeles
police and booked into County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   His first visitor was Cardinal Mahony. Henry had asked to see him.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to apologize for what he had done and all the harm he
had done to these boys," the cardinal said recently. "He was quite
subdued."</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks the family returned to Holy Redeemer. Henry had been
gone since 1986, when he was transferred to Our Lady of the Rosary in
Paramount. The church never formally told parishioners at either
church about Henry's arrest--not even after the parents started
sharing their story.</TE>
<TE>   Bill, 59, and Judy, 53, talk about those days with a calm, earnest
focus. They say they thought that a lone priest--not the Catholic
Church--failed them. They say they never desired vengeance, but were
determined to help the church understand how much hurt priest sex
abuse caused families.</TE>
<TE>   For all Judy's patience, when Mahony sent two representatives,
including the vicar in charge of personnel, to her home, she was
repulsed.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I'm going to kill them.' I never wanted another priest
in my home again. Ever," she recalled recently. "I said, 'Please
leave.' "</TE>
<TE>   They left but gave her the name of a psychologist. Once the
parents' anger cooled, they arranged therapy sessions. For more than
six months, seven children saw seven therapists once a week. The
parents attended weekly therapy sessions together. Every three weeks,
the family went as a group. The archdiocese paid for all of it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a question nagged at Bill and Judy, a question they needed
to ask the priest.</TE>
<TE>   How could you?</TE>
<TE>   Henry had entered a not-guilty plea to four felony counts of lewd
acts upon a child. The archdiocese had put up his bail, and Henry had
been released to an archdiocese retreat house. Bill and Judy went to
see him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Why Did You Do This?'</TE>
<TE>   "One side of me wanted to jump up and strangle him," Judy said,
"and the other side"--her voice dropped, its anger exhausted--"saw
this young man, like one of the boys."</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation lasted 90 minutes. She yelled at him, "Why did
you do this?" He was remorseful and apologetic, the parents said. All
three cried.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, Henry changed his plea to no contest,
essentially a guilty plea. Judge Howard J. Schwab ordered him to a
weeklong evaluation program at St. Luke Institute, a Maryland-based
treatment center for clergy members, before sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Back in court, Henry's lawyer, Steier, sought probation. Instead,
the judge again postponed sentencing, ordering Henry to St. Luke's
for a six-month treatment program. The archdiocese paid for the
treatment, according to documents, at a cost of several hundred
dollars a day.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the parents were incensed. Then they decided to visit
St. Luke's, to decide whether Henry was being treated or merely
hiding. They read books about child abuse, met with experts on
pedophilia, talked to therapists.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting lasted 4 1/2 hours, according to a confidential report
prepared by a St. Luke's psychologist for the archdiocese. It said
Henry "was responsive to their confrontation ... and understood how
he had affected the family."</TE>
<TE>   The children had already suffered before we took them in, Judy
says she told Henry, "and you took them and did it again. How could
you do that?"</TE>
<TE>   When Henry returned to California for sentencing, the parents
joined his lawyer, the archdiocese and the psychologists from St.
Luke's in urging the judge to keep Henry out of prison. Continued
therapy was the only remedy for controlling this incurable condition,
Judy says. "They just perfect their pedophilia in prison." Only the
district attorney's office and one probation officer recommended
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Henry, who began as a pastor in Long Beach in 1972, was described
by friends, family and associates in pre-sentencing reports as smart
and extremely remorseful.</TE>
<TE>   None of that mattered to Cooley, the supervising deputy district
attorney in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Therapist's Report</TE>
<TE>   "Eliminate the fact that he was a member of the clergy and what do
you have? You have a serial child molester," Cooley said in a recent
interview. "Everything else is irrelevant.... I didn't see any
difference between other pedophiles and Richard Henry."</TE>
<TE>   As district attorney, Cooley said, the same standard will apply.
"We're not going to carve out special wink-and-nod situations for
certain professions."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of Henry's sentencing in April 1993, Bill told Judge
Schwab that he and Judy were "here to see justice done. I think other
kids need the chance to have him rehabilitated rather than just
locked up, and eight years from now getting out feeling bitter,
desperate and going back to whatever he felt like doing."</TE>
<TE>   Among the documents submitted to Schwab was a report by a
therapist at St. Luke's, who said Henry had "a good beginning in
understanding just how hostile and abusive he was toward children and
has developed some empathy for his victims." The psychologist
recommended that Henry continue individual and group therapy and that
he "not be alone in the presence of people under the age of 18."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Probation Urged</TE>
<TE>   Henry, the therapist wrote, was beaten and verbally abused as a
child. He also said Henry never advanced emotionally beyond
adolescence--a syndrome that has been associated with many cases of
priestly abuse. "From a psychological point of view, it is not
surprising that he molested."</TE>
<TE>   Father Timothy Dyer, the vicar of clergy, admitted that the
archdiocese had no plan for how to handle Henry but urged Schwab to
give the priest probation. "The archdiocese is prepared to work with
Mr. Henry, if we have the opportunity to do that, to make sure, first
of all, that he is far from children, far from teenagers while he
continues in a therapeutic setting."</TE>
<TE>   Henry told the judge: "I wish, I wish with all my heart I could
erase what I did with the kids, that it never happened ... take it
away, go back in time. I can't. The only thing I can do is get in
recovery, heart and soul."</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Steier, acknowledged that his client was "a sick
guy.... It's an illness. He acted wrong. He's sick. That's why the
treatment is so important and he won't get the treatment in state
prison."</TE>
<TE>   Steier today says that he was calling for "an enlightened
approach.... You've got the chance to treat it like you would an
alcoholic--you can't cure him, but you can treat him. It's an
absolute shame that we have to go through this eye-for-an-eye
approach."</TE>
<TE>   Schwab disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "To me what happened here is a tragedy of the utmost degree," the
judge said. "It has torn everyone apart. It is tearing me apart right
here.... But what happened is a human being took advantage of a
position of trust.... I feel his actions over the ... years were
predatory, I really do.... He committed these acts knowing that the
children were vulnerable.... This is what breaks my heart."</TE>
<TE>   With that, he sentenced Henry to eight years in state prison. It
was a measure of how little attention priestly abuse attracted a
decade ago that media coverage was scant. The Times, for example,
published a short article on the seventh page of an edition
circulated in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after arriving in prison, Henry was stabbed in a fight;
his lawyer contends that the inmates knew immediately he was a child
molester. He received little or no therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess that's justice," Steier said sarcastically.</TE>
<TE>   Henry was released on parole in August 1996. Mahony said the
archdiocese sent Henry a letter at the time to inform him of the
procedures to remove him from the priesthood, but he never responded.
Under canon law, Mahony said, the priest is entitled to respond and
to have an advocate speak on his behalf. That has not happened.
(Mahony said he and other bishops have asked the Vatican to speed the
process.)</TE>
<TE>   "After he got out of prison, he disappeared from us," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   But The Times found Henry. Now 56, he lives in Montgomery County,
Maryland. He declined to discuss his life. "It was a very painful
time in my life and for the people I hurt. I really don't want to
discuss it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Failing to Register</TE>
<TE>   While he is a registered sex offender in California, Henry has
failed to register in Maryland. Under that state's law, a serious sex
offender registered in another state must still register in Maryland
if the crime occurred before 1997. The Maryland Department of Public
Safety and Corrections is looking into the matter, along with local
police, after inquiries by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Bill and Judy found Henry too. They visited him while he was
undergoing treatment at St. Luke's after he was released from prison.</TE>
<TE>   The parents saw their children through adulthood. "We are
survivors," Bill said.</TE>
<TE>   They say that they have stayed on the cardinal's abuse misconduct
board to continue pushing for change. They speak to gatherings of
priests because they want the church to forthrightly acknowledge the
victims in these cases--not to be dragged into it. Recently, the
board pressured the archdiocese to adopt a policy of informing
parishioners when their priest is transferred because of a
child-abuse investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Bill and Judy say that the board is planning to review all the
archdiocese's older abuse cases to determine how they were
handled--or mishandled. They want to know if they were lied to.</TE>
<TE>   The parents are dismayed that a brochure they helped write about
sexual abuse several years ago is only now being distributed to
parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal 11 years ago was the same as it is today," Judy said. "To
make sure no one else is abused by priests. That's it."</TE>
<TE>   For a second she thought about what she'd said.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not go out on a limb and say that this couldn't happen
again," she said. "It could."</TE>

<HD>Good Times on the Baja Coast</HD>
<DH>Tourism: The owner of a storied roadhouse decides to move
on. Faithful clientele say it just won't be the same.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA MISION, Mexico</DL>
<LD>It's Friday afternoon and Orest Dmytriw is balancing on a chair,
trying to plaster the ceiling of the crowded bar at his unique Baja
roadhouse, La Fonda.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, a chef emerges from the kitchen and announces in
breathless tones that a fisherman has arrived with a fresh 30-pound
halibut for sale.</LD>
<LD>   Clambering down and dusting off his hands, he tells his longtime
chef: "Buy it, filet it."</LD>
<TE>   Next, he pivots to face a just-arrived California couple, and with
a grand wave of his plaster covered hands, declares: "Welcome to
paradise, my friends."</TE>
<TE>   Those who know him regard the iconoclastic
Ukrainian-Canadian-American-Mexican and his inn as Baja classics; an
expatriate businessman of devilish wit who turned a jumble of
cliff-top rooms a few hours drive south of Los Angeles into a
hideaway where young and old come to get lost.</TE>
<TE>   So it shocked La Fonda's faithful clientele to learn that the old
hotel, whose 26 rooms are known by their whimsical features--the
Conversation Pit, the Killer Shower, the Lava Heart Over the Bed--is
on the market. For $3.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   After 27 years of catering to surfers, adventurers, Mexican
officials--and sharing moonshine tequila with the likes of U.S. Sens.
Ted Kennedy and Alan Simpson--the man some liken to Humphrey Bogart's
Rick in the film "Casablanca" has declared: "Llego el momento"--It's
time to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see too many 70-year-olds running Baja beer joints,"
said Dmytriw (pronounced duh-MEE-tree). "Now, I want to do some
things I haven't had time for: Go to a baseball game and eat a hot
dog. Take my wife out dancing."</TE>
<TE>   Between margaritas at a table overlooking the sea 50 feet below,
retired San Diego lifeguard B. Christmas Brewster, 46, said the place
won't be the same without the hotelier with the booming,
hard-to-place accent, who greets guests each evening in a jaunty navy
blazer, white slacks and Topsiders, sans socks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is it: the tavern in the dark of your imagination," Brewster
said. "The odd little roadside joint where crowds of strangers
welcome you as family. Only it's a family that doesn't tell tales."</TE>
<TE>   "The paintings in the bedraggled rooms are eccentric, some windows
don't close, and the warped mirrors don't reflect who you really are.
But there's a spirit here--Dmytriw's. It would be a tragedy if he
sold the place."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles musician Tracie Jackson, 38, who has been a frequent
patron for two decades, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started coming here with my friends, we'd spend
hours inventing stories about who Dmytriw might really be.
International spy? Mafioso?" Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's as mysterious and wonderful as his hotel. It'd be great if
it takes a hundred years to sell it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bought Hotel in 1975</TE>
<TE>   Dmytriw was a North Hollywood building contractor when he bought
La Fonda in 1975 after a 30-minute tour of the place, which sits so
close to the city limits of Rosarito Beach on the north and Ensenada
on the south that he pays taxes in both cities.</TE>
<TE>   "The previous owner wanted cash for the joint, so I went back to
the United States and sold everything I had," he recalled. "Years
later, she wrote me a letter that said, 'I'm so glad it's you. You're
a perfect fit.' "</TE>
<TE>   Orest and Sara Dmytriw conjured La Fonda's peculiar charm with
rooms of makeshift materials, bunched around steep, narrow stairways.</TE>
<TE>   The original rooms were built hacienda-style, but the rest came in
stages that could have been dreamed up by a Cubist painter--drinking
absinthe.</TE>
<TE>   The windowed shower stalls in rooms 18 and 19 offer a panoramic
view of the beach and an eyeful to strollers on the strand below.</TE>
<TE>   In one room, an arrow drawn in pencil on the wall used to point
toward a light switch hidden by a mirror frame.</TE>
<TE>   Guests unload cars in a cramped cobblestone parking area, then
trundle to their rooms with five-gallon containers of purified water,
ice chests, coffee makers and boomboxes.</TE>
<TE>   "If these walls could talk!" Dmytriw's wife said.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant sits atop the bluff--covered by thick banks of
bougainvillea and bamboo--overlooking the wide, rolling sea. There,
patrons sample banana pancakes topped with coconut syrup and
margaritas of alarming strength.</TE>
<TE>   Staffers still talk about the tipsy patron who fell off the
restaurant balcony and rolled down the hill to the water's edge,
laughing all the way.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, La Fonda had no telephones, not even in its
office.</TE>
<TE>   Fireworks were banned only a year ago, after a bottle rocket
looped backward and landed in the hotel's unclipped shrubbery,
igniting a fire that was put out by staffers and guests.</TE>
<TE>   Years of complaints forced Sara Dmytriw to relocate her menagerie
of domestic animals that honked, oinked and chirped at all hours of
the day.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, a flood washed out the bridges on the road leading in and
out of the place, leaving dozens of patrons stranded for several
days. Among them, the story goes, was a four-star U.S. Army general.
His deliverance came in the form of a helicopter, which the general
waved in with a red tablecloth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Kennedy a Guest</TE>
<TE>   Later, "after his divorce, Sen. Ted Kennedy used to come here all
the time," Dmytriw said. "A wonderful man."</TE>
<TE>   It was Kennedy, Dmytriw said, who urged Republican Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming to visit La Fonda during the Republican National
Convention in San Diego in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In a now laminated letter dated Sept. 5, 1996, Kennedy thanked the
Dmytriws for showing his friend a good time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so glad Senator and Mrs. Simpson had the chance to enjoy a
fantastic dinner at your wonderful restaurant," Kennedy wrote.
"According to the Simpsons, it's everything I remember it to be.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the Simpsons are Republicans, we both agree that La
Fonda is a thumbs up dining experience!"</TE>
<TE>   The Dmytriws, who live in a spacious home attached to the hotel
complex, were less enthused about discussing their recent problems
with members of a hotel workers union, which went on strike late last
year over a wage dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "Jimmy Hoffa would have been proud to have unions as strong as the
ones around here," Dmytriw said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Mexican law, the hotel was unable to replace the 92 workers
as long as its original kitchen and restaurant remained open for
business.</TE>
<TE>   Other resort owners watched in amazement earlier this year at
Dmytriw's slight of hand in resolving the stalemate: He bought out
the disgruntled workers, boarded up the old workplace, and
transformed the kitchen and living room in his own home into a new
bar and dining area, run by nonunion staffers.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent weekday, the new kitchen was being expanded by work
crews who were jostling for elbow room with cooks flipping lobsters
and sea bass for dinner guests.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loyal Patrons</TE>
<TE>   Such quirky rhythms have made loyal patrons of people such as
retired Costa Mesa real estate agent Terry McCardle, 62, and his
wife, Suzanne, 49.</TE>
<TE>   "We love it here. It's funky. Rundown. Dilapidated. Fun," McCardle
said. "Where else can you have chickens pecking at your toes while
you're eating dinner?"</TE>
<TE>   In the bar, under a ceiling glistening with wet plaster,
conversation is difficult because of the noise. Mariachis are
competing with the sounds of pounding surf and boisterous patrons,
dozens of whom are crowded around televisions tuned to a Lakers game.</TE>
<TE>   Dmytriw is nursing a whiskey and cola. Dressed casually in shorts,
untucked blue cotton shirt and loafers, he is looking out over the
sea and reflecting on changing times.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done what I wanted with this joint, which was to have a good
time and keep people happy and well-fed," he said. "Now, I just want
to spend some time being an old man. But I'm in no hurry to sell. I
love making people feel good."</TE>
<TE>   He turns to greet a group of new arrivals who are waiting to shake
his hand. "Hello there. I love you all," he said. "Seat your
beautiful selves down."</TE>

<HD>New Berkeley Center Pursues Study of Peace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CHON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>The timing may seem all wrong, the central notion sadly outdated, and
the setting too obvious for skeptics. But scholars at the University
of California's new Center for the Development of Peace and
Well-Being believe there's never been a better time for the
psychological study of positive attributes like love, gratitude and
compassion.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, in post-Sept. 11 America, where news of terrorism and war
have become a background hum of everyday life, they say now is the
time to give peace--and its scientific study--a chance.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of the most interesting ways in which people find peace and
well-being is in the context of trauma," says Dacher Keltner,
director of the center. "There are a lot of ways in which our work is
very germane to what's happening as a function of 9/11--the anxiety,
fragmentation, family disruption, nightmares. We can speak to that."</LD>
<TE>   Based in the traditionally liberal university's Department of
Psychology, Berkeley's peace center might seem to have incongruous
roots: It was founded with a $1-million grant from a real estate
developer who supported the election of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Ruth Ann Hornaday attended Berkeley in the early '60s,
as the free speech movement launched an era of liberal student
activism in America. Thomas Hornaday was stationed as a naval officer
at nearby Treasure Island. He said he was "anything but a hippie,"
while attending the university.</TE>
<TE>   Now a Phoenix real estate developer, Hornaday describes himself as
"a very conservative person, economically."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he has little patience with those who would ridicule a
center devoted to the study of peace. "There's a lot of shallow
thinking going on," he says. "If there's someone who pooh-poohs the
idea, they're probably in need of a deeper insight. I'm pretty
comfortable with it myself."</TE>
<TE>   The center recently hosted its first symposium--on "Children Who
Thrive in the Face of Adversity." And it is beginning to see the
first fruits of a fellowship program that has drawn interest from
student-scholars in various fields.</TE>
<TE>   But the center's most difficult challenge may be in establishing
its identity, and laying to rest doubts that its mission is now
somehow beside the point. It has tried to accomplish this by
acknowledging from the outset the new post-terrorist milieu.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody would think of peace if there wasn't conflict," observes
Philip Cowan, a UC psychologist who studies family issues. "Peace is
one state in life. The question is not just how do you get
there--because you don't stay there--but how it is connected, how in
the face of conflict, challenge and adversity you sometimes can get
some kind of deliverance."</TE>
<TE>   Cowan and Keltner say their think tank is not about solutions to
global conflicts but, rather, about the individual's peace of mind.
From the latter, they hope, might come the former.</TE>
<TE>   Future topics of study will include: the development of love and
compassion, coping with significant personal loss, improving marital
and parent-child relationships, conflict resolution and pro-social
interactions in school and peer settings.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, balancing the rational and scientific with the warm and
fuzzy is no easy task. The center's founders insist it will be a
place for rigorous scientific study.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they acknowledge a nontraditional approach.</TE>
<TE>   "In my field, I study positive states," Keltner says. "Well, you
go to the scientific literature and there may be 800 studies on anger
and just 60 studies on reconciliation or gratitude. There are perhaps
12,000 studies of fear and only 70 studies of hope."</TE>
<TE>   The center scholars, scattered around the Berkeley campus, want to
spread their discussions off campus to parents, teachers and
health-care professionals. They plan to publish their studies in
nonscientific jargon.</TE>
<TE>   "We're bucking psychology," Cowan says. "We think this should have
some public relevance."</TE>
<TE>   Says Hornaday: "You've got to approach it at an individual level.
That's where peace starts. It's in the heart of you and me."</TE>

<HD>The Mayor Dribbles Out of Trouble at Staples</HD>
<DH>Hahn, on hand to watch the Lakers, gets a chilly response
as he wanders into luxury box full of political rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not all the action was on the basketball court during one of the
Staples Center matchups between the Lakers and Nets.</LD>
<LD>   In one box, you had Mayor James K. Hahn sitting with Tim Leiweke,
an executive of the firm that built Staples and one of the principals
seeking city assistance to build a downtown pro football stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn has said he supports the stadium project, but with the city
limited to using its powers to condemn land for the project and
issuing $100 million in municipal bonds to fund the land purchase, to
be repaid by the developers. Leiweke is pressing for the project but
warning that his group will back out if local governments don't rally
around it.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn wandered into a dramatic moment during the game. He dropped
into another luxury suite to find former Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa, who fought him in a bitter runoff election for mayor
last year, watching the game and talking to former Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks, who angrily stepped down recently after Hahn and
his Police Commission refused to back him for another term.</TE>
<TE>   Also part of that gathering, hosted by attorney Neil Papiano, was
county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who has been critical of the mayor
for opposing a fall vote on San Fernando Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   One observer said there were a few awkward moments after Hahn
realized that the luxury box was full of people with whom he had
clashed. The mayor, the observer said, seemed to receive an
especially chilly response from Parks' wife, Bobbie. Hahn stayed a
few moments, then left to rejoin Leiweke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GOP Infighting</TE>
<TE>   The infighting in the state Republican Party continues, with
California GOP Chairman Shawn Steel catching flak from four top party
leaders who felt he was playing into the Democrats' hands by being
critical of Republicans in an opinion piece in The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Steel's piece started off criticizing Democrats for holding up
qualified conservative judicial appointments. But he went on to put
some of the blame on President Bush's top political operative in
California, attorney Gerald L. Parsky, for recommending bipartisan
committees to review the appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn called the bipartisan committees a "half-baked" idea that
has allowed Democrats to stall appointments.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Steel obtained by The Times, California Republican
Party board members Bill Jones, Jim Brulte, Dave Cox and Bill Black
said they "strongly disapprove" of his actions.</TE>
<TE>   The board members who signed the letter hold some clout. Jones is
secretary of state, Brulte is Senate Republican leader, Cox is
Assembly Republican leader and Black is the party vice chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "Your opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times was divisive and will
work against the unity that is so necessary to our victory in
November," said the letter, dated May 31. "Such public attacks on
other Republican leaders demoralize our volunteer base, erode donor
confidence in the state party and de-motivate Republican voters."</TE>
<TE>   The four leaders called on Steel to cease such activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It continues a pattern of behavior that you have previously been
asked to curtail," the letter added ominously--and just a few days
later Steel was ousted from the Republican National Committee's
executive board.</TE>
<TE>   Steel stood by his opinion piece.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never happy when one Republican attacks another and, in this
case, my fondest hope is that those who signed the letter defending
Mr. Parsky actually read the article," Steel said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Watergate at 30</TE>
<TE>   Today is the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in, and where
better to commemorate it than the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba
Linda?</TE>
<TE>   The privately funded presidential library sent out a news release
offering advance interviews with Executive Director John H. Taylor
and access to its galleries and archival material.</TE>
<TE>   For those born after 1974, the break-in at Democratic Party
offices in the Washington hotel by Republican operatives with the
Committee to Re-elect the President exposed a web of scandals and
eventually forced Nixon's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The library in recent months has been at the center of a legal
dispute between Nixon's two daughters over a $19-million bequest from
longtime family friend Charles "Bebe" Rebozo that they disagreed how
to spend.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor got snared in the middle, with an attorney for Tricia Nixon
Cox accusing him of Machiavellian maneuvers to take control of the
money and complaining that the library didn't engage in enough
"scholarly pursuits."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spinmeister Central</TE>
<TE>   Republican spinmeister Dan Schnur, who once compared supporters of
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan to a blond on a barstool (they'd
let him buy them drinks but wouldn't go home with him), has teamed
with three other thirtysomething political spokesguys to form a new
Sacramento consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Schnur in CommandFocus--named for a Lee Atwater-ism--are
Rob Stutzman, a senior advisor to the state GOP; Jeff Flint, a senior
strategist with the Simon for governor campaign; and Mark Bogetich,
who was chief of opposition research for former gubernatorial
candidate Secretary of State Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Potty Training</TE>
<TE>   Lots of bathroom talk at a recent meeting of the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman John Flynn was fixated on an article he had read
about how easily food-borne illness is spread when people don't wash
their hands after using the potty.</TE>
<TE>   So Flynn called for a study on how much it would cost to put signs
in every public restroom in the county informing folks that they'd be
to blame for spreading intestinal and upper respiratory infections if
they failed to lather up.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster his argument, he called in county Public Health Officer
Robert Levin, who estimated that there are 150,000 local cases of
food-borne illness every year and 50 million nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure I'm not standing in restrooms counting people
go in and out," Flynn told his colleagues as the audience tittered
and groaned.</TE>
<TE>   "But I do notice that many people, maybe 50%, don't touch the
sink."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal didn't wash well with Supervisor Judy Mikels, the
board's staunchest less-government-is-better member.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, come on," she muttered. "Let's not police the world." In the
end, however, she and the rest of the board agreed to order the
study.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo suggested naming the study for his
colleague: "We might want to refer to it as John's john policy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken:</TE>
<TE>   * Look for Los Angeles Ethics Commissioner David Fleming to step
down from the panel later this month so he can play a role in the
upcoming campaign for San Fernando Valley secession. The Studio City
attorney is prohibited from contributing to or otherwise
participating in any city political campaign while he serves on the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   * After serving for 18 years in Congress, Rep. Ron Packard could
be honored with a post office in Oceanside bearing his name. Rep.
Darrell Issa (R-Vista) introduced the bill that would name the postal
building after his predecessor, who became only the fourth write-in
candidate in U.S. history to win a House seat. Packard retired in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   * Valley VOTE executive committee member J. Richard Leyner is one
of six people who so far have filed papers with Los Angeles to begin
raising money for campaigns for the City Council proposed for the new
Valley city. Leyner, past chairman of the United Chambers of Commerce
of the San Fernando Valley, filed for the Encino area's 13th District
seat. Jerry England and Gene Venderford have filed for the 3rd
District, Ken A. McAlpine has filed for the 5th District and Garrett
R. Biggs and Jay H. Rosenzweig have filed for the 8th District seat.</TE>
<TE>   * Was it a resignation letter or a campaign flier? That's what
some in Sacramento wondered about a letter submitted by Elias S.
Cortez notifying Gov. Gray Davis of his plan to resign as director of
the state Department of Information Technology. "I remain your loyal
supporter and wish you continued success, including your reelection
this fall," Cortez wrote, offering his continued assistance in
another form.</TE>
<TE>   * Jerry Rubin and his attorney were in federal court last week
arguing his lawsuit against the city of Santa Monica for refusing to
allow him to use the words "peace activist" as his career designation
when he ran for City Council two years ago. Rubin said his civil
rights were violated by the city clerk. "I feel it's unfair for the
state elections code to disallow the use of the word activist," Rubin
said. "That's what I am."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quotable Quote:</TE>
<TE>   "As a mother of four, I know perfection is not an option."</TE>
<TE>   --Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), top Democrat on the House
intelligence subcommittee on terrorism and homeland security, calling
for speedy approval of legislation to create a Department of Homeland
Security.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Ridder, 87; Owner of Champion Thoroughbreds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Georgia Ridder, the widow of newspaper publisher B.J. "Ben" Ridder
who continued racing their large stable of thoroughbreds after her
husband's death to win dozens of important horse races including the
1996 Breeders' Cup Classic, has died. She was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Ridder died Friday night of natural causes at her home in
Pasadena, according to her son, Bernard J. "Barney" Ridder Jr.</LD>
<LD>   The Ridders, who moved from Long Island, N.Y., to California in
1955 when Ben became publisher of the Pasadena Independent &amp; Star
News, plunged into racing in the late 1950s. Their best horse might
have been Flying Paster, whose misfortune was to be born the same
year as Spectacular Bid.</LD>
<TE>   But the Ridder stable's biggest win came in 1996, when Alphabet
Soup, a longshot gray colt, beat Cigar, the reigning horse of the
year, and other top horses in the $4-million Breeders' Cup Classic at
Woodbine in suburban Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sacrilegious, beating a horse like Cigar, isn't it?" Georgia
Ridder said after the race. "But if somebody was going to do it, I'm
glad it was us."</TE>
<TE>   Ridder succeeded her husband on the board of the Oak Tree Racing
Assn. after his death in 1983, and in recent years remained an
emeritus member. The board conducts an annual fall racing meet at
Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "I would send her everything regular board members would get,
including minutes of the meetings, and she would read it all," said
Sherwood Chillingworth, executive vice president of Oak Tree. "Then
when we would see each other at the track, she was able to discuss
the issues as though she hadn't missed a meeting."</TE>
<TE>   When Alphabet Soup was to run in the Breeders' Cup, Ridder, who
had undergone knee-replacement surgery earlier in the year, was
reluctant to make the long trip to Canada to see the race. But
Chillingworth encouraged her to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Then when the horse won," Chillingworth said, "she was afraid to
go to the post-race interview room, afraid that she wouldn't know
what to say. But she was fine and charmed everyone. She acted like a
Hollywood star once she got there."</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Flying Paster was the best 3-year-old in California--he
won the Santa Anita Derby--but when he went east to compete in the
Triple Crown his bete noire was Spectacular Bid, a powerful colt who
lost only four of 30 races in his career. Spectacular Bid won the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, with Flying Paster running fifth
and fourth in those races. Spectacular Bid didn't win the Belmont
Stakes, which Flying Paster skipped. In the winter of 1980,
Spectacular Bid came to California to win four races at Santa Anita,
with Flying Paster finishing second in them all.</TE>
<TE>   Chris McCarron, the Hall of Fame jockey who announced Saturday
that he would retire in another week, listed Flying Paster as one of
the best horses he ever rode.</TE>
<TE>   "He was underrated, and unlucky to be in the same class as
Spectacular Bid," McCarron said. "But he was a very good horse."</TE>
<TE>   Other top horses raced by the Ridder Thoroughbred Stable were
Cat's Cradle, Cascapedia, Winter Solstice and Raw Gold. Cascapedia
was voted an Eclipse Award, racing's highest honor, for best older
filly or mare in 1977, and Cat's Cradle was voted California horse of
the year in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Ridder owned Hidden Springs Ranch, a 165-acre property
about 4,500 feet above sea level in the San Jacinto Mountains. She
didn't believe in pushing young horses and encouraged her
trainers--Gordon Campbell had Flying Paster and David Hofmans cared
for Alphabet Soup--to go easy with their stock.</TE>
<TE>   "When Ben told me he was going into the breeding business, it
horrified me," Ridder said in an interview with The Times in 1996.
"But now I enjoy planning the matings for our mares. I wouldn't be
able to get by without racing. You can't just sit around and play
bridge all the time."</TE>
<TE>   B.J. Ridder was 70 when he died. "I never thought about a
dispersal sale [of their horses]," Georgia Ridder said in a 1997
interview with the Thoroughbred Times. "Flying Paster had just gone
to stud then."</TE>
<TE>   Ridder's activities were not restricted to horses. She was on the
board of the Pasadena Art Museum and the Pasadena Symphony Assn., and
also belonged to the Annandale Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Buck Ridder, an only child, was born on Dec. 5, 1914, in
Baltimore. Her mother was the former Mary Elizabeth Pue and her
father, Laurance Buck, invented the square, space-saving milk bottle.
After attending Ethel Walker School in Connecticut, she was married
in New York. Her husband had been a polo player at Princeton
University.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include sons Bernard J. "Barney" Ridder Jr. of
Huntington Beach and Michael Ridder of New York City, and two
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial contributions be made to the
Nature Conservancy of California or to Descanso Gardens in La Canada.</TE>

<HD>Theme Parks Wait for New Safety Rules</HD>
<DH>Regulations: Hearings begin anew this week to create
framework to enforce 1999 law. Patron advocates are warning of
loopholes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than three years after a hard-fought battle to pass an
amusement-park safety law, the state has not put in place the
regulations to enforce it.</LD>
<LD>   As regulators prepare to meet Thursday for another round of
hearings, they face criticism that they have bowed under the weight
of industry lobbying and have weakened previously planned safety
rules.</LD>
<LD>   "There was enough public pressure to get the law passed, but
there's no strong, politically powerful lobby to protect the
integrity of it," said Kathy Fackler, a La Jolla resident whose son
was injured at Disneyland in 1998, and who later founded the advocacy
group Saferparks. "What I'm seeing happen is the politically powerful
folk are picking critical pieces out of it or putting critical
loopholes in it."</LD>
<TE>   Fackler will be at Thursday's hearing in Sacramento to press for
tougher rules.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria and David Zucker, parents of a young boy who was severely
brain damaged almost two years ago after he toppled from a Disneyland
ride and was pinned under the car, also are expected to attend.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 law gives the state Division of Occupational Safety and
Health authority to investigate accidents at amusement parks and
require safety changes.</TE>
<TE>   Parks are required to report injuries and submit to routine ride
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Although the law took effect in January 2000 and theme parks are
reporting accidents, the specific rules and regulations are far from
complete.</TE>
<TE>   The first set of regulations--called administrative
regulations--has been adopted and outlines the requirements for the
reporting of accidents and regular inspections of rides.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the state Occupational Safety and Health Standards
Board will review the second set of regulations, a set of
instructions and requirements addressing ride safety, such as
maintenance records. A third set of regulations, yet to be drawn up,
will address penalties for parks that fail to comply.</TE>
<TE>   As of Friday, no industry officials had filed public comments on
the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland Resort officials said the regulations have "evolved
very well" and any concerns can be resolved. Disneyland spokesman Ray
Gomez would not specify those concerns, but said, "We look forward to
seeing the regulations finalized and implemented."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lengthy process, the division's special counsel, Len
Welsh, said he would rather be deliberate and lay solid groundwork
for the program, than throw together incomplete or unclear
regulations. "We are putting together a program for the first time,"
Welsh said. "It's not something you rush ahead to do."</TE>
<TE>   The process has been delayed because of several wording changes.
Each time major changes are made, the public is given additional time
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The program has already completed several accident investigations
and some ride inspections.</TE>
<TE>   These regulations stay true to the intent of the law, Welsh said,
and include strong language about restricting some rides or providing
additional warnings.</TE>
<TE>   A person's weight, height, age or health condition could create
higher risks for certain rides and each park must devise a plan to
determine who can ride. For example, some rides might have restraints
that don't work for very heavy people; in such a case, the park must
decide whether to change the restraints or prohibit larger people
from riding.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally don't think [the regulations] are watered down,"
Welsh said. "If anything, I think they're stronger than they were
last year."</TE>
<TE>   A key area of concern for Fackler is the requirement that parks
must report serious accidents. Before the law passed, the public had
no way of knowing how many accidents occurred at parks, which have
consistently described themselves as one of the safest forms of
family entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The regulations say that parks must immediately report ride
accidents that result in injury requiring medical service beyond
first aid.</TE>
<TE>   Fackler described that wording as vague and said it has already
resulted in varying interpretations of what must be reported. She
said she fears that some injuries, such as whiplash or brain
injuries, may fall through the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Welsh said, parks seem to be reporting everything; and
some are even going beyond what the law requires. Parks that fail to
report accidents can be cited by the state. Once final regulations
are in place, parks may also be subject to fines.</TE>
<TE>   Fackler said she is also alarmed by the state's assessment that
the regulations could have a "significant economic impact on
businesses."</TE>
<TE>   If that proves true, the board can consider exempting certain
parks from parts of the law.</TE>
<TE>   For Fackler, exemption is a frightening possibility.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, for example, the largest theme parks--Disney World,
Universal and Busch Gardens--are exempt from mandatory accident
reporting, although they have volunteered to submit a quarterly
report. Even so, the state has no power to investigate accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like they're looking to justify an exemption for theme
parks," Fackler said. "It's at the very least an open door."</TE>
<TE>   According to the state's figures, ongoing annual costs per ride
for compliance would be about $759 per ride--an amount Fackler
contends can be easily absorbed by multimillion-dollar amusement
parks.</TE>
<TE>   Welsh said the state is required to assess the financial impact of
regulations and he does not believe it will lead to any exemptions.
"If [the financial impact] is significant, it's barely significant,"
he said. "We're required to adopt the regulations anyway. We don't
think there's any reasonable alternative to what we've proposed."</TE>

<HD>School Makes Heroes of Troubled Teens</HD>
<DH>Education: Santa Ana students boost self-confidence by
donating their artwork, mentoring, and feeding the homeless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Failure no longer colors Eric Arevalo's identity.</LD>
<LD>   For five years, the 17-year-old spray-painted freeway overpasses
from Orange County to San Francisco with his moniker, Fale, chosen
because the Santa Ana youth had felt like a failure all his life. Now
he works with canvas and clay, creating seascapes, masks and
watercolors through the art program at Santiago Creek School in Santa
Ana.</LD>
<LD>   The alternative school, whose students also mentor disabled
children and feed the homeless, won an award from the county's Human
Relations Commission for helping bridge the gap between students and
the community and for helping build the teens' self-esteem.</LD>
<TE>   The 50 students at county-run Santiago Creek, the only alternative
school to win the commission's Bridges Award, have been removed from
mainstream middle and high schools for academic and emotional
problems. Many live in foster homes or have been abused, and some are
on probation, school officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't bad kids; they just need redirection," said teacher
Cyndie Borcoman. "So many are lost until they come here."</TE>
<TE>   The county commission founded the Bridges program in 1988 to
create a social-justice curriculum at mainstream and alternative
schools throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-two schools participate. Santiago Creek applied to the
program two years ago and established its charity programs with the
commission's support.</TE>
<TE>   The art that students create at the 5-year-old school can provide
a release for troubled youngsters' anger and, in some cases, has
turned their lives around, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Garcia was not involved in art before enrolling in Santiago
Creek. As he worked with volunteer Joni Herman one recent morning,
shading perspective into a pastel moon, he talked about a future that
includes studying art at Santa Ana College after graduating this
month. "I was a menace when I was a little boy," said Garcia, 18, of
Santa Ana. "But now, even if I'm just painting turtles or something,
it gets my mind off of all those violent emotions."</TE>
<TE>   Through the school's outreach programs, Garcia has traveled to
Corona del Mar to mentor disabled teens and served food to the
homeless at a Santa Ana shelter. The experiences made him feel needed
for the first time in his life, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never gone somewhere that people even wanted me to be around,
but at those places, people needed my help," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't judging me, calling me a thug or a loser. They
wanted to share their lives with me."</TE>
<TE>   When Garcia and a dozen other Santiago Creek boys, all Latinos
with shaved heads and baggy pants, walked into the Newport Beach YMCA
two months ago in a mostly white, middle-class neighborhood, the desk
staff appeared less than thrilled, students and school officials
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   But when the boys presented an 8-by-60-foot seascape to beautify
the pool area, they erased the stereotypes society tends to have
about alternative-school students, said Jon Voget, the Central Orange
Coast YMCA's executive director. Borcoman proposed the mural last
year to YMCA officials, who chose the Newport Beach location.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids that came are not your typical artists," Voget said. "I
had been a little bit concerned about how the mural would look, but
we were pleasantly surprised by how much time and care the youth took
to do really nice work."</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating prejudices is one of the Bridges program's goals, said
Rigo Maldonado, a county human-relations specialist who works with
Santiago Creek. School officials are proposing a mentorship program
at the Santa Ana shelter, in which students would create art with the
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "It builds the kids' self-esteem because they stop thinking of
themselves as screwed-up and unwanted and start perceiving themselves
as heroes."</TE>
<TE>   The other schools chosen for this year's Bridges award are
Fullerton Union High School; Savannah High School in Anaheim, Kraemer
Middle School in Placentia and Orangethorpe Elementary in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Each winner received a plaque, a county Board of Supervisors
proclamation and $500.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago Creek's art program has helped students such as Arevalo
find avenues for their aggression.</TE>
<TE>   All of Arevalo's creations--still-life fruit sculptures trimmed
with dingy bricks, desert paintings with nails protruding from a
cactus--reflect his love of evil, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Evil represents me," said Arevalo, who has sold some of his works
through local galleries. "But now I don't feel so hopeless, such a
failure, because the school has shown me how to use these feelings to
do something that supports my family, rather than get me busted."</TE>
<TE>   Arevalo and other students are working on another mural for the
Newport Beach YMCA that features wildlife. Art instructor Lisa Albert
asks the students to keep some of their darker feelings out of work
that will be donated, but said that as long as students master the
basics, such as perspective and proportion, they can do as they
please with their private work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not here to judge or confine them," said Albert, a Newport
Beach artist. "They need structure, but they also need freedom of
expression more than most students."</TE>

secession, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has solicited
contributions ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 from companies and
lobbyists who do business with the city government.</LD>
<LD>   Those donations are building the L.A. United campaign treasury for
the Nov. 5 election, when voters will consider both breakaway
efforts. To win, the secession drives must carry a majority of voters
in their own areas and in the city overall.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn would not comment on his fund-raising, but the manager of his
anti-secession campaign defended the mayor's solicitations as legal
and appropriate. Los Angeles ethics rules cap contributions to
candidates, but do not limit donations to issue campaigns such as the
pro- and anti-secession efforts.</LD>
<TE>   The groups pressing for Hollywood and the Valley to leave Los
Angeles also are raising money, and are taking advantage of a
technicality in election rules to delay the disclosure of
contributions they accept. As a result, the financial supporters of
secession might not be made public until October.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents, by contrast, will reveal their next
disclosure statement in late July, when they report the sources of
contributions received in the six months ending June 30. Crucial to
that fund-raising drive, say business leaders, lobbyists and others,
have been Hahn's personal solicitations.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor is "asking for 25 grand and up," said a Los Angeles
business executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. The executive
added that larger corporations and a major bank were asked to
contribute "100 grand."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent conversation about secession, one City Hall
lobbyist said, Hahn asked him to raise a specific sum for the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn strategist Kam Kuwata said the mayor's phone calls are
"totally appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   "He's always known the line, and never crossed the line," Kuwata
said. "There's no correlation with what they say and how he treats
people's issues. He's always going to treat people's issues on the
merits."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata added that "it would not surprise me" if Hahn were asking
for as much as $100,000 from business interests.</TE>
<TE>   He said the mayor's message in the phone calls is simple: "We have
a great city, and we need to keep the city together. Will you help
our campaign to keep the city united?"</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Katz, head of a campaign committee promoting Valley
secession, criticized the mayor's fund-raising. "There may be nothing
illegal about it, but it sure raises questions of propriety," Katz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Katz noted that the mayor has the power to sign or veto
legislation covering everything from business taxes to zoning
changes. Katz, a former state assemblyman, said he has been told by
several business leaders contacted by Hahn that they feel they have
no choice but to contribute. "There is no such thing as a casual
phone call from the mayor," Katz said. "Pressure doesn't have to be
applied. It's assumed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'About the Power Elite'</TE>
<TE>   The secession advocate said Hahn's fund-raising is not a surprise.
"This has always been about the power elite and the rest of the city.
The downtown business community--those with access to City Hall and
the mayor--have a vested interest in seeing that the powers that be
are the powers that continue."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Schatz, president and chief executive officer of the Central
City Assn., said her members--primarily downtown businesses--have
received calls from Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is absolutely right in making these requests," she
said. "Our members are responding very positively."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's predecessor, Mayor Richard Riordan, also sought financial
assistance for his efforts to reform the City Charter and elect a
slate of candidates to the Los Angeles school board.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Dana Reed said Hahn has made it clear that
the anti-secession campaign "is of critical importance to him."</TE>
<TE>   "Our clients are supportive of the mayor's efforts, and they are
anxious to participate," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall lobbyist John Ek said the firm of Rose &amp; Kindel, where
he works, has been asked to assist in raising money to fight
secession. He declined to identify who sought the donation for the
L.A. United campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been approached by a number of people and are out there
raising money against secession," he said. Ek represents United
Airlines and other interests at Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to direct requests, the mayor's anti-secession
campaign has sent invitations to its first major fund-raising event,
a reception and dinner next week at the posh City Club atop the Wells
Fargo Center downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "Please join Mayor James K. Hahn and L.A. United at a reception to
keep the great city of Los Angeles together," the invitation reads.</TE>
<TE>   The $1,000 reception and $10,000 "Angel's Circle" dinner June 25
will mark the start of what is expected to be a series of
fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   The enclosed reply card addressed to the mayor at his campaign
office notes that there are no contribution limits in the battle over
secession. "Corporate, labor union, [political action committee] and
individual contributions are accepted."</TE>
<TE>   By the close of the latest reporting period June 30, Kuwata said,
he expects the L.A. United campaign to have received $1.7 million to
$2.1 million in contributions. The goal is $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of a brief year-end campaign report filed by
the L.A. United committee in January, no contributions to the pro- or
anti-secession efforts have been reported. July 30 is the deadline
for filing a report disclosing campaign fund-raising and spending in
the first half of this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Contribution Reports</TE>
<TE>   But some pro-secession organizations say they might not file
campaign contribution reports until late in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A group of secessionists has formed the San Fernando Valley
Independence Committee. The organization is headed by Katz, a Valley
VOTE board member.</TE>
<TE>   LeeAnn Pelham, executive director of the Los Angeles Ethics
Commission, said no paperwork has been filed to form a fund-raising
committee supporting secession. The paperwork will be filed soon,
Katz said. He said his interpretation of the law is that until the
county Board of Supervisors votes to put secession on the ballot,
there is no requirement to disclose donors and amounts raised. That
vote is not scheduled until Aug. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Technically, we don't have to file until the measure is put on
the ballot Aug. 6," Katz said. "Legally, no one does. The mayor
doesn't have to."</TE>
<TE>   Katz said all contributions received by the pro-secession campaign
will eventually be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the anti-secession group One L.A. said it plans to
disclose soon who its donors are.</TE>
<TE>   The group's steering committee has agreed to disclose its
financing even though it is a nonprofit organization, not a campaign
committee subject to more detailed state disclosure laws, said
Jeffrey Daar, a founder of the group.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe in full disclosure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE is a nonprofit organization, not a campaign committee.
That means it cannot campaign for or against a ballot measure, but it
can conduct research and provide information about an issue. In the
past it has refused to disclose all of its donors.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, the group's chairman, said Valley VOTE has complied
with the law. Any disclosure not required by state law would have to
be approved by the group's board. Close declined to comment further
when asked whether the group will disclose what it receives.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Valley VOTE, any campaign committee formed by secessionists
to win passage of the cityhood ballot measure would have to disclose
donors and amounts for contributions of more than $100.</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission, which has approved
resolutions to put the Valley and Hollywood measures on the ballot,
has authority to adopt disclosure rules, but since its first meeting
in March 2001, a subcommittee dealing with the issue has not
reconvened.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Calemine, executive director of LAFCO, said that the last
action was a request for legal advice, but that because the advice
has not been received, the subcommittee has not met.</TE>
<TE>   "Until something is scheduled for the ballot, there is no
requirement for disclosure," Calemine said.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she will try to get
LAFCO to revisit the disclosure issue, but she noted that other
members have been reluctant to require Valley VOTE to disclose where
it got its money before an election was called.</TE>
<TE>   "We should know who in the world is paying for all this," Burke
said, adding that without disclosure, "I don't think the true basis
for secession will come to the forefront."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Woocher, an attorney specializing in election law, said that
in traditional initiatives, groups do not have to disclose financing
until a measure is put on the ballot, but then they have to disclose
all that was raised previously, including the cost of the petition
drive.</TE>
<TE>   "There certainly is an argument that there should be the same
situation here," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Fortune Lost--Then a Legal Knot</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jim Slemons, the epitome of Orange County success
in the '80s, spent the '90s in a financial hall of mirrors. He vows
'to make a comeback somewhere.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was the quintessential Newport Beach entrepreneur: owner of a
flourishing Mercedes-Benz empire and a jet-setter who married six
times, kept an 83-foot yacht at Newport Harbor and boasted a string
of showplace homes.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Slemons, whose name defined success in Orange County in the
1980s, told a Superior Court jury this year that any shred of the
$87-million fortune he had amassed by 1988 was gone. He was so broke
last year, he said, he had been living out of his car in Honolulu,
sleeping in a park near Waikiki Beach.</LD>
<LD>   It was a spectacular fall from grace--and a second one at that.</LD>
<TE>   Slemons, 69, is now vowing to pursue the people he said duped him
after his business empire collapsed in 1991, his first lost fortune.
His second loss came years later, the details emerging over four
months as he sat as a defendant in Orange County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   It was only then, he said, that he discovered $4 million had come
and gone in his name, without him knowing a thing about it. "I'm not
going to lay down and say, 'Poor me,' " he said. "I'm going to make a
comeback somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Riddell, a marketing executive from Huntington Beach, sued
Slemons as well as attorney Francis K. "Guy" Friedemann,
father-and-son businessmen Merritt C. "Chuck" and M.C. "Chad" Horning
and their company, Newport Federal Financial of Newport Beach, in
February 2000, along with various corporations owned by the
defendants. The suit accused them of concocting an elaborate scheme
to manipulate Slemons' assets while he allegedly ducked creditors
from his earlier bankruptcy, including an unpaid $1.2-million fraud
judgment that Riddell won in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   In April, a Superior Court jury found that the defendants engaged
in a conspiracy to defraud Riddell, awarding him $1.7 million in
compensatory damages and $16 million in punitive damages. The jury
held Slemons responsible for $2.5 million of the punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, I feel bad about [the result], and in a way I feel
good," Slemons said from Honolulu, where he said he is living on
Social Security payments and a loan from his 94-year-old mother. He
said he was duped by his fellow defendants and will fight to get some
of the money back. "Now, I feel there's some hope in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Riddell's attorney, Gary Dapelo, said he emerged from the trial
sympathetic to Slemons, whom private investigators dogged throughout
California, Hawaii and even Switzerland in the late 1990s trying to
unravel what happened to his remaining assets.</TE>
<TE>   "They played him like a piano," Dapelo said of Friedemann and the
Hornings. "He got into bed with cheats and they cheated him."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Bill O'Hare, who represents the Hornings and Newport
Federal Financial, said his clients got snared in sour business
dealings with Friedemann and Slemons, losing about $1.5 million.
During the trial, the Hornings, whose businesses have real estate and
pawnbrokers' licenses, contended that they took Slemons' properties
through legitimate transactions.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Slemons has arranged to stick my clients with his debt,"
O'Hare said. "My clients are lenders. They loaned money and didn't
get paid back. Believe me, there's been no money made on our end....
We were set up to be the fall guy."</TE>
<TE>   The jury, however, disagreed that the transactions were legal and
assessed $5 million in punitive damages against Newport Federal
Financial, $2.5 million against Chuck Horning and $500,000 against
Chad Horning.</TE>
<TE>   Friedemann, a Long Beach resident who was slapped with $3 million
in punitive damages, said the defendants expect "a very different
outcome" on June 27 when they will ask Judge David A. Thompson to
reject the jury award and grant a new trial on the Riddell lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be a lot more coming out" in court, Friedemann
said, declining to elaborate. "That's when you'll have the full
story."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Genesis in Bankruptcy</TE>
<TE>   The story that unfolded this year in Thompson's courtroom has its
roots in the bankruptcy of Jim Slemons Imports in August 1991. A year
earlier, the luxury lot--near John Wayne Airport--was the nation's
second-largest Mercedes-Benz dealership, with about $80 million in
revenue that year. It and six other dealerships supported Slemons as
he entertained at the Balboa Bay Club, held his annual Kings of the
Court tennis tournament in Newport Beach and built a
9,500-square-foot Mediterranean-style home in Harbor Ridge, where
nearly every room had an ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   Slemons also had taken over Resort Commuter Airlines with a dream
of cashing in on lucrative sportfishing charters to Baja California.
But a plan to take the airline public failed and the planes it leased
couldn't handle the long-distance trips. Slemons lost $14.7 million
in 18 months, defaulting on loans from Tokai Credit Corp., which he
had secured with personal guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   Riddell, an investor in the airline, had co-signed a $700,000 loan
for it. A jury later found that Slemons, in taking over the business,
reneged on repaying that loan. When Slemons declared bankruptcy, he
couldn't dodge the Riddell debt because fraud judgments can't be
discharged.</TE>
<TE>   Riddell, a successful marketing executive who produced the
"Endless Summer II" surf movie, said in an interview that he began
hearing stories in the mid-1990s of Slemons "living large" despite
pleading poverty. A friend of Riddell's spotted Slemons in
Switzerland; Riddell bumped into him at the airport in Las Vegas; he
was spotted on his way to Hawaii and at a Chrysler dealership in Big
Bear.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, he still had money," Riddell said. "My theory was to
let him relax. I wanted him to be successful and think I'd
disappeared.... I think when we started [the trial in January] he
still thought he had a lot of money hidden away. To watch him find
out that it wasn't there anymore was very, very sad. It was sad for
me because I would like to get my hands on it."</TE>
<TE>   Slemons testified that he went to Friedemann in late 1995 because
of the attorney's reputation as an "asset-protection specialist."
Friedemann owned Renta Finance Ltd., a company registered in the
British Virgin Islands. Slemons said he hired Friedemann to represent
him in resolving a $10-million Internal Revenue Service lien and then
signed over everything he had to Friedemann through Renta Finance.</TE>
<TE>   "Gus Friedemann said he'd protect me from creditors, my ex-wives
and [Riddell]," Slemons said. "I wanted to protect my assets until I
could get back on my feet. I didn't realize I had enough to pay off
[Riddell]. I thought I had about $300,000."</TE>
<TE>   He said Friedemann signed everything on his behalf, setting up and
managing a trust account for him, which took in more than $4 million
over the next five years, according to Friedemann's testimony. The
money came primarily from the sale of Slemons' Mercedes dealership, a
court settlement from a separate lawsuit, and cashing in Slemons'
life insurance and retirement accounts and interest.</TE>
<TE>   Slemons said he never got an accounting of the trust fund's assets
and didn't know how much had been collected. If he needed money, he
said, he asked Friedemann.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief interview last week, Friedemann denied that he was
Slemons' attorney and said he was only his business partner. In
personal bankruptcy papers that Friedemann filed shortly before this
year's trial began, he said the trust account had only $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with IRS problems, Riddell's judgment and a nasty divorce
from his sixth wife, Tajah, Slemons finally got a break in 1996. That
year, Tokai Credit began unwinding its business in California and
wanted to get the original $15-million note for the airplane business
off its books. The bank had seized 17 of Slemons' properties; four
remained: houses in Avalon on Santa Catalina Island, at Big Bear
Lake, in Rancho Mirage and a half-interest in an oceanfront condo on
Maui.</TE>
<TE>   Tokai agreed to forgive the loan and return the remaining
property, selling its note to Renta for $5,000, according to trial
testimony. Tokai also turned over to Renta the rights to more than $1
million in lease payments from Fletcher Jones Motor Cars Inc., which
bought Slemons' Mercedes dealership from Tokai in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Slemons, meanwhile, hoped to get back on his feet with a Chrysler
dealership in Big Bear. Friedemann introduced him to the Hornings,
who would put up money for new cars to fill the showroom floor while
Slemons managed the business, Slemons and Friedemann testified.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornings also had their eyes on Slemons' four remaining
properties. In July 1998, Newport Federal Financial paid Friedemann
$10,000 for the Tokai note, which included the four houses, documents
introduced at the trial showed. Under the deal, Slemons and
Friedemann would be able to buy back the homes on Aug. 15, 2002, for
$25,000. Six months after obtaining the note, Newport Federal
foreclosed on the houses, records showed.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day it bought the Tokai note, Newport Federal
Financial lent Friedemann $190,000, secured against Slemons'
properties, at an annual interest rate of 60%. An additional loan of
$100,000 followed two months later, secured by income from Slemons'
Volvo dealership in Honolulu--the only business he had left--and
future proceeds from a lawsuit that Friedemann arranged to be filed
on Slemons' behalf against Honda Motor Corp.</TE>
<TE>   That suit eventually was settled for $2.5 million, $1.25 million
of which went into the trust account controlled by Friedemann. The
other half went to the attorney who had filed the case in Santa Clara
County.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loan Knowledge Denied</TE>
<TE>   Slemons testified later that he didn't know anything about the
loans, which jumped to 120% annual interest upon default last year.
As late as last week, the homes were still being rented--for $4,000
to $6,000 a month--through a Web site called thebestspots.com, which
is owned by a subsidiary of Newport Federal. O'Hare said the homes
have cost more to keep up than what they've earned through rents.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1999, Riddell's attorney, Dapelo, had begun reconstructing
the financial web between Slemons, Friedemann and Newport Federal
Financial. Armed with the 1993 Riddell judgment, he began taking
depositions of the Hornings, Slemons and others. Friedemann
repeatedly refused to be deposed, Dapelo said, but Judge Thompson
ordered him to undergo one in the jury room before the trial started.</TE>
<TE>   Slemons, who sat in on the deposition, said he became physically
ill upon learning of the millions that had flowed through the trust
account, including $1 million in lease payments from Fletcher Jones
and $1.25 million from the Honda settlement. A week before the trial
started, Slemons fired his attorney, a friend of Friedemann's who was
being paid with money lent to Friedemann by the Hornings. He got his
own lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a travesty," said Slemons attorney Joseph DuBois, who is
challenging Friedemann's bankruptcy application. "From where I sit, I
have a client who didn't have to go through that, he didn't have to
lose everything. He didn't have to have people chasing him."</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Slemons friend, Anaheim hotelier Ben Harris, said
Slemons got a "bad rap" over the years because of his many wives and
well-documented social life. He said he has seen no evidence of
recent wealth--Slemons drives a 1989 Chrysler while in Orange County.
He wore the same jacket throughout the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been a complete gentleman and a straight arrow, as
far as I'm concerned," Harris said. "He's just out there trying to
put something together."</TE>
<TE>   Riddell, who became almost an afterthought during this year's
trial, said he is willing to see the case through after spending "six
figures" to pursue his claim. He said Dapelo more than earned his
contingency in the case, which they didn't disclose, and will send
the rest to his ex-wife and his children--a daughter, 16, who lives
in Arizona with her mother and his son, 19, a Mormon missionary in
Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "I chased Slemons for 10 years and I'll chase the Hornings for 10
years," Riddell said. "I'm past the [anger] point. All of this could
have been settled a long time ago, but because of greed, they didn't
want to. It was the arrogance that got me. It kept me going."</TE>

supervisors are warning health and law enforcement officials that
their budgets may be pared further if state cuts are as severe as
expected.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors are considering dipping into tobacco settlement and
public safety funds to make up for a projected $26-million loss of
state revenue. Both proposals are controversial.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Bob Brooks has already vowed to fight any attempt to cut
his $162-million budget.</LD>
<TE>   And a citizens committee that makes recommendations on tobacco
settlement spending has made clear that it doesn't want that money to
be used to close a revenue gap.</TE>
<TE>   Although everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach for now, the
budget skirmishes may grow more heated after the state approves its
fiscal plan. "We're very unsure what the state is going to do,"
Supervisor Kathy Long said. "If there has ever been a budget crisis,
we are in it."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors will begin their own budget hearings at 1 p.m. today
at the Hall of Administration in Ventura. Public comment will begin
at 6 p.m. in the board's chambers.</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston is proposing a
$1.2-billion 2002-03 budget that calls for $17.6 million in
reductions. That figure does not include state losses that could push
the final deficit to nearly $44 million.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston has warned of the coming shortfall for months and
department managers have eliminated 140 vacant positions to help
close that gap.</TE>
<TE>   But county officials fear that even deeper reductions may be on
the way as the state faces its own financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis said a weakened economy and lower tax receipts
have left the state with a $24-billion deficit. In May, he proposed a
combination of tax increases, program reductions and debt
refinancing.</TE>
<TE>   About $1.2 billion would come in cuts to county-operated programs.
Ventura County's loss would total about $26 million, most of it in
reductions to health and social service programs.</TE>
<TE>   If that worst-case scenario comes to pass, supervisors may turn to
tobacco settlement and public safety dollars to make up the
difference. Johnston is recommending supervisors hold off allocating
the tobacco money until the exact state funding is known.</TE>
<TE>   Several supervisors said they support Johnston's recommendation
and that they would not object to using a portion of the $10.3
million to close a deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost we have to maintain our health care safety
net," Supervisor Judy Mikels said. "If we have to stitch it back
together with these tobacco funds, for this year only, that's what we
should do."</TE>
<TE>   David Maron, chairman of the Tobacco Settlement Advisory
Committee, said the panel realizes supervisors may be forced to dip
into the money. "It would be naive not to think that the county will
look at those tobacco funds," he said. "But the [$8 million]
allocated last year is already out in the community delivering an
incredible amount of good value. That fulfills the promise of the
board to help every resident of the county. And that should not be
overlooked."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest fight, however, may come over one supervisor's
proposal to notify public safety managers that their budgets may be
tightened further.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Steve Bennett said four agencies--the sheriff, district
attorney, public defender and probation--received $4.4 million more
from county general funds than they were entitled to this year under
a local ordinance that protects their funding. Bennett said
supervisors should consider reallocating that money if the state cuts
prove onerous. Two other supervisors, Long and John Flynn, said they
support's Bennett's idea.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said he won't sit idly by if his budget is threatened.
Brooks said he has already trimmed $2 million from the coming year's
spending plan, and Bennett's proposal would mean an additional
$1.5-million reduction.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already eliminated 14 patrol and four court positions
because we didn't have money to pay for them," Brooks said. "So any
attempt to go back and recoup that would just mean a devastating
decrease in our services."</TE>

<HD>Parents More Vigilant Over Pools</HD>
<DH>Drowning: The death of a boy at a swim party has prompted
hosts to hire lifeguards, take CPR.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The highly publicized drowning two weeks ago of a 7-year-old boy at a
Holmby Hills swim party while a group of adults stood poolside has
jolted many parents, who are cringing over their sometimes lax
practices at swim parties and are vowing vigilant poolside
supervision this summer.</LD>
<LD>   The drowning of Paolo Ayala, who was found in the pool two days
after he drowned in cloudy waters that obscured the bottom, has also
prompted a noticeable spike in enrollment in CPR courses, swim
lessons and requests for private lifeguard services, according to Red
Cross officials and aquatic center directors.</LD>
<LD>   "When there is an incident such as the Holmby Hills tragedy so
close to summer, it really is a wake-up call to parents," said Lisa
Derderian, spokeswoman for the San Gabriel Valley Red Cross. She
noticed a surge of interest in infant and child CPR classes, which
are booked up for weeks, when normally there are summer vacancies.</LD>
<TE>   "It's end-of-school swim parties, it's Fourth of July, it's a
greater awareness of the need to be prepared since 9/11," Derderian
said. "And then this drowning ... it all starts to hit home."</TE>
<TE>   On the Westside, the Red Cross said visits to its water safety Web
site, www.acrossla.org, have more than doubled--from 700 to more than
1,500 daily--since the discovery of Paolo's body on June 4. Also,
enrollment this month in CPR classes is 30% higher than last year,
which officials attribute to both a public awareness campaign and the
recent drowning.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, Patty Kenmore, director of the Rose Bowl Aquatic
Center, said she has been surprised by the volume of recent calls
from parents seeking to hire lifeguards for their children's parties,
an emerging safety trend at private backyard pool gatherings. She
recalled perhaps five calls the entire summer last year.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last few weeks alone we've already gotten 12 calls for
guards," Kenmore said. "People are definitely reacting to this
tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   The hard-to-believe news of the Holmby Hills drowning was that the
child lay unseen at the bottom of the swimming pool for nearly 48
hours while police mounted an intense neighborhood-wide search.
Paolo, who could not swim, sank underwater without anyone noticing,
although there were about 10 parents and about 20 schoolmates at the
party.</TE>
<TE>   Police and others repeatedly looked in the pool, seeing what
looked like a white bottom. The body was discovered in the deep end
after a pool maintenance man chemically treated the water. The
bottom, it turned out, was not smooth and white as searchers had
thought. It was bluish and battered looking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Party Scene</TE>
<TE>   But it's not so much the unusual condition of that pool that has
chilled parents. It's the familiarity of the family pool party scene
that they can readily envision--chatty adults and splashing, playful
children--prompting a sobering evaluation of where they, too, have
gone wrong and need to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a pool party the very same day that the little boy died,"
said Jeannie Joe, 49, of South Pasadena. She said parents stood
nearby, but no one was assigned the sole task of pool supervision.
She was in and out of the pool area tending to the party. "We all
felt so comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   No more, though. "The next party is going to be more structured,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Joe has enacted strict rules for her next pool gathering this
week. She is placing a director's chair, a sign up sheet and a timer
at the head of the pool. Parents will rotate responsibility for
watching the pool in 15-minute increments. She will ask parents about
their children's swimming capabilities before they enter the pool.
And all parents will be invited to stay to help supervise their
children.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Empathy for Parents</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK to be paranoid," Joe said. "I'm sure the parents who have
lost children to drownings wish they had been more paranoid."</TE>
<TE>   Joe was among several hundred parents who stood in line for hours
Saturday to sign up for swim lessons at South Pasadena High School.
Pool director Steve Reyes, who manages the summer lessons, said he
had a last-minute demand for sign-up information, which he attributed
in part to publicity over the drowning.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Steffann, 51, said he has a renewed resolve to continue to
inspect the pool for clarity and stay with his 7-year-old son during
pool parties, believing that it is his responsibility, not the
hosts', to supervise his child.</TE>
<TE>   "You know parents are going to be talking to each other," he said.
"I absolutely am going to stay through the parties."</TE>
<TE>   One Alhambra mother, who hosted a children's party at her home a
week ago, sensed parents' heightened concern and made an extra effort
to call and explain how her party would be supervised--one adult
"standing sentry" at each end of the pool for the duration of swim
time.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Cisneros hired a lifeguard for an end-of-school swim party
for seventh-graders at her La Canada home Friday. Hillary Degani, a
UC Davis sophomore who works at the Rose Bowl pool in the summer,
supervised the party.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better to get a guard because parents get distracted, they
start talking to each other," said Degani, who counts swimmers,
watches for roughhousing and systematically scans all sections of the
pool. A drowning, she and Red Cross officials said, is rarely
flailing, arm-waving calls for help. Instead, it's a silent slip
beneath the surface, difficult to detect unless the swimmers are
constantly accounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross and YMCA officials said they are not aware of any
central hiring service for lifeguards, but advise pool owners to
contact their local parks and recreation pools and aquatic centers or
a YMCA pool for help. The cost usually runs $20 to $40 an hour.
Guards should be either Red Cross- or YMCA-certified.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, Red Cross officials advise pool party hosts to
specifically assign adults to watch the pool, scan the water in
sections and keep constant track of all swimmers. A portable phone
should be on hand, and one adult should be CPR certified.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Cordova, 25, of Azusa spent all day Saturday at a Red
Cross-sponsored CPR and first aid course. As a teacher, the
certification is required. As a mother, she says it's a must. Every
time she hears of a drowning, she said she flashes back to the moment
several years ago when she witnessed her 2-year-old daughter slip
beneath the water of a hotel pool.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all so quiet when it happened," said Cordova, who said the
incident taught her that "laying out" by the pool while children are
swimming is not good enough. "The key is to constantly watch and know
how to react."</TE>
<TE>   The teachers at Hathaway Family Resource Center, a nonprofit group
that provides literacy, parenting and adult education in Highland
Park, said the Holmby Hills drowning made them decide to cancel a
literacy seminar next week and instead provide a course on water
safety and first aid.</TE>
<TE>   "So many of the children in our community tend to be cared for by
Grandma, aunts or uncles, who may not know how to swim," Cynthia Sun
said. "We felt that this was the most important thing for them to
know right now."</TE>

<HD>A Pretty Shoulder to Drive On</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Decorative asphalt gracing the 101 is considered a
safer substitute for oleanders in the median.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is that terra cotta and blue strip anyway? Drive north on the
Ventura Freeway, cross the Santa Clara River Bridge, and you can't
miss it. Running parallel to the fresh installation of barriers,
mulch and shrubbery lies a narrow rust-colored shoulder interspersed
with blue triangles.</LD>
<LD>   Unveiled two weeks ago, the 1.8-mile-long shoulder of stamped
asphalt is the most noticeable aspect of a 10-mile, $3.8-million
Caltrans project to create a permanent median on the freeway at the
Ventura exits.</LD>
<LD>   The simulated brick was designed to mimic the city's landmark San
Buenaventura Mission, founded in 1782 by Father Junipero Serra. The
blue triangles symbolize the ocean waves that draw so many surfers to
the city.</LD>
<TE>   At a price of $191,400, this purely decorative element has raised
some eyebrows. State officials say it's safer, and in the long run
could be cheaper to maintain, than the full-grown oleanders the city
wanted to use to fill in the median. Those require trimming by crews,
and branches can crack and fly into traffic during a crash. Landscape
architects for the state thought a good compromise was to plant dwarf
oleander bushes and include the decorative strip to add flair.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for a balance of safety and beauty," said
California Department of Transportation project manager Mumbie
Fredson-Cole. "It makes your drive pleasant, and it also gives the
city something they can identify with."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans spokeswoman Ivy Estrada said a new agency policy
encourages design elements that take note of a community's symbols.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura public works officials say they're pleased. "We're excited
about the design," said City Engineer Rick Raives. "We told them
aesthetics are very important to our community."</TE>
<TE>   Locals seem curious about the decorative strip. The most common
question: "What is it?" Beyond that, reaction is mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "For all the work they were doing and all the trouble I've had
getting through, when I saw that brick thing I felt kind of ripped
off," said Kai Dodson, a manager at Salzer's Records in Ventura. "I
just think it's unnecessary."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Albertson, an employee at the French Flower Market across
the highway, is a fan. It's the sort of detail tourists may remember
fondly long after they visit the city, she said. "I was wondering
what it was," she added. "But I definitely thought it was
attractive."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The weather was warm and the waves were low on a sunny day in 1995
when Chris McAleer's life as a surfer came to a jarring end.</LD>
<LD>   He remembers somersaulting off his board and splashing into the
small waves off 48th Street in Newport Beach. His head hit the
ground. He heard something click</LD>
<LD>   "I was face-down in the water and I could move my head, but I
couldn't move my arms to start swimming," McAleer said. "I just
started praying."</LD>
<TE>   The impact of hitting the unseen sandbar had shoved his head into
his shoulder, crushing his spinal cord and breaking several neck
bones.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later he remains in a wheelchair. He has movement in
his arms but can't move anything else below his collarbone. On a
recent morning at the Newport Beach Pier, he did his best to shake a
visitor's hand although his no longer functions.</TE>
<TE>   Now a spokesman for Project Wipeout, an outreach program developed
by Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach to prevent
neck and spinal injuries at the beach, McAleer has become accustomed
to telling his story.</TE>
<TE>   He was 23 and working night jobs in order to spend his days
surfing. June 10, 1995, started off as a typical day: He grabbed his
board and ran to the beach. He felt happy. Carefree.</TE>
<TE>   That changed when he flipped off his board and hit a sandbar.
Unable to move, his body dipped under the waves and floated until
someone rescued him. At the hospital, he was told that he'd be
paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, it took awhile before those words began to sink in,"
McAleer said. "I could still move my arms, so I thought I was going
to be OK eventually.</TE>
<TE>   "My family just rallied around me and told me I had to get
moving," McAleer said. "I realized that I might not be able to hold
hands or walk on the beach, but I can hear, taste, smell and see. You
can either give up and be a hermit or get out and explore life."</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital, McAleer agreed to be interviewed for an
educational video for Project Wipeout. He has worked with the
hospital ever since.</TE>
<TE>   As each summer approaches, McAleer visits schools and warns
students of the ocean's power and danger.</TE>
<TE>   His presence in a classroom is usually enough to catch the
attention of even the most jaded student, he said. "There's kind of a
shock effect because I'm this young guy, in a wheelchair, in their
face," McAleer said. "I was very active, into all these sports and
all it took was one wave."</TE>
<TE>   For more than 20 years, Project Wipeout at Hoag Hospital has
worked with schools. Upon request, Hoag Hospital representatives,
Orange County lifeguards and people such as McAleer visit schools and
speak to its targeted group--teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   According to the National Spinal Cord Assn., there are 200,000
spinal-cord injury cases in the United States every year, and 7% to
8% of those injuries occur during sports-related activities.</TE>
<TE>   At Newport Beach alone, there are about 40 spinal and cervical
injuries every summer, said Kris Okamoto, the director of Project
Wipeout.</TE>
<TE>   McAleer works as an aide at an after-school day-care center in
Tustin, his hometown. Lately he has developed an interest in
remote-control cars, but surfing still holds a special place in his
heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't knock the sport," McAleer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say I almost died enjoying what I love."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Lowe claims he's only a No. 3 starter, but his record suggests
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe outpitched Tom Glavine and became the first American League
pitcher to win 11 games, helping the Boston Red Sox beat the Atlanta
Braves, 6-1, Sunday at Turner Field in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Varitek and Trot Nixon homered for the Red Sox. Pedro
Martinez and John Burkett, Boston's top two starters, lost the first
two games of the series.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not the ace, I'll tell you that right now," Lowe said. "This
is only two months. To be considered an ace, you've got to do this
for years. I'm the third guy in line, and I just try to win games."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago White Sox 10, Chicago Cubs 7--Carlos Lee spoiled the Cubs'
hopes for their first sweep of the season, driving in a career-high
seven runs with a grand slam and a three-run homer to lead the White
Sox at Wrigley Field.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 2, San Francisco 1--Barry Zito pitched into the seventh
inning for his eighth consecutive victory and the Athletics won the
Bay Bridge series, taking two of three at Pacific Bell Park. Zito
(9-2) gave up four hits in 6 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 7, Milwaukee 6--David Ortiz drove in three runs during a
four-run first inning and Dustan Mohr, Denny Hocking and Corey Koskie
hit home runs for the Twins at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Colorado 4--Bartolo Colon won for the fourth time in
five starts for the Indians, who have won four of six overall and six
of nine on the road. The Rockies have lost 10 of 13.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 11, Detroit 2--Mark Grace drove in three runs with a homer
and his 500th double and Rick Helling (7-5) scattered six hits in
eight innings at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Toronto 5--Mike Mordecai's single with one out in the
bottom of the ninth inning drove in Troy O'Leary to give the Expos
their fifth straight win.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Kansas City 1--Woody Williams pitched a five-hitter
and helped himself at the plate with a double and an RBI as the
Cardinals completed a three-game sweep at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, Seattle 3--Oliver Perez, a 20-year-old left-hander,
won his major league debut and was helped by Wiki Gonzalez, who hit a
three-run homer at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Texas 6--Craig Biggio hit a run-scoring single off John
Rocker in the bottom of the ninth inning. Julio Lugo hit two home
runs for the Astros.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, Philadelphia 2--Travis Driskill, a 30-year-old
rookie, won his fourth decision in a row, yielding two runs and five
hits in 6 1/3 innings at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Cincinnati 1--Craig Wilson homered for the third
straight game and Jimmy Anderson pitched a five-hitter at Cincinnati.</TE>

<HD>Goodwin Is Deemed Expendable by Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants designated veteran outfielder Tom Goodwin
for assignment Sunday when they took utility infielder Ramon Martinez
off the 15-day disabled list.</LD>
<LD>   Goodwin signed a minor league deal with the Giants on April 17
after he was waived by the Dodgers during spring training.</LD>
<LD>   He was recalled from triple-A Fresno of the Pacific Coast League
May 7 by the Giants, who have spent all season searching for a
reliable leadoff hitter.</LD>
<TE>   Goodwin, the major league leader in stolen bases since 1995,
batted .242 with five RBIs and five stolen bases in 24 games with the
Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants made the move despite the poor play of fellow veterans
Shawon Dunston, who's hitting only .154, and Marvin Benard (.267). If
Goodwin clears waivers, the Giants said they would welcome him back
at Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez is batting .301 with two homers and 10 RBIs, but he
sustained a concussion this month when he was accidentally hit by a
throw from teammate J.T. Snow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston pitcher John Burkett reiterated that he won't go to the
All-Star game in Milwaukee if he is selected, although he declined to
say it was because of Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my reasons, and I don't want to go into that, but I
thought it out," Burkett said before Sunday's game against the
Atlanta Braves.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he told the Boston Globe he would boycott the game to
protest Selig's handling of labor negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   If Burkett makes the All-Star team, he'll receive a $50,000 bonus
in addition to his $5.5 million salary this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Jim Edmonds of the St. Louis Cardinals was taken
off the 15-day disabled list in time for Sunday's game against the
Kansas City Royals at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds sat out 12 games because of a sprained right wrist
sustained in a slide at home plate on May 31 against the Pittsburgh
Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   He entered the game batting .341 with 12 home runs and 36 RBIs in
51 games. He doubled in three at-bats and scored a run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians put second baseman Ricky Gutierrez, who has
a strained left groin, on the 15-day disabled list. He was injured
while scoring the winning run from first base in Cleveland's 2-1,
10-inning win over Baltimore on Thursday.... The Colorado Rockies put
second baseman Jose Ortiz on the 15-day disabled list because of a
strained left hamstring. Ortiz was injured in the first inning of
Colorado's 7-5 loss to Boston Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Tyson's Objectors Lost in Numbers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After a bloody chunk of Evander Holyfield's right ear landed on the
canvas of the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in his 1997
heavyweight title match against Mike Tyson, the howls of outrage were
deafening.</LD>
<LD>   Tyson should never be allowed to fight again, they said.</LD>
<LD>   After Francois Botha had an arm nearly broken by Tyson in a 1999
fight, the anger was fierce.</LD>
<TE>   We'll never pay for another Tyson fight, they said.</TE>
<TE>   After Tyson bit Lennox Lewis on the upper thigh at a New York news
conference in January, the disgust was universal.</TE>
<TE>   Don't give this man a boxing license, they said.</TE>
<TE>   After Tyson gave a series of profane interviews, the beeped-out,
four-letter words leaving little in the way of sound bites, the
revulsion was unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   Take this man off the tube, they said.</TE>
<TE>   So who are they, this chorus who seemed to speak with a single
voice, totally rejecting Tyson and all that he stood for.</TE>
<TE>   Either they were a loud vocal minority or they are hypocrites.</TE>
<TE>   Because when Tyson stepped into the ring last Saturday night to
face Lewis in a heavyweight title fight at the Pyramid in Memphis,
all the protests, the denial of a license for Tyson in Nevada, the
lack of interest in the fight shown by California, New York and other
states, the groups that wanted Tyson banned from boxing seemed to be
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   The only clamor was for the number of the local pay-per-view
outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Although it cost a record $54.95 to order the fight, 1.8 million
did so in the United States alone, the second-largest number of
pay-per-view buys for a fight.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people watching was estimated at 10 million. That
represents an average of five people per buy and about a million
additional viewers watching on closed circuit in theaters. Add to
that number the many homes that used illegal black boxes, which allow
viewers to steal the signal. International figures are not yet
available.</TE>
<TE>   Suffice it to say, millions watched a fight that so many claimed
they wouldn't lower themselves to even glance at, and paid millions
to do so. The fight grossed a record $103 million domestically.</TE>
<TE>   Blood and violence sells. That's hardly a news bulletin.</TE>
<TE>   That Tyson sells is also not a bulletin. The best-selling fight of
all time was the ear-biting match, which attracted 1.99 million
pay-per-view buys.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson has been in the top four pay-per-view matches. The first
Tyson-Holyfield fight, held in 1996, drew 1.59 million buys. Tyson's
comeback fight after three years in prison on a rape conviction, his
match against Peter McNeeley in 1995, attracted 1.55 million buys.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Tyson has been in six of the top 10 pay-per-view fights.</TE>
<TE>   It will be interesting to see if the public is similarly attracted
to the kindler, gentler Tyson. He seemed out of character Saturday
night after being totally dominated and ultimately knocked out in the
eighth round by Lewis. Tyson was gracious in defeat. He praised
Lewis, even wiped a spot of blood off the champion's face. Tyson also
kissed Lewis' mother, Violet.</TE>
<TE>   This is what people claimed they always wanted from Tyson, for him
to act like a decent human being. The question, if he maintains this
new image: Will he still be as popular in the pay-per-view market?</TE>
<TE>   Is a two-time heavyweight champion who is trying to regain his
peak form while staying within the rules of the sport and the rules
of decency as attractive to fight fans as the raving maniac whose
announced goal was to kill his opponents and eat their children?</TE>
<TE>   Or, will it turn out that, for the all the protests, all people
wanted after all was the blood, the bites and the possibility of a
severed body part?</TE>
<TE>   What Next?</TE>
<TE>   Although neither man is ready to commit publicly, it seems likely
both will again fight, though not against each other.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis-Tyson turned out to be a lot like the Lewis-David Tua fight,
a tall heavyweight champion with a long reach and a vicious jab
holding off and beating up a smaller man. Nobody wants to see that
again.</TE>
<TE>   At 36, Lewis finally has what he has been seeking his whole
career, the respect of the boxing world. And why not, since he is
fighting better than ever?</TE>
<TE>   There is a new generation out there for him to face, from Chris
Byrd to Kirk Johnson. Most likely, Lewis' next opponent will be
Wladimir Klitschko of Ukraine. Even though his brother, Vitali, is
rated higher, Wladimir, who fights Ray Mercer in Atlantic City on
June 29 and faced Lewis in a fictional fight in the movie "Ocean's
Eleven," is considered the more marketable opponent should he prevail
against Mercer.</TE>
<TE>   As for Tyson, his most lucrative match would be a third fight
against Holyfield.</TE>
<TE>   And it could even happen in Las Vegas. Marc Ratner, executive
director of the Nevada commission, doesn't rule out a more favorable
response for Tyson if he again seeks a license</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important the way he handled himself [last Saturday],"
Ratner said.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly plays in his favor if he decides to apply And I
think the way the fight went helped boxing in its own peculiar way."</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jabs</TE>
<TE>   World Boxing Council featherweight champion Erik Morales, who will
face Marco Antonio Barrera on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena,
will hold a public workout today at the Wild Card Boxing Club, 1123
Vine St., beginning at 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden State Boxer's Assn. will present its Lifetime
Achievement Award to former heavyweight champions Ken Norton and Mike
Weaver, trainer Bill Slayton, the promotional team of Sugar Ray
Leonard and Bijorn Rebney, promoters Don Chargin and Don Fraser, and
boxing writers John Hall and Doug Krikorian Saturday, June 22 at the
Old Spaghetti Factory in Hollywood. To attend, call 818-764-2903.</TE>

<TE>*--*
Monday, 11:30 p.m. PDT, at Miyagi, Japan
TV: ESPN, Ch. 34. Delayed: ESPN2, 9 a.m.; Ch. 46, noon; ESPN Classic,
Wednesday, 10 a.m
How they got here: Japan finished first in Group H with a 2-0-1
record, its first two World Cup victories after debuting at 0-3 in
1998. Turkey, in its first World Cup appearance since 1954, finished
second behind Brazil in Group C at 1-1-1
Japan update: No Asian team has ever beaten a European opponent
during the knockout stage of a World Cup, but Japan, with momentum
and the home-fan advantage, is expected to become the first. Japan
and Turkey have met only once previously, in the 1997 Kirin Cup, and
Japan won, 1-0. Including pre-Cup exhibition matches, Japan is 5-1-4
in 2002, the only defeat coming against Norway in May
Turkey update: The Turks have attrition problems. Emre Asik and Emre
Belozoglu will sit out against Japan because of suspensions.
Goalkeeper Rusto Recber, perhaps Turkey's most valuable player, is
recovering from a thigh strain that forced him out of the 3-0 victory
over China in the 35th minute. Midfielder Hasan Sas and striker Hakan
Suker have been hampered by leg injuries, but are expected to play
Sidelined: Turkey: Asik (suspended), Belozoglu (suspended)
Outlook: "Our aim," Turkey Coach Senol Gunes says, "is to get the
result with the kind of football that the Japanese supporters can
applaud." Unfortunately for Gunes, the Japanese supporters are saving
their applause for a victory by the home team. It won't be long now</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even a team that has been to the College World Series 10 times can
find uncharted territory in Omaha.</LD>
<LD>   Clemson (54-15) improved to 2-0 for the first time in the CWS
after the Tigers scored eight runs in the second inning and held off
Atlantic Coast Conference rival Georgia Tech, 9-7, Sunday before a
crowd of 25,581 at Rosenblatt Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just pleased with where we're at right now, but there's a
bigger goal in mind," Coach Jack Leggett said after the Tigers moved
within one win of the championship game. "You've got to stay on edge
if you want to win this tournament."</LD>
<TE>   Clemson, 3-2 against Georgia Tech this season, will play Wednesday
against either the Yellow Jackets or South Carolina, who will play an
elimination game Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an easy task, it just puts us in a better position than
maybe they're in," Leggett said.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil Greene went hitless in four at-bats, ending his 35-game
hitting streak, but it didn't matter with the way the rest of the
Tigers were hitting. Michael Johnson was three for three with a homer
and two RBIs and Jeff Baker hit a bases-loaded double during the
Tigers' big second inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody seemed to get the hits when we needed them," Johnson
said. "In that eight-run inning, everybody contributed."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Perry homered and had two RBIs and Philip Perry had a strong
relief outing that gave the Yellow Jackets (52-15) a chance at coming
back.</TE>
<TE>   "We just couldn't get them out. They had some great at-bats and
ended up putting a big number up there," Georgia Tech Coach Danny
Hall said. "But to my guys' credit, we battled back."</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina 10, Nebraska 8--Yaron Peters hit a tiebreaking,
two-run homer in the ninth inning and the Gamecocks eliminated the
Cornhuskers.</TE>
<TE>   "All day long I didn't get much to hit. I didn't get a chance to
get extended on anything," said Peters, who drove a two-strike pitch
from Jeremy Becker over the wall in right-center.</TE>
<TE>   "My eyes just blew up when I saw something over the middle of the
plate. If I was going to go, I was going to go hacking."</TE>
<TE>   The Gamecocks (54-17) rallied from a 4-0 deficit for their first
CWS win in three appearances. South Carolina, which had only six hits
while being shut out by Georgia Tech, 11-0, in the opening round, had
15 hits off six Nebraska pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly wanted to come out and have a character performance
today, and we certainly did. Being down 4-0, it didn't look too
good," South Carolina Coach Ray Tanner said. "Today it was a
heavyweight fight and we were fortunate to come out on top."</TE>
<TE>   John Wesley (2-0) got the win when Brandon Eymann flew out to deep
right. Wesley, South Carolina's fifth pitcher, pitched 3 2/3 innings
and held the Cornhuskers to one run and two hits.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska (47-21) went 0-2 in the CWS for the second straight year
despite scoring 18 runs in two games.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers left nine runners on base.</TE>

<LD>A referee's report regarding the ejection of Portugal's Joao Pinto
against South Korea on Friday was submitted, but FIFA officials would
not say if it included charges he punched the referee.</LD>
<LD>   Argentine referee Angel Sanchez on Saturday told a radio station
at Del Plata, Argentina, that Pinto punched him after the player was
shown a red card in the 27th minute for a tackle from behind.</LD>
<LD>   South Korea won, 1-0, at Incheon, South Korea. Portugal was
eliminated.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the first time that a player has attacked me," Sanchez
said.</TE>

<KH>DODGER-ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Evans and Tracy Still Have Faith in Beltre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin and Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the hitting and fielding woes of Adrian Beltre, Dodger
General Manager Dan Evans said Sunday that the team is not
contemplating the acquisition of another third baseman.</LD>
<LD>   "Adrian is going to be our third baseman," Evans said. "He's going
through a tough period. This is where your manager and coaching staff
really benefit you. They can get a young player through tough times.
He's still learning at the major league level. He'll be all right."</LD>
<LD>   Beltre, 23, in his fourth full season, leads National League third
basemen with 11 errors. He hit .290 two years ago, with 20 home runs
and 80 strikeouts. He is hitting .244 this season, on pace for 14
homers and 95 strikeouts. Manager Jim Tracy dropped Beltre to the
eighth spot in the lineup Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "He'll work through it," Tracy said. "We've all been in ruts where
we've had to dig ourselves out no matter what walk of life or our job
description entails.</TE>
<TE>   "When any one of us has a bad day or a series of days that hasn't
been so good, you're hopeful you're working for somebody that
understands that as long as we continue to see 100% effort, you're
going to get every opportunity to get it all figured out. We need
this guy. He's a very talented young man."</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Phillies are trying to trade disgruntled third
baseman Scott Rolen, who has an $8.6-million contract this season and
has all but vowed to leave as a free agent this fall. The Dodgers
have not discussed trading for Rolen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman interested in buying the
Angels, visited Southern California last week to meet with Anaheim
Sports President Paul Pressler and other Disney executives, sources
said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings included discussion of how a potential player strike
might affect the value of the franchise. Watkins is expected to meet
with his advisors this week to discuss how to structure a purchase
offer and is considering the subsequent submission of two bids for
the Angels, a lower one in the event of a strike and a higher one if
a strike is averted. In March, Watkins submitted a preliminary offer
of $250 million for the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels reported to spring training, Manager Mike Scioscia
had a set lineup, featuring Tim Salmon hitting third. When Salmon
stumbled so badly at the start of the season, bottoming out at .135
on April 19, Scioscia dropped him in the batting order and used
several hitters in the No. 3 spot. He eventually settled on Troy
Glaus, who has batted third in every game since May 9.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon had two more hits Sunday. He is hitting .345 since May 1
and .285 overall. Glaus went hitless Sunday, striking out twice. He
is hitting .224 since May 1 and .249 overall.</TE>
<TE>   But, as long as the Angels are winning and Glaus is producing
runs--he leads the team in runs scored and runs batted in--Scioscia
is hesitant to mess with success.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked about moving Salmon back up, but right now the
lineup works the way it is," Scioscia said. "If Troy continues to
struggle, we'll consider other things, but I don't think his
struggles have affected our club very much offensively."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The three-game series drew 156,070, the most for a three-game
series at Dodger Stadium since the Cincinnati Reds played here in the
series that opened the home schedule two years ago.... Eric Karros
homered, doubled and singled off Jarrod Washburn, lifting his
lifetime average against the Angel ace to .583 (seven for 12). Said
Washburn: "I'm sure Karros wakes up with a smile on the day I'm
pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts, who doubled as a pinch-hitter and scored the winning
run, is four for four as a pinch-hitter.... Tracy said Omar Daal
would start Saturday against the Boston Red Sox. After he complained
of biceps tendinitis after his last start, the Dodgers skipped him
this time through the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Triple-A Salt Lake pitcher John Lackey, whom the Angels are
considering for a spot start in a June 24 doubleheader at Texas,
pitched a four-hit shutout Saturday in a 1-0 victory over Tucson.
Lackey won his seventh consecutive decision and lowered his
earned-run average to 2.70.</TE>

<HD>Salmon, Karros Strike Back</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angel outfielder, Dodger first baseman rebound
from poor seasons to become productive again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Salmon's two-run home run Sunday made him the Angels' all-time
leader in runs batted in. Eric Karros' two-run shot into the
left-center-field seats led the Dodgers' comeback from a three-run
deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a couple of guys considered by some to be sliding
face-first into the twilight of their careers after atrocious seasons
in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon batted a career-low .227 with 17 homers. Karros hit a
career-low .235 with 15 home runs after tearing a muscle in his back
during spring training.</LD>
<TE>   Both players excelled Sunday as Karros' Dodgers rallied to defeat
Salmon's Angels, 5-4, at Dodger Stadium. And judging by their play so
far this season, they may be returning to top form.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon went two for four to raise his average to .285, which is
especially impressive considering he was hitting .135 on April 19.
His homer in the fourth inning, which put the Angels up, 2-0, allowed
him to pass Brian Downing as the club's all-time RBI leader with 848.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really think about those things," said Salmon, 33, also
the club's home run leader with 259. "It's great that I'm mentioned
in the same sentence with Brian Downing. But I'm still playing. I'm
in the middle of a career.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't think about those things now. Down the road it will
mean something."</TE>
<TE>   Karros went three for four, finishing a triple short of the cycle,
and is batting .312 with seven home runs and 35 RBIs. His homer in
the sixth inning pulled the Dodgers to within a run, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to relocating his hitting stroke, Karros is playing
defense better than he has in at least three seasons, Manager Jim
Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just having a tremendous season," Tracy said. "I can't say
enough good things about this guy. The consummate professional. Has
done nothing but give us great at-bats in big situations, and the
ball doesn't have to be hit out of the ballpark to be a great
at-bat."</TE>
<TE>   Karros, 34, said he "doesn't feel good or bad" about his big game
Sunday--and doesn't care what critics thought about last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I went through last year physically, and what other
people think, I really don't concern myself with," he said.
"Physically, I'm healthy. That's the big difference."</TE>
<TE>   Karros played hurt all season except for a three-week stretch on
the disabled list. The former National League rookie of the year
produced numbers well below those he had established during his first
nine seasons, when he hit .270 and averaged 27 homers and 93 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   But he has made a nice recovery after extensive winter workouts
with physical therapist Alex McKechnie.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon didn't have a doctor's note to explain his horrid 2001
season, in which he drove in 49 runs, another career low. It was just
an aberration, he hoped.</TE>
<TE>   And that appears to be the case. He has 12 home runs and 42 RBIs
this season--though he was quick to shrug off the team RBI record.</TE>
<TE>   "That says more about the longevity I've had with the
organization," said Salmon, who debuted with the Angels in 1992.
"You'll have those statistics when you play long enough like myself,
Brian Downing and Troy Glaus, if he stays with this team long
enough."</TE>

career Sunday, shooting a five-under 67 for a three-stroke victory in
the BellSouth Senior Classic at Nashville. It was his second victory

fifth.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, it's been a great golf course for me," Morgan said.</LD>
<LD>   The 55-year-old Morgan, a seven-time winner on the PGA Tour, moved
into seventh place on the Senior PGA Tour victory list with his first
win since the Instinet Classic a year ago.</LD>

<HD>Oberwald's Win Looks Familiar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a warm Father's Day afternoon at Hollywood Park, Oberwald followed
in his daddy's footsteps.</LD>
<LD>   Six years after his sire, Swiss Yodeler, won the Haggin Stakes,
Oberwald did likewise Sunday for the same owner and trainer
combination of Heinz Steinmann and Mike Harrington.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-1 second choice, who raced coupled with last-place finisher
Luzern, started to edge clear after three furlongs and went on to win
by 1 1/2 lengths over 14-1 shot Royal Place.</LD>
<TE>   The win was the second in three starts for Oberwald, a
California-bred out of the Cahill Road mare Magic Rhythm. He
completed the 5 1/2 furlongs in 1:05 under jockey Victor Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   Bred by Marvin Malmuth, the colt will try to imitate his sire
again when he returns in the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile Championship
on July 20. Swiss Yodeler won that race in 1996 and later that year
stretched out to 1 1/16 miles and won the Hollywood Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never seen this horse before today," Espinoza said. "But
when I saw him in the paddock, he looked nice and calm. He looked
better than any other horse in the race."</TE>
<TE>   The obvious disappointment in the Haggin was 3-10 favorite Crowned
Dancer. He finished third three weeks after his powerful victory in
the Willard Proctor Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why, but he was just very flat today," said Alex
Solis, who stayed with Crowned Dancer after riding Oberwald in his
first two starts. "He was not himself. I had to ride him the whole
way just to hold my position. He was just a different horse today."</TE>
<TE>   Royal Place, who had finished eight lengths behind Crowned Dancer
in the Proctor, was second despite encountering trouble entering the
stretch. He finished 1 1/2 lengths in front of the favorite.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, the best female main-track runner in the country, will
carry the highest weight of her short career in the $250,000 Vanity
Handicap on Saturday at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson and trained by Laura
De Seroux, the 4-year-old Jade Hunter filly was assigned 125 pounds
for the Vanity, a Grade I at 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   If Azeri wins for the seventh time in her eighth start, it would
give her four consecutive Grade I victories and a stranglehold on the
division championship. She is picking up three pounds off her 3
1/2-length win in the Milady Breeders' Cup Handicap over this track
May 25.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Azeri, who began her career with a six-length win at
17-1 on Nov. 1 at Santa Anita, had won the Santa Margarita in Arcadia
and the Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   A winner in both of her races at Hollywood Park, Azeri won't have
many opponents. The only other probables are Affluent, Ask Me No
Secrets, Collect Call, Terna, and, possibly, Starrer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Came Home, who could be the last mount in jockey Chris McCarron's
brilliant career, was given top weight of 124 pounds for Sunday's
$100,000 Affirmed Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron, who announced his retirement over the weekend, said
Sunday will be the last day he'll ride, and he will take his regular
place aboard Came Home.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old Gone West colt will be making his first start since
he finished sixth, beaten 10 1/4 lengths, by War Emblem in the
Kentucky Derby on May 4.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect in the first two starts of his life at Hollywood Park as a
2-year-old, Came Home will appreciate the shorter distance (1 1/16
miles) of the Affirmed. The Grade III race is a prep for the $500,000
Swaps Stakes on July 14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Flying Dash, who won the Hawthorne Derby on May 11, has been
disqualified and the purse money will be redistributed after the
3-year-old tested positive for two drugs (clenbuterol and promazine)
that, in Illinois, are not permitted in a horse's system at any level
on race day.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Drysdale, Flying Dash's trainer, was given a 45-day
suspension and a $2,500 fine. The penalties have been stayed, pending
appeal.</TE>

<TE>*--*
Tuesday, 4:30 a.m. PDT, at Miyagi, Japan
TV: ESPN, Ch. 34. Delayed: ESPN2, 11 a.m.; Ch. 46, 2:30 p.m.; ESPN
Classic, Wednesday, noon
How they got here: South Korea finished 2-0-1 to win Group D. Italy
advanced as the runner-up in Group G
South Korea update: After maintaining the World Cup standard of every
host nation having gone on to the second round, the South Koreans now
want more. "All the players and the coach are not satisfied just by
reaching the last 16," defender Kim Nam-Il said. "Our players have
enormous potential."
Italy update: Italy's defense, by reputation the strongest in the
world, has struggled with injuries and occasional shaky play. But the
Italians can point to four goals called back during group play,
several of them on debatable calls, as the difference between
appearing as one of the tournament's best teams and one that just
managed to gain the second round. Striker Christian Vieri said South
Korea is perhaps the toughest team Italy could play in the second
round. "They're very fast, they run all the match and make a lot of
chances for goals," he said. "We have to go into the game relaxed."
Sidelined: Italy's Fabio Cannavaro (two yellow cards)
Outlook: This is one of the most intriguing of the second-round
matches, posing the question of whether an enthusiastic home crowd
can give the overachieving South Koreans an edge over a traditional
power like Italy. But this is familiar territory for the Italians,
who often start slowly and finish in the finals</TE>

<HD>Castillo Extends Streak to 31</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He singles to become the 27th player to
accomplish feat, but Marlins lose to Tampa Bay, 4-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Another hit for Luis Castillo and another misfire by the Florida
Marlins.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo extended his hitting streak to 31 games but the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays scored four runs in the final two innings Sunday to beat
the Marlins, 4-1.</LD>
<LD>   The Marlins fell back to .500 and missed a chance to gain ground
on NL East leader Atlanta. Florida lost a series at home to its
intrastate rival for the first time, scoring only seven runs in 32
innings.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a bad stretch right now," slumping Marlin slugger Cliff
Floyd said. "We have one bright spot."</TE>
<TE>   That would be Castillo, who singled leading off the first inning
to tie for the fifth-longest streak in the National League since
1900.</TE>
<TE>   It's the 27th time a player has hit in 31 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   The feat has been accomplished only eight times in the major
leagues since 1949, most recently by Vladimir Guerrero of Montreal,
who had a 31-game streak in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to keep going," Castillo said. "But it's more important
for me to win the game."</TE>
<TE>   That didn't happen because Florida's bullpen failed to hold a 1-0
lead. The Devil Rays went 17 2/3 innings without a run until Steve
Cox lined a run-scoring single with two out in the eighth against
Armando Almanza (2-1) to tie the score at 1-1. Ben Grieve followed
with a run-scoring double.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the way I expected to win at the beginning of the year,"
Manager Hal McRae said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I didn't think it would be this gut-wrenching to get a guy
in."</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins, who lost two of three to the Devil Rays, haven't been
more than a game above .500 since May 19.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo pulled a 1-and-1 pitch through the hole between third and
shortstop off Wilson Alvarez in the first, improving his average
against left-handers during the streak to .486 (18 for 37).</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to throw a strike against him," Alvarez said. "He's
right on top of the plate. He swings at everything. He doesn't take
pitches. Plus he can run."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay won a series for the first time since May 21-23 at
Seattle, but Grieve said he didn't see it as a confidence boost.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still 21 games under .500," he said. "I don't think one win
is going to change anything."</TE>

<HD>Vaughn Makes His Presence Felt</HD>
<DH>Interleague: Struggling first baseman hits a three-run
homer to give the Mets 3-2 victory in rubber game of series against
the Yankees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mo Vaughn made up for a season's worth of struggles with one dramatic
swing.</LD>
<LD>   Vaughn hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning to give him
1,001 RBIs and lift the New York Mets to a 3-2 victory over the
Yankees on Sunday night in front of 55,141 at Shea Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the way I envisioned things," Vaughn said. "It hasn't
happened very much, but this whole team has been very positive with
me."</LD>
<TE>   The Mets took two of three from their crosstown rivals, only the
second time they've won a series against the Yankees in nine tries
since interleague play began in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't include the 2000 World Series, won by the Yankees in
five games.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Alomar led off the eighth with a looping double that fell
in front of diving left fielder Rondell White. First baseman Jason
Giambi then booted Mike Piazza's grounder for an error to put runners
at the corners.</TE>
<TE>   Acquired from the Angels for pitcher Kevin Appier last December,
Vaughn stepped to the plate with only four home runs and 21 RBIs this
season.</TE>
<TE>   He has been booed relentlessly by Met fans lately, but he sent
them into a frenzy by driving an 0-1 pitch from David Wells (7-4)
into the right-field bullpen for a 3-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   With the fans cheering and waiting for Vaughn to come out of the
dugout for a curtain call, Timo Perez emerged for a moment with a
smile instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a pretty confident person, but when you do something on this
type of stage, it puts a smile on your face," Vaughn said.</TE>
<TE>   He's batting .455 (30 for 66) lifetime with nine home runs against
Wells--the most for any active hitter against any active pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the one guy in their lineup I know can really burn me.
He's probably the best player I've ever seen in my career because he
owns [me]," Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't fear him. I'm going to go after him and challenge him
until I get his number, because he's certainly got mine."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Guthrie (1-0) got out of a jam in the eighth, striking out
Bernie Williams with two on and getting Robin Ventura to ground into
an inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can keep this intensity up for the rest of the
year," Guthrie said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what the Yankees do every night for years, that's what the
Braves do every night for years. It's what makes the champions every
year, and we've got a taste of it now."</TE>
<TE>   Armando Benitez, who blew a ninth-inning lead Friday night,
pitched a perfect ninth for his 15th save in 17 chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees got RBI singles from Alfonso Soriano and Williams to
take a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Wells yielded three runs--two earned--and eight hits in seven-plus
innings. He struck out seven.</TE>
<TE>   Making his first career start against the Yankees, Pedro Astacio
gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings. He walked three and
struck out six.</TE>

<KH>U.S. OPEN NOTES</KH>
<HD>Warrick Enjoys His Daly Dose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hey, kid, you want to get out of this U.S. Open in a hurry?</LD>
<LD>   Follow me.</LD>
<LD>   We're guessing that's what John Daly said to amateur Kevin Warrick
in Sunday's final round. Going off as the first pairing, Daly and
Warrick completed their round in three hours.</LD>
<TE>   With Daly setting the pace, Warrick had no choice but to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   Had Warrick ever played a faster round?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe by myself on nine holes," Warrick joked. "It was pretty
quick out there. I think I held him up a few times. It was a lot of
fun out there. We kept moving and we both played halfway decent."</TE>
<TE>   In their round of speed golf, Daly shot three-over 73 while
Warrick followed with 74.</TE>
<TE>   Daly and Warrick made for quite a pair.</TE>
<TE>   Daly, playing in his 12th U.S. Open, is a chain-smoking,
overweight, hard-living, long-driving tour veteran who has won two
major titles--the PGA Championship and British Open.</TE>
<TE>   Warrick, 22, is 6 feet 2 and says he weighs 149 pounds. He was one
of five amateurs in the 156-player field.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in their round, a fan yelled that Daly needed to
teach Warrick how to eat.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely need to get a little bigger," Warrick said later.</TE>
<TE>   Daly didn't stick around long enough to make conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wore out," he said as he left the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Well, at least it was an experience Warrick won't soon forget.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awesome," Warrick said of playing with Daly. "He hits it a
mile. I had no clue how far he hit it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So what's so tough about Bethpage Black?</TE>
<TE>   Two more players scored holes in one Sunday, bringing the total to
three for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Miller, son of NBC commentator Johnny Miller, aced the
205-yard, par-three third hole with a five-iron.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Scott Hoch, with a three-iron, made a
hole-in-one at the 17th.</TE>
<TE>   Hoch's ace went over well with the local crowd, as he wore a red,
white and blue shirt adorned with the outline of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Japan's Shigeki Maruyama made a hole in one on the 14th
hole.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outside of Tiger Woods, the most impressive performance at
Bethpage may have been turned in by 44-year-old Nick Faldo, who
finished fifth after shooting three-over 73 on Sunday for a 72-hole
total of 285.</TE>
<TE>   It was Faldo's best finish at the U.S. Open since tying for fourth
place in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Faldo, winner of three Masters championships and three British
Opens, hasn't won the U.S. Open, although he finished second in 1988
to Curtis Strange.</TE>
<TE>   Faldo played this year only after receiving a special exemption
from the USGA.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, this is great," Faldo said of his finish. "This gets me
an exemption. But to finish top 10, I didn't think I could do that at
the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Faldo also offered a few words about Woods.</TE>
<TE>   He thought Woods separated himself by the way he played Friday,
when he shot two-under 68 in a steady rain.</TE>
<TE>   "I think round two was phenomenal," Faldo said. "He could have
quite easily shot a 74, and it would have been a good day in that
weather.</TE>
<TE>   "But he put his head down and he played such a good round, and he
didn't want to give anything away to anybody, just in case the
weather changed in the afternoon. I think that was the key bit to the
week, obviously."</TE>

<HD>NBC, USGA Nearly Come Up All Wet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>If Tiger Woods wasn't going to be the big news at the U.S. Open on
Sunday, then the chance that NBC wouldn't be able to show the finish
probably gave him a good run for the headlines.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, NBC and the United States Golf Assn. barely avoided a
messy incident in the midst of Woods' victory--it might not have been
completed because of a late starting time dictated by NBC. Coupled
with a small time margin for error, a rainstorm stopped play for 49
minutes and jeopardized the chances for the tournament to be
completed Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Woods and Sergio Garcia, the final twosome of the day, didn't tee
off until 3:30 p.m. EDT, with both the United States Golf Assn. and
NBC figuring that would mean a 7:40 p.m. ending.</LD>
<TE>   However, neither party took into account a volatile thunderstorm
that caused play to be halted at 6:03 p.m. with Woods through 11
holes.</TE>
<TE>   Severe weather had been established in the forecast and that might
have prompted an earlier start Sunday to ensure play would be
uninterrupted without incident.</TE>
<TE>   There is precedent for such an action.</TE>
<TE>   At the Masters two months ago, Sunday's play began an hour earlier
than scheduled to make sure the tournament would be completed because
bad weather was expected.</TE>
<TE>   Starting early was not considered by the USGA. According to
spokesman Marty Parkes, there was a discussion about sending the
leaders to the first tee even later, at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The usual starting time for the final pairing at a U.S. Open is 2
p.m. Parkes said the 3:30 p.m. start time was a late decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Our decision is based on conversations we had with NBC," said
Parkes, who was asked who had the final say on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Said Parkes: "I guess I would say we do."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcast partner NBC, which pays the USGA a reported $22 million
to carry the USGA's championship events, benefits if the U.S. Open
telecast crosses into prime time on the East Coast, because it is
expected to draw higher ratings.</TE>
<TE>   However, Parkes said he knew of no USGA decision about the U.S.
Open and its broadcast times decided because of money.</TE>
<TE>   Play resumed just after 7 p.m. and finished in the gathering
twilight at about 8:25 p.m., when Woods closed out his three-shot
victory over Phil Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   If darkness had suspended play, the plan was to finish the
remaining holes this morning, and, if a playoff were necessary, to
begin it soon after.</TE>

<HD>Goalkeeper Trumps Irish Luck</HD>
<DH>Round of 16: Spain wins shootout, 3-2, as Casillas stops
two Ireland shots after teams tie, 1-1, in regulation and overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUWON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Ireland's World Cup fate was written in blood on the floor of a hotel
bathroom in Jerez, Spain, four weeks before the tournament began.</LD>
<LD>   All it took was a clumsy goalkeeper and a broken bottle of
aftershave lotion.</LD>
<LD>   It was exactly one month ago that Santiago Canizares accidentally
dropped a bottle of cologne in his hotel room, then recoiled in
horror as a shard of glass severed a tendon in his right foot.</LD>
<TE>   The freak accident not only knocked Spain's starting goalkeeper
out of Korea/Japan '02, but resulted in Iker Casillas taking over in
the nets and thus spelled doom for the Irish.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, Casillas came up with two huge saves during the
penalty kick shootout as Spain ruined Ireland's hopes of reaching the
quarterfinals. The teams had played to a 1-1 tie after 90 minutes of
regulation and 30 minutes of sudden-death overtime when the game went
to penalties.</TE>
<TE>   After midfielder Matt Holland had blasted his attempt onto and
over the crossbar, Casillas turned back shots by forwards David
Connolly and Kevin Kilbane and Spain prevailed, 3-2, in the shootout
in front of 38,926 at Suwon World Cup Stadium. Spain will play Italy
or South Korea in the quarterfinals Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of luck," the 21-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper
said. "We know we didn't rise to the occasion, but we had luck with
the penalties and in the end we are fortunate to go forward, which is
a result that we deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Spain had the better of the play for much of the match,
but all it had to show for its effort was an eighth-minute headed
goal by Fernando Morientes, his 17th in 23 games for Spain. The
Spanish might have scored more, but their strikers were constantly
snared in the Irish offside trap.</TE>
<TE>   In the final minute, referee Anders Frisk of Sweden spotted
defender Fernando Hierro almost ripping the shirt off striker Niall
Quinn to prevent him from getting to a cross. Robbie Keane scored
from the resulting penalty kick to send the thousands of
green-clad--and often outrageously costumed--Irish fans in the
stadium into a frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   At 1-1, their dream was alive.</TE>
<TE>   Neither team could manage another goal in overtime, although
Damien Duff came close with a raking shot for Ireland that slipped
just wide of the right post, and the game went to the shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland scored on its first and fifth attempts, by Keane and Steve
Finnan, respectively, but Holland's miss and Casillas' saves against
Connolly and Kilbane ended Irish World Cup hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Spain did not do a lot better from the 12-yard spot. Hierro and
Baraja scored, but Juanfran missed wide right and Juan Carlos Valeron
missed wide left before Gaizka Mendieta lashed his penalty kick past
Shay Given to knock Ireland out.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not deserve it in the end," said Ireland Coach Mick
McCarthy. "We deserved to win in normal time, though, and it's
sickening. We're going out of the tournament unbeaten.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had got through this, who knows? We could have been a
potential [World Cup] winner. It shows you what we're all about."</TE>
<TE>   Spain Coach Jose Antonio Camacho was in a bitter mood after the
game, blaming referee Frisk for his team's troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "We had three or four [scoring] opportunities," he said, "and the
referee blew for offside. I'm not sure they were offside and I don't
think the final penalty was a penalty."</TE>
<TE>   Ireland should have tied it up long before Keane did. Duff was
taken down in the box by Juanfran in the 64th minute, but Ian Harte's
resulting penalty kick was blocked by Casillas and Kilbane sliced the
rebound wide with an open net begging to be filled.</TE>
<TE>   "This game was all about luck," Casillas said. "We had some bad
luck during the game but some good luck at the end. After all,
penalties are a lottery, and luck was on our side. Things didn't go
well, but luck was on our side."</TE>
<TE>   Just as it was on his side when the luckless Canizares dropped his
cologne four weeks ago.</TE>

<TE>   DECIDED BY PENALTY KICKS</TE>
<TE>   A look at World Cup games that have been decided by penalty kicks
since 1982, the year the format replaced replaying games that weren't
decided in overtime:</TE>
<TE>*--*
1982 Semifinals West Germany def. France, 5-4</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   West Germany rallied from a 3-1 deficit in overtime to send the
game to the first shootout in history. Toni Schumacher, West
Germany's goalkeeper, had a save after his team had gone down a shot,
then saved another in the sudden-death round before Horst Hrubesch
scored the winner.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1986 Quarterfinals France def. Brazil, 4-3</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   After the teams played to a 1-1 tie, France's Joel Bats gave his
team the advantage on the first penalty kick, when he saved a shot by
Socrates. Michel Platini missed on France's fourth kick, and Brazil's
Julio Cesar hit the post, leaving it to Luis Fernandez to score the
winning goal.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1986 Quarterfinals West Germany def. Mexico, 4-1</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher again was the star for West Germany, saving shots by
Fernando Quirarte and Raul Servin, after the teams played to an
uninspired 0-0 tie.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1986 Quarterfinals Belgium def. Spain, 5-4</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Spain tied the score, 1-1, in the 84th minute on a long-range
volley by Senor, but Jean-Marie Pfaff made the only save during
penalty kicks, stopping Eloy Olaya on Spain's second shot.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1990 Second Round Ireland def. Romania, 5-4</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless tie, neither team missed a penalty kick through
four rounds, before Ireland's Patrick Bonner saved a weak shot by
Daniel Timofte. David O'Leary converted the final kick.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1990 Quarterfinals Argentina def. Yugoslavia, 3-2</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless tie, Yugoslavia appeared in control with two
kicks remaining and the score tied, 2-2. But Sergio Goycochea,
playing only because of an injury to Argentina's starting goalkeeper,
saved shots by Dragoljub Brnovic and Faruk Hadzibegic. In between,
Gustavo Dezotti scored the winner.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1990 Semifinals Argentina def. Italy, 4-3</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Goycochea again proved up to the pressure, after the teams tied,
1-1. With the score tied, 3-3, he saved shots by Roberto Donadona and
Aldo Serena, the latter after Diego Maradona had given Argentina it's
winning margin.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1990 Semifinals West Germany def. England, 4-3</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Bodo Illgner had replaced Shumacher as goalkeeper, but West
Germany's success in penalty kicks continued. After the first six
kicks were successful, Stuart Pearce's shot bounced off Illgner's
leg. Olaf Thon gave West Germany its final margin, after which Chris
Waddle's shot went over the bar.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1994 Second Round Bulgaria def. Mexico, 3-1</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   After playing to a 1-1 tie, neither team seemed capable of
stepping up during penalty kicks. The first three shots were missed
or saved before Boncho Genchev, a substitution in overtime making his
first appearance, scored to give Bulgaria the lead. Borislav
Mikhailov stopped two of Mexico's four shots, and Yordan Letchkov
scored the clinching goal.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1994 Quarterfinals Sweden def. Romania, 5-4</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Many penalty kicks have come at the end of dour games, but this
one rivaled the 1982 West Germany-France semifinal. After playing to
a 1-1 tie in regulation, both teams scored in overtime, with Kennet
Anderson's header five minutes before the final whistle tying the
score for Sweden. Thomas Ravelli saved two penalty kicks, including
and one by Miodrag Belodedici in the sudden-death shootout to clinch
the victory.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1994 Final Brazil def. Italy, 3-2</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   The fears of all purists became reality in the heat of the Rose
Bowl when a championship game was decided on penalty kicks, following
a scoreless tie. Roberto Baggio, whose goal-scoring had carried Italy
to the final, shot over the bar on the final play and Brazil won its
fourth Cup.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1998 Second Round Argentina def. England, 4-3</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   This game is best known as the one in which England was forced to
play with 10 men after David Beckham was red-carded for a retaliatory
foul on Diego Simeone. After the teams played to a 2-2 tie,
Argentina's Carlos Roa saved two penalty kicks, including David
Batty's shot to end the game.</TE>
<TE>*--*
1998 Quarterfinals France def. Italy, 4-3</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>

<HD>Something Old Is Under the Sun</HD>
<DH>Beach volleyball: Kiraly, 41, and Doble win Santa Barbara
Open. McPeak and Youngs win women's tournament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He grew up in Santa Barbara, learning the game from his father at age
6, a quarter mile from where he stood as a champion on Sunday after
his 143rd title.</LD>
<LD>   The landscape has changed plenty since Karch Kiraly's days as an
East Beach youth, but one constant has remained: At 41 years old,
Kiraly still knows how to win.</LD>
<LD>   Kiraly and Brent Doble defeated Eric Fonoimoana and Dax Holdren,
21-12, 21-18, to win the Santa Barbara Open, the third of seven
tournaments on the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals tour.</LD>
<TE>   Kiraly, beach volleyball's career leader in tournament titles, had
not won a championship since July 30, 2000 at Virginia Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to push the envelope a little and not be counted out,"
Kiraly said. "I still have a little volleyball left in me."</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly played only two tournaments last year because of an
Achilles' tendon injury and his season was cut short two years ago
because of a dislocated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, he had 21 kills and 13 digs in the championship match,
ending it with a kill to the right corner.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like he was reinvigorated," Fonoimoana said. "I've seen
him dig like that before, when he was much younger. I was blasting
the ball and he kept digging it up."</TE>
<TE>   It was a tough ending for Holdren, who has Santa Barbara ties of
his own. He attended nearby San Marcos High and still lives in the
area but lost in the finals for a third consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of losing here," Holdren said. "Everything worked out
for them today. They made good plays and got all the bounces."</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly and Doble beat Frederico Souza and Eduardo Bacil in the
semifinals, 14-21, 21-18, 15-9, starting the third game with a 7-0
run.</TE>
<TE>   Doble and Kiraly were supposed to play together last season, but
Kiraly injured his Achilles' a few days before the first AVP
tournament. Kiraly played the final two tournaments last season with
Scott Ayakatubby, but reunited with Doble this season.</TE>
<TE>   Doble and Kiraly had been in the hunt the first two AVP
tournaments, finishing third at Huntington Beach and fifth at
Hermosa.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like we were knocking on the door," Kiraly said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not even a pinched nerve could stop Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs
from becoming a pain in the neck in the women's tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Youngs had been bothered by a sore neck the entire weekend, but
she and McPeak defeated Dianne DeNecochea and Barbra Fontana, 21-15,
21-13, to win the title.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak (12 digs) was solid in the back row and Youngs (18 kills,
four blocks) provided punch at the net.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs have lost only three games in 15 AVP matches
this season but will be challenged on the international level. They
leave today for Gstaad, Switzerland, and could face several top teams
in a Federation Internationale de Volleyball tournament that starts
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The match was delayed nearly 10 minutes when Fontana hit her head
on the left post at the net, which resulted in a bruise on the back
of her head. DeNecochea and Fontana have lost to McPeak and Youngs in
the final round three straight times this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's timidness or that we're just not in a
rhythm," Fontana said. "We've got to bring our 'A' game to that
final."</TE>

<HD>A Kick Save</HD>
<DH>Major League Soccer is hoping the World Cup will help to
attract and educate the casual fan in U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no disputing the publicity lift soccer has received in the
United States, thanks to the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   What can be done to sustain that boost--provided largely by the
U.S.-Mexico match in the round of 16 this morning--is a subject for
debate.</LD>
<LD>   "The World Cup can only help accelerate the popularity here, but
there is still an evolutionary process in place and more time is
needed before soccer is ingrained as part of our culture," Galaxy
Coach Sigi Schmid said.</LD>
<TE>   Schmid's point is blunt commentary from an enthusiast.</TE>
<TE>   He is riveted to the U.S. games, and not only because one of his
players, Cobi Jones, is participating. He finds the action compelling
because he grew up kicking a ball daily and has been an avid follower
of the U.S. players' progression through the years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our talent's growing and what's being shown in the World Cup,
like in the win against Portugal, is that we can compete on the
international stage," Schmid said. "Physically, we can hold our
own--in fitness, power, strength and speed. We've also improved
tactically and technically. The players are more aware of game
situations, because they've played under more pressure situations."</TE>
<TE>   If Schmid had his way, he'd wax eloquently about the World Cup
beauty of crossing passes, backspin touches and the importance of the
dogged pursuit of a ball kicked free near midfield.</TE>
<TE>   He'll save it for Soccer Digest. Schmid understands the typical
U.S. sports fan isn't so enthusiastic about all the finer details.</TE>
<TE>   "We can continue to push our fans, though, and the World Cup has
proved to them we are on par," Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy defender Alexi Lalas said the World Cup matches represent
the best education possible for casual sports fans in this country
who might correlate soccer with the 8-5 game their 10-year-old child
played Saturday at the neighborhood park.</TE>
<TE>   "The more quality, high-level soccer like World Cup we have on
television, the better our perception becomes," Lalas said.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas said perception becomes knowledge and knowledge becomes a
stronger fan base.</TE>
<TE>   "Every four years, an opportunity comes along for our sport and we
either grab it, like we did in 1994, or we don't, like in '98, when
we had a bunch of bad press for not doing so well," Lalas said. "A
star can be created in World Cup. I've lived that, and it's a
wonderful thing. But it doesn't fill stadiums and what we need to
clearly understand is that a domestic league like MLS isn't the World
Cup and a city's team is not a nation's team."</TE>
<TE>   It's the job of a Major League Soccer executive such as Galaxy
General Manager Doug Hamilton to bridge the gap.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton helped arrange a Sunday night gathering of Galaxy
season-ticket holders and sponsors to watch U.S.-Mexico at Staples
Center's Grand Reserve Club.</TE>
<TE>   "We want it known that there are more MLS players participating in
the World Cup than from any South American professional league, even
Argentina's," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants it known that the Galaxy and Jones will be home to
play the San Jose Earthquakes and World Cup members Landon Donovan
and Jeff Agoos on July 4 at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   With an uncertain expiration date for U.S. World Cup
participation, consultants spent last week urging MLS and U.S. Soccer
Federation executives to act strongly and quickly to install major
marketing projects that hype the players.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsorship industry executives told soccer leaders at a Friday
Sports Business Daily round table discussion that a U.S. trip to the
semifinals or finals would result in a noticeable increase in
consumption of soccer-related items by "casual soccer fans and sports
fans in general."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the outcome, Hamilton said, he is prepared to
continue the buzz.</TE>
<TE>   "Cobi Jones has been marketable for years, and we continue to want
to parade him around as much as we can," Hamilton said. "Now, there
are so many others, like Donovan, who can make a match against San
Jose a marquee event on our schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Player agents are expected to push for advertising deals with
several companies, perhaps the most likely ones to include MLS and
Galaxy supporters such as Nike, Pepsi and McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "The MLS needs to look at the World Cup as a partner and promote
the game itself to soccer people," said Rick Davis, a member of the
National Soccer Hall of Fame and a Galaxy broadcaster. "It makes
sense: Sell the game to people who participate. That's a huge
population."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said other attractive ideas include a possible U.S. soccer
team post-World Cup tour and increased public appearances by MLS
players.</TE>
<TE>   "The game has a strong pulse in our society right now," Davis
said. "There's no time to sit back."</TE>
