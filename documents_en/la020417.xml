<HD>Uneasy Riders</HD>
<DH>An insurance report that questions the safety habits of
motorcyclists past 40 has stirred debate, pro and con, among
enthusiasts.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's two hours until noon on a sunny Sunday, and the glare from the
chrome on row after row of Harleys, Hondas, BMWs and other bikes
parked at the Rock Store on Mulholland Highway is blinding.</LD>
<LD>   The motorcycle owners are milling about the legendary restaurant
and biker hangout, admiring their two-wheeled transport and trading
tips on accessories and repairs.</LD>
<LD>   Most in the crowd are men--91% of motorcycle owners are, according
to a recent motorcycle industry study--although a few women stand and
rock on their boots before tucking their hair up into their helmets.</LD>
<TE>   On closer inspection, a good part of the crowd appears to be age
40 or older. Some say they have been riding since they were
teenagers. Others are new to the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The latter group has safety experts--as well as some of the
old-time riders--worried.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, the number of middle-age motorcyclists is
rising.</TE>
<TE>   And the number of them being injured and killed each year is
rising dramatically, according to a controversial special status
report released in January by the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, a research group funded by the insurance industry.</TE>
<TE>   The death rate among 40-and-older motorcycle riders has been
rising steadily since 1990, the insurance institute reported. And
since 1997 the rate has soared by 68%, compared with a 20% jump among
cyclists younger than 40.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its implication that older motorcyclists are more
dangerous than younger riders--to themselves and to others--the IIHS
report has drawn fire from the motorcycle industry as well as from
devoted riders.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups contend that the rising death and injury rates simply
reflect the fast-growing population of older riders and charge that
the IIHS report failed to take into account demographic shifts.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, older motorcyclists are crashing more, [because] there are
more of them," said Edward Moreland, vice president of government
relations for the American Motorcyclist Assn. The riders group calls
the IIHS report "hopelessly flawed."</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, 15.1% of motorcycle owners were 40 or older, but by 1998,
43.1% fell into that demographic group, said Mike Mount, a spokesman
for the Motorcycle Industry Council and the Motorcycle Safety
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The shift--which insurance institute spokesman Russ Rader insists
is accounted for in the IIHS accident and death analyses--has
occurred as motorcycles have become more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the motorcycling community's widespread condemnation of
the insurance industry report, old-timers acknowledge that some
newcomers don't take safety seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime riders Matt Kelch, 65, a retired airline pilot, and Neil
Reynolds, 58, a Woodland Hills architect, said they fear that the
slipshod habits of novices--those older than 40 as well as those
younger--will invite more government regulation of motorcycling.</TE>
<TE>   "We wear protective gear," said Kelch as he rested at the Rock
Store, pointing to his leather jacket, boots and a so-called
full-face helmet that protects the wearer's head, face and neck.</TE>
<TE>   Although helmets are mandatory in California, some novices, he
said, wear "beanie" helmets that cover only the top of the skull and
provide much less protection. Some newcomers, Kelch and Reynolds
said, take insufficient instruction, try to go too fast and carry
passengers before they are skilled enough to handle them.</TE>
<TE>   In California, those who want to drive a motorcycle need a Class
M1 license. After getting an instruction permit, motorcyclists who
are 21 and older can either complete the California Highway Patrol's
16-hour motorcycle course and provide the completion certificate to
the Department of Motor Vehicles, or take the motorcycle driving test
at the DMV, with three chances to pass. Those younger than 21 must
take the CHP course.</TE>
<TE>   Costs of the program are $75 for those under 21 and an average of
$200 (the price varies from locale to locale) for older riders . For
information on the CHP training course, call (800) 227-4337.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those who come to motorcycling late in life say
fulfillment of a long-delayed wish, not midlife crisis, brought them
to the sport. For some, it is the first time they have been able to
afford both a car for basic transportation and a motorcycle for fun.</TE>
<TE>   Gery Moret, 65, said he had wanted a motorcycle for as long as he
can remember--but his mother always worried that it was unsafe. His
mother died a few years ago, though, and then his son, Jim Moret, 45,
a Westwood broadcast journalist, got into motorcycling.</TE>
<TE>   Now the elder Moret has a Honda CB900 Custom and his son has a
Harley-Davidson water-cooled V-Rod. Jim Moret said it's the social
component, not the speed, that attracts him. On weekends, he will
take off from the Westside with three or four friends, ride to a
coffeehouse for a stop, then to a breakfast stop, on to the Rock
Store and back home.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Goulston, 54, a West Los Angeles psychiatrist who recently
took up motorcycling, said the getting-away-from-it-all advantages
also are attractive to older riders.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are on a motorcycle, life becomes simpler and you feel a
sense of power," Goulston said. "The only thing you need to do is
take in the sights around you, breathe in the fresh air and watch
that you don't get hit by a car."</TE>
<TE>   Some couples take up motorcycling together.</TE>
<TE>   National Guard Gen. John Iffland's fiancee, Melissa Hogan,
surprised him with a used Harley when he turned 51.</TE>
<TE>   "I had friends who rode, and it was a chance for us to join on
weekend trips," said Iffland, now 54. Rides that the commander of the
146th Air Wing of the California National Guard has taken with Hogan
include several trips along the California coast and a run from Los
Angeles to South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   In the three years that he and Hogan have been riding regularly,
Iffland said, he has spotted older motorcyclists ignoring basic rules
of safety and common sense. But they are exceptions, he said,
insisting that most older motorcyclists are "responsible riders."</TE>
<TE>   CHP Sgt. Tim Maley, an avid motorcycle rider who spent 20 years as
a traffic patrol officer before taking a desk job, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think older motorcycle drivers are less safe, per se," he
said. "But they need to factor in [slower] reaction times and the
fact that many don't drive as many miles as someone who uses [the
bike] for primary transportation."</TE>

<HD>New Honda Civic Hybrid Means Motorists Can Be Both Green
and Unseen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is weird, sitting at a stoplight with the engine off and the
tachometer needle resting motionless on 0.</LD>
<LD>   But that's motoring in the brave new world of hybrid vehicles, in
which a combination of gasoline engine and electric motor offers high
mileage and reduced tailpipe emissions but often not as much comfort
and drivability.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, the 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid also drives like a
standard Civic.</LD>
<TE>   And unlike the first gas-electric hybrids to hit the U.S.
market--the futuristic two-seat Honda Insight and the gangly
five-seat Toyota Prius--the Civic Hybrid uses a conventional body.</TE>
<TE>   So for those who don't like to be gawked at and questioned by
passersby about their car's technical data, driving the Civic Hybrid
means it is possible to be green and unseen.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic's hybrid power plant is tucked beneath a standard hood,
and other than a slightly different front fascia and a Hybrid badge
beneath the right taillight, from the outside it is just a Civic.</TE>
<TE>   Owning one will cost a bit more than having a comparably equipped
conventional Civic. The Hybrid's $21,010 price tag (including Honda's
destination charge) is about $4,000 more than that of a Civic LX
sedan. But the Civic Hybrid comes with special alloy wheels, a CD
player, upgraded seats, side air bags and remote entry--items that
are options on the LX model.</TE>
<TE>   The Hybrid's instrument panel, which has cool electric-blue
lighting, holds the normal gauges as well as one for Integrated Motor
Assist. The IMA display includes a gasoline gauge, a battery power
indicator and a bar gauge that illustrates when the electric system
is being recharged and when the electric motor is working.</TE>
<TE>   A fuel economy indicator under the speedometer lets me know when I
am being a gas hog, and it kept a running track of my gas mileage.</TE>
<TE>   One model also comes with a continuously variable transmission, or
CVT. This is a relatively new type of automatic that doesn't shift
gears but keeps the engine running at the optimum revolutions per
minute for whatever the driver demands of it--accelerating, hill
climbing or hauling heavy loads.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency rates the Civic Hybrid with
the five-speed manual transmission at 46 miles per gallon in the city
and 51 mpg on the highway, the automatic version at 48 and 47. But
EPA mileage is achieved by computer simulation, and few drivers get
close in everyday motoring.</TE>
<TE>   When I picked up a test car at American Honda Motor Co.
headquarters in Torrance, the digital readout said it was averaging
about 39 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   When I returned it four days and about 300 miles later, I had
dropped the average to 34 mpg. That's probably because, as a test
driver, I do a lot of fuel-gulping maneuvering, accelerating harder
and passing more than if the car were mine and I wasn't trying to
discover its pluses and minuses. And my drive home includes a steep,
mile-long grade that would hurt any vehicle's fuel economy.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't take the car on a long highway trip, sticking instead
with normal daily commuting and weekend shopping trips. So I never
got to see if the Hybrid could hit 50 mpg while cruising at a steady
60 mph on the flat highways through the Mojave Desert.</TE>
<TE>   But based on other drivers' experiences with the Insight and
Prius, I'd expect most Civic Hybrid drivers to report average fuel
consumption of 40 to 42 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   That's not bad, though, and the car's credentials shine even
greener when its hydrocarbon emissions are taken into account.</TE>
<TE>   The Hybrid gets the same ultra-low-emission vehicle rating from
the California Air Resources Board as the standard Honda Civic with a
1.7-liter gasoline engine. But the Hybrid's 1.3-liter engine produces
less than half the smog-causing hydrocarbons of its conventional
sibling, according to CARB data.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles such as the Civic Hybrid are relatively rare. Honda has
sold just 10,000 Insights since the model was introduced in December
1999, and Toyota has sold about 20,000 Priuses since launching in
July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Several recent studies have found that most people don't
understand how a hybrid works and often confuse them with electric
cars that must be plugged into a recharging unit.</TE>
<TE>   Hybrids, in fact, combine two or more types of power units,
usually an internal-combustion engine and an electric "helper," in a
single self-charging package. The only refueling is at the gas or
diesel pump.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic Hybrid combines a small gasoline engine with an electric
motor that provides an extra boost when needed.</TE>
<TE>   In Toyota's case, the electric motor in the Prius also provides
zero-emission electric power for creeping along in freeway traffic
with the gas engine off, a feature Honda does not offer. As a result,
the Prius has slightly cleaner overall emissions than the two Hondas.
(The EPA compares the three hybrids at www.fueleconomy.gov.)</TE>
<TE>   One thing the Civic Hybrid isn't is a racer. Its four-cylinder
engine, rated at 85 horsepower and 87 pound-feet of torque--the power
necessary for acceleration--is mated to a 10-kilowatt electric motor
rated at 13 horsepower and 46 pound-feet of torque.</TE>
<TE>   Combined horsepower is 97, versus 115 for a conventional Civic LX
sedan. But the Hybrid's combined torque is a hefty 116 pound-feet and
it is all available at a mere 1,500 rpm, so acceleration is
reasonable. The gasoline engine LX model puts out 100 pound-feet of
torque but not until the engine is revving at 4,500 rpm.</TE>
<TE>   The Hybrid's gas engine and braking system generate electricity
that is stored in the batteries until needed to provide juice for the
electric motor. The battery pack and the central processing system
that controls it all are located between the rear seats and the
trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's hybrid system works by using the electric motor as a
supercharger, giving a powerful boost to the gas engine when needed
for accelerating, passing or climbing hills and shutting down and
recharging when the car is cruising or slowing.</TE>
<TE>   There's also an auto-stop feature that shuts off the gas engine
when the car is braked to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   The system eliminates the nasty emissions that occur when
internal-combustion engines are idling. But it is touchy, and I had
to remember to keep my foot on the brake at a stop. If I lifted my
foot, the gas engine would come back to life.(Honda insists that the
frequent start-stop cycles won't wear things out faster than usual,
and the power system on the Civic Hybrid and the Insight have an
eight-year, 80,000-mile warranty, versus a three-year, 36,000-mile
power train warranty on other Hondas.)</TE>
<TE>   Unless I tried to launch from every stop sign like a drag racer,
there was no noticeable lag between the time the Hybrid's accelerator
pedal was depressed and the moment the car started rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Although acceleration is a little slower than a regular Civic's,
the Hybrid was quick enough to get me up the onramp and into the flow
of freeway traffic. Top speed is limited to 107 mph.</TE>
<TE>   As with other Civics, stopping is done by disc brakes in the front
and drums in the rear, with anti-lock braking as standard equipment.
The P185/70R14 tires, although designated as low-rolling-resistance
rubber, have enough grip to keep the Civic Hybrid tracking nicely.</TE>
<TE>   At cruising speeds, the Hybrid is every bit as comfortable and
responsive as its all-gas siblings.</TE>
<TE>   The only drawback: The control unit behind the rear seat takes up
about 20% of the trunk, leaving 10.1 cubic feet of storage space
versus 12.9 cubic feet in the conventional version. (Honda opted to
take cargo rather than passenger space. Toyota's Prius has a larger
trunk at 12 cubic feet, but with 91 cubic feet of cabin space versus
89 in the Prius, the Civic is a bit roomier for people.)</TE>
<TE>   Final words: Even at the EPA's 48 mpg, Honda Civic Hybrid owners
probably won't recover the extra cost of the car by saving on fuel.
But those who buy it--and Honda expects to sell at least 20,000 the
first year--will get an environmentally friendly car that can do
everything a regular Civic can except beat one across the
intersection.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As cars and trucks get bigger, their blind spots grow and it becomes
harder to see what's behind them. And as the world gets more complex
and demanding, parents can become more harried and forgetful.</LD>
<LD>   The result: a continuing national tragedy in which children are
dying as a result of being left unattended in vehicles or being hit
accidentally in their driveways.</LD>
<LD>   Remember the Iowa mother whose 7-month-old daughter died in June
after she had been left in a sweltering minivan all day? The woman, a
high-ranking hospital executive, told police she had become
preoccupied by her hectic schedule that morning and had forgotten the
baby was still in the minivan when she drove to work.</LD>
<TE>   A month later, in Stevenson Ranch in the Santa Clarita Valley, an
18-month-old girl was struck and killed in an accident that occurred
in her driveway when her father was backing up his sport utility
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't happen, but leaving children alone in vehicles or
allowing them to wander unsupervised around cars and trucks is
something even the most conscientious parents do, said Janette E.
Fennell, co-founder and executive director of Kids 'N Cars, an
advocacy group that tracks accidents involving children and cars.
(The group is on the Web at www.kidsncars.org.)</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that
116 children ages 1 to 4 die every year in backing-up accidents in
residential driveways and parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   As for deaths in cars, in California alone 27 children died in the
five years before legislators last year voted to make it an offense
in most cases, punishable by a $100 fine, to leave a child younger
than 6 unattended in a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Can such incidents be prevented?</TE>
<TE>   Fennell argues that if the auto industry can install systems that
warn us when our headlights are on, it should be required to equip
vehicles with devices to protect children. She believes that
available technology can thwart accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Various aftermarket products, for example, are designed to alert
drivers to the presence of people or objects behind them when they
are backing up.</TE>
<TE>   These include motion detectors that can alert drivers to small
children who may be playing nearby but are hidden in the vehicles'
blind spots. Some emit beep tones or exhibit flashing lights; others
use video screens to display images of what's behind the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   A new product marketed by American Dealer Services Inc. uses a
voice that warns drivers of potential obstacles--moving or
stationary--behind their vehicles and tells how close they are. The
company said its Micro 3 Bak-Talk uses echolocation sonar and can
detect objects in a range of one to eight feet.</TE>
<TE>   Other systems enable drivers to monitor babies in rear-facing car
seats without having to turn around while driving. These systems also
could serve to remind parents that there's a baby in the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   One such product, Donnelly Corp.'s VideoMirror With BabyVue, uses
a mini-camera mounted in the vehicle's headliner and a small video
screen integrated with the rearview mirror. The baby's image is
displayed on the video screen so parents can see if the child needs
attention.</TE>
<TE>   A tragedy similar to the Iowa case has led to the development of
an alert system whose inventors are seeking a retailing partner to
get it into the market.</TE>
<TE>   The device was developed by researchers at NASA's Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Va., after an engineer at the facility left his
infant son in the back of his Ford Explorer for nearly eight hours
when he went to work. The 9-month-old died of overheating;
authorities ruled the death an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the engineer's colleagues decided to develop a system to
alert parents who inadvertently leave children unattended in car
seats.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted something that would serve as a second set of eyes and
ears ... that could easily and inexpensively be retrofitted to
existing child car seats," said William Edwards, principal inventor
of the Child Presence Sensor.</TE>
<TE>   A weight-sensing device attached to the safety or booster seat is
activated when a child is placed in the seat; an alarm, activated by
the sensor, is attached to the driver's key chain.</TE>
<TE>   If the driver moves too far from the vehicle, the device sounds a
series of warning beeps. If the driver fails to return to the car
within one minute, the alarm beeps continuously and can be turned off
only by the driver returning to the child safety seat.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the NASA center hope to license the technology to a
commercial partner and make the device available to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what technologies are available, the ultimate
responsibility rests with parents.</TE>
<TE>   But for the sake of providing more protection for our children,
federal safety agencies should consider requiring the auto industry
to equip vehicles with devices that could help prevent such senseless
deaths.</TE>

<HD>At Premiere, Hawke Directs the Audience</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ethan Hawke is animated and chatty. He wears characteristic mussed
hair, scruff on his chin and a casual gray suit, no tie, with a
wide-collared shirt. His wife, Uma Thurman, is elsewhere, tending to
their two children, while Hawke oversees the quiet premiere of his
directorial debut, "Chelsea Walls." It's Monday night. The sun is
setting behind the Laemmle Sunset 5 theater on Sunset Boulevard as a
modest crowd of reporters and photographers awaits the parade of
Hawke's celebrity friends. Few arrive, aside from the film's stars
Kris Kristofferson, Frank Whaley and Robert Sean Leonard. (Others,
including Thurman, Natasha Lyonne, Minnie Driver and Julie Delpy
skipped the premiere in favor of the after-party at Chateau Marmont.)</LD>
<LD>   The film revolves around life in New York's Chelsea Hotel, a
legendary artists' enclave, and Kristofferson, who portrays a
tortured writer in the movie, talks about his real-life experience
staying there in the 1970s when Patti Smith was "just a little girl,"
and Andy Warhol was there to watch other artists perform like "a
built-in audience."</LD>
<LD>   Before the premiere, red velvet ropes divide the press line from
Crunch, the bustling gym next door. A few sweat-stained people,
drinking from water bottles, watch Hawke talk about his film.</LD>
<TE>   Later, Hawke tells the audience: "This movie was such a New York
experience for me. It's strange to open it here with you tonight.
[The film is] a little bit wrong for the premiere vibe." And he's
right. "Chelsea Walls" is a picture about dark moods and lonely
nights.</TE>
<TE>   Hawke prepares the audience with a short meditation. "I want you
all to think of this as if it's 10 years from now. It's a Sunday
night and you just had the most horrible misunderstanding with the
most important person in your life. And you really want to get
drunk." Then, he asks the audience to imagine that instead of
reaching for a bottle, they decided to see his film. "Should I tell
this to all the critics?" he quips.</TE>
<TE>   Food, Fame and 'Dinner for Five'</TE>
<TE>   "It always comes back to food," said Jon Favreau. "Food is the
great equalizer. It doesn't matter how important your career is, or
how crazy your personal life is. When dinner is served, that's the
most important thing."</TE>
<TE>   The writer and star of "Swingers" wasn't talking about the potato
pancakes with mango and apple chutney being passed around as
appetizers at a cocktail party at the Argyle Hotel on Monday night.
Rather, Favreau held forth on food and fame as key ingredients in
"Dinner for Five," his new reality-based series for the Independent
Film Channel. In each episode, Favreau hosts a dinner for a group of
Hollywood friends, guiding conversations that circle from food to
fame to the inevitable topic: Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The cocktail party and screening at the Argyle gave Favreau
another chance to play the host and to surround himself with his
friends in the business, including Jennifer Beals and Vince Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Dinner for Five" depends on its celebrity guest list,
Favreau said he didn't want a "glossy show." "It's more laid-back.
There's no censorship, it's looser," he said--especially since guests
had an opportunity to sit in the editing room and see that any
comments they regretted were removed.</TE>
<TE>   Favreau's main concern, he said, was making his guests feel
comfortable. "You try to invite people who would know each other and
[get along]." Vaughn, who appears in the show as a guest, added that
the experience felt like a real dinner party, he said, not a show.</TE>
<TE>   Guests during the series, which premiered this week, include Andy
Dick, Peter Falk, Marilyn Manson, Christian Slater and other
Hollywood friends whose lesser-known sides Favreau hoped to reveal.</TE>
<TE>   For instance? "Marilyn Manson knows more about indie film than
anyone I know," Favreau said.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "When I was out there and competing, and doing well in the
competition, I was quite satisfied and happy," said Walter Cronkite
in the upcoming May issue of GQ magazine. " ... What is bothersome
today is that I'm not competing at all. I'm not in the game. And that
is annoying. I wouldn't say it's worrisome, because I know damn well
I'm never going to be in the game. But it is annoying."</TE>

<HD>Seeking Words to Express the Shock of Mideast Violence</HD>
<DH>'Homicide bomber' is a new coinage in a period when
language has strained to keep up with horror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY MCNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"There is a weird power in a spoken word," wrote Joseph Conrad in his
turn-of-the-last-century novel "Lord Jim." "... And a word carries
far--very far--deals destruction through time as the bullets go
flying through space."</LD>
<LD>   When a man kills his wife and children and then himself, it is
called a "murder-suicide." Yet when a person walks into a crowded
restaurant carrying explosives and kills himself and countless
others, it is called a "suicide bombing."</LD>
<LD>   Or at least it was until recently.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer began referring to
the dozens of Palestinians who have detonated themselves in the midst
of hundreds of Israelis as "homicide bombers." National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of State Colin Powell soon
followed suit, using the term to describe one of the things that must
end before there is any possibility of peace in the Middle East.
Since then, Fox News Channel have decided to make the switch as did
several senators and media personalities, including Larry King and
Gloria Allred.</TE>
<TE>   The reason many gave is simple: "Suicide bomber" emphasizes the
wrong thing--these people are not people who simply kill themselves,
they're murderers. The fact that they themselves died in the attack
is simply not worth mentioning.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [the switch] was a good idea, a step in the right
direction," said Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at
Georgetown University. "But it's not the perfect word. It's too bad
we don't have a word that means both, a suicide killer."</TE>
<TE>   Americans, she said, like the idea of dualities, but sometimes
balance is inappropriate. Tannen said she was shocked when some news
outlets chose to show a picture of one of the young female bombers
juxtaposed with one of her young female victims. "One is a mass
murderer, one is an innocent victim; they should not be given the
same footing."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, our word choice often needs adjusting. It's been a tough
year for the English language. The destruction of the World Trade
Center by terrorist-controlled planes continues to defy adequate
naming; what was left has given new meaning to the term "ground
zero." Our president declared war on "evil" and "terrorism" without
really defining either. The word "security," which once conjured
unarmed building attendants or even a child's beloved blanket, now
identifies a whole new community encamped at airports, workplaces and
government buildings everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "After the attacks of Sept. 11, a lot of people called them
bombings simply because we didn't have a word for attack by
airplane," said Tannen. "We still don't. We settled for 'terrorist
attack.'"</TE>
<TE>   And many of our strongest words have been made anemic by overuse.
"Holocaust," "firestorm," "Nazi," "blood bath" are so much a part of
the vernacular now that they have lost most of their original
meaning. "It's all part of the universal process of language," Tannen
said. "Words get worn out so we get rid of them. Or change them."</TE>
<TE>   Such changes come from a variety of sources. According to H.L.
Mencken, the two most prolific word makers of the 20th century were
those who invented or marketed new products and the "sub-saline
literati, e.g., gossip column journalists, script writers, song
writers, comic-strip artists and press agents." But politicians have
been known to coin a phrase or two--President Bush's "compassionate
conservative," for example--to fit a political agenda.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the switch from "suicide" to "homicide" has, for the most
part, remained within the Beltway. Most news outlets, including the
Los Angeles Times, continue to use the former because it is accurate
and easily understood.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Kaplan, associate dean of the USC Annenberg School for
Communication and director of the Norman Lear Center, is not at all
surprised that a linguistic controversy has arisen from a much more
violent one. "Words do matter," he said, "and the power that controls
the terminology can often frame the debate."</TE>
<TE>   The "pro-life movement," he said, is the perfect example--although
their opponents have tried to re-dub them anti-choice, and most media
dub them "abortion foes," the name they chose for themselves is the
one that stuck in the vernacular.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan said he has no problem with such a change being inaugurated
by the White House. "Hey, new vernaculars come from everywhere, from
AM disc jockeys to kids on the playground, why shouldn't the White
House be a player in this linguistic free market?"</TE>
<TE>   But he's not clear on what problem the new term is meant to solve.</TE>
<TE>   "If you asked the average American what a suicide bomber was, if
you asked about culpability and the moral issue," he said, "I don't
think there is any real confusion. So I'm not sure this is an
important problem."</TE>
<TE>   What is more disturbing, he said, is our official definition of
"terrorist." "The stark clarity of Sept. 11 becomes less applicable
when our secretary of state is meeting Yasser Arafat. Why don't we
just call [the bombers] terrorists? Because it's become more clear
that the term 'terrorist' can get you in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   According to Nation and Vanity Fair columnist Christopher
Hitchens, who has written long and hard about the politics of words
and rhetoric, the term "terrorist" means less than nothing these
days--"it's become a propaganda tool, and is nowhere near as good a
word as 'fascist,' which at least implies intent." And the term
"homicide bomber" is almost as bad. "It's simply a tautology, or is
it a pleonasm? I think it's probably both."</TE>
<TE>   He agrees that "suicide bombing" has become outdated, or rather
the public has become inured to it.</TE>
<TE>   But the word that should be reconsidered, he said, is not
"suicide," which is accurate, but "bomber," which no longer implies
the enormity of the act it describes. "'Homicide bomber' weakens it
if anything," he said. "Bombing itself is a neutral act nowadays--we
bombed Afghanistan, after all. The term should be 'suicide
murderers.' Suicide detonations in public spaces are murders and
should be called that." "Suicide" should remain first, he said,
simply because that is how society was first introduced to the
concept.</TE>
<TE>   Few seem to think that "homicide bomber" will stick; as Kaplan
pointed out, it doesn't have anything like the power of its WWII
counterpart, kamikaze. But if one trusts Mencken, the lyricism of a
term has little to do with its staying power.</TE>
<TE>   "We Americans," he wrote in "The American Language," "live in an
age and society given over to enormous word-making.... It is an
extremely wasteful process, for with so many newcomers to choose
from, large numbers of pungent and useful words and phrases must be
discarded and ... it is by no means assured that the fittest will
always survive."</TE>

<HD>San Diego Shines Its Light on Loopy Dads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Erskine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>So we're sitting in this little border town sipping margaritas and
beer, observing that San Diego has a special light all its own.</LD>
<LD>   "Like Paris," my friend Chris says.</LD>
<LD>   "More like Dusseldorf," I say.</LD>
<TE>   We raise a toast to Dusseldorf and order appetizers. Actually, our
kids are ordering appetizers.</TE>
<TE>   Don't you love it when you segregate kids at the end of a long
dinner table, and they retaliate by ordering three kinds of
appetizers on their own, at $6.99 a pop?</TE>
<TE>   Kids who will walk right past a dime or quarter on the floor will
think nothing of ordering a $7 plate of cheese fries.</TE>
<TE>   This is the generation that will be looking out for us in our old
age, and if that thought doesn't make you pour everything you can
into your 401k, nothing will.</TE>
<TE>   "Who ordered the calamari?" I ask when it arrives five minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   "I did," says some kid.</TE>
<TE>   "What about the popcorn shrimp?"</TE>
<TE>   "Me," says another.</TE>
<TE>   This is how decadence begins. How societies crumble. Loosen the
reins just a little and there's all this youthful indulgence. Rome's
decline probably began this way. With an order of fried mozzarella
sticks.</TE>
<TE>   "Appetizer?" asked the waiter way back when.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not," said Marcus Aurelius' kids.</TE>
<TE>   We're on a mini-vacation to San Diego, L.A.'s well-scrubbed little
suburb to the south, where all the women are blond and tan and the
men ... well, frankly I don't so much notice the men.</TE>
<TE>   There may be no men here at all, for all I can tell, just
roller-blading women with their false fronts careening down the
boardwalk as if they are about to fall over forward, if you know what
I mean, gravity being what it is.</TE>
<TE>   "You really went to college here?" I ask my friend Chris.</TE>
<TE>   "Yep," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "God bless ya," I say, raising another toast.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego. Sometimes you think it's the most perfect place on
Planet Mirth, and you should move down here immediately--cancel the
cable, sell the house and take Betty and the children to live the way
God meant for people to live, a healthy, sun-drenched lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, there's all this water, seemingly lapping against
every doorstep. Sparkling Mission Bay right next door to beautiful
Mission Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-seven states have no oceanfront at all, and the
hard-working city folk of San Diego have carved out their own
Gilligan's Island? Seems almost greedy.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not all. There's this weather, too, a
climate-controlled 72 degrees at all times and a sea breeze sweet as
cherry pie.</TE>
<TE>   Move here immediately, a voice in the back of your head says. Move
to God's Country, California-style.</TE>
<TE>   "Who ordered the crab?" the waiter asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I did," say three kids.</TE>
<TE>   But there's this decadence everywhere, too, even at your own
table, and suddenly your paradise is taking on a slightly seedy,
weather-beaten quality.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, you notice that here in San Diego, there are 1,000 surf
shops but no churches apparent.</TE>
<TE>   That special light? In San Diego, it comes from the rear afterglow
of a million tourists stomping the brakes and screaming, "Did that
sign say Sea World?"</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, we walk along the boardwalk, where the evening is
darkening quickly, the color of a good bruise.</TE>
<TE>   "I like San Diego," says the little girl as we stroll the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," I say.</TE>
<TE>   It's Thursday evening, and the drunks are starting to come out.
The surf always draws the drunks and a lot of spiritual awakenings.
It must be that endless horizon. Or a tad too much vacation booze.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever," I ask my friend Chris, "had the feeling you were
on the verge of something really profound?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nope," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Me neither," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Along the sand, fires burn at makeshift beach parties. Guys with
three-day beards drink from 16-ounce cans wrapped in brown paper.</TE>
<TE>   They are a wild bunch, these beach people, Fourth World people in
a First World paradise. They curl up like question marks in their old
blankets, swilling beer and admiring the sunset. In some ways, their
behavior is infectious.</TE>
<TE>   "Look out, I'm going up," I say, indicating my intention of
walking atop the short, fat wall that borders the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?" says my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going up," I say. "Walking the sea wall."</TE>
<TE>   "No you're not," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   "People are eating," she's saying, nodding at the beachfront
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason, this strikes us as hilarious, my friend and me.</TE>
<TE>   The two of us laugh about this for 10 minutes. About how two dads
can get into trouble so easily.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't getting naked or anything," I tell our wives.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't going to moon 'em," explains my friend Chris.</TE>
<TE>   It's not so much what my lovely wife said--and you have to admire
her sense of decorum in a world so absent such things.</TE>
<TE>   What's funny is what we've become: suburban dads, guided by
suburban rules. I am, in any direction, 10 steps from being able to
purchase whatever kind of hallucinogenic a guy could crave. But I'd
better not walk atop that sea wall. . Loosen the reins a little and
... well, you know.</TE>
<TE>   So we laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "People are eating," we say over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Each time, it triggers another round of big belly laughs that echo
from here to Tijuana. For me, there are actual tears.</TE>
<TE>   The yellow-eyed beach people look at us funny, as if we might be
loopy or slightly dangerous, suburban dads high on a few days off.</TE>
<TE>   "People are eating," I tell my friend, and we laugh some more.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred yards offshore, the sea lions stop.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that sound?" the sea lions probably wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "Dads," one of them says.</TE>
<TE>   And that about explains everything.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My mother is coming to Los Angeles to live. For a year, or
permanently, depending on how the city, and such sudden proximity to
her children, suits her. She is a tiny bit nervous about several
things--after a recent monthlong trip, she wonders if the sun ever
shines in the morning in L.A., and when will it get warm enough for
her to abandon the Universal City sweatshirt my brother had to give
her because she didn't pack any heavy clothes because she had thought
she was coming to California forcryingoutloud.</LD>
<LD>   But, mostly, she worries about driving. I try to tell her that
compared with the driving in Las Cruces, N.M., where even the busiest
intersections are often devoid of stoplights, much less arrows, where
the street signs are too small and oddly shaped for even a relatively
young person to read, where tailgating seems to be a city-endorsed
sport and honking the preferred method of communication, compared
with that, driving along the regulated corridors of L.A. will be a
breeze.</LD>
<LD>   She isn't buying it.</LD>
<TE>   "How do you drive here?" she asks, as I take her to an outing in
La Canada Flintridge via the 5, the 134 and the 2 freeways. It is a
rhetorical question, but when I think about it, I realize I have a
few answers. A few personal rules of the road that allow me to enjoy
driving in Los Angeles more than most people:</TE>
<TE>   * Never get on the 405 no matter what. Likewise, never take the 5
south to the 110 south unless you have a really good audio book
you've been meaning to listen to.</TE>
<TE>   * You are either a lane-changer or you are not. If you choose to
be a lane-changer, then you must devote yourself to your craft, must
learn to move ever forward as you change lanes, seamlessly and
relentlessly, sort of like a shark. If you are not genetically
predisposed to this talent, and most of us are not, then you should
confine the number of times you change lanes to once per 20 minutes
of travel. Otherwise, you're not changing lanes so much as dithering,
and you're just slowing the rest of us down.</TE>
<TE>   * No matter how tempting, never travel any distance in the
left-hand lane of any surface street unless you intend to make a
left. You absolutely will get stuck behind someone who is.</TE>
<TE>   * If you are lost, or looking for a street address, peer at the
Thomas Guide and/or street numbers from the safety of the curb.
Slowing and stopping inexplicably in traffic spells social, and
oftentimes literal, suicide.</TE>
<TE>   * Always have at least one spare pair of sunglasses in your car.
The first time you have to drive due west in the hour before sundown
will make the reason very clear.</TE>
<TE>   * In Los Angeles, no one really knows where anything is, so asking
directions from a passerby is an absolute crapshoot. Get directions
before you start out--everyone can tell you how to get to their
house/office/photo shoot with a telephone in their hand--and get a
Thomas Guide. Some people think they can live in L.A. without a
Thomas Guide. They are wrong.</TE>
<TE>   * To find parking, you have to pretend you don't need parking.
It's a very Zen kind of thing, and it works every time.</TE>
<TE>   * In downtown Los Angeles, some of the streets go only one way.
This is confusing to many people who think they somehow made a wrong
turn and are now in Philadelphia. Take a deep breath and just watch
the signs.</TE>
<TE>   * The traffic gods in this city are cleareyed and just. Remember
this as you nastily refuse to let someone in or make a left on what
is clearly a red or contemplate stealing a parking space. You will
regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the
rest of your life.</TE>
<TE>   * Never take the 405. I really mean it.</TE>

<HD>PR Diva Seems to Have Hit a Rough Stretch of Road</HD>
<DH>Bad publicity trails Lizzie Grubman from New York to L.A.,
where valet rage erupts after a show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poor Lizzie Grubman. The driving-challenged blond seems to carry her
bad car karma with her. Between court dates, the New York PR diva,
whose clientele has included Britney Spears and 'N Sync, escaped to
L.A. to produce a fashion show Saturday. But by night's end, the
event at Koi, a new sushi bar on La Cienega, hadn't done so much for
her or for her designer client as it had spawned a new breed of
anger: valet rage.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman is facing criminal and civil  charges for allegedly
backing into and injuring 16 people outside a nightclub in
Southampton, N.Y., last summer after a bouncer told her to move her
Mercedes SUV out of the fire lane. In the most recent action on the
case earlier this month, a Manhattan judge ordered Grubman, 31, to
name the people who were with her that night, giving her 30 days to
comply.</LD>
<LD>   There's been a media firestorm over the case, with a recent New
York Times story holding Grubman at least partially responsible for
the Hamptons, Long Island's bastion of all that's summer cool, being
"over." So Grubman, the daughter of a high-profile entertainment
lawyer, Allen Grubman, has been keeping a low profile.</LD>
<TE>   Except Saturday she did anything but.</TE>
<TE>   Things didn't go well from the beginning. (Public Relations 101:
The paparazzi should be more interested in the client than the
publicist.) And Grubman didn't help matters by letting in B-level
celebs ahead of the press. "Is this a party or is it a fashion show?"
one editor snapped. (None of the incensed scribes would allow their
names to be used; fashion, after, all is a small business.)</TE>
<TE>   The extra time on the other side of the velvet rope did give
fashionistas a chance to size up the publicist. It was said more than
once that Grubman looked "scary" with her long, bottle-blond hair and
carrot orange tan. (And New Yorkers complain about L.A. style?)
Theories are still being swapped around town about how she could have
achieved the bizarre skin tone--tanning pills, tanning lamp,
self-tanner. All three?</TE>
<TE>   Grubman later escorted the Osbournes (Sharon and Kelly), Lisa
Marie, Jay-Z and other A-level VIPs into the restaurant, where New
York designer Anthony Danenberg presented his new line, V.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, fabulous-shoe king and felon Steve Madden was yucking it
up with friends near a tinkling Buddha fountain. Madden, 45, sporting
a Buccaneers cap, was sentenced earlier this month in Manhattan to 41
weeks in prison after pleading guilty to securities fraud and money
laundering. "The more trouble I get in, the better business is," he
said in his best New York accent. His eponymous company provided the
shoes for the show.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly two hours to booze before doors to the adjacent
ballroom opened for the show, spirits were soaring when the lights
finally went down around 9:15 p.m. And it's debatable whether anyone
could actually soak in Danenberg's designs, including several winter
white boucle separates (helloooo, this is L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   But the real trouble came afterward, when a glut of guests tried
to get their cars out of hock at the same time. A rumor began
floating that the valets had misplaced keys.</TE>
<TE>   As the minutes ticked away, tempers on the sidewalk flared. More
than one $20 bill was brandished, voices were raised, then, after
about an hour, the car-starved combusted. The nine attendants were no
match for the feisty crowd, nearly 100 strong. And all at once, it
was a key grab.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why L.A. fashion week will never amount to anything,"
snarled one reporter, after waiting 11/2 hours and ultimately having
to be driven to the parking garage to find her car.</TE>
<TE>   Another guest emerged from the bar only to find her Audi had been
sitting on La Cienega for 45 minutes, without her even having asked
for it. Some theorized that attendants had resorted to driving any
car out in hopes that it would be claimed.</TE>
<TE>   But the ultimate insult came from a West Coast editor who had
waited an hour inside the restaurant's ballroom for the fashion show
to start, only to be shut out after she went to the ladies' room.
After having to wait another hour for her car on top of that, she put
it as politely as possible: "Someone should tell Lizzie Grubman to go
back to New York."</TE>
<TE>   Still, you gotta give the girl credit for trying to get on with
her life. On the subject of the valet rage, Grubman said Tuesday from
New York, "You hire an outside contractor and you expect them to make
the best show. Unfortunately, there was a backup, and I'm sorry
everyone had problems."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether she is concerned that her troubles are overshadowing
her clients, she said, "I worry about that in New York, but not in
L.A."</TE>

<LD>What Is Zoodoo?</LD>
<LD>   From plastic beverage bottles to animal waste to leftover food,
the Los Angeles Zoo recycles 50% of all of its waste. Instead of
receiving 6,000 tons of waste from the zoo in 2001, landfills had to
accommodate less than 3,000 tons. The remaining waste was reused and
recycled.</LD>
<LD>   One of the biggest contributors to the zoo's waste is its
collection of about 1,200 animals. Leading the pack are the zoo's
four elephants, which produce about 500 pounds of waste daily. They
are closely followed by the rhinoceroses, which also produce hundreds
of pounds each day. Called "zoodoo" by staff, the animals' wastes are
sent to the Griffith Park Composting Facility. About 50 tons are
contributed each year.</LD>
<TE>   The zoo has been composting animal waste for many years. However,
the comprehensive Los Angeles Zoo Environmental Program began two
years ago. There are now 150 recycling bins throughout the zoo for
beverage containers. All offices have boxes for recycling white and
mixed papers. Staff also is encouraged to recycle items such as old
chlorine bottles, used batteries and old holiday cards.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo has met its initial goal of recycling 50% of its waste.
Its next goal is to reach 70%, and you can help. The next time you
visit the zoo, don't forget to throw away your beverage bottles in
the green recycling bins. Remember that every bottle counts!</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about recycling by visiting the zoo this
Saturday and Sunday during its Earth Day Expo. The two-day
celebration will feature booths for crafts, recycling information,
interactive games, face painting and more. Rascal, the zoo's
recycling raccoon costumed character, and Recycle Rex, the California
Department of Conservation's recycling "spokesdinosaur," will be at
the event, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days. It is
free with paid admission to the zoo. Learn more about the event and
the zoo by visiting its Web site at www.lazoo.org.</TE>
<TE>   This information was provided by Judy Shay at the Los Angeles Zoo,
located in Griffith Park at the juncture of the 134 and 5 freeways.

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Nicole Lindstrom gave birth to her first child last year, she
wasn't about to entrust the job of photographing his entrance into
the world to her husband.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm the photographer in the family," says Lindstrom, 32. "I kept
thinking, who is going to take pictures? I knew if my husband did it,
half the people wouldn't be in the picture." Lindstrom called Day One
Photography, a company that documents a baby's first moments in
high-quality black-and-white photos.</LD>
<LD>   At the 3D Sonography Center of Beverly Hills, expectant mothers in
their third trimester can get a glossy 3D image of their baby in
utero. Seeing the peaceful countenance of one's baby can often put
anxious expectant mothers at ease, says Dr. Robert Gergely, the
center's creator. Some bring the portraits into the delivery room.
"They use it as a focal point," he says. "It's not a knob on the wall
they were pointed to by Lamaze teachers. The baby becomes their
coach."</LD>
<TE>   Like peasant blouses and flat-front slacks, pregnancy is in.
Pregnant women are celebrated in magazines; their labor is documented
on the Discovery Channel. So why not document childbirth privately?
Particularly in these days of heightened sensitivity to the delicacy
of life.</TE>
<TE>   Liz Lonky, 25, and Shlomit Levy Bard, 29, specialize in
photojournalistic style prints. The pair started their West Los
Angeles-based Day One Photography a little over a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Stumbling Onto a Viable Business</TE>
<TE>   Lonky shot her first birth, that of her nephew, a couple of years
ago. She put together an album of about 30 prints, "like a wedding
album," she says, which she gave to her sister. Her sister and her
husband, along with Lonky's extended family, loved the photos.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until she got a call from her sister's obstetrician
that Lonky realized she might be on to a viable business. She had
given the doctor one of the prints, which he had put up in his
office. "He said, 'I've been getting so many compliments on that
photo. They're asking to hire you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Lonky did some research and found little competition in the field.
"I was really surprised," she says. "Often people are asked about the
most important day of their life. Usually they answer their wedding
or the day their child was born, and I would say the latter is
answered more."</TE>
<TE>   After operating solo for a short while, she partnered with Bard,
whose work she had admired in the defunct Westside Weekly. Generally,
only one of the partners will shoot a birth, but in the case of a
very long labor, sometimes one will relieve the other. The two ask
their clients to get prior authorization from the hospital for them
to attend the delivery since restrictions can vary from hospital to
hospital, even from physician to physician. And since most babies
don't keep to a schedule, the pair agree to be on call 24 hours a day
as the due date nears.</TE>
<TE>   Lonky and Bard are open to traveling within Southern California
and have worked with clients from as far as Santa Barbara and the
Antelope Valley. But unless the birth is a scheduled caesarean,
there's always the chance they won't get to the hospital in time. So
far, they haven't missed a birth.</TE>
<TE>   When most people hear "birth photography," Bard says, "they think
of that 10th-grade video that's very graphic. We like to create a
document and a story [the parents] can share with anyone. All
black-and-white in the delivery room helps. You don't see the blood
so much. Also, it's a great tool to capture emotion and to put the
emphasis on the excitement rather than the medical stuff."</TE>
<TE>   While it's easy to imagine the excitement of capturing a baby's
birth on film, it's a little harder to grasp the concept of the
in-utero portraits. Indeed, some might find the images a bit eerie,
but Gergely says parents react differently. "You should see the
bonding," he says. "That mother falls in love with the baby. And the
big macho American men become soft and vulnerable. They have tears in
their eyes."</TE>
<TE>   The process is much like getting an ultrasound. Gel is applied to
the abdomen of an expectant mother in the beginning of her third
trimester. The doctor then takes several sweeps over the area with an
ultrasound wand. A computer turns the two-dimensional images into 3D.
The resulting 81/2-by-11-inch images cost $250.</TE>
<TE>   Day One charges $1,150 for five to six hours of photographic
coverage, including birth and pre- and post-delivery photographs. The
fee includes up to 200 proof prints in a wood frame box. Albums of
prints, which can range from $250 to $3,000, are extra.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Day One Photography's clients are first-time
parents. "Most of our moms are a little older," Bard says. "We've
also had several clients with fertility issues. So when they get
pregnant, it's all the more significant."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the often long hours and 3 a.m. phone calls, Lonky and
Bard look forward to each birth. "Because there are different people
and different babies involved, every birth is different," Bard says.
"For a photojournalist," Lonky adds, "life coming into being is a
prime story to tell. It always has interest."</TE>
<TE>   Soon Gergely expects to make 3D video available as well. "You can
see the baby yawning, the baby moving fingers. The technology is
still not perfect. But this is where we're heading. Mothers will have
a few minutes of a movie segment." And kids who ask the inevitable
"Where did I come from?" will need only pop in a video.</TE>

<HD>Tyler Tailors His Style to Hip Sportswear</HD>

<LD>To understand Richard Tyler's new venture into contemporary
sportswear, one had only to look at Garcelle Beauvais Nilon. Sitting
in the front row of his show Friday, the television actress was
red-carpet ready in one of Tyler's sexy, strapless red chiffon
couture gowns.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by legions of young trendites in low-slung jeans and
shrunken tops, the elegantly dressed actress was out of her element.
But the models on the runway wearing his new sportswear line called
Tyler looked as if they could have been plucked from the audience.</LD>
<LD>   The man who made his name with costumes for rockers and gowns for
stars succeeded in translating his sexy, signature look into a
relaxed yet sophisticated sportswear collection, created jointly with
30-year-old co-designer Erica Davies.</LD>
<TE>   The new line offers a level of tailoring that isn't common at his
mostly under-$300 price level. The item-driven contemporary market
that he is entering needs fresh jacket ideas and the designer eagerly
complied. He topped his flare-leg, low-slung trousers and raw-edged
full skirts with everything from shrunken baseball jackets to suede
blazers, androgynous Eton-striped wool jackets and a denim jacket
made feminine with delicate, patterned string ties.</TE>
<TE>   Despite poor lighting that blinded audience members, Tyler staged
a professional presentation that was well received by the audience of
300, including stylists, buyers, journalists and celebrities such as
actresses Bai Ling, Julie Delpy and Sarah Wynter.</TE>
<TE>   It may be difficult for loyal Tyler fans, fed a steady diet of
rich fabrics and complex tailoring, to adjust their appetites to the
new Tyler "lite."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the featherweight fabrics didn't translate well to some of
his delicate dresses. In looks alone, Tyler's sportswear shares a
sensibility with Stella McCartney and her former work at Chloe, a
sign that he's tuned into the hip, pretty-young-thing vibe.</TE>

<LD>When the alarm rang the next morning, Max was already awake. His
shoes were tucked neatly beside his bed, staring at him like two eyes
on a monster.</LD>
<LD>   "Here's the dollar I owe you for doing the dinner dishes this
week," said Meredith, poking her head in the doorway and setting the
money on Max's dresser.</LD>
<LD>   "Thanks," said Max, rolling out of his bed and landing feet first
on the floor.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to leave for school in 30 minutes, don't take forever,"
said Meredith, closing the bedroom door behind her.</TE>
<TE>   Max could feel his heart pounding in his chest.</TE>
<TE>   He took off his pajamas, put on his underpants, T-shirt and
shorts.</TE>
<TE>   He found his favorite pair of white socks in his drawer. He sat
down and carefully put them on. He reached over and grabbed hold of
his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll start with this one," he said, stuffing his right foot in
his shoe.</TE>
<TE>   Something felt wrong. Max stood up and looked down at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Oops. I put the wrong shoe on the right foot!" Max heard giggling
outside his door.</TE>
<TE>   "Meredith!" cried Max in exasperation.</TE>
<TE>   "Put your right foot in your right shoe," Meredith shouted through
the door.</TE>
<TE>   "I am now!" replied Max, hoping his sister would be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   "Take one shoelace in each hand, and loop the left shoelace over
and through the right," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Done!" Max shouted back.</TE>
<TE>   "Make one bunny ear, and hold it at the bottom with one hand,"
said Meredith.</TE>
<TE>   "What next?" Max</TE>
<TE>   yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "Take the other lace, wrap it around the bunny ear and push it
through the hole where your thumb is. Then pull both bunny ears
tight," said Meredith.</TE>
<TE>   Max concentrated. Slowly he followed his sister's instructions.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it!" shouted Max. "Can you help me tie the other shoe?" he
asked, opening the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Max, if you play handball, your shoe will come untied, and you
have to know how to tie it again yourself."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll remember, I promise," said Max.</TE>

<DH>Designer Richard Tyler's new casual line is in sync with
the more relaxed lifestyle he has adopted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an artfully rehabbed former factory in Culver City,
internationally recognized fashion designer Richard Tyler calmly
negotiated the controlled chaos that buzzed backstage Friday at his
first major Los Angeles fashion show in 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   As hairdressers combed, TV cameras pointed and seamstresses sewed
last-minute hems, the shaggy-haired 54-year-old designer cheerfully
guided visitors through the racks of sleek jeans, nipped jackets,
gauzy knits and sexy dresses that make up Tyler's first venture into
contemporary sportswear. He practically apologized that some of the
interior seams were finished with machine overlock stitching, not his
usual finicky and costly seam-binding techniques.</LD>
<LD>   With most pieces in the collection priced at $300 or less, nearly
10 times less expensive than his signature line, the designer is
poised to expand his business internationally by targeting a much
wider range of customers.</LD>
<TE>   With a $15-million business, beautiful homes in South Pasadena,
Palm Springs and New York and experience at major fashion houses, the
designer could relax. Instead, the collection is challenging the
former rock 'n' roll costumer to design his first denims, new kinds
of knits and to aim for a place in the hotly competitive,
fast-turning contemporary fashion business. If he is highly
successful, however, the line could ultimately derail the
Australian's hopes for a settled, family-centered lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Coming in the middle of L.A.'s struggling fashion week, the debut
was a milestone for both Tyler and the local fashion scene. The
designer had noticeably slowed the expansion of his bicoastal,
couture-based business. He and his wife and business partner, Lisa
Trafficante, have simplified their personal and professional lives in
recent seasons. They downsized their New York shows, sold their
37-room Gramercy Park mansion in Manhattan last year for a reported
$13.5-million profit, set up smaller digs in the meat-packing
district and turned down offers to design for other companies. They
still operate a Beverly Boulevard boutique, manufacture couture
bridal wear and sell a licensed scarf and shoe line.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for the first time in his career, the famously independent
designer took his runway bow with a co-designer, Erica Davies, a
30-year-old freelancer. Together, they distilled Tyler's signature
tailoring into a casual, streetwise style that Tyler called "the
essence of L.A." This week's showroom sales to about two dozen
stores, including some from Britain and Mexico, indicated that the
sportswear is headed for a strong launch.</TE>
<TE>   The new collection also helps legitimize the L.A. look, which has
been derided as nothing more than jeans and T-shirts, though Tyler's
view includes sophisticated tailored pieces. (See accompanying
review.) His choice to debut the new sportswear line locally also
endorsed L.A. as a viable alternative to New York, the capital of
American fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Just three years ago, however, the designer swore he'd quit the
business and take up gardening rather than make cheaper clothes.
"Never say never, right?" said the designer last week at the
86-year-old South Pasadena Italianate estate that he's lavished with
landscaping, marble tables and religious art. "I'm so excited," he
said happily. "I haven't been so excited about something for a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   The events of last Sept. 11 forced Tyler and Trafficante to
rethink the meaning of his signature collection, which offered $2,000
jackets that sold at stores such as Bergdorf Goodman, Barneys New
York and Neiman Marcus, and as often as not, to celebrities and
socialites. "Couture clothing felt frivolous," he said. "I think
that's when we really decided to do this new line. The timing just
seemed appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Though they expect to reach only $1 million in sales in their
first year, the couple sees Tyler generating nearly $50 million
annually by 2005, nearly three times the yearly sales of his couture
and bridal lines. The sportswear collection is potentially more
profitable because the simpler clothes are less complex to
manufacture, sell and show.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sign of the times," said Tyler's former assistant, Los
Angeles designer David Cardona. "You either change with the times or
you disappear." Cardona, like many designers, would like to be able
to launch a secondary line, "because the second line is the one that
makes profits. It's the upper line that gets you the exposure, and
from there you do business. Most profit at the high end anyway isn't
the high-priced clothing. It's the handbag, or the perfume or the
shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Though Tyler has skipped his usual New York fashion shows for two
seasons, preferring instead small-scale presentations to select
editors there, the designer insists he's not abandoning the couture
line, just the hoopla.</TE>
<TE>   "You begin to make a product that's contrary to what you believe
in," he said, noting how pressures to remain "editorial" and trendy
sometimes diffused his own look. "It's not the way we wanted to work
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The Tylers wanted to simplify the business to spend more time with
their 7-year-old son, Edward, whom they used to take everywhere as
infant. They don't like to be away from each other or their child.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler, admitting he wasn't feeling challenged by his prize-winning
couture collection, believes he has little left to prove in his
couture niche. "He's already done his ultimate," said Trafficante, a
former actress and formidable business woman. Both also realized that
more complex times called for simpler clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have kids and they ruin your $900 pants," she said,
"it's kind of excruciating--even for me, who could get another pair."</TE>
<TE>   The change in the couple's career direction was aided by a support
system that the Tylers have carefully built over the years. Unlike
most designers who go offshore for production, the Tylers own a
factory in Monterey Park where the couture collection and the new
Tyler samples are made. Former employees own nearby factories that
will produce much of the new line. "I think that's another reason why
I love it so much," Tyler said. "The owners of the factories are my
friends. It's just like a family." Having a co-designer who
understood the demographic was equally critical.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with Erica made it easy," Tyler said. "It's probably the
first time I really worked well with somebody else, apart from Lisa."
Davies, a petite blond who lives in L.A. and Italy, where she also
freelances for Max Mara, said backstage that she likes how wearing
the couture collection can make her feel like a lady, but in real
life, "I'm more of a tomboy."</TE>
<TE>   The absence of a collaborator who understood Tyler's take on
L.A.'s sexy mix of vintage and denim is partly why he avoided a
diffusion line. But he also has learned hard lessons about
compromising his vision. In 1993, he attempted to impart his sexy
rocker style to the Anne Klein career sportswear line. Just 19 months
later, he was fired. By 1998, he had also been dismissed after a year
at Byblos, an Italian sportswear company. However, neither collection
has yet found major success.</TE>
<TE>   The experience taught him the value of being in charge. "Maybe I'm
a control freak," he said. "The [Tyler] line is what we think it
should be rather than being told what it should be." He can maintain
control of it, geographically and financially, by backing it himself
and keeping it small at first.</TE>
<TE>   His company has never had financial backers, not even now. "Not
that we didn't want them," said Trafficante. "I really thought that
when we started the business, that the right people would come in,
but it never really presented itself that way." Tyler still has
control of his company, unlike designers such as Isaac Mizrahi, Jil
Sander and Pamela Dennis, who have lost control of their businesses
because of unsuccessful financial relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm spoiled," he said. "I've always done things my way." He's
taken to heart that a secondary collection has to be distinctly
different from the signature line. His short-lived luxurious
sportswear, the Richard Tyler Collection, was priced only about 30%
less than the top line, which confused customers, according to Joan
Kaner, Neiman Marcus fashion director. The line was produced in
Italy, which guaranteed a measure of quality, but not timely
deliveries. Now in a few minutes' drive he can sort out problems at
the factory and still be home in time for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with my lifestyle now and this new collection," Tyler
said. "We used to always work 16 hours a day. Now we actually have
Saturdays and Sundays open. It's not just, work, work, work. I
wouldn't go back to what we used to have to do."</TE>
<TE>   His leisure might be short-lived, however. He's already speaking
of Tyler's possible expansion to menswear, accessories, free-standing
stores or even a housewares collection. And he's still making special
gowns for stars, such as the lavender dress that Halle Berry wore to
the Director's Guild Awards. Berry's stylist, Phillip Bloch,
applauded Tyler's new move.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has kind of gone back to his roots where he likes to
be," he said. Bloch's celebrity clients still admire his clothes:
"He's not passe," Bloch said. "And he's so easy to work with."</TE>
<TE>   Tyler's laid-back, generous attitude has won him many loyal fans.
"Everything I learned about the fashion business, I learned from
him," said Michelle Mason, one of several former assistants who
started successful fashion companies. "He's wonderful. I have nothing
but great things to say about him."</TE>
<TE>   The designer has shown a remarkable ability to remain successful
through a wide range of career challenges. "He came out of nowhere
and built a great business, and he still has that business," said
Susan Rolontz, a New York fashion analyst with the Tobe Report. "I
have a feeling that he is Mr. Chameleon. You never know with him
where he will turn up next."</TE>

<LD>Halfway through Sonny Rollins' performance at USC's Bovard Auditorium
on Monday night, he took a moment to recall having performed with
such legendary artists as Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis and John
Coltrane. And one couldn't help but wonder what it must be like for
this equally renown tenor saxophonist to play in the vastly different
settings that have surrounded him in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the musicians in the band he brought to USC to open the
weeklong L.A. Jazz 2002 festival--trombonist Clifton Anderson,
pianist Stephen Scott and electric bassist Bob Cranshaw--have been
part of the Rollins band for years; drummer Tommy Campbell and
percussionist Kimati Dinizulu are newer additions. But granting the
individual talents and the collective support they offer Rollins, it
is not a group that can provide the sort of challenges present in the
illustrious Rollins decades of the '50s and '60s.</LD>
<LD>   That said, the music that was performed was an accurate
representation of where Rollins, 71, has been musically for the
latter stages of his career. Standards and originals made up most of
the song list, and the ensemble playing was brisk and animated, if a
bit lightweight in musical density. The other players were each given
opportunities to step into the solo spotlight, diminishing the
opportunities for Rollins to revive the extended improvisational
adventures of his younger years.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, Rollins was not in an atmosphere with the real
potential to push his imagination to the limit. And it is to his
credit as a improvisatory genius that, despite his relatively
unchallenging surroundings, he occasionally tapped into solos that
dared enough to recall some of his finest work.</TE>
<TE>   His single extended improvisation, delivered over the Caribbean
rhythms of "Global Warming," was an example of Rollins skillfully
using his most resourceful qualities. Here, as in other spots, he
retained strong contact with the melody, quoting it throughout,
paraphrasing, transforming, adapting and integrating its thematic
elements into his soloing.</TE>
<TE>   On "Here's to the People," he unleashed a set of choruses that had
the feeling of a mini-history of jazz saxophone, resonating with
echoes of Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker and Coltrane, as well as
the bar-walking tenor saxophonists of the rock 'n' roll '50s. And his
cadenza on "Say It Isn't So" was a masterful display of his ability
to charge through a thicket of harmony without abandoning his melodic
touch.</TE>
<TE>   Scott contributed an attractive solo filled with open space and
contrasts of lightness and darkness on "In a Sentimental Mood," and
Anderson was a supportive front-line companion.</TE>

<HD>A Painter at Work in Sacred Spaces</HD>
<DH>After the Reformation, Pieter Saenredam found a unique way
to express his faith in the seen and unseen. The Getty takes a look.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 17th century painter Pieter Saenredam came up with a very odd,
very clever idea. In his native Holland, the Protestant Reformation
had led to the whitewashing of church interiors, as well as the
wholesale removal of their religious paintings, statues and stained
glass windows as wicked and idolatrous. So, rather than make
paintings for churches, which European artists had done for
centuries, Saenredam began to make paintings of churches. The
resourceful artist invented a new genre.</LD>
<LD>   There's never been an exhibition in the United States devoted to
the unusual architectural painter from Haarlem, but Tuesday, the J.
Paul Getty Museum opened "The Sacred Spaces of Pieter Saenredam."
Based on a show presented in the Netherlands a little more than a
year ago, Getty curators Scott Schaefer and Lee Hendrix assembled 14
oil paintings and 51 works on paper that focus on an especially
fecund period in Saenredam's uncommon career.</LD>
<TE>   The Getty owns Saenredam's earliest dated painting--a pleasant
view of the interior of a hometown church, painted in 1628 when he
was 31 (Saenredam died in 1665). It's quite accomplished, which might
reflect the unusually long, 11-year apprenticeship he spent in the
studio of history painter Frans de Grebber. The Getty picture is
included in an education gallery that helpfully explains the artist's
rather elaborate working method, but the exhibition itself looks
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, it looks at the churches of Utrecht, which the
artist painted more often than any other. On June 16, 1636, Saenredam
traveled from Haarlem to Utrecht, a once powerful cathedral city,
wealthy seat of the Catholic bishop, known for its abundance of
medieval churches. He stayed until Oct. 23. For the first six weeks,
he made drawings in and around the Mariakerk (Mary's Church), which
may have been his main objective. The next 121/2 weeks were spent
drawing in six other churches, including the imposing French Gothic
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   What was he up to? The excellent exhibition catalog refers to the
artist's stay in Utrecht as a "campaign," and that's a good
description. The work he accomplished has the thorough, concerted,
organized feel of a military maneuver. He approached his art with
methodical diligence.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't known whether Saenredam had in fact planned in advance to
stay in Utrecht as long as he did. Haarlem had been hit by the plague
in the summer of 1636, and things stayed bad until October, so there
was good reason to leave town. There was plague in Utrecht, too, but
it was easing up by early fall. Whatever the cause of his protracted
visit, Saenredam was assiduous in his business.</TE>
<TE>   He made dozens of site drawings, mostly of the churches'
interiors. Using chalk, watercolor and pen and ink, he recorded
architectural forms, spaces and details, bringing to bear a careful
technique of mathematical perspective. (His father was a map maker,
and the son brought some of that surveyor's sensibility to the
process.) Look closely at most any of the site drawings and you can
easily find the vanishing point meticulously marked on the horizon
line--a circle inscribed around a dot. If you line up one eye to this
vanishing point, the fixed illusion of three-dimensional interior
space pops into view.</TE>
<TE>   The site drawings are atmospheric and evocative. Back at the
studio, they would be turned into neat construction drawings. In
addition to the sketches, Saenredam took careful measurements of the
architectural spaces he drew, and he would plot out cross sections of
piers and columns, like an architectural draftsman. Saenredam's
construction drawings--precise, formal and linear--verge on pure
abstraction. Gone are shadows, highlights and other spatial
indicators.</TE>
<TE>   The differences between the site and construction drawings
couldn't be more pronounced. A small site drawing of the nave of the
Mariakerk shows chunky, muscular spaces that seem firm, dramatic and
even slightly histrionic. Hanging next to it, a very large
construction drawing of exactly the same view shows an interior that
is airy, fragile and crystalline.</TE>
<TE>   The construction drawings are where Saenredam cleaned up his
immediate sensory perceptions, eliminating certain details, adding
others and subjecting it all to the arithmetic laws of perspective.
Think of it as reversing the flow of artistic electricity: from eye
to brain to hand in the site drawings; and then, from brain to eye to
hand in the construction drawings.</TE>
<TE>   His rigorous understanding of mathematical perspective led to
inevitable distortions in the transference of actual
three-dimensional space onto the fictive space of two-dimensional
paper. When he arrived at a construction drawing with which he was
satisfied, he transferred it to a panel and began to paint, taking
great care with the tactile appeal of plaster and stone and the
luminosity of space. Sometimes, the painting would be made
years--even decades--after the site drawing had been sketched. The
painting was an independent object with a life of its own, far
removed from whatever had been going on the day the first drawing was
made.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 16, 1636, for example, Saenredam made a drawing of the
nave of Utrecht's Buurkerk (or neighborhood church). He used pen and
brown ink and black and white chalk on blue paper. The church
interior in the drawing is dark, low, many-chambered and vaguely
spooky.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later he based a painting on the vaults, piers,
columns and windows seen in the drawing's right half. It hangs next
to the drawing in the show, but you'll be forgiven for wondering if
they're in fact the same place. The church in the painting is tall
and willowy. Clear light glows in the rear chapels, thanks to the
abundance of plain glass windows, while the foreground spaces are
filled with a warm and inviting golden-brown radiance.</TE>
<TE>   Saenredam made a second painting based on the drawing's left half.
Unfortunately it's not in the exhibition (the painting is in the
collection of Fort Worth's Kimbell Art Museum), but its interior is
different from both the site drawing and the first painting. It's
also tall, yet a cool, austere elegance describes the blue-gray light
that crisply articulates its ethereal space. In tone, it's closer to
Saenredam's monumental painting of the St. Catharinakerk, which
provides the show's grand finale.</TE>
<TE>   There's a pointed mix of fact and fiction in Saenredam's
architectural paintings. That mix is worth thinking about in relation
to their sacred subjects. Partly they're the work of an antiquarian,
referring to medieval Catholic churches from a contemporary
Protestant perspective the way Italian Renaissance painters related
to the pagan precedents of classical Greece and Rome. (Remember, he'd
been trained by a history painter.) A political subtext also opens up
in pictures that layer history so explicitly, as newly Protestant
Holland was separating itself from established Catholic Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Aesthetically, though, Saenredam's paintings of church interiors
present something new--and maybe even radical. The Dutch Reformation
was about replacing coercive church authority and ritual with the
conscientious free expression of individual faith. Saenredam, born a
generation after reform began, seems to have taken that promise at
face value. As an architectural painter he could have chosen to paint
something other than churches--guild halls, for example, or houses.
But the specific artifact seems essential.</TE>
<TE>   Saenredam approaches the spiritual subject from a distinctly
secular perspective. He emphasizes the art involved in representing
what he sees. Art is what becomes the sacred space contained in this
work--sacred because it embodies individual thought and sensibility
engaged with a world outside itself.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is small, but Saenredam's output was small. (Only
about 60 paintings are known.) In an entry text-panel, the Getty
mentions him in the same breath with Rembrandt and Vermeer in the
pantheon of 17th century Dutch painters. That's pushing things a bit
far, but Saenredam is certainly an underappreciated artist of
impressive gifts. This absorbing, carefully assembled show introduces
his particular genius and unravels its original and inventive charm.</TE>

<LD>The Times mercifully stopped running pictures of its columnists, but
even without that weekly photographic evidence, let the record show
that your humble TV servant carries a few extra pounds--partially a
consequence of too much time on the couch (to better serve you, the
reader) and not enough on the treadmill.</LD>
<LD>   For that, lay some of the blame on television, which would be the
case even if the job didn't require staring at the blasted thing.
After all, that particular appliance has contributed to an entire
generation wearing thick glasses and loose-fitting jeans. Marie Winn,
in her recently updated book "The Plug-In Drug: Television, Computers
and Family Life," lists a variety of effects among TV's offenses,
including rising levels of obesity as well as declining physical
fitness.</LD>
<LD>   From that perspective, it's hard to get too exercised about
TV-Turnoff Network, a well-intentioned if historically fruitless
nonprofit group that "encourages children and adults to watch much
less television in order to promote healthier lives and communities."
The annual campaign asks people to boycott television for a week,
this year beginning Monday. That means the blackout period overlaps
with the onset of another rating sweeps, which, for TV junkies, is
akin to being asked to go on a diet right before the holidays.</LD>
<TE>   File it under the heading of near-hopeless causes. Despite
repeated claims that the campaign has been a success, Nielsen Media
Research figures indicate no appreciable decline in viewing during
targeted weeks since the TV-Turnoff drive started in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, such campaigns might garner better results if the
standard ingredients included less sanctimony and more plain-spoken
talk about personal responsibility. No one, for example, is
organizing "Get Up and Move Around, You Slug" Week, "Try Parenting
Your Kid Better" Week, "For God's Sake, Put Down the Chalupa and Turn
Off 'Blind Date'" Week, or "C'mon, Stop Downloading That Stuff and
Breathe Some Fresh Air" Week.</TE>
<TE>   That said, it's hard to quarrel with the notion that people watch
too much television, or that there might be more enriching ways to
spend a half-hour than tuning in "Judge Judy." What one can take
issue with, however, is the habit of do-gooder groups to exaggerate
their case, trying to convince people that viewing "Just Shoot Me"
amounts to sticking one's head in an oven, or worse, risks turning
today's kids into a generation of homicidal maniacs.</TE>
<TE>   As a case in point, in a recent announcement TV-Turnoff Network
referred to a study by Columbia University researcher Jeffrey Johnson
and others that concluded that adolescents who watched more than an
hour of television daily were more prone to violence as adults.
"TV-Aggression Link Too Strong to Ignore," the press release began.</TE>
<TE>   The research was only the latest highlighting a correlation
between TV viewing and aggression, but as always, there were some
questionable aspects to its findings. For starters, the study paid
virtually no attention to the kind of programming watched, meaning a
steady diet of "Sesame Street" would theoretically make children more
likely to be violent if they watched enough of it.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, beyond experiments measuring short-term behavior that
can't always be readily applied to the real world--say, show kids a
Jackie Chan movie, then see if they're more likely to punch or kick
things during the next 30 minutes--such research generally doesn't
account for chicken-or-egg issues, among them whether antisocial kids
are more prone to watch television, as opposed to the other way
around.</TE>
<TE>   "It's advocacy science, and I think that's always very dangerous,"
said Stuart Fischoff, a professor of media psychology at Cal State
Los Angeles and one of the rare academic voices counseling caution
when it comes to stating (or overstating) the
TV-watching/societal-violence connection.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, such studies regularly provide fodder for one
campaign or another. Even TV news outlets dutifully report them, at
times with typical bluster, as in "Can watching TV make your kids
violent? Find out the alarming news at 11."</TE>
<TE>   Not that this ritual addresses TV's excesses or helps tame a
technological landscape that keeps erupting with new options,
rendering television itself a smaller part of the media equation.</TE>
<TE>   Just this month, children ages 8 to 17 surveyed by Knowledge
Networks/Statistical Research rated Internet usage first in terms of
media they would least be willing to sacrifice, ahead of TV watching
and even the telephone. In short, media preferences are changing at
such a breakneck clip that researchers find themselves racing just to
keep pace.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently lost amid that chase is a truth no doubt patently
obvious to most consumers--namely, that TV is ultimately an
appliance, and a potentially useful one at that. From the indelible
images of Sept. 11 to natural disasters like California brushfires,
the medium provides a window on the world unrivaled in its immediacy.
Yet those accomplishments aside, its basic impulses remain to
entertain and to anesthetize, fueled by a mandate to hold our
attention long enough to make us covet products we either don't need
or need in less ostentatious quantities than advertisers would have
us believe.</TE>
<TE>   In that context, television, like anything else, should be
consumed responsibly and in moderation--something the baby boomer
generation, admittedly, has exhibited little inclination to do with
its vices and diversions. Campaigning to boycott TV, then, makes no
more sense than evicting the microwave because you tend to overeat.
Simply put, there is a less drastic solution that doesn't require an
advocacy group to realize.</TE>
<TE>   Stripping away the hysteria, of course, might bring the
TV-advocacy treadmill to a grinding halt, but who knows? When all's
said and done, throwing in a larger dose of common sense might
actually inspire more of us to put down the remote control long
enough to step on board.</TE>

<LD>   McCain Memoir Headed for Big Screen</LD>
<LD>   The producers of the war drama "The Thin Red Line" will oversee a
film project based on "Faith of My Fathers," Arizona Sen. John
McCain's best-selling memoir that delves into what he learned from
his father and grandfather (both four-star admirals in the U.S. Navy)
and how he applied those lessons when he was shot down over North
Vietnam in 1967.</LD>
<TE>   McCain, a naval aviator, refused his captors' offers of early
release and was tortured, held in solitary confinement and
imprisonment for more than five years.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote 'Faith of My Fathers' to acknowledge my first and most
important advantage in life: to have been born the son and grandson
of Navy officers," said the former Republican presidential candidate.
He said producers Bobby Geisler and John Roberdeau, having had
fathers in the military, "will bring to the subject both affection
for the honor of military legacies and an appreciation for the
challenges they impose."</TE>

<TE>   TV Movie: A New Chapter for O'Donnell</TE>
<TE>   When Rosie O'Donnell leaves the talk show arena May 23, she'll be
tackling a new one: writing and directing her first TV movie, Fox
News Channel reports. The comedian told the network's Roger Friedman
that she's been working on a project for Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   Her script is an adaptation of the novel "America," by E.R. Frank,
a tale aimed at young adults. The story revolves around a teenage boy
who drifts from foster care to a park bench to a juvenile detention
facility, winding up in a mental hospital. Production is due to begin
in the fall.</TE>

<TE>   Producer to Exit CBS' Morning News Show</TE>
<TE>   More changes at CBS' "The Early Show."</TE>
<TE>   Senior executive producer Steve Friedman has opted to step down at
the end of May in the wake of anchor Bryant Gumbel's decision to bail
out. "I don't want to start over again," said Friedman, who launched
the show in 1999 and previously worked with Gumbel at NBC's "Today"
show.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be replaced by Michael Bass, who left "Today" last year when
he was bypassed for the top producing job. Recently, he'd been
courted for a job at CNN's "American Morning With Paula Zahn."</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel is expected to leave in May and the network is still
working on a replacement. Feelers are out to Meredith Vieira,
featured on ABC's "The View," among others.</TE>

<TE>   Grant to Help Preserve Folk Music Recordings</TE>
<TE>   A cramped apartment in New York City served as one of the first
recording studios for struggling folk artists such as Bob Dylan, Pete
Seeger and Janis Ian, whose music was recorded by its residents:
Agnes "Sis" Cunningham and her husband, Gordon Friesen. The couple
also transcribed the lyrics and melodies for Broadside, a
mimeographed magazine they began printing in 1962 and sold for 35
cents.</TE>
<TE>   The material includes Dylan's folk anthem "Blowin' in the Wind,"
Seeger's nuclear war parody "Mack the Bomb" and Ian's "Society's
Child."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding such material as a snapshot of a movement, the National
Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences has come up with a $22,649 grant
to help preserve the 236 three-inch tape reels, given to the Southern
Folklife Collection at the University of North Carolina in 1997. The
money will pay for the conversion of the reels to more durable
compact discs and preservation-quality master tapes.</TE>

<TE>   Riverside Orchestra Beset With Troubles</TE>
<TE>   Egon Cholakian, a trustee of the Inland Empire/Riverside County
Philharmonic, has resigned amid questions about his qualifications.
He had been hired in February in the hope he'd oversee a turnaround
in the group's current financial crisis. Two board members
responsible for his appointment have also quit, the Riverside
Press-Enterprise reports.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-year-old orchestra had to suspend its season in March, not
long after discovering that it was running a deficit of $300,000--or
about one-third of its $900,000 annual budget. With the new turmoil,
it seems that the orchestra will be unable to resurrect plans for a
2002-03 season.</TE>
<TE>   After questions were raised about Cholakian's education and
purported experience with the California attorney general's office,
he refused to provide specifics. Contacted by the Press-Enterprise,
he declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   New Director Named at Huntington Library</TE>
<TE>   John Murdoch, director of the gallery at the University of
London's Courtauld Institute of Art, has been appointed director of
the art collection at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and
Botanical Gardens, effective Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   He'll succeed Edward J. Nygren, who retires May 1 after overseeing
the collections since 1991. Prior to joining the Courtauld in 1993,
Murdoch spent 20 years at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, the
last four as assistant director of collections.</TE>

<HD>'War' Ship's Successful Mission</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the beginning of NBC's superb documentary "Ship at War: Inside the
Carrier Stennis," anchor Tom Brokaw notes that whenever an
international crisis erupts and America needs to project military
power, one question is preeminent at the Pentagon and White House:
"Where are the carriers?"</LD>
<LD>   For intimidating potential enemies or punishing actual ones,
nothing can match the modern aircraft carrier: 4.5 acres of sovereign
American territory that can roll up beside any coast in the world and
put enormous firepower ashore.</LD>
<LD>   The thesis of "Ship at War" is that the most impressive part of
any carrier is not the technology but the 5,000-plus crew members,
particularly the young sailors whose jobs are decidedly unglamorous
and whose living conditions are cramped and devoid of privacy.</LD>
<TE>   Adm. Jim Zortman agrees: "What makes this place go are the young
sailors and Marines from all over the country--their enthusiasm and
their dedication."</TE>
<TE>   Of young sailors working the flight deck, Brokaw says, "Back home
their parents might hesitate to give these kids the keys to the
family car. But on board Stennis, their boss has no qualms having
them drive $30-million jets just inches from the edge of the slippery
deck."</TE>
<TE>   With 16 cameras and a production crew of 40, Brokaw's team was
given unlimited access to the San Diego-based carrier John C. Stennis
earlier this year as it launched combat missions into Afghanistan
from the Arabian Sea, where it had been since December. (The ship is
now en route back to San Diego.)</TE>
<TE>   The result is a wonderfully detailed, compelling account of the
mini-world that is a carrier: the controlled chaos of the flight
deck, the cramped quarters below, the ever-present noise and grease,
the tedium and danger, and the high sense of duty and accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them are pretty impressed with me having a top-secret
clearance," sailor Byron Brock, 22, says of his buddies back in
South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There are scenes of tension and edginess among crew members.
Brokaw notes that 40 sailors have gone to the brig during the
deployment, 10 of them for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   A young sailor is shown being reassigned to shore duty when a test
revealed she was "two months pregnant after 98 days at sea." Sex
between sailors is forbidden, but as crew members attest, it happens.</TE>
<TE>   An emotional high point comes when F/A-18 Hornet pilot Lt. Dave
Balsitis describes the frantic voices of soldiers calling for air
support during Operation Anaconda: "You can hear fear in the kid's
voice, and it adds a whole new meaning on top of the World Trade
Center. You can hear other Americans down there with death in their
voices. It's horrifying."</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw tags along on a mission: "As we load onto the F-14 and go
through our preflight checks, I'm focused on two goals: Not screwing
up, not throwing up."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, truth is not always a casualty of war.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Ship at War: Inside the Carrier Stennis"can be seen tonight at 8
on NBC.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Phil's Embraceable Two</HD>
<DH>The 20th Green Umbrella season ends with showcases of
recent works from Marijn Simons and Osvaldo Golijov.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its Green Umbrella Series of new music concerts, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic has made a long-term commitment to embracing the future.
Monday night at the Colburn School's Zipper Hall, the orchestra's New
Music Group closed the 20th Green Umbrella season with something more
resembling a bear hug. Marijn Simons, a 19-year Dutch violinist and
composer of astonishing talent, made his American debut, and the
program featured recent work by Osvaldo Golijov, one of the most
charismatic of American composers.</LD>
<LD>   Not everyone in the large audience was sent home bursting with
optimism for music in a new century--two old-time new musickers I
walked out with were underwhelmed. But they were surely a minority.
The electric buzz in the theater at intermission and after the
concert was more than enough to light up the dark strip of Grand
Avenue on a Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Simons takes the breath away. He is boyish, lanky, adores the
stage and seems to have a thing about Stan Laurel, whom he resembles
(one of his pieces is "Capriccio for Stan and Ollie"). As he played
the solo part of his new Violin Concerto No. 2, "Secret Notes," on
the first half of the program, his face might have been Laurel's--his
plastic expressions, along with his waves to the audience and
orchestra afterward, were priceless.</LD>
<TE>   The concerto, written for a chamber group that includes percussion
and accordion, is already his Opus 19. In the program he writes about
moving away from composing with notes and working with sonic fields.
But a lot of notes in "Secret Notes" are far from secret, although
Simons loves to bend the pitch like a jazzman or microtonalist. The
physical, jerky rhythms in the first movement, "Keep Them in the
Dark," come from the world of Stravinsky, but the scoring also has
the raw instrumental edge favored in Dutch new music. In the second
movement, "Keep Silent," lyricism turns tonally surreal. A short
conclusion, "Leaked Out," is a merry fling.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the ensemble--carefully conducted by Yasuo Shinozaki,
the Philharmonic's assistant conductor--appeared challenged, but
Simons seemed to simply dance through the solo. An old-school
virtuoso, he beamed happily with his applause and then played a Bach
encore in a robust Romantic manner.</TE>
<TE>   The second half of the program, which was turned over to Golijov,
was the culmination of the composer's residency with the Philharmonic
this season. And it was the first chance in Los Angeles to hear music
from his breakthrough "Passion According to St. Mark."</TE>
<TE>   The immediacy of Golijov's music wins over audiences with such
ease that one waits for the backlash. But just the opposite. As he is
getting better known, even his failures are proving attractive, not
failures at all. Such was the case with the score he wrote to Sally
Potter's film "The Man Who Cried," which can seem affectedly eclectic
in the context of an affected movie. But "Lullaby and Doina," based
on variations from a Yiddish lullaby he adapted as counterpoint to a
Bizet aria, succeeds in a new chamber version for flute, clarinet and
strings. The lullaby now morphs into a gypsy dance with ease.</TE>
<TE>   A recent song, "How Slow the Wind," for soprano and string
quartet, with a text adapted from Emily Dickinson, demonstrated
Golijov's increasing ability to find the core of emotional expression
in pure music, every transparent gesture beautifully conceived.
Jessica Rivera was the shining soprano.</TE>
<TE>   Three arias from "Passion"--those for Jesus and the apostles Judas
and Peter--offered only a 15-minute taste of the evening-long work
(which will be given its West Coast premiere in October at the
Eclectic Orange Festival in Orange County). But, with Rivera, the
gripping Brazilian mezzo-soprano, Luciana Souza (who sang in the
premiere in Stuttgart, Germany, in 2000) and excellent contributions
by the Los Angeles Master Chorale and Philharmonic players, conducted
by Shinozaki, there was at least a sense of the panoramic range of
this remarkable compendium of Latin music. Yet another side of
Golijov, who came to the U.S. from Buenos Aires via Jerusalem, was
heard in a piano quartet he put on the program--"About an Old Tune,"
by his Israeli composition professor, Mark Kopyman. It is a
passionate evocation of Jewish folksong in sliding strings and
tolling piano and was given a powerful performance.</TE>
<TE>   Although this concert marked the end of the Green Umbrella season,
the Philharmonic can't quite keep itself from yet one more hug--it
has added a special concert next month at UCLA devoted to Toru
Takemitsu.</TE>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a key moment in Clare Pep- loe's film of Pierre Marivaux's 1732
romantic farce "The Triumph of Love," during a scene in a
360-year-old outdoor theater when the director cuts to a brief shot
of an audience looking on, it becomes clear this entire production
should be taking place on stage.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the sumptuous period piece has a cinematic flow and
visual grace, Peploe strikes an unvarying, intensely theatrical note
that creates an aura of archness and slides swiftly into tedium. The
result is an exquisite yawn that provokes consideration of how
accomplished Ben Kingsley, Fiona Shaw and Mira Sorvino and others are
as actors--but how in this instance the characters they play so
intensely never come alive.</LD>
<LD>   "Triumph of Love" is a trifle as delicate and vulnerable as a
souffle, and it takes an infinitely lighter touch and variety of tone
than Peploe brings to it despite her long and notable career in
international film production, including a professional and personal
relationship with Bernardo Bertolucci and writing and directing her
own films.</LD>
<TE>   Sorvino stars as a princess whose father had usurped the throne of
the ruler who has died in prison, as has his consort. The princess,
however, has caught sight of their son Agis (Jay Rodan) bathing nude
in a stream and has fallen in love with him in an instant. If only
she could win his heart he might then rightfully ascend the throne.
There is, of course, a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   From the age of 8 Agis has been raised by the rationalist
philosopher Hermocrates (Kingsley) to abhor emotion and regard the
princess with complete hatred. Hermocrates shares a beautiful country
estate of infinite charm with his spinster scientist sister Leontine
(Shaw).</TE>
<TE>   What is the princess to do but dress herself and her
lady-in-waiting Hermidas (Rachel Stirling) in male garb and leap over
the wall onto Hermocrates' property? Fast on her feet, the princess,
now calling herself Phocion, a young scholar in search of
intellectual and spiritual stimulation, sets out to seduce brother
and sister alike, with Hermocrates swiftly deducing she is a woman,
while befriending the lonely, handsome and innocent Agis. It takes a
lot of talk and complications for everything to be sorted out, and
interest wanes long before the film reaches the end of its 107-minute
running time.</TE>
<TE>   The production values could scarcely be more elegant--glorious
authentic locales, delightful costumes and a sprightly,
period-sounding score by Jason Osborn that contributes vitality to
the film that is otherwise lacking. "Triumph of Love," alas, is all
technique and no heart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Maturing 'Dawson' Reflects on Past</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Its randy band of high schoolers now running fast and loose in the
adult world after last season's graduation, "Dawson's Creek" marks a
watershed moment tonight with the airing of its 100th episode (8
p.m., WB).</LD>
<LD>   Yet that accomplishment comes not so much with a sense of security
or momentum, but with a current of anxiety that seems to be running
through the show's fans as well as its characters. You can almost
hear longtime viewers chewing their fingernails on the show-related
Web site chat boards--at least from the ones who haven't already
thrown up their hands in frustration over the series' new direction.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, after four seasons of hormonally driven high school high
jinks, set in the cuddly cocoon of a leafy Boston suburb, the series
has been forced to come to grips with the maturing aspirations of its
principal players, which threaten to scatter them across the country.</LD>
<TE>   Dawson's (James Van Der Beek) dreams focus on USC's film school.
Joey (Katie Holmes, whose adorability is still the show's center),
Pacey (Joshua Jackson), Jen (Michelle Williams) and Jack (Kerr Smith)
are going their separate ways in and around Boston. Is there still a
show in there somewhere?</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's episode, "100 Light Years From Home," ducks the question
for the time being by having the cast spend a reflective spring break
together in Florida. It's an hour of sepia-toned flashbacks and
rueful what-ifs, of mismatched emotions and tense ultimatums, of
stomping and seething and a bit of heavy breathing.</TE>
<TE>   In short, it's business as usual on "Dawson's Creek."</TE>

<LD>Buoyed in part by afternoon coverage of the Masters golf tournament,
CBS turned in a solid prime-time scorecard Sunday to claim the week,
as "The Pilot's Wife" landed the network's highest movie rating this
season, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media
Research.</LD>
<LD>   Several high-rated series were in reruns last week, including
"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," which nevertheless topped the
weekly standings. Among spring tryouts, meanwhile, "Baby Bob"
continues to deliver as part of CBS' Monday lineup, while ABC's "The
Bachelor" and "The George Lopez Show" are performing moderately well
based on their time periods.</LD>
<LD>   Casualties include ABC's "Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)" and "The
Court" as well as Fox's "The American Embassy" and CBS' "AFP:
American Fighter Pilot." Other newcomers, among them Fox's "Andy
Richter Controls the Universe" and "Greg the Bunny" and NBC's
"Watching Ellie," have seen discouraging declines after promising
starts.</LD>
<TE>   CBS and NBC continue to run far ahead of ABC and Fox, while NBC
enjoys a wide margin of victory in the young-adult demographics
sought by advertisers. ABC's malaise is such that its most watched
show, "PrimeTime Thursday," ranked No. 23 overall last week. The
newsmagazine posted its third-highest rating this season.</TE>

<HD>Greek Bearing Riffs</HD>
<DH>Comedian Nia Vardalos' love of her colorful family's
heritage inspires her film's humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former agent once told Nia Vardalos she would never make it as an
actress in Hollywood because she wasn't pretty enough to be a star
and wasn't fat enough for character roles.</LD>
<LD>   So, after two years of doing voice-overs for commercials like Tide
detergent and Home Depot and constantly being mistaken for Latina or
Italian, Vardalos, a Canadian of Greek descent, decided to take
matters into her own hands. She wrote and starred in a one-woman
stage act rooted in something close to her heart: Greek families,
where fathers believe Windex is a cure-all for every malady,
grandmothers believe Turks are out to kidnap them, and daughters are
expected to marry nice Greek boys in the Orthodox church and have
babies instead of careers.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the 32-year-old Vardalos has parlayed the humorous tales
and idiosyncratic characters she remembers growing up in Winnipeg's
Greek Town into a screenplay and starring role in a movie called "My
Big Fat Greek Wedding."</LD>
<TE>   What's more, her producers include actress Rita Wilson, who is
half-Greek, and Wilson's mega-star husband, Tom Hanks. But even with
that kind of clout it's been an uphill battle to bring Vardalos'
story to the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, who with this film takes the reins as a producer for the
first time, said she had to fight to get the movie made because no
one wanted to go with an unknown actress in the lead role.</TE>
<TE>   "When we pitched it at the studios, they said they liked the idea
but didn't want Nia to star in it," Wilson said. "But I felt strongly
it should be her. As a woman, I feel women get the shaft all the
time. You do the play and then they cast someone else. You're not a
big star and, therefore, they won't even look at you."</TE>
<TE>   Vardalos' story is a familiar one in star-obsessed Hollywood,
where unknown actors repeatedly have doors slammed in their faces
unless they happen to get noticed by someone with power who isn't
afraid of taking risks.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get a job," Vardalos said. "I had a lousy agent, and
then I realized that everybody [who is unknown] has one."</TE>
<TE>   How bad was it?</TE>
<TE>   "I had given my agent 100 [head shots] and when she finally
dropped me, I went to pick up my pictures and there were 98 there!"
Vardalos said. "I wanted to shake her and say, 'I want my two years
back!'"</TE>
<TE>   Wilson and Hanks</TE>
<TE>   Come to Vardalos' Show</TE>
<TE>   In a weird way, however, those lost years served to propel
Vardalos to make decisions that would secure her breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   This Friday IFC Films will release "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" in
nine U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, and
Vardalos invited 50 family members to the L.A. premiere. The film,
which was shot in Toronto, was produced by Gold Circle Films and
Hanks' production company, Playtone Co.</TE>
<TE>   For Vardalos, life hasn't really been the same since late 1997,
when Wilson, wondering why more attention was not being paid to the
L.A. stage scene, happened to scan the theater ads in a newspaper one
day and came across an intriguing-sounding show called "My Big Fat
Greek Wedding" that was running at the Acme Comedy Theatre on La Brea
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said she was "completely floored" by Vardalos' comic
routine. "Not only did it remind me of my life and my family--part of
whom were with me--but I just loved Nia," Wilson said. "My mother is
Greek and my father is Bulgarian. I am a first-generation American
and native Los Angeleno. I was born and raised in Hollywood. I would
go to school and be American and then come home and be Greek. That is
why I related to this story on so many levels."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson met Vardalos after the show and learned that she had
written a screenplay based on the same material. At his wife's
urging, Hanks later took in the show, and it was an evening that
Vardalos will never forget.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first 10 seconds of the show, I couldn't see any faces in
the audience because all the heads were turned to them," Vardalos
said. "I could just see a sea of ears. Then he laughed at the first
joke and you could almost hear the audience say, 'Oh, it's going to
be all right' and then they all turned and looked at me. I almost
wanted to say on the 11th second, 'Yes, I know!'"</TE>
<TE>   Vardalos is the first to admit that she owes much of that newfound
success to her Greek family, from father Gus (the name of the father
in the movie) and mother Doreen to grandmothers Antonia and Eugenia
(hence the name Nia), and 27 first cousins and other relatives whose
lives provided her with a rich trove of comic material.</TE>
<TE>   "I have friends who are way more talented than me," Vardalos said,
"but they don't have a Greek family that they can milk for material.
My mom would say things to me like, 'Greek women may be lambs in the
kitchen, but we're tigers in the bedroom!' I would go to a party that
night and I would say that line and it would kill. Everybody would
laugh so hard. And I said, 'There is something here.'"</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview at a tony Hollywood restaurant, where she
limits her order to iced tea, Vardalos displays the high-octane
confidence and darting wit one would expect from a comedian honed on
six years of performing with Second City in Toronto and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   With a broad smile, throaty laugh and an oversupply of hair piled
in swirls atop her head, she is a commanding presence even at 5 feet
6, and the jokes she serves up are as plentiful as plates of olives
and feta cheese at a Greek restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, directed by Joel Zwick (who directed Hanks in the
early '80s sitcom "Bosom Buddies"), Vardalos plays Toula Portokalos,
a frumpy, bespectacled, unmarried woman of 30 working the counter at
her parents' Chicago-area restaurant, Dancing Zorba's. Michael
Constantine plays her dad, Gus, while Lainie Kazan is her mom, Maria.
Rounding out the cast are John Corbett ("Sex and the City"), who
plays Toula's handsome, non-Greek love interest, Ian; Gia Carides as
her big-haired, busty cousin Nikki; Joey Fatone of 'N Sync fame as
cousin Angelo; and Andrea Martin as Aunt Voula. Vardalos' husband,
Ian Gomez ("Felicity"), is also in the film.</TE>
<TE>   As the movie opens, Toula is riding in a car driven by her dad
staring out at the rain.</TE>
<TE>   "You better get married soon," he bluntly tells his daughter.
"You're starting to look old."</TE>
<TE>   Toula takes the slight in stride. After all, as she explains in
her narration: "My dad has been saying that to me since I was 15,
because nice Greek girls are supposed to do three things in
life--marry Greek boys, make Greek babies and feed everyone until the
day we die." Toula says she always knew growing up she was different
because "the other girls were blond and delicate and I was a
46-year-old with sideburns."</TE>
<TE>   The Portokalos family lives in a tasteful, middle-class
neighborhood in Chicago's Greek Town, where their home is decorated
with Corinthian columns, Greek statuary on the lawn and a giant Greek
flag emblazoned across the garage door.</TE>
<TE>   What follows is a sendup of nearly everything Greek, from
bridesmaids wearing turquoise gowns to a sea of loud-talking,
backslapping Greek relatives swarming around the groom's tidy, quiet
and slightly frightened WASPish parents.</TE>
<TE>   Vardalos said her first break in acting came while working in the
box office at Toronto's Second City, when one of the actresses got
sick one night and they couldn't locate her understudy.</TE>
<TE>   "So, I just thought, 'I have to do it,'" Vardalos said. "I went
backstage, knocked on the door, and I said, 'I'm a member of Actors'
Equity and I think I know your show.' And they put me on! ... Is that
insane? The audience must have seen me take their tickets and then 10
minutes later I was on stage wearing sweatpants, sneakers and
goggles--my great big glasses."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, after six years with Second City, she headed for
Hollywood with visions of making it big. When reality set in, a
friend she had worked with at Second City suggested they each write a
one-act routine in hopes of getting noticed by a better agent.</TE>
<TE>   Vardalos tried out her jokes at a club that featured an open-mike
night. People laughed. When she put together an hour's worth of
material, she began passing out fliers and selling tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "I called my mom and said, 'I went to church and handed out fliers
to my show,'" Vardalos said. "And she said, 'Oh, my God! The icons
will weep!'"</TE>
<TE>   Three production companies approached her with offers to buy the
material, but they balked at casting her in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I would like to play the lead and they said, 'Yeah,
right,'" Vardalos said. "Then I got worried. They were kind of waving
these big checks at me, but I didn't come here to sell an idea about
my family, especially when they were telling me they were going to
change it to Hispanic or Italian. This guy said, 'Everybody loves
Italians.' I said, 'You know what? I love them, too!'</TE>
<TE>   "So, I started to think, if I'm going to be the Greek girl in
town, I'm going to be the Greek girl in town," she said. Fearful that
someone might steal her idea, she dashed off a screenplay in three
weeks and sent it off to the Library of Congress to be copyrighted.</TE>
<TE>   "The day I got the copyright in the mail that said, 'You own these
characters, you own this story,' that is the night Rita Wilson came
to the show," she said. "Is that nuts?"</TE>
<TE>   Now Vardalos' budding career is being guided by heavyweight
Hollywood management agency Brillstein-Grey, which, along with
Wilson, has produced a sitcom pilot for CBS co-written by and
starring Vardalos. She is also busy on another screenplay, this one
about two girls from Chicago on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Vardalos praises Wilson and Hanks for not only making the movie
the way she envisioned it, but also going with their gut instincts
and casting her in the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "They were so respectful that this came from my heart and my
family," she said. For the casting, "Rita put her foot down and said,
'We must find as many Greeks as possible.'"</TE>

<DH>Imax enlists the aid of astronauts to make the 3-D movie
'Space Station.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY ZONE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Space Station orbits 220 miles above the Earth at a
speed of 17,500 mph. So when Imax decided to make a film about the
construction of the space station, it needed to enlist the help of
some very special filmmakers: astronauts.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, 25 astronauts worked on the 3-D film "Space Station,"
which opens Friday at several Imax theaters around Southern
California. The filming took place during seven flights of the space
shuttle Discovery and documents the second phase of space station
construction, from the rocket launch of the first component from
Kazakhstan in November 1998 to the July 2001 installation of the crew
airlock, which made the station ready for human habitation.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to do everything well to shoot a good scene," says Air
Force Col. Brian Duffy, one of the astronaut filmmakers. "So the
pressure was on to make sure we got it right." Duffy was commander of
the six-man crew that flew on the first shuttle flight equipped with
the Imax 3-D camera in October 2000. With Mission Specialist Koichi
Wakata and Lt. Col. Pam Melroy, Duffy photographed three different
space walks and installation of the Z1 truss, the "backbone" of the
station. The film is narrated by Tom Cruise.</LD>
<TE>   For the large-format filming of the space station, the astronauts
used two groundbreaking 65-millimeter cameras built especially for
the project by Martin Mueller of MSM Design.</TE>
<TE>   "The in-cabin 3-D camera was created for interior use to be
hand-held by the astronauts to document life in orbit," Mueller says.
Though weightless at zero gravity, the hand-held camera uses matched
pairs of lenses and a video viewfinder and weighs 95 pounds fully
loaded with 1,250 feet of film, which yields a running time of 2
minutes at standard speed. "There was early concern about the effect
of zero gravity on the operation of the camera," Mueller says, "but
since the film mechanism accelerates and decelerates so quickly, we
felt gravity would not be missed."</TE>
<TE>   "At zero gravity," says Duffy, "you wanted to shoot all your
scenes with a good foothold so that you could stay in one steady
position."</TE>
<TE>   The 25 astronaut-filmmakers were trained for 3-D filming in space
by James Neihouse, director of photography on the space station.
Neihouse is a veteran of 26 large-format films who has worked on four
previous Imax space projects produced in conjunction with NASA. "We
trained the crews about all aspects of composition for large-format
3-D cinematography," Neihouse says. "While we trained the astronauts
on camera matters, they trained us on what was happening on their
flight."</TE>
<TE>   The astronauts practiced loading and filming with the camera in a
space station mock-up at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "The training we received on the ground was so good that we had
very few surprises in orbit," Duffy says. "For the scenes that I
shot, I tried to induce motion to help enhance the 3-D effect."</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to get the astronauts to take advantage of 3-D space
while filming," Neihouse says. "We have to make sure they let things
float out into the audience every once in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Many scenes in "Space Station" make dramatic use of zero gravity
with visual elements floating about. Popcorn floats out as an
astronaut opens a bag. Another astronaut sends oranges slowly flying
out into the audience as he distributes them to fellow crew members.</TE>
<TE>   "Imax camera movements in 3-D have to be slow," Neihouse says. "In
zero gravity, it's really easy to whip the camera around. But
fortunately, astronauts tend to move slowly in orbit just for
self-protection."</TE>
<TE>   For interior lighting the crews had four small, portable, 150-watt
lights on board. The second Imax 3-D camera used for "Space Station"
was bolted to a side rail inside an insulated housing with a quartz
window in the cargo bay of the Discovery shuttle. This camera
captured bird's-eye views of space walks and station assembly. "We
were controlling the cargo-bay camera by using a laptop computer on
the flight deck of the space shuttle," Duffy says. "We could see
through the lenses of that camera and change them to see what the
camera was looking at."</TE>
<TE>   Toni Myers, who produced "Space Station," said new technology
allowed the astronauts more flexibility. "It just wasn't possible to
launch bulky cameras on the space shuttle. Our big revolution is
compressing a lot of cinematic engineering into a very tiny space,"
Myers explained. "For that we use a single strip of film exposing the
right-eye and left-eye views simultaneously traveling twice as fast
through the camera."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Space Station" opens Friday at California Science Center, 700
State Drive, Exposition Park, (213) 744-7400; the Bridge, 6081 Center

<LD>Mushrooms add interesting flavors to dishes, and different mushrooms,
treated in different ways, even more so.</LD>
<LD>   These recipes use three different mushrooms. The panini, topped
with portabellos, make a satisfying, casual meal. Marta Curca, a
friend from Romania, makes this unusual mushroom soup with wild
mushrooms and white mushrooms. It's substantial but not heavy. When
buying mushrooms, be sure to choose those that are blemish-free with
a fresh, smooth, firm surface. Always refrigerate fresh mushrooms. If
they are wrapped in plastic, remove it before storing them. Leave
them exposed to the air in the container or wrap in paper towels.</LD>
<LD>   When ready to use, try to brush fresh mushrooms clean; wash them
only if they're especially dirty by placing them in a colander and
quickly rinsing with cold water. Dry with paper towels. Trim off any
bruised spots, tough or dirty ends or edges, and the stem if it looks
dry. Remove the dry fibrous end of a portabello stem and its gills.
Use a melon baller or a grapefruit spoon to remove the gills.</LD>

<TE>   BASIL VINAIGRETTE</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup fresh basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Combine the basil leaves, vinegar, garlic, mustard, salt and
pepper in a mini-processor. Add the oil; mix well. (This can be made
a few hours ahead and left at room temperature.) Set aside 3
tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons for the mushrooms and onions.</TE>
<TE>   PANINI</TE>
<TE>   4 large portabello mushrooms, about 1 pound 4 ounces, stems
trimmed, gills removed</TE>
<TE>   1 large red onion, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   8 thin slices rustic bread</TE>
<TE>   36 leaves baby arugula, about 2 ounces, stems trimmed</TE>
<TE>   4 ounces Fontina cheese, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil spray</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Brush both sides of the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons plus 2
teaspoons of the reserved vinaigrette. Arrange the mushrooms in a
single layer on a baking sheet. Place the onion slices in a bowl;
toss with the remaining reserved tablespoon of vinaigrette. Mound
them on the baking sheet with the mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the mushrooms are tender and the onions are cooked down
but still retain some texture, about 25 to 30 minutes. Set them aside
until cool enough to handle, then cut the mushrooms on the bias into
4 to 5 slices. Coarsely chop the onions. (This can be done several
hours ahead; keep at room temperature.)</TE>
<TE>   To assemble, brush some vinaigrette on the bread. Divide the
onions evenly and spread them on 4 slices. Arrange the arugula on
each to cover, dividing evenly. Layer the cheese over each. Fan each
portabello, overlapping, over the cheese. Season with salt, pepper
and red pepper flakes. Close the panini. (This can be done several
hours ahead.)</TE>
<TE>   Spray oil on a large grill pan or frying pan. Heat until hot over
medium heat; lightly spray oil on the outer surfaces of the panini.
Cook, covered, until browned on one side, 3 minutes; turn, gently
compress, then brown the other side, about 3 minutes more.</TE>
<TE>   Let rest 5 minutes before cutting in half. Serve hot.</TE>

<TE>   1/3 cup minced fresh dill</TE>
<TE>   Soak the dried mushrooms in 1 cup of hot water for 15 minutes.
Drain, reserving the liquid.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a heavy pot over medium-high
heat. Cook the onion until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the
sliced mushrooms; cook until they exude moisture, about 6 minutes.
Stir in the dried mushrooms. Measure the reserved mushroom liquid
with water to make 4 1/2 cups. Add to the pot. Add the salt and
pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, half-covered,
for 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the potato in simmering water until soft, about 15 minutes;
reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Mash the potato until smooth;
stir in the liquid.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a small nonstick pan
over medium heat until light brown; stir in the flour. Cook 4
minutes. Stir in the garlic; cook until the garlic just starts to
brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the reserved
potato mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Stir the mushrooms into the flour mixture. Simmer until thickened,
about 10 minutes. Drizzle 1/2 cup of the hot soup into the sour cream
mixture, stirring constantly. Slowly stir back into the soup. Add the
parsley and dill. If the soup is too thick, add more water.</TE>

<HD>A Whole Bunch of Asparagus Tips</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been served asparagus so soft and limp it seemed to come out of
a can. What a waste of a fresh springtime treat!</LD>
<LD>   Cook asparagus briefly and check often to be sure it retains a
little crunch. Some insist on tying asparagus in bundles or steaming
it in an asparagus cooker but you don't have to.</LD>
<LD>   The most practical technique is to handle the spears like other
green vegetables: Boil them briefly in salted water, then rinse them
with cold water if you're not eating them right away. This stops the
cooking process and keeps their color vivid.</LD>
<TE>   If you're serving the boiled asparagus hot, heat it for a minute
or two in butter or oil with seasonings. You can also toss thick,
whole, unpeeled asparagus spears with oil and roast them at 450
degrees for 10 minutes or even grill them for a few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Asparagus is most tender at the tip. The spear's upper third is
good even raw. Toward the bottom the stalk becomes tough, and its
woody base must be removed.</TE>
<TE>   Pencil-thin asparagus stalks do not require peeling, but I find
that thicker ones are often more flavorful. I usually peel the lower
part so it will be as tender as the top.</TE>
<TE>   To peel asparagus, lay it on a work surface, peel it from halfway
down the spear toward the base, turn it and peel it again. (If you
hold the stalk in the air like a cucumber, it might break during
peeling.)</TE>
<TE>   Don't throw the bases and peelings away. Cook them in water with
carrot and onion trimmings for 30 minutes, and you'll get a savory
vegetable broth.</TE>
<TE>   Choose asparagus that's firm but not dried out, with compact,
closed tips. Remove any rubber bands and refrigerate the vegetable
unwashed in a plastic bag up to three days.</TE>
<TE>   Wrapping the bases in damp paper towels helps keep the asparagus
fresh.</TE>

<TE>   Asparagus Salad With Carrots and Shiitake Mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 1 hour * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   With its simple, Chinese-inspired dressing, this colorful salad is
good hot or cold, as an appetizer or as a partner for meat or
chicken. If you like, cook the vegetables ahead. If you're serving
them hot, heat them in a little oil for extra richness and shine,
then add the dressing directly to the skillet. For serving cold, add
the asparagus at the last moment.</TE>
<TE>   8 large dried shiitake mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound asparagus spears, peeled if over 1/4 inch thick</TE>
<TE>   2 or 3 long, slim carrots (about 1/2 pound), peeled</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons hoisin sauce, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons rice vinegar, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   2 to 5 teaspoons vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Few drops hot sauce, optional</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons chopped green part of green onions, optional</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon Asian sesame oil</TE>
<TE>   Place the mushrooms in a bowl. Cover them with hot water and let
them soak until soft, about 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms, rinse
them and cut off the tough stems. (You can save them for simmering in
vegetable stock). Slice the mushroom caps.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Cut the
asparagus on the bias in 3 or 4 pieces, discarding the tough white
bases (about 1/2 inch from the end). Cut the carrots in diagonal
pieces about the same length as the asparagus pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Add the asparagus to the boiling salted water; it should be
covered generously. Boil until the pieces are barely tender, about 2
or 3 minutes; to check, lift a few on a slotted spoon and pierce them
with a knife tip. Drain the asparagus, reserving the liquid. Rinse
the asparagus with cold running water and drain it well.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the asparagus cooking liquid, carrots, mushrooms and a
pinch of salt in the saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer
until the carrots are just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well. (The
liquid makes tasty stock.)</TE>
<TE>   For the dressing, whisk the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of hoisin sauce
and 2 teaspoons of vinegar in a small bowl until combined. Whisk in 2
teaspoons of vegetable oil and a little salt, pepper and hot sauce.</TE>
<TE>   To serve the salad hot, heat 2 to 3 teaspoons of vegetable oil in
a skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, asparagus and carrots
and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until hot, about 30 seconds. Add
the dressing and heat for a few seconds, shaking the pan. Turn off
the heat, add the green onions and sesame oil and toss to combine.</TE>
<TE>   To serve the salad cold or at room temperature, toss the dressing
with the carrots and mushrooms. Just before serving, add the
asparagus, green onions and sesame oil.</TE>
<TE>   Taste and adjust the amounts of salt, pepper, hoisin sauce and
vinegar.</TE>

<HD>Black-and-White, Eaten All Over</HD>
<DH>New York's favorite cookie has found a home in Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK NAHMIAS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a cookie with its own cult. Called a black-and-white, it's a
6-inch-wide, cake-like cookie iced with equal amounts of thick
chocolate and vanilla frosting.</LD>
<LD>   New York bakeries, delis and grocery stores sell loads of them. In
Southern California they're harder to find, but that only seems to
make them sweeter. When a bakery sells black-and-whites, expatriate
New Yorkers flock in, just like at Dodger Stadium when the Mets are
in town.</LD>
<LD>   Mickey Jacobs, the 82-year-old owner of J&amp;T Bread Bin in the
Farmers Market, pumps out 15 dozen black-and-whites a day. The
Beverlywood Bakery has its own followers. And actor Henry Winkler has
been known to place orders for 14-inch custom birthday versions of
the cookie at Bea's Bakery in Tarzana. One employee at West
Hollywood's Dialogue Cafe insists that there are Hollywood agents who
buy them a dozen at a time and freeze them to keep clients such as
actor Paul Reubens in constant supply.</LD>
<TE>   A Santa Monica couple, professional organizer Ruth Kennison and
magazine writer David Hochman, carried their adoration even further.
Kennison, who was introduced to them as "half-moon cookies" as a
child in Boston, and Hochman, who discovered them as an adult in New
York's Grand Central Station, served them at their wedding. Together,
they're now united in their ongoing search for the ultimate cookie.</TE>
<TE>   What is it about the black-and-white?</TE>
<TE>   No one seems to know where they came from. Jacobs claims the
cookie was invented by the kitchen of Austrian Emperor Franz Josef in
1867. Perhaps. One baker at the Beverlywood claimed to know of its
origin but grumbled, "I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill
you."</TE>
<TE>   There isn't even a single standard recipe. The most frequently
printed one comes from New York icon Zabar's, but some
black-and-white aficionados find it wanting. It seems that a common
problem with black-and-whites is dryness. An impartial taste test of
a few Southern California black-and-whites was won by Bea's Bakery.
Bea's cookie was incredibly moist, just a hint drier than a pound
cake, and generously swathed in thick icing. (It is made from a
recipe from Cleveland.)</TE>
<TE>   Part of the appeal of the black-and-white is the graphic division
between chocolate and vanilla frosting. To some fans, the pleasure is
deciding where to take the first bite--a grave philosophical
quandary. Some simply divide the cookie in half and take alternate
bites from each side. Some munch straight down the center, then
sandwich the two halves together to ensure an equal mix of chocolate
and vanilla in the last bite.</TE>
<TE>   A writer named Gavin on the foodie Web site Chowhound.com says he
and his sister break the cookie in half perpendicular to the dividing
line, so each person has half the white and half the black. Together,
they then decide where to bite first, making sure each balances the
other's choice with yin-yang precision.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to eating a black-and-white cookie, Elaine, is you want
to get some black and some white in each bite," Jerry Seinfeld once
philosophized on his sitcom. "Nothing mixes better than vanilla and
chocolate. And yet, still, somehow racial harmony eludes us. If
people would only look to the cookie, all our problems would be
solved."</TE>
<TE>   As with any item that develops a following, the black-and-white
has its detractors. "Sawdust cakes" is one nickname. And there is the
prospect of commercialism. Black-and-white lovers resort to
cellophane-wrapped versions only in emergencies (cellophane throws
off the cookie's moisture balance). And under no circumstances should
one entertain the thought of eating a cellophane-wrapped
black-and-white that has a commercial label.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Hochman expressed anxiety that interest in the
black-and-white could result in its crossing over to trendiness. He
admitted worrying that his treasured cookie could become a
mass-market item, going the way of the Krispy Kreme doughnut,
diluting its multilayered symbolism.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I spent part of my childhood in Kamakura, Japan, living with my
grandmother in a house that had a traditional tearoom. Kamakura is a
town near Tokyo that dates from the 12th century and where Zen
Buddhism flourished. The monks, who drank tea to combat drowsiness
during meditation, popularized the practice of the formal tearoom,
and later they developed it into an aesthetic and philosophical
ritual that eventually evolved into the tea ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   When I was growing up, my grandmother held weekly tea ceremonies
with the ladies in the neighborhood. Always on Wednesday, these
ladies would arrive in their gray and plum kimonos, subdued earth
colors. They shuffled quietly across the tatami mat and gathered in
the tearoom for several hours where they would sip green tea and
engage in polite conversation.</LD>
<LD>   To prepare for the tea ceremony, my grandmother would start the
charcoals on the stove top in the kitchen and stand guard until the
charcoal turned red and sparks flickered. The hot charcoal was placed
in the pit in the tearoom, on top of which a large iron kettle full
of spring water was placed. Grandmother would then step outside and
pick a flower to place in the tearoom, preferably a bud, which
symbolizes a fresh beginning. She would also choose a scroll for the
wall that had the correct seasonal representation and would check
that the tools were clean and the tea powder was fresh.</LD>
<TE>   Just before the guests arrived, she would change into a kimono,
apply a little rouge to her cheeks and lips and wear a fine hair net
to hold her bun in place. She always looked beautiful. As I child, I
was amazed to see the amount of work involved for such a simple act
of sipping tea.</TE>
<TE>   I felt grown up when I joined the ladies for tea. Though my family
consumed green tea in large quantities, the experience of
participating in the formal tea ceremony was purifying and divine. I
usually joined the ladies toward the end of the ceremony when the
desserts were being served, because I did not have the discipline to
sit through the whole thing ... my feet would go to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Someone would lay a pillow on the tatami mat, and I would quietly
take my place. The lovely aroma of tea would fill the room. I could
hardly wait for my turn to sip the slightly bitter but invigorating
tea and taste the sweet bean cake. The tea master would comment on
the scroll or the flower arrangement in the vase and the ladies would
respond with equal admiration and appreciation toward the work of art
and for the human labor.</TE>
<TE>   When I returned to Japan in the '80s, my grandmother was still
holding the weekly tea ceremonies with the same group of ladies, but
the tea master had become very old and rather senile. Still, out of
respect for the master, the ladies would ask her to preside over the
tea ceremony as long as she was able. She would often forget and skip
a step, but most of the ladies (who by then had earned certificates
as tea masters themselves) would take turns reminding their master
what to do next. It was an experience that made me appreciate the
spiritual unity and the kindness of these people.</TE>
<TE>   The tea ceremony is not the only way to take tea. Because of its
complexity, and the hours required, it is probably not feasible for
general Western practice. But tea drinking can be done simply for
pleasure, digestion and sociability--without any formal ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   In the Western world, green tea is appreciated more than ever for
its medicinal properties. It is thought to possibly reduce the risks
of heart disease and cancer and even tooth decay when it is used as a
mouth rinse. It is also rich in vitamins and contains tannin, which
may help lower blood cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   My grandmother sips about six to eight cups of green tea every
day. She will turn 100 this year. Since the new year, I have been
cutting back on coffee, drinking green tea more often and taking
moments to study the twigs in my tea in hopes I will get lucky and
live nearly forever like my grandmother.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are several varieties of Japanese green tea available in
America.</LD>
<LD>   * Matcha is a bright jade-green tea that is served mostly at
formal tea ceremonies. It is made from the budding leaves of the tea
plant, dried and crushed to a fine powder in a stone mill. Matcha is
not steeped in hot water but simply added and whipped to a froth. The
taste is slightly bitter, but it is mellow on the tongue.</LD>
<LD>   To make one serving of matcha, add half a cup of boiling water to
a tea bowl. With a whisk, whip two teaspoons of tea powder into the
hot water until it becomes frothy. Serve immediately.</LD>
<TE>   * Sencha is tea of the highest quality made from the first harvest
in May. Freshly picked leaves are steamed, quickly cooled and rolled
by hand or machine. It is appreciated not so much as a thirst
quencher as for its fragrance. It has a pleasant bitter flavor and
lovely light green color.</TE>
<TE>   To make four servings of sencha, bring one cup of water to a boil,
let it stand for two minutes, then pour into a pot with two teaspoons
of tea leaves. Let it stand for one minute and then pour the tea bit
by bit from one cup to another, so everyone gets an equal amount of
tea of equal strength. Sencha that contains popped rice is called
genmai-cha. It has a robust flavor.</TE>
<TE>   * Bancha is made from mature tough tea leaves and twigs. It is
often roasted, which gives the leaves a brown color. Bancha is a good
basic tea with a toasty, non-bitter taste that suits all occasions. A
few twigs and stems at the bottom of your cup are considered
attractive and interesting. If a twig or stem is seen afloat in the
teacup in a vertical position, which is rare, it is regarded as a
sign that good luck is coming your way.</TE>
<TE>   To make four servings of bancha, put two to three tablespoons of
tea leaves into a pot. Add two cups boiling water and let the tea
steep for one minute.</TE>
<TE>   * One of the popular informal ways to drink green tea is as a soup
called ochazuke. It is made by pouring hot green tea over steamed
rice--usually the last few bites of rice left over in the rice bowl.
Ochazuke serves two purposes: to help digestion and rinse the sticky
rice bowl at the end of a meal. My grandmother often puts in an
umeboshi (pickled plum) to add flavor.</TE>
<TE>   To make ochazuke, make sencha, genmai-cha or bancha and pour the
hot tea into a bowl of rice. Bring the bowl to your lips, sip the tea
soup and guide the rice to your mouth with chopsticks. Japanese
pickles such as umeboshi complement the flavor of tea.</TE>

<LD>We loved "In This Case, the Chicken Came First" (March 27). In 1974,
we were either much behind, or way ahead, of the times. We gave our
children two "sexed" chicks at Easter.</LD>
<LD>   One turned out to be something that was white and crowed, the
other one was a Rhode Island Red, dubbed Henny Penny.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not sure anything can be a "perfect pet" but Henny Penny
certainly had a better personality than a cat. Our daughter, who
dressed all her stuffed animals, always put Henny Penny in a proper
dress before taking her out to the front lawn to greet the neighbors.
What a traffic stopper.</LD>
<TE>   Henny Penny cooperated during kindergarten through second-grade
show and tell, enjoyed two customized apartments at upgraded
locations in our backyard, rode on the Big Wheel handlebars, laid
enough eggs to share with cowboy relatives (in exchange for Santa
Maria strawberries) and finally had to accept a couple of upstarts
that were provided because she was getting old.</TE>
<TE>   On top of all that, my older son, who was quite timid with Henny
Penny, determined that the new chicks could be trained as falcons. He
and his friend would climb to the top of a couple of tall ladders
and, wearing protective garden gloves, command "Fly!" Those two were
never good pets. Finally, all three went to the feed store, where we
were assured good, adoptive parents awaited.</TE>

<TE>   I was delighted with the article about celery ("Forklore," March
20). When my mother died several years ago, I inherited a great deal
of milk and Depression glass.</TE>
<TE>   I rambled through antique stores to add to the things I inherited
and became fascinated with the number of celery jars--celery servers
with little salt dishes. I asked in every store why celery was so
important as to rate jars and special plates and no one knew.</TE>

<LD>You couldn't want more healthful ingredients for a side dish than
high-fiber brown rice and nutrient-rich Swiss chard. But if you cook
the greens with oil, you can get a fattening one.</LD>
<LD>   Here, onions, shallots and garlic are sauteed in nonfat, nonstick
cooking spray, then the chard is added and steamed. I also steam the
brown rice. There's no need to watch it and no danger of scorching.</LD>
<LD>   After tossing together the rice and chard, sprinkle each serving
with a few cashews for crunch. But use just a few--they're high in
calories and fat.</LD>

is tender, about 45 minutes.)</TE>

<LD>The world of tomatoes was on display Sunday at the Studio City
farmers market. David and Colin Irwin, who call the greenhouse in
their Silver Lake backyard Ferncroft Farms, offered 16 organic
heirloom tomato plants, including black-fruited Tula from Russia, red
Marmande from France and Amana Orange from Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Virginia Guevara of Santa Maria had an attractive
display that included picture-perfect leeks, fava beans, sugar snap
peas, tender, sweet carrots and small heads of broccoli. Mario
Trevino of Lompoc sold baby artichokes, beets, cilantro and
cauliflower the size of basketballs. From Stockton, the Zuckerman
stand brought purple and green asparagus, and rose, blue and white
potatoes in mesh bags.</LD>
<LD>   Beylik Family Farms of Fillmore had excellent Persian cucumbers,
small, thin-skinned, seedless and sweet. Reseda-based Culinary Farms
sold purple opal basil, dandelion greens, baby spinach, spicy mix,
parsley, dill and mint.</LD>
<TE>   Scarborough Farms, which grows at several locations in Ventura
County, had fabulous tiny pea shoots, arugula and bok choy, along
with radicchio, frisee and the market's only Chandler strawberries--a
bit juicier and sweeter than the prevalent Camarosas.</TE>
<TE>   For California-grown fruit, mid-April can seem like the darkness
before the dawn: Much of the citrus from the Central Valley is
getting tired and the first stone fruit is still a few weeks off. But
in north San Diego County, citrus hangs on the trees in good
condition well into the spring. So Brigido Gama of Valley Center
Orchards had fine Washington navel oranges, old-crop Valencias,
Oroblancos and Palestine Sweet limes--round yellow acidless fruits,
which people from the Mideast and Latin America squeeze for
refreshing juice.</TE>

<LD>The key to this speedy shrimp dish is the cilantro sauce--a puree of
fresh mint, cilantro and lime juice. Half the sauce becomes a
marinade for the shrimp, half is tossed with the cooked soba. Serve
this dish hot, or prepare it ahead and chill it, then tote it along
on a picnic with some crusty rolls and a bottle of Chardonnay.</LD>
<LD>   You can also use the sauce as a dip for seared scallops. Soba
noodles are found in the Asian aisle of well-stocked markets.</LD>

<LD>"Our son is getting married in a [hot-air] balloon above Lake Tahoe.
So we have been very carefully thinking about what wine to have. We
wanted something from the year he was born, 1978, but that was when
we were four years into our wine business, we had a negative cash
flow, very little money and a baby. So we're either going to take a
'78 Martini Cabernet or '78 Ridge 'York Creek' Cabernet. Part of
drinking wines is remembering the times, so I think Cabernet is a
wine that you can put down for a long time. This isn't exactly 'what
have we tasted,' but how we plan to celebrate."</LD>

<LD>DEAR SOS: When I visited a restaurant called Rustique in Aspen,
Colo., I had a delicious fennel soup. I hope you can help get me the
recipe.</LD>
<LD>   MARILYN ATHEY</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   DEAR MARILYN: The restaurant's chef, Ryan Hardy, says keep an eye
on the fennel as it cooks; if it cooks at too high a heat it will
scorch, and that will make your soup gray and bitter.</TE>
<TE>   Fennel Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   About 12 shallots, sliced</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, sliced</TE>
<TE>   Grated zest of 1 orange</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   About 3 pounds fennel bulbs, core removed, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   3 ounces brandy, Cognac, or Grand Marnier</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 quarts chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1 quart water</TE>
<TE>   Cook the shallots, garlic and orange zest in the olive oil in a
large, shallow saucepan over medium-high heat until the shallots are
lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Add the fennel, reduce the heat to medium and slowly cook the
fennel until light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Season again with
salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Add the brandy and cook, scraping up any brown bits, until the
liquid evaporates. Add the chicken stock and water. Simmer over low
heat until the liquid is reduced by half.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer the soup to a blender and puree on high speed. Strain the
soup through a mesh sieve and season to taste. The soup should be
silky smooth and rich. If you prefer a thicker soup, transfer it to a
clean saucepan and cook the soup over medium heat, reducing the
liquid further, until it reaches the desired texture.</TE>

<HD>What's the State of Oregon Pinot?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oregon is widely thought to be expert at making Pinot Noir, but so
far the evidence is not at all conclusive. The state wine industry,
though promising, is still in its infancy.</LD>
<LD>   The talk about Oregon really began with the 1985 vintage, an
unusually warm year for Oregon that produced wines with a sap and
richness not often found in that chilly location.</LD>
<LD>   On the basis of that vintage, and with California continuing to
struggle to find its way with the grape, Oregon became considered the
leader in making Pinot Noir. That is not a title that has rested
unchallenged, though.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon is not always the easiest place to grow grapes. Cool years
and a fair amount of rain create challenges for even the most skilled
growers and winemakers. But things are looking up. Starting with the
1998 vintage, the state has enjoyed a string of warmer, drier years,
and the current crop of Oregon Pinots is widely being hailed as the
best yet.</TE>
<TE>   I am not entirely convinced. While it is often claimed that Oregon
Pinot Noirs are made in the image of Burgundy, many seem to me to be
surprisingly tannic and noticeably acidic, especially in the finish.
The best wines overcome those problems primarily through a depth of
fruit that keeps the astringency and acidity at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Still--and this is my major complaint with Oregon--only a few
wineries achieve the supple, velvety texture that is the hallmark of
truly great Pinot Noir. Nevertheless, Oregon does produce a fair
number of interesting Pinot Noirs. The style may be less lush than we
find in California, but the fruit and focus are all Pinot.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind: Pinot Noir is not an easy variety to grow or to make
into great wine anywhere. As a result, the good ones, in particular,
tend to be rather pricey.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1998 Domaine Drouhin "Laurene," Oregon, $50. The Drouhin
family, famed vintners from Burgundy, established a beachhead in
Oregon in the mid-'80s and have made a series of wines that are
richer in style than many of their regional peers. This wine is a
tantalizing study of richness derived from ripe grapes and sweet oak
combined with the firm fruit acidity we expect from Oregon. With
focused black cherry and hints of violet and vanilla in the flavor
and a long finish, it has a combination of polish and depth uncommon
in Oregon wines.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Domaine Drouhin, Oregon, $36. Drouhin's regular bottling
tries for the same richness and fruit but comes up a bit short of the
"Laurene." Still, for those who find Oregon Pinots a bit too acid and
tannic, this wine offers an alternative.</TE>
<TE>   $ 2000 Erath Vineyards, Oregon, $10. This Pinot Noir is based on
respectable red cherry fruit and is light and comfortable on the
palate. It's not a match for rich roasts, but it might be nice with
lighter dishes, such as grilled salmon.</TE>
<TE>   $* 1999 Foris Vineyards Winery, Rogue River, $16. Though not quite
as complex as it might be, this affordable wine has ripe cherry fruit
with a touch of sweet vanilla and has a supple, open quality that
makes it perfect for current drinking.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Patricia Green Cellars "Estate," Yamhill County, $26. The
Green Pinot Noirs, and there is an armload of them, are very much in
the Oregon style despite lacking the gritty tannins that affect
wineries such as Archery Summit, Panther Creek and Ken Wright. In
this well-balanced wine, Green delivers a temperate mix of ripeness,
oak and firmness. There is the bit of Pinot velvet in the texture
that you expect but rarely find in Oregon bottlings and a fair dose
of ripe cherry fruit at its heart. In terms of Oregon wines, this one
is distinctly middle-of-the-road, at a middle-of-the-road price.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Hamacher, Oregon, $38. You will be hearing Eric Hamacher's
name a lot. His first wines are sturdy, age-worthy bottlings that may
be a bit extreme in their search for greater depth and extract. This
one is especially tannic and will need four to six years of aging
before it is at its best.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Torii Mor Winery "Amelia Rose Cuvee," Yamhill County, $35.
This ripe wine has notes of baked cherries and pastry crust in its
direct, richly oaked aromas. Though it finishes with fine-grained
tannins and late-arriving acids, it never loses its focus on Pinot
Noir fruit. Like Hamacher and Patricia Green, Torii Mor is a name to
remember for the future.</TE>
<TE>   ** 2000 Ken Wright Cellars "Shea Vineyard," Willamette Valley,
$46. Ken Wright is a local hero for his Pinot Noirs. He makes several
single-vineyard bottlings, all of which share sinewy construction and
a tendency to ripeness. This wine is my favorite of the batch I
tasted because deep, focused red cherry smells and engaging richness
are joined by a supple, velvety texture. Only in the finish do you
run into a toughness that would seem to indicate a need for more
cellaring.</TE>

<DH>Yixing or Gaiwan? The Right Choice Can Make Tea Sipping an
Adventure</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>C. THI NGUYEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've discovered the perfect teapot.</LD>
<LD>   But let's back up a minute: There are two methods for brewing and
drinking very fine tea in the Chinese tradition. In public, you'll
see a lot of Yixing teapots. These are one-serving affairs made of
unglazed earthenware. Some are very small--no more than a few inches
wide. They hold heat extraordinarily well, and their porous surfaces
absorb tea oils, giving brews made with an old pot quite a bit of
inherited savor.</LD>
<LD>   Yixing teapots are the primary vessel for any sort of formal
tea-drinking occasion among connoisseurs. In private, there's the
gaiwan, a small, handle-less cup set on top of a saucer and covered
with a small lid. It serves as both pot and cup. (The name means
"covered bowl.")</LD>
<TE>   Until about two months ago, I was a Yixing man. But the gaiwan is
an utterly different beast, and I've been converted.</TE>
<TE>   Yixing teapots are for perfectionists. They allow a high degree of
control over all the variables. If you know what you're doing, you
can take a leaf to exactly the place you want and produce cup after
cup of perfectly tuned tea. A cup of pot-brewed tea is clear, stable,
and static--it's something you sink into and consider.</TE>
<TE>   But the experience of drinking fine tea out of a gaiwan is
extraordinary. It is an experience of constant, intense
transformation. It  is exciting.</TE>
<TE>   The bowl in any well-made gaiwan has a delicately flared rim, so
it fits perfectly into your lips. The lid fits inside the bowl. You
put your tea leaves into the gaiwan, add hot water and cover with the
lid. The tea brews within the gaiwan, and when the time comes, you
slip the lid down a tad, opening a little gap between it and the lip.
You then sip the tea directly off of the leaves. The lid catches the
tea leaves so no strainer is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Tea develops over time. Brew a pot of very good Taiwanese high
mountain oolong in the Chinese style--lots of leaves, short steeping
time. Pour it out after two minutes, and the flavor is clear, sweet
and gentle. Pour it out after three minutes, and the flavor is deep,
dense, almost nutty. Pour it out after four minutes, and it has
developed a beautiful, high, dense bitterness that unfolds on your
tongue into the aforementioned sweetness and nuttiness.</TE>
<TE>   The problems with teapot brewing are: first, you might miss the
stage you really want; second, you only get one stage, no matter how
well you brew it; and third, if, like most of us, you brew with a
timer and never deviate from the instructions that you read in some
book, you'll only experience one stage and never get to know the
tea's development.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking from the gaiwan is entirely dynamic. You start drinking
early and keep drinking through all the stages. The tea opens up and
blooms as you hold and sip it.</TE>
<TE>   Dragonwell, a variety of Chinese green, takes to the gaiwan
beautifully. After the first minute's brewing, the flavor is faint
and sweet. Then it develops a high vegetal note and a low warm note.
A delicate sweetness enters after a minute and a half. The warm note
hardens, becoming beautifully bitter. Astringency increases.</TE>
<TE>   At two minutes, there are three powerful, vivid flavors. They
begin to meld, and, as you finish the cup in the third minute, the
flavors have become one: intense, searing middle bitterness, with a
single, gentle, grassy hum almost detached, floating high above.</TE>
<TE>   The experience is very intense, completely entrancing and entirely
unpredictable. I've had the same tea come out one time sweet and
gentle, and another time roaring and full of dense, dark, beautiful
bitterness.</TE>
<TE>   Part of this is that fine Chinese tea takes to multiple infusions.
With the gaiwan, you add more hot water when you've drunk about
two-thirds of the liquid. This means the variables are staggering.The
temperature of each re-brewing, the amount of time to drink each
cup--the leaves react differently, and, I like to think, excitably.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking from a gaiwan is rather like a difficult love affair:
joyous, intense, sometimes painful and entirely surprising.</TE>

<HD>The Perfect Tea: Where to Find It, How to Brew It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* What teas to use: Not all teas take to the gaiwan. I have had
particular luck with Dragonwell green tea and Tu Lu--a variety of
Taiwanese high mountain oolong--obtained from the Ten Ren Tea Co. in
Chinatown, though all of their teas are not of this quality. I have
also done well with Grand Keemun, obtained from Chado Tea Room in Los
Angeles. You can buy truly beautiful Dragonwell from Dat Sun Ginseng
and Tea in Westminster. It is unlike other Dragonwells--calm, quiet
and with a sweetness that fells almost like cocoa.</LD>
<LD>   My favorite local tea shop, however, is Valley Tea and Coffee, a
specialist in Taiwanese teas. The proprietor is knowledgeable and
quite willing to dig through her boxes for the freshest shipment of
whatever you desire. Valley has excellent High Mountain Oolong and a
fine Pouchong--very expansive in flavor, with wide, round, warm
vegetative flavor laid over a beautiful pure sweetness. This is my
favorite tea for the gaiwan.</LD>
<TE>   Teas that really take well to the gaiwan method--teas with
sufficient complexities to develop--are considerably more expensive
than you might expect for tea. Good quality teas cost anywhere
between $50 and $150 a pound. But tea is light stuff--even at $150 a
pound, it works out to only a dollar a cup at the most expensive. So
for less than a cup of coffee at the corner store, you can have about
10 minutes of constantly shifting, singing, throbbing flavors.</TE>
<TE>   * Where to find a gaiwan: Chado Tea Room and Ten Ren Tea shops
have some decent gaiwans, but after about a week of feverish
searching, I found only one place that sells beautiful, delicate
gaiwans: Life Style China &amp; Arts, a store in San Gabriel in the mall
at Valley Boulevard and Del Mar Avenue. Their roughest gaiwan is $10,
but the one I bought, a lovely, dragon-embossed, light little thing
of bone china, was $25 and is entirely worth the price.</TE>
<TE>   * How to brew: Different teas need different temperatures. Green
teas take about 160 degrees, and oolongs between 175 and 195. Fine
Chinese tea can be brewed repeatedly. For green teas, good water is a
necessity--use bottled water or freshly filtered water.</TE>
<TE>   The best book on green tea that I found was Helen Gustafson's "The
Green Tea User's Manual" (Clarkson Potter, $17). Gustafson was the
tea sommelier for Chez Panisse. Unlike the 20 or so other green tea
books on the market, her book is not devoted to the health benefits
of green tea or the history of the ritual in various countries, but
just to the sheer glorious drinking experience. It's the only book
that gives different, lovingly detailed brewing instructions for each
green tea varietal.</TE>

<LD>The huge baked chicken legs produced at the New York Delicatessen, a
Russian shop in West Hollywood, aren't what they appear to be.
Instead of being solid meat, they're stuffed with ground chicken and
mushrooms. Reheat them and cut into slices to make two to three
servings.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, try the deli's borscht, a bright red beet soup that
contains potatoes, shredded cabbage and carrots. For dessert, there
is cheesecake--not the familiar American-style cheesecake, but
patties of farmer cheese that contain no sugar. These are nice served
warm, with a spoonful of jam.</LD>
<LD>   Borscht, $3.99 for a 1-quart container; chicken leg stuffed with
mushrooms, $4.99 a pound. Individual cheesecakes, 99 cents each at

<LD>Once Cotes du Rhone was synonymous with cheap table wine. Not
anymore, and it's wines like this one from young Olivier Cuilleras
that are upgrading the appellation's image.</LD>
<LD>   Made from Grenache and Syrah vines that are at least 40 years old,
it has a clear, bright ruby red color and a flavor of dark cherries.
It's juicy yet firm, and very ripe without a hint of jamminess, which
makes it a terrific match with food.</LD>

<HD>FDA OKs Device to Treat Farsightedness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration has approved a new surgical device
to treat farsightedness that uses radio frequency waves, instead of a
laser, to zap the cornea into shape, Irvine-based Refractec Inc.
announced.</LD>
<LD>   Refractec said its "conductive keratoplasty," or CK, is a little
less invasive than today's laser surgery and has fewer side effects.</LD>
<LD>   In a CK treatment, heat-causing radio frequency waves pass through
a probe that doctors guide around the edge of the cornea.</LD>
<TE>   In one study, 56% of treated eyes had 20/20 vision or better
without glasses a year after surgery. But the FDA cautioned that
vision can deteriorate for at least a year after surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery will cost patients $1,500 to $2,000 per eye, about the
same as LASIK, Refractec said. Doctors can buy the CK system for
$48,500.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp., a power plant developer and energy trader, sold a
Wisconsin electricity generator to WPS Resource Corp. for $120
million.</LD>
<LD>   WPS, the owner of Wisconsin Public Service Corp., agreed to buy
Calpine's 180-megawatt De Pere Energy Center. A megawatt is enough
power to light about 1,000 typical U.S. homes.</LD>
<LD>   WPS also agreed to buy about $250 million in power from a Calpine
energy center in Wisconsin for 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   Calpine and other energy companies are trying to raise cash and
bolster their balance sheets after Enron Corp.'s collapse eroded
investor confidence in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   In Big Board trading, San Jose-based Calpine rose 89 cents to

<HD>CalPERS to Raise Health Premiums 25%</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Move would sharply increase costs for many of
the state's government workers, as well as retirees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a dramatic sign of health-insurance cost increases ahead for
employers and workers across the country, the California Public
Employees' Retirement System is expected today to approve a stunning
25% increase in health insurance premiums next year.</LD>
<LD>   The move could cause coverage disruption for tens of thousands of
Californians and sharply raise the out-of-pocket costs for many of
the state's 1.2 million government workers and their families as well
as retirees.</LD>
<LD>   The premium increase, approved Tuesday by a key panel of CalPERS,
would be the largest for the pension fund since at least the late
1980s. It was a stark acknowledgment that even a powerful buyer like
CalPERS--the nation's second-largest purchaser of health
insurance--was helpless in the face of spiraling health-care costs.</LD>
<TE>   "Looking forward to next year, it's even worse," said CalPERS'
board president, William D. Crist, noting that he expected the
panel's recommendations to be accepted by the full board today.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're going to get something better, it's our best
option."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, CalPERS' annual HMO premiums are expected to rise by $458
million next year, to $2.21 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A precise figure on how much of this increase would be borne by
workers and retirees was not available, but monthly out-of-pocket
costs to some CalPERS members would rise by more than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   This year, CalPERS' overall HMO premiums went up about 6%,
although an increase in co-pay for office visits to $10 from $5 and a
multi-tiered prescription drug plan put the actual health-care cost
increase at 13%.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, some may have a pay cut," said Perry Kenny, president
of the California State Employees Assn., referring to what's in store
for next year. The association represents 140,000 active and retired
CalPERS members.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, health insurance premiums went up by more than double
digits in the last two years, after relatively moderate increases or
flat rates in preceding years.</TE>
<TE>   At CalPERS, part of the big rate increase was seen as payback for
flat and declining premiums during the mid-1990s, when HMOs kept rate
hikes down in a mad scramble for volume. Next year's increase also
reflects rising costs driven by factors such as drug advertising, new
medical technology, and greater clout by hospital companies and
doctors groups that have boosted reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   The reality of the new health-cost environment was evident Tuesday
at CalPERS headquarters, where the fund's health panel voted 6 to 1
in favor of the changes amid a throng of disheartened government
workers and retirees.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also approved a controversial plan to eliminate two of
its four major health maintenance organizations next year.</TE>
<TE>   The removal of PacifiCare and Health Net--which cover about
350,000 CalPERS members--came despite strong opposition from
executives of those two HMOs and some government worker
representatives who voiced fears about disruptions in coverage and
the consequences of dwindling health plan choices for its members.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS officials defended the move, saying that without the
consolidation, health premiums would rise more than 30% next year.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS staff also sought to allay concerns about coverage, citing
figures that about 90% of the PacifiCare and Health Net enrollees
would be able to maintain their existing doctors through the
remaining plans--Kaiser Permanente and Blue Shield, as well as three
smaller regional HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   The consolidation of health maintenance organizations reflects a
sharp reversal of strategy from past years when CalPERS sought
multiple competing plans as a way to play them off one another.</TE>
<TE>   But given the recent acceleration in health-care costs and
significant overlap in doctors and hospitals served by HMOs, CalPERS
officials said it made more sense to align with fewer health plans,
despite the risk of relying heavily on just a couple.</TE>
<TE>   "It has never been done on quite this scale," said Dr. Mark Smith,
president of California's Healthcare Foundation in Oakland, noting
that CalPERS' success in holding down rates during much of the 1990s
was based largely on competitive health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said it remains to be seen whether this new strategy will
pay off or ultimately hurt CalPERS during negotiations, as some are
predicting.</TE>
<TE>   In recommending the consolidation and the 25% premium increase,
CalPERS staff decided against other changes in the health plan, such
as higher co-pays for doctor visits and prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   For state government employees enrolled with Blue Shield, next
year's premium increase will raise out-of-pocket costs for active
employees to $41.25 a month for single coverage, from $26.66 a month
this year, and to $107.86 a month for family coverage, up from
$69.32.</TE>
<TE>   For the almost 400,000 CalPERS' enrollees with Kaiser, basic
single coverage costs to employees would rise to $33.21, from $20.17
this year. Family coverage at Kaiser would go to $86.95, from $52.44
a month.</TE>
<TE>   Comparable figures for retirees were not available, but their rate
increases are generally much lower.</TE>

<HD>Investigators Review Global Crossing Papers</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Congressional representatives meet with former
executive to look at documents and discuss allegations.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators met with a former executive of Global
Crossing Ltd. for five hours Tuesday, going over internal company
documents and discussing allegations that the company engaged in
questionable accounting practices to help prop up its financial
statements in the year before filing the fourth-largest bankruptcy in
U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   The investigators are working for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, which last month requested a long list of documents from
the company as part of an ongoing probe into the accounting practices
and other allegations. It's the same committee that has been at the
forefront of the investigation into alleged wrongdoing at Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Two committee representatives met with Roy Olofson, former finance
vice president, and his attorneys, Brian Lysaght and Paul Murphy, at
the attorneys' offices in Santa Monica, Lysaght said.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't comment on the documents shown to us because they were
delivered to the committee under a confidentiality agreement, but I
can say that every single one of those documents supported our case
beyond our wildest dreams," Lysaght said. He called them "incredibly
incriminating."</TE>
<TE>   Lysaght said that committee representatives indicated that the
panel is leaning toward holding hearings on the matter in May, and
that Olofson will be there to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson, who was laid off by the company late last year, recently
filed a lawsuit accusing Global of defrauding the employee investment
plan through misleading financial statements. The move, Olofson
contends, prevented employees from knowing the true state of the
company, which may have caused them to redirect their investments.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Olofson cited examples of telecommunications
capacity deals that he believed had no purpose other than to pump up
a key financial figure used by lenders and others to assess the
company's health. Olofson raised the accounting issues in a letter in
August to Global's top attorney. Subsequently, many other former
employees have substantiated Olofson's claims.</TE>
<TE>   Global has not yet answered Olofson's lawsuit, but in the past,
the company has dismissed his allegations as being motivated by his
desire to get a cash settlement from the company. More recently,
company executives have softened that stance, saying that if the
accounting was misleading, it was an industrywide problem.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Tuesday, Global disclosed in a Bankruptcy Court filing
that three new directors added to the board last week would be paid
$500 an hour for working on an internal review of the fiber-optic
network operator's accounting procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The company is seeking court approval for the unusual hourly rate
for the outside directors, in addition to normal board fees of up to
$5,000 for each meeting attended. Global said the hourly fees will
not "unduly burden" the corporate coffers because each director's pay
already is capped at $100,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two months, three outside directors quit because they
couldn't devote the time to issues tied to the company's large and
complex bankruptcy case, and Global said in court papers that work on
audit, compensation and special committees "has come to a halt." The
special committee is looking into a former executive's allegations
that the company inflated revenue by failing to account properly for
certain expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The new directors--Jeremiah D. Lambert, Alice T. Kane and Myron E.
"Mike" Ullman III--agreed to join the board as long as the court
approves the hourly compensation and the "normal director
indemnification" against lawsuits and other adverse actions, court
papers state.</TE>
<TE>   The hourly rate and the annual cap didn't upset compensation
expert Graef "Bud" Crystal of Las Vegas, who usually is quick to
criticize overly generous executive pay.</TE>
<TE>   "You almost have to be a masochist to join the board of a bankrupt
company," Crystal said. "That's dirty work. This is probably heavy
lifting for these people. And there could be a big downside to their
reputations if things get worse. "</TE>
<TE>   While $500 an hour is "handsome," he said, "it's not wildly out of
line." Rates for top-level business consultants to handle
reorganization chores are running about $700 an hour, he said, and
good business lawyers are charging $600 to $700 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The three new directors, none of whom has had prior dealings with
the company or its executives, take over the committees overseeing
major issues that have plagued the company.</TE>

<HD>Area's Home Sales, Prices Keep Rising</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Continuing demand is expected to sustain
conditions for much of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The housing market across much of Southern California grew at a
blistering pace last month, achieving the strongest sales and price
gains in any March in 13 years.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County's median home price jumped 15% from a year ago
to a record $251,000, according to a report released Tuesday by
DataQuick Information Systems Inc. Sales of new and existing homes
rose 17% to 10,651, the highest level in March since 1989.</LD>
<LD>   Sales and prices also grew robustly in Orange County and other
markets as buyers across much of the region searched anxiously for
the right house. Brokers said multiple offers grew more common in
March, pushing up the cost of homes and leaving first-time buyers, in
particular, frustrated at their lack of options.</LD>
<TE>   "My agents have lots of buyers, but there are not enough houses,"
said Marty Rodriguez, who owns a Century 21 office in Glendora.
"They're selling almost as fast as they come up."</TE>
<TE>   Buyers are pushing farther into Riverside County, San Bernardino
County and other areas with lower prices, agents said.</TE>
<TE>   One shopper who would have preferred a home in Los Angeles County
ended up in Rancho Cucamonga. Dayna Shafer said homes farther inland
were larger than what she could find in her price range in Los
Angeles. She paid slightly above the $170,000 asking price for a
condominium with three bedrooms and 21/2 baths, topping three other
bidders. "I had to make some trade-offs and one of them was
location," said Shafer, 28, a chemical engineer.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, U.S. housing construction fell by nearly 8%
in March, the largest percentage decrease in two years, the U.S.
Department of Commerce reported. Despite the decline, builders still
started work at an annual pace of 1.65 million units, which is
considered robust.</TE>
<TE>   A warm winter in the East and Midwest allowed a larger amount of
housing starts than usual, siphoning construction from March,
analysts said. "Some of the strength in housing we've seen this year
was borrowed from the spring," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist
at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Vitner expects a 5% to 10% decline in homebuilding this year,
because of slightly rising mortgage rates and weaker job growth in
the U.S. economy. "It means the market is cooling off," he said of
national homebuilding, "but we're not headed for trouble."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, barring a severe change in consumer
sentiment, current conditions could be sustained through much of the
year, analysts said. Median prices, meaning half cost less and half
cost more, rose nearly 14% last month in Orange County to $332,000,
matching the previous record in December.</TE>
<TE>   March sales grew at the fastest pace in 13 years, rising 12%
during the month.</TE>
<TE>   Boosting the desire for housing in the region are a stable
economy, a constrained supply and historically low mortgage rates.
"The market will continue to be strong because those three elements
will be likely to continue in Orange and Los Angeles counties," said
Keitaro Matsuda, a senior vice president at Union Bank of California.
"I don't see any immediate danger as far as I can tell."</TE>
<TE>   An analyst at Real Estate Economics in Laguna Beach, Mark Robbins
Boud, said slower job growth in Orange and L.A. counties will cause
price gains to moderate in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   But John Karevoll, the analyst who compiled the report, sees
faster growth through summer and into fall throughout California.
"The trends are quite uniform across the board," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first three months of the year, he said, sales in L.A.
County rose to 26,636, the largest first-quarter total since 31,228
were sold in 1989. Prices, he said, also rose 16% during the period,
the best since a 25% gain in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, 11,464 homes have been sold, the highest total
since 12,035 changed hands in 1989. Moreover, prices recorded a 12%
increase during the first quarter compared to a year ago, the best
mark since 18.5% in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   There is little indication the market will lose momentum in coming
months, Karevoll said, because signs of stress on the market have
remained, so far, in check.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the number of homeowners entering the first stage of
foreclosure remains low. The percentage of buyers using adjustable
rate mortgages, which are easier to qualify for and may indicate that
consumers are stretching to afford homes, edged higher from a year
ago to the mid-20s but remain far below peak levels in the mid-60s.
And the size of an average down payment increased only by about two
percentage points to 16% in Los Angeles and 19% in Orange County from
a year earlier, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we saw any changes, any signs that the market was getting
weaker or distressed, those signs would pop up somewhere," Karevoll
said. "So far, they haven't."</TE>

<HD>Jeep Rocked by Fire, Rollover Concerns</HD>
<DH>Autos: DaimlerChrysler unit recalls 1.1 million SUVs and
acknowledges redesigning new Liberty after it flips in tests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler's Jeep unit suffered another black eye Tuesday in
announcing it is recalling 1.1 million Jeep sport utility vehicles
because of an engine problem that could result in fires.</LD>
<LD>   Jeep also said it began building its Liberty SUV at a lower height
this month, partly in response to driving tests by two auto
enthusiast magazines, one of which said it flipped over a Liberty
during a driving test.</LD>
<LD>   The moves were the latest blows to Jeep, considered the jewel of
DaimlerChrysler's American brands, which recently recalled 1.6million
SUVs over concerns they could slip into reverse gear.</LD>
<TE>   "Overall I think Jeep is in a pretty exposed position," said
George Peterson, president of AutoPacific, an automotive consulting
firm in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler will recall 2000-2002 Jeep Wranglers, 2000-2001 Jeep
Cherokees and 1999-2002 Jeep Grand Cherokees with 4.0-liter engines
"as a preventive measure--to reduce the possibility of debris
accumulation in the engine compartment that could potentially cause a
fire," the auto maker said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no accidents or injuries related to the engine
issue, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler said it determined that a design change made to the
engine manifolds modified the under-hood airflow, which could lead to
debris accumulation in the engine compartment.</TE>
<TE>   It said it would attach a shield in the manifold area to prevent
such accumulation.</TE>
<TE>   The recall notice came the same day Chrysler said it was building
the all-new Liberty SUV, introduced to the market a year ago, about
an inch lower in the front and three-quarters of an inch lower in the
rear by shortening the springs and adjusting other suspension parts,
including the shocks.</TE>
<TE>   In November, AutoWeek magazine said a Liberty rolled over during a
sharp zigzag driving test at about 40 mph. German magazine Auto Bild
said in December that its tests showed the Liberty had uncertain
handling and should be recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler maintained that both tests were too severe and did not
reflect actual driving conditions.</TE>
<TE>   But regarding the magazines' claims, "certainly that's a factor"
in re-engineering the height of the Liberty, Chrysler spokesman Rick
Deneau said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the height adjustment also was prompted by owners
seeking more "on-road refinement." The height adjustment could bring
about an improved rollover rating from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, Deneau said.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty currently rates two stars out of a possible top score
of five stars.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty went on sale last April. About 100,000 were sold last
year and nearly 35,000 in the first quarter of this year. It has been
one of the few vehicles to sell without incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler has no plans to recall the Liberty, a move criticized by
Clarence Ditlow, president of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The Liberty clearly should be recalled. It's already been
demonstrated in reporters' tests that it can tip over," Ditlow said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of time before it rolls over in the hands of
consumers. Any time you have a lowering of a vehicle in the middle of
a model year, it shows an urgent need to change it for all
consumers."</TE>
<TE>   Jeep is "at risk" given the spate of quality issues it has faced
recently, AutoPacific's Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler recalled 1.6 million Jeep Grand Cherokees in February to
fix transmissions that accidentally slipped into reverse from park,
causing a series of accidents that killed at least five people and
injured more than 150.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeep participated in the heyday of the SUV market, but they have
not kept their products as fresh or as new and that has come on to
hit them square in the face," Peterson said. "Jeep was able to
compete very successfully when there were 30 to 35 SUVs in the
market. Now there are upward of 50.</TE>
<TE>   "It really has to do with how they handle the recalls. If they do
them quickly and aggressively with a lot of goodwill attached, and if
they face up to the problem and correct it, then they'll be OK. If
they hide their head and say this isn't happening, then their
credibility going to be damaged and image going to be hurt."</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler shares rose $2.62 to $47.40 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Standoff Over Workers' Aid May Hinder Trade Measures</HD>
<DH>Jobs: If a Senate plan to overhaul a program to help
displaced employees is rejected, fast-track authority could go down
with it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For 40 years, the government has promised to throw a lifeline to U.S.
workers who lose their jobs to overseas competition.</LD>
<LD>   For 40 years, it has largely failed to follow through, say trade
advocates. Fewer than one in six workers displaced by trade receives
assistance from a federal program set up to provide them with
temporary income and occupational training.</LD>
<LD>   That unfulfilled promise has come back to haunt its supporters and
has become part of the congressional impasse over the future of the
program, called Trade Adjustment Assistance.</LD>
<TE>   The partisan fight has blocked President Bush's drive to restore
"fast-track" trade negotiating authority, one of his top legislative
priorities. It also has held up legislation to renew preferential
treatment for developing nations and South American countries that
are trying to export something besides cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   More fundamentally, some experts say, the stall has contributed to
declining political support for trade expansion and growing public
unease about the effects of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   "A quarter of a million people lost their jobs in trade-impacted
industries last year, and only 30,000 got benefits," said Howard
Rosen, a former Labor Department economist who has launched the
Coalition to Reform Trade Adjustment Assistance. "If we want to have
trade, we have to deal with the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Quezada is one consequence. He worked changing 10,000-pound
tires on massive ore-hauling trucks until Phelps Dodge Corp. shut its
Chino copper mine in southwest New Mexico in January. Most of the
mine's 600 workers were certified to receive income support and
training under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. But Quezada,
24, was ineligible because he worked for a subcontractor and
"secondary workers" like him aren't covered by TAA.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to bounce between a house payment, a car payment and
food," said Quezada, who signed up for auto mechanic training under a
different government program but fears he will have to drop out when
his unemployment insurance is exhausted. "To me, it was kind of
discriminatory."</TE>
<TE>   No Middle Ground</TE>
<TE>   A day of reckoning could come soon. Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) has promised a floor vote by Memorial Day on
legislation that packages fast-track authority and Andean trade
preferences with a significant expansion of the Trade Adjustment
Assistance program.</TE>
<TE>   If TAA goes down, Democrats warn, the other trade measures will go
down with it. The White House and House Republicans think the
Senate's TAA overhaul goes too far and want to set it aside for now.
Attempts to find middle ground have been unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over TAA reflects the breakdown of the traditional
Republican-Democrat, business-labor coalition that has helped secure
passage of trade legislation since 1962, when Congress heeded
President Kennedy's call to protect workers who lose their jobs to
trade.</TE>
<TE>   "Those injured by trade competition should not be required to bear
the full brunt of the impact," Kennedy said. "There is an obligation
to render assistance to those who suffer as a result of national
trade policy."</TE>
<TE>   The current law provides as many as 12 months of extended
unemployment benefits to workers whose jobs are eliminated because of
competition from imported goods.</TE>
<TE>   TAA checks start arriving after the six months of regular
unemployment benefits run out, and averaged $217 a week in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The program also pays for up to two years of vocational training,
remedial education or English classes, which participants must take
to keep the benefit checks coming.</TE>
<TE>   With approval of the North America Free Trade Agreement in 1993,
Congress created a separate program for workers displaced by trade
with Mexico or Canada. It includes two categories of employees not
covered under regular TAA: those who lose their jobs when companies
move U.S. factories across the border, and "secondary" employees at
firms, such as suppliers, indirectly affected by increased imports.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Labor Department approved 1,559 petitions for
assistance covering 213,609 workers. Of those, 33,800 ultimately
received benefit checks, and 31,400 of those entered training. The
department does not keep track of how many successfully complete
training or what kind of jobs they get.</TE>
<TE>   But one follow-up study indicates the attrition rate is high. In
early 1998, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. shut its manufacturing operations in
Roswell, N.M., laying off 571 workers. All were certified to receive
TAA benefits.</TE>
<TE>   According to New Mexico state officials, 374 enrolled in training
programs. Nearly three years later, only 99 had found jobs after
graduating; 45 were still taking classes, 16 had moved out of town,
and seven reported they were self-employed.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that the hourly wages of workers who did find
jobs dropped from $9 at the Levi plant to an average of $6.50 at
their new work sites.</TE>
<TE>   Experts attribute the low success rate to several causes, some of
them benign.</TE>
<TE>   Some trade-displaced workers are excluded because their employers
or unions don't petition for benefits or because they work at
secondary firms not covered by the NAFTA program.</TE>
<TE>   Of those who are certified, some find jobs on their own before
their regular unemployment benefits run out. Some drop out of the
labor force or become self-employed.</TE>
<TE>   Dealing With Red Tape</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say there is no question that for many, the program
itself is the problem. Just qualifying for benefits is time-consuming
and confusing, and local administrators sometimes are no help.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like they were just waiting for you to make a mistake so
they could take it away from you," said Joe DiCenzo, who signed up
for TAA-financed computer training after losing his machinist job at
Motor Coils Manufacturing Co. in Braddock, Pa. "It wasn't like they
were there to help you." DiCenzo, 40, quit the program after six
months to take a route sales job with a bread company.</TE>
<TE>   Some eligible workers drop out because they can't make ends meet
on $200 or so a week, particularly if they try to pick up the cost of
health insurance, which can cost $500 or more a month for family
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Some who sign up for two-year associate degree programs drop out
because the income support lasts only 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   TAA Overhaul Proposed</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats have proposed a major overhaul. Their legislation
would expand TAA to include farmers, ranchers, fishermen, suppliers
and other secondary businesses, and workers cast aside when plants
move to any country, not just Mexico or Canada. It would provide six
months of additional income support, so participants could complete
two-year training programs before the checks stop coming.</TE>
<TE>   Two provisions of the Senate bill would take TAA into new
territory. It would pick up 75% of the cost of health insurance
during training, and would provide "wage insurance" for older workers
who take new jobs at lower pay. For up to two years, the government
would make up half the difference between their old salaries and
their new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors estimate the changes would roughly double the number of
workers who qualify for TAA and triple the program's cost from about
$400 million a year to $1.2billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration and congressional Republicans are
particularly skittish about the health insurance provision, which
they see as a potential Trojan horse trotting in the direction of
universal coverage.</TE>
<TE>   But for some displaced workers, health insurance is the highest
hurdle of all.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Pat McCoy lost his job in the stockroom of
International Paper Co.'s lumber mill in Costigan, Maine. McCoy, 49,
has diabetes, high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. He
takes 34 pills a day, and his prescription expenses total $9,280 a
year. McCoy has been paying $724 a month to keep his health insurance
while he completes a master's program in gerontology at the
University of Maine. He cashed in his 401(k) account, paid a 20%
penalty and is drawing down the balance to cover his monthly
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy knows other mill workers who are in the same bind. "Some of
them are in a situation where they're making choices between food and
medicine," he said. "It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out
you're gonna be in trouble real quick."</TE>
<TE>   The impasse has been aggravated by election-year politics and the
increasingly visible rivalry between Bush and Daschle, who is seen as
a possible presidential standard-bearer for the Democrats in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Some trade advocates fear the standoff could lead to a further
fracturing of the bipartisan coalition that has kept the free-trade
bandwagon moving for most of the last 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not understand the reluctance of the administration to do
something on TAA. Politically, that could only help the president,"
said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute,
a corporate-financed think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Aid Has Limitations</TE>
<TE>   Prestowitz said Bush and other free-traders should "step up to the
plate and say, 'Hey, the winners here ought to be willing to
compensate the losers, and we'll all be better off.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if a deal is worked out, there are limits to what the
government can do. It's one thing to help displaced workers pay the
rent and keep their health coverage while they attend community
college to learn new skills. It's something else to make sure there
will be jobs for them when they are done.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that people have given enough thought to why past
programs have failed," said University of Maryland professor and
former U.S. trade official Peter Morici, who observed the
shortcomings of adjustment programs during a previous posting at the
University of Maine.</TE>
<TE>   "They take laid-off shoe workers in places like Maine and train
them to be welders and chefs, when there really aren't those kinds of
jobs in those places because the areas are so depressed," Morici
said. "What we've learned is the only good adjustment assistance
program is a robust job market."</TE>
<TE>   But Barney Ourster, a former steelworker who counsels layoff
victims in western Pennsylvania, said almost any type of training is
beneficial because it shows prospective employers that an applicant
has the ability to learn new skills. Most employers will want to do
their own on-the-job training anyway, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important, Ourster said, is the effect it has on
displaced workers.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought they were brain-dead. They thought they couldn't
compete with their own kids. And here they are, able to learn new
things," he said. "The kind of life transformation that happens to
folks who realize they still have a brain and can use it makes up for
a lot of the money loss."</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Rally Fueled by Earnings Reports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surprisingly strong corporate earnings reports and upbeat economic
data Tuesday helped spark Wall Street's biggest rally in more than a
month.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrials climbed 207.65 points, or 2.1%, to
10,301.32, bouncing back from a net loss of 178 points over the
previous six sessions.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index surged 63.01 points, or 3.6%, to
1,816.79 as beaten-down tech and telecom stocks paced a broad
advance.</LD>
<TE>   Both the Dow and Nasdaq scored their biggest one-day percentage
gains since early March. The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
rallied 25.82 points, or 2.3%, to 1,128.37--its best day since Sept.
24.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 5 to 2 on Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   After a rocky last four weeks for major market indexes amid
concerns about corporate accounting, rising oil prices and Middle
East violence, optimism rebounded thanks to robust profit reports
from blue-chip firms such as General Motors and Johnson &amp; Johnson and
upbeat outlooks from tech and telecom companies, including Texas
Instruments and Sprint.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, confidence in the economy's recovery was boosted by
economic data showing that U.S. industrial output soared last month,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But "what really set the fire was forward revenue guidance from
tech companies. It's the first good news in the sector for some
time," said Phil Dow, director of equity strategy at
Minneapolis-based brokerage RBC Dain Rauscher. "It seems like all we
had been hearing before now was that there was no earnings
visibility."</TE>
<TE>   Chip-industry companies Texas Instruments and Novellus Systems
late Monday reported first-quarter earnings and gave surprisingly
optimistic forecasts for second-quarter results. The chip industry is
considered a bellwether of the tech sector's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Novellus jumped $3.06 to $53.46 on Nasdaq on Tuesday while Texas
Instruments gained $1.66 to $33.79 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   After markets closed Tuesday, chip leader Intel said first-quarter
earnings matched analysts' estimates. The company gave a
second-quarter sales estimate range that exceeded many analysts'
expectations. Intel shares, up $1.40 to $29.51 in regular Nasdaq
trading, rose to $31 in after-hours activity.</TE>
<TE>   Dow said earnings reports expected today from firms, including
Schlumberger, Boeing and IBM, will offer more clues about the health
of U.S. business.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts expressed caution Tuesday, noting that many strong
stock rallies have quickly sputtered this year. The Dow rocketed 173
points last Wednesday, then dived 206 points Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like a snap-back from oversold conditions," said Chip
Hanlon, head of the Huntington Beach-based investment advisory firm
Unfunds. "Remember the old saying--bear market rallies are more
spectacular than bull market rallies. My advice would be, 'Don't
chase this rally.' "</TE>
<TE>   But market bulls noted that the major indexes' weakness over the
last month has masked a continuing advance in many market sectors,
particularly in smaller stocks.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, blue chips attracted fresh interest. GM helped lift
the Dow, soaring $2.95 to $64.05 after reporting first-quarter profit
sharply above analysts' forecast and raising its full-year earnings
estimate for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Among other blue chips, Johnson &amp; Johnson climbed $1.10 to $63.26
after also reporting better-than-anticipated earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola gained $1.49 to $53.88 after barely missing Wall
Street's first-quarter profit estimates but backing its full-year
earnings forecast. But Caterpillar slid $1.34 to $56.65 after
reporting first-quarter profit that fell shy of expectations,
although the firm stood by its earnings target for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Bargain hunters were out in force in the battered
telecommunications sector, where the Amex telecom index rocketed
10.2%. Still, that gain only trimmed the index's year-to-date loss to
27.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Telecom got a lift as Sprint's wireless unit Sprint PCS Group
reported a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, and Sprint FON
Group, which includes local and long-distance services, said
first-quarter earnings topped forecasts. PCS shares zoomed $2.58 to
$12.60; FON shares rose $2.79 to $16.26.</TE>
<TE>   Among other telecom names, AT&amp;T rallied $1.34 to $14.89, Nextel
Communications soared $1.48 to $5.95 and WorldCom Group jumped $1.16
to $6.23.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said "short covering" also may have fueled Tuesday's
advance in battered stocks, as investors who had bet on further price
declines scrambled to close out positions. In a short sale, a trader
borrows shares and sells them, hoping to buy them back later at a
lower price and pocket the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Treasury yields jumped as investors shifted money into
stocks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note rose to 5.19% from
5.14% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term crude oil futures prices rose 18 cents to $24.75 a
barrel. Gold slipped back below $300, easing $1.20 to $298.80 an
ounce, as commodity traders took profits.</TE>
<TE>   Other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Among tech giants, Microsoft rose $2.12 to $57.81 and Cisco
Systems added 57 cents to $15.58, bolstering Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks had a strong day. Citigroup rebounded $2.19 to
$48.11, Mellon Financial rose $1.51 to $38.62, and Goldman Sachs
surged $2.99 to $84.59.</TE>
<TE>   * Most foreign stock markets rose, with key indexes up 1.9% in
Japan, 2.1% in France, 1.9% in Germany, 1.1% in Britain and 1.1% in
Brazil.</TE>

<HD>PacBell Service Has Declined, Survey Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The quality of service at California's largest phone company has
deteriorated since Pacific Bell was acquired by Texas-based SBC
Communications Inc. in 1996, a state consumer advocacy group said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, the quality of service at the former GTE Corp.,
which was acquired by Bell Atlantic in 2000 and renamed Verizon
Communications, has improved over the last decade, according to the
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, an independent arm of the California
Public Utilities Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The group based its findings on written surveys sent last year to
more than 11,000 business and residential customers of California's
two largest phone companies.</LD>
<TE>   The study gauged subscriber opinions in 36 key service areas, from
installation and repair to billing, call quality and dealings with
phone company employees.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with a similar 1995 survey, customers of what is now SBC
PacBell gave the company lower grades in 19 of the 36 service areas,
higher grades in four categories and roughly similar grades in 13
other areas.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon customers were more divided on service quality questions,
but fewer respondents gave the company the lowest grades in 33 of the
36 categories, compared with a similar study in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   SBC officials disputed the survey's findings, saying that their
statistics show that the company is meeting or exceeding the state's
service quality requirements, and that "customer service and
performance levels have reached their highest level in years."</TE>
<TE>   ORA conducted the surveys as part of the commission's overall
review of SBC PacBell and Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   In releasing the survey results, the group highlighted the
negative results at SBC PacBell. Michael McNamara, ORA's senior
manager for telecommunications, said the Verizon and SBC PacBell
surveys amount to "a big, fat checkup" for the two companies, which
together provide basic phone service for nearly 14 million California
residents and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It is critical for the PUC and the Legislature to understand that
while SBC profits are going up, customer satisfaction is going down,"
ORA director Regina Birdsell said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "In this recent survey, consumer satisfaction continues to decline
in areas such as timeliness of installation and repairs, billing
accuracy, overall work quality and customer service."</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell spokesman John Britton called the company's service
"outstanding," and added that it has provided same-day service for
phone line installation and repairs for a year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, the percentage of dissatisfied residential
customers has fallen to 10.7%, down from 18.6% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We maintain 18.4 million [phone] lines at 99.99% reliability,"
Britton said. "All the factual markers show the incredible progress
that we've made."</TE>
<TE>   McNamara called the SBC PacBell survey result "troublesome"
because "it shows that customers have a lot more problems than they
did in 1995."</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen percent of the 881 customers who responded to the survey
reported frequent static on phone lines, up from 8%; problems with
longer installation and repair times were reported by 20% of the
customers, up from 9% in 1995; and customer dissatisfaction with SBC
PacBell's overall work increased to 39% from 17%. ORA sent more than
7,000 surveys to SBC PacBell customers.</TE>
<TE>   Britton said the survey questions were poorly constructed and that
ones dealing with call quality failed to distinguish between wired
phones, cordless phones and cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Communications promised to maintain or improve customer
service for five years after it purchased PacBell.</TE>
<TE>   "PacBell tells us that [decreased quality] is not the case, and
that the surveys they use internally say things are better," McNamara
said.</TE>
<TE>   But he downplayed the company's numbers, noting that they are
"internal corporate surveys that are unaudited."</TE>
<TE>   ORA and SBC PacBell have had tussles over service quality. In late
2000, the group filed a complaint with the PUC alleging that federal,
self-reported statistics from SBC PacBell showed that the company's
repair service quality had declined along with customer satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the PUC ruled that the company's repair service had
declined, and that it should be fined $600,000 per month if it
continues to provide poor residential repair service.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell's Britton said the company has exceeded the new goals
and has not paid any fines.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon, for the most part, got improved scores from its
customers, McNamara said.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in the 1980s and early 1990s, [Verizon, then GTE] was having
trouble with its service quality, big time," he said. The improvement
demonstrates that the company heeded the commission's mandate that it
improve service.</TE>
<TE>   ORA sent more than 4,500 surveys to Verizon customers, and nearly
500 returned them.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon spokesman Jonathan Davies said the company is generally
happy with the survey results.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty pleased with the results, because Verizon's made an
effort over the last few years to provide the best service for its
customers," he said.</TE>

<HD>Robertson Stephens on Auction Block</HD>
<DH>Banking: FleetBoston looks to sell the San Francisco
investment firm, which was dragged down by the tech bust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FleetBoston Financial Corp. said Tuesday that it will sell Robertson
Stephens Inc., a boutique San Francisco investment bank that helped
lead the boom in technology companies and has been dragged deep into
unprofitability by the sector's subsequent bust.</LD>
<LD>   Robbie, as it is known, was lead underwriter for a host of 1990s
tech public offerings, with a sideline in youth-oriented retailers
such as BeBe Stores Inc. and Charlotte Russe Holdings Inc.</LD>
<LD>   A few offerings were winners, like Mapquest.com Inc., but the
typical Robertson IPO has lost 45.6% from the offering price since
BankBoston Corp., a FleetBoston predecessor, acquired the firm in
September 1998, data from Thomson Financial show.</LD>
<TE>   Chad Gifford, who became FleetBoston's chief executive in January,
said Robertson Stephens' niche is just too narrow to be of much
benefit to FleetBoston in the coming years.</TE>
<TE>   "It is increasingly clear that advantage in the future will accrue
to the large, diversified investment banking firms," Gifford told
shareholders Tuesday at the bank's annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The Robertson Stephens acquisition was part of a 1990s
diversification spree by big U.S. banks, which now seem to be
retrenching. For example, Citigroup Inc. recently sold a major stake
in its Travelers insurance subsidiary, and Bank of America Corp. last
year shut down its auto-loan and sub-prime lending businesses, saying
they were too unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, concentrating on less risky core businesses is the aim
of Gifford. He also said Tuesday that he will trim FleetBoston's
exposure to Argentina, where the bank recently lost $1.1 billion, and
is cutting its venture capital portfolio almost in half.</TE>
<TE>   Investors hailed the announcements, bidding up FleetBoston shares
by $2.70 to $36.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   FleetBoston bought Robertson Stephens "when technology was humming
along, and for a while it got better," said Mark T. Fitzgibbon, a
bank analyst at Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners. "1999 and 2000 were
great--they were minting money."</TE>
<TE>   But when technology crashed, so did Robertson Stephens' profit.
The firm lost $61 million for FleetBoston during 2001, contrasted
with a profit of $216 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson Stephens, founded in 1978, was one of the "four
horsemen," four small San Francisco investment banks that specialized
in raising capital for the burgeoning tech industry. All were
ultimately purchased by larger firms, with San Francisco's
BankAmerica Corp. snapping up Robertson Stephens in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   NationsBank Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., meantime, had purchased
Montgomery Securities, Robertson Stephens' rival. When NationsBank
acquired BankAmerica and became Bank of America Corp., Robertson
Stephens was sold to BankBoston, which became FleetBoston Financial
after another bank mega-merger in March 1999.</TE>
<TE>   BankBoston's deal for Robertson Stephens was valued at
$800million--a $400-million payment to Bank of America and another
$400million over four years in retention bonuses and options to
Robertson Stephens employees.</TE>
<TE>   A study of Robertson Stephens done in connection with an employee
stock plan valued the firm at $700 million last July, but insiders
said the continuing problems in the tech industry have eroded that
amount by at least $100million, and probably more.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's unclear who might be a buyer. Fitzgibbon said a
foreign purchaser is most likely, because big U.S. financial firms
with an interest in the tech niche already have a presence there.</TE>
<TE>   A leading technology banker said he was surprised that Gifford had
chosen to announce a public auction, which the banker said would
accelerate an already highly noticeable series of employee departures
from Robertson Stephens. He mentioned Deutsche Bank, UBS Warburg or
HSBC, all large European financial firms, as potential bidders.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Caterpillar Inc. said low sales of heavy machinery and engines
contributed to a 51% decline in first-quarter earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Net earnings were $80 million, or 23 cents per share, missing
estimates. Sales fell 8.3% to $4.41 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Caterpillar blamed price competition and said the slow economy and
warmer-than-normal temperatures in recent months caused less capital
spending and excess electrical power. Full-year orders will be about
the same to slightly higher from orders last year, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar fell 2.3%, or $1.34 a
share, to $56.65 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Schwab Corp., the world's largest discount brokerage,
reported a 10% decline in first-quarter operating profit to $108
million, or 8 cents a share, as weak customer stock trading took its
toll.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company's revenue declined 9% to $1.2
billion.</LD>
<LD>   The results confirmed a warning Schwab issued last month and
matched analyst expectations, according to research firm Thomson
Financial/First Call. Trading revenue plunged 30% to $354 million,
and Schwab said trading levels so far this month are softer than in
March.</LD>
<TE>   "We are still not out of what has been a pretty deep negative hole
of investor sentiment," said Chief Financial Officer Christopher
Dodds.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, management fees rose 8% to $444 million.</TE>
<TE>   In Big Board trading, Schwab's shares rose 49 cents, or 4%, to
$13.07, along with the broader market.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anything in these results that justify the
stock being up today," said Justin Hughes, an analyst at Robertson
Stephens.</TE>

<HD>House Panel Rejects Limits on Auditors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday rejected proposals
to bar company auditors from providing a host of consulting and other
services for audit clients.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican-controlled panel voted along party lines to reject
proposals by Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.) that would ban auditors
from providing tax, bookkeeping, appraisal, and management services
for audit clients. The proposals also would bar auditors from
providing investment advice or legal services to such clients.</LD>
<LD>   The prohibitions would provide a "Good Housekeeping seal of
approval" to the corporate audit process, LaFalce said. Republicans
said LaFalce's restrictions go too far.</LD>
<TE>   The committee is considering a bill written by its chairman, Rep.
Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), to revamp regulation of the industry and
establish an oversight board. Democrats said limiting the services an
auditor can provide a single client will keep the audit process pure,
because auditors won't be tempted to pull their punches in an effort
to sign the client to a more lucrative consulting contract.</TE>

<HD>More Banks, Thrifts Report Rise in Earnings</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Big regional institutions join the
parade, citing strength in traditional lending businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. banks and thrifts rolled out another round of upbeat profit
reports Tuesday as big regional institutions including Wells Fargo &amp;
Co., FleetBoston Financial Corp. and Bank One Corp. reported higher
earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Solid results in traditional lending businesses such as mortgages,
credit cards and small business loans offset weakness in banks' Wall
Street operations such as investing, trading, underwriting stock and
bond issues, and advising companies on mergers and new stock
offerings.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. posted higher
earnings, but bank stocks slumped amid a general market decline as
investors worried about the outlook for banks' lending businesses
during what could be a sluggish U.S. economic recovery.</LD>
<TE>   It was a different story Tuesday. Banks joined a broad market
rally, with the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 27 bank stocks rising
1.9%.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the No. 5 U.S. banking company,
earned $1.38 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the first quarter,
compared with $1.17 billion, or 67 cents, in the year-earlier quarter
as low interest rates drove growth at its large mortgage banking arm.</TE>
<TE>   That beat Wall Street's consensus profit estimate of 78 cents,
according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Wells Fargo shares rose 51
cents to $50.10 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Including a one-time charge of $276 million for writing off
goodwill, after a recent accounting rule change, the bank reported
profit of $1.10 billion, or 64 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The results "continue to prove that our strategy for market share
growth works whether the economy is growing or in a recession," Chief
Executive Dick Kovacevich said.</TE>
<TE>   After the market closed, Washington Mutual Inc., the biggest U.S.
savings and loan, posted a 48% increase in quarterly profit and
raised its quarterly dividend a penny to 26 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle-based thrift earned $950 million, or 98 cents a share,
in the first quarter, compared with $641 million, or 76 cents, in the
year-earlier period, matching Wall Street's consensus estimate.</TE>
<TE>   FleetBoston posted first-quarter net income of $735 million, or 70
cents a share, as it forecast it would last week. Profit was up from
$142 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier, when it took $642
million in after-tax charges.</TE>
<TE>   Fleet also said it will sell its Robertson Stephens investment
bank, stop investing in Latin America and cut its investments
portfolio, to focus on less risky operations such as personal
financial services and business banking.</TE>
<TE>   FleetBoston's stock rose $2.70 to $36.18 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   At Chicago-based Bank One, profit rose to $787 million, or 67
cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $679 million, or
58 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. That beat Wall
Street's consensus estimate of 66 cents, according to First Call.</TE>
<TE>   However, CEO Jamie Dimon warned that some analysts are too
optimistic about the bank's prospects for 2003, and Bank One's shares
erased earlier gains to fall 5 cents to $41.16 in NYSE trading.</TE>
<TE>   In other bank earnings:</TE>
<TE>   * Beverly Hills-based City National Corp., parent of City National
Bank, reported first-quarter net income of $44.2 million, or 87 cents
a share, compared with $36.8 million, or 75 cents a share, a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   CEO Russell Goldsmith, citing the improving California economy,
revised his company's 2002 earnings guidance up a notch. City
National now expects profit to grow 8% to 11% this year over last. In
January the bank predicted 7% to 10% profit growth.</TE>
<TE>   * Detroit-based Comerica Inc. reported net income of $214 million,
or $1.20 a share, in the first quarter, compared with $94 million, or
50 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding charges,
Comerica's income for the 2001 first quarter was $223 million, or
$1.21 a share.</TE>
<TE>   * Oakland-based savings and loan Golden West Financial Corp.
earned $238 million, or $1.51 a share, in the first quarter, up from
$170 million, or $1.10 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. Bancorp, based in Minneapolis, earned $841.6 million, or 44
cents a share, compared with $797.3 million, or 42 cents a share, in
the year-earlier quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp earned $390 million, or 66
cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $306.2 million, or
52 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Bank of Canada Boosts Key Interest Rate</HD>
<DH>Economy: Confidence in recovery leads to first
credit-tightening move since downturn began.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA</DL>
<LD>Citing a "robust recovery," the Bank of Canada on Tuesday raised its
key short-term interest rate--the first time a major industrialized
nation has tightened credit since the global economy faltered last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The central bank said it raised its target rate for overnight
loans between commercial banks to 2.25% from a 40-year low of 2%.</LD>
<LD>   That put the rate half a point above the U.S. Federal Reserve's
main short-term rate, now 1.75%.</LD>
<TE>   Canada's economy skirted a recession last year and grew at a 2%
annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The rebound led to record job
growth in March.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an inflation threat," said Don Drummond, economist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank. He said the central bank wants to ward off a
jump in the pace of consumer price increases, though that possibility
is "still well down the road."</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of Canada said in a statement that "a robust recovery
appears to be underway" in the nation of 32 million.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's biggest banks followed the central bank by raising their
prime lending rates to 4% from 3.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Like other major central banks worldwide, the Bank of Canada
slashed rates last year to guard against a severe economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Given the surprising strength this year in the economy of the
United States--Canada's largest trading partner--analysts said the
Canadian economy has performed better than expected. That made a rate
increase inevitable, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to boost short-term
rates this year, assuming the U.S. recovery continues.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bank of Canada has taken the interest-rate lead among
major industrialized nations. The other central banks in the Group of
8 nations--the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European
Central Bank--have held off on lifting borrowing costs, taking their
cue from the Fed.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian dollar rose modestly in value against the U.S. dollar
after the rate announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian stock market, measured by the Toronto Stock
Exchange-300 index, gained 80.26 points, or 1%, to 7,841.57.</TE>
<TE>   The TSE-300 index is up 2% this year, compared with a 1.7% loss in
the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index and a 6.9% decline in the U.S.
Nasdaq composite.</TE>

<HD>Bid to Limit Citigroup Severance Deals Fails</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. Chairman Sanford Weill, who earned $30.3 million last
year, overcame a dissident shareholder move to limit executive
severance payments after the bank said the plan would hurt
recruitment.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal to require a shareholder vote for any pay for an
ousted executive that exceeds three times annual compensation
garnered 46.5% of shareholders' support, or 1.65 billion Citigroup
shares, at the annual meeting of the largest U.S. bank.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders including SEIU Master Trust, with $1.5 billion in
assets, proposed the measure after Enron Corp.'s collapse fueled
concern that executives are putting their personal interests above
shareholders. The depth of support by shareholders such as the
California Public Employees' Retirement System underlines the
importance of the issue, experts said.</LD>
<TE>   "There's never been a high-profile company where this sort of
proposal received this level of support," said Patrick McGurn,
director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholders Services
Inc., which backed the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders favoring the plan secured the highest percentage of
support for severance pay limits of any company with a market value
of $10 billion or more, according to the Investor Responsibility
Research Center in Washington. Citigroup's market value is $248
billion. CalPERS, which manages more than $150 billion in assets,
voted 27 million shares in favor of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting in New York, Weill said the provision requiring a
shareholder vote would be difficult. Citigroup will meet
shareholders' concerns by starting limits on severance packages that
follow a takeover, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never had golden parachutes," Weill said at the meeting.
"We don't believe in them."</TE>
<TE>   Weill's former co-Chairman, John Reed, took away a $30 million
package plus $5 million a year for life after he was forced out of
the bank in 2000, according to the Journal of Accountancy.</TE>

<HD>Coca-Cola Posts Big Net Loss</HD>
<DH>Beverages: Write-downs for acquisitions boost expenses. But
operating profit nearly meets analysts' estimates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coca-Cola Co., the world's largest maker of soft drinks, reported a
large loss Tuesday because of a fall in the value of some of its
acquisitions, whereas sales in North America had their largest gain
in three years.</LD>
<LD>   The first-quarter net loss of $125million, or 5 cents a share,
compares with net income of $863million, or 35 cents, a year earlier.
Write-downs for acquisitions because of an accounting change reduced
profit by 37 cents a share, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   But operating earnings, which exclude one-time items, were 37
cents a share--a penny below estimates by analysts surveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   The Atlanta-based company said North American sales were boosted
by demand for Coca-Cola Classic, Dasani water and Powerade sports
drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Doug Daft has been pressed to come up with new
beverages and ads to stem competition from No. 2 PepsiCo Inc.,
investors said. He introduced Diet Coke with lemon last year and will
roll out Vanilla Coke next month.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Coca-Cola, which also makes Minute Maid juices, rose
$1.49, or 2.8%, to $53.88 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock
has jumped 20% since the end of January, compared with a 2.4% decline
in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in the most recent quarter rose 3% to $4.08 billion, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola had a gain of 1 cent a share for the sale of brewer
Kaiser and costs of 6 cents related to investments in Latin America.
Fluctuations in overseas currencies, including the Japanese yen,
reduced earnings by 3 cents, Coca-Cola said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expected to meet analysts' earnings estimates
this year, an average $1.78 a share, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call. Coca-Cola said it would have a gain of 1 cent
from a slightly lower tax rate.</TE>
<TE>   A decline in the value of some currencies compared with the dollar
still is expected to reduce profit by 8 to 10 cents a share, Chief
Financial Officer Gary Fayard said.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast for 2002 volume sales, or amount of cases shipped,
remains an increase of 5% to 6%, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "The return to 5% volume growth is by any measure a huge success,"
said analyst Herb Achey of U.S. Trust Co., whose $75 billion in
assets include 5.3 million Coca-Cola shares.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter volume sales in Japan, Mexico, Germany and the U.S.
rose more than 5%, Coca-Cola said. The company benefited from
promotions for the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl and an early
Easter holiday.</TE>
<TE>   In North America, where the company gets about a third of revenue,
sales of colas such as Coca-Cola Classic and Diet Coke rose 3%.
Volume sales jumped 20% for Powerade, 60% for Dasani water.</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier, North American sales rose only 1% because of
competition from PepsiCo.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia to Delay 10-K Filing Again</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. said it will further delay filing its
annual 10-K financial report to continue a review of its accounting
for borrowing by company subsidiaries and firms owned by relatives of
the founder.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia, the country's sixth-largest cable operator, said it will
reevaluate its March estimate of a 12% increase in pro forma revenue
and a 13% increase in pro forma earnings for 2002. But the company
didn't expect to change fourth-quarter and full-year 2001 results
already reported.</LD>
<LD>   After the disclosure in its fourth-quarter earnings report March
27 that it had $2.3 billion in off-the-books debt, Adelphia obtained
a 15-day extension of the April 1 deadline for filing the
comprehensive 10-K financial report. The company later confirmed that
the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an informal
investigation of its borrowing agreements. Adelphia officials didn't
return calls for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia had revealed that co-borrowing by the family of its
founder, Chief Executive John J. Rigas, in conjunction with
family-controlled partnerships, could leave the company liable should
the partnerships be unable to meet the debt obligations.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ordered a congressional inquiry on
why prices charged by cable-television companies such as AT&amp;T Corp.
and Comcast Corp. climbed 7.5% in one year, faster than the rate of
inflation.</LD>
<LD>   McCain asked the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, to study why the average cable-TV bill rose to
$36.99 a month as of July 1 from $34.42 a year earlier, according to
data reported by the Federal Communications Commission. Cable rates
have climbed 43% in the last six years, said Gene Kimmelman, director
of Consumers Union's Washington office.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers have criticized rising cable-TV prices and have
encouraged satellite broadcasters such as EchoStar Communications
Corp. and telephone companies to compete with cable. Cable companies
blame rate increases on high programming costs.</LD>

<HD>Recorded Music Sales Down 5% for 2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global recorded music sales in 2001 fell 5% to $33.7 billion because
of a sluggish global economy and increased consumer piracy, the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry said. The trade
association said demand for music remains strong, but the
proliferation of free music on the Internet and mass copying of
compact discs have cut into sales.</LD>
<LD>   The federation said total unit sales fell by 6.5% and the value of
sales fell by 5%. Some analysts had predicted 2001 sales could fall
by as much as 10%. In 2000, the recording industry suffered a slight
fall in global music sales.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six major consumer electronics companies announced their support
Tuesday for a new piracy- resistant digital connector for
high-definition TV sets, DVD players and other devices.</LD>
<LD>   The long-anticipated move could bring more high-definition movies
from Hollywood studios, which have pressured the electronics industry
to add copy-protected digital connections to their gear. But it also
spells bad news for about 2.6million people who've already bought
HDTV sets, all but a handful of which have no digital inputs.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we've got a grandfathering issue that we've got to manage
very carefully," said David H. Arland, director of U.S. government
and public relations for Thomson Multimedia, maker of RCA sets.</LD>
<TE>   The new connector, called the high-definition multimedia
interface, or HDMI, is a variation on the digital video interface, or
DVI, used to link personal computers and their monitors. Built to
handle high-definition video and six channels of audio, it transmits
a vast amount of encrypted information in one direction only and thus
is virtually unusable for recording.</TE>
<TE>   The specifications for HDMI still are being developed by Silicon
Image Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chip maker, and the six
electronics companies--Thomson, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,
Sony Corp., Hitachi Ltd., Philips Electronics and Toshiba Corp.
Products with HDMI connectors aren't expected for a year or more.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those companies already have announced products with DVI,
which doesn't transmit audio. Four Hollywood studios, the cable TV
industry and the two leading satellite TV services announced their
support last July for DVI and its copy-protection technology, which
is made by Intel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Two studios--Fox Group and Universal Studios Inc.--praised HDMI on
Tuesday. Both have announced plans to release high-definition movies
on digital VHS tapes, using two layers of copy-protection technology.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Tirado, chief operating officer of Silicon Image, said HDMI
adds features sought by consumer electronics companies, which should
speed its path to the market. He also said the connector is critical
to Hollywood, which plans to restrict some of its high-definition
movies to devices with encrypted digital inputs.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Kummer, a senior vice president of satellite TV firm EchoStar
Communications Corp., said studios have proposed such a restriction
for "high-value movies," such as pay-per-view films.</TE>
<TE>   The satellite receiver would transmit high-definition signals
through digital connectors, limiting the output on analog connectors
to one-fourth the picture detail.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is, would you rather not have it at all? They
certainly have the right just not to release it," Kummer said.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of losing access to some high-definition
programming is a hot topic among many HDTV owners, who've invested
more than $4billion in their sets.</TE>

<HD>Output Showing Signs of Upswing</HD>
<DH>Economy: Increase is the third in as many months. Rising
oil prices push up inflation and threaten the economic recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The economy chugged ahead on the comeback trail with production by
U.S. industry posting the biggest gain in nearly two years. But
inflation crept higher, reflecting a worrisome spurt in oil prices, a
potential pothole for the recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that output at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities jumped 0.7% in March, after a solid
0.3% gain in February--a sign that the turnaround in the
manufacturing sector is gaining momentum. It marked the third
straight monthly increase.</LD>
<LD>   That's good news for the national economy and for America's
manufacturers, which saw hundreds of thousands of jobs evaporate
during the recession.</LD>
<TE>   Though the budding economic revival isn't causing a run-up in
consumer prices, soaring oil costs are a concern. A dramatic increase
could slow or derail the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Oil prices. That's the great wild card," said David Seiders,
chief economist for the National Assn. of Home Builders.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department's consumer price index, a closely watched
inflation gauge, rose 0.3% in March, following a 0.2% advance.
Virtually all of the pickup came from energy prices, which shot up
3.8%, the biggest increase in 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions in the Middle East were a key force behind the increase.
Oil prices retreated last week, only to flare again this week, stoked
by uncertainties in Venezuela, the world's fourth-largest oil
exporter.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, higher oil prices are a bad thing for the economy.
They represent a very real cost to the U.S. that feeds through the
whole economy," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock.</TE>
<TE>   Out-of-control energy prices would cause consumers to lose
confidence and retrench, snuff out a manufacturing comeback and send
corporate profits tumbling.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices went up 8% in March, the largest advance in six
months, reflecting higher oil costs and stronger demand. Fuel oil
prices rose 2.2%, the biggest increase since December 2000, and
natural gas prices increased 0.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Food prices rose 0.2% for the second month in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But excluding volatile energy and food prices, the "core" rate of
inflation moderated, rising just 0.1% last month, down from a 0.3%
increase. That suggested most other prices were remaining
well-controlled.</TE>
<TE>   Prices for new cars and trucks, computers and telephone charges
actually fell, providing shoppers with some bargains.</TE>
<TE>   Competitive factors, cheaply priced imports and signs that
consumers who kept buying throughout the recession don't have a lot
of pent-up demand coming out of it are restraining price increases
for some goods, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   But prices for medical care continued to go up, rising 0.4% in
March.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing prices rose 1.2%, the largest since August 1998,
reflecting the introduction of higher-priced spring and summer
clothes. But economists predict apparel prices will moderate as
seasonal items are discounted.</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Enron Plan to Retain Senior Workers</HD>
<DH>Courts: Fallen energy firm hopes payments of up to $140
million will stem defections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The judge in the Enron Corp. bankruptcy case on Tuesday approved a
bonus and severance program of up to $140 million that Enron hopes
will stem the flood of senior employees who are leaving the crippled
energy company at the rate of one every working hour.</LD>
<LD>   After a five-hour hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Judge Arthur
J. Gonzalez endorsed the plan, subject to changes that address the
objections of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Enron
creditor, employee and shareholder groups.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, about 1,700 employees would share $40 million
in retention bonuses, $7 million in severance payments and from $47.4
million to $90 million in incentive bonuses based on the amount of
cash raised from asset sales.</LD>
<TE>   Daniel P. Leff, chairman and chief executive of Enron Energy
Services Inc., testified that the bonus program is needed to preserve
"hundreds of millions, if not billions" of dollars in value that
could slip away from Enron if experienced workers aren't kept in
place while the company reorganizes.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, 35 to 40 of "the most talented employees" are walking
away from the firm each week, for an annual attrition rate of 87%,
Leff said.</TE>
<TE>   Since filing for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, Enron has lost more
than 800 workers, including layoffs and voluntary separations. That
is in addition to the 4,500 workers who were fired at the time of the
Chapter 11 filing.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC and other objectors had faulted Enron for failing to
disclose the names of those who would receive bonuses and the dollar
amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Enron management decided against naming names because of "the
significant amount of pressure," including outright harassment,
directed at workers who collected $105 million in bonuses in the
weeks before the bankruptcy filing, Leff said.</TE>
<TE>   That included a few dozen traders who split $50 million in
anticipation of the since-failed merger with Dynegy Inc. plus more
than 500 others who shared in $55 million in bonuses handed out Nov.
28. In return for the payments, both sets of workers agreed to remain
at Enron through Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Under a controversial provision of the new retention plan, the 228
workers still at Enron who received those earlier bonuses would get
legal waivers exempting them from having to give back any of that
money in the event lawsuits were filed to recover those funds. Some
critics have challenged the pre-bankruptcy bonuses as improper.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Gonzalez ordered Enron to reveal the names of anyone
receiving such waivers and the amounts in question.</TE>
<TE>   Enron agreed to include legal language providing that any employee
found guilty of wrongdoing would forfeit the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Alistaire Bambach, SEC assistant regional director for
enforcement, said the ruling was fair and satisfied the agency's
concerns.</TE>

<LD>General Motors Corp. outpaced Wall Street's expectations Tuesday in
reporting earnings of $791 million, or $1.39 a share, for the first
quarter. The company credited a greater mix of high-profit trucks and
continuing efforts to cut costs.</LD>
<LD>   GM also raised its earnings forecast for the year for the second
time in six weeks, from $3.50 to $5 a share.</LD>
<LD>   The quarterly results, on revenue of $46.3 billion, beat analysts'
consensus of $1.24 a share and far exceed what is expected from Big
Three rivals Ford Motor Co. today and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler
Group next week.</LD>
<TE>   GM got an immediate boost from Wall Street, where its shares rose
$2.95, or nearly 5%, to $64.05 on the New York Stock Exchange, its
highest price since July. The stock has risen 32% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   The results for the world's largest auto maker excluded one-time
charges and GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, which is in the
process of being acquired by EchoStar Communications Corp. Including
Hughes and charges, GM earned $228 million, or 57 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The special charges included $407million to help restructure GM's
flagging European operations, where the company is trying to cut the
number of dealers in half to about 450, and $10 million at Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the charge, it's hard to say whether Europe has improved at
all from last year," said John Casesa, Merrill Lynch's senior auto
analyst. GM Europe, which consists primarily of the Adam Opel and
Vauxhall brands, lost $125 million last quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But GM executives were upbeat about the results.</TE>
<TE>   "Strong vehicle sales in North America coupled with cost
reductions drove our profit improvements," Chief Executive Rick
Wagoner said in a statement. "The quality of our market share keeps
improving with a richer mix of more profitable vehicles and a higher
percentage of retail sales."</TE>
<TE>   GM Chairman Jack Smith added, "Momentum is on our side, and we
plan to build on our success."</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker's fortunes have been improving for two years. Last
year GM stemmed an 11-year slide in U.S. market share, and in 2000
the company posted record revenue of $183 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts credit GM's focus on reducing costs and building up its
high-margin truck lineup despite difficulties in overseas markets,
including Asia-Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, it was able to increase its mix of light trucks from
53% to 57%," analyst Casesa said, referring to the proportion of GM's
sales represented by pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and
minivans. "GM is doing now what Ford did in the 1990s--driving
earnings improvement with a richer truck mix."</TE>
<TE>   Pricing pressures, however, will remain tough, as rebates and
cheap loans continue to sap profit and Japanese importers resist
significant price increases.</TE>
<TE>   "The big driver for pricing is the competition," Chief Financial
Officer John Devine said in a conference call. "The ones we're really
worried about are the ones with yen-based cost. It's a tough
environment, and we're not going to give away volume based on someone
undercutting our prices. We have to be competitive."</TE>
<TE>   GM saw a strong showing from its finance arm, General Motors
Acceptance Corp., which earned $439 million in the first quarter, up
2% from a year earlier, thanks to an increase in earnings from
mortgage operations.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes lost $146 million, worse than last year's loss of $96
million, because of the cost of adding DirecTV satellite television
subscribers, although Hughes' revenue increased 6.5% to $2 billion.</TE>

<HD>Witness Tells of Microsoft Favor for His Testimony</HD>
<DH>Courts: AMD chief says Gates offered a product plug. He
admits he had not read settlement plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Microsoft Corp.'s first witness in its antitrust battle
against nine states said in court Tuesday that Chairman Bill Gates
convinced him to testify after suggesting Microsoft would return the
favor with a key product endorsement.</LD>
<LD>   W.J. "Jerry" Sanders III, chief executive of computer chip maker
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., also acknowledged that he hadn't
examined a proposed settlement accord between Microsoft and the
Justice Department or an alternative proposal put forward by the
District of Columbia, California and eight other holdout states
seeking tougher punishment of the software giant.</LD>
<LD>   Questioned by Howard Gutman, an attorney representing the holdout
states, Sanders said Gates characterized the states' proposal as
"crazy" and said it would fragment Microsoft's flagship Windows
operating system.</LD>
<TE>   "You agreed without knowing what you would be testifying to other
than the characterization that Mr. Gates gave you?" Gutman said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's no fragmentation in the remedies, my appearance here
is irrelevant," said Sanders, whose company is the No. 2 producer of
microprocessors behind archrival Intel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Gutman told the courtroom that Sanders asked for Microsoft to
announce support for its next-generation microchip, code-named "the
Hammer," to give Sanders' company a leg up on Intel, which was
developing a competing chip.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Gates said he would talk to his people about that?" Gutman
inquired of the Feb. 8 call by Gates to Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Sanders said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for both sides have directed much of their firepower at
attacking the motivations of witnesses, most of whom are either
rivals or partners of Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange between Sanders and Gutman, for instance, recalled
efforts by Microsoft lawyers this month to discredit industry experts
put on the stand by the states.</TE>
<TE>   But some legal experts say lawyers in the trial also will have to
address the core issue of the remedy proceedings before U.S. District
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly: How deeply did Microsoft's antitrust
conduct damage competition for computer operating systems and how
should the damage be remedied?</TE>
<TE>   The holdout states--which also include Iowa, Utah, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Kansas, Florida, Minnesota and West Virginia--want
Microsoft to produce a modular version of Windows that can be
customized by consumers and PC makers. To prevail, the states must
demonstrate that such a stripped-down product would help restore
software competition and remedy Microsoft's past anti-competitive
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "Attacking a witness' bias is not a substitute for not having a
response on the merits," said Andrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard
University. "It's a truism that parties come to the table with a
point of view."</TE>

<HD>Start-Up to Release Ultra-Portable PC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A little-known San Francisco company called OQO Inc. announced
Tuesday a "modular" computer that crams processor, memory, battery
and storage into a package the size of a paperback novel.</LD>
<LD>   When the $1,000 Ultra-Personal Computer hits stores this fall or
winter, it will operate as a wireless hand-held computer, akin to a
Palm, the company said. Or it can be used as a "modular PC" that
connects to a full-size keyboard, mouse and monitor to replace a
desktop PC.</LD>
<LD>   For now, handheld computers of its size--such as those running the
Palm and Microsoft Pocket PC operating systems--merely synchronize
with a computer's personal organization software.</LD>
<TE>   The portable OQO goes further, becoming the central computing
entity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a full Windows XP computer that fits in your pocket,"
said Colin Hunter, executive vice president of OQO. "Desktops are
pretty much dead. Most people would prefer to have a computer they
can carry around with them all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The 5-inch by 3-inch device runs Microsoft Windows XP Professional
on a Transmeta Corp. Crusoe processor, of up to 1 gigahertz. It also
bundles 256 megabytes of RAM, a 10 gigabyte hard drive, and two
wireless networking connections--using the 802.11b and Bluetooth
standards.</TE>
<TE>   A docking cable allows it to connect with an external keyboard,
mouse and monitor. It also can be networked to an existing PC or
laptop through an Ethernet cable or wireless connection. When
undocked, the device's battery life is similar to a laptop's, at
three to eight hours, depending on use.</TE>
<TE>   OQO is negotiating licensing agreements with electronics companies
who could manufacture and market the device. A version manufactured
and sold under the OQO brand is also possible, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   OQO, founded in 1999, includes engineers and designers from Apple
Computer Inc., NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, IBM Corp., the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oracle Corp. and Transmeta.</TE>
<TE>   In February, IBM announced it would license technology for a
similar device, known as the MetaPad. IBM's MetaPad won't be ready
for a few years.</TE>

<HD>Women's Pay Tops Men's as Part Timers</HD>
<DH>Work: Female employees earn a median of $1.15 for every $1
male part timers make, a reverse of the full-time wage gap, a
government study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women, long subjected to an earnings gap with men in full-time work,
take home bigger paychecks than their male counterparts in part-time
jobs, a government study found.</LD>
<LD>   Women who work part time earn a median of $1.15 for every dollar
their male counterparts make, a reverse of the 76 cents on the dollar
women earn for full-time work compared with men, according to a study
of 2000 data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers reflect the ranks of women who move from full-time to
part-time work in their careers to care for children, taking their
professional experience with them into more flexible jobs, analysts
said. Men with part-time jobs tend to be students or young adults
with less experience and earning power.</LD>
<TE>   "More women are choosing [part-time work] not out of necessity but
out of choice," said John Challenger, chief executive of
job-placement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. "Women coming into
those jobs are much higher qualified generally."</TE>
<TE>   A quarter of working women work part time, compared with 10% of
working men, the study said. And though more than half of male
part-time workers are 16 to 24 years old, a third of female part-time
workers are that young, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   There are 29.8 million part-time workers in the U.S., most citing
noneconomic reasons such as child-care and family obligations for not
working full time, the Labor Department said.</TE>
<TE>   "Women are still the primary caregivers in households, and working
part time helps them take care of children or elderly parents while
maintaining their skills, instead of leaving the work force for an
extended period of time," said Denise Venable, a Women in the Economy
Project researcher.</TE>
<TE>   The median earnings of women overall is 76 cents for every $1 for
men in the work force, according to the Labor Department. That figure
does not take into account education, age or job.</TE>

<HD>Bill to Revive Political Battle Over Net Privacy</HD>
<DH>Senate: Measure would require Web firms to get consumers'
permission to collect sensitive data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The political battle over online privacy--largely shelved after the
Sept. 11 terrorist strikes--is poised for a comeback as a key senator
prepares to introduce a bill requiring Web sites to obtain consumers'
permission before collecting sensitive information, including Social
Security numbers, financial data and medical records.</LD>
<LD>   A draft of the bill, expected to be introduced as early as
Thursday, already is mobilizing privacy advocates and business groups
that are preparing for another legislative showdown.</LD>
<LD>   It remains to be seen whether privacy--a hot-button issue 18
months ago--will be able to make it back to the front burner,
particularly with so many other issues facing Congress, including
legislation related to the collapse of Enron Corp., welfare reform
and the budget.</LD>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, many consumers expressed greater willingness to
share personal information if it would lead to improved security or
help fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups already are asserting that the privacy problem has
largely been solved through self-regulation and existing law,
including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which created new protections
for financial data.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill is a solution in search of a problem," said Joe Rubin,
lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "There is no consumer
demand for this."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin said that recent surveys by the Federal Trade Commission
show that most large Web sites already post their privacy policies
voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   And only a small fraction of consumers, about 3%, actually read
such policies, which Rubin said was another sign of consumers' lack
of interest in the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy advocates say Internet users remain keenly interested in
controlling their personal information, as witnessed by the recent
uproar over Web portal operator Yahoo Inc.'s modification of its
privacy policy to enable greater marketing of users' e-mail
addresses.</TE>
<TE>   Without new laws, consumers would continue to be vulnerable to
companies that decide to change their policies or weaken protections,
advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry has shown that it can't regulate on its own," said
Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, which is
endorsing the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is being sponsored by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Hollings has long supported tougher privacy laws, but the current
draft--dubbed the Online Personal Privacy Act--is less stringent than
his proposal of two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pulled back a bit, which has concerned some in the privacy
community," said Marc Rotenberg, director of Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Hollings sponsored a bill that would have required
Web sites to get permission before collecting or disclosing personal
information, a process known as opt-in.</TE>
<TE>   The current draft--intended to be more palatable to business
groups--requires opt-in only for data deemed sensitive, including
information about an individual's health condition, race, political
affiliation, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, Social Security
number or finances.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Hollings declined to comment on the draft before
it is formally introduced.</TE>
<TE>   Hollings already is moving to win bipartisan support by seeking
endorsements from Senate Republicans, including Conrad R. Burns of
Montana, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate supporting the bill," said a spokeswoman for Burns.</TE>
<TE>   For most other types of information, the bill is expected to
require a less onerous, "opt-out" standard, allowing consumers to
block the automatic collection and sharing of their personal data by
notifying the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The draft of the bill, dated April 4, requires all Web sites and
Internet service providers to disclose their information collection
practices; permit consumers to review information collected about
them; and notify users of any changes in policies.</TE>
<TE>   The rules would preempt state privacy laws, which would probably
upset state officials in California and Minnesota, where debates are
underway to pass tougher protections than those provided under
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Another controversial provision of the draft would permit
consumers to sue Web sites for violating their privacy and collect
$5,000 per violation if they can prove actual harm.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a very significant class-action liability," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether President Bush would support such a bill.</TE>
<TE>   During the presidential campaign, Bush expressed support for
tougher privacy rules on sensitive data, such as medical and
financial records.</TE>
<TE>   But last month, the administration backed away from health privacy
rules crafted by President Clinton that would have required written
consent before patients' medical records could be sent to medical
facilities, pharmacies or insurance companies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Delta Air Lines Inc.'s first-quarter loss widened after the Sept. 11
attacks dragged down demand and fares at the No.3 U.S. carrier.</LD>
<LD>   The loss expanded to $397million, or $3.25 a share, from $133
million, or $1.11, a year earlier, the company said. Sales fell 19%
to $3.10 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Delta's first-quarter passenger traffic, or miles flown by paying
customers, fell 8.1% as average fares slid 13%.</LD>
<TE>   Delta expects a smaller loss this quarter than in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding $25 million in costs to ground planes and train and
relocate employees, and an $18-million accounting change for stakes
in other companies, the loss was $354 million, or $2.90 a share.
Analysts expected a loss of $2.87, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>

<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson said first-quarter profit rose 18% as sales
increased for products ranging from drugs to treat anemia and
arthritis to devices used in heart procedures.</LD>
<LD>   J&amp;J posted a quarterly profit of $1.83 billion, or 59 cents per
share, a penny ahead of analysts' estimates. Sales at the New
Brunswick, N.J.-based firm rose 11% to $8.74 billion.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kraft Foods Inc. said first-quarter profit more than doubled, helped
by a drop in interest expense and a change in acquisition-related
accounting.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding costs of about $169million before taxes for a voluntary
early-retirement program that eliminated about 750 jobs and the loss
on the sale of a food factory, profit would have been $802 million,
or 46 cents a share. On that basis, results beat the 44-cent average
estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Sales fell 0.7% to $7.15 billion, hurt by the effect of foreign
currencies, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Kraft, North America's largest food company, said it remains on
track to meet full-year projections despite economic weakness in some
of its markets. The maker of Oscar Mayer meats, Post cereals and
Kraft cheese sells its products in 140 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Northfield, Ill.-based company fell 54 cents to
$39.91 on the NYSE before the earnings were released.</TE>

<LD>* Harley-Davidson Inc. reported a 30% jump in first-quarter profit as
strong sales helped it shrug off the lingering economic downturn. The
company earned $119.9 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with
$92 million, or 30 cents per share, in the year-ago period, beating
estimates. The manufacturer said it has raised its Harley-Davidson
motorcycle production target for 2002 to 261,000 units from its
previous target of 258,000 units as revenue rose 19% to $927.8
million.</LD>
<LD>   * Robert Half International Inc. said first-quarter profit
plummeted 81% to $9.1 million, or 5 cents a share, matching analysts'
reduced forecast, as demand for the company's recruiting and staffing
services remained weak. Revenue dropped 35% to $468.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   * Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Chief Financial Officer Fred
Schiff will depart, less than two weeks after the drug maker
announced sweeping organizational changes designed to get itself back
on track. Bristol-Myers said Harrison M. Bains, vice president of tax
and treasury, will serve as acting chief financial officer while the
company searches for a new finance head. The company also reaffirmed
its lowered first quarter and 2002 earnings forecast.</LD>
<TE>   * Retailer J.C. Penney Co. and cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc.

<HD>Many Electricity Bills to Shrink</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting in June, many California electricity customers are expected
to see their bills shrink slightly with the scheduled end of a
yearlong rate surcharge.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric said Tuesday that their customers would see
rates drop by about half a penny per kilowatt-hour, or nearly 4%
across all classes of business and residential customers. Southern
California Edison declined to provide specific information about its
customer rates because the Rosemead utility has not yet filed with
state regulators, but a spokesman said the rate changes should be
similar to PG&amp;E's.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based PG&amp;E was unable to estimate Tuesday how much
the average residential bill would decline, blaming the complex
residential rate structure.</LD>
<TE>   The temporary surcharge grew out of the five-member commission's
vote in March 2001 to raise electricity rates by an average of 3
cents per kilowatt-hour, the largest rate hike in state history. But
it took rate designers more than two months to craft and implement
the new rates, so the PUC allowed the utilities to back-bill
customers for the uncollected portion over 12 months to minimize rate
shock.</TE>

<HD>Tax Payments Take a Big Fall</HD>
<DH>Treasury: Brokerages estimate this to be the largest drop
in receipts since 1980. Final government figures will be released at
the end of the month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal tax receipts from individuals have plummeted this month
compared with a year ago, a drop that may force the government to
borrow more money than forecast in coming years, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said.</LD>
<LD>   The weak economy in 2001 and a dearth of taxable capital gains
last year amid Wall Street's deep bear market have depressed tax
revenue more than expected, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury receipts for the month so far are coming in at a rate 30%
below last April's level, which would be the biggest drop since 1980,
Goldman Sachs analysts said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch economists estimated that tax revenue could fall 15%
for the month overall.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence so far on net individual payments to the Treasury is
extremely poor," said John Youngdahl, a Goldman Sachs economist.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, the firm's predictions of a $100-billion federal deficit
for the current fiscal year and an $80-billion gap in 2003 probably
are too low, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House Office of Management and Budget has predicted a
$106-billion federal deficit for fiscal 2002, which ends Sept. 30,
and has since asked for additional spending for homeland security and
defense.</TE>
<TE>   A bigger deficit could boost government borrowing over the next
two years, deepening concerns among bond investors about an excess
supply of securities in an environment when interest rates are likely
to be going up, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   When market rates rise, the prices of older, lower-yielding bonds
decline. Heavier federal borrowing could put even more downward
pressure on bond prices.</TE>
<TE>   Individual cash tax payments in April 2001 accounted for about
9.5% of what the government took in all year. Many Americans who owe
taxes wait until April 15 to file returns and make payments.</TE>
<TE>   Government estimates for this month's receipts are expected by the
end of the month. A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to
comment on the brokerages' estimates and said it's too early to make
a complete assessment of tax receipts.</TE>
<TE>   A plunge in taxable capital gains in 2001 has hurt the Treasury's
receipts, experts said. Last year, mutual funds distributed $72
billion in capital gains to shareholders, the lowest amount since
1995, according to the Investment Company Institute. Of the total,
$16 billion was distributed to individuals who hold funds in taxable
accounts, compared with $99 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Federal tax refund checks to individuals totaled $126.3 billion
through last Friday, more than the government had paid out going into
the final full week of last year's tax season, records from the
Internal Revenue Service show. The average refund so far this year
was $1,954, compared with $1,740 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Taxes also were due Monday from companies that pay them on a
monthly basis. Corporate taxes paid were down about 17%, to $17.3
billion, from the same period in 2001, the government said.</TE>

<LD>The asset management unit of Deutsche Bank denied allegations that it
was pushed into voting for Hewlett-Packard Co.'s proposed $20-billion
acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp. "The decision was made by
Deutsche Asset Management's proxy committee, who exercised its
independent judgment solely in the interest of its clients,"
spokeswoman Missy DeAngelis said.</LD>
<LD>   HP revealed on Monday that the U.S. attorney's office had
subpoenaed information related to votes by Deutsche Bank and another
large shareholder, Chicago bank Northern Trust Corp., which was not
immediately available for comment and has not revealed its vote in
the merger. Deal opponent Walter Hewlett has filed a civil lawsuit
alleging that HP effectively bought Deutsche's vote by leading the
bank to believe future banking business from HP would suffer if it
voted against the merger.</LD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. closed its flagship Beverly Hills office after a
bankruptcy judge ruled the firm could break its $400,000-a-month
lease at the historic property owned by Global Crossing's own
chairman. Company founder and Chairman Gary Winnick bought the former
MCA building in 1998 through his investment firm Pacific Capital
Group for $41.5 million and then leased it to Global Crossing through
a third firm he managed. The arrangement drew scrutiny after Global
Crossing filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history on
Jan. 28.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Asia Global Crossing's debt rating was cut to the
lowest level by Standard &amp; Poor's after the fiber-optic network
operator missed paying interest on some of its debt.</LD>

<LD>Spiderdance Inc. of Venice, which makes software for interactive
television, announced that it's suspending operations in the face of
weak demand from TV producers and networks. "The problem is that
investment follows revenues, and the revenues just aren't here yet,"
said Steven Hoffman, the company's chief executive. "In a bad
advertising market, it's an impossible sell." Spiderdance had already
whittled its staff down to 11 from a high of 44. Its four founders
hope to revive the company when demand for interactive TV technology
grows.</LD>

staff after first-quarter sales plummeted 81%. The job cuts will
reduce Commerce One's work force to about 1,100. Commerce One had a
loss of $220.6 million, or 77 cents a share, in the quarter ended
March 31, compared with a loss of $228.5 million, or $1.02, a year
earlier. Sales plunged to $31.8 million from $170.3 million.</LD>

<HD>Intel's Earnings Point to a Turnaround</HD>
<DH>Technology: The slight drop posted by the No. 1 chip maker
suggests that its profit declines may be nearing an end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. reported Tuesday that first-quarter earnings fell
slightly from a year ago, suggesting that its profit declines are
nearing an end. The world's largest chip maker also forecast a wide
second-quarter revenue range of $6.4billion to $7billion.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel said net income before
acquisition-related charges was $1billion, or 15 cents a share,
compared with year-ago profit before charges of $1.1billion, or 16
cents a share. Revenue rose to $6.8billion from $6.68billion.</LD>
<LD>   On that basis, the results were in line with the 15 cents a share
analysts polled by research firm Thomson Financial/First Call had
forecast. Estimates ranged from 13 cents to 16 cents a share and
revenue was forecast at $6.79billion.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts had forecast second-quarter earnings of 15 cents a share,
within a range of 11 cents to 18 cents, on revenue of $6.67billion, a
decline of about 1.8% from first-quarter levels.</TE>
<TE>   Intel announced Monday a legal settlement with Intergraph Corp.,
bringing to a close a long-running legal battle. That settlement
resulted in a charge to the first quarter of $155million, which
reduced per-share results before acquisition-related charges of 14
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said that the first
quarter was a seasonal one, following a seasonal fourth quarter. That
seasonality is still intact, albeit based on lower economic levels
because of the slowing U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   Intel shares rose $1.40 to $29.51 before the results were released
after the close of regular Nasdaq trading. In after-hours trading,
Intel shares rose to $31.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings reports Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Motorola Inc.'s first-quarter loss narrowed to $449million on
lower expenses as revenue dropped 22% at the world's second-largest
mobile-phone maker. The loss, the company's fifth straight, was 20
cents a share, compared with $533million, or 24 cents, a year
earlier. Sales declined to $6.02billion, the lowest in seven years,
from $7.68billion.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola Chief Executive Christopher Galvin repeated his
prediction that the company will be profitable, excluding severance
and other costs, in the second half by increasing sales and reducing
costs. Some investors said he may have the elements in place for a
rebound, such as new phones and able deputies. Last year, Galvin
misjudged demand for handsets and semiconductors.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding exited businesses and severance, acquisitions and
investment loss costs, the company said its loss would have been
$174million, or 8 cents a share, compared with $211million, or 10
cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   On that basis, the results don't conform to generally accepted
accounting principles.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expected a loss of 12 cents a share on revenue of
$6.07billion, the average estimates from a Thomson Financial/First
Call poll. In January, the firm forecast a loss of 11 cents to 14
cents a share on sales of $6billion to $6.1billion. Shares of
Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola rose as much as 35 cents to $15.35 in
after-hours trading following the report. They rose $1.34 to $15 on
the New York Stock Exchange and have climbed 9.1% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   * RealNetworks Inc. posted a quarterly net profit for the first
time in more than two years as the Internet media software and
services pioneer built momentum behind its consumer subscription
business. RealNetworks, known for its RealOne software for playing
audio and video over the Internet, said its first-quarter net profit
was just more than $1million, or 1 cent a share, compared with a loss
of $24.4million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   That was in line with the consensus Wall Street estimate of 1 cent
a share as reported by earnings tracking firm Thomson Financial/First
Call. It was the first time since the fourth quarter of 1999 that
Real has posted a net profit. Acquisitions forced it to recognize
charges and post a series of net losses, though excluding those costs
the company was profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding more than $2.6million in expenses like non-cash losses
in a joint venture and amortization of stock compensation, Real said
adjusted cash earnings were nearly $3.7million, or 2 cents per share.
Revenue at the Seattle-based company was $47.3million, down from
$50.4million a year earlier and within the range of $46million and
$48.5million expected by analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Real rose 44 cents, or 6.5%, to $7.24 on Nasdaq. The
stock held near that level in after-hours trading after the earnings
report was released.</TE>
<TE>   * Vitesse Semiconductor Corp.'s fiscal second-quarter loss widened
as the communications chip maker's sales declined 65%. The loss for
the quarter ended March 31 widened to $44.4million, or 22 cents a
share, from $11.2million, or 6 cents, in the year-earlier period.
Sales fell to $42.1million from $121.8million.</TE>
<TE>   The Camarillo company's revenue has dropped from the year-earlier
period for four straight quarters. Vitesse closed up 90 cents at
$9.01 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Analysts Warn REIT Stock Prices May Have Risen Too High</HD>
<DH>Real estate: In the latest downgrade, Prudential Securities
cuts ratings on three to 'hold.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hefty dividend yields and steady profit growth have lured more
investors to real estate investment trusts this year, and some
analysts are growing concerned the stocks have climbed too far.</LD>
<LD>   Prudential Securities Inc.'s James Sullivan on Tuesday cut ratings
on Kilroy Realty Corp., SL Green Realty Corp. and Equity Office
Properties Trust, citing rising office vacancy rates in some markets.</LD>
<LD>   He joined other analysts who have downgraded REIT stocks in recent
months and warned that the stocks are expensive after their sharp
gains of the last two years.</LD>
<TE>   The analysts' arguments seem compelling to Wendell Perkins of
Johnson Asset Management in Racine, Wis., who Tuesday sold shares of
Camden Property Trust and Weingarten Realty Investors.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning we started cutting our exposure to the whole
sector," Perkins said. When he added the stocks to the $80-million
JohnsonFamily Small Cap Value Fund a few years ago, "They were very
cheap," Perkins said. "They're just not any longer."</TE>
<TE>   A Bloomberg index of 148 REIT shares has surged 35% since year-end
1999, including a gain of 9% so far this year. Those returns don't
include dividends paid.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has fallen
23% since year-end 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Kilroy shares (ticker symbol: KRC) fell 73 cents to $28.26 on
Tuesday, while SL Green (SLG) lost 83 cents to $24.77 and Equity
Office (EOP) slid 47 cents to $30.61.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential's Sullivan lowered Kilroy, SL Green and Equity Office
to "hold" from "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Kilroy's share price still is up 8% this year, SL Green is up 13%
and Equity Office is up 2%.</TE>
<TE>   REITs own buildings and essentially pass the rents through to
shareholders in the form of dividends. REITs may specialize in
commercial, residential or industrial properties, or own a mix of all
three sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in an uncertain stock market like we've been in for
the last couple of years, the REITs are safe havens," said
JohnsonFamily's Perkins. Multiyear leases give many REITs relatively
stable, predictable earnings, and the dividends can make the stocks
attractive even when they aren't gaining. Annualized yields on many
REITs are above 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said REITs will be less attractive if other parts of the
stock market take off as the economy recovers. Even so, he said, "the
relative attractiveness of their yields is going to continue to be a
positive factor."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Steve Sakwa said in a research note
this week that REITs are, on average, offering a 6.2% dividend yield,
down from 7% at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that they are trading at almost an 8% premium to
their net asset value, a method commonly used to assess whether they
are cheap or expensive.</TE>

<DL>SOUTHEAST UTAH</DL>
<LD>We are in the canyon lands a few miles from nowhere, and we are being
stalked. Two people tailing us in their SUV want money. They are
bandits with badges. They are government workers. They are land
developers.</LD>
<LD>   Pardner, welcome to the death of the West, again, and this time
maybe for good.</LD>
<LD>   Freedom? The wild? A campfire under the stars? A chance to get
away from things and show the kids what remains of our greatest myth?</LD>
<TE>   Times are changing and not for the good on our public lands.
Another important revolution in the history of the wide-open West is
unfolding across tens of thousands of acres controlled by the U.S.
Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Signs are going up. Fee
boxes are going in. Rangers and their sidekicks, those once-kindly
volunteer campsite docents, have been given a new mission. Make way
for the bulldozers and cement mixers and construction workers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are asking for fees I don't want to pay to build things that
I don't want to see," groans my guide, David Petersen, as we bounce
down a four-wheel-drive road across a bone-dry mesa of slickrock and
juniper in some of the toughest and least-traveled country in the
Southwest. "They are charging us to Disneyfy our public lands."</TE>
<TE>   For a while now, a few farsighted people have been sounding the
alarm about the federal government's six-year-old experiment to
impose fees on public land users. They warned that development and
concessions and ruination of peace and quiet would follow. They were
correct, of course, and a grass-roots uprising is fast gaining steam
in states from Utah to Oregon, from Montana to Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   This is not one of your effete fights between Sierra Club
backpackers and everyone else. This is a showdown that will define
public lands for all stripes of users, from hunters and bird-watchers
to mountain bikers and old-boy pickup-truck campers like Petersen and
me.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really bringing bureaucracy to the people with this one,"
says Petersen. "I'm not sure that grass-roots is organic enough to
describe what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   June 15 has been set for a national protest against this
commercialization of our public trust lands, specifically against
Bush administration plans to make permanent this development, or
"recreation," fee program. Petersen, a mountain man, a canyon man and
a writer with one of the West's most distinctive voices on behalf of
wildness, has brought me to Cedar Mesa to peek into the future. There
are no rivers here, no lakes, no towering trees, just rutted jeep
trails and a few hundred miles of hard-angled Southwest rock scenery.
This is one of those places where people come when they are serious
about getting away, to command one's own horizon for a day or two.</TE>
<TE>   But no more. Sturdy new "Fee Area" signs are posted every few
miles--signs that beckon people to come, signs that foreshadow paved
roads and asphalt campgrounds and maybe a curio shop. Who knows what
the traffic will bear?</TE>
<TE>   All across this region and elsewhere in the West, the rough is
being scraped away from what is left of our public lands. Not far
from here is Sand Island, the storied put-in for rafters on the San
Juan River. What do rafters need? A place to blow up their boats and
camp one night before beginning their float. What is the government
providing them? Thanks to fees, they now have an absurd concrete
launch ramp.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to adventure. Don't worry about getting your feet muddy.
And please enjoy the new showpiece visitor center and maintenance
building and ranger station and the field of solar panels to keep the
cash registers running.</TE>
<TE>   This magical place of cottonwoods and sweet memories for a
generation of outdoor lovers now resembles nothing so much as a strip
mall.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't we do this already to our national parks, and to our
lasting regret?</TE>
<TE>   Like army ants, federal land managers cannot leave the land to
manage itself for the pleasure of us to enjoy. If there are no more
trees to cut, no petroleum to drill for, no cattle to graze, then
there must be buildings, turnarounds, fences, entrepreneurial
opportunities and, of course, deputies to maintain a show of force.
Bureaucrats are turning what remains of the land into another kind of
jobs program for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Behind us this day, the BLM rangers eat our dust for miles in case
we venture across the invisible boundary into their "fee area,"
perhaps taking a day hike down one of the labyrinth canyons. We
disappoint them. But they have made their point: The wide-open spaces
are being closed, and fast.</TE>
<TE>   On June 15, I'll be joining the protesters. Take those road crews
and fix our crumbling freeways. Send the construction workers to
rebuild city schools. Let a couple of guys in a pickup truck park
under the stars without mercury-vapor lights to lead the way to a
brand-new hot-water shower and Laundromat strip-mall facility. Sign
in and deposit money here.</TE>

<HD>Osama bin Laden No Longer Exists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Osama bin Laden is dead or deformed badly by shrapnel or so ill that
he can't talk or show himself. No, I have not had the privilege of
administering him his last rites or seen him buried or had a CIA
agent whisper this information into my ear.</LD>
<LD>   However, because common sense is permitted in the court of public
opinion, allow me to plead my case: When I saw the excerpts from the
so-called "new" Bin Laden tape broadcast Monday, I knew that Bin
Laden didn't exist anymore. This was a desperate move to somehow fuel
the hopes of his disciples that their leader is still alive.</LD>
<LD>   One portion of the tape likely shows a pre-December Bin Laden. His
beard in the latest tape is darker than it was in a late December
tape, and his skin looks much healthier. The grass is too green to
represent a post-icy winter growth.</LD>
<TE>   The fact that no one tried to camouflage or hide the background
indicates that the people who sent the tape to the Al Jazeera TV
station knew that the rocks and the mountains could disclose the
location, but it did not matter anymore.</TE>
<TE>   If Bin Laden were alive and well, we would have seen an up-to-date
video that included a current newspaper or magazine to confirm the
date.</TE>
<TE>   So why did Bin Laden's friends create this charade?</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, you cannot be a Middle East Islamic leader without
pounding on your chest in a nonstop public fashion, reminding the
masses that you are there to lead them.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, when the first World Trade Center tower was struck,
Bin Laden became the closest thing to an Islamic god to
fundamentalist Muslims worldwide. He understood immediately the
instant leadership options that were created for him through his
murderous success. The world saw the video in which Bin Laden
admitted with glee to a close-knit circle that even he had not
realized how big the disaster would be.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden, the instant Islamic mini-god, then paraded around
Afghanistan and its training camps, accumulating more and more
disciples. He felt safe among the Taliban, which had beaten the
Soviets, and he felt admired, loved and protected by his followers.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden had all the reasons to believe that he was the new
Saladin, the 12th century Arab hero (who was really a Kurd) who won
the decisive victory against the Christian Crusaders.</TE>
<TE>   There is a tradition in the Middle East in which the leader
impresses the masses with constant public appearances, sword-waving
and colorful oratory. He impresses his audience, gains its admiration
for his showmanship and in return is told that he's indeed the chosen
one.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden didn't show his face to the world for the last 41/2
months. Only Soviet leaders could afford that disconnect from their
public, but that's a very long time for the Middle East. No Arab
leader, living in an area that is so assassination-prone, can be
absent that long without raising suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Not making an appearance in person or at least sending another
tape to a friendly TV station is tantamount to nonexistence,
especially when you have to compete, nowadays, with dramatic
personalities such as Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden, indeed, no longer exists.</TE>

<HD>The Three Islamic Faces of Suicide Bombing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMIR TAHERI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does Islam promote suicide bombing? Three answers seem to be
circulating in the Muslim world.</LD>
<LD>   The first could be described as "yes-yes." It comes from the
groups that recruit and use suicide bombers. Their argument is:
Because we regard Israel as evil, we not only have a right but also a
duty to fight it even in ways that are otherwise evil.</LD>
<LD>   The second answer came from the meeting of the foreign ministers
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Malaysia this month.
That answer could be described as "yes-but." The ministers in effect
approved of suicide bombing provided it was not used against their
own governments. As for the definition of terrorism--the purpose of
the gathering--they said that was a job for the United Nations. This
was interesting because some participants also claimed that the U.N.
was a mere tool of the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The third answer could be described as "no-but" and came from
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Since suicide is forbidden
in Islam, the argument goes, we cannot sanction such acts. At the
same time we cannot condemn people who, driven to desperation, use
such methods.</TE>
<TE>   All three answers are problematic. It is disingenuous to claim
that suicide bombers are ordinary youths who suddenly decide to
sacrifice their lives to kill some of the "enemy." Organizing and
implementing a suicide attack is a complex operation that requires
recruitment, training, finance, logistics, surveillance and
postoperation publicity. An 18-year-old girl may fancy herself as a
suicide bomber but, alone, would not be able to organize an
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide bombing must, therefore, be regarded as a deliberate act,
decided, organized and promoted by politicians as part of a strategy.
This is clear from statements by Palestinian leaders who say they
ordered a halt to such attacks to encourage changes in Israeli
behavior. When the changes did not happen, suicide bombings resumed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Islam forbids suicide--without any ifs and buts. Life belongs
to he who grants it, not to mortal men who are its trustee. To
violate that rule amounts to a claim of divine authority for mortal
man.</TE>
<TE>   The issue becomes more complicated when would-be suicide bombers
are presented as martyrs. In Islam, a martyr is either one who
suffers at the hands of the enemies of Islam, often to the point of
death, because of faith--not politics--or someone who falls in a
battle against aggressors. The martyr does not want to become one. He
knows that the highest value is the preservation of life; he is put
to death not by his own hands but by his oppressors.</TE>
<TE>   Islam celebrates life and promotes its enjoyment. There is no cult
of martyrs and saints in Islam. There also are no hermits, nuns,
celibates and no acquiring of merit through self-torture. Islam
teaches man how to live, not how to die. "The ends justify the means"
has no place in Islamic ethics or philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   Islam as an existential reality is something else. There are
politicians who glorify suicide bombing. How representative are they?
We will never know until there is an atmosphere in which opinions are
aired without fear and without taqiyyah, or dissimulation.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide bombing also is problematic on ethical grounds. Can we
condone any suicide bombing, including the Sept. 11 attacks in New
York and at the Pentagon? And what about suicide bombings conducted
by opposition groups in Iran and Iraq? If not, who decides which
suicide bombing is good and which bad? Can anyone decide to become a
martyr? If not, who distributes martyrdom certificates?</TE>
<TE>   In any society the state on the basis of law must decide about
life and death. Even war has laws. This is why there can be no
revenge killing by individuals, no lynch mobs and no suicide in the
service of any cause. And Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat has condemned suicide bombings, at least when speaking in
English.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to make heroic statements about Palestinians from a
distance, as long as only the Palestinians and the Israelis pay with
blood.</TE>
<TE>   The key ethical questions for Muslims are these: Are you prepared
to practice what you preach? Can you become a suicide bomber? Are you
prepared to urge your offspring to become human bombs?</TE>
<TE>   Ethics can explain, even understand, evil, but can never justify
it, let alone confuse it with good.</TE>

<HD>Ramiro de Leon Carpio, 60; Former Guatemala Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GUATEMALA CITY</DL>
<LD>Former Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio was found dead
Tuesday in a Miami apartment, family members said. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was unknown, but a son, Jorge Eduardo de Leon,
said his father may have suffered a diabetic coma. The son said his
father had trouble regulating his blood sugar in recent days.</LD>
<LD>   President Alfonso Portillo announced three days of mourning for De
Leon Carpio. "He was a brave and simple man who identified with the
fight for human rights, the right of law and liberty," the president
said.</LD>
<TE>   A former human rights ombudsman, De Leon Carpio was named
president in 1993 when Jorge Serrano was forced to flee the country
after a failed attempt to dismiss Congress and the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   De Leon Carpio eventually called general elections, then handed
power to President Alvaro Arzu on Jan. 14, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   De Leon Carpio also served as president of the Congress that
drafted the country's 1984 constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he announced that he was leaving the ruling Guatemalan
Republican Front party because he was concerned about allegations of
corruption in the government.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot continue supporting with my presence a style of
government that I do not share," he said in making the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Guatemala City, De Leon Carpio taught political and social
sciences at Rafael Landivar University.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the country's ministry of economy in the 1960s and
'70s.</TE>
<TE>   He was the co-founder of Guatemala's National Center Party in 1983
and served as secretary general of the party from 1983-86.</TE>
<TE>   De Leon Carpio is survived by his wife, Eugenia de Leon, and three
sons. Jorge Eduardo and Alejandro live in Guatemala, while
Ramiro--who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 1984 in
Guatemala--resides in Houston. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Elisabeth Reed Wagner, 21, who had battled tumors since she was a
toddler and whose positive attitude was immortalized by country
singer Billy Gilman in the song "Elisabeth" on his "Dare to Dream"
album, died Thursday of cancer in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   Wagner had neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes small
and mostly benign tumors to form on nerves, since she was 2.</LD>
<LD>   She enrolled in Texas A&amp;M University in 1998 to earn a degree in
elementary education but had to drop out last year when the disorder
progressed to cancer.</LD>
<TE>   The song "Elisabeth" was written by Wagner's aunt, Liz Rose, and
her friend, Kim Patton Johnston.</TE>
<TE>   Rose, who was inspired by her niece's positive attitude toward her
disease, wrote the song in about an hour:</TE>
<TE>   "Elisabeth, you make the world a better place/With the kindness of
your smile and your love/And your beauty will live on and on."</TE>

<HD>Ruth Fertel, 75; Founder of Worldwide Steakhouse Chain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruth Fertel, who was a divorced mother with no business experience
when she found the gumption to buy a restaurant and then watched it
expand into the worldwide chain of Ruth's Chris Steak Houses, died in
New Orleans on Tuesday. She was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Fertel, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2000 but
remained active until she was hospitalized Friday, said William Hyde
Jr., president and chief executive of the company.</LD>
<LD>   "She was a very classy example of the American dream," said former
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, a frequent diner at Fertel's
restaurants. "She was also someone that every politician in this
state knew and respected."</LD>
<TE>   The original Ruth's, founded in New Orleans in 1965, became a
favorite gathering place for politicians, sports figures, businessmen
and media personalities. The recipe was simple: Buy the best corn-fed
beef she could find, hand-cut every piece, sear it at 1,800 degrees
and serve it in a comfortable atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Fertel admitted that her chain was an unlikely success story. The
daughter of a hard-driving insurance man and a kindergarten teacher,
she was born in New Orleans in 1927. She earned a degree in chemistry
at Louisiana State University at age 19, taught college briefly,
married and started a family. After 14 years at home, she reentered
the work force as a laboratory technician at Tulane Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   When her marriage ended, she feared that she would not earn enough
to send her two teenage sons to college. So she scoured the
classified ads and in 1965 happened on an offer to buy a restaurant
that listed a phone number but not the eatery's name. Curious, she
flipped through the yellow pages until she matched the number to the
Chris Steak House.</TE>
<TE>   Although she had no experience running a restaurant, Fertel
mortgaged her home to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a case of blind ambition, but I thought I could run a
steakhouse," she told a restaurant trade magazine in 1997. "At least
it sounded more interesting than running a bar."</TE>
<TE>   She was so naive that she planned only to borrow the $18,000
needed to make the purchase, "but the bank suggested I take an
additional $4,000 to buy food and supplies," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The original owner had promised to train her, but instead emptied
the cash register and disappeared as soon as the sale was completed.
"He didn't teach me beans," Fertel told the San Antonio Express News
a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The only advice that he gave her was to never cut steaks with an
electric saw. She followed it for a week, until she so tired of
slicing 30-pound short loins with a handsaw that she switched. She
bought an electric saw and never looked back.</TE>
<TE>   She kept the original name of the steakhouse until 1976, when a
fire burned down the building and she had to relocate. A clause in
the purchase agreement stipulated that if she ever left the original
site she would have to alter the name. So she tacked on her first
name, producing the tongue-twisting but memorable Ruth's Chris Steak
House.</TE>
<TE>   That same year she sold her first franchise--to a Baton Rouge
customer tired of the 90-mile drive to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Now the chain has 36 company-owned restaurants and 46 franchised
locations in the United States, Hong Kong, Canada, Mexico, Puerto
Rico and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I open a new restaurant I say to myself, 'Here's this
little ol' country girl from Port Sulphur, La., with all these
upscale steakhouses with her name on them,'" said the throaty Fertel,
who often wore outfits that matched the red-and-black theme of her
restaurants. "It completely astounds me."</TE>
<TE>   According to the company's latest figures, the restaurants sell
about 14,000 steaks daily and grossed more than $320 million in 2001.
Since 1999, majority control in the company has been held by
Chicago-based Madison Dearborn Partners. Fertel and her family
remained minority partners.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Fertel and a friend spent more than $500,000 to build a
mausoleum at Lake Lawn Metairie Cemetery, and she unveiled it with a
party that was remarkable even by New Orleans standards. At the time,
one guest described the deep-burgundy facade as being as richly
marbled as a Ruth's Chris steak.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</TE>

<HD>F. Tovey, 46; Musician Used Name 'Fad Gadget'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Tovey, who under the moniker Fad Gadget created innovative
electronic music in England, has died. He was 46.</LD>
<LD>   Tovey died April 3 at his home in London after a lifelong battle
with heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   Born in London's East End, Tovey was influenced as a youth by the
music of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed.</LD>
<TE>   He put together his first band as a teenager, but developed a more
radical musical approach when he attended St. Martin's School of Art
in 1974. He also studied performance art at Leeds Polytechnic.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating, Tovey returned to London and began making music
using a variety of conventional and unconventional sources, including
drum machines, electronic pianos and items found in the kitchen
cupboard.</TE>
<TE>   About 1978, he developed the guise of Fad Gadget and over the next
several years created four albums for the independent label Mute.</TE>
<TE>   Tovey's music helped influence the sounds of several up-and-coming
bands, including Depeche Mode, and his early techno work was viewed
as influential to the techno/dance bands of the '90s. His songs were
armed with social commentary and black humor.</TE>
<TE>   In concert, Tovey gave Fad Gadget an intense persona, and often
came away battered and bruised for the experience.</TE>
<TE>   At one concert, he cut his nose and blackened both eyes when he
swung a microphone around his neck and it hit him in the face. He
ended up with both of his legs in casts after he jumped off the
stage.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Tovey dropped the Fad Gadget persona and began
recording for Mute under his own name and playing acoustic
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, Tovey pulled on the Fad Gadget guise again,
appearing in shows around Britain and Europe supporting Depeche Mode.</TE>

<HD>Robert Urich, 55; Popular Star of 'Vega$' and 'Spenser'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Urich, the personable actor best known for his tough-guy TV
roles as Las Vegas private detective Dan Tana on "Vega$" and as
Robert Parker's sophisticated Boston private investigator in
"Spenser: For Hire," died Tuesday morning of cancer. He was 55.</LD>
<LD>   Urich, whose career spanned 30 years, died at the Los Robles
Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, said his publicist, Cindy
Guagenti. His wife of 28 years, actress Heather Menzies, and his
three children were with him at the time.</LD>
<LD>   Six years ago, Urich was diagnosed with synovial cell sarcoma, a
rare form of cancer that attacks the joints. The cancer was
discovered in his groin, and had gone into remission after
chemotherapy, radiation treatment and two surgeries.</LD>
<TE>   Urich told Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd in November that
more lumps had been found over the summer, but that a "wonder drug"
had cleared up the recurrence. According to Guagenti, Urich, who was
writing his memoirs, titled "An Extraordinary Life," was hospitalized
for breathing problems last week.</TE>
<TE>   According to the book "10,000 Answers: The Ultimate Trivia
Encyclopedia," Urich holds the record of starring in 15 TV shows--the
most of any actor. Throughout his career, Urich moved effortlessly
between drama and comedy, action-thrillers and period westerns.</TE>
<TE>   After appearing in guest roles on television, he made his sitcom
debut in 1973 in the short-lived series "Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice."
The same year, Urich made his feature movie debut in the Clint
Eastwood "Dirty Harry" sequel "Magnum Force."</TE>
<TE>   Among his series were "S.W.A.T." (1975-76); "Soap" (1978);
"Tabitha" (1977-78); "Vega$" (1978-81); "Gavilan" (1982-83);
"Spenser: For Hire" (1985-88); "American Dreamer" (1990-91);
"Crossroads" (1992-93); "It Had to Be You" (1993): "The Lazarus Man"
(1995-96), "Love Boat: The Next Wave" (1998) and "Emeril" (2001).</TE>
<TE>   Producer Aaron Spelling, who cast Urich in a supporting role in
the action show "S.W.A.T." and later as the lead in "Vega$," said
there was a reason Urich kept turning up in series again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just one of the sweetest men I've ever met," Spelling
said. "No matter what you put him in, the audience loved him."</TE>
<TE>   Urich also appeared in numerous TV movies and miniseries,
including the Emmy Award-winner "Lonesome Dove," as well as "The
Defiant Ones," "Stranger at My Door," "Final Descent," "Captains
Courageous" and "Miracle on the 17th Green."</TE>
<TE>   Among his feature credits were "Turk 182!," "Ice Pirates" and
"Cloverbend." His most recent TV movie, "Night of the Wolf,"
premiered Monday evening on Animal Planet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Urich received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He
even founded a publishing company, Beaver Dam Press, which
specializes in outdoor books.</TE>
<TE>   It was during his first season on the TNT western series "The
Lazarus Man" that Urich was diagnosed with cancer. In 2000, he sued
Castle Rock Television, the studio producing the show, alleging that
the company pulled the plug on the series because of his illness.</TE>
<TE>   Urich had told the company in 1996 that despite his cancer he
would be able to perform. In the breach-of-contract suit, which was
settled, Urich sought the approximately $73,000 that he would have
received for each episode in the second season.</TE>
<TE>   Urich went public with his disease as soon as the cancer was
diagnosed, and appeared on such talk shows as "Larry King Live"
during his chemotherapy treatment to discuss his condition. His
openness and optimism about his battle with cancer made him a popular
lecturer.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been flying around the country for the last year talking to
groups," he said in an interview with The Times in 1998. "It's part
of my deal I made with God to spread the word that it is survivable,
that this notion of 'cancer-free' is one that you can achieve."</TE>
<TE>   Of his popularity and steady work in television, Urich once told
The Times:</TE>
<TE>   "I think my longevity has a lot to do with where I come from--a
blue-collar town in Ohio--and how I was raised: to work hard and
respect other folks.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds hokey but I think, ultimately, on television you
can't hide who you are. It's why people are always coming up to me,
not to talk about my shows but about their families, their pets. They
obviously feel comfortable with me."</TE>
<TE>   Athletically built and ruggedly handsome, the 6-foot, 2-inch actor
was born Dec. 16, 1946, in Toronto, Ohio, a blue-collar steel town
west of Pittsburgh. Urich was a football star in the small town and
attended Florida State University on a football scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   As a student, he hosted his own weekly television series. He
earned a bachelor's degree in radio and television communications in
1968 and received a master's in broadcast research and management
from Michigan State University three years later.</TE>
<TE>   He worked briefly as a television weatherman and as an account
executive at WGN-AM radio in Chicago. While at WGN, he was hired to
play a young soldier and open a Jewish United Bond drive with a
patriotic speech. He fell in love with acting, but ended up losing
his job because his boss attended the bond drive and enforced the
station's policy against moonlighting.</TE>
<TE>   Urich made his stage debut in a community theater production in
Chicago of Renee Taylor and Joseph Bologna's romantic comedy "Lovers
and Other Strangers." For the next 18 months, he performed at
Chicago's Ivanhoe Theater and the Arlington Park and Pheasant Run
Theaters.</TE>
<TE>   He got his big break when fellow Florida State alum Burt Reynolds
cast him as his younger brother in a 1972 stage production of Richard
Nash's "The Rainmaker."</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Urich was an athlete, artist, a wonderful friend, and he
was one of those rare people who never said anything unkind about
anybody," Reynolds said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "His professionalism was exemplary," Reynolds added. "I have known
Bob for 35 years, and in all that time he has been the kindest and
most loyal friend. I adore him, his wife and children, and we will
all miss him greatly."</TE>
<TE>   Urich and his wife formed the Heather and Robert Urich Foundation
for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive
Cancer Center. Earlier this year, he donated the $125,000 he won on
the ABC game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" to the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Urich also was the recipient of the Gilda Radner Courage Award
from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., and was
named national spokesman for the American Cancer Society in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The actor returned to the stage in 1999, starring in the national
tour and Broadway production of the Kander and Ebb musical "Chicago,"
playing slick lawyer Billy Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   His wife and three children--Allison, Ryan and Emily--two
brothers, a sister and his mother survive him. A public service is
scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church
in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The family has requested that any donations be made to the
University of Michigan Comprehensive Center's Robert Urich Fund, 1500
E. Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0755.</TE>

<LD>To understand the impulse that moved Congress to pass the Child
Pornography Prevention Act in 1996, look behind today's sordid
headlines. Most publications, including this one, responsibly refuse
to print graphic details of child molestation, whether by pedophile
priests, pornographers or others. But ask cops or prosecutors
specializing in child abuse what the sanitized word "exploitation"
really represents and they'll describe a spectrum of behavior--from
perverted sexual bullying to abject torture, even murder--beyond a
decent human's ability to grasp.</LD>
<LD>   The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court no doubt recoil at such
abuse and understand just how loathsome the images of such
exploitation can be. That they sided Tuesday with the 1st Amendment
by overturning a portion of the 1996 act shows a wise and courageous
allegiance to the rights that are this nation's greatest strength.</LD>
<LD>   The high court has long held that the Constitution protects
pornographic images and sexually explicit speech, no matter how
odious. But in 1982 the court distinguished child pornography from
films or books that depict adults. It ruled that states may ban
images of children engaged in sex acts without running afoul of the
1st Amendment because of the harm "to the physiological, emotional
and mental health of the child."</LD>
<TE>   That decision came before digital technology and the Internet
greatly expanded the ability of people to create and disseminate
realistic images of assaults on children's innocence. Congress
responded with the 1996 act, intended to protect minors from online
smut.</TE>
<TE>   This week the court said Congress went too far when, in two
sections of the law, it equated computer-generated or altered images
of children engaged in pornographic acts with the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act
repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people," wrote Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy for the 6-3 majority. The 1st Amendment does not
protect images of actual children, the court said, but it does
protect sexually explicit images that only appear to depict children.</TE>
<TE>   The court made clear that too narrowly defining the 1st Amendment
would unconstitutionally restrain legitimate artists, including movie
makers, possibly making it a crime to depict sex scenes involving
underage characters, such as those in "American Beauty" or "Lolita."</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the 1996 act had argued that even computer-generated
images could prompt pedophiles to molest children. Unfortunately,
this may be true. But, as Justice Kennedy wrote in his opinion, "The
mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a
sufficient reason for banning it."</TE>
<TE>   The court made the right decision--a tough one. Now we urge
lawmakers to work within these newly articulated constitutional
limits to make it harder for pornographers to exploit real children.</TE>

<LD>One thing wealthy people often fail to understand when they run for
high public office is that they forfeit a share of their personal
privacy. That seems to be the case with Bill Simon Jr., the
Republican nominee for governor. A Simon spokesman says the candidate
does not intend to make his income tax return public because "we just
feel he deserves some privacy."</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to dispute such a bland statement, but Simon's income is
a matter of public concern. Is there a potential conflict of interest
in a candidate's financial holdings? How would he or she deal with
that if elected?</LD>
<LD>   The public has a right to judge for itself whether the candidate
paid a fair share of income taxes or took advantage of legal but
sleazy shelters and deductions.</LD>
<TE>   Simon aides say they met the law by filing a statement of economic
interest with the Fair Political Practices Commission. That's true.
But the information required is so vague as to be virtually
meaningless. The candidate must note only whether the investment fell
in one of three brackets: $1,000 to $10,000, $10,001 to $100,000 or
more than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Simon did not file his tax return Monday but requested a
90-day delay because of the complexity of his finances. Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat seeking reelection, did file and sought to make
some political hay of the fact that Simon did not. But the joint
return filed by Davis and his wife, Sharon, provided some cautionary
information on Davis too.</TE>
<TE>   Their return shows that Sharon Davis earned $37,000 last year as a
director and consultant for Golden State Food, a company owned by
billionaire Ron Burkle, a major Davis patron. Although there was no
secret about Sharon Davis' work, that knowledge puts civic watchdogs
on alert for any Davis action that might be seen as favoring Burkle.</TE>
<TE>   If the state demanded more detailed information on its disclosure
form, it might not be so urgent that the public examine tax returns.
Such strengthening is not likely soon, so Simon should prepare to
release his tax return when he does file for 2001.</TE>

<LD>It goes against the grain to put the name Hugo Chavez and the word
"democracy" in the same sentence. It also seems strange to thank an
army for maintaining democracy. But all of Venezuela has had that
kind of through-the-looking-glass week.</LD>
<LD>   The bizarre failed military coup that made Chavez a prisoner for
48 hours and then restored him as president of Venezuela went against
expectations on several fronts. Latin American nations, several with
an unfortunate history of military takeovers, rushed to demand the
continuance of democracy. The United States, proclaimed champion of
democracy, embarrassed itself by not denouncing the coup and was
further shamed by the revelation that Bush administration officials
had talked to the Venezuelan opposition for months before the coup.</LD>
<TE>   The military action was born of a remarkable drop in Chavez's
popularity in recent months as the economy went downhill. Protests
against the president grew larger, oil workers went on strike and
last week Chavez supporters opened fire on anti-Chavez demonstrators.
That was too much for one faction of the military, which bundled the
president off to an island prison. His opponents falsely claimed that
Chavez had resigned; they installed Pedro Carmona, leader of the
country's biggest business association, as president. Carmona,
another man whose name will never be a synonym for democracy,
dissolved the National Assembly and the Supreme Court. Then
pro-Chavez demonstrators took to the streets and several were killed.
That prompted other members of the military to reverse the coup.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's flamboyant style wasn't dimmed by his brief stint in
jail, but he has sounded more conciliatory. If he reaches out to his
foes rather than continuing to divide the nation along class lines,
Venezuela will benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez is no stranger to coups; as an army paratrooper in 1992 he
unsuccessfully tried to grab power from an elected president. Six
years later he won the presidency at the polls when his populist
demagoguery caught fire with a huge, politically marginalized
underclass. The president then proceeded to spend more time
glad-handing leaders like Moammar Kadafi, Saddam Hussein and Fidel
Castro than improving the economic lives of those who needed it most.
He pushed through constitutional changes to extend his grip on power,
tried to muzzle the press and other critics, flirted with Colombia's
drug guerrillas and packed the Supreme Court and National Assembly
with his allies.</TE>
<TE>   All those are actions for the United States and Venezuela's
neighbors to deplore. But it's one thing to oppose policies and
another to back a coup. Washington quickly welcomed Chavez's ouster
and said he had brought it on himself. It reversed course only when
the Organization of American States denounced the change of regime.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration insisted it did not give a green light to
the attempted ouster. If so, the signals from Washington do not seem
to have been treated seriously. Whatever its intentions, the White
House failed to stay on the side of democracy.</TE>

<HD>Tax Codes: Equitable and Understandable</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Only Suckers Pay Taxes" (Commentary, April 14), John Balzar makes
a great argument for doing away with the IRS. Our tax codes have
become an onerous burden. People and companies are motivated to
cheat, and the cost--at a 20% "tax compliance surcharge"--makes the
IRS tax collection system terribly inefficient. Besides, "There isn't
a single person in the land who believes our tax system is fair or
even remotely close to it." It places every citizen in the position
of being a potential criminal. Psychologically, it is adversarial in
nature, involving antagonistic parties and interests. It just isn't
the way to best support the financial needs of our government.</LD>
<LD>   So let's just do away with it and rely on the sales tax. Make the
sales tax nonregressive by not taxing sales on food and other
essentials. Sounds simple: nonadversarial; easy to administer; those
who spend the most, pay the most. And we can get back to just "three
pages" of instruction, as was the case when the federal income tax
was first introduced in 1913. So what stops us?</LD>
<LD>   George Epstein</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The tax laws are too complex. Congress did this to us. How can we
make it simpler? I would like to see a legal requirement that
constitutional officers of the U.S. (president, vice president,
Cabinet members), along with members of Congress, be required to do
their own tax returns. They can use any of the IRS-published
materials and a hand calculator. Otherwise, no other help. No
computer software. No lawyer or accountant. Just what the IRS
supplies. And show us their results and their work. If they are smart
enough to write the tax code they should be smart enough to use the
tax code on their own.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No doubt there are people clever enough to avoid paying taxes, but
Balzar's whole premise--the rich get away with a free ride--is
absurd. Fortunately, it isn't even debatable, because you can look it
up.</TE>
<TE>   Just this week an Associated Press story pointed out that those
with incomes in the top 5% pay 55% of all income taxes. The bottom
50% of wage earners pay 4.4% of all taxes. Oh, the inequity!</TE>

<LD>Re "Mahony Regrets Transfer of Priest," April 13: It's one thing to
set up and support a system of institutionally supported denial--as
Cardinal Roger Mahony has tried to do--in the case of priests who
have molested children. It's another to be a "leader" in one of the
largest cities in the United States, a city with facilities that set
standards in their fields, like Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and know
nothing about them.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Mahony didn't know that the hospital had a pediatric
unit? I honestly don't know whether to laugh or cry.</LD>
<LD>   Carol P. Bartold</LD>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Child molesters are felons. Those who know of their crimes and
actively cover up for them--thereby enabling them to commit more
crimes--are also felons. At best they are partners in the act, no
better than the molester. At worst, since they are in a position of
authority and have the ability to stop the crime, the molesters
become their agents, and their crimes originate from their seats of
power. At the very least it's called aiding and abetting. A crime,
right?</TE>
<TE>   So, my question is simple. Why haven't the police arrested these
men? There is certainly enough evidence, a lot of which is now
public. Is it that district attorneys and cops across our land are
afraid of the titles "cardinal" and "bishop," or has money changed
hands, or what? I'm stumped. There has to be a reason. In the
meantime, we have another example of unequal justice.</TE>
<TE>   If John Q. Public had done the same thing, he'd be sitting on cold
cement and the world would be a slightly safer place.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The community's treatment of 15-year-old Deanna Maran's murder,
recounted by Michael Cieply (Opinion, April 14), is a tragic reminder
of the nihilistic apathy that pervades our society. Indifference to
violence and human suffering defies socioeconomic categorization. And
here the pain is being furthered by elite institutions claiming
superior moral status and wealthy adult parents, of which surely a
large number hold powerful positions in the community. In light of
tragedies like Maran's and the recent Catholic Church scandals,
should we be looking to our nation's elite for moral leadership?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If "the law's concern, first and foremost, is to protect and
rehabilitate youth," the law has evidently failed miserably in both
respects. So too have the schools and communities involved. If a
teacher at Santa Monica High School told students who stood by and
did nothing while Deanna Maran was being murdered that they must not
risk themselves by carrying a burden of guilt, who--what--will they
be when they are adults? What will those who participated in the
murder and got off scot-free be?</TE>
<TE>   Has anyone been encouraged to do the right thing about what
happened? Has anyone discussed what is the right thing to do? Has
anyone guided these students about how to deal with a burden of guilt
constructively, rather than burying it in their subconscious?</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men
to do nothing"--Edmund Burke. The students involved may have become
"good men" (and women). Instead they've been encouraged to let evil
triumph. Will anyone really be surprised when they let evil triumph
again?</TE>
<TE>   Loren Reichman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do we tolerate terrorism in Los Angeles? With a group encouraging
Maran's murderer, it was just like a classic lynching. Since the
deputy district attorney has no plans to pursue the case, it conveys
the idea that we allow people to get away with murder. Maybe I should
move to Europe, where violence is not tolerated as it is here.</TE>

<LD>Re "Stakes Are High in Push for Latino Court Nominee," April 11: I
was a loyal Democrat for many years, largely because I was convinced
that that party stood with me and mine in the struggle to achieve our
rights on an equal basis with all other Americans. As I read the
comments of prominent Democratic politicians concerning the Miguel
Estrada nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, it becomes increasingly clear that Democrats stood with
Hispanics only when we did what we were told; i.e., always voted
Democratic.</LD>
<LD>   That we would think for ourselves, exercise independent judgment
and reach our own conclusions on matters political was not part of
their understanding of how we should behave. What I believed to be
idealism turned out to be a cynical bargaining for votes.</LD>

<LD>Re "DNA Shakes Up Child Support Law," April 15: I am just amazed that
the so-called child-support advocates insist that a man who is proven
by DNA studies not to be a child's father pay child support because
"you cannot have guys who functioned as some kid's father for 12
years going in and saying, because of some test, all right, I'm off
the hook." Why not?</LD>
<LD>   This comment would be the same as if death penalty advocates said,
"Well, we don't care that the DNA evidence exonerates the convicted
murderer--the victim's family and society have known that he was the
murderer for 12 years, and we can't disappoint them."</LD>
<LD>   While a very small percentage of convicted murderers on death row
have been exonerated by DNA testing, the article points out that an
American Assn. of Blood Banks study found that of 280,000 blood tests
performed to determine the paternity of children, 30% excluded the
subject tested as being the father. What kind of legal system is
this? Fair is fair.</LD>
<TE>   Daniel J. Fink</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was amazed to read this article and find barely a mention of an
effort to find a child's biological father, which DNA evidence would
indicate. The mother most likely knows who he is, and it should be
her duty to her child to point the finger where it belongs, not to
the man she chooses as the most able to support her children.</TE>
<TE>   If a mistake was made in identification, why is the decision made
to force a man to continue support in "the best interest of the
child"? Some of these men's own children suffer under the premise
that we are helping a fatherless child. Let that man remain in the
child's life if he chooses, free of forced support, and find the true
father who created this child and force him to pay. That is the right
thing to do.</TE>

<HD>Policy on Iraq Leaves Bush Open to Attack</HD>

<LD>So Immanuel Wallerstein thinks George W. Bush is incompetent ("Iraq
War: The Coming Disaster," Commentary, April 14). He believes the
only thing America has left is military superiority. The only thing
we have accomplished is the downfall of the weak and impoverished
Taliban. I guess saving millions of lives from starvation, disease,
famine and oppression doesn't mean anything. Restoring schools and
human rights and giving children hope for a better future is
meaningless. Our incompetent president believes human dignity is
worth fighting for. What a loser! I can't believe you guys at The
Times actually printed that sick rhetoric.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wallerstein's opening line, "George W. Bush is a geopolitical
incompetent," says it all and extends even into Bush's handling of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Every European knows this, but it
seems that no American does. Worse still, with Iraq in particular,
not a small amount of Bush's attention turns on "touching up" what
Dad failed to do.</TE>

<LD>Re "Kindergarten Is for the Kids," letters, April 13: As elementary
school teachers, my wife and I agree that, ideally, kindergarten
should be less about curriculum and more about socialization.
However, I ask the letter writers and others who agree with them, are
you willing to accept lower test scores in the following grades?</LD>
<LD>   As long as the emphasis is placed on achieving a certain level of
scores in the early grades, kindergarten will increasingly be more
academically challenging. The nation's children will continue to
sprint to academic exhaustion when they should be truly paced for the
educational marathon, as Leonard Penzo so eloquently wrote.</LD>

<LD>Re "Salvation Mountain Artist Has Blessings Bestowed on His Work"
(April 11), on Leonard Knight's desert art, which consists of 100,000
gallons of paint painted on sand in the desert: Tell me if I'm wrong,
but aren't we supposed to dispose of this toxic material at recycling
centers by law? How are painting the sand and, in effect, letting
100,000 gallons of pollutants into the ground water to be considered
art?</LD>
<LD>   I guess if I dump some paint down my sewer drain and it flows to
the ocean and discolors the sand, water or swimmers then that is
considered art too.</LD>

<HD>Robert Urich, 55; Popular Star of 'Vega$' and 'Spenser'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Urich, the personable actor best known for his tough-guy TV
roles as Las Vegas private detective Dan Tana on "Vega$" and as
Robert Parker's sophisticated Boston private investigator in
"Spenser: For Hire," died Tuesday morning of cancer. He was 55.</LD>
<LD>   Urich, whose career spanned 30 years, died at the Los Robles
Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, said his publicist, Cindy
Guagenti. His wife of 28 years, actress Heather Menzies, and his
three children were with him at the time.</LD>
<LD>   Six years ago, Urich was diagnosed with synovial cell sarcoma, a
rare form of cancer that attacks the joints. The cancer was
discovered in his groin, and had gone into remission after
chemotherapy, radiation treatment and two surgeries.</LD>
<TE>   Urich told Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd in November that
more lumps had been found over the summer, but that a "wonder drug"
had cleared up the recurrence. According to Guagenti, Urich, who was
writing his memoirs, titled "An Extraordinary Life," was hospitalized
for breathing problems last week.</TE>
<TE>   According to the book "10,000 Answers: The Ultimate Trivia
Encyclopedia," Urich holds the record of starring in 15 TV shows--the
most of any actor. Throughout his career, Urich moved effortlessly
between drama and comedy, action-thrillers and period westerns.</TE>
<TE>   After appearing in guest roles on television, he made his sitcom
debut in 1973 in the short-lived series "Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice."
The same year, Urich made his feature movie debut in the Clint
Eastwood "Dirty Harry" sequel "Magnum Force."</TE>
<TE>   Among his series were "S.W.A.T." (1975-76); "Soap" (1978);
"Tabitha" (1977-78); "Vega$" (1978-81); "Gavilan" (1982-83);
"Spenser: For Hire" (1985-88); "American Dreamer" (1990-91);
"Crossroads" (1992-93); "It Had to Be You" (1993): "The Lazarus Man"
(1995-96), "Love Boat: The Next Wave" (1998) and "Emeril" (2001).</TE>
<TE>   Producer Aaron Spelling, who cast Urich in a supporting role in
the action show "S.W.A.T." and later as the lead in "Vega$," said
there was a reason Urich kept turning up in series again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just one of the sweetest men I've ever met," Spelling
said. "No matter what you put him in, the audience loved him."</TE>
<TE>   Urich also appeared in numerous TV movies and miniseries,
including the Emmy Award-winner "Lonesome Dove," as well as "The
Defiant Ones," "Stranger at My Door," "Final Descent," "Captains
Courageous" and "Miracle on the 17th Green."</TE>
<TE>   Among his feature credits were "Turk 182!," "Ice Pirates" and
"Cloverbend." His most recent TV movie, "Night of the Wolf,"
premiered Monday evening on Animal Planet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Urich received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He
even founded a publishing company, Beaver Dam Press, which
specializes in outdoor books.</TE>
<TE>   It was during his first season on the TNT western series "The
Lazarus Man" that Urich was diagnosed with cancer. In 2000, he sued
Castle Rock Television, the studio producing the show, alleging that
the company pulled the plug on the series because of his illness.</TE>
<TE>   Urich had told the company in 1996 that despite his cancer he
would be able to perform. In the breach-of-contract suit, which was
settled, Urich sought the approximately $73,000 that he would have
received for each episode in the second season.</TE>
<TE>   Urich went public with his disease as soon as the cancer was
diagnosed, and appeared on such talk shows as "Larry King Live"
during his chemotherapy treatment to discuss his condition. His
openness and optimism about his battle with cancer made him a popular
lecturer.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been flying around the country for the last year talking to
groups," he said in an interview with The Times in 1998. "It's part
of my deal I made with God to spread the word that it is survivable,
that this notion of 'cancer-free' is one that you can achieve."</TE>
<TE>   Of his popularity and steady work in television, Urich once told
The Times:</TE>
<TE>   "I think my longevity has a lot to do with where I come from--a
blue-collar town in Ohio--and how I was raised: to work hard and
respect other folks.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds hokey but I think, ultimately, on television you
can't hide who you are. It's why people are always coming up to me,
not to talk about my shows but about their families, their pets. They
obviously feel comfortable with me."</TE>
<TE>   Athletically built and ruggedly handsome, the 6-foot, 2-inch actor
was born Dec. 16, 1946, in Toronto, Ohio, a blue-collar steel town
west of Pittsburgh. Urich was a football star in the small town and
attended Florida State University on a football scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   As a student, he hosted his own weekly television series. He
earned a bachelor's degree in radio and television communications in
1968 and received a master's in broadcast research and management
from Michigan State University three years later.</TE>
<TE>   He worked briefly as a television weatherman and as an account
executive at WGN-AM radio in Chicago. While at WGN, he was hired to
play a young soldier and open a Jewish United Bond drive with a
patriotic speech. He fell in love with acting, but ended up losing
his job because his boss attended the bond drive and enforced the
station's policy against moonlighting.</TE>
<TE>   Urich made his stage debut in a community theater production in
Chicago of Renee Taylor and Joseph Bologna's romantic comedy "Lovers
and Other Strangers." For the next 18 months, he performed at
Chicago's Ivanhoe Theater and the Arlington Park and Pheasant Run
Theaters.</TE>
<TE>   He got his big break when fellow Florida State alum Burt Reynolds
cast him as his younger brother in a 1972 stage production of Richard
Nash's "The Rainmaker."</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Urich was an athlete, artist, a wonderful friend, and he
was one of those rare people who never said anything unkind about
anybody," Reynolds said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "His professionalism was exemplary," Reynolds added. "I have known
Bob for 35 years, and in all that time he has been the kindest and
most loyal friend. I adore him, his wife and children, and we will
all miss him greatly."</TE>
<TE>   Urich and his wife formed the Heather and Robert Urich Foundation
for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive
Cancer Center. Earlier this year, he donated the $125,000 he won on
the ABC game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" to the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Urich also was the recipient of the Gilda Radner Courage Award
from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., and was
named national spokesman for the American Cancer Society in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The actor returned to the stage in 1999, starring in the national
tour and Broadway production of the Kander and Ebb musical "Chicago,"
playing slick lawyer Billy Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   His wife and three children--Allison, Ryan and Emily--two
brothers, a sister and his mother survive him. A public service is
scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church
in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The family has requested that any donations be made to the
University of Michigan Comprehensive Center's Robert Urich Fund, 1500
E. Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0755.</TE>

<HD>County Yields to Irvine on El Toro Land</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walking away from eight years and $54 million worth of planning,
Orange County supervisors voted Tuesday to hand the closed El Toro
Marine base to the city of Irvine, which wants to turn much of it
into parkland.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a significant decision," said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who
pushed for the idea. "It was a slim vote, but we said unequivocally
that not only is El Toro dead [as an airport] but the Board of
Supervisors believes that too."</LD>
<LD>   Armed with the county's support, Irvine officials said they will
meet Thursday in Washington to discuss the base's future with the
Navy, which still owns it.</LD>
<TE>   "This puts wind in our sails for the trip back to D.C.," Irvine
City Councilman Chris Mears said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month Navy officials announced their intent to decide by
April 23 whether to sell El Toro and use the proceeds to bolster the
defense budget. They could sell all or part of the 4,700-acre
base--regardless of Irvine's plan to annex the property.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, long a supporter
of building an airport at El Toro, cast the deciding votes for Irvine
to take control of the base land. She did so after pressing for--and
being promised--about $2 million from state park bond funds to
develop parks in north Orange County, where she is from.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my emotional issue," Coad said of the park money. "The
citizens in north county will say, 'This is great; we're going to
work together [on the need for more northern parks]. We're going to
be hoping Irvine is successful.'"</TE>
<TE>   Coad also was promised up to $800,000 in property tax money from
base development to be used for a park trust fund for north Orange
County, where parks are scarce. City officials said they intend to
divert new property taxes into a redevelopment fund but promised to
fulfill Coad's demand for tax money for parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent is to honor this," Mears said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Irvine's plan, about 3,200 acres would go to the city. The
Navy would keep 440 acres to sell along the base's southern edge--an
area the city said it would rezone for 1,500 homes. Money from the
sale of the homes would be sent to the Navy as payment for giving
Irvine the bulk of the base.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the base, which closed in 1999, already has been
set aside by the federal government for a wildlife sanctuary. About
100 acres would stay under county control for various programs and to
provide housing for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine wants to develop most of the base as parkland and other
public uses consistent with last month's countywide vote to replace
airport zoning at El Toro with zoning for a large urban park, nature
preserve and limited development.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a delegation of elected officials from Los Angeles and
Orange counties arrived Tuesday in Washington to urge federal
officials to postpone the Navy's sale decision.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of local leaders met with Federal Aviation
Administration officials to lobby for the development of an airport
at El Toro to handle Southern California's future air travel needs,
said El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon, who advocates an El Toro airport
to relieve pressure to expand Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said late Tuesday that he was "very encouraged" by a
meeting with FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, who promised to try to
push the Navy to postpone its April 23 decision. Several north Orange
County cities are backing an alternative airport plan for El Toro and
hope to place it before voters in November.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very encouraged and thought the meeting was very
constructive," Gordon said from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine contingent, including representatives from other
supportive south Orange County cities, had hoped to take to
Washington the unanimous support of county supervisors. But two
supervisors, Jim Silva and Chuck Smith, voted against Irvine's plan,
saying it was short on details, including financing.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Eckles, executive director of a nine-city coalition that
backs Irvine's plan, said the group will argue that the sale would be
quicker--and would produce higher value--under the Irvine plan
because of the new housing that would be built. Irvine would not
allow the new housing if the base were sold piecemeal by the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Navy doesn't bite, they'll sell the base," Eckles said.
"That's their Plan B."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine City Manager Allison Hart said the city would ask
developers to pay for improvements on their portions as well as to
shoulder some costs of developing the park. The development plan
includes 370 acres for a new campus of Cal State Fullerton, 126 acres
for an adjacent research park and 228 acres for university-controlled
housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Fair would take another 300 acres for an
expansion. The city also would develop two golf courses, sports
fields and 463 acres for wholesale nurseries. A series of streams and
wild lands would run through the property and act as wildlife
corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who brokered the agreement with Coad, said he assured her
that park development would occur throughout Orange County, not just
at El Toro. "There needs to be access for recreational opportunities
countywide," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating El Toro's fate was a separate supervisors' vote,
hours earlier Tuesday, to encourage the relocation of the Marine
Corps' West Coast boot camp to El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Jones has suggested taking
1,300 acres at El Toro to move recruits from San Diego, where they
train on 388 acres next to that city's overcrowded international
airport. Doing so would require federal legislation, since the base
already has been closed.</TE>
<TE>   Coad, Smith and Silva said the Marines would be welcome to stay in
Orange County. Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson said moving
the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego could upset Irvine's
redevelopment plans but voted for the resolution anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I think national security has a higher priority than the city of
Irvine," Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   In other El Toro business, the board voted to have no role in
environmental cleanup of the former base, including conducting
independent soil tests. The board's action was motivated solely by
economics and the supervisors attempts to protect the county's
general fund.</TE>
<TE>   But the board's pulling away from base expenses stopped with some
of the lucrative contracts for Washington, D.C., lobbyists and public
affairs firms that just a month and half ago were lobbying for an
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Since voters pulled the plug on the airport in the March 5
election, the county's pro-airport lobbying team in Washington has
been accruing bills at an estimated cost of $62,000 a month, Spitzer
argued.</TE>
<TE>   But supervisors said they wanted a clearer understanding of which
contracts would be terminated before voting and decided instead to
postpone a decision until next week's meeting.</TE>

<HD>Woeful Tigers End Losing Streak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After waiting two weeks for their first win of the season, the
Detroit Tigers made sure to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   Randall Simon drove in three runs and Jose Lima pitched six
scoreless innings as Detroit ended an 11-game skid with a 9-3 win
over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Tuesday night at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   With the crowd standing and chanting "Let's go Tigers," Juan
Acevedo pitched a scoreless ninth to end it. After Acevedo got Brent
Abernathy on a comebacker for the final out, first baseman Dmitri
Young jumped into the pitcher's arms.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew if I was involved with the last out, I was going to do
something special, something stupid," Young said with an ear-to-ear
smile while opening a can of beer. "It feels great to get that first
win out of the way. It's just too bad we won't be in the national
spotlight anymore because I think this team is capable of playing
some good ball."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first win for manager Luis Pujols, who replaced Phil
Garner after six games.</TE>
<TE>   While Young and Acevedo were hugging and dancing near first base,
Pujols was engulfed in several embraces near the mound as the crowd
of 13,256 cheered wildly.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay swept the Tigers to begin Detroit's 0-11 start.</TE>
<TE>   "With the chemistry this team has, we are capable of winning 12 or
13 in a row just as easy as we lost them," shortstop Shane Halter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Kansas City 5--Torii Hunter went three for four with
three runs scored at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Through 14 games, Minnesota's relievers are 4-0 with five saves in
five chances and a 1.85 earned-run average in 511/3 innings. Tony
Fiore, J.C. Romero and Mike Jackson gave up three hits in 32/3
innings Tuesday. Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his sixth save
in six chances.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's rotation, thought to be the strength of the team with
four pitchers who have been All-Stars, is 5-5 with a 7.56 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter has 14 hits in his last 23 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Cleveland 5--Chuck Finley gave up nine runs--eight
earned--and seven hits in 12/3 innings at Chicago and Cleveland's
10-game win streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian bullpen, best in the AL, also gave up its first run in
19 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Magglio Ordonez hit a grand slam to cap a nine-run second inning
for Chicago, which has won six of seven. Royce Clayton added a
two-run homer, and Sandy Alomar Jr. had a two-run single. Kenny
Lofton was one for five against his old team, but he had a beautiful
catch in the fourth inning that robbed Cleveland of at least one run.</TE>
<TE>   With an 11-1 record, Cleveland had the best record in the majors
and was off to its fastest start since opening the 1966 season 14-1.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 14, Toronto 3--Shea Hillenbrand hit a three-run homer, and
Frank Castillo and Rolando Arrojo combined for a four-hitter at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Hillenbrand hit his fifth homer of the season off Brandon Lyon
(0-2) in the third inning, giving Boston a 5-0 lead. The second-year
third baseman went two for four with three runs scored, raising his
batting average to a team-high .413.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 5, New York 4--Tony Batista homered and hit a
tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the eighth inning at New York, handing
the Yankees their sixth loss in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens bounced back from a rough start with seven solid
innings, leaving with a 4-3 lead. But the Yankees could not hold it.</TE>
<TE>   David Segui greeted reliever Ramiro Mendoza (0-1) with a home run
in the eighth that tied the score at 4-4.</TE>

<HD>Percival Expects to Be Activated</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Closer Troy Percival expects to be activated from the disabled list
Thursday before the Angels play at Oakland. Percival, out since April
3 because of a strained muscle in his right side, threw 15 pitches in
a one-inning simulated game Tuesday and reported no pain.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia said he wanted to see how Percival felt
today. But Percival, never one to waste time, declared himself ready.</LD>
<LD>   "If I don't feel anything now, I'm not going feel anything
tomorrow morning," Percival said. "I'm tired of sitting. It's tough
when you know you should be out there doing your job."</LD>
<TE>   Percival faced Angel teammates Jose Nieves and Jeff DaVanon during
the inning. He said he had command of all his pitches and was hitting
about 94-96 mph on the radar gun.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we saw today was encouraging," pitching coach Bud
Black said. "We're happy, the training staff is happy and Troy is
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Percival was not concerned about topping out at 96 mph, which was
the hardest he threw when he saved a game against Cleveland on April
2, his last outing. Percival underwent tests the following day and
went on the disabled list April 6.</TE>
<TE>   "You give me four or five days and I will be back up to 97-98,"
Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   The bullpen blew only one save opportunity in Percival's absence.</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine had handled the closer duties and had three saves.</TE>
<TE>   Angel designated hitter Brad Fullmer was dropped to eighth in the
batting order Tuesday, the lowest he has been this season. He has not
driven in a run this season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a concern at all," Scioscia said. "Brad hit .300 with
runners in scoring position last year and his history is to hit .300
with runners in scoring position. He is a very, very good run
producer."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer hit .274 with runners in scoring position and drove in 83
runs with Toronto last season.</TE>
<TE>   Angel bench coach Joe Maddon returned to Pennsylvania after his
father died Monday.... Second baseman Adam Kennedy, who is hitting
.200, sat out Tuesday's game. Nieves started in his place.</TE>

games, putting him ahead of last season's pace. Eckstein led the
American League by being hit 21 times.</TE>

<HD>Erstad Is the 10th Power</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He doubles home tying and winning runs to give
Angels a 6-5 victory over Rangers in extra innings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Power in the American League West may reside in Seattle and Oakland,
who were playing Tuesday. But the better show was in Anaheim, where
the Angels and Texas Rangers were playing.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the Angels rallied for a 6-5 victory in the 10th
inning on Darin Erstad's game-winning double, there had been
something for all the 15,385 at Edison Field to enjoy.</LD>
<LD>   Intrigue: Angel pitcher Aaron Sele, who signed a three-year,
$24-million contract in the off-season, was making his third start,
hoping to see the sixth inning for the first time. He did and walked
away with a no-decision, his high-point this season.</LD>
<TE>   Comedy: Ranger outfielder Kevin Mench forgot there was only one
out after snagging a fly in the first inning and tossed the ball to
umpire Alfonso Marquez, allowing Garret Anderson to score from second
base. Mench later fell down while running to first after a single in
the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Mystery: Angel third baseman Troy Glaus left after three innings,
because of what was said to be problems with his contact lenses. He
had struck out in two at-bats, stranding four runners.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, drama: Erstad ripped an 0-2 pitch into the
right-field corner, scoring Jose Nieves from second with the tying
run. David Eckstein, followed, beating the relay to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this is not how the AL West will be won, but it was
entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a win, so we're going to treat this as a positive," Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "We got music playing in [the clubhouse]
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The tune was a bit different for the Rangers, whose bullpen has
given up 16 runs in the last 112/3 innings. John Rocker took a
one-run lead into the 10th. But Nieves beat out an infield hit and
Eckstein walked. Erstad then brought them home.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it's all about," Erstad said. " That's what you want
to get done. That was fun for me. I feel great now, we won."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad certainly starred in this production, although he wasn't
feeling so great in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   He went face first into the fence while trying to catch a booming
triple by Frank Catalanotto. Erstad was slow to get up, then had to
go back to work. Rusty Greer, the next batter, hit a line drive to
left-center that Erstad made a leaping try on. It went for a double
to give the Rangers a 4-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, Erstad sprinted to his left, leaped and extended
himself to make a diving catch on a Mike Lamb line drive.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Erstad's performance, Sele said: "You better ask him
how he feels about me after I tried to kill him tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Not a problem, Erstad said: "I prefer that to all the 0 for 4 days
I had hitting against him."</TE>
<TE>   Sele gave up a three-run homer to Alex Rodriguez in the first
Tuesday, but settled down. He went 62/3 innings, allowing three
earned runs.</TE>

<LD>Maury Wills, Gil Hodges, Roger Maris and Tony Oliva were among 200
former players who made the first cut in voting for Hall of Fame
Veterans Committee candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby Bonds, Dick Allen, Ron Santo and Rocky Colavito also were
among the players who advanced from the original list of 1,400, who
were no longer eligible to be voted into the Hall by the Baseball
Writers Association of America.</LD>
<LD>   An overview committee of 10 historians and veteran baseball
writers made the selections and also picked 60 managers, umpires and
executives.</LD>
<TE>   In its next phase, a BBWAA-appointed screening committee will cut
the eligible players to 25 and managers, executives and umpires to
15. The final ballots will be announced in the fall and a new
Veterans Committee will vote in early 2003 with candidates requiring
75% of the vote to be elected.</TE>

<TE>   Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams will be out of the lineup
for at least three games because of soreness in both shoulders. New
York also got bad news regarding left-hander Andy Pettitte, who will
miss his next start because of a tender pitching elbow.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics put left-handed starter Mark Mulder on the
15-day disabled list, retroactive to April 12, because of a strain in
his left forearm.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (2-1), who led the AL with 21 wins last season, left his
start last Thursday at Texas after four innings because of tightness
in the arm.</TE>

<LD>Looking back, it seems like a slam dunk. The Lakers had the No. 2
pick in the 1960 draft and Jerry West of West Virginia was available.</LD>
<LD>   But the Lakers nearly blew their shot at the Hall of Famer,
according to Arlee Pollard, widow of Jim Pollard, who was finishing
an interim term as Laker coach at the time.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody said Jerry West was the guy the Lakers should pick,"
recalled Arlee last week at Staples Center where her late husband was
among the Minneapolis Lakers honored with a banner. "But Jim kept
saying the Lakers didn't need a guard. They needed a center.</LD>
<TE>   "Darrall Imhoff was the guy they were interested in, so they went
out to look at him. But Imhoff didn't quite have it. And that's how
you got Jerry West."</TE>
<TE>   Add Imhoff: He was drafted by the New York Knicks and wound up as
one of the hapless defenders against Wilt Chamberlain on the night in
1962 when Chamberlain scored 100 points.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-10, 220-pound Imhoff often found himself trying to stop
the 7-1, 275-pound Chamberlain.</TE>
<TE>   Imhoff even mentioned Chamberlain in his farewell speech.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a privilege," Imhoff said, "to have spent 12 years in his
armpits."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Imhoff became a Laker, but he was traded in 1968,
along with Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers, for whom?</TE>
<TE>   Say what? Cleveland Indian Manager Charlie Manuel's body of work
makes him the top contender among active big league figures for Yogi
Berra's crown as king of the unintentional one-liners.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rosenbloom lists the following Manuelisms in the Chicago
Tribune:</TE>
<TE>   * "I'm going to let the chips fall where they lay."</TE>
<TE>   * "When Russell [Branyan] is striking out, he's missing the ball a
lot."</TE>
<TE>   * "If I'm going to use Wil [Cordero], I have to start using him."</TE>
<TE>   Yogi couldn't have said any of it better.</TE>
<TE>   Human launching pad: Milwaukee Brewer pitcher Ben Sheets was
roughed up for 10 runs and 13 hits in only 21/3 innings of his final
spring-training appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel writer what pitches the
opposition had hit, Sheets said, "First [pitch] breaking balls,
[first pitch] changeups, full-count changeups, fastballs in, fastball
away, fastballs behind 'em. Balls I didn't even throw were getting
hit."</TE>
<TE>   At least that cut down on the catcher's workload. He didn't have
to worry about signals.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Chamberlain.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Christopher Cain, golf pro at Penn State, will try to
get into the "Guinness Book of Records" today by playing 500 holes in
12 hours. The record is 476 holes in 12 hours, set by Brennan
Robertson of Sarasota, Fla., two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Cain hopes to finish 10 holes every 15 minutes on
the 6,022-yard Penn State White Course.</TE>
<TE>   If he's successful, Cain, who expects to raise $50,000 for charity
through pledges, will cover about 95 miles in playing nearly 28
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   He'll use a cart modified to travel about 20 mph. He plans to eat
and drink in the cart and take bathroom breaks about every 100 holes.</TE>
<TE>   So when this man asks to play through, be assured, he won't take
no for an answer.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Must Open Coffers</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Building on this season's momentum depends on
whether team makes a legitimate effort to retain Olowokandi, Brand,
Odom, McInnis and Maggette.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers' 92-84 victory Tuesday over the Memphis Grizzlies before
the 16th consecutive sellout crowd of more than 18,000 at Staples
Center was their 39th victory. A victory tonight over the Golden
State Warriors in the regular-season finale would mark only the third
time the franchise has won 40 games or more since relocating from San
Diego in 1984.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's up to management to keep the momentum rolling.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Roeser, Clipper executive vice president, made the strongest
statement yet that the team will be kept intact for the foreseeable
future and the payroll will increase to a point that it will probably
top the NBA's salary cap for next season.</LD>
<TE>   "Not only do we want and need to take a step forward, we're in a
position to do it," Roeser said. "We're going to be over the cap.
It's inevitable. We understand that. I think, when you look at the
success of this team and the direction of this team, we'll be able to
do it and still support the higher payroll."</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Clippers' $34-million payroll was not only the
lowest in the league, it was well below the $42.5-million salary cap.
The cap has risen steadily since it was first introduced in 1984-85.
Next season's figure will be determined in a few months.</TE>
<TE>   All that was accomplished on the court this season will mean
nothing if the front office fails this summer to re-sign free agents
Michael Olowokandi and Jeff McInnis and give extensions to Elton
Brand, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers took a significant first step Tuesday by announcing
they have picked up the options on contracts for Keyon Dooling,
Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson. They will be eligible to become
restricted free agents after the 2003-04 season.</TE>
<TE>   Matters will get more difficult come July 1, when the negotiation
period begins for new contracts for free agents. The Clippers then
have from July 16 until Oct. 31 to sign Olowokandi and McInnis and
offer extensions to Brand, Maggette and Odom.</TE>
<TE>   Re-signing Olowokandi is "at the top of the list," General Manager
Elgin Baylor said of his off-season priorities. He was less certain
about McInnis and more than a little hazy on his plans for the three
players eligible for extensions. After all, it could get a little
expensive, dropping $84 million on Olowokandi and perhaps as much as
$100 million on Brand in "maxed-out" deals over six and seven
seasons, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Roeser put it this way: "In my opinion, this group is better than
any we've ever had. They're worthy of retaining at whatever [price]
we need to do to retain them. Our priority is going to be retaining
our own players."</TE>
<TE>   Told of Roeser's comments, Brand said, "That's good news. I try
not to worry about those things. Hopefully, it happens."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's new contract will no doubt be viewed by many
Clipper-watchers as the test to see how serious management is about
keeping this team together. Roeser's comments Friday certainly were a
good-faith gesture, which might have helped settle Olowokandi's
jangled nerves had they been made several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's statement April 3 expressing his concern over a lack
of a contract for next season and beyond, and the toll he believed it
was taking on the team's play was met with anger by Baylor, who
initially fined the 7-foot center $50,000, then rescinded it when
Olowokandi apologized Friday.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how you look at it--except perhaps through Clipper
glasses--it was a clumsy affair from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi said he didn't know a new contract could not be
negotiated until after July 1. Baylor fined Olowokandi because he
took the comments personally. Olowokandi said he was not directing
them at Baylor, but at Roeser and owner Donald T. Sterling. A team
spokesman announced the fine had been rescinded, but Baylor and
Olowokandi each said it stood and the money would be donated to
charity. The spokesman then had to set the record straight,
presumably informing Baylor and Olowokandi there would be no fine.</TE>
<TE>   Confused?</TE>
<TE>   Mercifully, such episodes were kept to a minimum this season. The
emphasis was on the Clippers' play on the court, which was sometimes
spectacular and sometimes subpar, but always entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's late-season surge seemed to signal that he might
truly be worthy of big money at season's end. He averaged 16.8 points
and 10.7 rebounds in March, and 15.5 points and 6.8 rebounds in six
games in April before Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, acquired last summer in a trade with the Chicago Bulls,
emerged as an All-Star who could be counted on to score 18 points and
take 11 rebounds in almost every game.</TE>
<TE>   Miles and Richardson improved greatly from their rookie seasons,
with Miles showing he can become more than a dunking machine and
Richardson developing a deft touch from the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   The reason the team did not advance to the playoffs was that
injuries to Odom, who played only 29 games because of a wrist injury
and an eight-game drug suspension, and Maggette (hand) and Dooling
(ankle) were too much to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   The team's depth kept it competitive through March, but the
Clippers went into Tuesday's game with 11 losses in their last 15
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we're happy, but no, we're not content," Coach Alvin Gentry
said. "We're very disappointed we didn't make the playoffs....If we
had Lamar, Corey and Keyon the whole time, we make the playoffs. I'm
not trying to pump up Lamar Odom, but when you lose a guy like that,
obviously it's going to affect your team."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry made it clear he's looking forward to having a healthy Odom
join Olowokandi and Brand on the Clipper front line next season. It
will be like adding a new player, he has said often recently.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a huge disappointment to everyone if we don't make
the playoffs [next season]," Gentry said. "We have to improve. We
didn't make the playoffs [this season]. We have to be better next
year than we were this year."</TE>

<HD>Home Finale Is Quite a Joy Against Grizzlies</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One by one, the Clippers gave selected fans the jerseys off their
backs Tuesday. There was one final feel-good moment for the Clippers
and their fans this season at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Well, actually, there were two. The Clippers dispatched the
overmatched Memphis Grizzlies, 92-84, which was to be expected and
helped to explain why not everyone in the sellout crowd of 20,264
stuck around for the final buzzer.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers finish on the road tonight against the Golden State
Warriors. A victory would give them a 40-42 record, only two years
removed from a 15-67 mark.</LD>
<TE>   Only one team in NBA history, the Houston Rockets of the early
1980s, has gone from 15 victories to 40 or more in two years. The
Clippers also could win 40 games for only the third time since the
franchise relocated from San Diego in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage, any win is a great win for us," Coach Alvin Gentry
said after the Clippers ended a three-game losing streak. "We're
still trying to get to 40 wins, so there's incentive for us to go up
and win at Golden State. Forty wins just sounds so much better than
39."</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi scored 25 points and took eight rebounds
to ensure the Clippers could still meet one of their remaining goals.
Four other Clippers had 10 points or more, including Corey Maggette,
who had 13 on six-for-nine shooting in only 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Pau Gasol led the Grizzlies with 19 points.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A permanent display of the Dodgers' 10 retired numbers will be
unveiled Thursday when the team returns to Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers of Walter Alston (24), Roy Campanella (39), Don
Drysdale (53), Jim Gilliam (19), Sandy Koufax (32), Tom Lasorda (2),
Pee Wee Reese (1), Jackie Robinson (42), Duke Snider (4) and Don
Sutton (20) will hang from the right- and left-field pavilions.</LD>
<LD>   All of the numbers except that of Robinson, who broke baseball's
color barrier, will be displayed in blue letters with a white
background enclosed in a circular pattern. Robinson's No. 42, retired
throughout the major leagues in 1997, will be in white letters with a
blue background.</LD>
<TE>   "The idea came out of always wanting to find a permanent place to
have Jackie Robinson's number," said Kris Rone, executive vice
president of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown played light catch at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday as he
continued to rehabilitate after tearing scar tissue in his right arm
while pitching last Saturday against the San Diego Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who will miss his regular turn Thursday against the Padres,
tossed the ball from 60 feet with physical therapist Pat Screnar.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. [Frank] Jobe instructed him that if he was comfortable enough
to give it a shot," General Manager Dan Evans said. "He threw free
and easy and without discomfort. Like playing catch with your buddy
or your dad."</TE>
<TE>   Odalis Perez said he felt great physically and mentally the day
after his 128-pitch complete game against the Rockies on Monday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who had elbow surgery in 1999, threw 87 pitches in his
first start on April 4 against the San Francisco Giants and 55
pitches on April 10 against the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "I was more sore after my last start than I am today," Perez said.
"I played catch and everything felt good."</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhisa Ishii won't be worried about Coors Field's
hitter-friendly reputation when he pitches there for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Not after pitching for 10 pro seasons in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard that the ball flies out here quite prevalently," Ishii
said through an interpreter. "At the same time, baseball stadiums in
Japan are generally smaller, so it's kind of the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado third baseman Todd Zeile, who played for the Dodgers in
1997 and 1998, left the game after the third inning when his wife,
former Olympic gold-medal gymnast Julianne McNamara, fell and broke
her ankle at Coors Field. McNamara is eight months pregnant.</TE>

<HD>Rockies' Big Inning Is Bigger</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodgers hit three home runs in the fourth, but
Colorado gets to Ashby in the sixth for 6-4 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers produced a big inning for the second game in a row
Tuesday night against the Colorado Rockies.</LD>
<LD>   And for the second consecutive night, that was all they produced.</LD>
<LD>   This time, however, it was not enough and resulted in a 6-4 loss
before 30,354 at Coors Field.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who made a five-run first inning stand up for a
victory Monday night, could not do the same after hitting three home
runs during a four-run fourth that gave them a 4-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some opportunities," first baseman Eric Karros said. "We
just weren't able to cash in."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby suffered his first loss as a Dodger, giving up six runs
and nine hits in five innings. The Rockies scored four runs in the
sixth inning on five consecutive hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are 4-4 on this nine-game trip that concludes today
against a Rocky team that won its first game against a National
League West opponent after eight consecutive losses. It was also the
Rockies' first win in their last seven games against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have taken a very solid road trip and turned it into a
great one if we had just come up with a base hit in a couple of those
run-producing situations," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "Tonight is
another case of that."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy shuffled the lineup to give left fielder Brian Jordan the
night off, and just about every player involved in the switches
produced.</TE>
<TE>   Hiram Bocachica made his first career start in left field and
batted second, Karros moved from sixth to fifth in the lineup and
Marquis Grissom played center field in place of leadoff man Dave
Roberts and batted sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Bocachica, catcher Paul Lo Duca, and Grissom all hit home runs in
the fourth against Rocky starter Jason Jennings (1-1) to give the
Dodgers a 4-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Dodgers' first three-homer inning since June 28, when
Gary Sheffield, Shawn Green and Adrian Beltre homered in the eighth
inning of a 7-4 victory at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, however, was not sharp.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fighting myself the first two innings and pretty much all
game," said Ashby, who threw 92 pitches, 55 for strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby (1-1) was on the defensive from the outset as leadoff hitter
Juan Pierre nailed him with a line drive on the right leg.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby stayed in the game, but Pierre stole second, moved to third
on Juan Uribe's grounder to second and scored when second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek could not come up with a broken-bat single by Larry
Walker that sent the barrel of the bat flying toward second.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies went ahead, 2-0, on Jennings' run-scoring double to
the right-field corner in the second inning, setting the stage for
the Dodgers' big inning.</TE>
<TE>   Bocachica led off with a homer to right-center and, one out later,
Lo Duca hammered his first homer into the left-field seats to tie the
score.</TE>
<TE>   Karros followed with a single and Grissom then hit a 412-foot
homer to center for a 4-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby held off the Rockies for one inning before Colorado came
back.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Helton singled to right to start the sixth and scored on a
double by Greg Norton into the right-field gap. The Rockies tied the
score, 4-4, on Todd Hollandsworth's single up the middle. Jose Ortiz
singled to left and the Rockies went ahead on Gary Bennett's ground
ball that spun wildly past Karros for a single that scored
Hollandsworth.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill replaced Ashby and got pinch-hitter Terry Shumpert
to hit a ground ball to shortstop Cesar Izturis to start a double
play, but Ortiz scored from third to make it 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had two men on in the sixth, but Jennings got Beltre
to hit a ground ball that third baseman Norton turned into a 5-3
double play.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Green drew a walk from reliever Todd Jones and
moved to second on Karros' one-out single, his third hit of the game.
Jones, however, got Grissom to hit a ground ball near second base.
Uribe, the shortstop, scooped up the ball, stepped on the bag and
fired to Helton at first to complete the double play.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Jimenez came on in the ninth for the Rockies and earned his
third save when Beltre hit a fly ball to right and Grudzielanek and
pinch-hitter Dave Hansen grounded out.</TE>
<TE>   "In this ballpark you have a chance to come from behind,"
Bocachica said. "We should have scored more than four runs. I don't
think we got satisfied, they started making better pitches."</TE>

<LD>During his long career, Hall of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel has run
only three horses in the Kentucky Derby. Pendelton Ridge, a maiden,
and Burnt Hills finished 13th and 14th, respectively, in 1990 and
Aptitude was second to Fusaichi Pegasus two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   This year, Frankel could have two 3-year-olds in the world's most
famous race.</LD>
<LD>   Medaglia d'Oro is a given, having won the San Felipe Stakes last
month at Santa Anita before finishing a close second to Buddha in
Saturday's Wood Memorial.</LD>
<TE>   Royal Gem, a Royal Academy colt Frankel trains for Helen Smith and
the Blatz Limited Partnership, could also join the fray.</TE>
<TE>   Unbeaten in two turf races at Santa Anita, Royal Gem will try to
stay perfect in the $100,000 Forerunner Stakes at 11/8 miles today on
the Keeneland turf course.</TE>
<TE>   If he wins--and he will be favored--Royal Gem could make his main
track debut in the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Solis, the colt's regular jockey, will be in Lexington to
ride. Leading the jockey standings by 10 victories over Kent
Desormeaux and Laffit Pincay at Santa Anita, Solis couldn't have
ridden there anyway today because of a three-day suspension that
continues through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Special Ring, an impressive winner in his most
recent start on the Santa Anita turf, is one of seven scheduled to go
in today's seventh at a mile on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Wayne Lukas. The trainer has won with seven of his
first 13 starters at Keeneland and leads the standings.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Scott Lake and Bill Mott. The trainers have won at a
22% clip this year, but are off to slow starts at Aqueduct, having
won a combined four races in 44 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three, using Saint Bernadette and Yet
Anothernatalie in the third, singling Sandbox in the fourth and using
all in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/221. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $8.20/$1,277. Total money bet: $1,378.</TE>

<HD>There's No Time to Rest for Jones</HD>
<DH>Track and field: While looking ahead to Athens, she gears
up for her fifth consecutive appearance at Mt. SAC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The glint in Marion Jones' eyes and the brightness of her smile
weren't illusions produced by the makeup artists who hovered over her
during a magazine photo shoot Tuesday. The prospect of beginning
another track season--one in which she hopes to "go to the edge ...
[to] touch times that have never been touched before"--produced a
glow no cosmetic could create.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly halfway between her five-medal performance at the Sydney
Olympics and planning an encore at the 2004 Athens Games, Jones has
taken stock and decided she can push herself harder to again reach
the extraordinary levels she attained a few years ago. That push will
begin in earnest this weekend, when she makes her fifth consecutive
appearance at the Mount San Antonio College Relays in Walnut,
competing in the 400 meters.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been running here since I was running for junior track clubs
the West Valley Eagles," said Jones, who runs at Mt. SAC for little
besides a thank you, instead of the huge fees she usually commands.</LD>
<TE>   The support she always gets from friends and family at the meet
might help her get through the 400, a race she hates because it's too
punishing for a body accustomed to delivering shorter, powerful
bursts in the 100 and 200. But she and coach Trevor Graham decided
she needs something more than sprints to build strength and
endurance, making this the first of several 400s she might run this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I promise you, I'll never get to a point in my career where I
like the 400," said Jones, who set a personal best of 49.59 seconds
two years ago at Mt. SAC. "But I'm an athlete, and I've been doing
this 20 years and I know certain things I have to do to be at a
certain level....</TE>
<TE>   "I do want to get back, and I think I'm going to make the move
this year, to really dominating races and getting back to the really
fast times I did in '98 and '99. I want to run faster than I've ever
run before. Let's leave it at that. I'd be quite satisfied to step on
the track and run faster than I ever have."</TE>
<TE>   Jones set her personal bests in the 100 (10.65 seconds), 200
(21.62 seconds) and long jump (23 feet, 113/4 inches) in 1998. She
won every competition she entered that year except the season finale,
when Germany's Heike Drechsler defeated her in the last World Cup
long jump.</TE>
<TE>   She knows everything she does will be measured against that
magical year. No matter that she won her first world title in the 200
last summer at Edmonton--critics emphasized she lost a 100 for the
first time in four years and lost her world championship to Zhanna
Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only have I kind of spoiled myself, but I've spoiled the
media," she said. "They're used to me running fast times every time I
step on the track, and if it doesn't happen, there's something wrong.
I was still winning races, but it was, 'What's wrong with Marion?'</TE>
<TE>   "It was actually kind of funny. In the beginning, I was thinking,
'They don't understand. You're an athlete. You're not going to run
fast every single time.' But I have to agree in general, I do want to
get back there."</TE>
<TE>   Jones won her second successive world 100-meter title in 1999, but
a back injury kept her out of the 200 and kept her off the relays. A
year later at Sydney, as the world wondered if she was brave or
foolish to enter five events, she won the 100 and 200 and ran on the
triumphant 1,600-meter relay. She won bronze in the 400-meter relay
and the long jump.</TE>
<TE>   Her medal haul was a disappointment to no one but her, especially
since she also had to deal with the disclosure her husband, C.J.
Hunter, had tested positive for an anabolic steroid and was suspended
from international competition. Hunter and Jones later separated and
have not reconciled.</TE>
<TE>   As much as she appreciates the gold medals, she looks at the long
jump bronze and wonders if she could do better, even though she won't
jump again until next year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a bit of motivation, to want to go back to Athens and try
to win the gold medal in the long jump," she said. "Elite athletes,
our brains work in one mode, and that's winning. Silver, sure, it
might be great for a lot of people and they might be able to go home
to their hometown and people would celebrate their accomplishment.
Marion coming in second or third place, it doesn't sit well with
Marion. It never has."</TE>
<TE>   Having lived in a media fishbowl by declaring her plans two years
before the Sydney Games, Jones isn't ready to disclose her Athens
intentions yet.</TE>
<TE>   "But you could pretty much bet your first-born child I'm going to
run the 100 meters and 200 and be a member of one or two relays," she
said. "What else I do after that, that's going to be the question at
hand. I'll really be able to answer that in 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who skipped the indoor season but kept busy doing TV
commentary on basketball and track events, said she's fitter now than
a year ago. She looked radiant Monday, and not because of her makeup
and cleverly styled hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel light and I feel ready to run fast," she said. "You get me
on that track in Walnut, California, and I usually am revving to go."</TE>

<HD>Kings Take It in Stride</HD>
<DH>Hockey: News that Forsberg will return to Colorado lineup
for playoff opener is no surprise to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Colorado Avalanche played its wild card Tuesday, announcing that
Peter Forsberg has been cleared to play after an 11-month layoff and
will be in the lineup for Thursday night's playoff opener against the
Kings at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The news was greeted with excitement in Colorado, where the
Avalanche is preparing to begin defense of its Stanley Cup
championship and the addition of an All-Star forward couldn't have
come at a better time. The Avalanche set franchise records this
season for fewest goals scored and number of times shut out.</LD>
<LD>   "To have him come back at this time, especially right with the
playoffs, it's huge for us," Avalanche captain Joe Sakic told Denver
reporters. "You're already excited to go into the playoffs and to
have Pete come back just adds to it."</LD>
<TE>   Said teammate Alex Tanguay: "We found out when we walked in this
morning. Nobody had a clue. It's a big plus for this team, no doubt."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, meanwhile, appeared not at all surprised by the news.
They seemed to sense it coming, and their belief is that Forsberg
will play well.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what they're going to expect from him coming in
after not playing all year," said King defenseman Aaron Miller, who
played five seasons with Forsberg in Denver, "but we'll expect
nothing less than his best game."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, though, added that the Kings were "excited to have the
challenge" and that Forsberg's return will "make the series that much
better."</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, 28, has not played since May 10, when he helped the
Avalanche eliminate the Kings in Game 7 of a Western Conference
semifinal playoff series. Hours after the game, he underwent an
emergency splenectomy.</TE>
<TE>   In September, after undergoing operations on both ankles, he
stunned the Avalanche less than a week into training camp when he
announced in Stockholm that he was taking a leave of absence.</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, in early January, he arrived in Denver to
rejoin the Avalanche and play for Sweden in the Olympics in Salt Lake
City, but those plans were derailed when he needed surgery Jan. 10 to
repair tendon damage in his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said it would be four months before he could return, but
Forsberg, one of the NHL's most dominant players, began skating last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Tuesday's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is great and I'm real excited to get back," Forsberg
told reporters after taking part in contact drills during an
Avalanche practice in suburban Denver. "It's been a long time. I'm
going to be nervous out there, but I think it's great....</TE>
<TE>   "The team has been playing without me all year and now I get to
come back for the fun part. I feel really comfortable and we have a
great team and we have a great opportunity to go far in the
playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Usually a center, Forsberg will move to left wing on a line with
center Chris Drury and right wing Steven Reinprecht. Last spring,
centering that trio, Forsberg had two goals and six assists in the
playoff series against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to wait and see [how he plays], but knowing what kind of
a player Peter is, it would be a big mistake on our part to not pay
attention to him," said King defenseman Mattias Norstrom, a fellow
Swede. "He is a world-class player and he's done it over and over
again, so you've got to be aware when he's out there because if you
let him go, he will hurt you. I think he'd do that if he'd played 80
games this year, or if he missed 10 months."</TE>
<TE>   Said King center Bryan Smolinski, asked if he believed Forsberg
could be effective right away after such a long layoff: "Why not? He
makes $10 million a year, and there's a reason why he makes $10
million a year. It's because he's one of the top 10 forwards in the
world. You can't say enough about him."</TE>
<TE>   Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley was incredulous when he was asked
whether Forsberg's return might adversely affect team chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know too many organizations that would pass on an
opportunity to bring in a Peter Forsberg," he said. "It's great news
at this time of the year to be able to add a world-class player.
Finally, after all these days of waiting, Peter is 100% and ready to
go." He said he would play Forsberg "as much as he can tolerate it."</TE>
<TE>   Without Forsberg and retired defenseman Ray Bourque, the Avalanche
emphasized defense this season in front of goaltender Patrick Roy and
set a franchise record by giving up 169 goals, a league low.</TE>
<TE>   But with high-scoring right wing Milan Hejduk also sitting out the
season's last 20 games after suffering an abdominal injury, they
scored only 212 goals, 58 fewer than last season, and were shut out
10 times.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg is expected to help, but Hartley preached patience.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be fair with Peter," the coach said. "He hasn't played
for a full year. We have to put him on the ice and see how he feels.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his timing will be the biggest question mark, but from
what I saw from the past week of workouts, I've been very impressed."</TE>

<LD>Two NBA organizations have asked for and received permission to
approach Laker consultant Jerry West regarding positions in their
front offices, one of them--believed to be the Memphis
Grizzlies--only recently.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta Hawks obtained permission last summer and have spoken
at length with West, who remains open to resuming a career that
appeared to end nearly two years ago, when he resigned as the Lakers'
executive vice president for basketball operations.</LD>
<LD>   "Without putting a time frame on it, it is true that more than one
team has asked to speak to Jerry," Laker General Manager Mitch
Kupchak said Tuesday. "At Jerry's request, he has asked for us not to
mention which teams."</LD>
<TE>   West, who detests when these matters become public, declined
comment, and Kupchak would not confirm contact by Memphis or Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Though he has refused to address his interest in returning to the
game at length, West has attended more Laker games lately, and keeps
a fairly rigorous schedule as a consultant to the organization. He
attended a recent camp in Portsmouth, Va., for draft-eligible players
and has plans to attend another in Chicago.</TE>

effortless and seamless achievement in Los Angeles, a Laker win over
Sacramento tonight would give them exactly two more victories than
last season. Hold the parade.</LD>
<LD>   They also play to secure the No.3 seed in the Western Conference
playoffs, where the next game against the Kings would be in the
conference finals, Game 1 at clamorous, dangerous Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Regular Season III, Phil Jackson Era, reaches 82 games with the
following story lines, none of them Shaq vs. Kobe, which counts for
something. That is, everybody needs a friend on the road, where the
Lakers could be for much of the coming weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers prefer to stay at No.3, where they'd play the Portland
Trail Blazers in a best-of-five series, Games 1, 2 and, if necessary,
5 at Staples Center, where they've won 14 consecutive games. A
victory over Sacramento would mean home-court advantage in the second
round in any scenario, probably against San Antonio or Dallas, and
the same advantage in the conference finals against all but
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   A loss, and they likely fall to the No. 4 seed, would bring the
Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round and, probably, the Kings in
the second. If they made it through that, they'd probably go back on
the road for Game 1 of the conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking any of that, these are the Kings, and that's often good
enough, Game 1 or Game 82, the world at stake or nothing. A division
champion for the first time since they knocked around Kansas City in
Easter Egg blue, the Kings have clinched all they're going to clinch,
which is home-court advantage from now until the end of June, if
required. For that reason, King Coach Rick Adelman said he would not
play his starters their usual minutes against the Golden State
Warriors on Tuesday or the Lakers tonight. That suits the Lakers
fine, and the Mavericks and Spurs not so fine, but that would be the
cost of losing 24 games.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Lakers stand ready, kind of.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it's going to depend on what Sacramento wants to make out
of the game," Jackson said after Tuesday's practice. "If they're
coming here to play with a full deck, that will put some energy into
the game, and we'll probably know by game time whether it's important
to both of us or to just us."</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, there would not be anything for the Kings to gain
here. They've already walked their regular-season walk, and a
full-effort, burn-the-playbook loss to the Lakers wouldn't do much
for their playoff psyches. Indeed, Adelman might be best off clearing
his bench at halftime and taking the beating with a postseason wink.</TE>
<TE>   As he said this week, "We could play on Saturday, which is not too
long away."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is not so sure it's that simple, but he would be quite
willing to go along.</TE>
<TE>   "If you saw us play an exhibition game against them in Vegas, you
saw how desperately they wanted to win that basketball game," Jackson
said. "I know the Maloofs [owners of the Kings] had just opened their
gambling casino, and those gaming brothers I'm sure wanted their team
to play very well."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is not at all concerned about pushing his rotation to big
minutes, even though Shaquille O'Neal went for 83 and Kobe Bryant 82
in two days.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I play my guys, probably the better off they'll be,
because they won't play again until more than likely Sunday," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   So, whatever the Kings want. Bring Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic
and Mike Bibby. Bring Chucky Brown, Mateen Cleaves and Lawrence
Funderburke.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the team that set the tempo all year," Rick Fox said. "I
don't know why they'd want to do anything else but compete."</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the Lakers can only go along, hope O'Neal gets hale
and Bryant rediscovers his jump shot and someone other than Derek
Fisher makes a three-pointer and the bench becomes more relevant. It
starts this weekend. But first, it starts tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played well enough," Jackson said. "We haven't played great
basketball, but we've played well enough. We sit here in a position
where we're not happy we couldn't make this game [tonight] a very
important game for us.... But nothing's happened that way for us, and
we have to deal with what we have to deal with, and that's the fact
we have to play well and improve our game. That's the goal. I think
we're playing very good basketball right now, maybe the best all
year, excepting the [16-1] start."</TE>

<LD>The "Big Three" kept the Milwaukee Bucks alive.</LD>
<LD>   Behind 24 points from Sam Cassell, 23 from Ray Allen and 22 from
Glenn Robinson, the Bucks routed the Toronto Raptors, 105-89, Tuesday
night at Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got one more," Buck Coach George Karl said. "There's not a
lot of celebration tonight. There's got to be preparation and rest."</LD>
<TE>   The Bucks, Raptors and Indiana Pacers are all 41-40 and fighting
for the final two Eastern Conference playoff berths entering
tonight's regular-season finales. Indiana loses any tiebreakers
between the trio and Milwaukee owns the tiebreaker against Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto finishes the regular season at home against the Cavaliers,
Indiana is at home against Philadelphia and Milwaukee, which has lost
11 in a row on the road, visits Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto lost for only the second time in 13 games since All-Star
Vince Carter was sidelined for the season because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 99, Cleveland 95--Needing a victory to keep their playoff
hopes alive, the Pacers got 34 points from Jermaine O'Neal at
Cleveland and held on for their fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 96, Utah 87--Michael Finley had 35 points and Dirk Nowitzki
returned from a four-game absence because of a sprained ankle to add
24 at Dallas as the Mavericks took their bid to win the Midwest
Division to the final day of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks are tied with the San Antonio Spurs at 57-24.
Because San Antonio holds the tiebreaker, Dallas must win its finale
tonight at Phoenix and the Spurs must lose at Utah.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 95, Phoenix 71--Tim Duncan had 24 points and 11
rebounds at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio played without center David Robinson, placed on the
injured list earlier in the day because of a lower back strain.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 103, New Jersey 98--Chucky Atkins scored 21 points and the
Pistons clinched the second-best record in the Eastern Conference
with a victory at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 102, Atlanta 95--Monty Williams scored 23 points at
Atlanta as the Magic ended a three-game losing streak and gave itself
a chance to clinch the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference tonight
with a victory over the visiting Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 120, Golden State 106--Playing without Chris Webber
(sprained thumb), the Kings got a career-high 29 points from reserve
forward Lawrence Funderburke in a victory at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Jason Richardson scored a career-high 40 points for the
Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 88, Miami 81--Jamal Mashburn scored 23 points at Miami
as the Hornets pulled even with Philadelphia for the fifth playoff
spot in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 116, New York 112--The Wizards won their season finale
at New York, finishing 37-45 and nearly doubling the number of wins
from the 19-63 season of a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   They went 30-30 when Michael Jordan played; 7-15 when he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan ended the season on the injured list because of a bad knee.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 101, Houston 70--James Posey had 26 points as the Nuggets
won at Denver.</TE>

<LD>Damon Stoudamire practiced with the Portland Trail Blazers on
Tuesday, but didn't comment on a District Attorney's office
confirming that a grand jury will decide whether the point guard
should be charged with felony drug possession.</LD>
<LD>   The Clackamas County District Attorney's office confirmed Tuesday
that a grand jury will decide whether Stoudamire should be charged.</LD>
<LD>   The team said Stoudamire's attorney has advised him not to talk
about the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Stoudamire, 28, met Tuesday with Bob Whitsitt, team president and
general manager, who said Stoudamire feels badly about causing a
distraction before the playoffs. But Whitsitt added: "Damon's a big
part of what we're doing and will continue to be, and we're all
behind him and with him."</TE>
<TE>   KATU-TV in Portland first reported Monday that police had
forwarded Stoudamire's case to prosecutors last Friday after a search
at the player's home.</TE>

<LD>The protracted dispute over a drug test by a member of the U.S.
Olympic track team in Sydney, Australia will be decided in binding
arbitration.</LD>
<LD>   The case involves an unidentified American athlete who tested
positive for steroids but was allowed by USA Track &amp; Field to compete
in the Olympics after winning an appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. federation has been widely criticized for refusing to
release names of athletes who fail drug tests.</LD>
<TE>   Nick Davies, a spokesman for the International Association of
Athletics Federations, said Tuesday the IAAF and USATF had decided to
take the case to binding arbitration at the Court of Arbitration for
Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Davies said the two bodies decided to go jointly to arbitration
when they met during an IAAF council meeting last weekend.</TE>

<HD>Only a Cup Will Do for the Red Wings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Detroit Red Wings' collection of Hall of Famers fails to win
the Stanley Cup, it will be remembered for that disappointment rather
than its dominating regular season.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been saying all [season], if we don't win the Cup, it won't
be a successful year," Darren McCarty said. "This is what this team
was made for. This is what we'll be remembered for. Good or bad, it's
here."</LD>
<LD>   Detroit will begin its quest for the Stanley Cup tonight against
Vancouver in a best-of-seven first-round series.</LD>
<TE>   While the Red Wings say they're focused on the Canucks, who led
the league in goals and enter the playoffs on an 8-0-1 streak, others
wonder how Detroit will respond after almost lapping the competition
during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings, with an NHL-high 11 Olympians, won the President's
Cup with 116 points, at least 15 points more than the rest of the
league.</TE>
<TE>   They trailed only the Canucks in scoring without having a player
among the top 12 scorers and became the first team to have three
600-goal scorers, sometimes on the same line.</TE>
<TE>   They had an NHL-best 10-game home winning streak and won a
league-best eight straight games on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit proved it was as good in reality as it looked on
paper--quite an accomplishment alone--after its already-talented
roster was restocked last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings traded for goaltender Dominik Hasek, a six-time
Vezina Trophy winner and two-time most valuable player, and signed
two of the game's best all-time scorers: Brett Hull and Luc
Robitaille.</TE>
<TE>   When those three future Hall of Famers were added to the team's
other candidates--Steve Yzerman, Chris Chelios, Nicklas Lidstrom,
Sergei Fedorov, Brendan Shanahan and Igor Larionov--greatness was
expected, and it was delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding over the stars on ice is Scotty Bowman, hockey's
winningest coach, who has won eight Stanley Cups.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been looking forward to the playoffs all year, especially
when we were resting guys when the games didn't mean anything,"
Shanahan said. "We know as a team why we were put together. This team
was built for the playoffs, not just for the regular season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Flyers don't feel pressure. They're used to high
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always pressure in Philadelphia," forward Mark Recchi
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers open their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series
against Ottawa tonight. "Even though we struggled at the end, we
still expect big things."</TE>
<TE>   Despite winning only two of their last 10 games, the Flyers are
strong favorites to beat the Senators, who have won only one playoff
series in six chances.</TE>
<TE>   After trading Eric Lindros, spending $37.5 million on free agent
Jeremy Roenick and $45 million to re-sign John LeClair, management
made it clear another first-round failure won't be accepted.
Philadelphia has been eliminated in the first round in three of the
last four years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Maple Leaf backup goalie Tom Barrasso will sit out the
start of the playoffs because of a broken bone in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Panthers beat the Atlanta Thrashers and the Columbus
Blue Jackets, two teams with worse regular-season records, to win the
first pick in the June 22 draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington Capital goaltender Olaf Kolzig will sit out the world
championships because his knee is still sore and his son is
undergoing medical tests.</TE>
<TE>   The world championships will be held April 26-May 11 in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mighty Duck rookie center Andy McDonald has been added to the Team
Canada roster for the world championships.</TE>

Montreal Canadiens (36-31-12-3, 8th) vs. Boston
Bruins (43-24-6-9, 1st)
Schedule: Thu.; Sun.; Tue.; Apr. 25, 27*, 29*,
30* (*-if necessary, best of seven)
Season series: Boston, 3-2
Series preview: Montreal goaltender Jose
Theodore will have to be on top of his game to
hold off Boston's assortment of skilled players
such as Bill Guerin, Joe Thornton, Glen Murray
and Sergei Samsonov. In the five regular-season
games between the Northeast Division rivals,
the Bruins outshot the Canadiens, 182-110.
Boston goaltender Byron Dafoe will not get as
much work as Theodore, but he will be tested by
Montreal's forwards, headed by Yanic Perreault,
Doug Gilmour, Richard Zednik, Joe Juneau and
Sergei Berezin. The key to the series may be
the play of the Bruin defensemen. If they get
caught up in Boston's offense, the Canadiens
may be able to get some easy goals in
transition
Late-season acquisitions: Mon--left wing Bill
Lindsay; Bos--defensemen Jeff Norton and Sean
Brown, right wing Marty McInnis
Key injuries: None
Goaltenders' postseason records: Mon--Jose
Theodore (1-2); Bos-- Byron Dafoe (8-12)
Coaches' postseason records: Mon--Michel
Therrien (0-0-0); Bos--Robbie Ftorek (8-15-0)
Fast facts: The Bruins and Canadiens will meet
for a record 29th time in postseason play with
Montreal holding a 21-7 series advantage. Bruin
forward Brian Rolston led the NHL with nine
short-handed goals. The Canadiens are the only
playoff qualifier to have surrendered more
goals than they scored

Ottawa Senators (39-27-9-7, 7th) vs.
Philadelphia Flyers (42-27-10-3, 2nd)
Schedule: Tonight, Sat., Mon., April 24, 26*,
28*, 30* (*-if necessary, best of seven)
Season series: Ottawa, 2-1-1
Series preview: Could this be the season that
the Senators finally get it done in the
playoffs? Only if forwards Daniel Alfredsson,
Marian Hossa, Martin Havlat and Shawn
McEachern can create offense against the
Flyers' slow but physical defensemen such as
Luke Richardson, Chris Therien and Dan
McGillis. Philadelphia will get chances on
offense for forwards Jeremy Roenick, John
LeClair and Mark Recchi. The Flyers' biggest
questions will be their goaltending, with
Roman Cechmanek and Brian Boucher, along with
their power play, which finished the season
28th in the league at 13.2% (39 for 296)
Late-season acquisitions: Ott--left wing
Benoit Brunet, center Juha Ylonen; Phi--center
Adam Oates
Key injuries: Ott--none; Phi--defenseman Eric
Desjardins (back)
Goaltenders' postseason records: Ott--Patrick
Lalime (0-4); Phi-- Roman Cechmanek (2-4);
Brian Boucher (11-7)
Coaches' postseason records: Ott--Jacques
Martin (7-31); Phi--Bill Barber (2-4)
Fast facts: Only the Thrashers and the Mighty
Ducks had worse power plays than the Flyers
during the regular season. Philadelphia's 22
road wins tied a club record. The Senators
finished their games strong, leading the NHL
with 94 third-period goals

New Jersey Devils (41-28-9-4, 6th) vs.
Carolina Hurricanes (35-26-16-5, 3rd)
Schedule: Tonight, Fri., Sun., Tues., April
24*, 27*, 29* (*-if necessary, best of
seven)
Season series: New Jersey, 2-1-1
Series preview: Last season, Carolina gave
the Devils a tough time in the first round
of the playoffs before losing in six games.
Although the Hurricanes have home-ice
advantage, New Jersey will have an edge with
goaltender Martin Brodeur, who hasn't given
up more than three goals in a game since
Jan. 17. The Devils have won six in a row
over Carolina, which will need a big series
from veteran center Ron Francis. If the
Hurricanes can get Sami Kapanen and Jeff
O'Neill involved in the offense early, New
Jersey could have some problems
Late-season acquisitions: NJ--Center Joe
Nieuwendyk and right wings Jamie
Langenbrunner and Stephane Richer; Car--none
Key injuries: None
Goaltenders' postseason records: NJ--Martin
Brodeur (65-44); Car--Arturs Irbe (13-19)
Coaches' postseason records: Car--Paul
Maurice (4-8); NJ--Kevin Constantine (19-25)
Fast facts: The Hurricanes are tops in the
NHL in winning faceoffs, with all four
centers over 53%. The Devils scored only 205
goals this season, the worst among playoff
teams

New York Islanders (42-28-8-4, 5th) vs.
Toronto Maple Leafs (43-25-10-4, 4th)
Schedule: Thu., Sat., Tues., April 24, 26*,
28*, 30* (*-if necessary, best of seven)
Season series: New York, 3-1
Series preview: New York's Alexei Yashin will
have a chance to break out of his playoff
slump against a team that has made his life
miserable in the past. When Yashin played for
Ottawa, he struggled in playoff losses
against Toronto and forward Shayne Corson.
The Islanders need Mark Parrish and Michael
Peca to step up on offense to help Yashin.
The series may come down to which goaltender
plays the best. Toronto's Curtis Joseph may
be a little rusty after missing nearly two
months because of injury. New York's Chris
Osgood will be tested by the Maple Leafs'
Mats Sundin and Alexander Mogilny
Late-season acquisitions: NYI--Defenseman
Darren Van Impe; Tor--Goaltender Tom Barrasso
Key injuries: None
Goaltenders' postseason records: NYI--Chris
Osgood (38-25); Tor--Curtis Joseph (48-48)
Coaches' postseason records: NYI--Peter
Laviolette (0-0); Tor--Pat Quinn (143-75-68)
Fast facts: The Islanders enter the playoffs
having given up more goals than any other
playoff team. After winning only 21 games
last season, New York won 21 home and 21 road
games this season. Toronto got 48 goals from
their defensemen, the most in the NHL this
season

Vancouver Canucks (42-30-7-3, 8th) vs. Detroit
Red Wings (51-17-10-4, 1st)
Schedule: Tonight, Fri., Sun., Tues., April
25*, 27*, 29* (*-if necessary, best of seven)
Season series: Detroit, 3-1
Series preview: At first sight, this seems
like a mismatch. Detroit finished the regular
season with a league-high 116 points, while
Vancouver barely made the playoffs with 94.
The Red Wings won the season series, but a lot
has changed since the teams last met Jan. 10.
Detroit ended the season winless over its last
seven games. Vancouver finished on a nine-game
unbeaten streak. Behind Todd Bertuzzi and
Markus Naslund, the Canucks are big enough up
front to give the Red Wings problems. The Red
Wings may need goaltender Dominik Hasek to
carry them into the second round
Late-season acquisitions: Van--none;
Det--defenseman Jiri Slegr
Key injuries: Van--none; Det--left wing
Brendan Shanahan (wrist)
Goaltenders' postseason records: Van--Dan
Cloutier (0-2); Det--Dominik Hasek (37-32)
Coaches' postseason records: Van--Marc
Crawford (31-25, one Cup); Det--Scotty Bowman
(207-123, eight Cups)
Fast facts: Only 10 players in NHL history
have scored more than 600 goals in their
career, and the Red Wings have three of them:
Brett Hull, Luc Robitaille and Steve Yzerman.
Hull is the NHL's active leader in career
playoff goals. The Canucks haven't won a
playoff game since April 22, 1996

<TE>*--*
Kings (40-27-11-4, 7th) vs. Colorado Avalanche
(45-28-8-1, 2nd)
Schedule: Thu., Sat., Mon., Tue., April 25*,
27*, 29* (*-if necessary, best of seven)
Season series: Tied, 2-2
Series preview: The Avalanche needed seven
games to defeat the Kings in the second round
last year. Peter Forsberg is back, but
Colorado may have to go without injured
forward Milan Hejduk. Still, the Avalanche has
a lot of weapons. Joe Sakic always gives the
Kings fits and Rob Blake and Patrick Roy will
be motivated. Last year, the Kings entered the
playoffs on a roll and their confidence was a
key behind their impressive play. But that's
not the case this season; Los Angeles is
winless over its last six road games. The
Kings' top players did not show up in some
games, which they cannot afford to do against
the Avalanche
Late-season acquisitions: Kings--center Cliff
Ronning; Col--defenseman Darius Kasparaitis
Key injuries: Col--Milan Hejduk (groin).
Kings--none
Goaltenders' postseason records: Kings--Felix
Potvin (32-33); Col--Patrick Roy (137-80)
Coaches' postseason records: Kings--Andy
Murray (7-10); Col--Bob Hartley (38-21, one
cup)
Fast facts: The Kings ended the regular season
with an 11-game unbeaten streak at Staples
Center. Without Forsberg for the whole season,
Colorado scored only 212 goals to set a
franchise record for fewest in a season

Phoenix Coyotes (40-27-9-6, 6th) vs. San Jose
Sharks (44-27-8-3, 3rd)
Schedule: Tonight, Sat., Mon., April 24, 26*,
28*, 30* (*-if necessary, best of seven)
Season series: San Jose, 3-2
Series preview: The Sharks believe this is
the year they will go deep into the playoffs.
The Coyotes seem happy just to be in them. If
San Jose goaltender Evgeni Nabokov holds up,
the Sharks should be able to make this a
quick series. Phoenix needs its special teams
to dominate. Daniel Briere must score
power-play goals and the Coyote defense,
headed by captain Teppo Numminen, can't
afford penalty-killing breakdowns. San Jose's
biggest challenge will be dealing with the
pressure of expectations. The Sharks played
well in the playoffs as underdogs. Being a
heavy favorite is a change for them
Late-season acquisitions: None
Key injuries: Pho--center Mike Sullivan
(ribs); SJ--left wing Stephane Matteau (neck)
Goaltenders' postseason records: Pho--Sean
Burke (11-18); SJ--Evgeni Nabokov (1-3)
Coaches' postseason records: Pho--Bob Francis
(1-4) SJ--Darryl Sutter (22-34)
Fast facts: The Sharks have six 20-goal
scorers, the most of any team in the NHL this
season. San Jose is only the second team in
history to improve its point total for six
consecutive seasons. The Coyotes are tough on
home ice, where they're 12-0-0-1 in their
last 13

Chicago Blackhawks (41-27-13-1, 5th) vs. St.
Louis Blues (43-27-8-4, 4th)
Schedule: Thu., Sat., Sun., Tue., April 25*,
27*, 29* (*-if necessary, best of seven)
Season series: Chicago, 3-1-1
Series preview: St. Louis is one of the
toughest teams to figure out. When the Blues
are bad, they are really bad. But when they
are on top of their game, they are a difficult
team to beat. St. Louis begins the playoffs on
a roll, winning its final four games and eight
of 11. Doug Weight, Keith Tkachuk and Pavol
Demitra head an opportunistic attack, but the
Blues' biggest worry is whether Brent Johnson
will hold up in goal. The Blackhawks won the
season series but have shown some cracks late
in the season. Forwards Tony Amonte and Eric
Daze have to play well for Chicago to slow
down the Blues
Late-season acquisitions: Chi--defenseman Lyle
Odelein; right wing Tom Fitzgerald;
StL--center Ray Ferraro
Key injuries: Chi--none; StL--center Doug
Weight (knee)
Goaltenders' postseason records: Chi--Jocelyn
Thibault (3-9); StL--Brent Johnson (0-1)
Coaches' postseason records: Chi--Brian Sutter
(27-36); StL--Joel Quenneville (26-25)
Fast facts: The Blackhawks have the longest
current drought between Stanley Cups, 42
years. The Blues have been in the postseason
for 23 consecutive seasons

<HD>Three Homers for Berkman in Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lance Berkman became the first major leaguer this season to homer
three times in a game, driving in five runs as the Houston Astros hit
five home runs in beating the Reds, 8-3, Tuesday night at Cincinnati.</LD>
<LD>   "Tonight was a good night," Berkman said. "But the season's built
around singles and base hits. You can't always hit the ball out of
the ballpark."</LD>
<LD>   The first two Tuesday night were off starter Jose Acevedo, and
they cost Acevedo (2-1) his job. Acevedo was optioned to triple-A
Louisville after the game.</LD>
<TE>   "He left some pitches up and out over the plate," Berkman said.
"They were probably mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Berkman also had a solo homer in the fifth off Jose Rijo, breaking
a 24-inning scoreless streak by the Red bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, St. Louis 3--Although not at his overpowering best,
Randy Johnson was good enough to become baseball's first four-game
winner at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (4-0) gave up three runs--the total he'd given up combined
in his first three starts--and eight hits in seven innings. He struck
out five and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Counting his final 24 regular-season starts last season and six in
the postseason, Johnson is 25-3.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Atlanta 1--Braves' second baseman Marcus Giles
misplayed Rey Ordonez's sixth-inning grounder, allowing the
tiebreaking run to score at New York.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Braves made three errors, helping the Mets score two
unearned runs and beat their NL East rival for the fourth time in
five games. The Mets have won six of seven to move into the division
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta outfielder Gary Sheffield missed the game because of a
sore left wrist. He was hit by pitches twice Thursday at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 5, San Diego 1--Kirk Rueter held San Diego to three
hits in seven scoreless innings to give San Francisco's weary bullpen
a rest and Benito Santiago hit a two-run homer at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Padre Manager Bruce Bochy and first baseman Phil Nevin were
ejected in the bottom of the sixth for arguing a strike call, and
Nevin had to be restrained from going after umpire Mike Everitt.</TE>
<TE>   Rueter's solid effort came a night after the Giants' bullpen had
to work 71/3 innings in a 4-3 loss because Ryan Jensen retired only
two batters before leaving with a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Milwaukee 1--Jimmy Anderson gave up three hits in
seven innings and Brian Giles homered at Milwaukee as the Pirates
handed the Brewers their ninth loss in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh has won six road games in a row and is 8-5 start--the
Pirates' best start in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, Philadelphia 6--Preston Wilson's two-out single in the
bottom of the ninth inning scored Kevin Millar from second base at
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's second game-winning single in three games gave Florida
its first three-game win streak of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson beat Atlanta with a hit in the 14th inning on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 8, Chicago 4--Vladimir Guerrero homered twice and had
four runs batted in, including a run-scoring single to cap the Expos'
five-run fourth inning at Montreal.</TE>

<DH>Kings' Hopes Ride on Potvin, Who Shut Out Avalanche Twice
Last Year</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Murray once coached a goalie who would sit in the dressing room
between periods, motionless, with a towel covering his face.</LD>
<LD>   "I would walk past him and think, 'I've got to depend on this
guy?'" Murray recalled.</LD>
<LD>   Jamie Storr, the Kings' backup goalie, lies on the floor between
periods with legs up and eyes shut and hands swinging wildly as if
stopping hundreds of imaginary pucks.</LD>
<TE>   A veteran once looked down at him and said, "If they get that many
shots, we don't have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Cut through the 25 pounds of armor and endless choruses of bravado
and the average NHL goalie can be described in one word.</TE>
<TE>   Creepy.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it's either very reassuring--or very chilling--that
between periods, Felix Potvin does nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "He just sits there," said Murray, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't talk. Doesn't move.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows what he's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody is afraid to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I want to know," Ian Laperriere said.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping that for the man nicknamed "The Cat," those thoughts
have lately been of a different nature.</TE>
<TE>   Goose eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring he pitched consecutive shutouts in the playoffs
against the Colorado Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   This year, with a defense that has been struggling lately, he may
need to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in a brilliant postseason while leading the Kings to
within a game of the third round, he had a 2.44 goals-against
average.</TE>
<TE>   This year, it will need to be even better.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin cannot be blamed, actually, if he's thinking about only
bull's-eyes.</TE>
<TE>   There is a big one painted on his chest pads as the Kings begin
their Stanley Cup travels Thursday against the defending champion
Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "In the playoffs, you will only go as far as your goalie will take
you," Laperriere said.</TE>
<TE>   As goalies go, Potvin is a hot one.</TE>
<TE>   But his opponent is the downright face of the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin, meet Patrick Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you like it or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not playing against him, I'm playing against the forwards,"
Potvin said.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, right, whatever.</TE>
<TE>   We know about Roy, with his four Stanley Cups and 137 postseason
victories and interesting habit of talking to the goalposts.</TE>
<TE>   Do we know about Potvin, with no dishware and 32 postseason
victories?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what's going on inside his head, and I don't
even try to figure it out," Murray said. "I just know I want more
pucks to hit him than go behind him."</TE>
<TE>   Every goalie is an island. But Potvin is the sort upon which
Gilligan once lived.</TE>
<TE>   He's quiet, careful, distant.</TE>
<TE>   We know that when he was dumped here by Vancouver last season
after three consecutive lousy seasons, everyone thought he was
finished.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in a no-choice situation," admitted Murray.</TE>
<TE>   We know that Potvin then stunned everyone by regaining his Toronto
touch and leading them to a second-round seventh game against the
eventual champion Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   And we know that this season, he has pretty much done it again.</TE>
<TE>   With 71 games played this year, he broke the club record held by
Rogie Vachon.</TE>
<TE>   His 2.31 goals-against average is a career best, his six shutouts
equal a career high, and he teamed with Storr to form the sixth-most
effective goaltending group in the league.</TE>
<TE>   But what about now?</TE>
<TE>   A goalie can have a great regular season, but if he struggles in
the postseason, the stain is as dark as the ones that cover his
sweater.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Potvin's task is clearly more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Is he up for it?</TE>
<TE>   Murray can only guess.</TE>
<TE>   "I never say anything to Felix other than, 'How's your family
doing?'" Murray said. "I give him his space."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates can only guess.</TE>
<TE>   "Every goalie has got to be a little bit off in the head,"
Laperriere said.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin frowns. He says it's not that complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to win a Stanley Cup," he said. "I'm 30 years old
now. How many more chances like this am I going to get?"</TE>
<TE>   He said he's playing well because Murray makes it easy to play
well.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere here is good, because we're always so prepared,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he plays nearly every game--more than all but three other
NHL goalies, eight more than Roy--because that's his nature.</TE>
<TE>   "I have all summer to rest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Is he tired?</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   Is he sore?</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   Is he going to outplay Roy and lead the Kings to a second
consecutive first-round series upset?</TE>
<TE>   I think we all should just lie on the floor with our legs up and
our eyes shut and our hands swinging wildly until we find out.</TE>

<HD>No Doubts About It: Karros Has a New Fan</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>I wasn't there when Kirk Gibson hit his magical home run and have
regretted it ever since. So you can understand why I hopped an
airplane Tuesday and rushed to Coors Field to see Eric Karros in
uniform batting .302 before another game was played and I missed yet
another memorable moment in Dodger history.</LD>
<LD>   "Shocking, unbelievable, and in the month of April when you never
get a hit," I said when I got to him before the game, and he said,
"Is there a question there?"</LD>
<LD>   I thought of something Al Michaels had once said at a hockey game
to capture the general reaction to Karros' .302 batting average, but
the way the first baseman is swinging the bat these days I didn't
think he'd miss if he took exception.</LD>
<TE>   So I toned it down, and said something like, "How do you account
for the ball hitting your bat so often, you lucky stiff? Didn't some
people have you written off?"</TE>
<TE>   Karros grinned. "I owe it all to you," he said, and I must say
I've been doing my best to motivate him. "Six or seven years ago I
would have been really upset with some of the things written, and
would have come looking for you."</TE>
<TE>   I nodded, telling him as slow as he is today, maybe six years ago
with a running start he might've caught me, but it's out of the
question now.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get to me," Karros said, and I told him about Michael
Olowokandi saying the same thing a couple months ago after averaging
19.6 points on a Clipper trip, and then scoring two points in the two
games after our little chat.</TE>
<TE>   I congratulated him on vaulting to the fifth spot in the batting
order, and he grabbed his jersey from his locker, and said, "I had no
idea I was batting fifth, and of all the people to be the
messenger--it's you."</TE>
<TE>   As he finished buttoning his jersey, he realized he had put on his
game-time uniform when he was supposed to be pulling on his batting
practice top. "Give me credit for noticing it before you did," he
said, and he was laughing. "You just got me so excited to play the
game," that well, I got to him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A YEAR ago Karros batted .239 during April. He has a career
batting average of .259 in the first month of the season. He's a lot
worse in August--.207 last year and .248 for his career, and I'll be
sure to start reminding him of that early in June. But here we are on
April 16 with Karros not only batting above .300, but topping all the
Dodger regulars.</TE>
<TE>   "And you've only hit into one double play this season," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't blame me for the runner being thrown out at second
[after he struck out]," Karros said, and now he was the one doing the
teasing.</TE>
<TE>   I told him I'd be in the press box Tuesday night to mark the
occasion if this was going to be the only time all year he hit above
.300, or grounded into his first double play of the season, and he
said, "You can't get to me."</TE>
<TE>   In the second inning, Karros led off with a fly ball to right,
putting him at .295. Thank heavens my plane wasn't late.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PEOPLE TOLD me Karros is a good guy--political, smart and savvy,
but still a good guy. I wasn't sure, however, he could handle the
high hard ones from certain members of the media. My mistake. Tuesday
he took the test, and didn't blink. "If I'm healthy," he said, "no
matter what you say, I'll just prove you wrong."</TE>
<TE>   I suggested in my own way maybe he was too old to play effectively
anymore, not fast enough to beat an aging sportswriter in a race and
maybe he should consider changing his name legally to "6-4-3."</TE>
<TE>   He reacted like I was just joking. "I know there are a lot of
doubters, but I never doubted myself," he said, and I told him I
didn't buy that, and he said, "I take that back. At the end of last
season I had my doubts."</TE>
<TE>   He had back problems last year--and while it certainly wasn't from
carrying the team, he used the Lakers' therapist to get healthy
again, and voila, now we've got Joe DiMaggio. I wonder if the
therapist has time to see Shawn Green. Soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever it took to get better," Karros said. "If I had to climb
a mountain and stand on one leg, I'd have done it."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of climbing a mountain, I wondered if that's what it
feels like when he's running to first base. "I'm second on the team
right now in stolen bases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only 104 more and he'll break Maury Wills' Dodger mark, which will
be followed by a federal probe into record fixing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm older and wiser now [and you can't get to me]," Karros said,
and in the fourth inning he singled, boosting his average to .311.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   APPARENTLY IT'S the magic potion when someone tells Karros he
can't do something. He said people have doubted him since he was in
the minor leagues, and "I think things have gone pretty well," he
said, and hitting more home runs than any other Dodger in their L.A.
years is pretty good for a guy fighting to just make it.</TE>
<TE>   The secret, it seems, is to constantly tell Karros he can't do the
job, and if it will help, I'll do it for the team. In fact, I don't
think there's any way he can keep this up. After all, August is
coming.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get to me," Karros said, then singling in the sixth,
and again in the eighth to raise his average to .340. And I can say I
was there to see it, and now I wouldn't be surprised if he asks me to
join him at the ballpark more often.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Rachel:</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me you're not going to the Kings' playoff game; it's not
fair."</TE>
<TE>   I don't plan on missing a single pitch.</TE>

<LD>The United States team that takes the field against Ireland in Dublin
today probably will be close to the starting lineup Coach Bruce Arena
will send out against Portugal in Suwon, South Korea, on June 5 in
the Americans' opening game of the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Arena's probable lineup against Ireland features Brad Friedel in
goal behind a back line of Tony Sanneh, Gregg Berhalter, Eddie Pope
and Jeff Agoos.</LD>
<LD>   In midfield, Chris Armas will handle the defensive chores while
Claudio Reyna sets up the offense, flanked by Earnie Stewart on the
right and John O'Brien wide left.</LD>
<TE>   Clint Mathis, who has scored five goals in the last seven games,
and Brian McBride will be the forwards.</TE>
<TE>   The only question Tuesday was whether Agoos or Greg Vanney would
play at left back in place of David Regis, out because of a sprained
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland, which will play Cameroon, Germany and Saudi Arabia in the
first round of the World Cup, has not been beaten at home in almost
two years.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Coach Mick McCarthy is aware that the Americans could end
that streak.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the 13th-best team in the world, according to the [FIFA]
rankings, which is better than us," he told Reuters on Tuesday. The
Irish are ranked 18th.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has a much-improved team, compared to the last two times
we played them [3-1 and 2-1 U.S. victories in 1992 and 1996,
respectively], and when I first played them [a 1-1 tie in 1991].</TE>
<TE>   "Their players have gotten better, they're better organized. More
of them are playing in Europe for better teams, and that has improved
them collectively."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is 2-3-1 all-time against the Irish, having suffered all
three losses in Dublin.</TE>
<TE>   Arena's team is 7-2-1 this year, but has lost both times it has
played in Europe, 1-0 to Italy on Feb. 13 and 4-2 to Germany on March
27.</TE>
<TE>   The American starting lineups for those games were not as strong
as this one, however, and Arena expects to see improvement in the
team's final overseas game before the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to turn around that sloppy performance we had against
Germany," he said, in a way, contradicting something he had said last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "In the big scheme of things," he told an on-line chat show last
Thursday, "this result is not important. The significant results will
come June 5-14 in Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Before today's game, Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, and
Steve Staunton, a former Irish national team player, will present a
check for $264,100 to New York City fire fighters Kevin Gallagher and
Jack Ginty on behalf on victims of the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The money comes from the Irish players, who donated their fees
from a game against Denmark in March, from a collection taken among
fans at that game, and from the Irish soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   Denmark's soccer federation received a bomb threat, warning
against "a huge explosion" if today's game between Denmark and Israel
goes ahead as planned in Copenhagen.</TE>
<TE>   According to federation spokesman Lars Berendt, an anonymous
letter received late Monday and written in Danish stated that "both
spectators and the Danish World Cup players will be in danger." It
closed with the words, "Free Palestine." Because of the Mideast
crisis, extra security measure already had been put in place for the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Citing "new evidence," the Confederation of African Football (CAF)
Tuesday lifted a one-year ban that had been imposed on former
Cameroon goalkeeper Thomas Nkono after a bizarre scuffle with police
at the African Nations Cup in Mali in February.</TE>
<TE>   Nkono was Cameroon's goalkeeper at the 1982 and 1990 World Cups
and is now his country's goalkeeping coach. Before a semifinal
against the host nation, he was dragged from the field, kicking and
screaming, his track suit pants around his ankles, by policeman, who
accused him of dropping "magic" on the field.</TE>
<TE>   A CAF spokesman later said that Nkono had not been wearing the
proper accreditation, and that that, not witchcraft, had been the
reason for his expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Gil, the controversial president of Atletico Madrid and
mayor of the Mediterranean resort of Marbella, was sent to prison by
a Spanish high court judge Tuesday in an anti-corruption crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had charged Gil with appropriating $26.4 million in
municipal funds for his own and the club's use. Two weeks ago, the
high court barred Gil from holding public office for 28 years for
breach of trust and influence-peddling. That sentence is under
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   England's Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson named Liverpool striker
Michael Owen, 22, captain for today's warmup against Paraguay in
place of the injured David Beckham, but said he expects Beckham to
have recovered in time to reclaim his position.</TE>
<TE>   "For the World Cup, I refuse today to think that Beckham is not
there, so I have never thought about who is going to be the captain
against Sweden on June 2," Eriksson said.</TE>
<TE>   Striker El Hadji Ousseynou Diouf, who helped lead Senegal to its
first World Cup, was named African Footballer of the Year over Samuel
Osei Kuffour of Ghana.</TE>

<HD>Texans Not Playing the Rushing Game</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Expansion team doesn't expect to be
competitive yet, but odds seem to be in Houston's favor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Carolina Panthers reached the NFC championship game in their
second year of existence ... and haven't had a winning season since.</LD>
<LD>   The Jacksonville Jaguars made the playoffs four of their first
five seasons ... and wound up with crippling salary-cap problems.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion Cleveland Browns made their debut before a delirious
crowd of 72,000 that chanted "Cleveland Rocks!" ... and collected two
first downs in a 43-0 loss to Pittsburgh. They lost 27 of their next
32 games before finishing last season 7-9.</LD>
<TE>   The Houston Texans are off to a bold start--they were putting the
finishing touches on a deal Tuesday with Fresno State quarterback
David Carr, who will be the No. 1 pick in this weekend's NFL
draft--and time will tell if their plan works.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, we'll look like a football team," General Manager
Charley Casserly said. "I'm just not sure when."</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder, then, why Texan owner Bob McNair shies away from
making rash predictions about what the immediate future holds.</TE>
<TE>   "By the third year," he said, "we want to be competitive."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people around the league think the Texans will be
competitive right away. The franchise made out nicely at the
expansion draft in February, picking up several standout players,
including one of the league's best offensive tackles, Jacksonville's
Tony Boselli; linebacker Jamie Sharper and receiver Jermaine Lewis,
both standouts in Baltimore; and the New York Jets' starting
cornerback tandem of Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans have 14 picks in the two-day draft, including the No. 1
selection, two picks in the second through sixth rounds--one at the
beginning of each round, the other in the middle--and three in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Many around the league think Houston is in a far better position
than Carolina, Jacksonville and Cleveland were during their inaugural
seasons. Among the reasons:</TE>
<TE>   * More talent in the expansion draft: Because so many teams were
hamstrung by the salary cap, and letting big-money players go in the
expansion draft provided a quick-fix solution, the draft was loaded
with talented players in the prime of their careers. The Texans made
the most of that, selecting 19 players--all in their 20s--who could
make an immediate impact.</TE>
<TE>   First on that list was Boselli, the former USC standout who has
been to five Pro Bowls and is also a quality citizen, a stabilizing
influence on a young team.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony Boselli is a Hall of Famer," Casserly said at the time. "We
have our first Hall of Famer and we haven't even played a game yet."</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville, the team the star tackle left, also benefited
greatly. Three players were taken off their list--Boselli, and
defensive tackles Seth Payne and Gary Walker--representing $17
million in salary cap space. The Jaguars also saved $14 million when
the contracts of linebacker Kevin Hardy and defensive end Renaldo
Wynn expired in February. All of a sudden, the team that was a record
$38 million over the cap a year ago, and $28 million over before the
expansion draft, was a comfortable $3 million under it.</TE>
<TE>   When the league staged an expansion draft for Cleveland, fewer
teams were saddled with a cap crunch, so the caliber of available
talent was much lower. The only legitimate starter the Browns
selected was their first pick, center Jim Pyne.</TE>
<TE>   They did miss on a couple of quarterbacks, however. St. Louis left
Kurt Warner exposed--no one dreamed how good he would become--and
Minnesota was ready to let Jay Fiedler go.</TE>
<TE>   * Plenty of time to prepare. McNair bought the franchise for $700
million in 1999, so he has had ample time to put the pieces in place.
Casserly, the former Redskin general manager, has had more than a
year in his current position to scout players, hire coaches and iron
out the wrinkles. From the time the franchise was awarded until their
inaugural kickoff, the Texans will have have 35 months to prepare,
nearly three times as long as Cleveland (one year). Carolina had 23
months and Jacksonville had 22 months of ramp-up time..</TE>
<TE>   "Cleveland was quite hectic," recalled Joe Mack, whom the league
appointed as the Browns' interim director of player personnel before
the franchise had a management structure in place. "Everybody
performed really well, considering the circumstances. Everyone did
the best they could."</TE>
<TE>   Mack, who earlier worked as assistant GM under Bill Polian in
Carolina, had to get the Cleveland franchise up and running six
months before the Browns even had an owner. For the first two months,
he was a staff of one.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time, there really wasn't anyone to talk football with
around here," he told Sports Illustrated in May, 1998. "The only
discussions going on in this building were between me and my stomach
about what to order on my pizza."</TE>
<TE>   * There's no substitute for experience. The Texans are coached by
Dom Capers, who coached in Carolina for the Panthers' first four
seasons. His offensive coordinator in Houston is Chris Palmer,
Cleveland's former coach. Both are very familiar with the challenges
and pitfalls of building a franchise from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who served as offensive coordinator on Tom Coughlin's
staff in Jacksonville in 1997 and '98, is particularly adept at
working with young quarterbacks. He helped groom Drew Bledsoe in New
England, Mark Brunell in Jacksonville and Tim Couch in Cleveland. He
now will turn his attention to Carr.</TE>
<TE>   Capers was part of a Carolina franchise that was off to a record
pace in its first two seasons. The Panthers signed established
defensive players--many in their 30s--and concentrated largely on
building an offense through the draft. The philosophy was the defense
would set the tone for the first few seasons, allowing the young
offense to develop and catch up.</TE>
<TE>   The plan worked beautifully the first two seasons, when the
Panthers overcame an 0-5 start to win 20 of their next 29 games. In
1996, they won the NFC West with a 12-4 record and came one game shy
of reaching the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Then, things unraveled. Quarterback Kerry Collins struggled with
alcohol problems, made racial comments that nearly tore apart the
team, and eventually quit. (He later resurfaced and reached the Super
Bowl with the New York Giants.) Star linebacker Kevin Greene staged a
damaging contract holdout. Receiver Rae Carruth wound up in prison
for murder. The Panthers overspent on players and got in trouble with
the cap. Basically, everything fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 38 players they drafted from 1995 through '98, only four
remain on the roster--two starters. Last season, the Panthers
finished 1-15.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't handle success very well," Capers said. "Maybe it came
too easy. Maybe we thought it was a little too easy. In the third
year, reality set in. We were the hunter the first two years, and we
became the hunted in the third year."</TE>
<TE>   * There's no place like home. Casserly is convinced the money
McNair and the city have spent on state-of-the-art facilities will
not only help the team this season but will convince free agents to
join the Texans in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Our plan when we came into this was, the No. 1 thing we have to
do is build the best facility in football," Casserly said. "If
players come here and see the best facility in football, they know we
plan to win here."</TE>
<TE>   The Texans will play in the league's only retractable-roof
stadium, a glistening $400-million palace with a gigantic wall of
windows that overlooks the city. More than half of Reliant Stadium is
glass. On a clear day, spectators will be able to see for miles.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Texans, they are keeping their eyes open too. After
all, they want to chart a road map all future expansion teams will
try to follow. They don't want to wind up another cautionary tale.</TE>

<HD>Bruin Gymnasts Aim for Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA isn't shy about its role as favorite in the NCAA women's
gymnastics national championship meet, which begins Thursday at
Tuscaloosa, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   "If every team goes out there and hits [their performances], we
should win," sophomore Jamie Dantzscher said. "I'm not being
arrogant, it's just that we've got so much depth and so many good
gymnasts."</LD>
<LD>   UCLA, the two-time defending champion, has won three titles since
the NCAA began sponsoring the women's nationals in 1982. Utah,
Georgia and Alabama are the only other teams that have won.</LD>
<TE>   It was during a loss to Alabama last month in a meet at Tuscaloosa
that UCLA probably best illustrated why it is favored to win its
third consecutive team title. Competing without Dantzscher and Onnie
Willis, their top gymnasts, the Bruins lost, 197.650 to 197.000.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was smart that we went out there," UCLA Coach Valorie
Kondos Field said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't compete a few of our top athletes, but I think we
shocked a lot of people. A lot of our athletes got some great
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Willis and Dantzscher will compete in the nationals. Willis shared
last year's NCAA all-around title with Michigan's Elise Ray.
Dantzscher, a 2000 U.S. Olympian, had seven consecutive perfect 10
scores on the floor exercise this season and is expected to contend
in the all-around.</TE>
<TE>   Kondos Field, in her 12th year as UCLA's coach, is a former
professional ballet dancer who never competed in gymnastics. She
encourages her athletes to focus on their performances rather than on
winning.</TE>
<TE>   "When I performed, I didn't have someone telling me whether I won
or lost," she said. "[Gymnastics] is a subjective sport. You can have
the greatest performance of your life but your score may not reflect
that because a judge may not give you a score you thought you would
get. I would never determine our success on one event."</TE>
<TE>   Dantzscher said she appreciates Kondos Field's approach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good balance," she said. "We have Steve [Gerlach] and Milo
[Johnson] who are phenomenal coaches technically.</TE>
<TE>   "[Valorie] knows gymnastics because she's been here for a while.
She knows what to say before we compete to make us feel confident
when we go out there."</TE>
<TE>   After winning the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation men's
volleyball championship, top-ranked Pepperdine (25-4) earned the top
seed in the conference tournament and will play host to No. 8 Cal
State Northridge in a first-round match Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches Saturday, No. 3 UCLA (25-6) will play host to No.
6 UC Santa Barbara (17-10), No. 7 Long Beach State (13-17) plays at
No. 2 Hawaii (20-7) and No. 5 Stanford (16-9) is at No. 4 Brigham
Young (22-6).</TE>
<TE>   The highest remaining seed out of the first round will play host
to the semifinals April 25 and the MPSF title match April 27.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ellen Murchison retired Monday as Cal State Fullerton women's
volleyball coach after 10 seasons, a move prompted at least partially
by her health.</TE>
<TE>   She has survived two episodes of breast cancer since being
diagnosed in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Zimmerman, an assistant to Murchison the last seven years,
has been appointed interim coach. Murchison's teams at Fullerton went
76-211 overall. The Titans were 8-18, and 4-14 in the Big West
Conference last season.</TE>
<TE>   USC (6-22) finished its men's volleyball season with a 30-27,
35-37, 30-28, 30-25 victory over Pacific. Senior Brook Billings had a
season-high 36 kills to help the Trojans end a school-record 11-match
losing streak....Golfer Mikaela Parmlid of USC won the Peg Bernard
California Challenge at Stanford with a one-under-par 143 for 36
holes. The Trojans took third place behind Washington and Cal. UCLA
was in a tie for eighth.... Kelley Carlson of Northridge shot 152 for
36 holes to win individual medalist honors in the Matador Spring
Classic at Knollwood Country Club in Granada Hills.... UC Irvine's
Walailak Satarak and Stella Lee each shot two-under 214 for 54 holes
to tie for the individual title and help the Anteaters win the BYU
Dixie Classic last week at St. George, Utah.</TE>

<HD>Molina's Pool Is Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Codes: Officials are investigating whether the county
supervisor and her spouse had a permit and installed required safety
equipment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles building officials, who allowed county Supervisor Gloria
Molina and her husband to skirt building codes on a retaining wall at
their house, said they are now investigating whether the couple broke
the law by building a swimming pool there without a permit and
without installing required safety equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Building and Safety Department spokesman Robert Steinbach said the
investigation began after the department was questioned by a Los
Angeles Times reporter, who spotted the pool while covering a story
that appeared Sunday about the disputed retaining wall at the
hillside house in Mount Washington owned by Molina and her husband,
Ronald L. Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   City property records available to the public show no permits for
the pool. Steinbach said the department was unaware of it until
contacted by a reporter.</LD>
<TE>   But Martinez said city officials have known of the pool since it
was built in 2001, and that he received a city electrical permit for
it.</TE>
<TE>   Building and safety department officials "signed off on
everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said it would have been illegal for Molina to build the
pool without a permit if it is larger than 250 square feet and more
than 2 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said the department has not been able to determine the
size of the pool from a photograph that appeared in Sunday's editions
of The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The pool also apparently lacks a fence to keep children out, which
is required if it is deeper than 18 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Molina has declined to comment on the permit squabble. Martinez
said Tuesday that he did not apply for building and mechanical
permits for the pool because his pool contractor told him they were
not required.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said city inspectors who visited his house to inspect
other remodeling work saw his pool and never mentioned that it might
be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's right there in the frontyard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An official at the department's code enforcement bureau also
acknowledged that a complaint about the pool, made by an undisclosed
person, is in the department's file.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Building Inspector Bill King did not allow a reporter who
visited the office in which the file is kept to view the complaint,
and referred the reporter to Steinbach.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach refused to let the reporter see the file, saying it
could compromise the department's investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The reporter and Times Deputy General Counsel Karlene Goller told
Steinbach the information must be released under state public-records
laws, but Steinbach disagreed and referred the reporter to the city
attorney's public information office.</TE>
<TE>   City attorney spokeswoman Mary McGuire said that during an
investigation, a department can require a written request for
documents so that it can confer with attorneys before allowing the
documents to be viewed.</TE>
<TE>   Retaining Wall Disputed for Years</TE>
<TE>   The pool is in a yard that is supported by the disputed retaining
wall. For years, city inspectors contended that the wall, which holds
back dirt poured onto the hillside to form the yard, was in danger of
failing and needed repairs. But last year, top department officials
allowed the wall to remain unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   They have never collected $3,710 in resulting fines and fees from
Molina and Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said he believed he did not have to pay the fines because
he had resolved his dispute with the city over the wall. "It's their
duty to collect fines, not mine. It was a noncompliance fee, and I
was never noncompliant," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire said notices regarding the fees were sent to Martinez in
November 1997 and January 1998. McGuire said the city attorney's
office also met with Alan Pinel, Martinez's attorney, in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   She said Pinel and the city attorney's office agreed at that time
that Martinez would pay $1,500. McGuire said that amount was never
paid.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire said the money can no longer be collected because the
statute of limitations has expired. She said statutory fees assessed
by the city must be collected in three years, and the city's fees
were levied in April 1997.</TE>

<HD>Ports to Require Photo IDs</HD>
<DH>Security: L.A. mayor's task force, created after the Sept.
11 attacks, develops the plan after six months of effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After six months of effort, Mayor James K. Hahn's task force on
waterfront security has devised a plan to protect the nation's
busiest port complex: Port visitors will have to show a valid photo
ID, such as a driver's license.</LD>
<LD>   The system, to be implemented May 1, will not include the
background checks on all dockworkers and truck drivers that Hahn
called for shortly after Sept. 11 as part of a plan to protect the
seaport from terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Some people are going to be disappointed" with the plan, said
Capt. J.M. Holmes, commanding officer of the U.S. Coast Guard at the
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and a member of the mayor's task
force.</LD>
<TE>   "But it's an important first step in changing the culture of our
ports, which right now are vulnerable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we ever going to be getting a formal port-wide identification
system? Yes. Eventually," Holmes said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was unavailable for comment. But Troy Edwards, deputy mayor
for special projects, said, "The mayor is very, very disappointed.
This is not what Mayor Hahn envisioned. He expected the stakeholders
to work together on an identification system with real teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor thinks the task force and U.S. Coast Guard should be
further along than they are now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But this matter is not over," Edwards said. "They have to
redouble their efforts, bear down, come up with an agreement and
implement it."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn assembled the 18-member task force in October to develop a
comprehensive system to upgrade security at the adjacent ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach, which together handle about 5,000 vessels a
year ferrying cargo valued at $200 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece was to be a foolproof method to confirm the
identities of the 25,000 people who do business at the ports each
day.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern are the thousands of trucks owned by mostly
independent drivers who haul nearly 5 million containers a year from
the harbor to train yards 20 miles to the north and retail outlets
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities must know, Hahn demanded last fall, "who the drivers
are, what they are bringing into the ports and where it came from."</TE>
<TE>   Although Congress already was struggling to craft legislation on
criminal background checks for waterfront workers, the task force
hoped to be the first to forge procedures that would become a
national model.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, however, conflicts over turf and politics
emerged among groups that have long been at odds. Unions and
employers could not agree. Neither could the cities and ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach. Local, state and federal agencies had
differing agendas. And shipping and railroad companies wondered who
would pay for it all.</TE>
<TE>   The task force has yet to reach a consensus on two fundamental
questions: Who will pay for a proposed identification system that
will cost about $25 million to implement? Who will control its
databases?</TE>
<TE>   The panel's members also have tangled on a range of other issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Port of Long Beach, for example, takes exception to Hahn's
demands that Port of Los Angeles officials hammer out local security
measures while Congress is working on a program that would apply to
all ports nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We're reluctant to put something in place only to have it
superseded by a federal plan later," said Fausto Capobianco,
spokesman for the Port of Long Beach. "We think that's bad business."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the powerful International Longshore and Warehouse
Union, which is represented on the task force, opposes background
checks as violations of privacy that could lead to dismissals of
people who have worked on the docks for decades with spotless
employment records.</TE>
<TE>   'Failure Is Not an Option'</TE>
<TE>   As if all that were not enough, task force members hesitate to
make any changes that might slow commerce at the harbor, which
supplies the Chicago area alone with 60% of its imported goods.</TE>
<TE>   "One mistake on our part could affect the economy of the entire
nation--failure is not an option," Holmes said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be known as the guy who forced closure of an auto
plant in Ohio," Holmes said.</TE>
<TE>   Facing continued gridlock, and fearing complacency if action isn't
taken soon, the task force has decided to "do something we could all
agree on," said Los Angeles Port Police Chief Noel Cunningham.</TE>
<TE>   "Reaching this point has been a very, very difficult and
complicated process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to move ahead in phases, doing the simple things
first," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under "phase one," all port workers and truck drivers will have to
show a valid photo ID at existing checkpoints to labor near volatile
and toxic materials, cargo vessels and military equipment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the port police will be expanded by about 25% to
roughly 70 officers, and a consulting firm will be hired to
determine, among other things, the extent of the background checks
that might be administered at some future date under "phase two."</TE>
<TE>   "We will be conducting background checks on some people working on
or near the most sensitive locations," Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it would not be necessary or practical, and could hurt
relationships between union workers and their employers, if everybody
got them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to keep Big Brother from prescribing a program that won't
work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor Commission President Nick Tonsich, who was appointed by
Hahn, predicted that eventually, "as we move along with phase two,
all of the mayor's goals will be achieved."</TE>
<TE>   Role of the Port Police</TE>
<TE>   "Phase two will kick in once we reach a consensus over who will be
in charge of the security system," Tonsich said.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be more economical to let the Los Angeles Port Police do
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the competitive dynamics of port matters, no one can say if
even that plan would be amenable to all stakeholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I like to see these security matters move faster? Yeah,"
Holmes said. "Can we move more quickly on them? Nope."</TE>

<HD>Priest Sent to Therapy Is Accused of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Religion: A 34-year-old man alleges he was molested by
clergyman who failed to comply with church-ordered treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER, RICHARD WINTON and GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 34-year-old West Hollywood man reported Tuesday to the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department that he had been molested from 1976 to
1986 by a priest who Cardinal Roger M. Mahony said failed to comply
with a church-ordered therapy program.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whose name is being withheld by The Times, claimed he was
abused repeatedly by Father Michael Baker, beginning when he was 9 at
St. Paul of the Cross Church in La Mirada. "Father Mike did this to
me, and he did it to others and needs to answer for his crimes," the
man said.</LD>
<LD>   Baker, 54, is one of several former priests whose names were
recently turned over by church officials to Los Angeles Police
Department investigators.</LD>
<TE>   Baker left the priesthood two years ago and agreed to pay a
portion of a $1.3-million settlement to the family of one victim,
according to sources familiar with the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who refused to discuss the specifics of Baker's case, said
in an interview the former priest is among a small group that
"troubles me the most," men who have left the archdiocese and are
living without any supervision.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Baker said he could not comment
on the allegations or Mahony's characterization of him. "I have some
feelings of response and clarification ... but I don't think I can
really comment on them right now. I have been advised not to," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker began years of counseling in the mid-1980s after the
archdiocese learned of alleged child abuse, according to sources
knowledgeable about Baker's treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our evidence showed that he was never really complying
with any therapy program and therefore there was never any
cooperation of any kind," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience of many in dealing with him was they questioned
the truthfulness of what he said."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony is under increasing pressure to reveal the names of priests
who have been fired over child abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley sent the cardinal a letter
warning of a grand jury investigation unless law enforcement agencies
receive assurances that the archdiocese is disclosing everything it
knows about the abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Says Publicity Fuels Abuse Allegations</TE>
<TE>   Baker's attorney, Don Steier, declined to discuss the allegations.
He cautioned that many priests have been accused of wrongdoing in
recent months, citing the unsupported claim by a Fresno woman that
she had been abused by Mahony in 1970. Police in Fresno concluded
there was no evidence to support the claim.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me that there will be allegations made
against priests or even the cardinal based upon the amount of
publicity that is currently being generated," Steier said. "And
ultimately, we will examine each case individually and determine the
validity of the allegations. We've already seen that the allegations
involving the cardinal were not meritorious."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey R. Anderson, an attorney for the West Hollywood man, said
he sent a fax to Mahony on Tuesday notifying him of the allegations
and asking whether any other claims of sexual misconduct have been
lodged against Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who represents dozens of alleged victims of pedophile
priests across the country, said his client "is credible, he is
earnest, and he is in a place where for the first time he could break
his silence.... I told him you could put your head in the pillow
tonight knowing you've done everything you can to make sure this kind
of abuse doesn't happen to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, Mahony assigned Baker to work with retired
priests and to occasionally help with Sunday masses at various
parishes. He was not allowed to work with children.</TE>
<TE>   The man who reported the allegations to Sheriff's investigators
claimed Baker would arrange to have him spend the night at St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "It started off very subtly. I'd be in bed with him and gradually
it progressed," the man said. "I started staying up there once every
couple of weekends."</TE>
<TE>   Baker, he said, took him to a home in Palm Desert, to Balboa
Island and on a trip to Chicago, where he allegedly molested him.
Baker, he said, lived lavishly for a priest and occasionally brought
the man's mother and father on trips to Palm Desert.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very charismatic guy. He befriended everyone," the man
said.</TE>
<TE>   Accuser Says Priest Gave Him Money</TE>
<TE>   Baker sometimes showed remorse, he said, and would "leave money on
the bed in the morning. I have a letter somewhere from him, after the
fact, that he was sorry for everything."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, the man said, he told a therapist about the
molestations. He said the therapist reported them to police but
nothing came of it except a single call to his mother, the man said.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1990 or 1991, he said, he confronted Baker. He said for
several years he occasionally received money in the mail from Baker.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Archdiocese is one of several ministries around the
country dealing with clerical sex abuse accusations, some decades
old.</TE>
<TE>   In Cooley's letter, sent last week and obtained Tuesday, he said
recent disclosures had raised serious questions about compliance by
church officials with the state law that requires clergy members to
report child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Your personal assurance that all known or reasonably suspected
instances of child abuse have been reported by the archdiocese to the
appropriate law enforcement agencies is essential," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said if the archdiocese fails to comply, "formal
investigation through the Los Angeles County Grand Jury may become
necessary."</TE>
<TE>   In a reply received by Cooley this week, Mahony said his clergy
are trained to comply with the law and that no information was being
withheld. Mahony also provided details on four active cases, three
involving priests and one allegation against a deacon.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley on Tuesday sent another letter to Los Angeles Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and Larry
Lewis, president of the L.A. County Police Chiefs' Assn., requesting
that they review the cardinal's reply to see whether archdiocese
officials are complying with the state reporting law.</TE>
<TE>   "A complete investigation to determine if there have been
violations of mandatory child abuse reporting laws or any criminal
child abuse laws by persons associated with the Los Angeles
archdiocese is essential," Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony told Cooley his attorneys know of four active criminal
cases in the L.A. archdiocese: an ousted priest in Bell Gardens, a
South El Monte deacon who pleaded guilty to felony sex crimes, a
priest under investigation for allegedly abusing altar servers and
another former priest accused of pinching a girl on the buttocks.</TE>

<HD>City Hall Bad News for TV Crews</HD>
<DH>Media: Restoration left out things like needed video lines,
lighting and special parking access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The place looks as good as new. But they may have trouble showing off
City Hall's new $300-million makeover, Los Angeles officials
discovered Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Television crews descending en masse on the 74-year-old landmark
for the first time since its reopening discovered that restoring the
place to its 1928 glory has meant eliminating a few high-tech
additions--like the video line used to broadcast City Council
meetings, TV lights in the mayor's media conference room and parking
space for TV trucks.</LD>
<LD>   A dozen local TV crews showed up at the downtown Civic Center to
report on Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' appearance before the City
Council. Coming three days before the official rededication of City
Hall, the unusual council proceeding was the first major event at the
building since its five-year closure for a seismic retrofit and
refurbishing.</LD>
<TE>   But before they could set up their cameras, broadcast stations had
to beg for temporary permission to park satellite trucks and
microwave news vans near City Hall. Then they had to string
600-foot-long cables through City Hall windows to reach the gleaming,
newly refurbished council chambers. Inside the mayor's office, they
found their TV lights missing.</TE>
<TE>   TV technicians discovered that the designated news van parking
area on 1st Street was out of range of the stations' microwave
receivers on Mt. Wilson, a mile above Pasadena. So they were forced
to bounce the signals off the walls of nearby office buildings or
rent $8-per-minute satellite time in order to air Parks' presentation
to the council.</TE>
<TE>   "The city General Services Department believes aesthetics are more
important than television news coverage," shrugged Hans Laetz, a news
assignment editor at KTLA-TV (Channel 5), who unsuccessfully sought
permission for news vans to park on the Spring Street sidewalk
outside City Hall, as the trucks did before the renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Their first answer was, 'No, you can't park on the sidewalk. It's
dangerous and it doesn't look good.' But safety is not a problem.
News trucks have been parking on that sidewalk for 50 years and never
hit a pedestrian," Laetz said.</TE>
<TE>   The missing video cable had linked the council chambers with a TV
van junction box next to the Spring Street sidewalk. From there, news
trucks had a straight shot at Mt. Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize you really have to be in the right spot to
get a picture out," said David Gregory, whose KCBS-TV (Channel 2) van
was on 1st Street.</TE>
<TE>   David Seger, supervisor of electronic journalism field operations
for KNBC-TV (Channel 4), spent two hours stringing his station's
cable out a council chambers window and installing amplifiers needed
to beef up the video signal strength from the 600-foot line.</TE>
<TE>   KCAL-TV (Channel 9) cameraman Ron Price said TV lights used to
professionally illuminate the mayor's media room were victims of the
City Hall project. Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for Mayor James K. Hahn,
said the lights apparently did not fit with the architectural
preservation.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kindred, a reporter for KFWB radio (980 AM) who works with
the local Radio and Television News Assn., said David Gershwin, an
aide to Council President Alex Padilla, was able at least to wrangle
two-day parking permits.</TE>
<TE>   Tony De Clue, assistant general manager of the city's General
Services Department, said officials are willing to work with TV
crews. But he warned that parking on the sidewalk may be a thing of
the past.</TE>
<TE>   Public access to government may be a thing of the past too, said
cameraman Stephen Coleman of KABC-TV (Channel 7). He blamed the
parking problem on authorities' reaction to the Sept.11 terrorism
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no street parking left anywhere near the Civic Center.
It's becoming an insular government. It's coming to the point [where]
there is no access unless you spend $12 to park at a lot blocks
away," Coleman said.</TE>

beach, and what do you have?</LD>
<LD>   If you guessed a rowdy, debauched weekend, try again. On this
occasion, it was a serious-minded academic retreat focusing on
political violence--one of the latest offerings in a program to
energize and expand USC's intellectual life for undergraduates.</LD>
<LD>   The notion of undergraduate intellectual life at USC once could
have been a punch line for a joke told by a UCLA booster, but these
days it's regarded as a serious matter on the campus just south of
downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Through a program known as the academic culture initiative, USC
hopes to foster more informal out-of-class exchanges between
professors and undergraduates. The university also is trying to spur
more intellectual give-and-take among students.</TE>
<TE>   For students, the main message is "that much of their learning
will take place outside of the classroom," said Mark E. Kann, head of
USC's political science department and director of the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   To make that kind of learning happen, the initiative has
subsidized faculty to host dinners for students in their homes or at
restaurants. It also has launched book discussion groups, and has
sponsored student-faculty get-togethers featuring performances and
talks on poetry, jazz and filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the initiative also offered the voluntary
weekend academic retreat on political violence at a hotel overlooking
a marina in Oxnard. As boats glided by outside the conference room,
the students' eyes--and minds--appeared tightly focused on the
discussion topics.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the attendees were an especially dedicated group. The
weekend program, like most other academic culture initiative
offerings, wasn't part of a formal course and didn't provide any
academic credit.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here is here by choice," said Suzanne Taylor, an
occupational therapy major in her junior year, following a Saturday
night session that went past 9 o'clock. For learning, she said, "it's
the best environment."</TE>
<TE>   Robin Romans, director of USC's main undergraduate honors program,
who once helped organize a conference on anarchy, acknowledges that
he is diving into irony again in his work with the academic culture
initiative. The goal, he said, is to create "a sense of informality
through a formal process."</TE>
<TE>   But, Romans said, that approach probably is what it will take to
firmly establish richer intellectual traditions on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Students and faculty alike say they have noticed a general trend
toward extracurricular intellectual and cultural pursuits at USC in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Liliana Loofbourow, a student who last month received one of the
Phi Beta Kappa awards that USC gives annually to two top-ranking
seniors, said she was disappointed that here was no campus literary
magazine when she arrived as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   Loofbourow decided to help launch one, even though campus
administrators were reluctant to provide financial backing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   These days, she said, an array of campus administrators and
programs, including the academic culture initiative, provide support
for the journal, Palaver.</TE>
<TE>   Loofbourow said other literary and arts-related activities also
are on the upswing. Still, she said, there's room for improvement.
Loofbourow--a triple major in psychobiology, music and English--said
the school could do a better job of bringing together people from
different departments and of spreading the word about cultural
programs on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an absolutely phenomenal music school," she said. "And it
breaks my heart that I go to see my friends' recitals, and there are
[just] 12 people there in the audience. It seems to me that there's
still a problem with disseminating information."</TE>
<TE>   Romans agreed that attendance at special events sometimes falls
short. When his honors program, with the help of the academic culture
initiative, started offering regular book "salons" for
undergraduates, some of the nine initial groups filled all their 12
slots, but a few groups had vacancies and one had just five students.</TE>
<TE>   All the same, Romans said the academic culture initiative has made
"very promising first steps."</TE>
<TE>   The recent weekend retreat at the Casa Sirena Hotel &amp; Marina in
Oxnard was run as a pilot project. Kann said he had no idea how many
students it might draw.</TE>
<TE>   To fill the 50 slots for undergraduates, the organizers advertised
in the campus daily newspaper, and fired off e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   The cost to students--including the hotel room, three meals and a
round-trip bus ride--was just $20. USC subsidized the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Other incentives included the two professors leading the
discussions, both winners of multiple teaching awards: Kann, and
Steven L. Lamy, director of USC's School of International Relations.</TE>
<TE>   At USC, "lots of people talk about these guys," said Davin
Sweeney, a junior majoring in Spanish and film studies. He said he
decided to attend "mostly just to hear what these guys say."</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 students signed up within a week, but in one of the
few kinks in the venture, eleventh-hour cancellations reduced the
number of undergraduate attendees to 36.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kann and Lamy were pleased that the students who showed up
included business and science or engineering students along with the
expected political science and international relations majors.</TE>
<TE>   At the Saturday afternoon session, Kann quickly traced the
nation's 20th century race riots, touching on outbreaks of such
violence in Chicago in 1919, Detroit in 1943 and Watts in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Then the students were divided into role-playing groups of
"commissioners" responsible for determining the causes and solutions
of campus violence at such places as Kent State and Jackson State
universities in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   A key aim of the teaching strategy, Kann said, was to spur
students to bounce ideas off one another without risking
embarrassment in front of professors.</TE>
<TE>   "What might seem to be a crazy idea could turn out to be a good
one," Kann said.</TE>
<TE>   At the after-dinner session, Lamy pointed out the high toll on
civilians taken by modern political violence internationally.</TE>
<TE>   Then he prodded the students with provocative questions about the
nation's current war on terror: What's the war all about? Why did we
choose the military over a peaceful response?</TE>
<TE>   The students' theories, although mostly unfriendly to the Bush
administration, were diverse.</TE>
<TE>   One offered the idea that President Bush "was trying to finish his
father's war in the Middle East." Some characterized the current
campaign as an effort by the to U.S. to cling to its position as the
world's dominant power.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation continued on Sunday's late-morning bus trip back
to USC, though about half the students nodded off.</TE>
<TE>   "They were exhausted," Kann said with a chuckle. "I hope it was
from intellectual stimulation. They slept the sleep of the virtuous."</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects State Guidelines on Nuclear Waste Disposal</HD>
<DH>Health: Jurist nullifies regulations allowing the dumping
of low-grade radioactive material in landfills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sacramento County Superior Court judge has nullified recently
enacted state regulations that allowed the dumping of low-grade
radioactive waste in ordinary landfills.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruling, handed down last week and announced Tuesday,
rebuffed state health officials who formulated a rule last year to
make it easier and cheaper for companies and institutions to get rid
of some nuclear waste.</LD>
<LD>   In her ruling, Judge Gail D. Ohanesian stated that the regulations
"will have a significant adverse environmental effect."</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the judge found that, contrary to the claims of state
officials, California has authority to pursue more protective
standards for radioactive waste disposal, but failed to consider that
option--a breach of state law.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Committee to
Bridge the Gap, the California Federation of Scientists and
Physicians for Social Responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Those groups argued that landfills are not engineered to safely
accommodate nuclear waste.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, they said that the levels of radioactivity in the
waste, though comparatively low, are still enough to cause serious
health problems, including cancer, in people exposed to it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great victory for protecting the public from
unnecessary radiation exposure," said Daniel Hirsch, president of the
Committee to Bridge the Gap, an anti-nuclear group.</TE>
<TE>   "The Davis administration had deregulated the waste, and the court
has found it illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Businesses and institutions that generate the radioactive waste
now await guidance on what standards state health officials will use
to govern cleanup and disposal.</TE>
<TE>   In California, at least half a dozen power plants and laboratory
sites are poised for decommissioning, which will generate large
volumes of waste that will have to be stored on site or sent
out-of-state to facilities licensed to accept the waste.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of disposal in licensed dumps is much higher than the
cost of putting the waste in local landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Places where nuclear waste cleanups are underway include
Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Simi Valley and one
reactor at Southern California Edison's San Onofre power plant.</TE>
<TE>   Universities, major hospitals and some biotechnology firms also
generate low-level radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne's shipments of nuclear debris to the Bradley Landfill
in Sun Valley prompted a public outcry recently.</TE>
<TE>   Whether such disposal practices pose a public health threat has
been the subject of intense debate.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman Dan Beck said the waste does not put people's
health at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to hear from the regulatory agencies on what it [the
ruling] means. Then we'll comply with whatever guidelines the state
develops," Beck said.</TE>
<TE>   California has been struggling to develop a strategy for
radioactive waste disposal.</TE>
<TE>   One remedy pursued by former Gov. Pete Wilson called for building
a disposal site at Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert 20 miles from the
Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   However, that plan was blocked by opponents concerned that the
waste could make its way into drinking water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations were intended to allow some of the waste to be
diverted to up to 170 landfills statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "[California's Department of Health Services] has been playing
fast and loose with the facts for too long, and the court caught up
with them.</TE>
<TE>   "This regulation created a public health threat and an intolerable
environmental risk," said state Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Yet the legal ruling tosses California's program for low-level
radioactive waste disposal into a quandary.</TE>
<TE>   Romero has introduced a bill that would require low-level
radioactive waste be disposed at approved sites only.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Environmental Quality Committee is scheduled to
consider the bill Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The state regulations that the court rejected allowed waste to
enter a landfill as long as it averaged no more than 25 millirems of
radioactivity per shipment, an exposure equivalent to about 21/2
chest X-rays annually.</TE>
<TE>   But the risk of fatal cancer over the lifetime of a person exposed
every year even to 25 millirems is one in 1,000, Hirsch said.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch maintained that the 25-millirem average could permit
someone to receive far higher doses than the average.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) has introduced a bill that
would require cleanup of contaminated sites to meet the strictest
federal standards imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl said such cleanup standards would make the risk of cancer
hundreds of times lower than was the case under the regulation that
was struck down.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state health department declined to comment on
the court decision until agency officials had more opportunity to
review it.</TE>

<HD>Motive Unknown in Clinic Rampage</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police identify the gunman in Monday's attack that
killed three women in the City of Commerce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS and JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police Tuesday tried to unravel the motive of a gunman, identified as
"mentally unstable," who fatally shot three women at a City of
Commerce clinic, including the doctor who owned it.</LD>
<LD>   The gunman, who killed himself, was Eduardo Cruz, 51, of Pico
Rivera, said Sheriff's Deputy Rick Varela.</LD>
<LD>   A day after the shooting, investigators said they had determined
that Cruz was mentally disturbed--a witness Monday described Cruz as
"acting weird"--but they were still talking to his friends and
relatives to decipher the motive.</LD>
<TE>   Co-workers said he sometimes had conflicts with a doctor at the
clinic, but, "It is unknown at this time what precipitated the
shooting," said Deputy Sonia Parra.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues of Cruz, an X-ray technician at the Superior Medical
Clinic where the shooting occurred, described him both as a quiet
man--small in stature--and as one whose temper could sometimes flare.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie is a mild-mannered person," said Debbie Graves, former
manager of the Commerce clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Medical assistant Jennie Avila said, "People said he was
aggressive at times, but I never saw that side of him."</TE>
<TE>   The victims were identified as Dr. Lucia Caridad Lorenzo, 43, of
Bel-Air; registered nurse Patricia Oglesby, 49, of Pico Rivera; and
Roxanne Ruiz, 25, of East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting happened early Monday afternoon after Cruz arrived at
the clinic on East Olympic Boulevard dressed in street clothes rather
than his usual medical uniform.</TE>
<TE>   When the shooting began, patients fled into the street. Oglesby
and Ruiz were declared dead at the scene; Lorenzo died about two
hours after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to Make Sense of the Three Deaths</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, colleagues struggled to understand the deaths of the
dedicated doctor and the other two women--one of whom had rented a
room to Cruz at her Pico Rivera house.</TE>
<TE>   Oglesby's son, Mario Restrepo, 30, said his mother had needed the
extra income and that Cruz had sold his condominium when she rented
space to him for about six months last year.</TE>
<TE>   "They got along great at work, and my mom needed the help,"
Restrepo said. He didn't know why Cruz moved out some months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "But I know he always carried a gun," Restrepo said.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel DuBria, a physician assistant who worked for Lorenzo, said,
"God, I'm going to miss them. The sad part is that we'll really never
know what happened."</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach relatives of victim Roxanne Ruiz were not
successful.</TE>
<TE>   Graves said Lorenzo, whose family lives in Miami, was originally
from Cuba and met her husband, Reza Ehsan, at medical school in
Illinois. The couple, who had two small daughters, were in the
process of building a house in Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   The wife-and-husband team operated four medical facilities
specializing in pediatrics and prenatal care, in Mar Vista, North
Hills and East Los Angeles in addition to the Commerce medical
center, which served primarily low-income patients.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues described Lorenzo as a caring doctor who at times was
more interested in healing than profits.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very young physicians--really liked to help the poor
people," Graves said. "If you didn't have any money, we would just
see you for free."</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Montgomery, 73, a patient who lived across the street from
Lorenzo's Mar Vista clinic, said the doctor used to visit her at home
because her osteoporosis kept her confined to bed.</TE>
<TE>   "She never said, 'How are you going to pay for this?'" Montgomery
said. "She was just beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   But Graves, the one who described Cruz as mild-mannered, also said
Lorenzo's professional relationship with Cruz was occasionally rocky.</TE>
<TE>   The two would argue periodically and Cruz would tell Graves, "I
can't stand her anymore. I want to get out of here."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz confided in Graves because she now works at the Women's
Corner Medical Center in Montebello, where Cruz would work when he
was fighting with Lorenzo.</TE>
<TE>   "He worked with us with no problem," Graves said. "He did
excellent work."</TE>
<TE>   But he always returned to work at the Commerce facility.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Lorenzo would go and rehire him again," said Graves. "He
would leave me in midair and go back to work with Dr. Lorenzo."</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues and friends of the victims also struggled to understand
why Cruz allegedly shot Oglesby.</TE>
<TE>   A Source of Support for Young Neighbor</TE>
<TE>   Oglesby, who also had another adult child and a teenage son and
daughter, until last week worked the weekend morning shift at a
McDonald's in Pico Rivera to supplement her income from the clinic,
said Terry Castaneda, a next-door neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   She raised her four children on her own after her husband left for
Mexico six years ago, Restrepo said.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Louise Solis, 18, counted on Oglesby for
support. Frequently, Solis would call Oglesby in the morning and talk
about her personal goals for that month.</TE>
<TE>   Oglesby, always willing to take Solis under her arm, once took the
teenager to Magic Mountain along with her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We called each other everyday," said Solis. "She just listened
and supported me."</TE>
<TE>   Restrepo said he will care for his teenage siblings, 18-year-old
Roy and 15-year-old Angelica.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz's friends said they were shocked when they saw reports of the
rampage on the news.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really unexpected," said Maria Banuelos, 17, his
goddaughter. "He was a people person. It wasn't something someone
could have predicted."</TE>
<TE>   Banuelos said that Cruz was married to her aunt, but that they had
divorced about a decade ago. Still, he stayed in touch with her
family, visiting their home in Pasadena often.</TE>
<TE>   His parents live in Colombia, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sad," she said. "With all the family, he was very nice."</TE>

<HD>Chief, Charging Conspiracy, Berates Mayor, Police Union</HD>
<DH>LAPD: In urging council to give him a second term, Parks blames
politics for an increase in crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A determined Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks used his
appeal to the City Council on Tuesday to denounce Mayor James K. Hahn and
the city's police union, whom Parks accused of conspiring to make life
better for police officers at the expense of public safety.</LD>
<LD>   The chief's extraordinary address was covered live by local television
stations and made before a packed council chamber, with hundreds of his
supporters listening quietly as he excoriated the very political
leadership whose support he was courting. At one point, Parks suggested
that political motives had cost lives.</LD>
<LD>   "You as council members and the commission in the future will have to
determine how many lives should be lost to accommodate a police union as
payback for its endorsement of the mayor and to accommodate a small
number of community activists who want the Police Department at their
beck and call," he said. "The true question is how much emphasis is
placed on the value of life over political agendas."</LD>
<TE>   Parks has been a Los Angeles police officer for 37 years, and he
appeared for Tuesday's hearing in the dark blue uniform of the LAPD--his
adorned with the four stars on the collar that only the chief is allowed
to wear.</TE>
<TE>   Somber and deliberate, he read for more than an hour. He addressed the
council members individually by name as they sat a few feet away.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor did not attend the session, and afterward his staff refused
to make him available for comment. Hahn had no public events Tuesday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "Mayor Hahn was disappointed that Chief Parks chose to use his time
before the council to engage in personal attacks instead of laying out a
vision for the next five years at the LAPD," said Julie Wong, a
spokeswoman for the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Others who came in for criticism from Parks were quicker to respond.
Rick Caruso, president of the Police Commission that denied Parks his
reappointment, defended the panel's decision and its process.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, who heads the police union, called the chief's remarks
"absurd" and said the union was not as powerful as Parks suggested.</TE>
<TE>   In the council chambers, the chief suggested sinister motives by his
opponents, principally Hahn and the union. He concluded his statement by
acknowledging that the odds were against his reappointment, but he urged
the council to give him a chance.</TE>
<TE>   The council is expected to vote today on whether to overturn the
commission's 4-1 decision. To date, only three of the council's 15
members--Nate Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Jan Perry--have expressed
strong support for the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Although members of the council said they were impressed by some of
the things Parks said, several questioned whether he would be able to
secure the 10 votes needed to override the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "His speech was really, really impressive," said Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski, who heads the council's Public Safety Committee. "There may
have been some minds changed, but I just don't know. I just don't think
there are enough votes to overturn it."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is still an extraordinarily uphill battle for the chief in
council," he said, adding that he would reserve voicing his opinion until
the council discussed the matter in today's session.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate how negative and personal this debate has become,
for all sides and for the sake of the city," Weiss said. "I think that
it's important to remember that no one in public office--an elected
official or an appointed official--has a right to a public job. . . . We
need to keep this in mind as we evaluate what has occurred here."</TE>
<TE>Hearing Not Fair, Chief Asserts</TE>
<TE>   Parks' address blended his defense of his record with his curt
rejection of the decision to deny him a second term. Throughout, he
alluded to political machinations that he said prevented him from
receiving a fair hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, he argued that it was unfair to judge him on the
city's increase in crime over the last two years. He noted that crime had
declined in his first two years as chief, and he blamed the recent
increases on politics and politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Parks said the drive to alter the Police Department's
work schedule, to adopt a federal consent decree governing LAPD reform
and to take officers out of patrol duties and put them into community
policing assignments caused crime to increase. Mayor Richard Riordan, who
appointed Parks, agreed to the consent decree and pushed Parks to beef up
popular community policing programs. Hahn, who succeeded Riordan, also
supported those moves and pressed for the revised work schedule as well.</TE>
<TE>   All three efforts enjoyed strong council support.</TE>
<TE>   "We were directed to move forward swiftly and implement all three of
these changes," Parks said. "Then, as arrests went down, crime went up
and [those] who were responsible for these decisions refused to take
responsibility. They have disingenuously turned to me, as chief of
police, and asked, 'Why is crime going up?' "</TE>
<TE>   Parks added: "You cannot take police resources off the street in this
volume and expect it will not have a negative impact on crime."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that when the senior lead officer program was reinstated in
2000, 168 officers were removed from patrol duties. Meanwhile, up to 300
officers were removed from patrol to work on reforms outlined in a
federal consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Parks said, officer deployment is down by about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "In each instance, the department voice was ignored," he said. "We
were directed to move forward swiftly and implement all three of these
changes."</TE>
<TE>Mayor Told Him to Retire, Parks Says</TE>
<TE>   Parks was even more pointedly critical of the process by which Hahn
had opposed him. He told council members that he first informed the mayor
in January that he would be seeking a second term. At that time, Parks
says, the mayor urged him to retire and told him that he had already
secured three votes on the five-member commission to oust him.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the mayor, however, denied that allegation Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said he refused to give up his bid for a second term, adding
that he would not be part of "a conspiracy" to remove him from office.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of those themes have long been part of the evaluation of
Parks, the chief introduced a new charge Tuesday. He said he is
suspicious of millions of dollars sent from the city government to the
Police Protective League for the purpose of defending officers in
misconduct hearings. Parks said he doubts whether the money was used for
that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would the city give this money to the league at this time, as
they did?" the chief asked. "Was it to give them a war chest to go after
me?"</TE>
<TE>   He did not substantiate that claim, which union leaders and others
denied.</TE>
<TE>Chief's Critics Have Own View of LAPD</TE>
<TE>   While Parks blamed political decisions for the LAPD's reduced street
presence in recent years, others have suggested that his leadership has
contributed to woeful morale and attrition. Parks disagreed, arguing that
recruitment and retention of officers is a nationwide problem.</TE>
<TE>   In closing, he warned the council to consider the ramifications that
its actions could have on the secession efforts in the San Fernando
Valley and other areas of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another voter revolt that is directed toward the governance
of the city," Parks said. "They are not asking to be separated from this
Police Department. They are asking to be separated from their governance
in this body and in the mayor's office. . . . That should be a real
wake-up call for everyone in this room."</TE>
<TE>   After the chief's presentation, Caruso defended the panel's evaluation
of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he had a very fair process and the commission really did have
as its No. 1 priority to make sure the process was fair and everything
was looked at from both sides," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Parks had every opportunity to answer questions the
commissioners had about his conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a high regard for the chief and would never want to attack his
name, and that is certainly not my intent," he added. "But he's put
himself in a process in which those kinds of questions need to be asked.
I think the commission would be remiss if we didn't. I was very fair to
the chief. Eyeball to eyeball, we talked about things."</TE>
<TE>Union Official Denies Parks' Claim</TE>
<TE>   Grasso, who was in the council chamber for the chief's remarks,
rejected his assertion that the police union has been controlling Parks'
reappointment process.</TE>
<TE>   "Those remarks are absurd," she said. "And while I'm flattered that he
attributes so much power to the Police Protective League, all we ever
really did was embark on a community education campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We made our point and then we stepped back," she said. "We have not
continued in this grand conspiracy that he illustrates."</TE>

<HD>Lessons in How to Chill Out</HD>
<DH>With competition for colleges creating fierce pressure, top
students and their parents are being given a new message--learn to relax.</DH>

<LD>Inside the San Marino Unified School District boardroom, a special
class is in session. Eight students fit neatly into two rows of chairs.
Pauline Chen looks at the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking in her native Mandarin, the 44-year-old housewife shyly
describes how she drove her daughters Julie and Maggie to achieve so they
could earn admission to University of California campuses. For her
14-year-old son Steven, she has set her sights on Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   But the resulting academic pressure has made for a tense home life.
Her son avoids telling her about school. They fight over how much
homework he does--she does not think five hours a day is enough.</LD>
<TE>   Steven recently told her he'd earned an A on a math test, when in fact
he got a B-minus. "My expectations were really high," she says. "When
they brought home a B, I would yell at them."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the fights with Steven, she enrolled in this class. She
wants "to go with the flow," she says, "to have a more accepting heart."</TE>
<TE>   Persuading parents not to push their children too hard is precisely
the point of this six-week course. In fact, the class--attended by six
mothers and two fathers of San Marino students--is part of a wave of such
initiatives that target high-achievers and their parents nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In California, for example, the Arcadia school district sponsors a
course like the one Chen attends. School districts in Ventura and San
Diego counties have passed new guidelines to cut down on homework. Seven
public schools in San Francisco have added yoga to the curriculum, in
part as a stress reliever. The Palos Verdes district has used state
funding to provide counselors who keep a close eye on bright troubled
students. San Gabriel High has launched a "Resiliency Week" during which
students take workshops on physical and emotional health. And the private
school powerhouse Harvard-Westlake has started a committee to examine the
workload (although its first chairman, a teacher, had to beg off--he had
too much work).</TE>
<TE>   "We have meetings with parents all the time to try and notch it down,"
says Jack Rose, the San Marino superintendent. "We talk about . . .
having children succeed at their own particular pace."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the New England Assn. of Schools and Colleges, in
accreditation visits to some top U.S. boarding schools, has begun asking
those campuses to reduce the frenzied pace on campus. As a result,
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., has launched a study with the aim of
simplifying its schedule. In New Jersey, suburban communities have
established "Ready, Set, Relax!" nights, when no homework is assigned and
extracurricular commitments are canceled. In a suburb of Minneapolis, a
new group called Family Life First has taken to bestowing "seals of
approval" on schools and programs that take measures to "balance
priorities" and reduce stresses on young people.</TE>
<TE>   For most high school students, research suggests, pressure is not a
problem. A recent survey by Public Agenda, a New York-based nonprofit
that does public opinion research, found that most students reported they
were not pushed hard enough. But in the narrow realm of bright students
who apply to the nation's most selective colleges, educators, parents and
psychologists perceive an ever-mounting set of stresses.</TE>
<TE>   The most selective universities are becoming even more so. Admission
rates to Ivy League colleges and top University of California campuses
have declined. UC Berkeley, for example, admitted 29% of applicants in
2000, down from 39.9% five years earlier. Hoping to stand out,
high-achieving students have swelled the enrollments of advanced classes,
summer schools, and college programs that are open to high schoolers.</TE>
<TE>   "To go to school and do well enough to get into a top college--it's
become like a job," says Anne Foster-Keddie, the student body president
at El Segundo High. "Except the hours are longer than most jobs."</TE>
<TE>   In California, the state's soaring immigrant population is sometimes
identified as a source of further anxiety, as upwardly mobile parents
push their children to take advantage of the state's educational bounty.
Says Alhambra High Principal Russell Lee-Sung: "There's an incredibly
high expectation with some immigrant families: You are going to the very
best college. End of discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Fears are surfacing of fragile and burned out high achievers. Bright
college freshmen arrive on campus as either "teacups"--sophisticated but
overprotected; or "crispies"--superstars who cannot sustain their high
school pace any longer, says Wendy Mogel, author of "The Blessing of a
Skinned Knee," which is among the best-selling of a wave of new books
about pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "The teacups break because they literally don't know when to eat, and
what to eat and when to sleep," says Mogel, a Los Angeles psychologist.
"The crispies are so burned out that they've lost their intrinsic
pleasure in learning."</TE>
<TE>   At Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Jane Laughlin hands out
business cards and fliers to students every day. "When you aim for
perfection, you discover it's a moving target," reads one missive. "Moral
for today and days to come: I'll ease up on myself!!!!!"</TE>
<TE>   In tiny print, her cards list the names and numbers of 15 South Bay
counseling services.</TE>
<TE>   Laughlin is Peninsula's safe schools coordinator. In the state's
strongest academic districts, these coordinators often are not security
guards but credentialed counselors who devote considerable time to
reducing pressures on gifted students. Peninsula has plenty of those: It
produced 43 National Merit semifinalists this year. Seventy-six percent
of graduates go directly to four-year colleges. On one side of the
Panther statue near the school's entrance are the words: "Academic
Superiority."</TE>
<TE>   Laughlin sees her job as easing such high expectations. She holds
large meetings for parents as often as four times a year, frequently
counseling families on how to spot signs of stress in their children. One
day a week, she is joined on campus by a licensed psychologist. Says
Laughlin's boss, Associate Principal Mitzi Cress: "We're constantly
saying, 'Take a breath--let's step back.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I call this place the 10th Planet," Laughlin says. "The expectations
and pressure are so great. The kids receive so many messages about what
they should be doing."</TE>
<TE>   Here and elsewhere, adult pleas to relax are often lost on students
who are groomed from a young age to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a struggle where the adults are telling the kids, 'Please let
up a little,' and the kids are resisting," says Harvard-Westlake's dean
of the faculty, David Hinden. "These are competitive kids who want to be
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters, youngsters get mixed messages. SAT preparation
courses have begun to claim that they "reduce pressure" in the same
hard-sell ads in which they emphasize how vital the SAT is to getting
into the right college.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvan Learning Systems has even trademarked the term "stress free" to
describe its own 30-hour SAT prep course. "We don't do any magic
stress-reducing things: You're going to get confidence and reduce stress
by being well-prepared for the test," says Sylvan director of research
Rick Bavaria.</TE>
<TE>   Of the "stress-free" tag in advertisements, he says: "I think that's
something our marketing department came up with."</TE>
<TE>   The Alhambra City and High School Districts organize "Resiliency
Weeks" and aggressively refer stressed-out students to counselors.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, they aggressively promote university study with a
new "Kindergarten Through College" program. Elementary age children
attend campus rallies where they wear T-shirts with their college choices
and sing songs. One goes like this:</TE>
<TE>   I can say my ABCs</TE>
<TE>   Now I'm learning how to read</TE>
<TE>   And a college grad I'll be</TE>
<TE>   In 2000 and eighteen.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," says Tim Dong, the top-ranked student at Alhambra High
School, "you hear people talking about how we need to be totally focused
on college. And other times, people say you shouldn't worry too much
about it."</TE>
<TE>   This semester, Katharine W. Clemmer, an Advanced Placement calculus
teacher at El Segundo High, decided to try an experiment in stress
relief: She stopped assigning homework.</TE>
<TE>   "The children have been pushed too hard," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Her decision has been greeted with as much trepidation as joy. Anne
Foster-Keddie, who sits in a fourth-row seat, says that without homework,
tests count more. At the same time, she and her classmates appreciate the
lighter load.</TE>
<TE>   Foster-Keddie, who turned 18 this month, takes two other AP classes,
including a special economics class that requires her to show up at
school by 7 a.m. She is a teacher's aide in a biology class, is student
body president, and plays on a top-club volleyball team that keeps her
out on some school nights until nearly 11. To stay awake, she drinks
heavily caffeinated soda.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to her stress, she is apart from her parents, who moved away
for business reasons three years ago. After going to Connecticut and
Washington state with them, she moved back to El Segundo, where she was
more comfortable with the school and her friends. Now she does the
laundry and grocery shopping at the duplex she shares with her
24-year-old sister, Katharine.</TE>
<TE>   As far as Foster-Keddie is concerned, the hard work has paid off. She
has been accepted by Yale.</TE>
<TE>   "Anne puts a ton of pressure on herself, in part to live up to her
older siblings," says Katharine Foster-Keddie, who attended Yale. 'But
Anne has also taken on more and accomplished more."</TE>
<TE>   "I got the first B of high school last semester, in literature, and I
was really upset about it," says Anne Foster-Keddie. "My mom said, 'Who
cares?' but that's my mom for you. She's very laid-back."</TE>
<TE>   In calculus, Foster-Keddie and her fellow students seem almost
unnerved by the more relaxed atmosphere. Instead of lectures and homework
review, Clemmer's class consists of problem-solving. The teacher hands
out questions to teams of students that take turns posting solutions on
the board.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot more energy, and if students have a problem, they don't
struggle alone," says Clemmer. "But," she says of her noncompetitive
approach, "I could never have tried this without my track record of
students who score well" on the AP test.</TE>
<TE>   Without that, she says, "the parents would never have allowed it."</TE>
<TE>   In San Marino, the class for parents is gathered in the boardroom.
Rosa Zee, a former school board member and teacher, began leading the
course more than two years ago. She teaches in Mandarin on Thursday
nights, in English on Saturdays. She covers a variety of subjects related
to parenting, from cultural differences to showing children physical
affection. But at the heart of the course is this message: Parents need
to ease up.</TE>
<TE>   Chen joined the class, hoping to improve her relationship with her
youngest child, Steven. A freshman at San Marino High, he declared he
would attend Stanford when he was 7. His mother smiles when Stanford
comes up in conversation. Steven gets a Stanford calendar every year from
a family friend.</TE>
<TE>   When he spends too much time playing games on the computer instead of
doing homework or gets a lackluster grade, his mother brings up Stanford.
The school won't accept a student who doesn't study hard, she reminds
him.</TE>
<TE>   She "brags about" his sisters to her friends, Steven says, but she
nags him.</TE>
<TE>   They agree, however, that the fighting is happening less these days.
Steven thinks it's because of the class she's been taking.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go to that class I feel calm," Pauline Chen says. "Now I go
with the flow."</TE>
<TE>   For her son, Stanford is no longer the only option. USC or a
University of California school, she says, would be good enough.</TE>

<HD>A Belief So Deep, Priest Scandals Can't Shake It</HD>
<DH>Religion: Catholics like Maria Lopez don't lose faith. She says God
does too much for her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even after the Roman Catholic Church's clergy sex scandal hit home,
even when her own parish priest was accused of molestation last month,
Maria Lopez never doubted her faith.</LD>
<LD>   How could she? Her entire life, she says, has been one long answered
prayer.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez, a 35-year-old electronics company supervisor in Azusa, says God
has calmed her troubled marriage, miraculously provided every time her
cash ran short, even sent an angel disguised as a woman to talk her out
of suicide.</LD>
<TE>   Her church friends, as dear to her as her own mother, have prayed with
her through her illnesses, fed her family and cared for her children. On
Saturday, she marched with them and 3,000 others through downtown Los
Angeles in support of their faith. After Mass on Sunday, she gathered
with a dozen others, clasping hands and offering fervent prayers for her
church, the priests and all abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   The priests in her life have baptized her four children, blessed her
home and counseled her through depression. Her own pastor, Father David
Granadino of St. Frances of Rome in Azusa, is under investigation on
allegations that he molested boys, but Lopez and her children say they
know only his goodness.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's life offers a glimpse into why the Catholic Church's spiraling
crisis is not likely to drive many devout Catholics away from their
spiritual touchstone. Her faith, she says, is not rooted in a hierarchy
of men, but in the redeeming and nourishing power of Jesus' love. In the
rhythms of weekly Mass, in the deep friendships forged, her faith is her
life and her church is her family.</TE>
<TE>   "Our faith is based on God and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and
not on a priest," Lopez says. "Everybody is human; everybody falls at one
time or another. As Christians, we should forgive. I am not someone to
judge others."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, a Mexico native, shares her testimony with an effervescent
smile and a rapid, passionate stream of words. In hours of conversation
about her faith, she never once mentioned Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, Pope
John Paul II or issues of dogma until asked about them.</TE>
<TE>   Women's ordination? Married priests?</TE>
<TE>   "I never think about those things, to be honest," Lopez says.</TE>
<TE>   What informs her faith is apparent the minute you approach her
four-bedroom, blue stucco home near the end of an Azusa cul-de-sac. Her
front door is flanked by a prominent statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
Inside her immaculately kept home, every room resembles a shrine, with
statues of angels and doves, religious art and prayers mounted over
doorways.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's husband, Jorge, usually attends Mass on Friday mornings
because his job as chef at a Glendale country club keeps him busy the
rest of the week. Two of their children attend St. Frances school. Three
of them won "altar servers of the year" last year and have honorary
plaques and pictures of a church-sponsored Disneyland trip to show for
it.</TE>
<TE>   All of the children have faith testimonies too, though these must be
prodded out of them by their beaming mother.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge, 14, shyly noted that God had helped him boost his grades enough
this year to finally realize his dream of playing on the school and city
baseball teams. Anabely, 12, remembers the time she prayed the rosary and
subsequently aced an exam. Fernando, 11, says God helped heal his
grandfather, mother and cousins during times of illness.</TE>
<TE>   Christian, 8, has no particular testimony, but volunteers that he was
sad because he couldn't make his first confession in March with
Granadino, who has been removed from duty by the Los Angeles archdiocese
pending results of the investigation. Church officials say the priest has
"forcefully" denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best priest, because he has the same [flattop] hair as
mine," Christian says.</TE>
<TE>   The three oldest children, along with their parents, were interviewed
by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy during Holy Week, says Lopez.
They say the deputy asked the children how they liked being altar
servers, whether they had ever heard of any problems involving Granadino
or other priests.</TE>
<TE>   Anabely says she reported two problems--one priest, not Granadino,
once yelled at an altar server for failing to set up the chalice
properly; another church official once kept a server after Mass until she
learned to correct the mistake she had made during service.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lopez family says that Father David, as they call him, had
never hurt them, had always made them happy with jokes, compliments and a
perennial smile. He asked about their classes, brought in pizza for the
altar server meetings and arranged the Disneyland trips. Last June, he
came by to bless the new family pool--another gift from God, Lopez says,
made possible by a home refinance that dropped their monthly mortgage
payments by $400.</TE>
<TE>   Anabely says Father David always gave homilies that even children
could understand. She remembers the time he talked about how his tough
Air Force experiences had taught him not to complain and to be grateful
for what he had.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, I don't believe [the charges] because he's so nice," says
Anabely, an honor roll student with brown hair and braces who, like her
mother, wears a cross around her neck. "But anyway, I'm serving God.
Father David is one priest; there are many others."</TE>
<TE>   For Lopez, the bonds of faith were not always so strong. She says her
mother died when she was 5, and her father immigrated to California ahead
of her and 12 siblings to work. Until she joined him in 1976 at the age
of 9, she was raised by an older sister in Mexico who could not afford to
send her to school and did not always bring her to Mass.</TE>
<TE>   It was after she came to Pasadena and joined St. Andrew's Church that
she began to learn about her faith, she says. A church woman took her
under her wing, taught her to pray and helped prepare her for first Holy
Communion. A St. Andrew's priest protected her from a local bully,
telling her: "No one will ever touch you again. Do not be scared."</TE>
<TE>   After she and her husband married and bought their Azusa home 11 years
ago, she had to take a full-time job. The dual burdens of work and family
brought new strains. Lopez says she started drinking and partying. She
started arguing with her husband, who felt she was neglecting the family.</TE>
<TE>   Then, one day four years ago, things began to change. She says she
decided to drive to the mountains and kill herself, but needed gas. While
she was refueling, she says, an elderly woman came up to her, a total
stranger. Lopez says the woman told her: Peace be with you. You have
children who love you. Why are you thinking of killing yourself?</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was shocked. "I believe she was an angel," she says. "No one
ever touched my heart like that."</TE>
<TE>   She says the brief encounter opened her for the first time to
confronting the mistakes she had made in her life. Then she fell into
clinical depression, began popping more than a dozen prescribed pills a
day and finally went on disability leave. That's when her church
community rallied around her, sending groups to her home to pray and
others to feed and watch her children.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Lupita Diaz, a woman who Lopez says has become the
mother she barely had. Diaz marched with Lopez and her children in the
rally Saturday, carrying signs--"Sigue a Cristo," or Follow Christ--and
singing exuberant hymns.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz also threw a surprise birthday brunch for her in February,
complete with her three favorite cakes (coconut, chocolate mousse and
chocolate pineapple), and leaves messages on her voicemail: "Are you OK?
I just want you to know I love you and Jesus loves you."</TE>
<TE>   Such friendships led Lopez to</TE>
<TE>   join the church prayer group; her aith has become a central part of
her life ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Every time she climbs into her Dodge van, she makes the sign of the
cross for safety. Every Friday, she prays the rosary and fasts for half
the day. She attends "healing Masses" for others, and carries religious
books with her constantly--titles like "Persevere Through God's Love."
She reads them during her children's baseball practice and other moments
of down time.</TE>
<TE>   And Lopez returns the charity she has received. She doesn't always
have much to spare; her own family has no savings and struggles to make
ends meet each week on a $4,000 monthly income.</TE>
<TE>   But what she has, she shares: sandwiches for the two hungry men who
knocked on her door one day asking for help; a bag of food for the
15-year-old who just lost his father; a dollar last Sunday to the new
family from Mexico who came to church hungry and homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest personal project each year is a food and toy drive for an
orphanage in Tijuana. Throughout the year, she buys toiletries and small
gifts, asks family and friends to donate what they can. Last year, she
was running short when her husband volunteered $200 of his year-end bonus
to help out. The family travels to the orphanage every Christmas season
to cook for the children, play with them and bring them presents.</TE>
<TE>   Such acts embody the Lopez family's life of faith: "to love God and
love others," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens, I am proud of my religion," Lopez says. "I follow
my God and I follow Jesus. This will not change just because of what's
going on."</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Is Backed by Vatican</HD>
<DH>Church: Boston prelate Law says he went to Rome and talked to the
pope. He vows not to resign over sex scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law, in the midst of a massive clerical sexual
abuse scandal, disclosed late Tuesday that he made an unannounced trip to
Rome over the weekend and discussed resigning with Pope John Paul II but
had decided to remain in his job.</LD>
<LD>   Law vowed that "as a result of my stay in Rome, I return home
encouraged in my efforts to provide the strongest possible leadership."
He apparently discussed quitting with Vatican leaders after he sent a
letter Friday to more than 600 Boston-area priests stating that he would
remain in his post.</LD>
<LD>   The 70-year-old Law, America's highest-ranking Catholic prelate, has
been under fire to resign in the face of charges that for many years he
and other church officials allowed pedophiles to work as priests.</LD>
<TE>   Law's secret visit to Rome underscores the Vatican's rapidly growing
concern about the sexual abuse problem. Until recently, church officials
had directed individual dioceses to deal with it on their own. But over
the weekend, in an extraordinary move, the pope summoned America's
cardinals to an emergency meeting next week devoted to the topic.</TE>
<TE>   "The pope and those others with whom I met are very conscious of the
gravity of the situation," Law said in a statement faxed to members of
the media. "It is clear to me that the primary emphasis of the Holy See,
like that of the church in the archdiocese, is upon the protection of
children."</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Archdiocese did not returns calls for comment Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College church historian Thomas O'Connor said Law's statement
seemed to indicate Law wanted to clarify the Boston situation for the
pope. O'Connor said the cardinal's statement suggested the Vatican had no
intention of allowing Law to resign.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is he was told, 'Of course not, please go back and work
harder,' " O'Connor said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, church officials here have given prosecutors the names
of more than 80 priests suspected of molesting children for more than 40
years. The controversy burst forward after the child molestation
conviction in January of former priest John J. Geoghan, who is now in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal escalated with the release last week of documents showing
that Law authorized the transfer from Boston to Southern California of
another known pedophile, Father Paul Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley received sick pay from the Boston archdiocese while he worked
at St. Ann's parish in San Bernardino, occasionally supervising youth
retreats. Until two weeks ago, Shanley lived in the Hillcrest section of
San Diego with a companion. He has not been charged with a crime. His
whereabouts are unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Law recommended Shanley to California church officials as a priest "in
good standing" from the Boston archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement, Law said that "for the past few days I have been in
Rome to seek counsel and advice."</TE>
<TE>   He continued: "The focus of my meetings was the impact of the Shanley
and other sexual abuse cases upon public opinion in general and
specifically upon the members of the archdiocese."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing growing demands that he step down, Law declared that "the
fact that my resignation has been proposed as necessary was part of my
presentation" to the pope.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the opportunity to meet with several officials of the Holy
See," Law said. "The Holy Father graciously received me."</TE>
<TE>   Law's disclosure was "very strange," according to Boston University
theologian Thomas Groome, author of "What Makes Us Catholic." Groome,
like many others in Boston, assumed the cardinal was in his chancery all
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   At least two top-ranking U.S. bishops met with the pope last week and
returned home with their work apparently complete, Groome noted.</TE>
<TE>   "These fellows were sent home," Groome said Tuesday night. "But maybe
[Vatican officials] realized from talking to Law that there really is a
crisis and it is more dour and dire than they were willing to realize."</TE>
<TE>   Law canceled a meeting of vicars on Thursday, broke a long-standing
custom by not saying Mass at Holy Cross Cathedral on Sunday and had not,
until Tuesday, publicly commented on the Vatican's unusual call for a
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Shaw, a former spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops and the Knights of Columbus, saw Law's summons to the Vatican,
with the other seven U.S. cardinals, as a show of support.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the pope wants it to be known that he backs Cardinal Law and
he wants it also to be known that the cardinal's colleagues in the
American hierarchy do as well," Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement, Law said he would study the archdiocese's handling
of sexual abuse by "reviewing the past in as systematic and comprehensive
way as possible, so that legitimate questions which have been raised
might be answered."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the diocesean television station and its newspaper would
assist in making that record available.</TE>
<TE>   But Roderick MacLeish Jr., the attorney for Gregory Ford, an alleged
victim of Shanley who came forward two weeks ago as the documents were
made public, decried that line of reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not for me to decide whether Cardinal Law should return from
Rome to face the anger in this community," MacLeish said. "But I do say
this: The idea that the story of Paul Shanley will be told through media
controlled by the Archdiocese of Boston is quite frankly incomprehensible
and pathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is going to be culled through the criminal and civil
justice system," MacLeish said.</TE>
<TE>   Concluding his statement, Law quoted from his own letter on Friday to
"brother priests" in the Boston archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "My desire," he reiterated, "is to serve this archdiocese and the
whole church with every fiber of my being. This I will continue to do as
long as God gives me the opportunity."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Tuesday that he will wrap
up his Mideast peace mission today after making some "progress" toward a
peace plan that would have components addressing the key security,
political and humanitarian problems in the region.</LD>
<LD>   Powell's proposal will include holding an international peace
conference to spur momentum toward resolving the broader
Palestinian-Israeli disputes, according to Israeli, Arab and U.S.
officials.</LD>
<LD>   But with many details still to be worked out, the initiatives are
expected to be modest, leaving the U.S.-orchestrated process susceptible
to setbacks or reversals, the officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "We are making progress, and I look forward to furthering that
progress over the next 24 hours," Powell told reporters Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial issue is security, including bringing an end to
the nearly 3-week-old Israeli incursion in the West Bank and the nearly
19-month-long Palestinian uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Powell conceded Tuesday that he probably will not be able to negotiate
an immediate cease-fire, the goal when he began his diplomatic rescue
mission more than a week ago. He also probably will leave the region
without getting the situation back to where it was when Israel invaded
Palestinian territory March 29.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. goal is instead to orchestrate a sequence of steps whereby
the Palestinians would pledge to take measures to end suicide bombings
and other attacks while the Israelis would withdraw from recently
occupied areas.</TE>
<TE>   But this plan already faces major hurdles. While Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon has pledged to pull out of most Palestinian cities
and towns within a week, he is balking at withdrawing from Bethlehem and
Ramallah. Israeli troops are engaged in a standoff with Palestinian
gunmen in the former and have besieged the headquarters of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat in the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said Israel will remain in both cities until Palestinian
militiamen suspected of killing an Israeli Cabinet minister last fall, of
organizing arms shipments from Iran and of other acts are handed over to
Israel or, in some cases, go into exile.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian Authority is hoping that in this case, Israel will
bend in light of the pressure and give up," the prime minister said.
"This will not happen."</TE>
<TE>Powell to Meet Arafat and Hold Talks in Egypt</TE>
<TE>   Israel also has informed Powell that it will reserve the right to
conduct raids into West Bank areas if it has information about security
threats. And it intends to carry out a previously announced plan to
create three buffer zones between Palestinian areas and Israel. Both
measures are unacceptable to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was scheduled to hold final talks with Arafat at the
Palestinian leader's compound in Ramallah today, fly to Cairo for a
meeting with Egyptian and Jordanian officials and then return home.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops Tuesday briefly reentered the northern town of Tulkarm
and villages around the cities of Nablus and Ramallah in what were
described as search-and-arrest missions. Palestinians said five people
were shot by Israeli troops in Tulkarm and five militants were arrested.
Israel also moved into another West Bank town and three villages around
Jerusalem, partly due to fears of new violence timed for today's
celebration of Israel's independence day.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also reopened Ketziot, a notorious detention center in the
southern Negev desert, to hold thousands of Palestinians arrested during
the current military campaign. More than 4,000 prisoners were being held
at a center near Ramallah in severely overcrowded conditions, an Israeli
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Ketziot was built during the first Palestinian uprising against
Israeli military rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, carried out from
1987 to 1993. The army could not say how many prisoners would be held in
Ketziot this time around. Human rights organizations in the 1980s said
prisoners lived in harsh conditions in tents where they were exposed to
searing heat by day and freezing cold at night.</TE>
<TE>   On the political front, the Bush administration hopes to organize an
international conference that would make progress on the broader
political issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Holding such a
gathering would address a key Palestinian and Arab condition for any
commitment to ending hostilities with Israel, according to Israeli and
U.S. sources.</TE>
<TE>   The agenda is the first major source of potential dispute. Powell
hopes to make the recent Arab League initiative--offering Israel full
recognition by the Arab world in exchange for withdrawal from areas
occupied in the 1967 Middle East War--a key topic of discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, who met with Powell for an hour Tuesday, said he believes a
regional conference probably would be convened in June, possibly in the
United States. But in an interview with Channel 10, he declared that
"Israel cannot withdraw to the '67 borders. Do you imagine Israel doing
this?"</TE>
<TE>   He said that if the question of resettling Palestinian refugees who
live outside Israel and the Palestinian territories came up at a
conference, he would present "a detailed plan suggesting how they can be
settled in the same countries they live in today." And he said Jerusalem
would not be on the agenda, adding that the city "is not open for
negotiation or bargaining." Palestinians hope to make East Jerusalem the
capital of a future Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   He also rejected Arafat's participation in the gathering.</TE>
<TE>Norway Offers to Help Palestinians Rebuild</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's proposals have been largely dismissed as unworkable even by
Israeli commentators. Dovish Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, both members of the Labor Party, have
pushed Sharon to offer the Palestinians a "diplomatic horizon" to
encourage them to return to negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every Arab state would probably refuse to participate in an
international peace conference if Sharon came and Arafat didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Powell this week suggested that the gathering might be held at a
lower, ministerial level to get around Sharon's refusal to meet with
Arafat. But if Sharon turned up--as former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir did unexpectedly during the 1991 Madrid conference--many Arabs
could refuse to participate, a key foreign minister in the region told
The Times on Tuesday. The minister requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The only issue that is not controversial is the effort to deal with
the massive humanitarian crisis in the West Bank. Norway is already
offering to provide the first financial aid to rebuild the vast areas of
destruction created since Israeli troops and tanks rumbled into
Palestinian towns and villages.</TE>

<HD>Ban on 'Virtual' Child Porn Is Upset by Court</HD>
<DH>Law: U.S. justices, in defending free speech, rule the government
can't make it a crime to show sexual images that 'appear to be' children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a surprisingly strong defense of the right to free speech, the
Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down part of the federal child
pornography law that makes it a crime to sell or own images of
computer-created children engaged in sex.</LD>
<LD>   The justices also said the 1st Amendment shields films and photographs
that show adult actors who "appear to be minors" involved in sex.</LD>
<LD>   In both instances, the court said, in a 6-3 vote, that Congress had
gone too far in a laudable effort to stamp out child pornography.</LD>
<TE>   "The sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime, and an act
repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people," said Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   But no real children were portrayed in the photographs and films at
issue in Tuesday's decision, he said. The government cannot make it a
crime to show sexual images that only "appear to be" children without
threatening legitimate filmmakers, photographers and advertisers, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Award-winning Hollywood films such as "Traffic" and "American Beauty"
could be subject to prosecution, Kennedy said, if the law were applied
literally. Those films contain scenes of sexuality featuring adult actors
portraying underage characters.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling creates an immunity for a new generation of "virtual"
pornographers who rely entirely on computer images. So long as no real
children are portrayed--or "morphed" into a sex scene--the image, film or
photograph cannot be prosecuted as child pornography, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   There is one exception. A truly obscene work can be prosecuted as a
crime, the court noted, since obscenity is outside the protections of the
1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   But it is hard to win an obscenity case, and prosecutions are rare. To
win such a case, the government must convince a jury that a film is
sexually graphic, "patently offensive" and lacks any other redeeming
value.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft condemned the court's ruling, saying it would
make the prosecution of child pornography "immeasurably more difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Where possible, the attorney general said prosecutors will "pursue
general obscenity charges" against virtual child pornographers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am committed to working with the Congress to develop strong
measures to fight child pornography that will survive judicial scrutiny,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>Lott Sees Attempt to Change the Law</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said an effort will be
made to revise the law so that it passes constitutional muster. "Clearly
there is a desire and a need to have laws on the books in that area," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, then a senator from Missouri, was among the lawmakers who
pressed for the passage of the Child Pornography Prevention Act in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   That measure broadened the definition of child pornography to include
any "visual depiction that is, or appears to be, a minor engaging in
sexually explicit conduct." Moreover, visual depiction was redefined to
include a "computer-generated image or picture."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers were determined to bring the full weight of federal criminal
law against those who used new computer technology to create realistic
images of children and teenagers engaged in sex acts.</TE>
<TE>   These images were offensive in themselves, they said, and could be
used to "whet the appetites of pedophiles and child sexual abusers." A
first-time offender could receive up to 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   But the new law pushed the boundaries of the free-speech protections
set by the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, in opinions written by the late Justice Byron R. White,
the court said that all child pornography could be made illegal because
it exploited children.</TE>
<TE>   The Free Speech Coalition, a California trade association for the
adult entertainment industry, went to federal court in San Francisco to
challenge the new law on the grounds that real children were not being
exploited.</TE>
<TE>   Photographers, filmmakers and bookstore owners joined the challenge
and claimed they feared possible prosecution over depictions that might
be seen as involving minors.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge rejected their claim as farfetched, but the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with it on a 2-1 vote. The law cannot
make it a crime to show "images of fictitious children engaged in
imaginary" sex acts, the panel said.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court took up the government's appeal in the case of
Ashcroft vs. Free Speech Coalition, 00-795, and in an unexpected move,
affirmed the ruling of the 9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said that at least since the days of William Shakespeare and
his "Romeo and Juliet," the romances of the young have been a recurring
theme in literature, drama and movies.</TE>
<TE>   "The visual depiction of an idea--that of teenagers engaging in sexual
activity--is a fact of modern society," he wrote. If prosecutors were
free to bring criminal charges in all such cases, it would certainly
chill filmmakers and photographers, he said.</TE>
<TE>Pedophile Argument Is Dismissed</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the Justice Department was not likely to bring charges
against a Hollywood film studio. But the Supreme Court regularly strikes
down laws that infringe on freedom of speech, even if no prosecutions
were brought.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy also rejected the government's argument that virtual child
pornography can be banned because it is used by pedophiles to lure
children into sexual activity. "There are many things innocent in
themselves, such as cartoons, video games and candy, that might be used
for immoral purposes, yet we would not expect those to be prohibited
because they can be misused," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed, however, that the government remains free to prosecute
those who make, sell or own sexually explicit images of real children
that are "morphed" into sex scenes. The 1996 law also prohibits images
that are "adapted or modified" so that it appears a minor is engaged in
sex, and that portion of the law went unchallenged.</TE>
<TE>   But federal prosecutors feared that they will have a hard time proving
that children portrayed on an Internet sex site, for example, are real
children and not computer-created images. In the end, the Supreme Court's
opinion does not answer that concern.</TE>
<TE>   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer joined Kennedy's opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the result and said the
government can still bring successful prosecutions by showing real
children were involved.</TE>
<TE>Rehnquist, Scalia Back Narrow Reading</TE>
<TE>   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor agreed the law went too far by covering
young-looking actors in films. But she said she would have upheld the ban
on computer-generated child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia
dissented, saying the law should have been read narrowly and upheld.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the chief justice said that even after the law took
effect filmmakers produced movies such as "Traffic" without apparent fear
of criminal prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "The chill felt by the court has apparently never been felt by those
who actually make movies," Rehnquist said.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, the Directors Guild of America praised the decision.
"From 'Romeo and Juliet' to 'American Beauty' and 'Traffic,' artists have
told stories that included allusions of adolescent sexuality, stories
which have enriched our lives," said DGA President Martha Coolidge.</TE>
<TE>   Coolidge, whose films include the teen comedies "Valley Girl" and
"Real Genius," said, "Every American would suffer the loss of freedom if
this overzealous governmental intrusion into our rights of expression had
been allowed to stand."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Supervisors Vote to Give Closed El Toro Base to Irvine</HD>
<DH>Government: Spitzer calls the airport 'dead.' The city will meet
Thursday with the Navy, which could still sell all or part of the land.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walking away from eight years and $54 million worth of planning,
Orange County supervisors voted Tuesday to hand the closed El Toro Marine
base to the city of Irvine, which wants to turn much of it into parkland.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a significant decision," said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who
pushed for county approval of Irvine's plan. "It was a slim vote, but we
said unequivocally that not only is El Toro dead [as an airport] but the
Board of Supervisors believes that too."</LD>
<LD>   Armed with the county's support, Irvine officials said they will meet
Thursday in Washington to discuss the base's future with the U.S. Navy,
which still owns it.</LD>
<TE>   "This puts wind in our sails for the trip back to D.C.," Irvine
Councilman Chris Mears said.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials announced last month their intent to decide by April 23
whether to sell El Toro and use the proceeds to bolster the military
budget. They could sell all or part of the 4,700-acre base--regardless of
Irvine's plan to annex the property.</TE>
<TE>   Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, long a supporter of building an airport at
El Toro, cast the deciding votes for Irvine to take control of the base
land. She did so after pressing for--and being promised--about $2 million
from state park bond funds to develop parks in north Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my emotional issue," Coad said of the park money. "The
citizens in North County will say, 'This is great, we're going to work
together [on the need for more northern parks]. We're going to be hoping
Irvine is successful.' "</TE>
<TE>   Coad also was promised as much as $800,000 in property tax money from
base development to be used for a park trust fund for north Orange
County, where parks are scarce. Irvine officials said they intend to
divert new property taxes into a redevelopment fund but promised to
fulfill Coad's demand for tax money for parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent is to honor this," Mears said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a delegation of elected officials from Los Angeles and
Orange counties arrived Tuesday in Washington to urge federal officials
to postpone the Navy's sale decision.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of local leaders met with Federal Aviation Administration
officials to lobby for the development of an airport at El Toro to handle
Southern California's future air travel needs, said El Segundo Mayor Mike
Gordon, who advocates El Toro to relieve pressure to expand Los Angeles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said late Tuesday that he was "very encouraged" by a meeting
with FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, who promised to try to push the Navy
to postpone its April 23 decision. Several north Orange County cities are
backing an alternative airport plan for El Toro and hope to place it
before voters in November.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very encouraged and thought the meeting was very
constructive," Gordon said from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine wants to take over the base from the Navy, with about 3,200
acres going to the city. The Navy would keep 440 acres to sell along the
base's southern edge--an area the city said it would rezone for 1,500
homes. Under Irvine's plan, money from the sale of the homes would be
sent to the Navy as payment for giving Irvine the bulk of the base.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the base, which closed in 1999, already has been set
aside by the federal government for a wildlife sanctuary. About 100 acres
would stay in county control for various programs and to provide housing
for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine wants to develop most of the base as parkland and other public
uses consistent with last month's countywide vote to replace airport
zoning with zoning for a large urban park, nature preserve and limited
development.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine contingent, including representatives from other supportive
south Orange County cities, hoped to bring to Washington the unanimous
support of county supervisors. But two supervisors, Jim Silva and Chuck
Smith, voted against Irvine's plan, saying it was short on details,
including financing.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Eckles, executive director of a nine-city coalition that backs
Irvine's plan, said the group will argue that the sale would be
quicker--and would produce higher value--under the Irvine plan because of
the new housing that would be built. Irvine would not allow the new
housing if the base is sold piecemeal by the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Navy doesn't bite, they'll sell the base," Eckles said.
"That's their Plan B."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine City Manager Allison Hart said the city would ask developers
who would build on the base to pay for improvements on their portions as
well as shoulder some of the overall costs of developing the park. The
development plan includes 370 acres for a new campus of Cal State
Fullerton, 126 acres for an adjacent campus research park and 228 acres
for university-controlled housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Fair would take another 300 acres for an expansion.
The city also would develop two golf courses, sports fields and 463 acres
for wholesale nurseries. A series of streams and wild lands would run
through the property and act as wildlife corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who brokered the agreement with Coad, said he assured her
that park development would occur throughout Orange County, not just at
El Toro. "There needs to be access for recreational opportunities
countywide," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating El Toro's fate was a separate supervisors' vote, hours
earlier Tuesday, to encourage the possible relocation of the Marine
Corps' West Coast boot camp to El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Jones has suggested taking 1,300
acres at El Toro to move recruits from San Diego, where they train on 388
acres next to San Diego's overcrowded international airport. Doing so
would require federal legislation, because the base already has been
closed.</TE>
<TE>   Coad, Smith and Silva said the Marines would be welcome to stay in
Orange County. Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson said moving the
Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego could upset Irvine's
redevelopment plans but voted for the resolution anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I think national security has a higher priority than the city of
Irvine," Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   In other El Toro business, the board voted to have no role with
environmental cleanup of the former base, including conducting
independent soil tests. The board's action was motivated solely by
economics and the supervisors' attempts to protect the county's general
fund.</TE>
<TE>   But the board's cutting of base expenses stopped with some of the
lucrative contracts for Washington lobbyists and public affairs firms
that just a month and half ago were lobbying for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Since voters pulled the plug on the airport in the March 5 election,
the county's pro-airport lobbying team in Washington has been accruing
bills at an estimated cost of $62,000 a month, Spitzer argued.</TE>
<TE>   But supervisors said they wanted a clearer understanding of which
contracts would be terminated before voting and decided instead to
postpone a decision until next week's meeting.</TE>

<HD>Furor Over French TV Exec's Firing</HD>
<DH>Media: Ouster of the popular chief of Canal Plus sets off a public
outcry against the head of Vivendi Universal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Marie Messier, chairman of Vivendi Universal, fired one of his
key executives Tuesday, touching off a nationally televised war of words
in France and intensifying speculation that the man who built the world's
second-largest media conglomerate is at risk of losing control of his
empire.</LD>
<LD>   The move triggered such controversy that France's Socialist prime
minister went on TV in support of the ousted executive. Lionel Jospin
called into question Vivendi's commitment to French cinema, alluding to
growing criticism of Messier for betraying the nation's culture by buying
Los Angeles-based Universal Studios and moving his family to New York.
Messier's ouster of Pierre Lescure, the beloved chief executive of Canal
Plus, Europe's largest pay TV provider, angered the legions of followers
he has amassed during a long career in television, including as a popular
anchorman. Some unions and Canal Plus employees, in fact, temporarily
took control of Vivendi's own TV channel in France to protest the firing
of Lescure.</LD>
<LD>   The turmoil Tuesday is another setback to Vivendi's grand ambitions to
build a globalentertainment juggernaut from the merger with Universal and
Canal Plus 18 months ago. In the last year, the company has lost nearly
half its stock value, and some shareholders are questioning Messier's
vision to use Universal's films and music and Canal Plus's reach into
European homes to build new wireless services worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   His ability to manage the company and his staying power as head of the
Paris-based conglomerate are expected to be on shareholder's minds next
week at Vivendi's annual meeting in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Messier has been battered by the press, the financial community here
and abroad and even his own board members recently for the company's poor
financial performance.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, Messier said he had no choice but to
oust Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a management crisis," he said, calling Lesure
unprofessional and unethical. "He needed to be loyal. He has not been.
And his performance was not great. When you have neither the loyalty or
the performance, where is your place in the organization?"</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Lescure took up the gauntlet.</TE>
<TE>   He and some of his employees interrupted Canal's regularly scheduled
program Tuesday evening to berate Messier. Lescure made a tearful appeal
for support from Canal Plus staff, saying that Messier negotiated in bad
faith, without following codes of governance set up by the company.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Lescure said he was "pushed overboard." He also said
Canal Plus' 17 years of "editorial independence and liberty are now
threatened."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions with Lescure surfaced even before the complicated merger of
Vivendi, Universal parent Seagram and Canal Plus. Lescure, who is
considered the godfather of pay TV in France and the spiritual leader of
Canal Plus, was reluctant to give up the authority he has held as CEO
since 1984. He inflamed the tensions by using Canal Plus' politically
satirical puppet show, a popular French cultural fixture, to poke fun at
his boss.</TE>
<TE>   Messier's habit of calling himself J2M, short for "Jean-Marie Messier,
master of the world," gave the show's writers plenty of material.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the puppets mocked Messier again, before station managers
pulled the plug and switched to weather.</TE>
<TE>   Messier, meanwhile, was across town on Canal's broadcast rival station
touting his new management plan.</TE>
<TE>   Although Messier and Lescure tried to bury the hatchet, the truce
failed to stick. With Canal Plus faltering, Messier tapped Barry Diller
late last year to head up the Hollywood studio, nudging out Lescure, who
had previously overseen both Canal and Universal.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, Messier gave Lescure and his second-in-command, Denis
Olivennes, an ultimatum, demanding that they deliver a profit within 24
months or be fired.</TE>
<TE>   In protest, Lescure sent an e-mail to Canal Plus employees saying that
Messier shared responsibility for the losses because he continued to
approve the company's costly expansion outside of France. Olivennes, who
had attempted to cut staff and streamline Canal Plus in his two years at
the top, resigned Friday in protest.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus is the largest pay TV operator in Europe, with more than 15
million subscribers, and is a major financial backer of the French film
industry's productions.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike other Vivendi movie and music divisions, Canal Plus has
been a consistent money loser, posting a loss of $439 million in 2001.
The biggest drain has come from its Italian affiliate Telepiu, which has
suffered from piracy, high programming costs and competition from News
Corp.'s pay TV company.</TE>
<TE>   Investors said the bedlam at Canal Plus on Tuesday wounds Messier.
Even before Tuesday's events, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais last week
released a report saying there was a 20% chance Messier would be forced
to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts say it's unlikely Messier will be ousted because
he enjoys overall support of the board. More likely, they say, is that
Messier, now chairman and CEO, may be forced to give up one of his roles.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, reports in France this week say that the influential president
of insurance giant Axa is worried that Vivendi's problems could hurt the
entire French stock market and is urging Vivendi board members to rein in
Messier.</TE>
<TE>   Some board members also have grown impatient with Messier. Marc
Vienot, a former chief executive of Societe General, recently chastised
Messier for being "almost childish" in his craving for publicity.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old executive was toasted in Hollywood this year when he
was the guest of honor at a Town Hall Los Angeles forum. Before his
speech he worked the audience, walking from table to table to introduce
himself to journalists and entertainment executives. He gave his stump
speech about being proud to be a New Yorker and how much he loves
American movies, culture and even California wine.</TE>
<TE>   To seek a higher profile in the U.S., the Messier family moved into a
$17-million Park Avenue apartment in New York.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest worries, however, are still in France at Canal Plus. On
Tuesday, Messier offered Lescure a position as chairman of the Canal Plus
board in exchange for stepping down from management. Lescure refused, and
within minutes, Messier called a press conference to announce Lescure's
successor, Xavier Couture, a TV veteran who runs France's leading
broadcast channel. Lescure's ouster should have little impact on
Universal since he lost control of the studio to Diller.</TE>
<TE>   Lescure's firing and the outcry that followed underscore the mounting
pressure Messier is under to improve the company's languishing stock
price. "The biggest problem with Vivendi right now is that investors
don't know what they're buying into," said Mark Harrington, an analyst at
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many investors failed to embrace Messier's enthusiasm during
the last four years for turning the country's water and waste utility
into a world-class entertainment company. In addition to spending more
than $34 billion to buy Seagram and control of Canal Plus in December
2000, Messier has bought the MP3 music service, has placed a $1.5-billion
bet on U.S. satellite provider EchoStar Communications Corp. and is close
to completing an $11-billion acquisition of the film and television
businesses of USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have been unhappy with the huge debt burden of $16.8 billion
that the acquisitions placed on Vivendi, as well as the loss posted last
year by the company that was the largest in French history.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi lost $11.8 billion after write-downs on a string of the media
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>    People close to the company were surprised that Couture was selected
as Lescure's successor. He is not a high-profile media executive in
France and lacks experience in the complicated pay television business.</TE>
<TE>   Gerard Chollet, leader of Canal Plus' labor union, said employees
would make life difficult for Couture, who is scheduled to start his new
job next week, after Vivendi's board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with board members Tuesday, Messier said he was
confident they supported his management and was not in fear of losing his
job.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm relaxed," he said.</TE>

<HD>British Marines Search for Enemy in Afghan Heights</HD>
<DH>Asia: Mission is the force's first major combat operation in the
war.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Royal Marines have begun a search-and-destroy mission to clear
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters from mountainous terrain in eastern
Afghanistan, the first major combat operation of the conflict by British
land forces.</LD>
<LD>   Details on the operation, which began several days ago, were sketchy
Tuesday. No information was released on the exact location, how many
soldiers were participating or whether there was any fighting.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. and Afghan soldiers have already been searching for Taliban and
Al Qaeda forces in the area.</LD>
<TE>   Eastern Afghanistan is one of the least stable regions of the country.
The Taliban still has significant support in the area, and the porous
border enables terrorists to seek refuge in neighboring Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to clear the remaining Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters from
the east comes as Afghanistan prepares for the return of the nation's
deposed king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, possibly as early as Thursday. The
former monarch had been expected to come home from exile in Italy last
month, but the trip was delayed because of security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai flew to Rome on Monday to
escort the 87-year-old former king home.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah is returning not as ruler but as a private citizen. Aside
from standing as a symbol of national unity, he is to convene a loya
jirga, or grand council, in June to select Afghanistan's next leader and
government.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul, the Afghan capital, remains relatively stable. However, there
has been a string of security threats in recent days, including several
attacks on international security forces and an assassination attempt on
Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim last week in the city of
Jalalabad.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Pentagon on Tuesday identified four U.S. soldiers
killed Monday in an explosion near the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.
The soldiers, who died when a rocket they were trying to disarm exploded,
were identified as Staff Sgt. Brian Craig, 27, of Houston; Staff Sgt.
Justin Galewski, 28, of Olathe, Kan.; Sgt. Jamie Maugans, 27, of Derby,
Kan.; and Sgt. 1st Class Daniel Romero, 30, of Longmont, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Craig, Galewski and Maugans were members of the 710th Explosive
Ordnance Detachment, a 20-member company assigned to an Army facility at
the Navy's submarine base in San Diego. The detachment is part of a
battalion headquartered at Ft. Lewis, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very fortunate to have been with him, because he has made me
such a stronger person," Galewski's wife, Christine, told reporters
Tuesday outside her home in San Diego, standing beside their children,
Chase, 3, and Paige, 2. "And I know I'm going to be able to take care of
my kids, because I'm going to look at him and think about all the things
he would have wanted for them."</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the accident is under investigation, the Pentagon said.
The 107-millimeter rocket was part of a cache of weapons seized in recent
days by U.S. forces near Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   As for the British troops, it was unclear whether the members of the
45 Commando Royal Marines were engaging Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts in
combat in eastern Afghanistan or whether they were mainly sweeping the
area to eliminate possible hide-outs.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Paul Harradine, a British military spokesman at a base near
the town of Bagram, said the troops were deployed several days ago in an
area known to have been a Taliban and Al Qaeda base.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to sweep through, destroy any Al Qaeda and Taliban that
are there, and then deny the group control of that area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the troops were operating in mountainous terrain more than
10,000 feet above sea level, he said. "They are above the snow line, some
of them," Harradine said. "It is very rugged, very windy, snowing at
night."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the forces have suffered no casualties, he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Venezuelans Discussed a Coup</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Bush officials say the topic came up in talks with
military and civilian leaders but that the move was discouraged.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Bush administration officials acknowledged Tuesday that they had
discussed the removal of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for months with
military and civilian leaders from Venezuela, but they insisted that they
had always discouraged unconstitutional action to oust him.</LD>
<LD>   Amid rising congressional criticism, officials said the subject of
removing Chavez had come up intermittently with various Venezuelan groups
while rumors swirled that opponents might oust the increasingly unpopular
leftist leader. Chavez was briefly stripped of power last week but was
restored to office Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   One discussion took place in December, when Gen. Lucas Romero Rincon,
chief of the Venezuelan high command, met with Roger Pardo-Maurer IV, a
policy official in the Pentagon's Western Hemisphere branch, Pentagon
spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said at a briefing. Pardo-Maurer "made it
very, very clear that we . . . would in no way support coups or
unconstitutional activity," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Administration officials said in public comments that they were
unaware of any discussions of specific coup plans between the Venezuelans
and their American counterparts. But privately, U.S. officials said some
Venezuelans had from time to time raised the possibility of a coup in an
effort to see how the U.S. would treat such an action and the new
government that followed.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's reaction to the abortive coup has come under
increasing scrutiny. Critics have charged that although Chavez has proved
to be an autocratic leader with few friends in the hemisphere, the White
House was too slow to condemn the effort to oust him.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions of a possible ouster raised the sensitive issue of whether
the United States might have in some way given a "green light" that
encouraged the coup attempt. After decades of fostering coups in Latin
America, the United States has more recently led multilateral efforts to
discourage them and promote democracy in the hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's first response Friday to word of Chavez's ouster
was to suggest that the mercurial leader got what he deserved. Officials
of other Western Hemisphere nations, including Mexico, Paraguay and
Argentina, were quicker to condemn the action.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said American aides spelled out their views on a
possible ouster in meetings with Venezuelans at the White House, State
Department and Pentagon, as well as at U.S. facilities in Venezuela. They
said the meetings involved military officials; Venezuelan business, labor
and human rights groups; and members of opposition parties.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials met with Pedro Carmona, the business leader who was
briefly installed as Chavez's successor, but they provided no details,
said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. stance drew sharp criticism from congressional Democrats, who
until now have been quiet on the issue and have been generally reluctant
to attack President Bush's foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters: "I'm very
concerned about what message it sends about our support for democracy
there and around the world. You know, I think that we've got to be
supportive of democratic principles, even when they choose to elect
people we don't like."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd(D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, said he was "extremely
disappointed" in the administration's response to the coup.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was
preoccupied with the Middle East crisis but added, "I would hope that in
the future there would be more adult supervision of the policy
formulation."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats said the administration should have done more to avert
a coup after learning that some Venezuelan officials were considering it.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.), a member of the House
International Relations Committee, said he wondered whether the
administration "should have notified the Chavez government that there
were those who were conspiring to overthrow a democratically elected
government."</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said he was
unconcerned. He said he did not know whether Venezuelan officials had
sought U.S. guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how much of that went on, but I don't have a problem if
it did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lott said Chavez "has not been living up to his promises when he ran
for and was elected president. He has been drifting very markedly to the
left, talking up regimes like Libya and, of course, giving cut-rate oil
prices to Cuba."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Venezuelan military officials have had a close relationship
over the decades, although that has been interrupted since 1998, when
Chavez was elected by a landslide. Chavez has restricted contacts between
the two militaries.</TE>
<TE>   Two senior Venezuelan officers who backed the ouster, former army
commander Gen. Efrain Vasquez and Gen. Eddie Ramirez Poveda, had attended
the U.S. Army School of the Americas at Ft. Benning, Ga., according to
School of the Americas Watch, an advocacy group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that foreign officers trained at the school sometimes
went on to commit human rights violations in their home countries.</TE>

<HD>Temple Blast May Have Been Planned</HD>
<DH>Tunisia: Explosion at old synagogue that killed 16 appears to have
been deliberate, officials in several nations say. Man is detained in
Germany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>A truck explosion that killed 16 people outside a synagogue in
Tunisia last week looks increasingly like it might have been a terrorist
act, authorities in Germany, France and Tunisia said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tunisian authorities at first insisted that the truck containing
natural gas blew up accidentally, but German prosecutors say an
accelerating criminal investigation indicates that the April 11 blast on
the resort island of Djerba was a deliberate attack.</LD>
<LD>   German police detained a suspect in Duisburg late Monday as they
conducted searches in several cities near Duesseldorf. Prosecutors
targeted the man because he allegedly spoke by phone with the gas truck's
driver shortly before the explosion.</LD>
<TE>   "The reason for starting investigations in Germany was a tip from
Tunisian officials that the suspected perpetrator made a telephone call
to Germany a few hours before the deliberate attack," the federal
prosecutor's office said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not identify the detained man. They questioned him
Tuesday and released him because they found no "urgent suspicion" that
would enable them to hold him under German law. However, they said the
investigation was continuing.</TE>
<TE>   "There are increasing suspicions that this was an attack," said
Interior Minister Otto Schily, announcing that he had dispatched five
more investigators to Tunisia. The blast killed 10 German tourists, four
Tunisians and two French citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The Tunisian government appeared to back down Tuesday from its
description of the explosion as an accident. The official Tunisian news
agency said investigators were "ruling out no lead and no direction,
including possible links that the suspect could have had with elements
established in Germany."</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the truck had lived with relatives in Lyon, France, the
news agency said, but it didn't identify him further. The Tunisian
government also referred to a recent spate of anti-Semitic attacks in
France and other European countries spurred by Israel's military
operations in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Like German officials, French authorities have doubts about the
accident theory and have asked to be kept informed about the
investigation, said Bernard Valero, a spokesman for the French Foreign
Ministry. The French government has not opened a criminal investigation,
but the law permits such a probe when French citizens are victims,
according to a law enforcement official here.</TE>
<TE>   French and German tourists who survived the explosion at the Ghriba
synagogue, the oldest in Africa, have said in interviews that they are
convinced that they were victims of an intentional attack. Their accounts
have not resolved the question of whether the truck crashed into the
building before exploding or erupted in flames in a no-parking zone.</TE>
<TE>   The driver is believed to have died in the blast. Three German victims
are still hospitalized in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Two Arab newspapers on Tuesday reported a claim that the explosion was
an attack carried out by an Islamic group tied to the Al Qaeda terrorist
network. A self-described member of the Islamic Army for the Liberation
of the Holy Sites called the newspapers and said the attack was
retaliation for the Israeli operation in the Palestinian territories,
according to the London-based Arab dailies Al Quds al Arabi and Al Hayat.</TE>
<TE>   The same name was used by the group that took responsibility for the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Al Qaeda
members have been convicted in U.S. courts for those bombings. Al Qaeda's
stated goal is to drive U.S. troops out of Saudi Arabia, because their
presence is considered a defilement of Islamic holy sites there.</TE>
<TE>   Aspects of the Djerba case resemble past plots by Al Qaeda. The
suspicion that an accomplice in Germany was involved recalls the Sept. 11
attacks in the United States, which were allegedly led by a terrorist
cell based in Hamburg. Duisburg, the city where the suspect was detained
Monday, also was the base of an Algerian terrorist cell linked to Ahmed
Ressam, who was convicted in a 1999 plot to bomb Los Angeles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Accused Tunisian members of Al Qaeda who spent time in France, Germany
and Belgium played leading roles in several alleged terrorist
conspiracies, including the assassination of the anti-Taliban military
commander Ahmed Shah Masoud in Afghanistan on Sept. 9.</TE>
<TE>   If the Djerba explosion turns out to be the work of terrorists linked
to Al Qaeda, it would be the bloodiest such attack since Sept. 11. Among
other acts perceived as retaliation for the U.S. military campaign in
Afghanistan were the March grenade attack on worshipers in a church in
Pakistan in which five people, including two Americans and the bomber,
died, and the killing of U.S. reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan.</TE>

Opponents say the move runs afoul of Japan's post-World War II pacifist

<HD>Ex-Rebel Sweeps to Victory in East Timor</HD>
<DH>Asia: U.N. authorities announce that Jose Alexandre Gusmao has won
the territory's first presidential vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DILI, East Timor
</DL>
<LD>Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao has won East Timor's first
presidential election, completing his transformation from a poet to a
gun-toting guerrilla commander to a respected statesman.</LD>
<LD>   The popular 55-year-old Gusmao has been the symbol of East Timor's
struggle for independence since the former Portuguese colony was invaded
by Indonesia in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   Gusmao's long-expected landslide victory was formalized today when the
U.N. electoral commission announced that he had won 82.7% of the 378,538
votes cast in Sunday's ballot.</LD>
<TE>   His sole challenger, Francisco Xavier do Amaral, took 17.3%. Remaining
ballots from Sunday's election were ruled invalid.</TE>
<TE>   "We won," said Milena Pires, Gusmao's campaign manager. "We have
around 80% already, which is an excellent achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Do Amaral, who said he was running only to provide the electorate a
choice, had no immediate plans to concede defeat, his supporters said.</TE>
<TE>   The elections are the final step in East Timor's long and bloody
struggle to break free of foreign rule. On May 20, it will become the
world's newest nation when its transitional U.N. administration formally
hands over the running of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Gusmao joined East Timor's independence movement in 1974 after a coup
in Lisbon spelled the end of Portuguese rule.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, he was a fun-loving young man in the colony's capital,
Dili. His nickname, Xanana, he says, is derived from the American rock
'n' roll group Sha Na Na.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote poetry and was goalkeeper for a soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   During Indonesia's 1975 invasion, Gusmao fled to the mountains with
the pro-independence guerrilla group Falintil, a Portuguese acronym for
the Armed Forces of the National Liberation of East Timor.</TE>
<TE>   Although the rebels mounted fierce resistance, they were badly
outgunned by the Indonesian military. About 200,000 people died in the
invasion and ensuing guerrilla war. Gusmao assumed command in 1981 after
Falintil's leaders died.</TE>
<TE>   Gusmao was captured in 1992 in what Indonesia portrayed as a deathblow
to the independence movement.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gusmao continued the campaign from a jail in Jakarta and
quickly became Indonesia's most famous political prisoner. He was
released in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Killings by Parents on Decline, County Says</HD>
<DH>Violence: Deaths drop to 35 in 2000. Study says better
reporting of abuse is preventing slayings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reported killings of children by their parents in Los Angeles County
declined to their lowest number in more than a decade, an encouraging
sign that the general public is more vigilant about reporting
possible abuse cases before they turn fatal, says an annual report
being released today.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-five children were killed by their parents or caretakers in
2000, the last year for which full statistics were available, down
from 44 the year before, according to the county's Interagency
Council on Child Abuse and Neglect. The 2000 child homicide figure,
which covers youngsters under 18 years old, is the lowest since the
group began charting such deaths in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really good news and we haven't had that in quite some
time," said the agency's executive director, Deanne Tilton-Durfee.
"The violent deaths of 35 young children is still too many. But by
virtue of taking the mask off this issue, we have seen a much greater
willingness on the part of friends, family and neighbors to become
involved."</LD>
<TE>   Even more promising are preliminary data from 2001 indicating a
continued downward trend for such child homicides, which had averaged
in the mid-40s for several years, Tilton-Durfee said.</TE>
<TE>   The findings, based on statistics gathered by child abuse experts,
law enforcement and social welfare agencies, provide a detailed
analysis of slayings by caregivers, accidental deaths, youth suicides
and abuse reports.</TE>
<TE>   Though overall reports of child abuse were up slightly--to 151,108
from 146,583 the previous year--they remained far below 1997's high
of nearly 200,000 cases.</TE>
<TE>   Accidental deaths of children also rose slightly, to 137 from 134
in 1999. But the increase was attributed in part to a widening of the
age range for that category. The cases included children through age
14 rather than through age 12 as in previous years. The 13- and
14-year-olds accounted for 15 accidental deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Of the accidental deaths reported in 2000, 30 involved pedestrians
hit by automobiles, one fewer than in 1999. Authorities believe that
many of those deaths could have been prevented.</TE>
<TE>   In several cases, unattended children in driveways were run over,
most often by their own relatives.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, a 9-year-old boy in foster care ran away from his
group home with two other youths, bolted onto the freeway and was
struck by an oncoming car.</TE>
<TE>   Suicides declined 15%, to 23 from 27 the previous year. No
children 12 or under committed suicide, unlike in 1999, when a
10-year-old and two 12-year-olds ended their own lives.</TE>
<TE>   But homicides by caregivers remain some of the most perplexing of
crimes for investigators and society.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of children killed are infants under 12 months of
age, the most vulnerable of humanity and virtually powerless to give
voice to any sort of assault that may occur," said Los Angeles County
Sheriff Lee Baca, chairman of the council.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County and across the nation, a girl is most at
risk of fatal injury or homicide by a parent or caretaker during her
first year of life. For boys, the risk is high in the first year and
again in their late teens.</TE>
<TE>   But infants are also the least likely to come in contact with
welfare authorities who could protect them. Only 12% of abuse cases
reported to the county's Department of Children and Family Services
involved children under 2 years of age, and 23% involved children
under 5, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   More family members, friends and others are noticing warning signs
of abuse and reporting them, Tilton-Durfee said.</TE>
<TE>   Their awareness, in part, has been fueled by campaigns such as
those by the Proposition 10-funded California Children and Families
Commission to promote healthy babies and intervene in families in
which domestic violence or substance abuse puts children at risk of
harm.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft recently announced a national
campaign to reduce child abuse deaths by 12% in the next eight years.</TE>
<TE>   In 20 of the 35 homicides reported in 2000, there had been no
previous contact with child welfare authorities.</TE>
<TE>   One means of averting such tragedies, the report says, is
increased cross-reporting of abuse and family crime among police and
child protection agencies.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the Los Angeles city attorney's office--which
prosecutes misdemeanor abuse cases--has begun receiving abuse reports
directly from child welfare authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hope is to try to catch kids who might have fallen through
the cracks," said Donna Edmiston, special assistant for children,
families and school issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking not only to protect children but prosecute
abusers."</TE>

<HD>Ethics Panel Sets Hearing on Holden's Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the objections of Nate Holden, the Los Angeles City Ethics
Commission decided Tuesday to go ahead with a hearing later this
month into alleged campaign contribution violations by the city
councilman.</LD>
<LD>   Holden, appearing before the commission, insisted that he is being
subjected to a tougher standard of enforcement than other members of
the council and suggested that the commission may already have made
up its mind to find him guilty of violations.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I'd be getting due process from this commission,"
Holden said angrily. "But that has not been the case at all. You
haven't even given me proper notice of the proceedings.... If your
mind is already made up, it's a waste of everybody's time to hold a
hearing."</LD>
<TE>   Commission President Miriam Krinsky said Holden has been given
fair treatment and timely notice of all proceedings. She said a
decision on charges against the councilman from his 1999 reelection
contest cannot be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Holden was charged last December by the commission staff of
committing 31 violations in 1999. He faces up to $155,000 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   An audit by the staff concluded that Holden accepted 11
contributions exceeding the city's $500 contribution limit, and then
requested public matching funds by submitting 20 ineligible claims.
Each violation can result in a fine of $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The commission began its session by reviewing a legal memorandum
submitted by Holden's attorney accusing commission hearing officer
Richard E. Drooyan of prejudicial conduct against the councilman in
holding a preliminary hearing into the violations.</TE>
<TE>   The commission decided to give the parties to the case a limited
time to respond to the points made, and directed that Drooyan report
on them to the full commission before the full hearing April 25.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners then spent much of the meeting discussing proposed
changes in the city's campaign contribution rules.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying later before the commission, newly elected City
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel supported reform of election laws to reduce
the impact of independent outside expenditures on city election
contests. She also urged that forfeiture of office be the penalty for
repeated violations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear we need change and we need it now to end political
corruption and conflicts of interest by closing campaign finance
loopholes that have allowed millions of dollars from anonymous
outside interests to influence local elections," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel also supported a change in the law to require people who
run for the City Council to live in the area they will represent for
at least a year before the election.</TE>
<TE>   The commission can only recommend revisions of the law. Revisions
must be approved by the City Council and the mayor in most instances,
and might even require the approval of City Charter provisions by the
electorate.</TE>

<HD>Lockheed to Settle the Final Claims Over Toxins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp. has agreed to pay $1.25 million to settle all
outstanding claims by residents who contend that they were sickened
by decades of chemical contamination at the company's top-secret
Burbank plant known as the Skunk Works, officials announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement ends a contentious six-year legal battle with
Burbank homeowners over lingering toxins at the 300-acre site where
some of the military's best-known aircraft, including the F-117A
stealth fighter, were designed, tested and built.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1996, Lockheed has paid its former neighbors $66 million in
three legal actions over toxic contamination of their properties.
This was the only remaining case.</LD>
<TE>   Residents allege that they suffer from life-threatening diseases,
such as leukemia, because they were exposed to the same toxic
solvents that have contaminated the aquifer under Lockheed's land. It
was declared a federal Superfund cleanup site in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits focused on the dumping of perchloroethylene, or PCE,
and trichloroethylene, or TCE, from the old Lockheed plant into the
air, soil and ground water near their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed denied anyone had been harmed as a result of their
actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that settling for a nominal amount was an appropriate
business decision," company spokeswoman Gail E. Rymer said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Burbank residents, including those in the most recent
settlement, sued Lockheed in 1996 after learning the company had paid
$60 million in secret settlements to 1,357 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed also paid $5 million to more than 300 plaintiffs in a
separate lawsuit in December.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Steven N. Williams, who represented the plaintiffs in the
pending federal case, declined to say how the settlement money would
be distributed.</TE>
<TE>   Williams credited his clients for challenging Lockheed's
environmental practices in the six decades the giant defense
contractor built airplanes in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   "When regular people take on a corporation with the financial and
political resources and power of Lockheed, it's a difficult fight,"
Williams said. "We put everything into this fight."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 40 federal claims against Lockheed were thrown out of
court because the statute of limitations had expired. A jury trial
had begun in late January on three remaining personal-injury claims
and one wrongful-death allegation. But after two weeks the trial was
halted when U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer broke her hip.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, the parties were urged to settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   A second trial had been scheduled for a plaintiff who complained
of property damage caused by Lockheed's alleged negligent handling of
toxins.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs who reached settlements have agreed not to appeal the
court's rulings or seek further damages from Lockheed. Besides civil
lawsuits, Lockheed has paid more than $265 million since the late
1980s to clean up underground drinking-water supplies, and company
officials said they could spend as much as $100 million more in the
next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed moved its operations out of Burbank in the early 1990s
after its merger with Martin Marietta. The company is now based in
Bethesda, Md.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Reform Goes Unenforced</HD>
<DH>Politics: Santa Monica, Pasadena and Claremont delay action
on voter- passed limits on gifts or jobs to officials whose actions
aided the giver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The people spoke, but those in power didn't listen.</LD>
<LD>   So say proponents of a controversial campaign finance initiative
passed by voters in three Los Angeles County cities more than a year
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders in the cities--Santa Monica, Pasadena and Claremont--say
the initiative infringes on the civil rights of elected officials,
and they want the courts to declare the law unconstitutional. None of
the cities is enforcing the law.</LD>
<TE>   Now a Pasadena man has sued his city to force it to complete the
necessary paperwork to get the law on the books--a process that
typically takes no more than five days.</TE>
<TE>   The law, promoted by the Santa Monica-based Oaks Initiative,
requires elected and appointed officials to refuse campaign
donations, gifts or jobs from anyone to whom they have granted a
substantial "public benefit."</TE>
<TE>   The law in Pasadena and Claremont restricts officials for five
years after voting to grant such a benefit or a year after leaving
office, and in Santa Monica six years after voting for a benefit or
two years after leaving office.</TE>
<TE>   Benefits are defined as contracts or exceptions, such as zoning
variances, valued at more than $50,000 in Santa Monica or $25,000 in
Pasadena and Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena resident Rene Amy says he doesn't really care what the
initiative said. Frankly, he can't even remember how he voted on the
measure. But he says it's up to the courts, not city officials, to
decide if a law is valid.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell people, 'Your vote counts,'" Amy said. "But the city
fathers and mothers are basically telling voters, 'No, no, no.'"</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena asked a judge Monday and again Tuesday to declare the law
unconstitutional and to set aside Amy's lawsuit, said Michelle Beal
Bagneris, city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena voters approved the measure in March 2001. The city did
nothing and, according to a June 6, 2001, memorandum, Bagneris
instructed the city clerk to wait another three months before filing
the charter amendment to enact the law.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Bagneris said, she believed a decision on the
validity of the law was imminent. If the city clerk enforced the law,
she wrote, "officials could be forced to spend time and money
defending themselves against lawsuits brought to remedy 'violations'
of an unconstitutional law."</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unduly costly for the city to install the
computer-based administrative system to operate under this ordinance,
especially if the law will be declared unconstitutional," said
Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaart. He said the estimate was more than
$200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Balber, Oaks Project director, said the initiative fills a
void left by the 1974 Political Reform Act, which limits campaign
donations and gifts that candidates for state office may receive. The
group, the grass-roots organizing unit of the Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights, trains citizens to be involved in politics.</TE>
<TE>   Many municipalities passed local campaign finance limits after the
1974 act, Balber said. The Oaks initiative goes one step further,
banning gifts to those who vote in favor of a contract because it's
hard to prove in court that a donation is quid pro quo, said Robert
Fellmeth, director of the Center for Public Interest Law.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you can do it is by taping people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This initiative is unusual because it puts the responsibility on
public officials rather than givers, Balber said. But critics say
that an outright donation ban is unnecessary, and that it wrongly
singles out elected officials who vote in favor of contracts. Someone
could also benefit from a no vote.</TE>
<TE>   "It's burning the barn to roast the pig," said John Ramirez, an
attorney for several initiative cases.</TE>
<TE>   It may also violate the 1st Amendment, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a
USC law professor.</TE>
<TE>   He said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that political
contributions are political speech and protected under the 1st
Amendment. Although the court has not ruled specifically on a
complete ban on campaign donations, it has stated that limits must be
reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Although the law has not been enforced in Claremont, Santa Monica
and Pasadena, it has already had an impact in those cities.</TE>
<TE>   After two Claremont city commissioners resigned to avoid questions
of conflict of interest, the council passed a resolution indemnifying
any elected or appointed official sued under this law.</TE>
<TE>   John Seery, Pomona College's politics department chairman, sat
through many long meetings about sewer services as a volunteer
community services commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   But Seery decided he had to step down because the college often
contracted with the city.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the law, "my right to participate in civic life in
Claremont had been sabotaged," he said. "Serving as commissioner
implicated me in many affairs of the college that would not normally
come under conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   "Our commissioners should not have to be concerned by the
restrictions of the ordinance," Claremont Mayor Paul Held said. "Good
and qualified people will be discouraged" from entering civic life.</TE>
<TE>   Claremont and Pasadena tried to join a suit filed by Santa Monica
against the law. Santa Monica, where the Oaks measure passed in
November 2000, took the unusual step of suing its own city clerk to
get a ruling on the law's merits. On March 29, a Superior Court judge
dismissed the case on procedural grounds, but left the door open for
an appeal. Santa Monica plans to file an appeal or wait for the
outcome of Amy's case in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The only California city not challenging the measure is San
Francisco. Its ethics commission adopted regulations for the
initiative in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The weight is for the public official to comply with this
requirement," said Mabel Ng, the commission's deputy executive
director.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints are kept confidential, but Ng does not know of any that
were filed based on this law.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes a gardener can be too proud. Take the case of the L.A. man
who was arrested after he took a roll of film to a drugstore. Seems
the photos documented the growth of his marijuana crop.</LD>
<LD>   Traveler's note: After reading mentions here of the villages of
Barf, England, and Orgy, France, Judi Birnberg wrote: "I drove
through a Portuguese town called Chaos, although things seemed quite
peaceful at the time." Speaking of unusual names, Fred Miller was
motoring through rural Pennsylvania when he saw a street sign that
was in need of a checkup (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   From Barf to blah: While Sara Olberg of Tujunga noticed a somewhat
derisive page heading in a San Fernando Valley phone directory, I'm
sure the publication wasn't implying that the Valley is a
less-than-exciting place (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Twins separated at birth? Catherine Karklyn snapped a shot of two
banks that occupy the same building on Fairfax Avenue and could be
having identity crises (see photo). California National Bank moved in
after it bought People's Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Webbed sight: It was Marilyn Cagle who notified this column about
the mother duck that brazenly walked across the San Diego Freeway
with a dozen young ones in West L.A. one recent morning. While a
California Highway Patrol officer was halting traffic for the
feathery jaywalkers, she was amazed at how calm commuters were. (By
"she" I mean Cagle; the mother duck seemed to show no concern.)
Anyway, Cagle got to wondering afterward what happened to the
creatures.</TE>
<TE>   She phoned the CHP and was told that the officer had released the
ducks on their own recognizance to the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation
Area in Baldwin Hills. That proved a bit of an adventure too. "After
the officer drove off," Cagle said, "he heard some peeping in his
car. Evidently, one of the ducklings had hidden under the seat, so he
had to return and let him out with the rest."</TE>
<TE>   Dog daze: Marilyn Stein, an athletic-looking resident of Pacific
Palisades, was shopping there when a woman asked her: "Who's your
trainer?" The woman meant who was the trainer of Stein's dog, Sammy.
This is an L.A. trend that Stein hadn't heard about: dog trainers who
are making house calls.</TE>
<TE>   What struck Stein as somewhat absurd is that Sammy is hardly a
designer dog, being a mutt--and one who is not all that slim. In
fact, Sammy required no training to learn a favorite trick: begging
at the dinner table for scraps.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I thought The Times picked an appropriate day--Monday,
April 15--to publish Tom Maugh's fascinating piece about King
Scorpion of ancient Egypt. It was Scorpion who may have ordered the
development of writing more than 5,000 years ago. Why? One theory
holds that he wanted to record the payment of taxes by his subjects.
I wonder if the king allowed extensions?</TE>

<HD>The Less-Than-Lovely Side of Gloria Molina</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Happy? Oh, try again. I was thrilled to read in my very own paper
that Gloria Molina, the Los Angeles County supervisor, and her
husband, Ron Martinez, had put up an illegal retaining wall at their
house.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just the wall I admire--it's the attitude. For more than
10 years, the couple had snubbed inspectors, ignored fines and now,
according to Peter Hong reporting in today's paper, it seems they may
have put in a swimming pool without a permit in a yard being
supported by that illegal wall.</LD>
<LD>   Peeved, are you? Boy, not me. The lid is off, baby. It's R-1
independence day at my house, which is maybe a mile from Molina's. No
more time-consuming permits. What, the world needs more paper? With
the Molina example before me, it's now full speed ahead on all of the
home improvement projects I've ever dreamed about.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday morning, it all goes in: the neon-lights trim on the
roofline, the clock tower that plays "It's a Small World" on the
quarter-hour, the Morrison family mausoleum and gift shop, the
home-hobby alligator-hatching pond. And, oh, yes, the gun range, so I
don't lose my touch with a Glock.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the thing about Gloria Molina. She is smart as new paint
and tough as shoe leather, or she wouldn't be what she is, which is a
Los Angeles County supervisor, a major-league player with more
constituents, fatter budgets and bigger policy messes than some
governors.</TE>
<TE>   She made herself into a force majeure as Assembly member, City
Council member and now supervisor. She's got the muscle to deliver
the goods to her district and her supporters, and the Molina Machine
can raise money and raise hell with the best of them. Mention
"Gloria" in the official ZIP Codes of L.A., and everyone knows who
you mean. All this she's done in spite of a double-barreled load of
macho flak, political and cultural, and sexist cracks that get zinged
out of Molina's earshot.</TE>
<TE>   So if she sometimes breezes through the 10-items-or-fewer line at
our local market with 12 or 13 things--which really galls my
neighbor, who's seen her do it--well, we all have our lapses.</TE>
<TE>   But to be a supervisor, to be a politician, is to be tempted to
believe your own clippings, and to believe that everyone else does
too.</TE>
<TE>   Gil Garcetti, before he became D.A., built a house whose garage
was too close to the property line. The neighbors said it looked like
an atomic energy plant. They banded together and saw to it that
Garcetti was ordered to tear down half of the offending 22 extra
feet.</TE>
<TE>   And Mike Woo, the city councilman who drafted the hillside rules
that now govern neighborhoods like Molina's, remodeled his Silver
Lake home without some of the safety features that would soon be
required by that very proposed law.</TE>
<TE>   But that's Lincoln Log play. Hong's stories about the Great Wall
of Mount Washington chronicle 10 years of building codes flouted, 10
written repair orders ignored, $3,710 in fines and fees unpaid.</TE>
<TE>   Mount Washington looks illogical on a map and impossible in
person. Some roads are still dirt; most are narrow and steep and
corkscrewed. There are almost no sidewalks. It's one of L.A.'s oldest
neighborhoods, originally a getaway of canyons and cabins, and a
legacy of odd-shaped lots and odder buildings. From the street,
houses like Molina's--sleek and white--give no clue what's back
behind there, which is how a pool or a wall could go unseen.</TE>
<TE>   The word from City Hall is that there was no special treatment
here. Meetings between an aide to then-City Atty. James Hahn and the
head of the Building and Safety Department ... a note from Molina on
city stationery ... an assist from a city councilman ... an inspector
who Molina's husband believed was politically biased being
replaced.... Oh, yeah, that happens to me all the time.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder neighbors were afraid to complain--about the pool, the
wall, or the debris from the house across the street being remodeled
by Molina and Martinez. No wonder inspectors worried about their
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "No special treatment." When Hong went to see the file on Tuesday,
a public record in a public place, he was told they didn't have to
show it to him.</TE>
<TE>   For Molina and Martinez to try to cut corners and throw some
weight behind it is a less-than-</TE>
<TE>   lovely side of human nature, not unlike getting into the 10-item
line at the market with 12 or 13 things.</TE>
<TE>   For the city to knuckle under to that threatens more than a few
houses that might be at risk from a suspect retaining wall. It
threatens the cornerstone of credibility and fairness that government
operates on.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes it doesn't take an earthquake to shake and crack a
foundation. A file full of papers can do the job quite nicely.</TE>

<CX>   Garcetti garage--The Patt Morrison column in Wednesday's California
section said that in the 1980s, then-Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was ordered
to tear down part of a garage built too close to the property line. After
issuing that order, however, the city ruled that it had erred and had
given Garcetti a permit for the garage. As a result, the city relented on
its order and granted Garcetti a variance to let the garage remain as
built.</CX>

<HD>Kidnap-Slaying Victim Was Subject of IRS Probe</HD>
<DH>Crime: Her attorney doubts inquiry is linked to her
disappearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the five apparent kidnapping victims whose bodies were found
in a Northern California lake was the target of a federal criminal
investigation when she disappeared in December from the Los Angeles
area, court documents show.</LD>
<LD>   Rita Pekler and her attorney said in a deposition that she was
under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service for alleged tax
fraud. The deposition was taken in a related civil case six days
before Pekler vanished.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney, Stanley Friedman, confirmed on Tuesday that the IRS
was investigating Pekler. But he said he did not believe the
investigation had anything to do with her kidnapping and killing.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it was just an unfortunate coincidence," Friedman said.
He added that the investigation involved "improper [tax] deductions"
taken by clients of Pekler's check-cashing business, Professional
Business Development.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for the IRS, FBI and U.S. attorney's office either
declined to comment or did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the bodies of Pekler, Beverly Hills businessman George
Safiev and Nick Kharabadze, an aspiring film producer from Woodland
Hills, were found in New Melones Lake in Calaveras County, along with
that of North Hollywood businessman Alexander Umansky. The body of
Meyer Muscatel, a Sherman Oaks real estate developer, was found in
the lake in October, his hands bound and his head in a plastic bag.</TE>
<TE>   Six defendants, all with roots in Eastern Europe, have been
charged in connection with two of the kidnappings. Federal
authorities have said that more charges might be filed. A seventh
suspect is being sought in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Pekler had been the bookkeeper for defendants Mike Orlov and Villi
Weiss in the civil suit that was about to go to trial early this
year, court documents show. She would have been one of the key
witnesses called by plaintiff Allstate Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   The case has been postponed because of the IRS investigation,
which also has targeted Orlov and Weiss, said their attorney, Tracy
Green.</TE>
<TE>   Orlov and Weiss, who ran a medical management company, "had
nothing to do with [Pekler's kidnapping and killing]," Green said.
"There was no bad blood between my clients and her.... They're
horrified about this, as is the rest of the Russian community.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI has not even interviewed my clients," Green added.</TE>
<TE>   In her Nov. 30 deposition, Pekler repeatedly invoked her 5th
Amendment right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether she recognized the names of Orlov, Weiss or her
bookkeeping and check-cashing businesses, she replied: "I take the
5th."</TE>

<LD>A man who allegedly backed a stolen car into a sheriff's deputy while
trying to flee was shot to death early Tuesday by another deputy,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Eddie Dominguez, 27, died about 2:10 a.m. outside the Travel Inn
Motel in the 11100 block of Whittier Boulevard, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Deputy Sonia Parra. A woman in the car was
questioned but was not arrested. An assault rifle was recovered from
the car, Parra said.</LD>
<LD>   A deputy had stopped the driver in the parking lot after he
spotted the rifle, Parra said. Other deputies ordered the man and
woman out of the car, she said.</LD>
<TE>   The suspect then started backing the car up, Parra said. Deputies
struggled with the man through the window, she said. A deputy was
struck, then other deputies opened fire, Parra said. The injured
deputy was not seriously hurt.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents Tuesday raided the residences
of Carson Mayor Daryl Sweeney and City Councilwoman Raunda Frank,
looking for evidence of an unspecified crime.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the FBI in Los Angeles, Laura Bosley, would not
comment on the reasons for the searches, stating that a court had
ordered that the search warrant affidavits, which ordinarily set out
law enforcement officers' suspicions, be sealed.</LD>
<LD>   A third warrant was served Tuesday on the Gardena office of
Browning-Ferris Industries, which recently won an exclusive
commercial waste-hauling contract in Carson with the support of
Sweeney and Frank.</LD>
<TE>   The contract award process became enmeshed in controversy when it
was revealed that a lawyer, employed both as a consultant by BFI and
as an attorney for the city, faxed BFI secret bid information that a
rival hauler had supplied to the city.</TE>
<TE>   BFI on Tuesday referred an inquiry to its publicly traded parent
company, Allied Waste Industries in Scottsdale, Ariz. Allied's vice
president for investor relations, Michael Burnett, would say only
that BFI officials were cooperating in the search. He said the
company was not in a position to comment on what the agents were
looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney was at City Hall on Tuesday night for a regularly
scheduled council meeting, but the meeting was canceled because only
two of the five council members showed up. He declined an interview
request through the city's public information officer, Evangeline
Gaitlin.</TE>
<TE>   Frank did not appear for the council meeting and could not be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Council members and the mayor serve part time in Carson. Sweeney
is employed full time as chief of staff to Los Angeles City
Councilwoman Jan Perry. Frank is a deputy Los Angeles County public
defender.</TE>

<HD>Rally Draws 500 Jewish Students</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To link the violence in the Middle East to their lives in the United
States, more than 500 students from Jewish schools in Los Angeles
assembled Tuesday to remember Americans killed in Israel and call on
the U.S. government to prosecute Palestinians who harm Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The gathering of six Orthodox middle and high schools at B'nai
David-Judea synagogue on Pico Boulevard was more solemn than recent
rallies and demonstrations by American Jews in cities nationwide. The
second annual assembly corresponded on the Jewish calendar to Yom
HaZikaron, a day reserved for honoring those killed by enemies of
Israel and Jews.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing about four Americans killed in Israel, the students
wrote letters to California's congressional delegation, urging
members to establish an office to monitor attacks by Palestinians or
anyone acting on behalf of Palestinian organizations.</LD>
<TE>   The Koby Mandell Act, which is in congressional committees, would
authorize rewards for information leading to the arrests of suspected
terrorists. The legislation is named for a Maryland 14-year-old who
was stoned to death last year in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "The American government has to protect its citizens no matter
where they are," said Aviva Robin, a senior at Yeshiva University of
Los Angeles High School.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Americans remembered, Shoshana Hayman Greenbaum,
graduated from Yeshiva, known as YULA, and taught at Emek Hebrew
Academy in Sherman Oaks, which was represented at Tuesday's assembly.
Greenbaum, 31, was killed in August in a suicide bombing at a
Jerusalem pizzeria. Her father, Alan Hayman, shared memories of the
teacher on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Large photographs at the front of the synagogue also showed
Mandell; 14-year-old Yael Botwin, who grew up in Claremont and died
in a 1997 bombing in Jerusalem; and Yitzhak Weinstock, a Los Angeles
rabbi's grandson, who was killed in a drive-by shooting near
Jerusalem in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "These people were regular people just like you and me, and they
were killed while they were living their everyday lives," said Ayelet
Fischer, a senior at YULA who organized the assembly.</TE>
<TE>   For Fischer, her classmates and students from Emek, Shalhevet High
School and Maimonides Academy in West Hollywood, West Valley Hebrew
Academy in Woodland Hills and Hillel Harkham Academy in Beverly
Hills, the events in Israel have personal meaning. They have
relatives there, siblings serve in its army, and many of the Los
Angeles students hope to spend a year in Israel before college.</TE>
<TE>   The bloody strife between Israelis and Palestinians is "on
everyone's minds, constantly," said senior Liz Shrier, who would like
to join the Israeli army before entering Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we don't live in Israel," she said, "we live a life
of fear."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Offers New IDs in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Immigrants: The digital version of the matricula consular
is billed as theft-proof. The foreign minister will unveil them in
Los Angeles today.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As California's governor and Legislature debate issuing driver's
licenses to undocumented immigrants, Mexican consulates around the
country are offering a new theft-proof version of its matricula
consular identification cards.</LD>
<LD>   The new cards, now available in Santa Ana, Dallas, New York and
Chicago, will be formally introduced today in Los Angeles by Mexico's
foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda. The cards, which are digital like
California identification cards and driver's licenses, include a
hologram to prevent fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Castaneda's trip to introduce the cards demonstrates the Mexican
government's emphasis on the importance of Mexican immigrants,
particularly undocumented ones, having valid identification in a more
security-conscious United States. It also represents an investment of
several million dollars in equipment in consular offices across the
nation, which have been besieged with requests for matriculas since
Sept. 11. The identification cards have been renamed the "high
security consular ID."</LD>
<TE>   "The Mexican government is very interested in this document that
it become a secure, true form of identification in the United
States," said Agustin Pradillo, spokesman for the Mexican Consulate
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, where acceptance of the matricula as identification
raised concerns among anti-immigration advocates, police say they are
pleased with the new card even though no one knows of any fraud with
the old ones.</TE>
<TE>   "It is less susceptible to being counterfeited ... so we are all
for this," Anaheim police spokesman Mike Hidalgo said. "We were
concerned that as soon as the matricula consular was recognized as a
form of identification it could be counterfeited just like the
others."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police began accepting the matricula at the urging of
immigrant rights advocates after many undocumented people were
deported for minor traffic violations when they couldn't show valid
identification.</TE>
<TE>   The identification issue has taken on greater importance as Gov.
Gray Davis reconsiders his initial veto of a bill to allow the
undocumented to get driver's licenses, a universally accepted form of
identification. Immigrant rights advocates have argued that
preventing them from having licenses imposes an economic hardship in
a state where the automobile is the primary method of transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the consulate in Santa Ana cranked up its new digital
card system this week, charging $29, the same fee as before.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government has urged its 48 consulates in the United
States to promote the ID cards for the estimated 3 million
undocumented Mexicans living in the U.S. Some banks, law enforcement
agencies and businesses already accept them as legal forms of
identification.</TE>
<TE>   Castaneda is making a one-day trip to Los Angeles and San
Francisco after Mexico's Congress voted last week to bar President
Vicente Fox going on a three-day trip to the U.S. and Canada,
including a stop in San Francisco to introduce the identity cards.</TE>

<HD>Hacker to Be Key in Trial of Judge</HD>
<DH>Courts: Attorneys for Ronald Kline of Irvine argue that
Canadian police had doubts about child porn informant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two months before child pornography charges were filed against an
Orange County judge, Canadian authorities expressed "serious doubt"
about the work of a hacker who allegedly discovered illegal
photographs on the jurist's home computer, according to court
documents filed this week.</LD>
<LD>   Police used the information from the unidentified hacker to obtain
a search warrant for Judge Ronald C. Kline's home in Irvine, where
they allegedly found more than 1,500 computer images of child porn.</LD>
<LD>   The credibility of the hacker--and whether he violated the judge's
constitutional rights--are expected to be key elements in Kline's
upcoming federal trial.</LD>
<TE>   Kline's attorneys argued in court documents filed Monday that a
Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigator told Irvine police that
the hacker, who lives in Canada, was breaking the law and could not
be used as an informant.</TE>
<TE>   "Our problem is how do we continue to receive information from him
with the knowledge that the method he is using to extract the
information identifying the bad guys is illegal," wrote Investigator
George Barnett in a Sept. 6 e-mail to an Irvine detective.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some expectation of privacy on the part of the bad
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine police, however, contend that defense attorneys have quoted
the e-mail out of context. Investigators said the hacker's methods
are irrelevant to the case because he was not acting as an agent of
law enforcement when he hacked into Kline's computer.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett's e-mail, they said, discussed the possible legal problems
investigators would face if they used future tips from the hacker.</TE>
<TE>   "It had nothing to do with the Kline investigation," Irvine Police
Det. Ron Carr said. "It was a conversation between us about using him
[the hacker] in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett said through a police spokesman that he could not comment
while the case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Kline, 61, has pleaded not guilty to six charges of possessing
child pornography. He also pleaded not guilty to separate state
charges of molesting a 14-year-old boy more than two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest federal court filing, Kline's attorneys said that
others also questioned the hacker's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The head of Predator-Hunter, a Cleveland-based Internet watchdog
group that claimed the hacker as an informant, expressed concerns
about the hacker to Irvine police.</TE>
<TE>   Predator-Hunter's founder, Michael Vaughan, wrote to Carr in

<HD>Masry's Son Plans to Run for Moorpark Council</HD>
<DH>Politics: The offspring of the Thousand Oaks mayor
maintains that he isn't capitalizing on his father's name.</DH>

<LD>There are the Kennedys. The Bushes. The Masrys?</LD>
<LD>   Just as the nation has its political dynasties, Ventura County may
soon spin off one of its own.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Masry, the gruff, shaggy-haired trial lawyer depicted in the
film "Erin Brockovich," made a foray into politics in 2000 with a
self-funded campaign for the Thousand Oaks City Council. Within a
year, he was mayor.</LD>
<TE>   Now Masry's son, Louis, is planning a run for the City Council in
neighboring Moorpark, population 31,000, where he will move into a
new house this week with his wife and their two young children.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old financial advisor and restaurateur said he expects
some to call him a carpetbagger or accuse him of running on his
father's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   But Louis Masry, who in 1998 donated $10,000 to Save Open Space
and Agricultural Resources, the county's anti-sprawl political
movement, maintains that he is his own man.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to live in Moorpark, we want to be involved in the
process in the city," he said. The Masrys have purchased a
five-bedroom house; they had been living in a smaller home in a gated
community just outside the Thousand Oaks city limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly slow-growth, like my father, but the one thing I
don't want people to say is that I'm running on my father's coattails
or anything like that," Louis Masry said. "I pay for my own home, I
pay my own bills, I support my own family and I have my own ideas."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Masry said he is running to ensure that Moorpark
maintains a slow-growth mentality. He also wants to reduce truck
traffic through town, a goal that has proved elusive to incumbents
because federal and state agencies control the roads in question.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Masry admits trying to influence his son once or twice in years
past. In Louis' bachelor days, for example, the elder Masry said he
tried to talk his son into breaking up with a girlfriend who "had
taken 'hippie' to the extreme." But Masry said he wouldn't try to
influence his son's political decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Now 69, Masry said he will retire from the Thousand Oaks council
when his term ends in 2004. But he would like to see his children
carry on the new family tradition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Louis Masry's plans, Ed Masry said his daughters,
Louanne Masry-Weeks and Nicole Masry-McAdam, both in their 30s and
living in Agoura Hills, have said they may run for local office in
the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   "They're definitely interested," Ed Masry said.</TE>

<LD>There are the Kennedys. The Bushes. The Masrys?</LD>
<LD>   Just as the nation has its political dynasties, Ventura County may
soon spin off one of its own.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Masry, the gruff, shaggy-haired trial lawyer depicted in the
film "Erin Brockovich," forayed into politics in 2000 with a
self-funded campaign for the Thousand Oaks City Council. Within a
year, he was mayor.</LD>
<TE>   Now Masry's son, Louis, is planning a run for the City Council in

new house this week with his wife and their two young children.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old financial advisor and restaurateur said he expects
some to call him a carpetbagger or accuse him of running on his
father's reputation. But Louis Masry, who in 1998 donated $10,000 to
Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources, the county's anti-sprawl
political movement, maintains that he is his own man.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to live in Moorpark, we want to be involved in the
process in the city," he said. The couple have purchased a
five-bedroom house; they had been living in a smaller home just
outside Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly slow-growth, like my father, but the one thing I

pay my own bills, I support my own family and I have my own ideas."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Masry said he is running to ensure that Moorpark
maintains a slow-growth mentality. He also wants to reduce truck
traffic through town, a goal that has proved elusive to incumbents
because federal and state agencies control the roads in question.</TE>
<TE>   If Louis Masry runs in November, he might face the two council
members up for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   John Wozniak, a warehouse supervisor for the Moorpark Unified
School District who describes himself as a "controlled-growth"
advocate, was elected in 1990. He drew heat from slow-growth
activists in 1998 after he switched his vote to approve the
3,221-home Hidden Creek development, later stymied by litigation. The
project, which would have boosted the city's population by one-third,
galvanized SOAR activists to pass a Moorpark slow-growth initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Harper, chairman of the physics, astronomy and engineering
department at Moorpark College, was elected in 1998 after gaining
exposure as a backer of Moorpark's SOAR initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Wozniak nor Harper has announced whether reelection will
be sought. Neither knows Louis Masry, but both say his bid is
premature.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a problem with someone moving into a city and saying, 'I
can do a better job than anyone who's in the city,'" Wozniak said.
"He may be a very good guy. But you need to pay your dues first."</TE>
<TE>   Harper said he is a fan of Ed Masry, who, with his researcher
Brockovich, won a $333-million settlement for residents in Hinkley,
Calif., in a ground-water pollution case against Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric.</TE>
<TE>   If Louis Masry shares his father's environmental convictions,
Harper said, he would probably like him too. Still, he said, voters
may see Louis Masry "as a guy with a rich dad who wants to buy his
way into office."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd welcome him to the community," Harper said. "But I urge him
to stick around for a while and get a feel for the culture and the
background first. If you come in from left field, you may make a fool
out of yourself. A well-intentioned newcomer can be a real detriment
to the city."</TE>
<TE>   Louis Masry countered that, as a newcomer, "I don't owe anybody
any favors." He also said his involvement in SOAR and with campaigns
for his father and Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks gave him
grounding in the issues that face eastern Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Masry admits trying to influence his son once or twice in years
past. In Louis' bachelor days, the elder Masry said he tried to talk
his son into breaking up with a girlfriend who "had taken 'hippie' to
the extreme." But Masry said he wouldn't try to influence his son's
political decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Now 69, Masry said he will retire from the Thousand Oaks council
when his term ends in 2004. But he would like to see his children
carry on the new family tradition, he said. In addition to Louis
Masry's plans, Ed Masry said his daughters, Louanne Masry-Weeks and
Nicole Masry-McAdam, both living in Agoura Hills, have said they may
run for local office in next few years.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Metrolink Is on a Roll</HD>
<DH>Rail service: Tenth station is set to open Friday with two
more in the works. Goal is to get more south county commuters off
roads.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a decade of planning, the Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo
Metrolink station will open Friday, the 10th platform along Orange
County's rail line.</LD>
<LD>   The $9.8-million facility is expected to take pressure off the
popular and congested San Juan Capistrano and Irvine rail stations,
Orange County Transportation Authority officials said. The hope is
that it will also convince more South County commuters to use public
transportation.</LD>
<LD>   The depot is a fully automated station--there are no employees.
Located on Forbes Road just south of Crown Valley Parkway, it will
have 300 parking spaces and four electric-vehicle charging stations.
Two more Metrolink stations, one in Buena Park and another in Yorba
Linda, should be open within three years.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been a long haul, but I think it's going to be worth it,"
said Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow, also a member of OCTA's board
of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The station has been years in the planning. In the early 1990s,
Mission Viejo officials secured grant money for building the platform
but were unable to find a location.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in neighboring Laguna Niguel suggested a wedge of land
between Interstate 5 and the San Joaquin Hills toll road. But the
project was held up by funding problems and a dispute with the owner
of a company that occupied an acre of the desired land.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of Sepulveda Building and Supplies, John Connors, was
eventually paid $1.6 million by OCTA for his property.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson, who was mayor of Laguna Niguel when the
plan was developed, helped OCTA and Connors reach an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly have spent a lot of time on this project," said
Wilson. "It was important to me that we pulled some pressure off our
other stations and gave commuters another alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Parking at the Irvine station, eight miles up the tracks, has
become so limited that OCTA hired a valet service to squeeze dozens
of extra cars into 630 marked parking spots.</TE>
<TE>   Parking is also tight at the San Juan Capistrano depot, three
miles south.</TE>

<TE>   The addition of each new Metrolink station adds about three
minutes to a rider's commute. For Orange County residents who travel
the full length of the line--San Clemente to Los Angeles--the commute
will take one hour and 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With the added capacity at the Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo
station, Wilson is proposing incentives to attract riders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see something like a two-for-one plan for all new
Metrolink riders," Wilson said. "If indeed the gridlock is something
that continues to face people, then at least maybe they'll start
giving rail a try. Working on the way into the office and resting on
the way home is a more convenient and comfortable alternative."</TE>

<LD>   Health officials closed 2,000 feet of beach around Magnolia

<LD>Delhi Community Center will receive about $404,000 in state grants,
Gov. Gray Davis announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The money is part of a $12.8-million grant for 17 projects
statewide aimed at increasing child-care services for people in
employment training programs.</LD>

night.</LD>

as his Republican opponent, state Sen. Dick Monteith, in the race for
the 18th Congressional District seat held by Rep. Gary A. Condit.</LD>
<LD>   According to campaign finance reports, Cardoza (D-Merced) has
spent $461,000 on his campaign so far. Cardoza, who defeated Condit
in last month's primary election, raised nearly $503,000 from July 1
through March 31, almost double the $252,000 contributed to Monteith.</LD>
<LD>   Monteith (R-Modesto) ended the filing period with almost $107,000.</LD>

<HD>Fisheries Service Plan Is Rejected by Judge</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has ruled that the National Marine Fisheries Service
violated laws that require it to protect the Pacific ground fish and
failed to address the dumping of dead and dying fish at sea.</LD>
<LD>   The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Ocean Conservancy
sued the fisheries service last June, saying it wasn't doing enough
to find out how many ground fish are "bycatch," or fish that are
caught and discarded at sea because they aren't what fishermen are
seeking.</LD>
<LD>   The judge's ruling means the federal service and the Pacific
Fishery Management Council must rewrite the plan for management of
the fishery.</LD>

<HD>State Seeks Suspension of Doctor's License</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Colton physician accused of prescribing drugs over
Internet is the son of SLA slaying victim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge in San Diego was asked Tuesday to suspend the medical license
of a Colton doctor accused of prescribing drugs over the Internet and
ignoring an earlier order to stop doing so.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Jon Steven Opsahl is the son of Myrna Opsahl, who was slain by
Symbionese Liberation Army members during a 1975 bank robbery near
Sacramento. Earlier this year, five people, including accused SLA
member Sara Jane Olson, were charged in connection with the slaying.</LD>
<LD>   Opsahl, 41, of Riverside, is medical director of the OptiHealth
Wellness Center, a facility in Colton that specializes in treating
chemical dependency and weight problems.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Mary Agnes Matyszewski said Opsahl first came to
the attention of state investigators last fall when he wrote 15
Internet prescriptions for the drug Cipro for people who feared that
they had been exposed to anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   Matyszewski said Opsahl agreed in December to comply with a state
order to stop prescribing drugs over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   However, Matyszewski said California officials were contacted in
early March by the Wisconsin attorney general's office, which said a
woman there had overdosed on pain medications prescribed by Opsahl
after she found the doctor on the Internet. The woman lapsed into a
coma and, although she regained consciousness, she has not fully
recovered, Matyszewski said.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl took the stand Tuesday at his hearing before administrative
law judge Stephen Hjelt, admitting that although he talked to the
woman on the telephone, he never examined her in person, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Matyszewski said Hjelt commented that the telephone conversation
did not appear to constitute the "good-faith examination" required
under state law for the prescription of drugs. Hjelt took the matter
under submission.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Recall Nativo Lopez, Invisible Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chicago has Jesse Jackson. New York has Al Sharpton. Both started
with local minority-group constituencies and, by dint of passion,
personality and an eye for the TV camera, transformed themselves into
national media figures. Along the way, the two charismatic figures
also built cadres of loyal followers and staunch enemies.</LD>
<LD>   And Orange County has ... Nativo Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   If this were any metropolitan area other than Orange County, Lopez
would be a household name. Not to mention a household face. But
because this metropolis of nearly 3 million has no daily
multi-network TV news presence, its leaders go largely unnoticed.</LD>
<TE>   We can't really say, then, that like Jackson and Sharpton, the
50-year-old Lopez has an eye for the camera. There's no camera to
eye, so most residents probably haven't seen his handsome face and
slicked-back silver hair.</TE>
<TE>   Let's call him, then, the invisible lightning rod.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's tenure with the immigrant-rights group Hermandad Mexicana
Nacional has been dotted with controversy that has proved more smoke
than fire. His current tenure on the Santa Ana Board of Education now
includes, along with many tangible improvements for the district, a
recall movement against him.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Lopez has been in the forefront of various issues
connected to the emerging Mexican immigrant population in Orange
County and, more specifically, Santa Ana. He has threatened a Latino
boycott of the local tourism industry, challenged the Anaheim Police
Department's cooperation with U.S. immigration officials and accused
the Department of Motor Vehicles of racial profiling by targeting
Latinos in its crackdown on identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   The recall effort appears to be centered on Lopez's belief that
young Latino children shouldn't be forced too quickly into
English-language classes, for fear they'll fall behind during their
crucial early primary-school years.</TE>
<TE>   Just as with Jackson and Sharpton, reaction to Lopez has chipped
away at the stereotype of a monolithic minority group. That is, some
of Lopez's strongest critics, as evidenced by the recall movement,
come from the Latino community around which he's built his power
base.</TE>
<TE>   "He's fearless," says Enriqueta Ramos, a board member of the
Rancho Santiago Community College District. "He's not afraid to
confront government or institutions."</TE>
<TE>   Ramos doesn't claim Lopez as a friend and has butted heads with
him from time to time. But, she says, he's a community leader, in the
real meaning of the term.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's so much bigger than even his enemies like to give
him credit for," she says. "He's this humongous tree that is very
tall, and people see his roots swaying and think they may be able to
knock him down, but I think his roots are incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Asked where that strength comes, she replies, "From the thousands
of people he has helped."</TE>
<TE>   The "anti-Lopez" faction that has developed over the years tends
to sound the same notes as those who oppose people such as Jackson
and Sharpton. Loosely phrased, the rap is that Lopez has used
Hermandad to advance his own agenda and that he's a political
powerbroker who will bend the rules or try to intimidate opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a manipulator, so people think he has more support
than he has," one critic says. "There's kind of a mystique that he
has this power that I don't think he does."</TE>
<TE>   Not so, says Ramos, adding that Lopez's supporters have criticized
her in the past because she won't embrace all of his political
positions. "I don't see him as thinking of himself as a politician,
at all. Politicians will say one thing and do something else, but I
don't see him saying one thing and doing something else."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez has 2 1/2 more years on his school-board term. Ramos
pictures Lopez someday running for mayor Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Critics and all?</TE>
<TE>   "Someone once said," Ramos says, "if you don' t have any enemies,
you probably haven't done anything."</TE>

<HD>Murder Suspect Took Rifle, Witness Says</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder suspect Vincent Sanchez took an AK-47 assault rifle from his
roommate around the same time college student Megan Barroso was
gunned down as she drove home from a party last summer, a witness
testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Tim Lorenzen told a judge at
Sanchez's preliminary hearing on murder charges that the roommate
noticed the rifle and ammunition were missing about a week after the
July 5 shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez later admitted taking the firearm and returned it the next
day, Lorenzen testified. Authorities suspect the assault rifle was
used to shoot Barroso, a 20-year-old Moorpark College student, as she
drove home from a Fourth of July party.</LD>
<TE>   Her bullet-riddled car was found abandoned near a freeway overpass
early July 5, and her remains were found a month later in a canyon
near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Gene Torres, who arrived on the scene, found that the
rental car had three shots in the windshield, one in the driver-side
door and one through the hood.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Sanchez shot Barroso, pulled her from the car and
sexually assaulted her before she died. But defense attorneys say
there was no rape and that Barroso died almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, 31, a Simi Valley handyman, could face the death penalty
if prosecutors can prove that the killing occurred during a sexual
assault.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contend that their client shot Barroso, but they
are fighting the murder charge and other allegations in hopes of
keeping Sanchez off death row.</TE>

government today after shame over a disastrous 1995 peacekeeping mission
in the Balkans sank the ruling coalition a month before a general
election.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Wim Kok and his three-party coalition resigned Tuesday,
days after a damning official Dutch report said the politicians and
military brass should share some of the blame for failing to prevent
Europe's worst civilian slaughter since World War II: the 1995 massacre
in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica.</LD>
<LD>   With elections set for May 15, the resignation had little practical
effect. Kok, who was prime minister in July 1995 during the events in
Srebrenica, had said last year that he would not seek another term.</LD>
<TE>   Last week's report by the respected Netherlands Institute for War
Documentation confirmed that Dutch peacekeepers did little to prevent
Serbian forces from rounding up Muslims who had sought refuge in an area
of Bosnia-Herzegovina declared "safe" by the United Nations. More than
7,000 Muslims were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The institute concluded that political leaders had carried out an
"ill-conceived plan" intended to boost Dutch international prestige.
Unprepared troops were sent into a conflict to carry out a "mission
impossible" and defend about 30,000 refugees from Bosnian Serb forces in
the surrounding hills.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the 110 lightly armed Dutch peacekeepers became
unwitting collaborators in "ethnic cleansing" when the Serbian forces
overran the enclave.</TE>
<TE>   Kok told parliament that the time was overdue for a political price to
be paid.</TE>
<TE>   "The international community is anonymous and cannot take
responsibility in the name of the victims and survivors of Srebrenica. I
can and I do," he said. "I decided to offer my resignation, and the
entire Cabinet followed."</TE>

<HD>Nationwide Strike Hobbles Italy</HD>
<DH>Labor: Millions protest proposed reforms that would help employers
trim their work forces. Many planes and trains are idle.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Millions of Italians staged this country's first full-day work
stoppage in 20 years Tuesday to protest government plans to make it
easier to fire workers. Airports were almost deserted, few trains were
running, and banks, schools and post offices were closed.</LD>
<LD>   Italy's three biggest unions estimated that as many as 13 million
people had heeded the strike call, out of a total work force of 21
million. They said at least 2 million had taken part in rallies.</LD>
<LD>   Some independent observers said they thought the number of strikers
was closer to 6 million.</LD>
<TE>   Workers by the thousands gathered in piazzas up and down the country
for mostly festive demonstrations headed by union leaders and center-left
politicians and sprinkled with celebrities supporting the strike.</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, Oscar winner Roberto Benigni, of "Life Is Beautiful" fame,
brightened up a huge rally in the Piazza del Popolo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a grand demonstration," he said as the crowd roared its
approval. "Everything is beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   The strike did not bring Italy to a standstill, but it slowed it down
considerably. Hospitals were providing emergency services only, and many
factories were closed. Fiat Group said nearly half its workers took part,
while unions claimed the figure was 90%.</TE>
<TE>   About half the usual number of passenger trains were operating, said
state railway spokesman Carmine Amodeo.</TE>
<TE>   Many foreign airlines, including British Airways, Iberia and
Lufthansa, canceled flights. Alitalia, the national carrier, had
scratched more than two-thirds of its flights by midday, a spokeswoman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The strike, organized by the top three unions, was labor's response to
conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's vow to reform Italian
labor laws, some of the most restrictive in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Talks with unions that the government had hoped would avert the strike
broke down last month. Tensions were aggravated by the March 19 slaying
of one of the architects of labor reform, economist Marco Biagi. There
were suggestions from Berlusconi's circle that unions had fostered a
charged atmosphere that contributed to the crime. The leftist terrorist
group the Red Brigades claimed responsibility for the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The main impasse is over a reform that would eliminate rules requiring
employers to take back workers found to have been fired for "unjust
causes." Employers complain that those rules hamper their ability to get
rid of unneeded workers. Under the proposed reform, employers would have
to pay workers compensation but not take them back.</TE>
<TE>   The government insists that the reforms are necessary to make the
Italian economy more competitive and attract foreign investment.</TE>

<HD>Yemenis Take a Green Leaf as Serious Pastime</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Khat chewers say it's good for the economy and their
health. Critics decry addiction to the narcotic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ASNAF, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>It's hard to know if it was the years of isolation in a remote
village, or the years spent chewing on a narcotic leaf called khat, or
maybe a bit of both, but Aziz Mohammed Hasben wasn't fooling around when
he said the Earth must be flat.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe only what I see," said Hasben, 65, his words a bit garbled
by the pasty wad of green leaves tucked chipmunk-like into his cheek. "I
only know north, south, east and west. I don't believe the world is like
a ball."</LD>
<LD>   In Hasben's universe, some things have not changed since the days when
most people believed that the world was flat. His village in northern
Yemen has no running water, electricity or the other public
conveniences--such as sewers--generally associated with modern life. But,
as has been true for generations, it does have a supply of
khat--pronounced "gaht"--a shiny green leaf that grows on trees and
serves as the national pastime.</LD>
<TE>   And what better place to discuss the mysteries of the universe than a
daily khat chew, a midafternoon Yemeni ritual that, to the outsider,
looks like something between a kaffeeklatsch and a scene from a 1970s
Cheech and Chong movie spoofing marijuana use. There's a lot of casual
conversation, at times taken in bizarre directions by the mood-altering
nature of khat.</TE>
<TE>   But where Cheech and Chong got laughs, there is little amusing about
khat. This is a national habit of enormous proportions. Not only is khat
use legal, but nonusers are often treated as social outcasts. Soldiers
frequently walk around with a weapon in one hand and a bag of khat in the
other. Traffic police chew it while standing in the middle of the street.
If you want to meet with the speaker of parliament, Abdullah Hussein
Ahmar, better to catch up with him at his daily khat chew. (His leaves
are ground and served with a spoon.) Even President Ali Abdullah Saleh,
who has tried to cool his people's obsession, settles in for a good chew
now and then, his aides said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is actually a bad habit, chewing khat," said Mohammed Kahtan,
political director of Islah, the Islamic reform party, as he tucked a few
of the small, basil-shaped leaves into his mouth. "It is a bad habit, but
we surrender to it."</TE>
<TE>   Yemenis are defensive about khat. They insist that it is not addictive
and that its amphetamine-like effect is good for the economy, good for
one's health, good for maintaining strong ties with family and friends.
They say it energizes people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like liquor and chocolate," said Ahmed Ali Yemeni, 29, who is
well educated and fluent in English. "So many people benefit from it:
farms, sellers, transporters, the government. You are not forced to chew.
People are more productive with khat. They work harder, they get paid
more. It helps their income."</TE>
<TE>   This is the majority view in a country where officials acknowledge
that 70% to 90% of the 18 million people chew regularly, with many
children in the countryside starting as early as age 8.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-khat minority, however, sees it as a destructive addiction.</TE>
<TE>   For the individual, there are negative health effects that run the
gamut from indigestion and insomnia to manic behavior with grandiose
delusions, the latter a real problem in a country where just about every
man owns at least one firearm. Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Suprowicz, for
example, said the five armed men who kidnapped him in March 2000 were
chewing the leaf.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them were under the influence of khat, so they were agitated,"
said the ambassador, who was later released unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Khat is also damaging to the broader community.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a society spend 1 billion Yemeni rials [about $6 million] every
day on khat. We lose more than 18 million working hours a day chewing
khat," said Ahmed Jaber Afif, a former education minister who
unsuccessfully tried to get the government to crack down on khat use in
the 1970s. A decade ago, he founded an anti-khat organization that isn't
doing too well, either: He figures that it has 100 members.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say we are successful," Afif said. "But we will not lose
hope."</TE>
<TE>   Yemen is a poor country, among the least developed in the world. It
needs to attract investment, trade and hard currency. Though political
instability and violence have been among the main reasons for Yemen's
economic difficulties, khat also is a factor. The World Bank has cited
estimates that khat production accounts for 25% of the gross domestic
product.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a major contributor to the rural economy," said James Rawley, a
United Nations Development Program representative. "[But] the downsides,
there are quite a few. The amount of lost time in terms of the whole khat
phenomenon--it is a negative contributor to production throughout the
economy."</TE>
<TE>   For rich and poor, powerful and dispossessed, khat is the great
equalizer. About noon, many people begin to grind their teeth and think
about it. By 1 p.m. they are off to a market to pick up their stash. Khat
must be chewed within 48 hours of being picked, so Yemenis shop for it
the way the French shop for bread.</TE>
<TE>Men Haggle Over Green Bundles at Markets</TE>
<TE>   But there is none of the ambience of a Parisian bakery. Khat markets
are crowded with men haggling over bundles of branches and leaves. Even
in the most upscale markets, where tribal leaders buy the best-quality
leaves, merchants sell for the equivalent of about $12 a large bundle of
branches wrapped in cellophane, usually blue or pink. At a downscale
market, a chewer can buy a small bag filled with some leaves for less
than a dollar. It is estimated that many households spend as much as half
their annual income on khat, according to officials.</TE>
<TE>   Originating in Ethiopia, Catha edulis, or khat, is an evergreen plant
that can grow to 20 feet tall. Its leaves are chewed in Somalia, Kenya,
Malawi, Uganda, Tanzania, Congo, Zimbabwe and South Africa. In Yemen,
however, it is a way of life.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, khat was grown here between the famous coffee shrubs of
the southern Arabian Peninsula. Today it has largely displaced coffee and
other agricultural products, such as apples. Drive out of Sana, the
capital, and the rock-studded plain is barren but for small plots of slim
trees. Grape arbors are dried up. But the khat is protect by fences and
gunmen. In this parched land, officials say, as much as 80% of water goes
to khat farms.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder. It is a lucrative crop.</TE>
<TE>   Gannaf Iddris, 23, said his family pretty much abandoned growing
seasonal crops in favor of khat, which can be harvested throughout the
year. He can make about $175 a day selling khat, an enormous income in a
country with an estimated 35% unemployment. Pickers, usually children who
scurry up the flexible branches, can earn nearly $12 for two hours of
work, four times the amount earned harvesting apples.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were an alternative, we would do it," said Iddris, who farms
in an area outside Sana.</TE>
<TE>   Like grape growers, khat farmers talk about microclimates that affect
the quality and taste of their product. In this area, they produce four
types with different taste and effect. "Khat is better than wine," Iddris
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Khat, however, is quite different from wine. It contains a
psychoactive ingredient known as cathinone--chemically similar to
amphetamine--something that prompted the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration to declare khat a Schedule I narcotic, its most
restrictive category, making it illegal in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   To partake, the user plucks off the tender leaves and soft tips of
branches and chews them up, swallowing the juice and keeping the
masticated leaves tucked in the cheek. In theory, this is supposed to be
done in groups to promote socializing, but the country is full of
solitary chewers--like the soldier in uniform guarding the office of
Wahiba Farah, the minister of human rights, or the civil servant inside
who wipes the spit and green leaves from his cheek as he greets visitors.</TE>
<TE>Khat Chewing Part of Wedding Celebration</TE>
<TE>   In Asnaf, an ancient village of mud-brick houses north of the capital,
the community joined together recently to celebrate the wedding of 23
couples. In this traditional society, the women went off to another spot
to celebrate, leaving hundreds upon hundreds of men behind. The men
danced and ate--then got down to chewing. Many of the region's most
powerful sheiks and political leaders attended the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   The director of security for Sana, Col. Ahmed Maktashi, was sitting in
a corner, nibbling away at leaves, when Hasben leaned over and asked,
"What is behind America?" Those assembled thought that the question had
some political implication, until Hasben made it clear that he was
talking geography.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind America is Asia," Maktashi tried to explain politely. He
picked up a plastic bottle and tried to illustrate the shape of the
Earth, but Hasben would have none of it, shaking his head and waving his
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Haitham abu Haitham, 35, took a break from his khat and quipped:
"The end of the Earth, this is your village."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone laughed and went back to chewing.</TE>

<HD>In Israel, National Day Invites Introspection</HD>
<DH>Mideast: As it marks its 54th birthday, the Jewish state looks back
on its achievements and ponders its current crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel celebrates the 54th anniversary of its founding today. And
just as the nation was at war within hours of David Ben Gurion's
declaration of independence, so it is today. That reality has numbed and
frightened Israelis and left them to mark what should be a joyous
occasion with more soul-searching than celebration.</LD>
<LD>   Many towns have canceled all festivities because of security concerns.
In Jerusalem, thousands of soldiers are patrolling the streets amid plans
to go ahead with a fireworks display and outdoor singing and dancing in
some neighborhoods. But crowds will be sparse. Everyone knows that it's
not business as usual anymore. Terrorists could strike again. Staying
home is safer.</LD>
<LD>   Seldom have Israelis felt so vulnerable, been so full of questions or
found so few answers. What does the future hold? "I haven't a clue," a
merchant said.</LD>
<TE>   How could this be? Israelis ask. How could their nation--home of 37%
of the world's Jewry--be locked in another war after all this time? How
do you measure more than half a century of progress if your sons are
still dying in battle and you have to look over your shoulder, wondering
whether the person behind you wants to blow you up?</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good time for reflection," said Moshe Amirav, a former
right-wing Zionist who became a leading advocate of Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue. "And one of the questions you ask is: What was the whole idea
of coming to Israel in the first place? As I see it, it was to build a
secure home for Jews. But right now Israel is the most dangerous place in
the world for a Jew to be. So I guess you can say we failed.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got off the phone with my 13-year-old daughter, who's living
in Sweden with her mother. She said: 'Daddy, I don't want to come back to
Israel with all the shooting. You come here to visit instead.' And my son
in New York says he doesn't want to come back, either, for a few years
anyway. I tell them both, 'Yes, I can understand.' But this is very
painful for me to say.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we can't see a future or anything that will lift us up and
bring us to normalization," he said. "That's all we want--to be normal,
quiet, like the United States or countries in Europe. When you think like
that, it makes this a very sad Independence Day. You can't be happy with
our achievements, even though they have been many."</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, on the patio of a stone home on a narrow, hilly street,
Jeff Gafni was enjoying a late-morning cup of coffee. Gafni, a decorated
and wounded veteran of three wars, had his backpack and rifle by the
door. The next telephone call could bring an order to move out again.</TE>
<TE>   The British-born Gafni has lived in Israel for 53 of his 59 years. He
sees a cycle repeating itself when he looks at his 19-year-old son, now a
paratrooper.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a country with a lot of idealism," he said. "We always
believed peace was waiting. Maybe next week, maybe next month, but peace
was just around the corner. Now, for me 40 years later, we're in another
state of war. It looks like we moved backward.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean I think Israel is going to evaporate as a state or
enemies are going to take over. That won't happen. But I try to figure
out what went wrong and when things went wrong. I don't have answers, but
I doubt I'm going to see the dream fulfilled I had as a teenager, that I
would someday have a normal life where you don't spend your time and
energy in military thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning, for instance, I took my car to the mechanic and had to
get a bus home. I got a seat right behind the driver and I'm carefully
watching who gets on the bus, wondering if they look like a suicide
bomber. Now, that's not a normal thing to have to think about."</TE>
<TE>   Gafni, who never leaves the city without his rifle, has responded to
several suicide attacks as a volunteer policeman. At one demolished cafe
in October, he collected body parts of the victims--who, he learned two
days later, included his niece.</TE>
<TE>   Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948, according to Western
calendars. The event is celebrated here each year based on the Hebrew
calendar, and this year it falls on April 17.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll published by the Maariv newspaper this week, 52% of
respondents said calm with the Palestinians could be achieved only
through force. More than 60% said the current hostilities represented a
threat to the existence of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Other surveys have found widespread support for Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's ironfisted military campaign against Palestinians in the West
Bank, and Maariv found that 75% of those surveyed thought that Israel was
a "good" country to live in and that 83% would rather live in Israel than
any other country. More than half said Israel was going in the "right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   "We have good periods and bad periods, and this is a very bad period,"
said Cobi Schelf, who owns a downtown cafe, where business is down 50%.
At the door stands a young security guard with an Uzi pistol. His eyes
sweep the street, left to right, right to left, as though following a
tennis match, in his search for potential terrorists loaded with
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Schelf said he won't take his family on a country picnic this year, as
he has done on past independence days.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in the mood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He speaks of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat with
disgust and of the suicide bombing last month that killed 28 Jews at a
Passover meal in the coastal city of Netanya as something that could not
have been carried out by human beings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you this," he said. "That attack didn't just hit the
country. It hit God. He was watching."</TE>

<HD>Ruling in Belgium Could Help Sharon Avoid Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Justice: Prosecution on war crimes charges seems unlikely after
court rejects similar case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>

<DL>BRUSSELS
</DL>
<LD>A court here threw into doubt Tuesday a bid to try Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon in Belgium when it rejected a similar case
involving a former Congolese foreign minister accused of crimes against
humanity.</LD>
<LD>   The same appeals court is considering whether a Belgian court has the
right to try Sharon for alleged war crimes in connection with the 1982
massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut
during Israel's thrust into Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   "The legal proceedings were declared inadmissible," appeals court
spokesman Guy Delvoie said after a ruling that dismissed a case against
Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi on the grounds that he does not live in
Belgium.</LD>
<TE>   "No prosecution can be started against any defendant in absentia," the
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Ndombasi was accused of inciting hatred against ethnic Tutsis in
August 1998 in speeches referring to "vermin" and "extermination," four
years after massacres of ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in neighboring
Rwanda.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Verhaeghe, one of the lawyers representing the group of
Palestinians who brought the suit against Sharon, said he anticipated the
court's dismissal of a request to reopen an inquiry into the past of the
74-year-old Israeli leader for evidence of war crimes and genocide.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be very surprised if it's a different decision in our case,"
Verhaeghe said. "It's hard to imagine the court would set this condition
in April and a few months later decide something else."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's lawyer, Adrien Massert, welcomed the ruling, calling it an
"excellent decision."</TE>
<TE>   "The court backed our first argument that Belgium could only proceed
in such a case if the accused is arrested on Belgian soil," he said. "Our
arguments are sound."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon was Israel's defense minister at the time of the killings, and
his troops ringed the camps during the massacre by Lebanese Christian
militiamen. An internal Israeli investigation in 1983 found him
indirectly responsible.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling on the Sharon case is expected as early as June.</TE>
<TE>   Both cases were brought under a Belgian law that claims universal
jurisdiction in human rights cases regardless of where the alleged crimes
were committed.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Grants PLO Another Six-Month Waiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration said Tuesday that it would allow the
Palestine Liberation Organization to keep an office here for another six
months, but it warned that the PLO could be kicked out and have funding
cut if Yasser Arafat fails to crack down on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by President Bush came as Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell wrapped up his Middle East peacemaking mission. So far, Powell has
been unable to clinch agreements on a cease-fire or an Israeli troop
pullout from battle-scarred Palestinian cities.</LD>
<LD>   In a memorandum to Powell, Bush said it was "important to the national
security interests of the United States" to waive the provisions of a
1987 law that imposed restrictions on PLO activities.</LD>
<TE>   The six-month waivers have been routine since 1994, after the PLO and
Israel recognized each other. But Bush has come under increased pressure
from pro-Israeli groups in the United States to punish the PLO and
Arafat, its chairman, for a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in the
Jewish state.</TE>

<HD>Bush, Saudi Crown Prince to Meet in Texas</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Experts say talks next week are an important opportunity
for the two leaders to seek common ground on the Mideast conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a sign of his heightened involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, President Bush has scheduled a meeting at his Texas ranch next
week with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, one of the most important
behind-the-scenes leaders in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The White House said Tuesday that Abdullah, who had been reluctant to
meet with Bush, will visit with the president April 25 in what experts
outside the administration view as an important opportunity for the U.S.
and Saudi Arabia to seek common ground in trying to quell Middle East
violence.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah, as chief sponsor of a peace plan endorsed last month by the
Arab League, has elevated his political position in the region. Meeting
with him gives Bush an opportunity to demonstrate a readiness to listen
to the Arab view of the conflict.</LD>
<TE>   "Relations with the Saudis are strong," White House Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer said in announcing the meeting. "Obviously, events in the
Middle East lead to complications, and those complications are going to
be discussed."</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the president has been largely silent on the Middle
East troubles as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has traveled between
Arab nations, Israel and the West Bank. But Bush is likely to speak out
today on the Middle East, as well as on the war in Afghanistan, during a
speech at the Virginia Military Institute, White House officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Saudi relationship, complicated in the best of times by the
two countries' vastly different cultures, has taken on more of an
edge--and greater importance--in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks
and the Palestinian-Israeli fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, 15 were Saudis,
an embarrassment to the royal family.</TE>
<TE>   From the U.S. viewpoint, there have been other troubling developments,
such as an article in a Saudi newspaper asserting that Jews use the blood
of Christians and Muslims to make holiday foods. The paper's prominent
editor disavowed the story, printed last month while he was out of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   A government-run telethon ordered by King Fahd raised millions of
dollars last week--more than $100 million, by one report--to help the
families of Palestinian "martyrs," prompting accusations that the Saudis
were fueling violence against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, a poem by the Saudi ambassador to Britain, Ghazi
Algosaibi, that praised a female suicide bomber appeared in an
Arabic-language newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that the United States and the Arabs are out of touch,"
said Abdul Aziz Said, a professor of international relations at American
University in Washington and a specialist on conflict resolution.
Referring to the Bush-Abdullah meeting, he said, "Active engagement
becomes the antidote."</TE>
<TE>   Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, said the support voiced by some
Saudis for the Palestinian intifada does not diminish the depth of the
nearly seven-decade U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "The basics are still there. We have a very close, allied
relationship," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the meeting is taking place at Bush's ranch also
suggests a readiness on the part of both leaders to delve into the
current trouble, and to do so on a personal level.</TE>
<TE>   As president, Bush has met with only two other foreign leaders at his
ranch: Russian President Vladimir V. Putin in November and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair this month.</TE>
<TE>   Welcoming the crown prince to the 1,500-acre ranch in central Texas
"implies a degree of chumminess the Saudis might not have thought was
very acceptable in the [Middle East] region--to schmooze at the
ranch--because the Saudis are very formal," Kipper said.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia, with its oil riches, has long played a central financial
role in the Middle East. And in recent years, it has played a more active
political role.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah has become a leading figure in the Arab world, a man with
impeccable Islamic credentials and with a reputation for being a
straightforward diplomat. He runs the Saudi government on a day-to-day
basis in place of the ailing Fahd.</TE>
<TE>   Inserting himself earlier this year more prominently into
theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, he proposed that if Israel returned to
the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War, Arab states
would open normal diplomatic relations with Israel's government.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal won the endorsement of the Arab League at the group's
recent meeting, but its effect was undercut by the inclusion of a tirade
against Israel and rhetorical support for the Palestinian intifada.</TE>

<HD>Victims' Bill Gets Backing</HD>
<DH>Politics: Bush and Ashcroft give rights' advocates key support. 'It
is time . . . to balance the scales of justice,' the attorney general
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush called Tuesday for a constitutional amendment to
protect the rights of violent-crime victims, providing a key boost to
advocates who have struggled for years to give victims equal footing with
defendants in the courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Pushing a law-and-order message that has been a steady drumbeat of the
administration, Bush and Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft told supporters at a
Justice Department ceremony that the 8 million victims of violent crime
each year have too often had their rights ignored in the criminal justice
system. Establishing a bill of rights on their behalf, Bush said, "is one
of those rare instances when amending the Constitution is the right thing
to do."</LD>
<LD>   Key to the administration's endorsement, according to government
officials, was the assurance from Senate advocates that they would not
seek to use the issue to limit presidential pardons, unlike in a similar
effort that failed two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   It was Ashcroft--then a senator from Missouri--who pushed through an
amendment to the initiative in 2000 that would have forced the White
House to notify the victims when considering a grant of clemency and to
accept impact statements from the victims.</TE>
<TE>   But no such restrictions are included in the new bipartisan proposal
introduced Monday by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Jon Kyl
(R-Ariz.). In fact, the proposal specifically states that it does not
affect the president's authority to grant pardons.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a crime victims' amendment still faces the threat of
substantial opposition from politicians, particularly conservatives, who
believe that the rights of victims can be protected through standard laws
and that tinkering with the Constitution should only be considered as a
last resort. During the debate two years ago that led to the defeat of
the proposal, one senator chided supporters for "taking a roller to a
Rembrandt."</TE>
<TE>   Passing an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a
two-thirds vote of the Senate before it could go on to the House and the
states for ratification, is a notoriously difficult proposition. Congress
has considered more than 11,000 proposals to change the Constitution in
the last 213 years, with only 28 amendments accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who
opposed the initiative in 2000, is likely to schedule hearings on the
issue, but he has not indicated any change in his stance so far.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for victims rights were clearly heartened by Bush's strong
words of approval, and they said the White House endorsement--following
through on a pledge Bush made during his run for the White House in
2000--could tilt the balance in their favor. This is only the second time
Bush has backed a constitutional amendment, after his support last year
for a ban on flag-burning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about as good as it gets," a beaming Feinstein said after she
and other members of Congress, states' attorneys general and victims'
crime advocates attended the Bush-Ashcroft event.</TE>
<TE>   "America's Most Wanted" host John Walsh, who became perhaps the
country's leading champion of victims' rights after his 6-year-old son
was abducted and murdered in Florida in 1981, said afterward that the
support of the administration "is a milestone for victims' rights. . . .
Twenty years we've been working for this, and now we may finally get
there."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, President Clinton gave a general endorsement to the idea of a
victims' rights amendment, but both Feinstein and Walsh said Tuesday that
Clinton's support appeared somewhat halfhearted and that he never
followed up on it. However, they said they believe Bush will prove a true
advocate.</TE>
<TE>   The bill proposed by Feinstein and Kyl lays out seven procedural
rights for violent-crime victims, including the right to reasonable and
timely notice of court proceedings involving the crime; the right to
notification about the release of the accused; the right to address the
judge during court proceedings; and the right to have their safety
considered.</TE>
<TE>   "There were approximately 8 million victims of violent crime last
year," Ashcroft said, "but too often in the quest for justice, the rights
of these victims have been overlooked or ignored. It is time--it is past
time--to balance the scales of justice, to demand fairness and judicial
integrity not just for the accused but for the aggrieved as well."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has long sought to position itself as a
champion of crime victims, making unusual accommodations last year to
allow families of those killed in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing to watch
Timothy J. McVeigh's execution via satellite.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks gave the issue an even higher profile.
The Justice Department is again going to unusual lengths, this time to
play the cockpit voice recorder tape later this week for the families of
those killed in the Pennsylvania crash.</TE>
<TE>   Some families of Sept. 11 victims, however, have attacked the Justice
Department for the restrictions it originally placed on financial relief
to survivors, forcing changes in the formula after an emotional debate.
But Ashcroft said Tuesday that "this Justice Department is committed to
putting the interests of victims and their families first."</TE>
<TE>   As part of Tuesday's ceremony, Bush and Ashcroft gave out awards to
eight individuals and organizations who they said have been committed to
working for victims' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Among those honored was Sacramento chaplain Mindi Russell, who works
with volunteer chaplains at area police departments, schools and other
institutions to help victims.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven minutes after the Sept. 11 attacks, Russell was paged by
supervisors at the Red Cross and was flown in a military cargo plane to
New York City, where she spent two weeks working with families and
instructing 500 chaplains at the scene on mass disaster care.</TE>
<TE>   The message she imparted to the chaplains on the scene was "to comfort
and console, to do a lot more listening than talking," Russell recounted
after receiving her award.</TE>
<TE>   Especially in the first few days after the attacks, family members on
the scene "just wanted so badly to believe their loved ones were still
alive," she said. "We didn't want to give them false hope, but we wanted
to be there for them, to support them."</TE>

<HD>Black Studies Feud at Harvard Results in an Angry Exit</HD>
<DH>Education: Professor lashes out at university president as he
follows a colleague to Princeton.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>A bitter feud between Harvard and some members of its prestigious
department of African American studies continued Tuesday as departing
professor Cornel West lashed out at university President Lawrence Summers
as "the Ariel Sharon" of American education.</LD>
<LD>   West's decision to go to Princeton University, leaving a group of
scholars known as "the dream team" of black studies, followed the exit of
philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, who in January also headed for
Princeton. Department chairman Henry Louis Gates Jr. is mulling a similar
move.</LD>
<LD>   The tension began brewing last fall, when West and others in his
department questioned Summers' support of affirmative action at Harvard
and elsewhere. Summers in turn questioned the scholarship value of a rap
CD cut by West.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview this week in the New York Times, West also
characterized Summers as "very much as a bull in a china shop, and as a
bully, in a very delicate and dangerous situation."</TE>
<TE>   Harvard spokesman Joe Wrinn said Tuesday that he would not comment on
the remarks. West did not return calls to his office.</TE>
<TE>   West, who is one of only 17 Harvard faculty members to hold the
distinguished title of university professor, is recovering from prostate
cancer and has been on leave.</TE>
<TE>   West has said that he felt "dishonored" when Summers questioned the
scholarship value of his rap CD and when he objected to West's
involvement in an exploratory presidential bid launched by the Rev. Al
Sharpton, an activist in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The defections of West and Appiah were a blow both to Harvard and to
its black studies department. Appiah cited personal reasons for his
departure. But West, who taught religion at Princeton and led the African
American studies department there until 1994, blamed conflict with
Summers, a former Treasury secretary who last year became head of the
nation's oldest university.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement last week, Summers said: "All of us in the Harvard
community are grateful to Cornel West for his significant contributions
to Harvard's academic life, especially the great inspiration he provided
to so many students. We will miss him and I wish him every success at
Princeton."</TE>
<TE>   But West on Tuesday continued his criticism of the Harvard president,
saying that "Larry Summers strikes me as the Ariel Sharon of higher
education." Sharon, the hawkish Israeli prime minister, was blamed for
the massacre of Palestinians in Lebanon's Sabra and Shatilla refugee
camps two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   West also complained in the interview that Summers did not send a
get-well message until two months after his prostate cancer surgery.</TE>
<TE>   He has carried the feud into a forthcoming article in Vanity Fair.
West was incensed at accusations from Harvard officials that he missed
three weeks of class to pursue political activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss three weeks and sneak around and act like I'm there when I'm not
there?" West told the magazine. "That's the biggest attack on my
integrity, man."</TE>
<TE>   West won prominence with his 1993 book, "Race Matters." He also worked
on the Million Man March and national youth gang summits.</TE>

powerful floodlights outside the orbiting outpost.</LD>
<LD>   It was the fourth and final spacewalk for the visiting astronauts of
space shuttle Atlantis, who are due to leave today.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Ross, the veteran astronaut, and Lee Morin attached a 14-foot

<HD>Cloning Advocates, Foes Battle for Senators' Votes</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Both sides, desperate to pass a bill, are modifying their
positions to sway undecided lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With an upcoming Senate vote on the issue too close to call, both
sides in the dispute over the use of human cloning in disease research
are exploring ways to modify their competing bills to win support from
the 10 or so undecided lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The discussions show how the tight nature of the battle may wind up
changing the final shape of anti-cloning legislation. The issue is one of
the most emotional and politically volatile before Congress this year.</LD>
<LD>   Lobbyists who support cloning for medical research are talking up a
requirement that no cloning take place in or near fertility clinics. In
addition, they may propose that researchers be barred from preserving
cloned embryos in frozen storage, according to people familiar with the
discussions.</LD>
<TE>Reproductive Cloning Concerns Senators</TE>
<TE>   These rules would be aimed at answering critics, including President
Bush, who say that embryos created for research will inevitably be
misappropriated and placed into women as part of attempts to create
children.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations might make research cloning more palatable to some
senators, allowing them to argue that safeguards are in place to prevent
abuse, said one aide to an undecided lawmaker. Like others familiar with
legislative maneuvering, he did not want to be identified because of the
sensitive nature of the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Among opponents of cloning in medical research there is discussion of
dropping a provision from their bill that would impose hefty fines and
jail time on anyone who imported a medical treatment from another country
that had been created through cloning.</TE>
<TE>   No such treatments now exist. But some senators have said they are
wary of hindering patients from seeking cures for diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning involves using a cell from a person to create an embryo, which
has the same genetic makeup as the person who donated the cell.</TE>
<TE>   There is broad support in Congress for banning anyone from creating
embryos this way and then implanting them in women to produce children.</TE>
<TE>   But the Senate is divided on whether scientists should be able to
create embryos for research. Among other things, researchers want to
dissect the embryos for their stem cells, the cells that have drawn
intense interest for their potential to lead to cures for disease.</TE>
<TE>   The House of Representatives and Bush favor a ban on human cloning for
any purpose, and about 40 to 45 senators agree. An equal number of
senators are believed to support a measure that would ban cloning for
reproduction but preserve it as a tool of medical research.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute raises the possibility that no ban on cloning will become
law, and that the issue will become prominent in the fall campaigns for
control of the closely divided Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of a total ban say it is immoral to create human embryos
only to destroy them. They also say that a partial ban is unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   "Cloned human embryos created for research would be widely available
in laboratories and embryo farms," Bush asserted in a speech last week.
"Once cloned embryos were available, implantation would take place. Even
the tightest regulations and strict policing would not prevent or detect
the birth of cloned babies."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said cloning would create a "massive national market" for
the human eggs that the process requires, leading to the exploitation of
women.</TE>
<TE>   In discussions with undecided senators, advocates of cloning in
medical research have tentatively suggested several ways to address the
criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   Research teams might be required to offer psychological tests or other
screening to women who offer their eggs for cloning research.</TE>
<TE>   Other rules would seek to ensure that cloned embryos are kept away
from fertility clinics, where non-cloned embryos are routinely created
and transferred to women as part of high-tech methods for conceiving
children.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers could also be required to register with the Food and Drug
Administration before undertaking cloning. And the federal officials
might be required to report violations of the cloning rules to state
licensing officials, who could revoke the right to practice if the
violator is a doctor or other licensed professional.</TE>
<TE>Frist Opposes Importation Ban</TE>
<TE>   The proposed regulations have not been approved by Sens. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) or Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), lead sponsors of the
legislation that would bar cloning only for reproduction, people familiar
with events said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), sponsor of the measure that would ban all
human cloning, has not agreed to drop the provision that would bar the
importation of medical treatments derived from cloned embryos, said his
spokesman, Erik Hotmire.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill Kristol, a conservative activist and founder of an
anti-cloning group, said recently, "There's some unhappiness about the
importation ban, and there's been indications that Brownback might remove
that himself."</TE>
<TE>   The importation ban is opposed by Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), who
nonetheless supports Brownback's legislation. As the Senate's only
physician, Frist's opinions on health matters are closely watched by his
colleagues.</TE>

<LD>Hoping to defeat the man who unseated his father eight years ago,
Andrew Cuomo formally kicked off his campaign for governor.</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied by his mother, wife and three daughters, the former

Gov. George Pataki.</LD>
<LD>   "All you hear from George Pataki are excuses, and he blames people in
the past," Cuomo, 44, said outside the courthouse in Mineola, on Long
Island. "He has to blame people in the past because he can't defend the
present and he has no vision for the future."</LD>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Local officials should use "compassion and common sense" before
evicting a family from public housing because one member was caught with
drugs, the federal government's housing chief said.</LD>
<LD>   Housing Secretary Mel Martinez also urged local officials to view
taking away the often poor tenants' homes as a last resort in the effort
to purge public housing developments of drugs.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is the "one-strike" provision of a drug law that gives local
public housing authorities the option of evicting tenants if a guest or
family member uses, sells or possesses drugs, regardless of whether the
use was on housing property or if anyone else knew about it.</LD>

<HD>National Park Service Stalls Watercraft Ban</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The National Park Service on Tuesday reversed decisions by three
national parks to permanently ban personal watercraft from their
waterways.</LD>
<LD>   Those parks--Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and
Mississippi, Padre Island National Seashore in Texas and Cape Lookout
National Seashore in North Carolina--are among eight parks that will
temporarily prohibit access for personal watercraft (known by trade names
such as Jet Ski, Wave Runner and SeaDoo) beginning Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Personal watercraft are high-speed, gasoline-powered vessels, usually
less than 16 feet long.</LD>
<TE>   Permanent decisions about the use of personal watercraft in these
parks will hinge on assessments of their impact on wildlife and visitors
and on public comment.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Park Service announced it would comply with a
court order and permanently close five other parks Monday to personal
watercraft and other small boats. Whiskeytown National Recreation Area
north of Redding is in this category.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement highlights the mounting tension between
environmentalists and recreation groups over the use of national parks
and other treasured public lands. Environmentalists complain that the
noise and pollution from the machines spoil the natural surroundings and
erode the quality of the experience for many visitors. But recreation
enthusiasts argue that they too have a right to enjoy the public lands.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time that the Bush administration has faced
environmentalists' ire for its efforts to appease recreation groups.
Bowing to pressure from the snowmobile industry, the Interior Department
is reconsidering a permanent ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone National
Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Monday deadline for closing these areas to personal watercraft, at
least temporarily, was required by a federal court order as a settlement
of a lawsuit brought by Bluewater Network, a San Francisco-based
environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists criticized the National Park Service for leaving
open the door to roll back protections for Gulf Islands, Padre Island and
Cape Lookout.</TE>
<TE>   "These are places that were set aside to protect wildlife, and for
quiet, nonvehicular recreation," said Ron Tipton, vice president of the
National Parks Conservation Assn., an environmental group. "People go to
the national seashores because they see them as the most protected areas
of the country's coastline; they don't expect to be harassed by noisy"
personal watercraft.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasts also blasted the agency's announcement for banning
personal watercraft but not other kinds of power boats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair at all," said Mark Denny, managing director of the
American Watercraft Assn. "That's why we've gone to court to prevent it."</TE>
<TE>   "Much of this is based on personal bias against a hull design," Denny
said. "The same engines are used in nearly every outboard engine on the
water. There are many more types of boat that are louder."</TE>
<TE>   "We're stuck in the middle: Environmentalists want everything closed
and the watercraft industry wants everything open," Park Service
spokesman Gerry Gaumer said.</TE>
<TE>   The final decisions, he said, would be based on what the environmental
assessments show about the effect personal watercraft are having on
visitors' experiences, wildlife and other natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   The superintendents of Cape Lookout, Gulf Islands and Padre Island
national seashores had already made the determination that the watercraft
were harming their parks. In their assessments, they talked about noise,
air and water pollution, irresponsible use of the watercraft that
endangered other visitors and threats to wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Cape Lookout officials expressed concern about the harm
caused to aquatic vegetation and wildlife because these vessels have a
shallow draft that gives them the ability to penetrate areas that are not
open to other motorized watercraft.</TE>

<HD>To GOP, Arctic Oil Fight Worth the Energy</HD>
<DH>Congress: Republicans think their support for a drilling plan
unlikely to survive in the Senate will aid them in the long run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>From the moment President Bush made it central to his energy plan
last year, backers of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
and gas exploration knew they faced long odds in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   So why, with a vote looming in the Democratic-controlled chamber later
this week, are Republicans so persistent in pursuing what appears to be a
lost cause?</LD>
<LD>   Chalk it up to energy politics.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans are short of the 60 votes they need in the 100-member
Senate to overcome a promised Democratic-led filibuster. But GOP leaders
believe that if they can demonstrate majority support for the drilling
proposal by getting 50 or more votes, they will be better positioned to
include it in a final energy bill negotiated with the House.</TE>
<TE>   And even if they lose that battle, Republicans hope to lay the
groundwork to win the war, eventually.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the Republicans don't have the votes this time, they want to
build support for the future," said John J. Pitney Jr., a government
professor at Claremont McKenna College. He cited passage of the campaign
finance reform bill last month after years of defeats as an example of an
issue on which legislative persistence paid off.</TE>
<TE>'Who's in Charge . . . Does Matter'</TE>
<TE>   Drilling supporters say the issue could resonate in this fall's
campaign--especially if energy prices spike--and improve Republican
chances of retaking the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're close, I can go back home and say, 'If we had control of
this place, we'd be able to get this passed,' " said Sen. Rick Santorum
(R-Pa.). "It's a matter of showing that who's in charge [of the Senate]
does matter."</TE>
<TE>   As debate began Tuesday, drilling proponents scrambled for ways to
entice more senators to support the measure, offering to limit production
facilities to a 2,000-acre site in the 19-million-acre refuge while
setting aside 1.5 million acres as wilderness and prohibiting Alaska oil
exports except to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to limit "surface disturbance" to 2,000 acres was
assailed by the Sierra Club's executive director, Carl Pope, who argued
that if development were to occur it would result in a vast spider web of
industrial facilities, pipelines and roads.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-drilling forces also continued their efforts to attract the
support of senators from steel-producing states by touting their plan to
steer government revenue from the drilling to aid for the steel industry.</TE>
<TE>   And the drilling proponents staged a Capitol Hill rally with labor
groups who back the production plan because of the jobs it would create.
Democratic opposition to the proposal could cost the party support it
traditionally enjoys from such groups, Pitney said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Republican lobbying effort appeared to be gaining little
ground. One previously undecided senator, Blanche Lambert Lincoln
(D-Ark.), announced Tuesday she would oppose the drilling.</TE>
<TE>   And Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a leading drilling opponent,
sarcastically dismissed the latest GOP inducements for backing the
proposal. "The other side is so desperate to drill in the Arctic refuge,
their arguments change based on the headlines of the day. First they said
it was about gas prices, then it was about bringing peace to the Mideast.
Next thing we know, they'll say drilling will cut people's taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman added: "No matter what the argument, they simply don't have
the votes" to overcome the Democratic opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over drilling in the Alaska refuge is the main event in the
Senate's effort to write the first comprehensive energy bill in a decade.
Adhering to Bush's wishes, the GOP-controlled House last year passed a
bill that allows for the drilling. But it is not included in the Senate
measure, which stresses conservation over production and has been pending
on the floor for more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Drilling supporters say it would reduce U.S. dependence on foreign
oil. On the Senate floor Tuesday, they flashed photos of Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein, from whose country the United States imports oil, to
underscore the country's vulnerability to unstable Middle East supplies.
"We take his oil, put it in our airplanes and go bomb him," said Sen.
Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska).</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrating the deep emotions sparked by the issue, Alaska's other
senator, Republican Ted Stevens, repeatedly assailed "radical"
environmentalists for misrepresenting the tundra as a pristine place.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hell in the wintertime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, led by environmental groups, contend the drilling would
produce far less oil and fewer jobs than proponents claim, while
endangering one of the nation's most precious and unspoiled wildlife
habitats.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans can try all they want to disguise what they're doing, but
there's no doubt among scientists . . . that drilling would forever
damage one of our last national treasures," said Sen. John F. Kerry
(D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate understands what's happening here and understands that we
don't want to create another Prudhoe Bay of filthy air for a few drops of
oil that do nothing to wean us from foreign oil when we have within our
power legitimate, sustainable ways of meeting our energy needs."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Americans understand the difference between false promises of
ANWR drilling and the real promise of energy security, and it's the
Republicans who ought to be on the defensive on this question."</TE>
<TE>Key Procedural Vote Is Expected Thursday</TE>
<TE>   Kerry is the leader of the filibuster threat against the GOP bid to
include the Alaska drilling provision in the Senate's energy bill. The
key procedural vote on choking off a filibuster--which requires 60
votes--is expected Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Some moderate Republicans have joined a majority of Democrats in
opposing the drilling, while a handful of Democrats from energy-producing
states support it.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said that, based on his
latest head count, Republicans "will be lucky to get 50 votes, much less
60," on the procedural vote.</TE>
<TE>   A Senate Democratic leadership aide also expressed skepticism about
GOP hopes that the drilling proposal will be part of a House-Senate
compromise bill.</TE>
<TE>   Said the aide, who requested anonymity: "What [Republicans] are hoping
for is that they can get it in the conference report, it comes back to
the Senate and enough of our guys say, 'I'm not willing to filibuster the
whole energy bill over this issue.' I think they're wrong."</TE>

<TE>What's at Stake</TE>
<TE>   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been protected since 1960. In
1980, Congress earmarked 1.5 million acres on its coastal plain for
potential drilling.</TE>
<TE>Oil</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Geological Survey estimate: Six billion to 16 billion barrels can
be recovered, though opponents argue that only about 3.2 billion barrels
are economically recoverable. Production: About 1 million barrels a day
are produced from oil fields west of ANWR. Some estimate that there is
enough oil in ANWR to supply the U.S. for about six months.</TE>
<TE>Wildlife</TE>
<TE>   Caribou: Drilling could disrupt the 123,000-member Porcupine herd,
which migrates 400 miles to ANWR's coastal plain to calve.</TE>
<TE>   Other mammals: Musk oxen, grizzly and polar bears, wolves, moose.</TE>
<TE>   Migratory birds: Millions of ducks, geese, jaegers, gulls and terns.</TE>
<TE>Economy</TE>
<TE>   New jobs:  Bush administration officials say oil drilling in ANWR
would create 735,000 new jobs nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   What Democrats say: The job-creation estimate is based on a decade-old

<HD>More Hospitals Can Use Angioplasty, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: The procedure could be safely done in small facilities
without cardiac surgery programs because complications are rare, survey
shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Community hospitals can safely perform balloon angioplasties to
unclog blocked arteries, and the procedure is as big a lifesaver in such
facilities as in major medical centers, according to a new study.</LD>
<LD>   Angioplasty involves threading a catheter through an artery in the
groin to the artery feeding the heart, then expanding a balloon to
compress the clot or other blockage. It reduces the death rate from heart
attacks by about 40% compared with the administration of clot-busting
enzymes.</LD>
<LD>   But currently, an estimated 70% of heart attack victims in the United
States are taken to local hospitals that cannot perform angioplasties.
Medical guidelines restrict the procedure to hospitals that have cardiac
surgery units to deal with possible complications.</LD>
<TE>   But the new study, reported in today's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Assn., demonstrates that such complications are
extremely rare. The benefits of angioplasty far outweigh any risks, the
study shows.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Aversano of Johns Hopkins Hospital and his colleagues
concluded that 20 lives will be saved for every 1,000 patients who
undergo angioplasty rather than receiving clot-busting drugs, also called
thrombolytics. The incidence of nonfatal second heart attacks and
bleeding in the brain, which affect about 1% of patients receiving the
drugs, was also sharply reduced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's becoming less tenable for us as a society to accept two
standards of care" for heart attacks: angioplasties for patients who go
to major medical centers and drugs for those who do not, Aversano said.
"It is incumbent on us to adjust our health-care policy so that the
greatest number of patients with heart attacks have access to the better
form of therapy."</TE>
<TE>   In an editorial in the same journal, Dr. Christopher P. Cannon of
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston wrote that, while having more
hospitals perform angioplasty is clearly beneficial, it is not the only
solution.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to change our emergency treatment and transport patients to a
cardiac center" for angioplasty rather than simply send patients to the
nearest hospital, he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Boston, he added, is implementing a program that will ensure heart
attack victims are taken to a center where they can receive the
lifesaving procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Patients have options as well, said Dr. Alex Durairaj of County-USC
Hospital. If they think they are having a heart attack, they can insist
that the responding ambulance take them to a major medical center where
angioplasty is routinely performed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the patient's option where to go, ultimately," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Angioplasty was first performed in 1979. At the time, "it was
unthinkable to do it in a hospital that did not have a cardiac surgery
program because, if there were complications, it was necessary to crack
the chest open and take care of it right away," Durairaj said.</TE>
<TE>   The technology has improved so much since then and the complication
rate is so low that the requirement for a cardiac surgery program "is
probably overkill," he added, but the guidelines have never changed.
Patients who once were required to stay in the hospital for nearly a week
after elective angioplasty now go home the next day, or sometimes even
the same day.</TE>
<TE>   To test the safety and efficacy, Aversano and his colleagues organized
a trial in 11 community hospitals in Massachusetts and Maryland. All of
the hospitals already had a cardiac surgeon on call who was certified to
perform angioplasties, but those specialists performed their elective
procedures at larger medical centers.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital staffs received three months of training in the care of
patients who underwent the procedure. Each hospital also received a
waiver from local governing bodies to perform angioplasty even though
they did not have a cardiac surgery program.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitals ultimately enrolled 451 heart attack victims who were
randomly assigned to receive either thrombolytics or angioplasty.</TE>
<TE>   At six weeks after their heart attacks, 10.7% of those receiving
angioplasty had died, suffered a second heart attack or had a stroke,
compared with 17.7% of those receiving thrombolytics. At six months, the
comparable figures were 12.4% and 19.9%.</TE>
<TE>   No complications requiring surgery occurred in any of the angioplasty
patients. Nearly three-quarters of those receiving thrombolytics
eventually had to have angioplasty as well because they had blockages in
their arteries that were not improved by the destruction of a clot.</TE>
<TE>   The study has some limitations. The most important was the relatively
small sample size. Aversano had initially planned to enroll 2,550
patients, but the Hopkins group was unable to obtain the $6 million that
would have been necessary to complete the study.</TE>
<TE>   The American Heart Assn. and the American College of Cardiology are
unlikely to alter their guidelines for angioplasty any time soon, said
Dr. Ishmael Muno of USC University Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Those groups, he said, "believe that the best chance a patient has is
to put them in a situation where . . . should they get in trouble, they
can be referred to a surgeon for repair, a bypass" or other corrective
measures.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of performing angioplasty in a hospital that doesn't
have such an option, he concluded, will be an "ongoing controversy."</TE>

<HD>Customs to Help Speed Shipments</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT
</DL>
<LD>Federal officials unveiled a program Tuesday that is intended to
speed up U.S. customs inspections of planes, trucks and ships carrying
imports without sacrificing security.</LD>
<LD>   "We will enhance security," said Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge,
standing beneath the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest crossing on the
U.S.-Canada border. "We will facilitate commerce. And in the end, we'll
be a safer and a stronger country because of it."</LD>
<LD>   To participate, a company must enforce security on its own supplier
network and supply data to the Customs Service. It also must conduct
stiffer employee background checks. In exchange, the company will enjoy
fast-track treatment at the nation's border crossings.</LD>
<TE>   Sixty companies have joined the program so far, including General
Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, BP America, Motorola, Sara Lee and Target.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership should result in quicker border crossings than before
Sept. 11, said Kevin Smith, GM's director of customs administration.</TE>
<TE>   GM gets about 600 truckloads of goods shipped from Canada daily. Under
the new program, Smith said, the auto maker will give the government
advance information on the goods and the suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 minutes before a shipment arrives at the border, GM will
electronically notify customs that a truck is approaching the border and
exactly what is on it.</TE>

<HD>'Virtual' Porn: Born of Digital Wizardry</HD>
<DH>Technology: Images generated by computer are fast becoming nearly
identical to real people in photos and films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's an image that seems weirdly incongruous: a computer-created
picture of the head of wholesome, underage Britney Spears electronically
pasted onto the body of an adult engaged in an explicit sexual act.</LD>
<LD>   Fake? Of course, but the picture, and countless others patched
together using similar techniques, have become a staple of online kiddie
porn.</LD>
<LD>   Between the clearly fake world of pornographic cartoons and the
clearly real realm of actual children engaged in lurid sexual acts sits
the amorphous field of "virtual child pornography."</LD>
<TE>   Advances in computer technology have allowed photo enthusiasts,
artists and movie makers to create images that are nearly
indistinguishable from reality.</TE>
<TE>   Pedophiles have embraced the same technology. Using easily available
programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, pedophiles have poured out a flood of
fake erotic photographs, in which one person's head, often a young
celebrity's, is electronically pasted onto another person's body.</TE>
<TE>   They can use the same tools to modify hard-core photographs of adults
to make them seem younger than they actually are. And tapping into
animation tools similar to those used by Hollywood's visual effects
community, it is possible to create explicit sex scenes with children
without using real children.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say that the vast majority of child
pornography is real, not virtual. Yet they realize that, because of the
increasing power of computers, that equation could be turned around soon.</TE>
<TE>Battle Brewing Over Morality, Technology</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Tuesday was the first salvo in this
futuristic battle over morality and technology. The court ruled that
truly virtual kiddie porn, no matter how realistic it appears, is
protected by the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the court is saying that it is not child pornography if
there's no real child involved," said attorney H. Louis Sirkin, who
represents the Free Speech Coalition, a collection of adult-film makers
that challenged the federal statute before the Supreme Court. "Our
position has always been simply that you can't prove that a person
engaged in an activity is under age 18 if the person doesn't even exist."</TE>
<TE>   This fight is, in essence, a product of the Internet revolution, which
created a global marketplace for child pornography and spread the
popularity of powerful digital tools to modify images.</TE>
<TE>   The spark for the current debate is a 1992 case in which a Texan,
Terry Kimbrough, pulled digital files off a Danish bulletin-board system.
He was later indicted for "receiving" child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Arthur Schwartz, argued that the government could not
prove that the images had been made using actual children.</TE>
<TE>   To prove that point, Schwartz put on the stand a graphic artist, who
showed how even someone with basic computer knowledge could use a
software program such as Photoshop to alter a photograph.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kimbrough was ultimately convicted, the case alarmed
politicians and law enforcement officials, who were concerned about the
possibility of wholesale use of the digital defense.</TE>
<TE>The Images Are Easily Downloaded</TE>
<TE>   The case coincided with the Internet boom, when personal computer
sales were soaring and the technical boundaries of what people could
artistically create at home were blurring.</TE>
<TE>   Apple Computer Co., maker of the colorful iMac, ran advertisements
showing children making their own animated movies and exchanging photos
with friends.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the most widespread use of these tools among pornographers is
the practice of stitching together bodies, heads and sex acts into lurid
combinations. The Spears photograph is merely one of a torrent of images
easily downloaded from popular Internet venues, such as Yahoo's online
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court did not rule on this digital technique, as neither
side contested that such "morphed" images were illegal because some part
of a real child was involved.</TE>
<TE>   Of greater concern, though, was the issue of creating a virtual child.
Though possible to do, the technology remains limited, even for the most
powerful computers and filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood studios have explored the limits of computer animation and
imaging technology. Sony, Pixar, Industrial Light &amp; Magic and others have
produced digital actors with key roles in feature films.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nearly all were nonhuman creatures, such as the mouse in "Stuart
Little" and Jar Jar Binks, the Gungan sidekick from "Star Wars, Episode
I: The Phantom Menace."</TE>
<TE>   The reason was simply that creating digital human actors is
exponentially more difficult. While they have been used in crowds and as
virtual stunt doubles, few have played a role requiring an extreme
close-up because it wouldn't stand up to scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Even the team behind the computer-generated 2001 film "Final Fantasy:
The Spirits Within" couldn't make its characters look authentic,
regardless of the film's estimated $150-million production bill.</TE>
<TE>   Truly "virtual" child pornography, created from scratch, is rare
because it is too difficult for the average person to create, say law
enforcement officials and sources at the Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the court's ruling, few expect the technology to stop
evolving.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who has seen, for example, the film 'Final Fantasy: The
Spirits Within' can understand the government's concern," wrote Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor in her dissenting opinion.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stem cell transplants, first developed to treat blood cancers, may
halt the progression of multiple sclerosis, researchers reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Most scientists believe multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder.
A victim's immune system attacks nerve fibers in the brain and spinal
cord, destroying an insulating layer called myelin.</LD>
<LD>   People with the disease suffer pain, have difficulty controlling their
muscles and experience cognitive problems.</LD>
<TE>   But a study from the University of Washington Medical Center in
Seattle suggests that obliterating a person's immune cells and then
growing a new set by using the patient's own stem cells might prevent the
disease from getting worse.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. George Kraft, director of the university's Multiple Sclerosis
Research and Training Center, presented results of the study Tuesday at
the American Academy of Neurology meeting in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have known since the 1950s that suppressing the immune
system reduces the progression of MS. But "if that were the end of
things, the patient would die" because the absence of a working immune
system would leave the way open to deadly infections, Kraft said. The
technique has "always been in the back of our minds, but you couldn't get
up to a therapeutic level because of the toxicity."</TE>
<TE>   To avoid that problem, the researchers use stem cells. Nearly all
cells in the body have a specific function--blood cells cannot become
muscle cells, nerve cells cannot become skin cells and so on. By
contrast, the cells of an embryo are unspecialized: They can develop into
many different types of tissue. Stem cells, which in adults are mostly
found in bone marrow, retain that flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   In the research, doctors gave the patients an injection of growth
factor to send stem cells from the bone marrow to the bloodstream. The
doctors then harvested the stem cells by drawing the patient's blood and
filtering it, keeping the stem cells and discarding immune cells that
might perpetuate the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to prevent the reintroduction of the disease," said
Richard Nash, a transplant physician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle. He helped develop the procedure used in the
research.</TE>
<TE>   Once the stem cells were harvested, researchers used radiation,
chemotherapy and antibodies to wipe out the patient's immune system.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the stem cells were reintroduced to the patient's
bloodstream, where they turned into new immune system cells. The level of
immune cells recovers within nine days, Nash said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers, working with transplant physicians in different
centers, followed 26 patients for an average of 15 months after the
procedure, called autologous stem cell transplantation. In more than 75%
of the patients, their disability stopped getting worse after the
treatment, Kraft said.</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, no guarantee that the immune cells won't begin
attacking nerve fibers again in the future, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are not sure what triggers the immune response that causes
MS, said Dr. Michael Racke, associate professor of immunology and
neurology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic and environmental factors likely contribute. If one person in
a set of identical twins gets MS, for example, the other, who has the
same genetic material, has only a 25% chance of developing the disease,
he explained. That is a much higher rate than a person in the general
population but still not a sure thing.</TE>
<TE>   The hope with stem cell transplants is that "I then become my own
twin," with a reduced chance of getting MS again, Racke said.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure has risks. Some patients--about 5% to 10% in these
studies--have died of infection due to immune system suppression.</TE>
<TE>   Kraft limited his study to patients severely affected by MS who had
not responded to other available treatments. Patients in earlier stages
of the disease, who might be progressing more rapidly, will be included
in future studies. A National Institutes of Health study, for example,
will compare transplants with Novantrone, an FDA-approved drug to prevent
relapses, said Richard Burt, director of immunotherapy at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks' speech to the City
Council on Tuesday:</LD>
<LD>   You as council members and the [Police] Commission in the future will
have to determine how many lives should be lost to accommodate a police
union as payback for its endorsement of the mayor and to accommodate a
small number of community activists who want the Police Department to be
at their beck and call. The true question is how much emphasis is placed
on the value of life over political agendas.</LD>
<LD>   [Regarding discipline] In my opinion, the department has turned around
roughly 50 years of institutional neglect within a very short time.</LD>
<TE>   When you consider my meeting with the mayor in January in which he
said that he had already secured the votes for both commission
non-reappointment and for the appeal to this council, when you take into
account [Police Commission President Rick] Caruso's specific statements
in front of 40 to 50 LAPD personnel, in which he admitted that he was a
puppet for the mayor, and when you consider the transfer of city funds to
the union to fight against my reappointment . . . it is apparent that
this entire process was flawed for political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   We can now see behind the scenes that there was never an intent for
this to be merit-based. We can also see that the campaign against me and
this department has been orchestrated by the Police Protective League in
concert with the mayor's office.</TE>

<HD>Parks Suggests Police Union Used City Money in Effort to Oust Him</HD>
<DH>Payments: Officials of Protective League, which received funds to
defend officers, call chief's claim 'a dishonest statement.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' combative speech to the City
Council covered the familiar terrain of his reappointment effort--crime
rates, morale, community policing and discipline. But the chief leveled
one new blockbuster claim, suggesting that the the police union used $3.5
million in city money to wage a campaign against his reappointment.</LD>
<LD>   The Police Protective League received the money during the last year
from the city as part of a contract negotiated between the union and
Police Department in July 2000 to compensate the league for taking over
the representation of officers at internal disciplinary police hearings.</LD>
<LD>   Under the contract, the union will get $6.5 million over 18 months to
assist it as it assumes the job of representing officers accused of
misconduct, a task that in the past was handled and paid for by the
Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   The city already has begun making those payments, even though the
union has been slow to assume the task of defending the officers, lending
weight to the chief's questions about how the money is being used. At the
same time, the league did set out to raise more than $1 million this year
to run an advertising campaign against the chief.</TE>
<TE>   But officials on various sides of the issue and documents relating to
it reveal no evidence of a direct link between the payments the union
received from the city and the money it used to pay for a television
advertising campaign, which the league pulled after one day at the urging
of Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   During his hourlong speech Tuesday, Parks suggested that the money may
have been used in the union's political campaign because the city began
paying the league before the union started defending officers.</TE>
<TE>   "One can only wonder why the Police Protective League was given this
largess by the city for doing nothing?" he said in his speech. "Was it to
give them a war chest to go after me?"</TE>
<TE>   Union officials Tuesday denied that any city money for the defense
representation of officers had been used in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a dishonest statement," said Hank Hernandez, general counsel
for the league. "We have not spent money allocated to legal defense of
officers on this campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The union, which was supposed to begin representing officers accused
of misconduct last May, did not take up the job until October, league
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a plan in place to step in and represent officers," said
Hernandez. "But it was the department management who kept assigning
defense reps."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan countered that the department continued doing
the job because the union hadn't stepped up to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers need a defense, are entitled to a defense," said
Brennan, who added that he believes the league still has not fully taken
over the task. "Whether or not the league was ready for the
responsibility, we didn't want to leave the officers in the lurch."</TE>
<TE>   According to City Administrative Officer William Fujioka, who
negotiated the contract for the city, a dispute about the terms of the
contract stalled the transfer of defense representation from the LAPD to
the union.</TE>
<TE>   The union felt that it should only have to represent officers at Board
of Rights hearings, the most serious level of a discipline hearing.
League officials said that providing counsel to officers at other
hearings would cost too much money.</TE>
<TE>   The city eventually concurred, and struck an agreement in October
limiting the level of representation that the union has to handle.</TE>
<TE>   As the matter was debated, the union continued to receive portions of
the $6.5-million contract, based on a payment schedule agreed upon by the
league and the city almost two years before the debate over Parks'
reappointment flared.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea what they've done with the money," Parks said at a
news conference after his speech. "We just brought it up as a very
interesting coincidence."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said that the union has used $800,000 of the city funds to
hire attorneys to represent officers, and that the rest of the money will
be used similarly.</TE>

<HD>Siblings Killed and Buried Texas Boy, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: A 10-year-old and 15-year-old are accused of stabbing and
suffocating their brother, 6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LEWISVILLE, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Authorities found the body of a 6-year-old boy buried in a creek
bed behind his suburban Dallas home Tuesday and said his 10-year-old
brother and 15-year-old sister had confessed to killing him.</LD>
<LD>   Police say the girl led them to the shallow grave of Jackson Carr
about six hours after he was reported missing Monday evening.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson's brother told their parents the boy disappeared after a game
of hide-and-seek, sparking a search by police and neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson was stabbed in the neck and suffocated, the coroner said in
ruling the death a homicide. The grave in heavily wooded terrain is about
100 yards from the family's home.</TE>
<TE>   The siblings were being held at a Denton County detention center on
suspicion of murder, police investigator Eddie Barrett said. Formal
charges were not immediately filed.</TE>
<TE>   "The information we have is, of course, not a complete picture,"
prosecutor Lee Ann Breading told the Dallas Morning News in a story
posted on its Web site. "Lewisville is still finalizing their case."</TE>
<TE>   The girl "confessed to killing her brother" and the 10-year-old
admitted he held his brother down "during the process of murder," Sgt.
Richard Douglas said.</TE>
<TE>   Police would not comment on a possible motive but said evidence was
found in the home. The parents, Michael and Rita Carr, are not suspects,
Douglas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents are traumatized by this," he said. "They've been
cooperative."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Mike Houser, who helped authorities search for the boy, said
he hadn't noticed the freshly turned dirt.</TE>
<TE>   "When everybody was searching, we weren't looking for a grave. We were
looking for a little boy," Houser said. "I thought he was just lost."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the family has lived in the rural subdivision 20 miles
northwest of Dallas for about four months and that the children regularly
played in the creek bed. A red tent the children used as a fort was still
standing near the loose red dirt where the body was buried. Homicide
investigators' plastic gloves were discarded on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Janet Ellison said she had seen the brothers riding their
bicycles shortly before Jackson was reported missing.</TE>
<TE>   "They were riding their bikes, like everything was normal," she said.
"It's devastating."</TE>
<TE>   At the Lewisville school where Jackson was in the first grade,
counselors were called in to help students.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to concentrate more on the school and helping the
children that are still here to deal with this tragedy," said Margaret
Gurecky, a school spokeswoman. She said teachers are equally upset.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very bright, energetic and lively young man, a precious
child they certainly will miss and was well-loved by his classmates,"
Gurecky said.</TE>
<TE>   Even police were shocked, Douglas said. "This is a very hard case
because you have children hurting children," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Children age 10 and older typically face juvenile crime charges, and
punishment is determined by a juvenile judge.</TE>
<TE>   Children as young as 13 can be certified to stand trial as an adult,
depending on the circumstances of the crime.</TE>

<HD>Ads Aim to Sway Senators on Yucca Dump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Opponents of radioactive storage at Nevada's Yucca Mountain aired
their first television commercial Tuesday, warning Vermont audiences
about the dangers of shipping spent nuclear fuel rods cross-country to
the volcanic ridge 90 miles northwest of here.</LD>
<LD>   The ad will run several hundred times in Burlington, Vt., at a cost of
about $300,000, said Mark Brown, a media consultant employed by Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-second spot shows a truck as it would carry nuclear waste from
a reactor to Nevada. Menacing music can be heard.</LD>
<TE>   "With over 50,000 nuclear trucks and trainloads moving through our
streets, even the government admits nuclear accidents are inevitable,"
the announcer says. "And terrorist attacks will become harder than ever
to prevent. Only the Senate can stop this now. Call your senators today."</TE>
<TE>   The ad is endorsed by the Vermont chapters of the Sierra Club, the
U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Physicians for Social
Responsibility--among the nation's most politically active grass-roots
lobbying groups--and was financed by the state of Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists said the ad made its debut in Vermont--a relatively
inexpensive launching ground for the TV campaign--because of its history
of environmental activism and because its senators are believed to be
open-minded on the issue, despite their stated positions.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the ad, Sen. James M. Jeffords, an independent, issued
a written statement Tuesday: "The alternative to Yucca Mountain would be
to store spent nuclear fuel in dry casks on the banks of the Connecticut
River, which I believe poses serious and unacceptable environmental and
safety risks."</TE>
<TE>   Vermont's other senator, Democrat Patrick J. Leahy, said through a
spokesman that he favors Yucca Mountain but has questions about the
safety of transporting radioactive fuel rods across the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has said it is safer to ship 77,000 tons of
spent fuel rods to Yucca than to keep it stored at more than 100
facilities in 37 states. Critics say the nuclear waste would be
vulnerable to accident or terrorism if shipped and that, in any case,
there will always be some fuel rods stored alongside reactors.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn rejected President Bush's selection
of Yucca Mountain to store the radioactive waste, and now the Senate and
House must vote to keep the project alive.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is expected to vote in July, and about 65 senators are
believed to favor use of Yucca Mountain. Lobbying is underway to change
the minds of 15 of them. A House vote backing Yucca Mountain is likely.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Yucca Mountain hope the ad will agitate viewers to ask
their senators to oppose the $60-billion project. Brown said the ad
campaign will air next in Missouri, Utah and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   So far, about $6.7 million has been set aside to fund the campaign,
including $1.5 million that Clark County commissioners in Las Vegas
authorized Tuesday. The county previously allocated $1 million, and
Nevada state legislators set aside $4 million. The balance of the fund
came from other counties.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Yucca activists hope their campaign coffers will grow by an
additional $6 million because Nevada lawmakers pledged last week to match
private donations dollar-for-dollar with $3 million of additional state
money.</TE>
<TE>   In the week since Guinn asked Nevadans to contribute $1 each to help
keep Yucca nuclear-free, more than $77,000 has been raised, including a
$75,000 donation from Dorothy Lemelson, widow of an inventor of consumer
electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, several hundred environmental activists rallied on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol, pledging to mount a grass-roots campaign to
oppose the project.</TE>
<TE>   "If we license Yucca Mountain, every day can be Sept. 11 because that
is the kind of threat we're exposing our nation, our communities, our
families to," said Sierra Club President Carl Pope.</TE>
<TE>   At an earlier news conference, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) voiced his
support of the project. "After decades of confirming scientific research
and billions of dollars spent, it's time for the federal government to
fulfill its obligation to safely store the nation's used nuclear fuel."</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Police found one man dead, and another man and two women injured
after a confrontation apparently involving a crossbow at a house on
Tuesday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Police responded to a call from the house about 2:20 p.m., said
Sgt. Steve Dixon.</LD>
<LD>   Two severely beaten women came out of the house when police
arrived. They were taken to a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Police found a man inside the house who had serious slash wounds
to his wrists and forearms. Police took him to Santa Clara Medical
Center, where he was being treated and detained for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   They believe the man is a suspect in the death of the other man,
who was found in the backyard patio area of the home.</TE>
<TE>   "The shooting does not appear to have been from a firearm but more
of a crossbow or some type of weapon of that sort," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   The four people may have been roommates, Dixon said. The death and
injuries are under investigation.</TE>

<HD>Cal Grant Recipient Total to Fall Short of Goals</HD>
<DH>College: The number of scholarships will rise, but
thousands of students will be denied money. Millions in unspent aid
may be returned to the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state again this year will award fewer Cal Grant scholarships to
needy college students than expected, raising the possibility that
millions of dollars in unspent aid will be returned to state coffers.</LD>
<LD>   Although the number of grants guaranteed to qualified high school
seniors will rise from 48,000 last year to an estimated 60,000 this
year, it still falls short of the program's goals, according to a
legislative analysis and preliminary figures released Tuesday by the
California Student Aid Commission.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, thousands of older students who competed for
grants will be denied funding, as many were last year.</LD>
<TE>   The figures were discussed Tuesday at a hearing called by
Assemblywoman Elaine White Alquist (D-Santa Clara), who chairs the
Assembly's higher education committee.</TE>
<TE>   Alquist said Tuesday that she continues to be concerned about the
program falling short of its goals. She said she was especially
troubled about its denial of aid again this year to thousands of
qualified recipients.</TE>
<TE>   "The state of California has not made a real commitment yet to
providing a college education to qualified students who wish to have
it," Alquist said during a break in the hearing. "We're hoping for
better things next year."</TE>
<TE>   Touted by many admirers as the nation's leading state-funded
scholarship program, the Cal Grant program was expanded in 1999 to
create a guarantee of financial aid for every California high school
graduate who has at least a C average and can demonstrate financial
need.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to these "entitlement" grants, a smaller pool of
competitive grants was set aside for students who have been out of
high school longer than 18 months. These grants are awarded on the
basis of several factors, including grade-point average and family
income.</TE>
<TE>   But administrative problems, from communication glitches to overly
complex forms, have plagued the expanded scholarship program, and
last year it was forced to return $35 million in unused money to the
state's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Alquist said millions more in unused funds might have to be
returned to the state this year.</TE>
<TE>   Carole Solov, a spokeswoman for the aid commission, acknowledged
the expanded program's troubles but said the latest grant figures
showed progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just very pleased with these preliminary numbers," she
said. "We're not finished yet, and we're already nearly 10% over last
year. We've got nowhere to go but up."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the commission has awarded 53,000 guaranteed grants to
high school seniors for 2002-03, Solov said. Another 24,000
applications were incomplete or contained errors and can be
corrected. The commission estimates that as many as 7,000 of these
will eventually be accepted, pushing the total awards to about
60,000, she said.</TE>
<TE>   About 22,500 competitive awards will be given this year to older
students, she said, with about half of them determined now and a
second round in the fall. These awards are extraordinarily
competitive, she acknowledged, with about 71,000 students vying for
11,250 slots.</TE>
<TE>   The mismatch in demand for the guaranteed and competitive grants
concerns some legislators and commission officials. A bill to
transfer the extra money from one pool to the other died in committee
last year, but legislators are planning to try again.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Kerry Mazzoni, state secretary for education, said she
too was satisfied with the latest numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very, very pleased to see an increase in the numbers,"
Mazzoni said. "We're also hoping and expecting that they get better
over time."</TE>

<HD>Priest Convicted in 1981 Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Catholic clergyman faces up to five years in
prison for molesting a teenage girl in Northern California. He is
acquitted of raping another girl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA ROSA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>After sorting through allegations dating back two decades, a Sonoma
County jury Tuesday convicted a Roman Catholic priest of molesting a
teenage girl in 1981 but acquitted him of raping another girl four
years earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Father Donald Wren Kimball, a former youth minister known for
using rock 'n' roll music to relay his religious message, will be
sentenced May 15 on one felony count of committing a lewd act upon a
child, and another of doing so forcibly.</LD>
<LD>   Kimball, 58, could be imprisoned for up to five years. He was
taken into custody after the verdicts were read. The priest, who was
born and raised in Santa Rosa, had denied all charges but did not
testify during the trial.</LD>
<TE>   Observers in the packed courtroom gasped when the jury of nine men
and three women read the first verdict, finding Kimball not guilty of
rape. But when the guilty verdicts were announced, several elderly
women thrust their fists into the air.</TE>
<TE>   The victims said afterward they were not dismayed by the verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not disappointed," said Mary Agbayani, who alleged that
Kimball raped her on the altar at Resurrection Church and then drove
her to get an abortion in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Now 38 and the mother of nine children, she said, "Many doors have
been opened for cases of other children abused by priests. They'll be
coming forward in the next five to 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   The molestation victim, Ellen Brem, said of the verdicts: "This is
for the victims of the clergy everywhere. I hope it wakes the
Catholic Church up."</TE>
<TE>   The convictions come at a time when the church is under scrutiny
for allowing abusive priests to operate in its midst.</TE>
<TE>   In the Santa Rosa diocese, Kimball is one of about a dozen priests
who have been accused of sexual misconduct since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese has spent $7.4 million to settle various cases,
including $1.6 million involving claims against Kimball.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball, an inactive priest since the late 1980s, remained
impassive as the verdicts were read after three days of jury
deliberation. Dressed in khaki-colored pants, a blue blazer and an
open-collared purple shirt, he stared straight at Sonoma County
Superior Court Judge Gayle Guynup.</TE>
<TE>   Tears in her eyes, Agbayani's mother, Maureen Holden, called out:
"Put the cuffs on him now."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. But
defense attorney Chris Andrian said they told lawyers they had
focused solely on the evidence and had not been influenced by the
national priest scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't here to send messages," he said. "They decided the
case on the evidence. They said they took no delight in their work."</TE>
<TE>   The jury returned to the courtroom at 11:20 a.m. and told the
judge they had reached a verdict. But Guynup sent them back to
continue deliberations when she found that they had not reached a
decision on the third of three charges.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours later, jurors sent a note to the judge asking for a
clarification on whether touching someone over the clothes
constituted substantial sexual conduct. The jury finally returned at
4:40 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Gary Medvigy said he was not disappointed that he did
not get the rape conviction, saying that the jury had to rule on the
allegations based on the definition of rape when the alleged crime
occurred in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "The laws were not as strict then," he said. "A charge of rape
required resistance on the part of the victim."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged rape victim told reporters she does not expect an
apology from Kimball, as she once said she sought. "We won't get any
'I'm sorrys' from Don Kimball, but knowing that he'll go to prison is
great," she said. "Thinking that he'll have to register as a sex
offender for the rest of his life is empowering to me."</TE>
<TE>   She criticized the Catholic Diocese of Santa Rosa for its handling
of the case. "This case is a crack in the dam. There's no way the
Catholic Church can fix it. They're going to have to change."</TE>
<TE>   The diocese has been embarrassed by revelations that reached their
highest level two years ago when a bishop, G. Patrick Ziemann,
resigned after being accused of coercing another priest into having
sex with him.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, the diocese settled a civil suit with several
Resurrection Church parishioners who said they were molested by
Kimball.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the $1.6-million settlement, $500,000 was set aside to
start a victims fund as well as a committee to review continuing
allegations of clergy misconduct in the 140,000-member diocese, which
runs from Santa Rosa to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Resurrection Church said that other claims of abuse by
priests have been made to the committee in recent months and that
they are calling on church officials to make them public.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was delayed briefly last week when Kimball allegedly
lashed out at a newspaper photographer during a court recess,
knocking her camera to the floor. He was arrested and released on
$30,000 bail. Kimball has denied striking her.</TE>
<TE>   MaryClare Lawrence, an attorney who sued the church on behalf of
three ex-parishioners allegedly molested by Kimball, said the
priest's response to the courtroom incident was typical of his
reaction to his other crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Don Kimball says, 'I only touched the camera. It wasn't my
fault.' It's just like he tells this community, 'I only touched those
children. But it wasn't my fault.'"</TE>
<TE>   David Shaw, the current pastor at Resurrection Church, said the
parish has been harmed by the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we've lost some people who felt this kind of behavior was
the last straw," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One grandfather, whose daughter was allegedly molested by Kimball
in the 1970s, has been attending a victims' support group at
Resurrection Church.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy today," he said. "For Don Kimball to spend just two
hours in prison is enough for us. For him to get the stamp of a
marked man is all the justice we need."</TE>

<HD>3 Companies Liable in Tahoe MTBE Pollution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury has found three companies responsible for poisoning South Lake
Tahoe's drinking water supply with a possible carcinogen found in
gasoline--and found that two of the firms knew the chemical's dangers
for years but failed to warn water officials.</LD>
<LD>   Shell Oil, Lyondell Chemical Co. and Tosco Corp. are responsible
for pollution that shut down more than a third of South Lake Tahoe's
34 drinking wells, the San Francisco Superior Court jury said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The jury also found that Shell and Lyondell withheld information
about the dangers of MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) and that the
gasoline additive is a defective product. Deliberations on damages
are tentatively scheduled to begin April 22.</LD>
<TE>   South Tahoe Public Utility District officials and spokespeople for
Lyondell and Tosco declined to comment Tuesday. Attempts to reach
Shell officials were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big decision. For the first time, MTBE in gasoline is
considered a product defect. It's going to have ramifications across
the country," said Will Rospov, an attorney with San Francisco-based
Communities for a Better Environment. "It shows that the oil
companies are finally going to be held accountable for MTBE
contamination."</TE>
<TE>   MTBE was first added to gasoline more than two decades ago to make
it burn cleaner, and its use became widespread in the 1990s. Later
research revealed that it spreads quickly through the soil and
groundwater and may cause cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Officials struggling with MTBE contamination elsewhere praised the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It should reverberate in the executive suites and board rooms of
oil companies and cause them to realize they have embarked on a legal
strategy that will bring them nothing but grief," said Joe Lawrence,
Santa Monica's assistant city attorney. The city has sued seven major
oil companies and 11 other firms for allegedly tainting much of its
drinking water with MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup costs could reach $200 million, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The case is expected to go to trial
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence said several dozen similar cases have been filed across
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup nationwide is expected to cost at least $29 billion,
according to a study commissioned by Santa Monica and several other
cities. California is phasing out use of the chemical by Jan. 1,
2004.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, prosecutors have sued several oil companies,
seeking civil penalties from Atlantic Richfield Co., BP Amoco Corp.,
Thrifty Oil Co., Shell Oil Co., ARCO Chemical Co. and Lyondell
Chemical Co. The suits allege that the firms are responsible for
contaminating ground water under 330 gas stations in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The South Lake Tahoe decision "doesn't carry any precedential
value legally," said Michelle Lyman, a deputy district attorney. "As
a practical matter, it should send a message to the defendants that
at least one set of jurors believes that they failed to disclose what
they knew about MTBE."</TE>

<HD>2 State Officials Blast Panel's Decision on San Diego
Sewage</HD>
<DH>Environment: They say Coastal Commission overstepped its
authority in rejecting the city's bid for waiver extension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Two officials of the Davis administration Tuesday blasted as "without
any legal basis" the decision of the state Coastal Commission last
week to oppose the city's bid for an extension of a waiver from the
federal Clean Water Act.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy and other city officials have said the
Coastal Commission's action, if not overturned, could force the city
to spend billions of dollars installing needless upgrades to the
treatment plants that pump partially treated sewage into the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   In a strongly worded letter, California Resources Secretary Mary
Nichols and Environmental Protection Secretary Winston Hickox told
commission members that their action was "clearly beyond the scope of
the commission's authority and without any legal basis."</LD>
<TE>   The two suggested that San Diego be allowed to resubmit its
application immediately so that the commission can reconsider its
action. The commission's next meeting is in San Diego next month.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Chairwoman Sara Wan of Malibu said she had not read the
letter and could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Shirley Dettloff, a strong opponent of the San Diego
application, said she did not believe the commission had done
anything wrong and that rejecting the San Diego waiver application
was a step toward "ensuring clean water, which I thought was supposed
to be our No. 1 priority."</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we made a very responsible decision," said Dettloff, a
member of the Huntington Beach City Council. "We're only asking for
secondary [treatment of sewage], which most districts already have."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in San Diego, where the Clean Water Act waiver has been
an issue for two decades, were exultant at the Nichols-Hickox letter.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to serve on the Coastal Commission," said Councilman Byron
Wear, "so I can safely say that this group seems to be out of touch
with reality at times."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy--with legal, political and environmental
aspects--could foreshadow an even more contentious debate next year,
when the Orange County Sanitation District is also expected to
request an extension of its Clean Water Act waiver.</TE>
<TE>   With seven of its 12 members in attendance, the commission voted 6
to 1 at last week's meeting in Santa Barbara to reject San Diego's
request to back its bid for another five-year waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Fortified with studies from the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, San Diego asserts that it deserves a waiver extension
because sewage from its plants is not harming fish and other aquatic
life.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Water Act requires that sewage treatment operators send
sewage through a secondary treatment. But it contains a provision for
a waiver if a city can prove that its sewage is not harming the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reviewing the same data
provided to the Coastal Commission, has tentatively approved San
Diego for a waiver extension. The Coastal Commission staff also
recommended approval.</TE>
<TE>   By law, the commission can determine whether the city's waiver
application is consistent with the Coastal Commission Act.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting the San Diego application, the commission suggested
it would reconsider if the city agreed to increase monitoring of the
effects of its sewage outflow, reduce the amount of solid waste and
make greater use of reclaimed water.</TE>
<TE>   But Nichols and Hickox said the commission has no authority to set
conditions on waiver applications.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's action was roundly criticized by two Democratic
lawmakers from San Diego, Rep. Bob Filner and Assemblyman Juan
Vargas, both of whom have worked on the city's behalf to secure a
waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, the Regional Water Quality Control Board endorsed
the waiver application.</TE>

<HD>Simon Sees Davis as 'Big Brother'</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP hopeful says the governor's demand that he
release his tax returns is unreasonable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. compared Gov. Gray
Davis on Tuesday to Karl Marx and "Big Brother" for demanding that
the GOP challenger release his tax returns to prove he paid his fair
share of taxes.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't even know what a fair share is," Simon said. "I mean,
that sounds like somebody coming out of Moscow, you know? Their fair
share. You know, Karl Marx talked like that."</LD>
<LD>   Simon, a multimillionaire, said he had filed for an extension with
the Internal Revenue Service. He said that with his "fairly complex
financial holdings," he "could not be reasonably expected" to file
his income tax returns by April 15.</LD>
<TE>   The Democratic incumbent released his tax returns Monday and
demanded that Simon do the same. Davis told reporters: "Part of
running for governor is making available your tax return so people
can see you're paying your fair share."</TE>
<TE>   But on a San Francisco radio talk show Tuesday night, Simon
rejected the governor's demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I think that people are deserving of a certain amount of
privacy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of income tax returns has become routine for candidates
for high public office, but is not required by law. Davis released
his tax returns Monday. They showed that he and his wife, Sharon
Davis, had $200,352 in income last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The mere fact that he discloses his tax returns doesn't mean that
I've got to disclose mine," Simon said on KSFO radio's "Brian Wilson
Show."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who appointed Gray Davis the commissioner of the
IRS," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon went on to invoke George Orwell's book "1984."</TE>
<TE>   The governor's "mind-set is one of big government, and Big Brother
is watching," he said. "Big Brother will let you know if you've been
behaving yourself. Quite frankly, Brian, I don't need Big Brother to
tell me if I've been behaving myself."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar responded: "What is he hiding?</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to go around criticizing the governor on the
California state budget, I think Californians have a right to know
whether he's paid into it," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   On another matter, Simon sought to clarify his stand on offshore
oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   "I am against offshore drilling off California with respect to new
contracts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When a caller asked Simon about existing contracts, he responded,
"No new rigs."</TE>
<TE>   But the Davis campaign, which has tried to cast Simon as a threat
to the environment, still questioned whether Simon would support the
state's litigation against the Bush administration to maintain state
control over existing oil-field leases.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is saying he is standing with California against the
federal government's effort to quash our review of oil leases, that's
one thing," Salazar said. "But I'm just not sure I heard that."</TE>

<HD>Senate Panel OKs Trigger-Lock Bill</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Public Safety Committee approves a ban on gun
safety devices not approved by the attorney general.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Senate Public Safety Committee approved a bill Tuesday that would
ban the sale of any firearm safety device not approved by Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer.</LD>
<LD>   The bill (SB 1670) by Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena) is intended to
rid gun store shelves of an array of plastic trigger locks and other
devices that fail to comply with recently adopted safety standards
set by the state Department of Justice.</LD>
<LD>   Since Jan. 1, guns sold or transferred by a dealer must be fitted
with a safety mechanism approved by the department. So far, 81 have
been approved, many supplied as standard equipment by the
manufacturers.</LD>
<TE>   But Scott, a leading gun-control advocate whose adult son was
killed in an accidental shooting, said the market is full of trigger
locks that do not work but that are sold to unsuspecting customers
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, trigger locks are sold off the shelf that are
little more than worthless," Scott testified. Some break easily, he
said, and others fail to prevent an accidental firing when the gun is
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   The bill cleared the Public Safety Committee on a bipartisan 6-0
vote and was sent to the Appropriations Committee for another
hearing. It is supported by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun
Violence, Million Mom March, Women Against Gun Violence and other
gun-control organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The only witness to testify against the bill was a Sacramento-area
gun store employee named Ken Greenwood. He said some safety devices
that are not state-approved are still "functional to provide safety
in someone's home."</TE>
<TE>   "To outlaw existing trigger locks that are out there on the market
doesn't make a lot of sense," Greenwood said.</TE>

<HD>Priest Sues Woman Over Sex Accusations</HD>
<DH>Courts: Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird of the Orange diocese
follows through with demand that Lori Haigh retract charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top priest with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange filed a
slander suit Friday against a San Francisco woman who alleged he made
sexual advances.</LD>
<LD>   Diocesan officials said Tuesday they had been notified of the
lawsuit but were not a part of it.</LD>
<LD>   Lori Haigh, 37, made her comments about Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird
this month after being paid $1.2 million by the Orange and Los
Angeles dioceses to settle molestation allegations against Father
John Lenihan.</LD>
<TE>   She accused Lenihan of impregnating her at 16 and paying for her
abortion.</TE>
<TE>   She accused Baird, now a monsignor and spokesman for the diocese,
of rubbing himself against her and kissing her on the lips in an
office at Holy Family Cathedral in Orange 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   She also alleged that Baird never told his superiors of the
accusations against Lenihan, an accusation she leveled against
another high-ranking priest, Msgr. John Urell.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the April 1 settlement, Baird held a news conference
at diocesan headquarters to deny that he had ever met Haigh or had
any sexual allegation leveled against him in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I state unequivocally that I have no awareness of ever having met
or spoken with this person in my life and have absolutely no idea who
Miss Haigh is," Baird said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 100% memory that I have never made any inappropriate
contact with any person during my 33 years as a priest."</TE>
<TE>   He added that if she didn't immediately retract her statement, he
would file suit.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Robert C. Baker, said Baird would drop his lawsuit
if Haigh recanted.</TE>
<TE>   "If she retracts, it's over," said Baker, a Los Angeles attorney
who represented O.J. Simpson in his civil trial. "If not, it's time
to let a jury decide."</TE>
<TE>   The slander suit is another twist in the Catholic priest sex
scandal that has gripped the nation over the last four months.
Hundreds of victims have come forward to make accusations against
priests--both in court and privately to church officials--but Baird
has taken he rare step of fighting in court.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after Baird's news conference, Haigh passed a
lie-detector test in an attempt to prove her allegations. In
addition, another woman complained to the diocese that Baird had made
sexual advances toward her.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said lie-detector results are easily manipulated, and
inadmissible in court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's worthless," said Baker, adding Baird wouldn't be taking a
polygraph test for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said she wasn't surprised by the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand he's got his reputation and career to protect," she
said. "I've got peace of mind knowing what I said happened, really
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Baird has one of the highest profiles of any priest in the Orange
diocese. He is its chief spokesman, pastor of a popular Balboa Island
parish and a key liaison between the local business community and the
church.</TE>
<TE>   His parishioners at St. John Vianney Chapel are currently holding
a rosary prayer service in his support for nine consecutive days.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh's attorney, Katherine K. Freberg, said she sent a letter to
the two dioceses after hearing Baird's April 1 comments and reading
about e-mail exchanges indicating that the Los Angeles archdiocese
might have identified an unnamed priest accused of molestation by
Haigh in the lawsuit, though they kept the information from Freberg.</TE>
<TE>   In it, Freberg said Haigh demanded an additional $950,000 in
damages, wanted admissions from Baird and Urell that she was telling
the truth, and apologies from Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown and
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   She said the Orange diocese has rejected the claim, but she hadn't
heard from the archdiocese.</TE>

<HD>Murder Suspect Took Assault Rifle, Witness Tells Judge</HD>
<DH>Crime: An officer testifies that Vincent Sanchez's roommate
noticed the weapon was missing a week after a Moorpark student was
slain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder suspect Vincent Sanchez took an AK-47 assault rifle from his
roommate around the same time college student Megan Barroso was
gunned down as she drove home from a party last summer, a witness
testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Tim Lorenzen told a judge at
Sanchez's preliminary hearing on murder charges that the roommate
noticed the rifle and ammunition were missing about a week after the
July 5 shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez later admitted taking the firearm and returned it the next
day, Lorenzen testified. Authorities suspect the assault rifle was
used to shoot Barroso, a 20-year-old Moorpark College student, as she
drove home from a Fourth of July party.</LD>
<TE>   Her bullet-riddled car was found abandoned near a freeway overpass
early July 5, and her remains were found a month later in a canyon
near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Gene Torres, who arrived on the scene, found that the
rental car had three shots in the windshield, one in the driver-side
door and one through the hood.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Sanchez shot Barroso, pulled her from the car and
sexually assaulted her before she died. But defense attorneys say
there was no rape and that Barroso died almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, 31, a Simi Valley handyman, could face the death penalty
if prosecutors can prove that the killing occurred during a sexual
assault.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contend that their client shot Barroso, but they
are fighting the murder charge and other allegations in hopes of
keeping Sanchez off death row.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has pleaded guilty to raping and assaulting at least 10
women in Simi Valley during the last five years, and for the last
week the preliminary hearing in Ventura County Superior Court has
largely focused on the circumstances of those crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But the evidence shifted to the Barroso slaying Tuesday as
Lorenzen and other witnesses testified to the discovery of Barroso's
car and later her body.</TE>
<TE>   A crime scene technician found bullet fragments and six cartridge
casings in the nearby area, as well as a cleaning rod to an assault
rifle, according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   In the car, authorities found blood near the gear shift and a
blood-stained cosmetics bag.</TE>

<HD>Parks Says Hahn, Union Colluded</HD>
<DH>LAPD: In urging City Council to give him a second term,
chief blames politics for the increase in crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A determined Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks used his
appeal to the City Council on Tuesday to denounce Mayor James K. Hahn
and the city's police union, whom Parks accused of conspiring to make
life better for police officers at the expense of public safety.</LD>
<LD>   The chief's extraordinary address was covered live by local
television stations and made before a packed council chamber, with
hundreds of his supporters listening quietly as he excoriated the
very political leadership whose support he was courting. At one
point, Parks suggested that political motives had cost lives.</LD>
<LD>   "You as council members and the commission in the future will have
to determine how many lives should be lost to accommodate a police
union as payback for its endorsement of the mayor and to accommodate
a small number of community activists who want the Police Department
at their beck and call," he said. "The true question is how much
emphasis is placed on the value of life over political agendas."</LD>
<TE>   Parks has been a Los Angeles police officer for 37 years, and he
appeared for Tuesday's hearing in the dark blue uniform of the
LAPD--his adorned with the four stars on the collar that only the
chief is allowed to wear. Somber and deliberate, he read for more
than an hour. He addressed the council members individually by name
as they sat a few feet away.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor did not attend the session, and afterward his staff
refused to make him available for comment. Hahn had no public events
Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "Mayor Hahn was disappointed that Chief Parks chose to use his
time before the council to engage in personal attacks instead of
laying out a vision for the next five years at the LAPD," said Julie
Wong, a spokeswoman for the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Others who came in for criticism from Parks were quicker to
respond. Rick Caruso, president of the Police Commission that denied
Parks his reappointment, defended the panel's decision and its
process.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, who heads the police union, called the chief's
remarks "absurd" and said the union was not as powerful as Parks
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   In the council chambers, the chief suggested sinister motives by
his opponents, principally Hahn and the union. He concluded his
statement by acknowledging that the odds were against his
reappointment, but he urged the council to give him a chance.</TE>
<TE>   The council is expected to vote today on whether to overturn the
commission's 4-1 decision. To date, only three of the council's 15
members--Nate Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Jan Perry--have
expressed strong support for the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Though members of the council said they were impressed by some of
the things Parks said, several questioned whether he would be able to
secure the 10 votes needed to override the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "His speech was really, really impressive," said Councilwoman
Cindy Miscikowski, who heads the council's Public Safety Committee.
"There may have been some minds changed, but I just don't know. I
just don't think there are enough votes to overturn it."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is still an extraordinarily uphill battle for the
chief in council," he said, adding that he would reserve voicing his
opinion until the council discussed the matter in today's session.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate how negative and personal this debate has
become, for all sides and for the sake of the city," Weiss said. "I
think that it's important to remember that no one in public
office--an elected official or an appointed official--has a right to
a public job.... We need to keep this in mind as we evaluate what has
occurred here."</TE>
<TE>   Parks' address blended his defense of his record with his curt
rejection of the decision to deny him a second term. Throughout, he
alluded to political machinations that he said prevented him from
receiving a fair hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, he argued that it was unfair to judge him on
the city's increase in crime over the last two years. He noted that
crime had declined in his first two years as chief, and he blamed the
recent increases on politics and politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Parks said the drive to alter the Police
Department's work schedule, to adopt a federal consent decree
governing LAPD reform and to take officers out of patrol duties and
put them into community policing assignments caused crime to
increase. Then-Mayor Richard Riordan, who appointed Parks, agreed to
the consent decree and pushed Parks to beef up popular community
policing programs. Hahn, who succeeded Riordan, also supported those
moves and pressed for the revised work schedule as well.</TE>
<TE>   All three efforts enjoyed strong council support.</TE>
<TE>   "We were directed to move forward swiftly and implement all three
of these changes," Parks said. "Then, as arrests went down, crime
went up and [those] who were responsible for these decisions refused
to take responsibility. They have disingenuously turned to me, as
chief of police, and asked, 'Why is crime going up?'"</TE>
<TE>   Parks added: "You cannot take police resources off the street in
this volume and expect it will not have a negative impact on crime."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that when the senior lead officer program was reinstated
in 2000, 168 officers were removed from patrol duties. Meanwhile, as
many as 300 officers were removed from patrol to work on reforms
outlined in a federal consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Parks said, officer deployment is down about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "In each instance, the department voice was ignored," he said. "We
were directed to move forward swiftly and implement all three of
these changes."</TE>
<TE>   Parks was even more pointedly critical of the process by which
Hahn had opposed him. He told council members that he first informed
the mayor in January that he would be seeking a second term. At that
time, Parks says, the mayor urged him to retire and told him that he
had already secured three votes on the five-member commission to oust
him. A spokesman for the mayor, however, denied that allegation
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said he refused to give up his bid for a second term,
adding that he would not be part of "a conspiracy" to remove him.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of those themes have long been part of the evaluation
of Parks, the chief introduced a new charge Tuesday. He said he is
suspicious of millions of dollars sent from the city government to
the Police Protective League for the purpose of defending officers in
misconduct hearings. Parks said he doubts whether the money was used
for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would the city give this money to the league at this time, as
they did?" the chief asked. "Was it to give them a war chest to go
after me?" He did not substantiate that claim, which union leaders
and others denied.</TE>
<TE>   Though Parks blamed political decisions for the LAPD's reduced
street presence in recent years, others have suggested that his
leadership has contributed to woeful morale and attrition. Parks
disagreed, arguing that recruitment and retention of officers is a
nationwide problem.</TE>
<TE>   In closing, he warned the council to consider the ramifications
that its actions could have on the secession efforts in the San
Fernando Valley and other areas of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another voter revolt that is directed toward the
governance of the city," Parks said. "They are not asking to be
separated from this Police Department. They are asking to be
separated from their governance in this body and in the mayor's
office.... That should be a real wake-up call for everyone in this
room."</TE>
<TE>   After the chief's presentation, Caruso defended the panel's
evaluation of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he had a very fair process and the commission really did
have as its No.-1 priority to make sure the process was fair and
everything was looked at from both sides," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Parks had every opportunity to answer questions the
commissioners had about his conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a high regard for the chief and would never want to attack
his name, and that is certainly not my intent," he added. "But he's
put himself in a process in which those kinds of questions need to be
asked. I think the commission would be remiss if we didn't. I was
very fair to the chief. Eyeball to eyeball, we talked about things."</TE>
<TE>   Grasso, who was in the council chamber for the chief's remarks,
rejected his assertion that the police union has been controlling
Parks' reappointment process.</TE>
<TE>   "Those remarks are absurd," she said. "And while I'm flattered
that he attributes so much power to the Police Protective League, all
we ever really did was embark on a community education campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We made our point and then we stepped back," she said. "We have
not continued in this grand conspiracy that he illustrates."</TE>

<HD>Spending Limits OKd in Special Elections</HD>
<DH>Campaigns: Supervisors give preliminary approval to closing
a loophole in county law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>County supervisors gave preliminary approval Tuesday to closing a
loophole in a countywide campaign spending law so that it includes
special elections.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote came at the request of Shirley Grindle, a
government activist who helped write the county's campaign spending
law, which up to now limited contributions to $1,000 for candidates
in primary and general elections but not in special elections.</LD>
<LD>   The change could come into play soon, if Supervisor Todd Spitzer
wins his bid for a state Assembly seat.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer is the Republican nominee for the 71st Assembly District,
which is largely Republican, and expects to be elected in November.
Democrat Bea Foster, a Santa Ana teacher, is also running.</TE>
<TE>   Voters last month created a county charter that calls for holding
special elections to fill vacancies on the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The charter, written by Spitzer, was promoted as a means to
provide for greater representation, though Democrats believed it was
a ploy by Republicans to prevent Democratic Gov. Gray Davis from
appointing a replacement from his party.</TE>
<TE>   The extended limits on spending would prevent candidates
anticipating a special election for Spitzer's seat from collecting
unlimited amounts for their campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The limit on special-elections spending will come up for a second
reading at next week's meeting. It would become effective 30 days
after that date.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park) is the only announced
candidate for the expected vacancy, although Orange City Councilman
Mike Alvarez has formed a political action committee.</TE>
<TE>   In telephone interviews, both Campbell and Alvarez said they
supported the campaign changes and would abide by them, before and
after they become effective.</TE>
<TE>   Grindle also is seeking to tackle the use of slate mailers, which
surfaced as a concern in the recent elections.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors wanted to address slate mailers in Tuesday's action
but dropped it because the item was not on the agenda. The board
instructed county counsel to return within 60 days with
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Grindle said, is that slate mailers that highlight
primarily one candidate circumvent the county's campaign laws because
there are no restrictions on donations for the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   She offered as an example the mailers in a recent board race, in
which Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad was defeated for reelection by
Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby.</TE>
<TE>   Norby benefited from a dozen slate mailers that either featured
him or criticized Coad and were funded in part by South County
opponents of an airport at El Toro.</TE>

<HD>2 Women Held in Beating of Man in Simi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY and ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley woman and her teenage daughter have been arrested for
allegedly setting fire to her husband's bedroom and then beating him
in the head with a baseball bat.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Shannon Childs, 37, and her daughter, Jennifer Lee Childs,
19, were booked Monday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder,
attempted murder and aggravated arson.</LD>
<LD>   The women are being held at the Ventura County Jail on $500,000
bail each.</LD>
<TE>   Simi Valley police said the assault against Larry Childs, 55,
occurred about 5 a.m. March 25 at the family home in the 2700 block
of Atherwood Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   One or both of the women set fire to Larry Childs' bedroom and
then began bashing his head with a bat as he lay in the bed, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and firefighters responding to the fire found Childs
bleeding with multiple head injuries, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents across the street said they were awakened by the fire
trucks' sirens and the howling of neighborhood dogs.</TE>
<TE>   One neighborhood resident recalled seeing the victim being helped
by a next-door neighbor before police arrived, and the next day, she
said, the two women returned to the house and used a garden hose to
wash blood from the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of what they say has been a complicated investigation,
police gathered enough information to arrest the wife and
step-daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The single-family home, situated in a middle-income neighborhood
near Atherwood Elementary School, shows no obvious signs of fire or
smoke damage.</TE>
<TE>   Most neighbors said they didn't know much about the family except
to describe them as polite and quiet.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor who identified herself only as Margie said Eileen
Childs was a "very nice lady, very loving" who liked to take her two
sons and daughter swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter was also well-behaved and polite, the neighbor said.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Kirk Shores, 58, said he saw Larry Childs the
morning after the fire walking to a police car with his head heavily
bandaged.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen him since," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police, citing privacy issues, are releasing little information on
the case or the arrest, but Det. Randy Foushee said there has been no
evidence that the attack was in retaliation for abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show Larry Childs was named as the defendant in a
domestic-violence civil suit filed by his wife on March 26, a day
after the fire and beating.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Eileen Childs filed for divorce.</TE>
<TE>   And on Tuesday--the day after his wife and step-daughter's
arrest--Larry Childs filed a domestic-violence suit against Jennifer
Childs.</TE>
<TE>   For some residents, the arrest came as a relief because they had
worried the incident may have been a random attack. "It was driving
us crazy not knowing what was going on," said Cindy Rhea, 41. "We
thought it was a robbery."</TE>
<TE>   The Childs are set to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. today.</TE>

<HD>Camarillo 1st at Statewide Envirothon Competition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five environmental whiz kids from Camarillo High School have taken
first place in a statewide academic competition, earning them a
chance to compete against teams from across the country this summer
in Massachusetts.</LD>
<LD>   This is the third state championship in a row for the school's
Envirothon team, which finished 10th at national finals last year.</LD>
<LD>   "I am so excited, to compete and just to travel across the
country," said senior Maggie Valliant, 17. "Every member of this team
really feels something for this award."</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, it was unclear whether the school would even
have a team. Chad Pridgen, who coached the team for four years, was
arrested in February and has been on unpaid leave from the Oxnard
Union High School District since then. He faces 39 counts of sex
crimes involving 11 teenage boys.</TE>
<TE>   Initially 25 students on two teams were involved in the program,
but the controversy caused many to drop out, leaving one five-member
team.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have easily let that get them down," said Jennifer
Ares, vice president of the California Envirothon. "The fact that
they stuck together, then came back and won--it was great."</TE>
<TE>   The Envirothon is a national academic competition that quizzes
high school students on issues facing the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-six teams, sponsored by resource conservation districts
throughout the state, competed this year. The Camarillo team is
sponsored by the Ventura County district in Somis.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors complete written tests and hands-on projects in
forestry, wildlife, aquatics and soils. A fifth category that changes
each year requires students to develop a plan to solve a hypothetical
problem. This year, the topic was invasive species.</TE>
<TE>   At the state finals in Oakhurst last week, seniors Valliant, Tyler
LeBrun, Kristen Rhodes, Sean Carroll and junior Nathan Crouther had
to devise a plan that would eradicate the yellow star thistle, a
nonnative plant species, from a fictional Central California town.
They delivered their solution in an oral presentation before a panel
of judges.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the three-day event, the Camarillo team was named
the winner, again beating their main rivals, two teams from Arlington
High School in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "We were shocked, excited and overjoyed," said LeBrun, 17.</TE>
<TE>   To get to that point, they spent many hours reading books,
memorizing a 6-inch-thick packet of material, cruising Web sites and
meeting with environmental professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Now the team begins preparing for the finals at the end of July.</TE>
<TE>   Though the topics from state to national finals are the same, the
questions are based on the environment around the host town of
Amherst. So students will spend the next few months familiarizing
themselves with the tree species and soil characteristics of New
England, said new coach Lyn Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Perry, a former field biologist completing her first year of
teaching, went with the team to nationals last year and had worked
with Pridgen as an assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   Taking on the responsibility was a tough decision, but it paid
off, Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think because of all the adversity, it makes this win that much
more sweet," Perry said. "They felt they had something to prove, and
despite all the negative things going on around them, they used that
energy in a positive way."</TE>

<HD>Parks Suggests Union Misused City Cash</HD>
<DH>Payments: Officials of Protective League call LAPD chief's
claim 'a dishonest statement.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of L.A. Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' combative speech to the
City Council covered the familiar terrain of his reappointment
effort--crime rates, morale, community policing and discipline. But
the chief leveled one new blockbuster claim, suggesting that the
police union used $3.5 million in city money to campaign against his
reappointment.</LD>
<LD>   The Police Protective League received the money during the last
year from the city as part of a contract negotiated between the union
and Police Department in July 2000 to compensate the league for
taking over the representation of officers at internal disciplinary
police hearings.</LD>
<LD>   Under the contract, the union will get $6.5 million over 18 months
to assist it as it assumes the job of representing officers accused
of misconduct, a task that had been handled and paid for by the
Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   The city already has begun making those payments, even though the
union has been slow to assume the task of defending the officers,
lending weight to the chief's questions about how the money is being
used. At the same time, the league did set out to raise more than $1
million this year to run an advertising campaign against the chief.</TE>
<TE>   But officials on various sides of the issue and documents relating
to it reveal no evidence of a direct link between the payments the
union received from the city and the money it used to pay for a
television advertising campaign, which the league pulled after one
day at the urging of Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   During his hourlong speech Tuesday, Parks suggested that the money
had been used in the union's political campaign because the city
began paying the league before the union started defending officers.</TE>
<TE>   "One can only wonder why the Police Protective League was given
this largess by the city for doing nothing," he said in his speech.
"Was it to give them a war chest to go after me?"</TE>
<TE>   Union officials Tuesday denied that any city money for the
representation of officers had been used in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a dishonest statement," said Hank Hernandez, general
counsel for the league. "We have not spent money allocated to legal
defense of officers on this campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The union, which was supposed to begin representing officers
accused of misconduct last May, did not take up the job until
October, league officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a plan in place to step in and represent officers," said
Hernandez. "But it was the department management who kept assigning
defense reps."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan countered that the department continued
doing the job because the union hadn't stepped up to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers need a defense, are entitled to a defense," said
Brennan, who added that he believes the league still has not fully
taken over the task. "Whether or not the league was ready for the
responsibility, we didn't want to leave the officers in the lurch."</TE>
<TE>   According to City Administrative Officer William Fujioka, who
negotiated the contract for the city, a dispute about the terms of
the contract stalled the transfer of defense representation from the
LAPD to the union.</TE>
<TE>   The union felt that it should only have to represent officers at
Board of Rights hearings, the most serious level of a discipline
hearing.</TE>

<HD>Mikels Criticizes Health Director</HD>
<DH>Government: The county supervisor says medical system under
Durand lacks accountability. Split of Behavioral Health to be
studied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County Supervisor Judy Mikels lashed out at county Health
Care Agency Director Pierre Durand on Tuesday, accusing him and other
top health officials of running the county's medical system as a
fiefdom with little public accountability.</LD>
<LD>   The Health Care Agency and the Behavioral Health Department, which
the agency oversees, "do not believe they are part of the county,"
Mikels said. "They do not believe they have to report to the Board of
Supervisors. They do not believe the Board of Supervisors makes
policy.... But it is the board's responsibility to hold everyone
accountable."</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting Tuesday, Mikels joined her board colleagues in
unanimously authorizing a study of whether to move Behavioral Health
out from under Durand's control and have the department report
directly to County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston.</LD>
<TE>   The board also plans to review the performance of Behavioral
Health Director David Gudeman. Critics say he has failed to provide
needed mental health services and that he feuds with other county
agency heads over which budget should be used to pay for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said his report on whether Behavioral Health should be a
separate agency will take about a month to complete. Twenty-six other
California counties, including Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, already
follow that model.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations on Gudeman's future will come much more quickly,
possibly in the next week or two, the county chief said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working on this issue for five months, so I should be
able to pull that together pretty quickly," Johnston said. "The real
question is: Is the board satisfied? It was pretty clear to me that
the board is not satisfied--nor is the community. My preliminary
findings are that I am not very satisfied either."</TE>
<TE>   Mikels' comments about the Health Care Agency are significant
because she has in the past been one of Durand's strongest defenders
on the Board of Supervisors. Her criticism could indicate that
political support for the powerful agency head is slipping.</TE>
<TE>   Durand's $242-million agency administers a web of health services,
including Ventura County Medical Center, public health programs, the
coroner's office and the mental health division. Durand is credited
with updating the county's aging public hospital, opening a series of
community clinics used by poor families and offering a low-cost
health insurance program to county employees.</TE>
<TE>   But his leadership of the Behavioral Health Department has been
more controversial. Former Behavioral Health Director Steve Kaplan
supported an attempt to move the department out of Durand's control.
Kaplan said he felt that Durand was focusing on the hospital, not
mental health services.</TE>
<TE>   The move sparked a bureaucratic war and prompted several state and
federal investigations. One federal inquiry into the county's billing
practices resulted in a $15.3-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan resigned and supervisors, in a split vote, gave the job to
Gudeman, Durand's hand-picked replacement. Critics say the turf wars
have continued under Gudeman's watch.</TE>
<TE>   Durand declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels, reached after the meeting, said she still admires Durand's
abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Pierre is successful," Mikels said. "But there seems to be this
migration from feeling like a part of county government to acting
like a stand-alone agency already. And I always say, 'Where there's
smoke, there's fire.'"</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman defended his department and the Health Care Agency as
being well-run. He said his department has increased mental health
services even as his budget was slashed.</TE>
<TE>   The mental health chief, a UCLA-trained psychiatrist, said he
welcomes any evaluation of his performance.</TE>
<TE>   "The board had a spirited discussion today and I hope the county
will make wise decisions," he said. "I'm going to do what I'm told
and do a good job as a physician and administrator."</TE>

<HD>Panel Urges Radioactive Waste Tests at Landfills</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing a distrust of federal regulatory agencies, a Los Angeles City
Council committee recommended Tuesday that its inspectors test
landfills for levels of radioactive waste.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to see if the federal government is lying to us,"
Councilman Nate Holden said during a special meeting of the city's
Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to make sure Los Angeles citizens are safe," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The move follows reports that Rocketdyne's Santa Susana field
laboratory near Chatsworth disposed of low-level radioactive
materials at Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley without the knowledge of
state or local regulators or the landfill operators.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state agencies assured the committee that health
risks, including cancer, that are associated with the low-level
radioactive material are minimal.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Energy is cleaning up the Rocketdyne site.</TE>
<TE>   The council committee also reiterated its support for legislation
calling for stringent disposal of radioactive materials.</TE>
