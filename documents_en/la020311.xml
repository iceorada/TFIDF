<LD>Q: Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?</LD>
<LD>   A: It may be a vegetable in the supermarket, but everywhere else
it is a fruit. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a fruit--in
a strict botanical sense--is the fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a
plant, enclosing the seed or seeds. So apricots, bananas and grapes
are fruits. But so, too, are bean pods, corn grains, tomatoes,
cucumbers and (in their shells) acorns and almonds.</LD>

<LD>River blindness, a devastating disease that affects 18 million people
in Africa and Latin America, is caused by parasitic worms, but it may
be bacteria carried by the worms that do the actual damage, an
international team reported in the March 8 edition of Science. The
finding may lead to new ways to treat and prevent the disease,
because the bacteria in question, Wolbachia, can be readily killed by
the common antibiotic doxycycline.</LD>

<HD>Rage Against the Machines: 'T3's' Rocky Road</HD>
<DH>Developing the latest 'Terminator' installment is fraught
with rancor and hugely expensive--and filming hasn't even begun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>The story behind T3 by Rachel Abramowitz</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In all of film history, there are few characters iconic enough to
speak across generations and national divide. One of those is the
Terminator, a grim hallucination from the future, a totem of
invincible, implacable masculinity.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody on the planet can tell you the Terminator wears a black
leather jacket," says director Jonathan Mostow. "This character is so
burned into our movie consciousness. There are very few mythologies
that are known all over the world."</LD>
<LD>   Thus, imagine the glee that swept through the executive suites of
Hollywood this past December as every studio head was invited to a
secret hotel room meeting to read a new installment of the franchise,
"Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines," and bid for the
distribution rights to the film.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't matter that its star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, at 54, was
an aging Terminator whose box office gross in recent films had fallen
off faster that you can say "Hasta la vista." It didn't matter that
its original writer-director, James Cameron, now the Academy Award
winning writer-director of the highest-grossing film of all time,
"Titanic," had been replaced by Mostow, director of the submarine
movie "U-571," or that actress Linda Hamilton, who'd made delineated
biceps a fashion must-have, wasn't taking part. It didn't even matter
that it had been a decade since the last installment and its prime
audience of teens was too young to have seen the first two during
their theatrical runs.</TE>
<TE>   All the studios (save for Fox, out of loyalty to Cameron) came and
made offers and pitches. Almost never in film history has an
established franchise been put up for sale. Though Hollywood has
always been sequel-friendly, in the past year it's become positively
sequel mad, with sequels to "Men in Black," "Lord of the Rings:
Fellowship of the Ring" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
all heading for the box office. It's not simply that Hollywood loves
sure bets. In an industry where almost every studio is owned by a
conglomerate, these kinds of franchises are not viewed just as movies
but as perfect vehicles for corporate synergies--conceptual widgets
to be plugged on cable and the Internet, through books and theme
parks, records, and merchandising.</TE>
<TE>   "Terminator 3" starts production next month, and if all goes
according to plan, it will arrive in theaters in summer 2003,
courtesy of Warner Bros. (here) and Sony (abroad). At a budget
insiders put at $172 million, it is the most expensive independently
financed movie ever made, although only roughly $90 million of that
budget is going to actual physical production. Besides
Schwarzenegger's Terminator-size compensation (hovering in the $30
million range, depending how you count the perk package) and Mostow's
$5 million price tag, the rest of the money is going to the various
rights-holders and backstage players.</TE>
<TE>   It's Hollywood's equivalent of blood money, payment for surviving
and winning what has been a byzantine struggle to make a film that
involves a busted marriage, torched friendships and two producers
beating their way back from Siberia. It's taken all that effort to
make sure that the Terminator once again utters his trademark
aphorism: "I'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Creation of the Little</TE>
<TE>   Sleeper That Could</TE>
<TE>   Ironically enough, the first time Cameron sold the rights, it only
cost a dollar and the price of ambition. Then a neophyte
writer-director, the auteur of the little-seen "Piranha 2" had
co-written the script with fledgling producer Gale Anne Hurd, his
future wife. It is the story of a cyborg sent back from the future to
kill an innocent woman whose unborn child will grow up to lead
mankind in a revolution against sentient machines. Cameron sold Hurd
his half of the rights, under the strict provision that he be allowed
to direct.</TE>
<TE>   The little $6.4 million sleeper grossed a modest $36.9 million in
1984 but launched both his and Schwarzenegger's careers.</TE>
<TE>   Hemdale, the company that made the film, went bankrupt in 1992.
The high-flying independent Carolco Pictures, purveyor of the "Rambo"
series (for which Cameron penned "Rambo: First Blood Part 2"), which
had already snatched up Hemdale's portion of the rights for $10
million, paid $7 million to Hurd, now Cameron's ex-wife, for her
rights, and together with Cameron fashioned "Terminator 2: Judgment
Day." At the price of about $113 million, then the most expensive
movie ever made, the film nearly capsized the company but went on to
be a juggernaut, grossing $517 million worldwide, winning four
Academy Awards and breaking new ground in special effects.</TE>
<TE>   Then Carolco Pictures, beset by a series of bombs such as
"Showgirls" and "Cutthroat Island," went bankrupt in 1995, and it was
at the Carolco bankruptcy auction in October 1997 that a 50% share in
the franchise came up for sale and the current saga began.</TE>
<TE>   On that day in 1997, a number of interested parties turned out to
take part in the bidding, from Miramax's Bob Weinstein to Hurd, who
maintained the other 50% of the rights. . Cameron was in the throes
of finishing "Titanic," but his interests were represented by an
attorney from Fox, the studio which was making "Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Court, a Diverse</TE>
<TE>   Cast of Characters</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Carolco had begun to flounder in 1995, Fox chairman
Bill Mechanic had been meticulously assembling a deal for "Terminator
3" in which Cameron, Schwarzenegger and Hurd would forgo much of
their hefty upfront fees for a bigger piece of back-end profits.
Cameron had committed only to writing and producing. "He was
uncertain if he'd direct it, although he reserved the right to direct
it," says Rae Sanchini, president of Cameron's company, Lightstorm
Entertainment. (Cameron declined to comment for this article.) "He
wanted to be involved in shepherding it and making sure it was done
right. He wanted to be there for Arnold."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most surprising attendees were Mario Kassar and Andy
Vajna, the co-founders of Carolco Pictures recently reunited as
business partners after an eight-year separation.</TE>
<TE>   More than anyone, the Lebanese-born Kassar had been responsible
for the demise of Carolco, through poor movie choices and lavish
spending. He was famous for cruising the Cannes Film Festival in a
200-foot yacht. When Schwarzenegger wanted a plane in lieu of salary
on "Terminator 2," Kassar bought him a nifty $14 million Gulfstream
III.Indeed, it had been Kassar's open-wallet policies that had
initially driven a wedge between him and Hungarian business partner
Vajna, leading Kassar to buy out Vajna's shares in the company in
1989 for a reported $107.5 million. His film ambitions were in the
midst of crumbling and at auction time, he was dissolving his company
Cinergi, which had produced "Die Hard With a Vengeance" as well as
such bombs as 1995's "The Scarlet Letter." A federal grand jury was
also investigating both men's 1980s tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   Still, both men had remained close to Cameron, close enough that
he'd recently invited them to see an early edit of "Titanic" and have
a meal afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Neither mentioned an interest in "Terminator 3," so the director
was reportedly shocked and furious to hear that within days, the pair
had made a deal with bankruptcy court to snatch Cameron's baby out
from under him, paying $7.5 million for Carolco's 50% rights to the
franchise and the opportunity to match any higher bids at the
auction.</TE>
<TE>   Vajna claims that he'd never considered buying "Terminator" until
that foray to see "Titanic." "The whole idea came as a result of that
screening," says the producer. "We found that the rights for
'Terminator' were still there and nobody had ever made a bid for it."
"All I knew is that Jim felt this was his creation, and why were they
interfering in the process?" recalls Mechanic, who was on the phone
with Cameron as the Fox attorney representing Cameron's interests
stood by in the courtroom that day in 1997.  "It had been John Daly
at Hemdale who'd made the first movie, not Mario and Andy. They did
the second. Mainly this was [Cameron's] work. He was the guy to do it
or not to do it." Mechanic asked Cameron if he wanted the studio to
top the bid, but Cameron said he "didn't want to be in it."</TE>
<TE>   "I felt he was only hanging in there at the end because of Arnold
and quality control. It was something that Arnold always wanted to do
again. Period. And Jim was more than happy to do it."</TE>
<TE>   By several accounts, Cameron was furious with Kassar and Vajna, a
fury that permanently damaged their once close relationship. Vajna
says he called both Cameron and Schwarzenegger that night to try to
right the situation and professes amazement that Cameron should be
angry.</TE>
<TE>   "What difference does it make to Jim who's financing the movie, a
studio or us?" Vajna says. "His deal would have been the same. Arnold
tried to convince Jim over a long period of time to do the film.
Arnold felt very loyal."</TE>
<TE>   More discussion between Fox and Kassar and Vajna followed.
Mechanic, who was then chairman of the studio, says the talks were
never serious. Vajna says the studio tried to buy the rights from
them for Cameron. "They made a proposal. We accepted, but it fell
apart over chain of title issues." Sanchini says the hiccup came over
the fact that Kassar and Vajna had sold off rights in Germany and
Japan, the two biggest territories outside of the U.S. (According to
production sources, Vajna and Kassar ultimately paid Hurd $7 million
for her rights.)</TE>
<TE>   "It was not an easy decision for Jim to walk away from
'Terminator,'" says Sanchini. "He felt great ownership of the
material even though he in fact never owned it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, before Schwarzenegger signed on he came to see Cameron to
ask for his blessing--and, according to Sanchini, received it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Power of a Star</TE>
<TE>   and a Signature Franchise</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger's box office appeal is not what it used to be, but
he's consistently been a bigger draw overseas. Indeed, 1991's
"Terminator 2" was one of the first films to prove the rising force
of the international box office. The film earned $200 million here
and $300 million abroad. Still, his recent numbers have been on a
downward spiral. . His latest film, "Collateral Damage," has grossed
only $37 million here.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, however, provokes a different
reaction. According to a studio representative, when Schwarzenegger
recently dropped by a sales conference at Sony, which will distribute
the film internationally, the foreign exhibitors went nuts.</TE>
<TE>   Mostow, whom Kassar and Vajna tapped to replace Cameron, says,
"Obviously, I'd be lying to say it wasn't daunting working in his
shadow. The bar has been set very high."</TE>
<TE>   There's still Schwarzenegger to provide authentic Terminator
wisdom, says Mostow. "I feel like I'm making the Bible and I'm
getting to work with Moses. If there's any question about the
Terminator, you've got Arnold to talk to. He's lived with this
character for 17 years."</TE>
<TE>   Mostow has spent much of the last year holed up with screenwriters
Mike Ferris and John Brancato ("The Net"), friends from his college
days at Harvard, reworking an early draft of the script by Tedi
Sarafian, which had been roundly panned on the Internet Web site
Ain't It Cool News.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically enough, it was the power of the Internet that helped
Warner Bros. secure the domestic rights to the film for $50 million
plus close to that amount in prints and advertising. These rights
include the lucrative DVD and video market.</TE>
<TE>   Their winning pitch involved promotional plugs on America Online
as well as what can only be called a "Matrix" sandwich. Of all films
set for 2003 release, Warner's two "Matrix" sequels, with their
mystical sci-fi martial arts bent, loomed in the minds of the "T3"
team as their biggest competition. That threat has now been
neutralized--"T3" will arrive in theaters on the heels of "Matrix 2,"
set for a spring release, and before "Matrix 3," to arrive over the
holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one question remains. With all the worldwide rights sold
for $145 million, that still leaves a $25 million budget shortfall to
be covered by Vajna, Kassar and their partner, Intermedia, an
entertainment investment company. They expect to reap their rewards
through the merchandising rights and bonuses, when and if the film
reaches certain box office plateaus.</TE>
<TE>   Says Vajna, "We believe 'Terminator 3' will reignite Mario's and
my partnership."</TE>

<HD>Animated Pop Band Takes to the Stage</HD>
<DH>Real-life members of the group Gorillaz perform behind a
screen as videos of the cartoon quartet are projected to the
audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'm useless, but not for long," a voice from behind a giant video
screen declared during Gorillaz's sold-out concert Friday at the
Hollywood Palladium. "My future is coming ... I'm happy."</LD>
<LD>   The line is from "Clint Eastwood," the most popular track on
Gorillaz's self-titled 2001 hit album--and it's easy to look at the
words as a battle cry for this unusual pop enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   In Gorillaz, the project's creators, chiefly singer-songwriter
Damon Albarn and artist-animator Jamie Hewlett, are poking fun at
pop-rock convention.</LD>
<TE>   With the music and image of so many pop artists these days being
manufactured by hired songwriters and producers, Albarn and Hewlett
figured they'd put together the ultimate hollow act: a cartoon
quartet that exists only on the video screen.</TE>
<TE>   One way, then, to look at the "Clint Eastwood" lyric is that it's
today's pop-rock experience that is useless. And that a happier
future is just a little imagination away.</TE>
<TE>   With Gorillaz, Albarn and Hewlett attempt to supply that
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   In the project, Albarn and some friends, notably dance-world
record producer-conceptualist Dan "the Automator" Nakamura, supply
the music, which blends everything from Clash-era rock to
electronica, hip-hop and a touch of reggae. Hewlett, best known for
the British comic strip "Tank Girl," oversaw the animation.</TE>
<TE>   It's a gimmick that caught the pop world's ear on record, and the
Gorillaz concert tour maintains the joke by having Albarn, Nakamura
and other musicians perform in anonymity behind the screen. The only
thing the audience sees is videos of the cartoon band.</TE>
<TE>   It is a concept that is part MTV and part Cartoon Network, and in
the idea-starved rock world it's enough to make the live show one of
the year's most anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   On the way into the Palladium, where Gorillaz sold out two nights,
fans in line were asking one another lots of obvious questions:</TE>
<TE>   Would musicians really be playing behind the screen? Would the
music just be on tape? Would it matter?</TE>
<TE>   There has been lots of exaggerated visual emphasis in rock's past,
including the psychedelic light shows of the '60s, which worked
mainly because most of the audience was stoned. Yet even back then
the musicians were visible on stage.</TE>
<TE>   There's a sweet edginess to these four cute characters, who are
like an older, rock 'n' roll version of the gang in "South Park." The
leader is 2D, a likable takeoff on the classic pretty-boy lead
singer. Murdoc is a moody, mysterious guitarist in the Keith Richards
tradition; Noodle is the band's female member; and Russel is the
hip-hop component.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of Friday's show, all four appeared in a small
cartoon on a screen high above the stage. As the music began, the
image grew until it filled the top half of the huge screen. In the
bottom were the shadowy outlines of the musicians at work.</TE>
<TE>   The music doesn't offer the songwriting sophistication of Beck,
the soulfulness of Moby or the sonic thrill ride of the Prodigy, to
cite three rival cross-cultural navigators. Still, it is solid,
invigorating stuff, from the high-energy dance-rock mix of "M1 A1" to
the moody dreamscape of "Tomorrow Comes Today."</TE>
<TE>   Far less winning Friday were the mostly flat and uninvolving
visuals. The biggest surprise was how little the characters were
featured. Rather than follow them on some interesting exploits, the
show simply put them through generic paces or ignored them altogether
in favor of flashing images that could have fit into old psychedelic
light shows.</TE>
<TE>   The most amusing aspect of the hourlong set was that you found
yourself so bored with the visuals that you kept straining to see the
band members through the screen.</TE>
<TE>   While walking around the ballroom near the end of the show, I came
across a TV monitor on the soundboard that enabled the engineers to
see the musicians. Albarn, leader of the English rock group Blur, and
his cohorts were jumping around energetically, just the way they
would if they were in front of the screen.</TE>
<TE>   There was an almost sweet innocence about their enthusiasm, and it
was a reminder of the importance of the emotional connection between
performer and fan. The odds are Gorillaz could have gotten the
loudest response of the night by simply lifting the screen and
letting everyone see the musicians at work.</TE>
<TE>   Without that, Albarn and the others seemed prisoners of their own
creation. It may be too harsh to call the Gorillaz stage show
useless, but it was far from an enticing door to rock's future.</TE>

<HD>New AIDS Drugs Still a Distant Glimmer</HD>
<DH>Research: With current therapies bedeviled by serious side
effects and growing viral resistance, hopes are fading for a quick
breakthrough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AIDS researchers don't like to admit that the field is in a slump,
but it is hard to escape that conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   There have been no major breakthroughs since the development of
protease inhibitors six years ago. Many patients have stopped taking
anti-AIDS drugs because of a growing incidence of both side effects
and resistance to the drugs by the AIDS virus. And people continue to
be infected at a rate that hasn't changed for a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, any better control of the AIDS epidemic is going to take
a lot longer than scientists had expected or predicted even a few
years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Nowhere was this more apparent than at the ninth annual Retrovirus
Conference in Seattle last month. Although researchers reported
glimmers of hope in several new approaches to AIDS drugs, it will
require years of hard work before any of those hopes are realized.</TE>
<TE>   "It's becoming more and more difficult to make a major
breakthrough" in AIDS research, said Dr. Raymond Schinazi of Emory
University in Atlanta. "All the easy stuff has already been done."</TE>
<TE>   Progress in the last two or three years has been "absolutely
glacial," said Lee Klosinski, director of programs for AIDS Project
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't expecting a great deal this year, and we didn't get
it," added Dr. Harvey A. Elder of Loma Linda University Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   And while the pace of research has seemingly slowed, the progress
of the epidemic has not. Therapeutic advances have slashed the U.S.
AIDS death rate from 40,000 per year to 15,000, but the number of new
infections has held steady at about 40,000 per year. As a
consequence, almost 1 million Americans are living with an HIV
infection, according to new estimates from the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   And as people are spending longer times taking AIDS drugs, new
complications are becoming apparent. Foremost among them are a number
of side effects caused by the drugs themselves, ranging from simple
nausea and lethargy to abnormal fat distribution on the body, high
cholesterol levels, diabetes and now, new research suggests, an
increased risk of heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The side effects can be so severe that many patients are
abandoning therapy, with disastrous consequences. New data show that
those who quit taking drugs are much more likely to develop AIDS or
to die.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, those who are doing well on the drugs are also facing
some new problems that they didn't expect.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly alarming to physicians at the recent meeting is the
growing incidence of liver disease caused by co-infection by the
hepatitis B and C viruses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're becoming liver doctors as much as anything else," said Dr.
David Stone, an AIDS treatment specialist at Lemuel Shattuck Hospital
in Boston. "Fifty percent of our patients' deaths since 1999 have
been from liver disease."</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, these patients didn't live long enough for their
hepatitis infections to become a problem," added Elder. "Now we have
to treat for both HIV and hepatitis."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Protease Inhibitors' Side Effects Puzzle Doctors</TE>
<TE>   There has been a gross change in researchers' mood since the
introduction of protease inhibitors six years ago. Their powerful
antiviral effect led scientists to hope that we were on the road to
controlling the AIDS epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   But the side effects of the drugs and the growing resistance of
the virus to therapy have dampened enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the side effects of therapy have been attributed to the
protease inhibitors specifically, especially increases in cholesterol
levels and dysfunctions in fat metabolism. Now, possibly as a result
of those changes in lipid metabolism, the drugs are also being linked
to heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Scott Holmberg and his colleagues at the CDC in Atlanta
studied 5,675 HIV-positive people in eight cities, half of whom were
taking protease inhibitors. Heart attacks were rare in this group,
probably because the patients were relatively young.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, there were 13 heart attacks among those taking
protease inhibitors, compared with only two among the patients not
taking the drugs--a more than fivefold increase in risk.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unusual to see relative risk ratios like that" unless
the drugs were causing it, Holmberg said. "We think we are seeing an
early but still relatively small problem."</TE>
<TE>   A study at UC San Diego called those results into question,
however.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Samuel Bozette and his colleagues examined the records of
36,766 HIV-positive veterans over the same time period covered by the
CDC study and found no increase in heart attacks among those taking
protease inhibitors.</TE>
<TE>   "This complication [heart attacks] does not seem to be changing,"
Bozette said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear which study is correct, noted Dr. Harold Jaffe,
who is in charge of AIDS programs at CDC, adding that more research
is needed.</TE>
<TE>   The many side effects of AIDS drugs have led some patients to stop
taking them for brief periods or to quit entirely. A few researchers
hope that brief periods off the drugs--called structured treatment
interruptions--will assist viral control by exposing HIV to the
immune system and stimulating a response. Several studies of this
approach are underway, but no new results were presented here.</TE>
<TE>   A new European study did look at the effect of total withdrawal,
however. Dr. Jens D. Lundgren of the EuroSIDA Coordinating Office in
Denmark presented new details from the 25-country study of AIDS
treatment regimens. Among 3,610 patients in the program receiving
drug cocktails, 16% stopped taking the drugs--many because of side
effects.</TE>
<TE>   Those who stopped completely were six times as likely to develop
AIDS or to die as those who continued receiving the drugs, he said.
Those who stopped for a while and then resumed treatment were still
twice as likely to die, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Some patients stop taking antiviral drugs because the drugs have
simply stopped working for them. HIV is a shifty, constantly mutating
virus that has continually frustrated researchers by rapidly
developing resistance to drugs. Indeed, the whole point of
combination therapy is to reduce viral replication so sharply that
the virus is not able to mutate as readily.</TE>
<TE>   But patients sometimes skip drug doses, enabling the virus to
mutate. At other times the virus simply mutates despite the decrease
in replication. Some patients now carry viruses that are resistant to
many or all of the 15 drugs used to treat HIV infections.</TE>
<TE>   "These are patients who really need new options desperately," said
Dr. Martin Markowitz of the Aaron Diamond AIDS research Center in New
York City.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are thus looking for new drugs that can overcome this
resistance and new classes of drugs that can attack the virus from
entirely different directions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Virus Mutates, Drugs Lose Effectiveness</TE>
<TE>   All of the existing AIDS drugs act against either of two HIV
enzymes, called protease and reverse transcriptase, that are crucial
to replication of the virus. The drugs bind to the so-called active
sites of the enzymes, clogging up the sites and thereby preventing
the virus from carrying out its normal function.</TE>
<TE>   But the drugs bind only weakly, and when the virus develops a
mutation that changes the shape of the binding site slightly, the
drugs lose their effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Tipranavir is a new protease inhibitor that binds more tightly to
the active site than do existing drugs. "It interacts in a more
flexible manner with protease so it is able to bind to drug-resistant
HIV," Markowitz said. Unlike existing protease inhibitors, he said,
it is actually more effective against resistant viruses than it is
against unmutated ones.</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz reported on a 48-week trial in which tipranavir was
combined with another protease inhibitor, called ritonavir, in 41
patients. The combination reduced virus in the blood to undetectable
levels, and none of the patients developed resistance to the new
drug, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Brian Gazzard of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London
described a promising new reverse transcriptase inhibitor called
TMC125, developed by the Belgian company Tibotec-Virco NV, which
seems also to be effective against resistant viruses. In a
preliminary study, he and his colleagues gave the new drug to 12
patients for a week. The drug slashed virus replication in the
patients by 99%--even in patients who were resistant to other reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a very large drop in viral load in the blood" for a single
drug, Gazzard said. "This drug has a very impressive effect, but how
long that effect will last and what the long-term side effects are,
we don't know yet."</TE>
<TE>   "That's a drop unlike anything we've seen before," added Dr. Joep
Lange of the University of Amsterdam. "We need to understand why it
has this particular potency."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest long-term promise for new drugs, however,
lies in those that attack other parts of HIV's replication cycle,
such as its entry into white blood cells. In order to break into the
cells and initiate its own reproduction, the virus must bind to two
receptors, one called CD4 and one called CCR5.</TE>
<TE>   Blocking those receptors to prevent entry could provide a new way
to fight the virus, and preliminary results suggest that it may be
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be remembered as the year of the entry inhibitor," said
Dr. Robert Schooley of the University of Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have been eagerly awaiting the first human trials of a
new CCR5 blocker called SCH C, developed by Schering-Plough Co. Dr.
Mark Laughlin of Schering said he and his colleagues administered the
drug for a week to 12 patients with high virus levels. The drug
reduced virus levels by at least 68% in 10 of the 12 and by 90% in
four of them.</TE>
<TE>   "This adds a new dimension to treatment of HIV," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. has screened more than 100,000 compounds
to find one that will block the CD4 receptor. Pharmacologist Richard
Colonno of the company said they had found one, called BMS805, that
seems to be the first viable candidate for a new drug. Test-tube
studies show that it blocks replication of HIV that is resistant to
all other drugs now in use, he said. The company plans to begin
testing it in humans later this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long-Lasting Interferon Can Slow Hepatitis C</TE>
<TE>   And finally, there was a little bit of good news for patients who
are infected with HIV and the hepatitis C virus. HIV exacerbates the
effects of hepatitis C, causing cirrhosis of the liver to occur 50%
faster than normal, said Dr. Raymond Chung of Harvard Medical School.
But clinicians have been reluctant to use the most powerful
anti-hepatitis drug, interferon, in these patients because of its
strong side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Chung led a government-sponsored study comparing a long-lasting
form of interferon alpha 2-a, called Pegasys, with the conventional
form of interferon. In the long-lasting form, interferon is attached
to a polymer that allows it to stay in the bloodstream at high levels
much longer than does interferon alone. Both versions were given in
conjunction with the anti-hepatitis drug ribavirin, and patients
continued to receive their HIV therapy as well.</TE>
<TE>   At least 90% of the patients were able to tolerate the drugs,
Chung said. And by 24 weeks into the study, 44% of those receiving
Pegasys had undetectable levels of hepatitis C virus in their blood,
compared with only 15% of those receiving conventional interferon.
Even the majority of those who still had circulating virus in their
blood showed liver improvements in a biopsy, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that you could get 90% of these patients through six
months of therapy, that is a phenomenal outcome," said Dr. Constance
Benson of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.</TE>

<HD>Passing Out the Facts on the Causes of Fainting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her youth, my sister (who is not exactly a delicate flower) would
sometimes faint. It was never quite clear why, and the episodes
eventually passed. I was impressed. I couldn't even faint when I
tried, and I did try once, in my teens. A pal devised a kind of
"fainting recipe" that involved antics like rapid inhaling and
exhaling. The antics didn't work.</LD>
<LD>   To learn more about fainting, I peppered some local doctors with
questions about my sister, a woman I know who passed out in church,
smelling salts, Victorian ladies and whether "fainting" is the same
as "swooning" and "passing out."</LD>
<LD>   Dr. William K. Averill, a Torrance cardiologist, and Dr. Marshall
Morgan, chief of emergency medicine at UCLA Medical Center, explained
that the technical term for a faint is "syncope" from the Greek for
"cutting off." (You pronounce the "e" on the end.) Syncopal episodes
happen when the brain is transiently deprived of blood, and they
don't last long: When people faint they tend to fall over, and in
that new position sufficient blood easily gets into the brain again.
(It's not a good idea, say the doctors, to prop someone up when
they're about to faint. Let them lie down.)</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes people faint because they have a serious heart problem,
such as an arrhythmia that leads to a temporary lack of brain blood.
So alert your doctor about any unexplained fainting episodes.
Sometimes they faint because they suddenly exert themselves when they
don't have enough blood coursing through their system--say, after
they've just donated blood. Or they've been standing too long, like a
co-worker who passed out in church. Gravity is working against
getting enough blood to the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes people faint because they're overstimulated: by the
sight of blood, distressing news, an emotional moment. The same
co-worker who passed out in church also fainted after becoming
overwhelmed with sympathy while watching a movie about a man with a
terrible disfigurement. The mind does indeed affect the body.</TE>
<TE>   Our body has a nifty system for making sure we get the right
amount of blood flow no matter what we're doing. When someone's
lolling in bed, his heart, arteries and veins have an easier job.
When someone gets up and lumbers toward the bathroom or fridge, his
circulation is suddenly fighting gravity. The body senses this change
in pressure: The heart rate quickens and blood vessels narrow so that
blood goes to the head instead of ballooning up the ankles.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this tremendous balancing act so when we get out of bed
in the morning we don't drop to the floor and pass out," Averill
says. "It's really cool. You don't think about it, you just get up
and go."</TE>
<TE>   The system's even more impressive in a giraffe, adds Averill.
Consider how much higher the beast's brain is--and thus what a
tougher job its heart and circulation have.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes things go awry--and a key nerve in this balancing
act, called the vagus, gets overstimulated. Other nerves quiet down.
The result: Heart rate drops and blood vessels dilate, and down to
the floor we go.</TE>
<TE>   Some folks are more prone to this kind of a faint than others; no
one quite knows why. And some people will pass out while they're
urinating (it's called micturition syncope), coughing or stimulating
a nerve while swallowing. (Either of the last two could lead to
someone fainting while eating ... maybe a pretzel, say the doctors,
though neither was willing to diagnose the cause of President Bush's
recent tumble.)</TE>
<TE>   Did fluttery Victorian ladies really faint more than today's
sturdier stock? Neither doctor knew of data pertaining to that
matter; it is possible that the National Institutes of Health do not
see that as a high research priority. But UCLA's Morgan says his
favorite faint-prone patient is a "former cop, jet pilot, carouser,
drinker and good-time tough guy."</TE>
<TE>   And was there any rationale at all for the silly fainting recipe
my pal had gotten from who knows where--inhaling and exhaling rapidly
and then pinching the nose and straining hard against that pinched
nose?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, yes. Inhaling and exhaling very rapidly causes the
amount of carbon dioxide in the blood to fall--causing blood vessels
to constrict.</TE>
<TE>   And the business of bearing down hard against a pinched-shut nose
even has a special name. "It's a classic Valsalva maneuver," Averill
says. Just as a cough can constrict the chest and potentially
diminish blood flow, so too can such a strain.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, should one really whip out smelling salts and waft them
under the fainted party's nose to bring them round? "People wake up
pretty quickly anyway," Morgan says. "All the smelling salts do is
make the normal, fairly rapid process of waking up a lot more
unpleasant."</TE>

<HD>Resurfacing Techniques Venture Below the Jawline</HD>

<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dead giveaway that a person has "had something done" to his or her
face is if the skin on the backs of the hands or the chest doesn't
match the face. When the body skin is sun-damaged and wrinkled while
the texture and color of the face are fresh and clear as a
teenager's, chances are a laser or chemical peel has been applied to
the face.</LD>
<LD>   Now, more people are having these resurfacing procedures done to
their bodies, bringing hands, arms, chest and faces in sync.</LD>
<LD>   Skin texture and color can be improved, dermatologists are
learning. But Edward Victor Ross, speaking at the American Academy of
Dermatology's annual meeting, said caution should be used when
resurfacing techniques are taken beyond the face.</LD>
<TE>   "Nonfacial skin heals more slowly, so peels should be limited to
the uppermost layer of skin," said Ross, a dermatologist at the Naval
Medical Center in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, he explained that going deeper risks
complications such as scarring, infection and loss of color. A series
of three peels about six weeks apart can improve the crepe-paper
texture and irregular pigmentation that occurs with aging and sun
damage.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go beyond that recipe, you're heading for disaster," he
said, warning that medium and deep peels are not recommended beyond
the jawline.</TE>
<TE>   During the healing process, which can take two to three weeks for
body skin, Ross advised keeping skin hydrated by drinking water,
covering it with an ointment and protecting it from the sun.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homeopathy Is Put to the Test With Asthmatics</TE>
<TE>   Homeopathy is believed to be especially useful for allergies. It
uses a micro dose of a substance that is similar to, or the same as,
whatever causes the allergy or its symptoms. Now British researchers
have put one type of homeopathy to the test in a clinical trial
involving more than 200 asthmatics allergic to dust mites.</TE>
<TE>   The study published recently in the British Medical Journal found
that three doses of a homeopathic dilution of dust mites over a
24-hour period was no better than a placebo. People in both groups
were able to expel more air from their lungs and had an improved
quality of life in the weeks following treatment.</TE>
<TE>   However, there were some differences between the groups. For
example, in the last four weeks of the 16-week study, those in the
treatment group felt the need to use their bronchodilators less often
than those in the placebo group. Although proponents of homeopathy
point to this difference as evidence that the remedy was working, the
study's author, George Lewith of the Complementary Medicine Research
Unit at Royal South Hants Hospital, sees it as proving little. On
tests of actual lung function, the homeopathic treatment was not
better--or more effective--than the placebo.</TE>
<TE>   "But that difference in response says to me that something is
happening," says Dana Ullman, author of numerous books on homeopathy.
He also agrees with a point brought up in an editorial accompanying
the study that says: "Most trials of homeopathic medicine do not
individualize treatment, the hallmark of homeopathic practice." In
this study, everyone in the treatment group received the same dose of
the remedy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nicotine Therapies Encourage More Smokers to Kick the Habit</TE>
<TE>   Ex-smokers often say giving up cigarettes was the hardest thing
they ever did. A few years ago, quitting got a bit easier when
nicotine patches and gum became available over the counter, making
nicotine replacement therapy more readily available. As a result, say
some experts, more smokers than ever decided to try to give up the
habit.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study presented at the annual Society for Research
on Nicotine and Tobacco meeting in Savannah, Ga., there was a 4%
increase in those trying to quit after the prescription-only aids
became available without a doctor's approval.</TE>
<TE>   That number may seem small, but according to researcher Saul
Shiffman, it translates to an increase of about 2 million more
smokers trying to quit. By examining U.S. census data, Shiffman, a
psychology professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and his
colleagues found that in 1999, nearly 40% of American smokers had
tried to stop during the previous year, an increase from 35.6% in the
year before the FDA allowed these nicotine products to be sold over
the counter in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers acknowledge that other smoking cessation efforts
geared toward changing behavior played a role, too.</TE>

<TE>   Study Finds Diet Drugs Yield Only Modest Weight Loss</TE>
<TE>   Many experts think that obesity is a disease and like any other
serious condition could be treated with medication along with diet
and exercise.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, weight-loss drugs are falling short of expectations.
That's what researchers found in the first extensive survey of diet
drug clinical trials. Still, they are hopeful. Diet drugs may be
useful for weight maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   In the 108 studies analyzed, most of the single drugs produced
modest weight loss on average. Obese people taking a single type of
diet drug lost about 41/2 to 9 pounds more than those on a placebo
pill, according to the study published recently in the International
Journal of Obesity.</TE>
<TE>   Most studies included lifestyle management programs and drug
therapy. No drug was clearly superior, but amphetamine,
benzphetamine, fenfluramine and sibutramine were more effective than
the others. Drug combinations were the most successful. People on the
fen-phen combo, which is no longer available, lost 14 pounds. The
only totally ineffective drug was benzocaine. Most diet drugs had
their greatest impact early in treatment. The rate of weight loss
decreased the longer many of the drugs were taken. Weight maintenance
is another matter. In this area, the drugs may be most useful.
According to Dr. C. Keith Haddock, assistant professor of psychology
and medicine at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, two recent
studies found that people who had lost weight on a very low calorie
diet were able to maintain 80% to 100% of the loss for at least a
year when they took sibutramine (Meridia).</TE>

<HD>Fitness Clubs Are Urged to Install Defibrillators</HD>
<DH>Lifesaving: With the graying of gyms, two doctors' groups
say the devices should be on hand in case a client suffers a heart
attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Devices to shock stopped hearts back into normal rhythm have become
common in airports, shopping malls, stadiums and schools--but not
fitness clubs. Now doctors are saying it's time that changed.</LD>
<LD>   The American Heart Assn. and the American College of Sports
Medicine are urging that gyms and health centers, frequented by
increasing numbers of middle-age and older people, be equipped with
automatic external defibrillators.</LD>
<LD>   Neither states nor the federal government require that gyms have
the potentially lifesaving devices on hand, and the doctor groups'
joint recommendation, which lacks the force of law, isn't likely to
prompt quick action.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub
Assn. has begun to see the value in having them on hand, and change
could be on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, after two years of batting the issue around, the
Boston-based organization began encouraging its member clubs to
investigate "the advantage of deploying and equipping their
facilities with an AED or AEDs as needed," said William C. Howland
Jr., director of public relations and research for the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Howland cited several reasons for the industry's reluctance to
install the devices. Clubs "had to feel it was truly foolproof,
user-friendly technology, and we didn't feel until recently that the
equipment was," he said. They needed to believe "that a layperson
could reliably use the equipment and not do damage." And the price
had to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Portable defibrillators cost $3,000 to $4,500. Most include simple
directions explaining how to use them when someone has suffered
cardiac arrest, typically brought on by an erratic heart rhythm that
suddenly causes the heart to stop beating.</TE>
<TE>   A survey taken a year ago showed that one out of four IHRSA clubs
had defibrillators. In an interview last week while attending an
international convention of health club operators in Phoenix, Howland
said that "most people you talk to are looking into the equipment....
It will not be long before most of the top operators have gone ahead
and made the investment."</TE>
<TE>   Some club owners remain worried about whether Good Samaritan
laws--which say that a layperson acting in good faith to save
someone's life can't be prosecuted if something goes wrong--would
protect the clubs from legal liability if someone other than a
trained club staffer deployed the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The club owners are also wondering about a very fundamental
factor: How many people are stricken while at the gym?</TE>
<TE>   One survey cited by the doctors found that of the 30 million
people who regularly visit gyms, more than half are older than 35.
And although there are no good data on fatalities in health clubs, a
random survey of 65 facilities in Ohio found that 17% had had a club
member suffer a heart attack or sudden cardiac death in the previous
five years. Only 3% of the facilities had defibrillators when the
emergency occurred. Another study of 2.9 million members of a large
health club chain found 71 deaths in a two-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the infrequency of the incidents, Howland said, "we have
members who have deployed AEDs and in their first year have reported
saves."</TE>
<TE>   The advice from the two doctors' groups, which appeared in the
March 4 issue of the American Heart Assn.'s journal Circulation,
updates recommendations made in 1998, when the groups advised health
clubs to screen exercisers for cardiovascular diseases, train their
staff to know CPR and to recognize and respond to cardiac arrest,
establish emergency response plans and conduct cardiac drills.
Studies show clubs are falling behind on these recommendations as
well.</TE>

<HD>Here's Food for Thought About Seeking a Nutritionist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether you want to fine-tune your diet for better health or overhaul
it because of a health condition, finding a good nutritionist takes
work.</LD>
<LD>   Start by asking your doctor for a recommendation or by contacting
the American Dietetic Assn., which maintains lists of practitioners
in your area. Then call the nutritionist and ask about his or her
credentials as well as areas of expertise. Make sure the practitioner
will be able to understand your needs and customize diet advice.</LD>
<LD>   Look for someone who:</LD>
<TE>   * Is either a "registered dietitian," commonly denoted after
someone's name as RD, or has a master's or doctoral degree in
nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   A registered dietitian has earned a bachelor's degree (after
taking courses in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and
statistics), completed a nine- to 12-month internship and passed a
certifying exam.</TE>
<TE>   Among those with advanced degrees in nutrition is the "certified
nutrition specialist," or CNS. A CNS has completed a master's or
doctoral-level nutrition program at an accredited college or
university, done 1,000 hours of supervised work in a specialty and
passed a certification exam by the national certifying body.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in California, your doctor may refer you to a nutritionist
with a master's or doctoral degree in clinical nutrition from an
accredited college or university, regardless of whether that person
is designated a CNS, as long as the doctor deems that person
qualified.</TE>
<TE>   * Incorporates behavior modification and stress reduction and
encourages exercise and good nutrition to improve health.</TE>
<TE>   * Asks about your specific needs and is available to answer your
questions.</TE>
<TE>   * Is willing to work with your doctor.</TE>
<TE>   * Can offer alternatives if a particular plan doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   * Will develop meal plans that include foods tailored to your
lifestyle, needs and medical considerations.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't charge hundreds of dollars for a visit. In the Los Angeles
area, for example, initial consultations may cost around $150;
follow-up visits may run around $80.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To locate a registered dietitian in your area, contact the
American Dietetic Assn. at www.eatright.org or (900) 225-5267.</TE>

<HD>Pineapples: A Sweet Dose of Vitamin C</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the plant world, it's hard to beat a whole fresh pineapple for
drama.</LD>
<LD>   This fruit of a bromeliad has ferocious leaves and an absolutely
prehistoric-looking outer skin. The first person who wanted to see if
this thing was edible must have had a wonderful surprise upon opening
it. Pineapples originated in South America and spread to the
Caribbean, where Columbus found them during a voyage in 1493. The
Spaniards thought they looked like pine cones, and thus the name.
European explorers then carried pineapples to China and the
Philippines.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1800s they were introduced to the Hawaiian islands, where
they are now the principal crop. Today, Florida and Mexico are also
among the major players in the pineapple market.</LD>
<TE>   Nutritionally pineapple is richest in vitamin C, thiamin and
manganese. A cup of pineapple chunks has 76 calories and more than
25% of the RDA for vitamin C.</TE>
<TE>   Pineapple juice, which is very concentrated and almost cloyingly
sweet, has about 130 calories per cup and will give you 50% of your
daily vitamin C requirements. Even though you can get fresh pineapple
year-round, the peak of the season runs from March through June.</TE>
<TE>   Like melons, pineapples don't get any sweeter after harvest, even
though they will get softer and riper if left at room temperature for
a day or two.</TE>
<TE>   Selecting the perfect pineapple has been the subject of myths. It
doesn't help to look at the color, or to thump it, or to pull one of
the leaves to see how easily it comes out.</TE>
<TE>   The most reliable method for selecting the best-tasting pineapple
is to look for a tag or a label that indicates the fruit was
jet-shipped from the grower. Of course, these tend to be more
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Pineapples that have come by boat or truck from Latin or Central
America are often picked when still green, and they may be tough and
not very sweet.</TE>
<TE>   The size of the pineapple doesn't affect the taste much, but the
larger the pineapple, the more edible flesh there will be. It should
feel heavy for its size, the leaves should be green, and it shouldn't
be covered with bruises or soft spots. A good pineapple will smell
like the tropics.</TE>
<TE>   Pineapples, like papayas, contain an enzyme that digests protein.
This is both good and bad news. The good is that by marinating meat
or poultry with fresh pineapple, you can tenderize and flavor it.</TE>
<TE>   However, you can't use fresh pineapple in gelatin molds because
they will never get hard. You also don't want to mix fresh pineapple
with yogurt until just before you serve it because the enzyme
(bromelain) will change the flavor and consistency. Once pineapple
has been heated, the enzyme is deactivated, so canned pineapple will
not have the same effect.</TE>
<TE>   Because preparing fresh pineapple can be labor-intensive, many opt
to buy the fruit in a can or jar. But fresh pineapple is so much
sweeter-tasting that it's well worth the effort. Using a sharp knife,
start by cutting off the crown of leaves. Then slice downward just
under the skin, being careful to follow the round shape of the fruit
so you don't lose a lot of it. Do this all the way around until the
skin is off. Cut it in half, remove the core and slice the remaining
fruit into cubes. Save the top for decorating a tray of fresh fruit.</TE>

<LD>Every now and then, some famous male politician or actor suffers a
fatal heart attack, and a rumor arises: He died having sex.</LD>
<LD>   The idea that having sex can cause a man's heart to conk out was
resurrected, though unintentionally, by a study published last month
in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. Researchers at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., set out to study the safety of the
impotence drug Viagra.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration has compiled 130 reports of men
who died after taking Viagra since it was introduced nearly four
years ago. Many of the men suffered heart attacks or cardiac arrest.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA and American Heart Assn. have stated that Viagra is safe
when used with the proper cautions, but doubts still linger.</TE>
<TE>   So cardiologist Patricia A. Pellikka and her colleagues assembled
105 men who had erectile dysfunction and some form of heart disease.
Each man took a dose of Viagra, then lay on his back and pedaled a
special upside-down cycle. The idea was to make the men exert about
as much effort as they would during sex. The men were also hooked up
to machines that measure heart activity.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment was repeated after giving the men ineffective
medications known as placebos. The result: Researchers found no
difference in how the subjects' hearts responded to the bicycling
exercise while on Viagra or dummy pills.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Mayo Clinic team reported that a majority of the men
experienced a reduction in blood flow to the heart while pedaling the
bike, whether on Viagra or placebo. This condition, known as
ischemia, can rob the heart tissue of oxygen and potentially lead to
a heart attack. Many men who heard about that part of the study--or
perhaps read it--were alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people called and asked 'Does this mean I shouldn't
exercise?'" Pellikka said. "That certainly isn't the message that we
wanted to get across."</TE>
<TE>   As Pellikka explained, ischemia can occur under the stress of
exercise, but usually subsides when you stop exercising. But I'm not
surprised her study shook up some guys, and I suspect many callers
were wondering specifically about exercising during sex.</TE>
<TE>   But don't let folklore about men who died in the saddle spoil your
sex life. Heart attacks do happen in the heat of passion, but they
are rare.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1996 study published in JAMA, a man's risk of
having the Big One increases during the two hours after sexual
activity. For a healthy guy, the risk is about 2.5 times greater than
his relative risk during any other given hour of the day.</TE>
<TE>   For a man who already has some form of cardiac problem, the risk
is 2.9 times greater.</TE>
<TE>   As the authors of the JAMA study point out, however, that is no
big deal. The average man's odds of having a heart attack during any
given hour are extremely low to begin with. So if you increase that
risk by 2.5 or 2.9, you still have a very low risk. In the study,
which analyzed the hospital records of 1,774 men who had heart
attacks, sexual activity was determined to have been a "likely
contributor" in less than 1% of the cases.</TE>
<TE>   By another estimate, says cardiologist Richard Stein, a spokesman
for the American Heart Assn., the odds that a man's heart will stop
due to the rigors of lovemaking during a given year have been
calculated at about one in a million.</TE>
<TE>   That really isn't too surprising. Even if you think you have a
vigorous sex life, you probably aren't placing much stress on your
heart in bed. Scientists have rigged up couples with Holter monitors,
which measure electrical activity in the heart, and asked them to
engage in sex. It turns out that during the act, the average
middle-age guy's heart gets about as good a workout as it would if he
were playing croquet or table tennis. Sexual activity then, says
Stein, who is also chief of cardiology at Brooklyn Hospital Center,
"is a minimal risk."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Stein says all men who have had heart attacks or other
cardiac problems should have a candid conversation with their doctors
about physical activity, including the romantic kind. Stein fears
that these men might steer clear of the bedroom due to myths and
misinformation. Between one-third and one-half of all men who survive
heart attacks or cardiac problems have sex less often than before
their illness, or give up sex altogether, he says.</TE>
<TE>   And that's a shame, since avoiding or limiting sexual activity is
medically necessary for fewer than 10% of cardiac patients. So don't
let irrational fears interfere with your sex life. "It's a fragile
thing in a relationship," Stein said, "and it's easy to damage."</TE>

<LD>THE OXFORD COMPANION TO THE BODY</LD>
<LD>   Edited by Colin Blakemore</LD>
<LD>   and Sheila Jennett</LD>
<TE>   Oxford University Press</TE>
<TE>   752 pages, $55</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overview: A deft interweaving of anatomy and biology with
psychology, anthropology, philosophy, religion, literature, history,
art history and physical science, this compendium is hardly the dry
stuff of typical reference books. Turn to any page and you're likely
to be drawn into an essay on a subject you might not expect to find
in an encyclopedia.</TE>
<TE>   What Works: This dense and fascinating volume offers clear
explanations of every part of the body, explains important
developments in medicine and research, reviews common injuries and
diseases, and provides references for further reading. Many of the
entries include drawings, photographs, reproductions of famous works
of art or anatomical plates. The book begs to be picked up again and
again.</TE>

<HD>A Move Toward Expanded Private Coverage?</HD>

<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Medicare now covering nutritional therapy for some senior
citizens, an expansion of private benefits may not be far behind.</LD>
<LD>   On Jan. 1, the federal program began carrying out a congressional
mandate to provide nutritional benefits to seniors with diabetes or
kidney disease. The change, which potentially could help 5 million
senior citizens, 4.5 million of whom are diabetic, was driven by
evidence compiled by the Institute of Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   The institute, which advises the federal government on medical
issues, found that medical nutrition therapy can help manage and
improve the health of people with diabetes, kidney disease and
cardiovascular conditions such as high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, high triglycerides and heart failure.</LD>
<TE>   Federal health officials, who are supposed to make recommendations
about expanding the program by July 2003, are likely to propose
coverage for nutrition therapy for cardiovascular illnesses as well.</TE>
<TE>   Because private insurers and managed care plans typically take
their cues from Medicare, nutritionists expect that more of their
services will be covered. At this point, nutritional counseling
benefits vary widely among private insurance plans.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna, for example, covers doctor-prescribed nutritional
counseling for its members with diabetes, obesity-related medical
conditions or other chronic diseases that can be improved through
diet.</TE>
<TE>   HealthNet pays for a consultation with a registered dietitian or
certified nutrition specialist when it is deemed "medically
necessary" by the physician and the physician's medical group, said
spokesman Brad Kieffer. Typically, the physician manages the
patient's condition afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Nutritionists in private practice say that most of their clients
must pay for the counseling themselves but that health plans
increasingly recognize the benefits of what they do.</TE>
<TE>   "In an ideal and enlightened world, they would realize it's in
their interest to keep their insured people healthy," said Carolyn
Katzin, a certified nutrition specialist with a private practice on
Los Angeles' Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Although access to nutritional counseling generally is limited to
the insured or those who can afford to pay out of pocket, there are a
few cases in which those without insurance may be able to get
services. For example, around the country there are some programs
being offered in which Medicaid will pay for nutrition care for
children with special needs.</TE>
<TE>   When St. Vincent's Hospital in downtown L.A. opened its Center for
Health and Healing this past week,  it began offering nutritional
counseling not just to its paying patients but also to those without
insurance. The center hopes to attract enough paying clients to
underwrite ongoing services for the uninsured once a two-year grant
from the Sisters of Charity expires, said Carolyn Edwards, a
certified nutrition specialist who serves as a consultant to the
center.</TE>

<HD>Personal Nutrition</HD>
<DH>Trying to eat right is complicated by a maze of guidelines
and advice. A counselor can help, but choosing wisely is crucial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you're looking for a nutritionist, someone to help you feel
better, maybe improve your stamina at the gym or give your diet a
boost? It's easy to end up in the wrong hands.</LD>
<LD>   Virtually anyone can claim the title "nutritionist" in California
because the state doesn't license or certify those who hand out
nutritional or dietary advice. Personal trainers with certificates
from weeklong nutrition courses offer eating tips and dispense
supplements; consultants order saliva and hair tests before
recommending hormone creams for more "vitality"; and herbalists
advise "cleansing" and "detoxifying" formulas. Even doctors and
nurses may tell you what to eat, although they have only cursory
professional training in nutrition.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of people call themselves 'nutritionists.' You have no way
of knowing what kind of background those people have," said Lisa
Gibson, executive director of the California Dietetic Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is particularly complicated in California, a state
known for originating health and fitness crazes and for its variety
of alternative health practitioners. Although 42 states and the
District of Columbia require either state licensing or state
certification of dietitians or nutritionists to help protect the
public from potential harm, California requires only that dietitians
alone be registered with their professional organization. (Licensing
and certification is pending in three of the remaining seven states;
four do nothing.) The state does not define the term "nutritionist"
or specify who may hand out dietary advice.</TE>
<TE>   That essentially leaves it up to the consumer to choose wisely.
Pick the wrong person and you could be endangering your health, not
to mention wasting your money.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals with serious medical problems may delay or
discontinue appropriate medical treatment if they follow advice from
someone who claims to be a nutritionist without appropriate education
and training," said Leigh-Anne Rice, chairwoman of the Consumer
Protection Committee of the California Dietetic Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson cited as an example a Southern California woman with a
precancerous growth in her colon who went to a nutritional consultant
last spring for alternative treatment. When the patient told the
consultant that the recommended colon-cleansing diet was causing
rectal bleeding, the consultant said that was a sign she was healing.
The consultant then proceeded to put her on a gallbladder cleansing
regimen that produced a potentially lethal muscle condition.</TE>
<TE>   The woman later recovered from that condition and filed a report
with the California Dietetic Assn., which tries to monitor
questionable and unethical practices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Health and Nutrition Claims Abound</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans think that if only we change what we put in our
mouths, we can enjoy better health and longer life. Little wonder.
We're bombarded by health and nutrition claims and counterclaims in
magazines, bestselling books, newspapers and television infomercials.
We hear about new studies demonstrating how certain foods improve one
condition, only to be told later that they may increase the risk of
another illness.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is having an effect. The most recent biennial survey
of the American Dietary Assn. shows that as of late 1999, 28% of
those surveyed said they'd made significant changes in their eating
behavior to be more healthy, up 2% since 1997. At the same time, the
number of people who said healthful eating isn't a concern dropped
from 40% in 1997 to 32%, and the "I know I should do better" types
increased from 34% in 1997 to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Americans are fatter than ever and being diagnosed
increasingly with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, both
of which can be mitigated by lifestyle improvements.</TE>
<TE>   To steer our way through the thicket of materials--and the
conflict between what we know and what we actually do--we
increasingly look to experts whose job it is to stay on top of the
information.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember that nutrition is evolutionary, not
revolutionary, and therefore we must be open-minded to new
information that comes our way," said Roxanne Moore, a spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the uncertainties, the state of nutritional science today
is better than it's ever been, with a firmer understanding of how
overeating, especially gorging on high-fat foods, can clog arteries,
promote certain types of cancers and shorten our lives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nutrition Professionals Fall Into Two Categories</TE>
<TE>   Only a few diet professionals are trained and qualified to sort
food fact from fiction, weigh unique medical problems, genetic
predispositions and behavioral patterns, and devise a way to break
through bad eating habits. Although they may have specialties as
diverse as herbal medicine, sports nutrition, cardiac heath and
eating disorders, they fall into two basic categories:</TE>
<TE>   * Registered dietitians who have earned a four-year degree (after
taking courses in the basic sciences, food sciences and behavior
sciences), have logged experience in the field and have passed a
professional exam of the Commission on Dietetic Registration, a
credentialing agency technically separate from the American Dietetic
Assn. They also have continuing education requirements.</TE>
<TE>   * Nutritionists who have earned master's or doctoral degrees in
nutrition. Some of them, called certified nutrition specialists, have
passed an exam of the American College of Nutrition's Certification
Board for Nutrition Specialists and stay current with continuing
education credits.</TE>
<TE>   Such professionals commonly provide dietary advice, or what is
called medical nutrition therapy, to treat such conditions as
diabetes, obesity and heart disease with dietary changes. However,
California law states that only a registered dietitian or a
nutritional professional who has a master's or higher degree in
clinical nutrition from a nationally accredited college and is deemed
qualified by a referring doctor may treat medical conditions through
diet. Although the law doesn't provide specific penalties or
sanctions for violators, they can be prosecuted for practicing
medicine without a license.</TE>
<TE>   Often those looking for nutritional advice don't land in the hands
of trained professionals until after other nutrition consultants have
failed or made things worse.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen McMullen, a sales planning manager from Yorba Linda,
endured two miserable years with stomach problems and fatigue that
digestive specialists attributed to colitis, Crohn's disease,
irritable bowel syndrome and finally something "in her head." After
only getting worse on antidepressants and a high-fiber diet, she
asked her regular doctor to find her a nutritionist. Last July,
before recommending any dietary changes, Evelyn Tribole, a registered
dietitian and author of several popular books, suggested that
McMullen's doctor test her for celiac disease, a disorder that makes
sufferers unable to digest any grains except corn and rice.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo. The fiber prescribed by a gastroenterologist, who
specializes in diseases of the gut, was only making things worse.</TE>
<TE>   Tribole introduced McMullen, a 39-year-old mother of two, to foods
she could tolerate (she settles for tortilla chips and rice cakes and
looks longingly at the bread and pasta her kids eat) and advised her
on meal plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Three days after I started that diet, I felt better. I have my
energy back," said McMullen, who has begun jogging again after months
off her regular exercise program.</TE>
<TE>   Although certain conditions such as kidney disease, diabetes and
some types of heart disease indisputably improve with dietary
changes, as can athletic performance, many folks in generally good
health can use nutritional counseling to help prevent disease later
on.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that anyone can benefit from fine-tuning their diet and
seeing a nutrition professional, because many of the diseases they're
going to face in 20 or 30 years are slow, progressive, gradual kinds
of conditions," said Penelope Edwards, a certified nutrition
specialist from the San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Often nutritionists can design more healthful plans, sort out
conflicting dietary advice and offer behavioral support to help make
the changes stick. That's what helped David Barnes, a former
professional football player who became discouraged after he was
still packing 290 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame after a decade of
failed diets.</TE>
<TE>   "You go through all the diets, read all the books, do all the
stuff, and at the end of the day it doesn't work," said Barnes, whose
jobs with manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs and supplements
have inured him to quick-fix advertising claims. In late January,
after looking for a credentialed nutritionist who "knows the human
body as well as nutrition," he found Tribole. She helped him cut out
meat, consume five fruits and vegetables daily and, more important,
change his focus.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about how I felt, as opposed to counting calories,"
said Barnes, 49. In his first month working with Tribole, he has
dropped 8 pounds and has more energy.</TE>
<TE>   Though Tribole works with Barnes in person and over the phone on
an ongoing basis, acting like a food therapist, some clients prefer
just a consultation to get them started on a new path.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Diet Specialist May Scan Client's Pantry, Fridge</TE>
<TE>   Most nutritional counseling begins with a basic medical and food
history; some may include additional physical evaluation such as
measurements of body fat.</TE>
<TE>   "I use a body composition analysis machine that evaluates the
amount of lean body mass and fat," said Carolyn Katzin, a certified
nutrition specialist who practices on Los Angeles' Westside. From
there she calculates how many calories clients burn daily and what it
would take for them to drop pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes she makes home visits, going through the contents of a
client's pantry and refrigerator, reviewing the labels of the foods
he or she typically buys, suggesting more healthful items as
substitutes.</TE>
<TE>   What the counseling should not include, most experts agree, is
reliance on hair analysis or supplements.</TE>
<TE>   Although nutritionists occasionally suggest supplements,
"reputable registered dietitians don't sell vitamins and
supplements," said Keith Ayoob, a nutritionist at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York. "It's not ethical to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Roxanne Moore, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Assn., said, "If you go to somebody that's doing
hair analysis, usually what they're looking to do is sell something
to you." Often clients will be told that supplements will give them
more energy or muscle strength, she said. But besides spending money
needlessly, Moore added, "you run the risk of being told to do
something contradicted by your medical background."</TE>
<TE>   Most dietary advice should focus on behavior changes and more
sensible eating, credentialed nutritionists agree. "There's so much
you know about biochemistry, digestion, aging processes, that the
average consumer doesn't know," Katzin said. "They go into a store
and are told something is going to make them young and virile. It's
fairy dust."</TE>

<LD>Question: Sometimes after I exercise, my lower back begins to hurt.
I'm not pushing it with my workouts (I walk/run four days a week for
30 to 45 minutes each time). Any thoughts on the cause?</LD>
<LD>   STEVEN SOLOMON</LD>
<LD>   Studio City</LD>
<TE>   Answer: If your back hurts after your workout, don't assume your
workout is the reason. Many exercisers suffer back pain after
workouts because they collapse in a slouched position while
recuperating.</TE>
<TE>   Robin McKenzie, a physical therapist and author of "Treat Your Own
Back," suggests that you ask whether your pain begins during or after
exercise. If the answer is after, consider whether your
after-exercise posture is poor. Tight muscles could be the cause of
the pain. If your answer is during, the workout may indeed be the
culprit.</TE>
<TE>   To relieve common back pain, try this back extension to make sure
your muscles are strong and adequately stretched:</TE>
<TE>   Lie on your stomach with your forehead on the floor, arms straight
out in front of you, palms down, and legs straight out behind you.
Pull your abs in, as if you're trying to create a small space between
your stomach and the floor. Next, lift your right arm and left leg
about one inch off the floor and stretch out as much as you can. Hold
this position for five slow counts, then lower. Repeat the same move
with your left arm and right leg. Continue alternating sides until
you've completed 10 on each side.</TE>
<TE>   To stretch your back and hamstring muscles, try this seated
forward bend (but make sure you warm up beforehand for this one):</TE>
<TE>   Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you and with
the knees straight. Lift your arms over your head and stretch your
spine upward. Slowly bend forward with your pelvis initiating the
movement so the spine stays slightly arched and the knees remain
straight. Place your arms by your sides to support your back.
Gradually lower your upper body toward your thighs. Make sure the
spine is as long as possible and the pelvis is rolling forward, the
sitting bones back. Hold for five to 10 seconds, then use your arms
to help you come back up to a seated position.</TE>
<TE>   Strong abdominal muscles can help reduce back trouble, so don't
neglect your abs.</TE>

<HD>Chronic Headaches Can Cause Psychological Problems in Kids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"My head hurts." Like many parents, we occasionally hear this
complaint from our children. We offer our sympathy, a beverage, a
snack, a comfortable place to rest, and--sometimes--a child's dose of
acetaminophen. Almost always, the symptoms quickly pass.</LD>
<LD>   About 60% of all school-age children have had a headache. For
these children, the conservative "treatment" described above is the
best approach. But about 20% of children suffer from frequent
headaches, from a few times a month to every day. For them, the
headaches can cause not only severe pain, but also missed school days
and significant social and psychological problems.</LD>
<LD>   In such instances, a casual approach is not appropriate; an
accurate diagnosis is essential to treat recurrent headaches and
prevent future ones.</LD>
<TE>   The two most common types of chronic or recurrent headaches are
the same as those experienced most frequently by adults: migraine and
tension headaches. They differ significantly in what causes them and
in the way they should be treated.</TE>
<TE>   There are two forms of migraine headaches. The "classic" migraine
(or migraine with an aura) is preceded by a warning period, during
which a child may complain of visual disturbances, such as blind
spots or flashing lights, or unusual sensations of smell or touch.
The other form of migraine, migraine without aura, is not associated
with these warning symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Debilitating Affect of Migraines</TE>
<TE>   In all other ways, the two forms of migraine are quite similar.
The pain is typically described as "pounding" or "throbbing " and can
last anywhere from one hour to two days.</TE>
<TE>   The pain of a migraine headache is so severe that 50% of children
cry during a migraine attack, and more than 95% are forced to lie
down and withdraw from their normal activities. Although the pain
usually involves only one side of the head, it can (particularly in
children) affect both. During a migraine attack, a child may be
extremely sensitive to light or sound and may complain of abdominal
pain or nausea.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of migraine headaches is not fully understood but may be
related to temporary changes in blood flow within the brain.
Imbalances in certain brain chemicals, particularly serotonin, are
likely responsible for producing these changes.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of things can trigger the reaction that leads to a
migraine headache, including stress and other psychological factors.
For example, in children, anxiety about an impending school
examination or excitement over a social event or athletic competition
can set one off.</TE>
<TE>   More tangible factors, such as loud noise, bright light, strong
odors or extreme temperatures are also known to trigger migraines.
Missing a meal, not getting enough sleep, getting too much sleep and
a sudden increase in physical activity have also been implicated.</TE>
<TE>   In some children, specific foods can be responsible. (Kid-friendly
foods that can be problematic include chocolate, yogurt, nuts, citrus
fruits and bananas, pizza, smoked and processed meats such as
bologna, pepperoni and hot dogs.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nature of Tension Headaches</TE>
<TE>   A tension headache tends to be less severe than a migraine but can
be just as disruptive to a child's life. The pain, which typically
affects both sides of the head, is often described as a "steady
ache."</TE>
<TE>   The muscles of the face, scalp and neck contract causing head and
neck pain. In most children with tension headaches, the episodes
occur relatively infrequently and with no particular pattern.
However, some youngsters can experience this type of headache on a
regular (even daily) basis.</TE>
<TE>   Just as for adults, emotional factors play a major role in the
development of tension headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Any problem--whether at school or at home--can create stress that
causes the muscles of the head and neck to tighten up, leading to
pain.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to note that recurrent headaches in children can
also be caused by simple things such as poor eyesight (usually cured
by eyeglasses) and occasionally by such serious medical problems as
brain tumors and meningitis.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, any child who has recurrent headaches--or even a
single severe headache that does not resolve after treatment with
simple analgesics--should be evaluated by a physician.</TE>
<TE>   Determining the cause of chronic headaches in children usually
does not require complicated or expensive testing.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the diagnosis can be made with only a detailed medical
history and a thorough physical examination. If any nervous system
abnormalities are found during the exam, or if the child's history
suggests that an underlying medical problem may be responsible for
the headaches (for example, a history of seizures or "blackouts"),
the doctor will order more elaborate tests to determine the cause.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To Prevent Pain, Avoid Triggers</TE>
<TE>   The best way to prevent headaches is to avoid the things that
trigger their start. However, that can be harder to do than it
sounds. Triggers differ from child to child, and sometimes it's
difficult to pinpoint the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents find it helpful to keep a headache diary for a few
weeks, documenting all of their child's headaches along with any
physical, dietary or psychological factors that may have set them
off.</TE>
<TE>   Simply maintaining a regular schedule at home can often be helpful
in reducing the frequency of headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Select a reasonable bedtime and stick to it to assure that the
child gets enough sleep; establish a set schedule for meals and
snacks to prevent the child from going too long without food. Develop
a homework routine to avoid stress, and keep extracurricular
activities in check to allow for down time.</TE>
<TE>   If prevention strategies don't eliminate the headaches,
medications may be needed to control the pain and permit the children
to do the things they normally do. The type of medication will depend
on the type of headache and the degree of pain.</TE>
<TE>   Although jokes abound about the way adults use headaches to escape
unwanted tasks, it's important that parents not jump to the
conclusion that their child is using them this way.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the symptoms are real and should be treated with
the same seriousness and sympathy that any other chronic illness
would receive.</TE>

<HD>Take a Deep Breath, Yoga Ad Was a Joke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The outrage begins with the full-page advertisement on page 11 of
Yoga Journal's April issue.</LD>
<LD>   "Invitational. Yoga Pose Off. $30,000 First Prize!" Then in
smaller print: "Watch the world's best as they battle for prestige
and cash!"</LD>
<LD>   Below are mugs of several grunge-type characters who look like
competitors from the X Games,  including: Cedar, "2001 Vancouver Yoga
Instructor of the Year"; Tara-Lynn Williams, "West Coast Power Yoga
Regional Champion"; and "Ananda Kumar, owner and founder of Kumar's
Kundalini Kiva."</LD>
<TE>   To many, the ad is an affront to a yogic philosophy that preaches
self-acceptance and spiritual transformation, and discourages
competition and judgment. But to some enthusiasts, who take pride in
their ability to perform pretzel-like poses that leave yoga
classmates in awe, the idea of taking home a $30,000 prize was rather
enticing.</TE>
<TE>   A surprise awaited at the Web site where readers of the ad were
directed for contest information. "The pose off is an April Fools'
joke,'' said the site, sponsored by Lululemon Athletica, a Vancouver,
B.C., fitness firm. "It does not exist. Be one with your sense of
humor."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, most readers never got as far as the Web site.
Instead, upon seeing the ad, some readers apparently became so
incensed that they either had to work through their anger privately
with pranayama breathing or by sending letters to the editors of Yoga
Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can think of nothing more opposed to the purpose of yoga than
asana competition for monetary prizes," wrote one "appalled"
subscriber to Yoga Journal. "The idea of a pose-off is anathema to
yoga," wrote another impassioned subscriber. "Instead of a pose-off,
why not support an asana-thon, where students are encouraged to take
as much time as possible getting into the postures?" Said another:
"What's scary is that the idea is not beyond believability."</TE>
<TE>   Chip Wilson, founder and chief executive of Lululemon Athletica,
which manufactures clothing for specialized sports, including yoga,
is unfazed by the negative reactions. "Certain kinds of people who
take on these sports adopt them like religion," said Wilson, 46, who
was born in Los Angeles, and grew up in California's
surf/skate/snowboard culture. "They are feeling empty and void and
someone knocks on the door. It could be a marathon runner or a surfer
or a yogi, but it is something that fulfills that person. They begin
to lose perspective on what the snowboarding or surfing or yoga is
all about.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked around, and I started seeing the fanatics getting into
it [yoga] and I thought, 'Something isn't right here.'"</TE>
<TE>   He decided to inject some levity into what he perceived as a
community that takes itself too seriously. Initially, Wilson tried to
recruit local yoga teachers as the phony contestants, but they
refused, worried about their reputations. So he made up his own
contestants: Ananda Kumar is Wilson; Tara-Lynn Williams is his wife.
The others are employees. When Wilson purchased the $15,000,
full-page color ad in Yoga Journal, he told only the saleswoman about
the joke. The journal's editors were out of the loop, and unprepared
for the firestorm  the ad provoked.</TE>
<TE>   "Our readers are not happy about it at all," said Managing Editor
Nora Isaacs, who has received dozens of calls and letters about the
Pose Off. "Readers didn't know it was a joke. They are saying, 'You
are going down the drain. How could you do this?'"</TE>
<TE>   Isaacs said the magazine did not check the validity of the ad
because yoga competitions are a long-standing tradition in India,
where yoga originated 5,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yoga Journal will print a letter from a reader, along with
Wilson's response and explanation, in its May/June issue.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Wilson is already plotting next year's April Fools'
joke. "It's going to be an ad for a men's yoga thong," he said.</TE>

<HD>Feathered Dinosaur's Fossil Reported Found</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paleontologists working in China have unearthed the first fossil of a
dinosaur that appears to have had full-fledged feathers--a finding
they say settles once and for all the debate over whether dinosaurs
and birds are related. The team from the American Museum of Natural
History in New York City said the 3-foot fossil also reinforces the
idea that at least some dinosaurs were warm-blooded creatures that
needed feathers for insulation.</LD>
<LD>   The specimen, reported in the March 7 edition of Nature, is
believed to be about 128 million years old. It is a small,
fleet-footed theropod, a two-legged carnivore that could not fly and
belongs to the same family as the larger and more fearsome
Tyrannosaurus rex. The researchers said the dinosaur appears to have
had mature feathers identical to those of modern birds, including
long, showy plumage on its tail and hind legs.</LD>

<LD>Researchers have found evidence that stem cells circulating in the
bloodstream can grow new tissue in the liver, gut and skin.</LD>
<LD>   Stem cells found in the bone marrow were once believed to make
only new blood cells. But recent studies have upset that dogma,
finding that they apparently develop into a variety of cells
throughout the body.</LD>
<LD>   Stem cells in the blood are virtually identical to the bone marrow
variety. The new study in the March 7 edition of the New England
Journal of Medicine suggests that they, too, can morph into many
different kinds of tissue.</LD>

<DH>Biology: Restocking rivers with dead salmon--a food source
for some creatures-- may aid ecosystems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a typically gray, gloomy day last November in Oregon, the skies
opened over the Mt. Hood National Forest and it began to rain fish.</LD>
<LD>   Over two days, about 70,000 pounds of coho salmon fell, courtesy
of a bucket-like device dangling beneath a large helicopter. Upon
impact--the splashes could be heard from half a mile away--most of
the fish went belly up and lodged behind rocks and downed logs.
Others were swept away in the current, to become a meal for wildlife
residing near branches of the Clackamas or Sandy rivers, the targets
of this strange exercise in salmon restoration.</LD>
<LD>   The thousands of fish that fell those two days were dead long
before the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest
Service deposited them into the rivers. The agencies had initiated
the carcass drop--using excess fish taken from hatcheries--because of
a growing body of scientific evidence showing that dead salmon are
precisely what's missing from many river ecosystems in the Pacific
Northwest.</LD>
<TE>   The thinking goes like this: Before Europeans settled the region,
tens of millions of salmon migrated from the ocean each year to spawn
and then die in the same rivers where they were born. Some of the
fish were caught by the region's Native Americans, but millions
simply perished in the rivers, where the decaying bodies turned into
a feast for insects, eagles and, perhaps surprisingly, young salmon.</TE>
<TE>   To put it in more human terms, the final gift that adult salmon
gave their kids was an easy meal.</TE>
<TE>   Today, human activities--including dam building, logging and
hatcheries that dilute the genetics of wild stocks--have greatly
reduced salmon numbers, and many of the historic runs are endangered.
What scientists now want to know is how the removal of that
once-abundant food source has altered river ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first researchers to focus on the role of dead salmon
in river ecosystems was Mark Wipfli, who went to Alaska in 1992,
fresh out of graduate school, to be an ecologist with the forest
service.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first arrived in Alaska, I noticed the streams didn't seem
to have a lot of aquatic insects, but they produced so many young
salmon," says Wipfli. "There were a lot of salmon coming out of these
systems, but not a lot of food. Both myself and some others began
thinking there was something going on in those streams that wasn't
obvious."</TE>
<TE>   Wipfli and his colleagues soon began canvassing streams, and found
that waters with salmon carcasses usually had more insects, higher
levels of nutrients and young salmon that grew faster and bigger than
in streams without salmon runs. About the same time, other
researchers in the U.S. and Canada were reaching similar conclusions:
Decomposing salmon appeared to be the foundation for the region's
aquatic ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   One researcher found at least 138 wildlife species that had some
type of relationship with salmon, including 32 mammals and 38 birds.
Bald eagles, bears, raccoons, minks, otters--to name just a few--fed
directly on the carcasses. Many other creatures seemed to enjoy
indirect benefits. A small bird called the American dipper, for
example, profited from the increased population of insects.</TE>
<TE>   Dead salmon aren't so much at the bottom of the food chain as at
the center of a complex food web that extends from river bottoms to
forests far from the water's edge, researchers are learning. Birds,
mammals and insects pass nutrients into the soil, benefiting
streamside vegetation. Such plants, in turn, help salmon by providing
shade and dropping leaves and needles into rivers, providing even
more food for insects.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fully Understanding the Impact Could Take Years</TE>
<TE>   But fully understanding the many impacts that salmon have on
ecosystems will take years, perhaps decades, researchers say. One way
to test the effect of carcasses is to reintroduce live salmon into a
river where they once spawned but are now absent. That could occur in
a few years in Washington's Olympic National Park. The Elwha River
spills from the park's high country into western Puget Sound. But two
dams on the river, one built in 1912 and the other in 1927, block
migrating salmon from reaching the upper 67 miles of the Elwha.</TE>
<TE>   Before the dams were built, all five species of salmon native to
the Pacific Northwest inhabited the river, including chinooks that
occasionally reached 100 pounds. If funding from Congress comes
through, the dams could be removed by 2005, which may enable nearly
400,000 salmon to one day return to the river.</TE>
<TE>   "We call the Upper Elwha largely pristine because the habitat is
still intact," says Brian Winter, head of the Elwha restoration
project for the park service. "But the fish aren't there, and all the
nutrients that were historically there and taken up by riparian
vegetation and wildlife aren't there. For visitors to the park's back
country, the Elwha might look pristine. But it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   That may change if the dams come down. Some of those fish will be
harvested by tribes and anglers. But most, says Winter, will be
allowed to do what salmon have done for thousands of years--spawn,
die and become a meal for other wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Restocking and Monitoring the Results</TE>
<TE>   Until that happens, the best way to determine the salmon's role in
ecosystems is to restock the carcasses that human activities have
removed from rivers and then stand back and monitor the results.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a one-time thing," says Dan Shively, a fisheries
biologist for Mt. Hood National Forest. "We plan to keep doing this
as long as fish keep coming back from the ocean. And a program like
this was received very favorably by the public, as long as we paid
attention to some water-quality issues and avoided dropping salmon in
people's backyards."</TE>

<HD>Comedian Colin Quinn Goes Solo</HD>
<DH>Television * NBC has scheduled a three- episode run for a
show starring the former 'SNL' cast member.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colin Quinn is not the best salesman for his own show. But then, "The
Colin Quinn Show" doesn't fit neatly into any prime-time category,
and it's only supposed to air for three weeks, a comedy interlude in
a long television season.</LD>
<LD>   "What Zucker said to me, I don't think you get to hear too often,"
Quinn said, referring to NBC programming chief Jeff Zucker. "He said,
'Col, do what you want. We know that this is an experiment. It's
something to try.' He didn't even say 'succeed.' He said 'try.'"</LD>
<LD>   That seems to suit the former "Saturday Night Live" cast member
just fine. Quinn's show, to be taped live in New York for broadcast
at 9:30 tonight and the next two Mondays, will attempt to effect the
loose, topical feel of "Laugh-In," Quinn said, using formats familiar
to viewers (stand-up, sketches, short films) while trying not to be
too rigidly formulaic.</LD>
<TE>   He'd rather the sketches play like scenes, like something written
by Paddy Chayefsky. And he wants the show to confront the events of
the week.</TE>
<TE>   "'Laugh-In,' believe it or not, they did deal with the week's
[news] content. They may have done it in an absurd way, but they
definitely dealt with the content of the week," Quinn noted.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Quinn has this lofty way of summing up his show's
worldview: "To me--and I'm not ashamed to say this, [though] I should
be--it's kind of like a meditation on contemporary culture."</TE>
<TE>   "The Colin Quinn Show" will premiere sandwiched between a
90-minute celebrity edition of "Fear Factor" and the tribute special
"Saturday Night Live Remembers John Belushi." Its three-episode run
is part of an overall scheduling strategy at NBC to avoid airing
reruns of its dramatic series between now and May.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn isn't thinking much beyond that plateau, saying the show
probably won't deserve to go further "if I can't pop this thing in
three episodes."</TE>
<TE>   When Quinn left "SNL" in 2000 ("I was like Ricky Martin when he
left Menudo," Quinn said. "Frighteningly like Ricky Martin. I mean
that with all the implications"), he returned to performing stand-up
comedy almost nightly and worked on screenplays.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Quinn's own work is a reflection of his middle-class Irish
upbringing in Brooklyn. In 1998, his one-man show "Colin Quinn: An
Irish Wake," featuring the voices of his family and neighborhood,
made its Broadway premiere, after Quinn performed earlier
incarnations of the show in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The Colin Quinn Show" is being produced by "SNL" founder Lorne
Michaels and getting a hand from a host of other "SNL" staff,
including producer Michael Shoemaker and writer-performer Tina Fey.
Former "SNL" cast member Cheri Oteri appears on the first episode.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Quinn doesn't want the show to bear too close a
resemblance to the "Saturday Night" franchise. "That's the whole
challenge ... to try to keep it from being too 'SNL'-y," he said.</TE>

<LD>CBS took over management of the UPN network in January, and some of
the first tangible evidence of that relationship shows up this week.</LD>
<LD>   This Friday at 8 p.m., UPN will televise back-to-back episodes of
"The Amazing Race 2," repeating installments of the CBS series that
will have been broadcast on the parent network tonight and Wednesday.
Each Friday thereafter, encores of "Amazing Race 2" will be paired on
UPN with "Under One Roof" --a new so-called "reality" series
featuring families competing for a beachfront home.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, "The March to Madness," the first special produced by
CBS for UPN, will be broadcast March 27, days before the NCAA
basketball championship Final Four, which airs, of course, on CBS.</LD>
<TE>   Though officials at the two networks, which are both owned by
Viacom, have stressed that they don't intend to turn UPN into CBS
Jr., additional cross-pollination between the networks is being
discussed. UPN will also begin televising episodes of the short-lived
CBS series "Wolf Lake," starring Lou Diamond Phillips, in April.</TE>

<HD>Fallout Beyond 'Nightline'</HD>
<DH>The rest of ABC's news division could suffer if Koppel's
show is indeed replaced with David Letterman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The watershed moment for network news--when it was put on notice that
budget concerns, not just public service, would henceforth be a
priority--came in 1987 courtesy of CBS Chairman Larry Tisch. At the
time, employees were blindsided by a report that Tisch planned a
major reduction at the network's news division. Tisch ultimately cut
10% of its $300-million budget and a sixth of its 1,220 jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Echoes of 1987 reverberated through the recent revelation that ABC
and parent Walt Disney Co. had been plotting to replace Ted Koppel's
"Nightline" with comedian David Letterman. "[It's] even worse," said
Alex Jones, director of Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on
the Press.</LD>
<LD>   The vulnerability of "Nightline," one of television news' most
honored programs, has spurred an outpouring of support, from ABC's
Barbara Walters to CBS' Dan Rather to 10,000 viewer e-mails,
petitions and a "Save Nightline" Web site. As the initial shock
fades, however, industry executives have been trying to decipher
what, if anything, the change portends for network news.</LD>
<TE>   Disney's attack on "Nightline" is just the latest indignity for
critics already bemoaning the declining state of TV journalism. They
cite shrinking foreign bureaus, increasing hype and entertainment
packaging, and obsession with celebrity to boost ratings, with actor
Leonardo DiCaprio's interview of President Clinton for ABC News
representing a particular low point. The trend of news divisions
being subsumed by ever-bigger entertainment giants with other
priorities is unlikely to slow with a new wave of media consolidation
imminent in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry trenches counter that network news has
adapted to new budget realities and, as NBC News proves, can be
highly profitable. The "Nightline" situation, they argue, is
distressing for the callous way ABC handled it. But it is only
indicative of the difficult economic state of Disney, a financial
opportunity in Letterman that the company would be irresponsible not
to pursue, and a reflection on Koppel himself, who has cut back
on-air hours in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The one thing everyone agrees is that the incident reinforces the
message that profitability matters and will increase the pressure for
CBS or ABC to make a long-discussed deal with cable's CNN to share
news-gathering costs. So far, talks have languished because neither
side is willing to cede control, with network executives insisting
CNN-style news is shallow.</TE>
<TE>   If "Nightline" goes away, it will have broad financial
implications for ABC News far more damaging than the symbolic ones.
Every program at ABC News has to absorb overhead costs for the entire
operation, and other programs such as "Good Morning America" and
"World News Tonight" will have to pick up the "Nightline" slack.</TE>
<TE>   "The loss of air time will cause more difficulties for the
division," said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst for the investment
research firm Sanford C. Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   In the critics' camp, senior National Public Radio correspondents
in a letter to the editor, called "Nightline" a "beacon of
intelligent information in a TV landscape marked by increasing
irrelevancies," adding that anonymous Disney remarks about the show's
irrelevancy were "a sorry commentary on the vulnerability of serious
broadcast journalism."</TE>
<TE>   Disney President Robert Iger has said those sentiments don't
reflect the company's feelings. Still Disney's willingness to trade
away "Nightline's" cachet so painlessly suggests the possibility of a
ripple effect to those already decrying the erosion of TV news. "It
would have seemed inconceivable that one of the three networks would
take on one of the genuinely marquee news programs ... and simply
give it a swift kick," says Jones. "That suggests that the future of
network news is very much in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   And former NBC News President Reuven Frank, in a commentary for
USA Today similarly predicted that the demise of "Nightline," if it
comes, will be the first in a string of disappearing programs, with
the dinner-hour newscasts "in their last days."</TE>
<TE>   So is the sky falling? Well before the "Nightline" imbroglio, the
evening newscasts were hurting, as local stations grabbed pre-prime
time hours for more lucrative game and entertainment shows pushing
the network evening newscasts earlier. In the Central time zone,
network news airs at 5:30 p.m., all but ensuring that the young
working professionals advertisers covet won't be home to watch.</TE>
<TE>   The anchors have been aging along with their audiences: Dan Rather
is 70; Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings are in their 60s. Few potential
successors have the same breadth of experience and stature, which
leads many to conclude that when this generation of network news
anchors retires, the shows will be reconfigured or dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, said one senior industry executive, who insisted the
nightly news will be around for a long time to come, its value
enhanced after the events of Sept. 11, when news-hungry viewers tuned
in.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the audience erosion of the 1990s has largely stopped,
said another, Paul Slavin, executive producer of ABC's "World News
Tonight." He noted that during the week of Feb. 25, more than 30
million people tuned in on average to the three networks' evening
newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't feel irrelevant to me; it doesn't feel like
something dying to me. As long as people are voting with their
fingertips and remotes, we'll exist," Slavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at competing networks said they have already adapted to
being smaller divisions of profit-pressured conglomerates. At General
Electric-owned NBC, one executive noted that although Katie Couric
will earn $65 million over four years under her new deal with
"Today," she is on air more than 10 hours per week, gets recycled on
MSNBC, and reports for "Dateline."</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC has inoculated NBC News from drastic reductions, said
another senior executive there. Although the cable news channel, a
joint venture with Microsoft, loses money, NBC News uses it to
amortize millions in costs, asking correspondents in Afghanistan,
say, to file around the clock on MSNBC as well as for "Nightly News."</TE>
<TE>   Though CBS doesn't have a cable news channel, the network, more so
than ABC, has also found ways to amortize its expensive news
infrastructure by spreading programming around. There's a
co-production for "BET Nightly News," projects for MTV and VH-1,
perhaps even future news shows for UPN. All those networks, like CBS,
are units of Viacom. CBS News, in fact, now has more employees than
before the Tisch-mandated cuts, although fewer cover hard news.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves ABC News in a category by itself. Still suffering from
when Roone Arledge ran the division and put together an esteemed but
expensive talent roster, ABC News already eliminated 125 jobs last
year, and dozens of employees have taken pay cuts of up to 25%. Right
after Disney bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, the company scrapped
plans to launch its own all-news cable channel after Fox and NBC
embarked on their own efforts, saying the start-up costs were too
high.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, that may have left ABC vulnerable. More recently,
said media analyst Wolzien, it was a failure to invest in
entertainment shows to eventually replace the quiz hit "Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire" that has led to prime-time problems in a down
economy. "If the network were doing well, odds are there wouldn't be
as much profitability pressure" in late night, which drove the bid
for Letterman, he said. ABC is "reaping what was sown or not sown
strategically."</TE>

<DH>A powerful temporary memorial to Sept. 11 offers lessons
for those planning a permanent marker.</DH>

<LD>Tonight at sundown in New York, if all goes as planned, twin columns
of light will rise high into the sky above lower Manhattan. The
six-month anniversary of the terrorist attack on the World Trade
Center will be marked by a side-by-side pair of light beams, each
composed of 44 searchlights arranged in a square configuration.
Located at Battery Park City, just west of ground zero--a location
built on landfill produced in the 1960s by construction of the
mammoth trade center towers--the columns of light will shine every
night until 11 p.m. through April 13.</LD>
<LD>   A huge sense of anticipation greets their debut. Partly it's a
result of anxiety. "Tribute of Light," as the temporary memorial to
the tragedy of Sept. 11 is called, offers the first real inkling of
what an official, permanent remembrance of the awful event might be.
The complex question of a permanent memorial looms large. "Tribute of
Light" is an avatar of the long, stressful road that lies ahead in
determining what shape that memorial might take.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the anticipation also seems born of optimism. "Tribute of
Light" is that rare public art project that, when announced,
immediately captured the popular imagination. It just seemed--right.
Its cause was taken up at once, in press accounts and magazine
stories. Dozens, even scores of other proposals for memorial projects
have been floated in the aftermath of the towers' collapse. "Tribute
of Light" is the one that always seemed inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The twin columns obviously are intended to be a ghost version of
the Trade Center towers. The behemoths are recalled as a kind of
fragile memory--not in the cold, tangible stuff of steel and glass,
but in the spiritually inflected substance of ethereal light. The
work elaborates--on a monumental scale that befits the enormity of
what happened--at least two familiar metaphors. Electrified, it is an
industrial-strength votive candle or eternal flame, which burns in
remembrance of the past and as a wish for peaceful rest. Composed
from searchlights pointed skyward, it also shines as a beacon of hope
for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Tribute of Light" was designed by a team of six architects and
artists: John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi of PROUN Space Studio;
artists Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda; architect Richard Gould,
and lighting designer Paul Marantz. With the assistance of the
Battery Park City Authority, it is supported by two of New York's
most venerable nonprofit cultural organizations: the Municipal Art
Society and Creative Time.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, the design was conceived Sept. 12, just a day after
the terrorist assault. It has evolved and been refined since then,
but the general idea has remained unchanged. Conceived under
conditions of unspeakable chaos, horror and alarm, the light
sculpture also emerged as a monument to the power of focused artistic
thought.</TE>
<TE>   That's why tonight's "Tribute of Light" may hold an important clue
about how to proceed with the terribly fraught task of creating a
permanent monument. For if the idea of a light projection immediately
captured the public imagination, a fitting permanent memorial still
seems almost impossible to imagine.</TE>
<TE>   As a reporter for the Wall Street Journal wrote not long ago,
years from now, when a memorial to the tragedy of Sept. 11 does rise
from the rubble, one thing is almost certain: Someone will be
unhappy. Memorials, because they touch deeply personal emotional
chords, are extraordinarily difficult to design.</TE>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario is a fiasco like the design for the World
War II Memorial on the National Mall. Although that world-changing
event ended a half-century ago, and a certain degree of unanimity
might be said to prevail over its outcome, the memorial currently
being built in Washington has proved to be sharply divisive. On one
side stand those who applaud its vocabulary of triumphal forms, as
well as its insertion between powerful memorials to presidents
Lincoln and Washington. Lined up on the other side are those who
believe the turgid bombast of the design is ill-suited to the
ordinary citizen-soldiers and civilians at home who secured the
victory, and they lament an imperial monument arising on ground where
generations of disenfranchised Americans petitioned their government
in the cause of civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial to the victims of domestic terrorism in Oklahoma City
also gives pause, although of a different kind. I have not seen the
memorial in person, only in photographs of the lawn dotted with 168
empty chairs, the entry arch with the time of the explosion
inscribed, the children's garden and the other elements. But I have
been struck by the reticence with which the memorial has been
greeted. The embrace has been polite rather than warm.</TE>
<TE>   Truly successful memorials elicit a vivid response, despite the
pain and anguish represented by their subject. It's as true of Daniel
Chester French's classic sculpture of an assassinated hero, Abraham
Lincoln (where individual fragility mingles with steely resolve,
slumped exhaustion and rangy eloquence to create a powerful portrait
of human ambivalence) as it is of Maya Lin's stark, earthbound wall
listing the names of Vietnam War dead or Daniel Libeskind's pierced,
twisted, hard-edged design for Berlin's Holocaust Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Complexity and contradiction are the stuff of truth, but the
political posturing around civic remembrance often resists them.
Powerful simplicity is challenged by the merely simplistic, life's
rough edges are polished smooth and shades of gray are erased by a
black-and-white yearning for definitive certainty.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deciding for Whom</TE>
<TE>   the Tribute Is Intended</TE>
<TE>   "Tribute of Light" was initially titled "Towers of Light." The
name was changed when some survivors expressed concern that it would
memorialize buildings, not people. The shift seems appropriate. But
it also signals how enormously difficult the process will be to
arrive at a permanent memorial.</TE>
<TE>   When a work of art is being commissioned, we tend to focus almost
exclusively on the excellence and capacity of the chosen artist. In
practice, though, the quality of the patron or client who does the
choosing is often as important.</TE>
<TE>   Who is the client for a Sept. 11 memorial? The answer includes
groups formed to represent the bereaved families of victims, which
will inevitably favor those nearby in New York City over those from
Boston to California who also lost loved ones. And it includes the
American people at large, who were the psychological target of the
terrorist attack. The design will be reviewed by bureaucrats in the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government agency that
owns the site; developer Larry Silverstein, who holds the lease on
the land; the governor of New York, the mayor of New York City and
federal authorities who hold various purse strings and issue permits;
and others.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps part of the reason a permanent memorial is impossible to
imagine is that it's also impossible to wrap one's mind around this
shape-shifting hydra. Conceived as a gift, "Tribute of Light" is
unhampered by the issue.</TE>
<TE>   One of its chief virtues is its temporal nature. If "Tribute of
Light" disappoints, there will have been no harm in trying. The
opposite of a permanent memorial, it shifts the focus of remembering
away from the eternity of a material object and toward an activity or
endeavor. Remembering, it says, is something you do. It unfolds
through time. It changes coloration. It includes mortality.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, something permanent will be built at ground zero to
memorialize the disaster. Perhaps, though, whatever that "something"
turns out to be can take a cue from "Tribute of Light" and be
accompanied by something temporal and transient.</TE>
<TE>   A Sept. 11 Memorial could be joined by a Sept. 11 Memorial
Foundation, with the sole purpose of commissioning temporal works of
art in perpetuity. An orchestral work. A book of poems. A
performance. A museum exhibition. A teleplay. Another temporal
sculpture like "Tribute of Light," or even a relighting of that
tribute on an anniversary in the future. In a pluralistic nation,
especially one where the pressure to forget the past is also strong,
creating diverse works of art can keep a multiplicity of memories
alive.</TE>

<HD>Portrait of Artist and Anachronisms</HD>
<DH>Playwright David Davalos spoofs the classics and now takes
on Leonardo da Vinci in 'Daedalus,' tonight in Costa Mesa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly 500 years, admirers have wondered what Leonardo da Vinci
was thinking when he bestowed that unforgettable trace of a smile on
Mona Lisa. It is hard to imagine an explanation stranger or more
fanciful than the one David Davalos concocts in his play, "Daedalus."</LD>
<LD>   The curious can check out a staged reading of "Daedalus" tonight
at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Davalos' loosely historical script about Leonardo and his
miraculous but uneasy mixture of artistic and scientific genius wound
its way to South Coast much as Jed Clampett and his clan made their
way to Beverly Hills: Folks just told the playwright that Costa Mesa
was the place he and "Daedalus" ought to be.</LD>
<TE>   "Daedalus" was one of four plays showcased in October at the
Ashland New Plays Festival in Oregon. Theater pros who attended the
festival kept telling Davalos how much "Daedalus" reminded them of
"The Beard of Avon," Amy Freed's comical-historical fantasia that
speculated on the life and creative inspirations of another
Renaissance giant, William Shakespeare. South Coast commissioned
Freed's play and gave it a well-received premiere last year. Like
Freed, Davalos has fun playing with the elevated language from a
lofty long-ago--and bringing it down to earth and close to home with
humorous catch phrases and cultural allusions that a modern audience
can embrace as its own.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who took a liking to "Daedalus" in Ashland were
playwright David Rambo (whose "God's Man in Texas" is at the Geffen
Playhouse in Los Angeles) and veteran Los Angeles theater director
Art Manke. Rambo's agent took on Davalos as a client and sent his
script to South Coast; Manke, a co-founder of the Glendale classical
theater company, A Noise Within, also pitched the script to South
Coast and will direct the reading.</TE>
<TE>   Davalos, who grew up in San Antonio, was chatty and delighted as
he spoke over the phone from his Manhattan apartment about his
pending first step as a playwright in the world of major regional
theater. He marveled at his fortune in drawing a cast of established
A-list stage actors for the reading: Mark Harelik plays Leonardo;
Douglas Sills is the ruthless, charismatic warlord, Cesare Borgia;
and A Noise Within stalwart Robertson Dean reads the part of Niccolo
Machiavelli, the founding theorist of realpolitik.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a babe in the woods," said Davalos, who is in his mid-30s.
"The fact they put together such a powerhouse cast makes it all the
more nerve-wracking." In a good way, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Acting was Davalos' first theatrical calling; he began writing
plays in 1990 and made raiding the classics his modus operandi.</TE>
<TE>   He turned "Henry V" into "Willie the Slick," a spoof of Bill
Clinton's electoral duel with George Bush the elder in 1992. "Richard
III" became "Richard the Thug," an unloving homage to Richard M.
Nixon. "Julius Caesar" inspired "The Tragedie of Johnnius Carson," in
which the stakes were domination over late-night television rather
than the Roman republic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Look at Artist's Struggle to Finish What He Starts</TE>
<TE>   "I've essentially apprenticed with Shakespeare by pillaging his
grave," Davalos said. Now comes "Daedalus," in which the story is his
own speculative invention built from scraps of historical fact. The
play began taking shape when Davalos read the biography "Leonardo:
The Artist and the Man," by Serge Bramly. He learned that in 1502,
Cesare Borgia hired Leonardo as an architect and engineer in charge
of inspecting and repairing military fortifications. At the same
time, Machiavelli was serving as Borgia's diplomatic advisor. By
1503, for reasons Davalos says are unexplained, Leonardo had
abandoned Borgia and affairs of state and returned to his art (he
painted the "Mona Lisa" between 1503 and 1505).</TE>
<TE>   In the play, Davalos imagines a Leonardo disillusioned by art--he
can't seem to finish what he starts, which the playwright says was a
problem for the real Leonardo. He jumps at a chance to work for
Borgia, whom Machiavelli immortalized in his handbook for
politicians, "The Prince." For Machiavelli, Borgia exemplified
effective, pragmatic leadership in which the ends--uniting the
balkanized Italian states and freeing them from foreign
domination--justify the means--treachery, coercion and bloodshed.
Borgia covets Leonardo for his genius at designing weapons--his
sketchbook included prototypes for much of the modern arsenal,
including submarines, tanks, helicopters and airplanes. As a
scientist, Leonardo is seduced by the chance to see his ideas turned
into realities, with Borgia footing the bill. As a humanist, Leonardo
ultimately recoils at the destruction such realities could wreak in
the hands of a Borgia. He abandons the amoral world of war and
politics for the ideal one of art.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather progress dance than march," Leonardo declares
after a climactic debate with Machiavelli over whether the ends can
truly justify the means--and whether Leonardo can best serve humanity
as an artist or an inventor of weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Temperamentally, I'm more inclined to agree with Leonardo.
Science cannot be blindly moving forward because society will find a
way to abuse it," Davalos said. "But, realistically, Machiavelli is
right. History has proven time and again that realists have an
advantage over idealists."</TE>
<TE>   Davalos wanted to have fun with history rather than make his play
an archival exercise. Every character is a witty, well-spoken
quipster. The dialogue in some passages is grand discourse fit for
historical giants, but Davalos also has his characters mouth lines
from "The Godfather" and throws in contemporary jokes, anachronisms
that could give moderns a chuckle. At one point, Machiavelli wonders
whether Leonardo would care to apply his genius to inventing the
paper shredder. "That would be especially useful in my line of work."
In another instance, Leonardo, disgusted with his fortunes as an
artist, hands a patroness a sketch he has made and tells her, "I
believe that and three ducats will purchase you a cup of grappa."</TE>
<TE>   "The Masterpiece Theater thing, the elevated language, is closer
to poetry," Davalos said. "I wanted to go there, but I wanted to have
it both ways by also being colloquial. It's a way of getting the
audience into the world of the play by showing the parallels and
bringing the characters closer to our experience."</TE>
<TE>   Davalos said he devotes about half his time to writing, acting and
directing; the rest is spent making a living as a freelance designer
of graphics used in business presentations. His next play concerns
Ambrose Bierce, the acerbic journalist and fiction writer who
disappeared in 1913 after riding off to join the Mexican
revolutionary Pancho Villa.</TE>
<TE>   "The more research I do into [Bierce's] life and disappearance and
his fiction, the more it seems they are speaking to us now," Davalos
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The trick is to tell a historical story, but tell it so the
audience doesn't feel as though they are looking at an artifact."</TE>

<HD>Fatboy Slim Spins Out Dynamic Beats</HD>

<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big beat takes no prisoners. It dominates and defines, with
limited room for other musical flavors on your local pumping,
thumping dance floor.</LD>
<LD>   Even a master musical surgeon such as Fatboy Slim must give in,
letting his beats do most of the work.</LD>
<LD>   So at his DJ set at the packed Spundae on Saturday, Slim (a.k.a.
Norman Cook) performed a two-hour soundtrack that was inevitably less
about his acclaimed studio work than the party at hand.</LD>
<TE>   However, he brought genuine personality and excitement to the gig,
mixing eclectic tracks from rock, soul, disco, hip-hop and other
genres into a dynamic whole.</TE>
<TE>   Cook was a happy host behind the turntables, arms outstretched,
hopping in place to the sounds and words, pulling out his air horn.</TE>
<TE>   Fans near the DJ booth could see Cook sing along to pieces lifted
from Prince's "I Would Die 4 U," as he looped the phrase, "No need to
worry/ No need to cry/ I'm your messiah and you're the reason why" to
layered effects and an erupting disco beat.</TE>
<TE>   Cook's tour arrived in anticipation of the May release of his
"Live on Brighton Beach," which will document an improvisational DJ
set not unlike his show at Spundae.</TE>
<TE>   At his best, live Fatboy Slim means nonstop dance music with
genuine pop hooks.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, he depended not on one simple predictable rhythm, but
was also confident enough to abruptly skip a beat or two, or to
quickly shuffle his pace, all for dramatic effect. And the big beat
hardly noticed.</TE>

<HD>'The Time Machine' Lands at No. 1 With $22.5 Million</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was back to the future at the box office over the weekend as a new
adaptation of the science-fiction classic "The Time Machine" opened
in first place, according to studio estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The movie, based on the 1895 book by science-fiction master H.G.
Wells and directed by Wells' great-grandson, Simon Wells, took in an
estimated $22.5 million from Friday through Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very strong opening, since only a handful of movies
released in the first half of March ever open to more than $20
million," said Jim Tharp, head of distribution for DreamWorks, which
released the film. "With sci-fi fans and young males being the
predominate audience ... that core audience seemed to really enjoy
the movie."</LD>
<TE>   In second place was "We Were Soldiers," in its second weekend, and
opening in third was "All About the Benjamins," an action comedy
starring Ice Cube.</TE>
<TE>   "Time Machine" was previously made into a movie in 1960, under the
direction of George Pal. The new version stars Guy Pearce as a
scientist from a century ago who builds a time machine while seeking
to undo a tragedy from his past.</TE>
<TE>   It's a live-action debut for Wells, who previously directed the
animated movie "Balto."</TE>
<TE>   "We Were Soldiers," Mel Gibson's Vietnam War saga, held up well
from its opening last weekend, dropping only 29% to take in an
estimated $14.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "All About the Benjamins" opened in 1,505 theaters, compared with
2,944 for "Time Machine," and took in $10.1 million. The film's
per-screen average of $6,728 was not far behind the $7,643 for "Time
Machine."</TE>
<TE>   "All About the Benjamins" stars Ice Cube as a bounty hunter
pursuing a bail-jumping con man (Mike Epps). During the chase, the
two wind up in the middle of a diamond heist.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top five were the comedy "40 Days and 40 Nights"
with $7.1 million and the drama "John Q." with $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of Oscar nominations was also evident this weekend
in the staying power of eighth-place "A Beautiful Mind," 10th-place
"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" and 16th-place
"In the Bedroom." All are best picture nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing to do well in limited release was "Monsoon Wedding."
The film, out three weeks and playing in 76 theaters, took in $10,250
per theater for a total of $779,000.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the take from the weekend's top 12 films was 34% higher
than the same weekend last year, when there was no major opening to
drive receipts.</TE>

<HD>Miscalculations Led to Tussle Over Letterman</HD>

<LD>Fresh from a vacation on the island of St. Barts, David Letterman is
expected to decide this week whether he will sign a new deal with CBS
or move his late-night television show to ABC, where it would
displace "Nightline."</LD>
<LD>   Yet however balmy the Caribbean breeze might have been, the tumult
gripping the media world since news leaked that ABC was courting
Letterman suggests both networks have made mistakes and
miscalculations along the way. Moreover, the situation has shone a
less-than-flattering light on the object of their affections,
Letterman himself.</LD>
<LD>   For its part, CBS misread the marketplace and ABC's desperation in
assuming Letterman had nowhere else to go.</LD>
<TE>   Some TV industry sources say despite Letterman's long list of
demands, the network should have found a way to wrap him up during an
exclusive negotiating period. As it stands, if CBS keeps Letterman,
the network will pay a higher price by virtue of allowing his
representatives to entertain other offers.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, meanwhile, erred in making its Letterman bid with little
thought--or perhaps callous indifference--to the repercussions of
that action on ABC News. Officials at the network and its parent, the
Walt Disney Co., seemed to naively feel they could swoop in and steal
Letterman under the media's radar, then be hailed for their bold
maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   What they lacked, apparently, was a contingency plan should the
tactic prove unsuccessful. They may have also misunderstood the
symbolic nature of their perceived indifference to "Nightline" and
its respected anchor, Ted Koppel, giving rise to speculation about
network news' future within today's media conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   Although Letterman emerges from the situation as the belle of the
ball, with two eager suitors, he doesn't escape entirely unscathed
either. Yes, the host will gain various concessions, among them
having more promotional clout thrown behind his show and a salary
believed to exceed $30 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the emphasis on blaming CBS for the fact that his program
continues to trail "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" in the ratings
indicates Letterman cannot accept what may be the simplest
explanation for that disparity--that though critics embrace him, more
viewers have chosen Leno. Wherever Letterman winds up, there is
little reason to believe that dynamic will change, whether promos for
his show run during CBS' "Survivor" or ABC's "Monday Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   From that perspective, the sole network to come away from the last
few weeks feeling good, or at least relieved, will probably be NBC,
which not only has a loyal workhorse in Leno but also extended its
hold on Conan O'Brien--another proven late-night commodity--shortly
before the current fireworks began.</TE>
<TE>   Leno, who quietly renewed his last contract with a couple of phone
calls, must also feel like a winner. But then, he should be used to
that by now.</TE>

<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep into his 17th season as the Pasadena Symphony's music director,
Jorge Mester concocted another striking program. Heard Saturday night
in Civic Auditorium, this one culminated in Brahms' Violin Concerto,
preceded by two striking American ballet scores from the mid-20th
century: Stravinsky's "Jeu de Cartes" and Copland's "Billy the Kid."</LD>
<LD>   Brahms' main course dominated the evening, yet the two salad
courses offered variety and delight.</LD>
<LD>   Ever the serious virtuoso with a broad repertory, American
violinist Elmar Oliveira, 51, has become a distinctive artist
particularly with the works of this composer.  His Brahms concerto,
in resonant collaboration with Mester and the accomplished Pasadena
ensemble, had breadth, a core of lyric brooding and handsome
detailing.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout, Oliveira maintained Brahms' delicate balance between
struggle and repose, the dichotomy of this work, and at all times he
allowed the musical narrative to unfold convincingly. Only in the
slow movement did both soloist and orchestra press too hard; here,
overstatement crowded out the Adagio's quietude and meditation. The
finale proved as heroic and triumphant as Brahms must have
envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   Copland's familiar "Billy the Kid" Suite became the occasion of
bright display and transparent instrumentalism. The orchestra's
playing boasted style, panache and a deep confidence. Among the
soloists, trumpeter Burnette Dillon earned the bow he received at the
end.</TE>
<TE>   Stravinsky's joyful, acidulous "Jeu de Cartes" opened the program
felicitously, despite occasionally roughshod execution and unpolished
ensemble playing.</TE>

<HD>One Vote for Letterman Over 'Nightline'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA COLLETTA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So Ted Koppel is said to be furious after hearing reports that ABC is
trying to woo David Letterman away from CBS and into "Nightline's"
time slot. Perhaps he should talk to Sela Ward; I bet she's hopping
mad about reports that "Once and Again" is about to get the ax. That
show is also well received critically and has a loyal but small
audience. But no one thought to ask if Ward was furious.</LD>
<LD>   Koppel's anger is newsworthy because he occupies the moral high
ground of journalism. But does anyone really believe that he receives
a seven-figure salary because he's a journalist? Ted Koppel, like all
the high-profile news anchors, is a celebrity. And when you price
yourself into the realm of celebrity, you are subject to the same
vagaries of audience and market share that all celebrities are.</LD>
<LD>   ABC's negotiations with Letterman and the network's decision last
year to move "20/20" from the Friday night time slot it had occupied
for more than a decade have pundits across the land proclaiming that
this marks the beginning of the end of news analysis on network
television. Could this really be a surprise to anyone?</LD>
<TE>   The broadcast networks haven't been in the news-analysis business
for quite a while, and all of the celebrity-driven news shows haven't
been much more than infotainment for the last decade. Barbara
Walters' "20/20" is one of the worst examples of this kind of facile
and pandering "news" show. But surely the People magazine reporting
style of Diane Sawyer and Connie Chung is also responsible for a few
nails in the coffin of serious news programming.</TE>
<TE>   The sad fact of the matter is that network news is about
entertainment. And ratings. Network executives influence the kind of
news covered and the way it is covered.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel, with his aggressively bad haircut and his phlegmatic
speaking style, appears to be quintessentially anti-celebrity and a
paragon of journalistic disinterestedness. But this is his shtick,
like Letterman throwing pencils. Though it is cloaked in the nobility
of journalistic integrity, "Nightline" hasn't been for years the
probing news show it is touted to be. It recently has made efforts to
recapture the power of its past by looking at the complicated issues
of foreign policy after Sept. 11. But the show has been just as
likely in recent years to focus on prurient topics such as O.J.
Simpson, Jon-Benet Ramsey and the sexual adventures of President
Clinton, Monica Lewinsky and Gary Condit.</TE>
<TE>   Even when covering more serious subjects, the best part of the
show is the long (by news programming standards) produced segment,
something rarely seen even on the cable news channels. But the cult
of celebrity requires a personality, on the spot preferably, and this
precludes the kind of thoughtful reporting Koppel made his name
doing.</TE>
<TE>   The talking heads that follow rarely discuss anything in depth.
And though once a formidable journalist, Koppel doesn't really have
the time to develop a probing dialogue with his guests.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the topic, the usual cast of characters is lined up
and they say exactly what you would expect them to say. The few
minutes they get on "Nightline" are just another chance to spin their
version of a story. There is nothing as fresh or revealing as what
occurs on, say, Charlie Rose (partly because Rose is such a flawed
and egocentric interviewer), or Letterman's show, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   With the increasing absurdity of American politics and the seeming
inability of news outlets to thoughtfully challenge it, perhaps the
best way to get a realistic take on things is from a smirky guy like
Letterman. How else but through comedy do you make sense of a
president who is lionized in the media at the same time he is up to
his ears in the Enron scandal and alienating every other country on
the globe?</TE>
<TE>   If difficult topics are going to be reduced to the superficial and
made audience-friendly, I'll take mine with a side of humor.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Colletta is a Sherman Oaks-based writer whose book, "Dark
Humor and Satire in the Modern British Novel," will be published
later this year by Wayne State University Press.</TE>

<HD>Gyuto Monks Create a Dreamlike Experience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The human voice is an essential component in the spiritual life of
most religions throughout the world. And its use is as varied as
cultures, embracing everything from Gregorian chant and the
contrapuntal cantatas of Bach to the qwaali of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
and the orisha songs of Brazilian candomble.</LD>
<LD>   Yet another fascinating variation surfaced at UCLA's Royce Hall on
Saturday night with the performance of the Gyuto Monks Tantric Choir.
The all-male ensemble is part of Gyuto University--founded in Lhasa,
China, in 1474, and relocated to Dharamsala, India, since the Dalai
Lama's exile after the Chinese occupation of Tibet.</LD>
<LD>   The Gyuto Monks, who are touring to raise funds for their
university, have mastered the art of "throat singing." This describes
the ability to manipulate the vocal chords to produce overtone sounds
at the octave, the fifth and so forth.</LD>
<TE>   In the work of the Gyuto Monks, it is a technique applied strictly
to chanting associated with tantric meditation via pieces that
include an introduction, a consecration of the evening and a group of
works celebrating the Buddha nature of meditation. The monks' throat
singing produced some eerie harmonic textures, especially when the
fundamental notes slid from one tone to another, or--even more
impressively--when vocal overtones from different fundamental notes
were combined.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of percussion and horns in the second half enhanced
the already dense qualities of the chanting. It was, for a Western
audience, a daunting experience, with the hypnotic qualities of the
performance placing many listeners into their own dreamlike states.
But it was also a compelling example of the transcendent spiritual
powers of the human voice.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Chamber Orchestra  Gets Irreverent</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even in a season when many programs have been altered due to
circumstances beyond anyone's control, the reshuffling of the Los
Angeles Chamber Orchestra's lineup at the Alex Theatre on Saturday
night was unusually thorough.</LD>
<LD>   William Bolcom's "Commedia" for (almost)18th century orchestra (so
the title says) was originally supposed to kick off the season-opener
last Sept. 22. But after Sept. 11, the piece suddenly disappeared
from the program, only to resurface Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   For anyone who wondered why, the proof was in the listening. This
was Bolcom at his most mischievous, equipped with a saucy little
tune, weird slapstick jokes, a haunting violin duet disturbed by
clatterings from the orchestra, aleatoric chirping ... well, you get
it; it would have been too irreverent for some sensibilities last
fall.</LD>
<TE>   In any case, it was great to hear it again after a long absence
from local stages, and conductor Jeffrey Kahane gave it a fine,
spiffy ride.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when violinist Pamela Frank, recovering from an injury, had
to cancel only a couple of weeks ago, the orchestra was lucky to find
another violin star--and a locally trained one at that--Leila
Josefowicz.</TE>
<TE>   So out went the Zwilich Violin Concerto and Dvorak Romance,
replaced by a work that Josefowicz recently recorded: Prokofiev's
Violin Concerto No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   It was a fascinating performance, with big contrasts between the
cool, almost disembodied approach to the lyrical passages and the
jolts of energy and drive in the first movement and slug-it-out
finale--a concept that might have been better-suited for Prokofiev's
more acerbic Violin Concerto No.1.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even at her most abrasive, Josefowicz displayed amazing
control, hitting every note right in tune.</TE>
<TE>   Finally came the only remnant of the original program, an
exhilarating race through the 18-year-old Schubert's Symphony No. 3,
dispatched with sharp accents and a solid bass end.</TE>

<HD>Si*Se Specializes in Spinning Spells</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sound of heavy rain briefly filled the hot and crowded Temple Bar
during Friday's show by New York's Si*Se, a favorite of alter-Latino
fans. The depressing drizzle set the midnight mood in the dark Santa
Monica club.</LD>
<LD>   "You know what that is?" asked the group's lead singer, Carol C.
(for Cardenas), petite and barefoot with a hip-hugging, wraparound
skirt and tight, shoulder-baring black top. The diva's adoring fans
answered with cheers, as if to say, "Yo si se," which means, "Yes, I
know." They instantly recognized the sound effect that opens "The
Rain," from the group's acclaimed, self-titled 2001 debut album on
the Luaka Bop label. For any newcomers, the dark Dominican beauty and
the five-piece band soon re-created the song's unmistakable mood of
hopeless heartbreak on wet city streets.</LD>
<LD>   Si*Se is among the best of America's new generation of
exploratory, bilingual bands that balance cultural influences as
naturally as they do their multi-ethnic friendships.</LD>
<TE>   Spinning spells is Si*Se's specialty. The relentless pulsing of
drums and bass. The Gypsy-like accents of a mournful viola. The
eerie, mind-bending electronica by programming whiz and producer
Cliff Cristofaro, a.k.a. U.F.LOW. And always, Cardenas' crescendos of
passion, held in long notes and words that bend into extended,
malleable vowels of anguish. She's sultry like Sade and sensuous like
Shakira, with hands and hips gracefully suggesting a hint of Arab
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Her only weakness: pedestrian Spanish lyrics (Cardenas wrote
several songs in the language so that her mother could understand
them). The poor poetic meter can be comical, as with the upbeat
"Bizcocho Amargo," a danceable declaration of independence from a
once sweet relationship that now "tastes like Margo," thanks to a
seriously misplaced accent in her pronunciation. Cardenas meant
bitter (amargo). Ecstatic fans were too busy grooving to notice or
care.</TE>

<HD>It's a Living History of the Newport Jazz Festival</HD>

<LD>The Newport Jazz Festival, in its salad years, was among the music's
great glories. Surrounded by sun-dappled waters at the confluence of
Narragansett Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, the annual summer events
provided some of the genre's most defining moments via performances
by legendary figures ranging from Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk
to Miles Davis and Charles Mingus.</LD>
<LD>   The Newport Jazz 2002 ensemble that performed at UCLA's Royce Hall
Friday night wasn't lacking in all-star participants, either, with a
lineup that included  trumpeter Terence Blanchard, saxophonists Joe
Lovano and Justo Almario, guitarist Howard Alden, pianist Cedar
Walton, bassist Peter Washington and drummer Idris Muhammad.</LD>
<LD>   Presumably assembled to embrace a range of styles--the Cuban roots
of Almario, the swing elements of Laden, the bebop of Blanchard,
Lovano and Walton--the group served as a kind of living metaphor
representing the five decades of Newport Jazz Festival history.</LD>
<TE>   There were many moments in which that history came vividly to
life. Blanchard's passionate rendering of "Goodbye" was a
particularly poignant example, one of several solos illuminated by
the vocalized qualities of his half-valve trumpet work and the fiery
intensity of his rhythmic phrasing.</TE>
<TE>   Almario and Lovano, occasionally tossing phrases back and forth in
classic, tenor saxophone battle style, were equally impressive, with
Lovano's too infrequently heard lyrical side also surfacing in "A
Portrait of Jenny," and Almario bringing the capacity crowd to life
with his own "Salvation Army." Walton, as he always does, displayed
his unique capacity to bring structure, cohesion and a rich harmonic
inventiveness to his soloing--vividly so in a medley of Billy
Strayhorn tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Although Alden's solo style was somewhat out of sync with the
other player, his blues-driven solos added intriguing moments of
contrast. What separated the evening from the glory days of Newport,
however, was the generally uneven quality of the rhythm section.</TE>
<TE>   The versatile Muhammad's eclectic career has taken him from Sam
Cook and Roberta Flack to John Scofield and Sonny Rollins, but on
this evening, at least, he rarely managed to find a propulsive
rhythmic pocket. It was the one element in this otherwise appealing
program that distinctly separated it from the early, hard-swinging,
glory days of the original Newport Festival.</TE>

<LD>Sexism, commercialism and homophobia were the fundamental issues
addressed by the fierce females of two underground sensations,
headliners Le Tigre and second-billed Chicks on Speed, to a capacity
crowd at the El Rey Theater on Friday. But the night's most
compelling message was ultimately about the power and politics of
dancing.</LD>
<LD>   Munich-based techno-wave trio Chicks on Speed, known for their
arty presentations and do-it-yourself aesthetic, started strong with
their sardonic take on Cracker's "Euro Trash Girl," enhanced by black
light that made each member (dressed in white, homemade frocks
emblazoned with the names of technology corporations such as Compaq
and Hitachi) seem as vibrant as the sounds bursting out of their
synthesizers.</LD>
<LD>   But their quirky show grew tedious with each successive mechanical
rhythm and off-key rant. Though simplicity is part of their charm on
record, in a live forum the Chicks just seem robotic.</LD>
<TE>   Le Tigre also uses get-up-and-boogie beats to fuel its ideas, but
with much more depth.</TE>
<TE>   Though the band spews less vitriol than leader Kathleen Hanna's
previous group, riot grrrl pacesetter Bikini Kill, it's no less
didactic.</TE>
<TE>   Projected images of influential females such as Patti Smith and
Billie Jean King, as well as footage of self-defense classes and
girls breakdancing, made the pro-woman, pro-gay thrust of the band
inescapable.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Le Tigre's funky, punky ditties (made mostly
electronically, but enlivened by guitar from Hanna and co-songwriter
Johanna Fateman) never felt overtly negative, even on anti-misogyny
anthems ("FYR") and fervent calls to action ("Keep on Livin'").</TE>
<TE>   The mix of colorful, matching outfits, feisty-fun vocals and even
choreographed dance moves showed Hanna and company spreading feminism
in a subtle yet commanding way--by speaking their minds while
celebrating physicality and the freedom to bump 'n' grind.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Working hard to make friends on its first local visit, the National
Song and Dance Company of Mozambique offered a vigorous overview of
distinctive African traditions and history in a two-part program at
El Camino College on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Formed in 1979 and professionalized in 1983, the company is
smaller and less artful in choreographic expression than the older,
better known Les Ballets Africains (from Guinea) and the National
Dance Company of Senegal.</LD>
<LD>   Too many pieces by general director David Abilio begin at maximum
overdrive and stay there indefinitely, demanding that the 19 dancers
remain inexhaustible but going nowhere creatively.</LD>
<TE>   The women excel at combined hip rotations and torso contractions
while the men's vocabulary emphasizes forceful stamping and kicking.</TE>
<TE>   Ensembles frequently sweep on and off stage, but most of the
dancing stays in place, full front, with minimal traveling steps or
interpersonal contact.</TE>
<TE>   Five musicians provide energetic percussion accompaniments, and
though it's easy to enjoy the rousing, celebratory result, only the
costumes by Boaventura Hilario and the interludes of a cappella
singing and marimba playing bring needed variety to the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Abilio's seven-part suite "In Mozambique the Sun Has Risen Up"
dates from 1985, the 10th anniversary of the country's independence.
Although it builds to a typically dynamic finale, it never tops its
more subdued opening: "Tufu/Nssope," in which 10 women, wearing gold
sarongs with white blouses, execute the sharpest shoulder
articulations imaginable, then perform a series of difficult
jump-rope solos in a disarming, mock-casual style.</TE>
<TE>   Adding native steps to European parade-ground formations,
"N'Ganda" depicts the World War I era, when Mozambique villagers
fought with the British against the Germans. And "Semba" adds a naive
quasi-narrative garnish to happy group dances.</TE>
<TE>   Abilio also attempts a darker portrait of Afro-Euro relations and
a more ambitious use of narrative in the hourlong epic "N'tsay." This
parable of colonialism shows a white-masked figure on stilts
corrupting free villagers and initiating an era of misery.</TE>
<TE>   But if the portraits of the women's slavery and the men's forced
labor are undeniably moving, Abilio fails to make the oppressor seem
powerful enough to generate such calamity--and he's much too easily
overthrown by collective action. If only life imitated art.</TE>

<HD>A Life in Concert With the Arts</HD>
<DH>Music* Bernard Haitink has made a career of the thing he
loves: conducting. He's now on tour with Vienna Philharmonic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The voice is warm, urbane and gentlemanly in an old-school European
manner. But don't be deceived. Conductor Bernard Haitink knows how to
play hardball.</LD>
<LD>   Prior to the recent closure of London's Royal Opera House--for a
controversial four-year renovation project that ultimately cost
$300-million--Haitink felt he had to play his ace. He resigned the
post of music director, which he had held since 1989, then "allowed"
himself to be coaxed back after concessions on all sides were made.</LD>
<LD>   "I had to use that as a weapon," Haitink, 73, said recently from
Vienna, where he was rehearsing with the Vienna Philharmonic. Haitink
and the philharmonic are appearing today through Wednesday at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a crisis. There was going to be a closure of the house;
then they would start with a clean sheet. That would not be as easy
as they thought. I succeeded in keeping the orchestra and chorus and
music intact because it's not easy to get good people back."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he agreed to stay through 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I proved to be right. The opera house is open again [as
of December 2000]. This season is extremely successful. That is
satisfactory. There was a lot of controversy. All of a sudden, that
controversy has disappeared. There's literally no criticism anymore,
which also is alarming because an opera house needs to invite
criticisms."</TE>
<TE>   But now, after 15 years, Haitink is making good on his plan to
leave the Royal Opera. His tour as invited conductor with the Vienna
orchestra is more indicative of his future: mostly symphonic work.
He'll soon be taking over the musical leadership of the Dresden
Staatskapelle, and he will continue his guest conducting, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a spring chicken anymore, but I'm optimistic enough to
have accepted Dresden," Haitink said. "An opera house is a hothouse.
There are so many interests you have to work with--directors, scenic
designers, management."</TE>
<TE>   Directors in particular make things hot in opera land.</TE>
<TE>   "Having worked with Peter Hall and Trevor Nunn, those were a great
match," Haitink said. "But Wagner said an awful thing when he said,
'You must always do something new.' [Directors] take that to heart,
excessively."</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, he says, "a symphony comes close to being
paradise."</TE>
<TE>   Haitink came late to opera, after a long symphonic career, so he
knows the differences well.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Amsterdam on March 4, 1929, he first worked as a violinist
in the Radio Philharmonic in Hilversum, then after some conducting
studies, began leading the orchestra. In 1961, he became the
youngest-ever principal conductor at the prestigious Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, in a joint appointment with
Eugen Jochum. In 1964, Haitink took over sole responsibility of the
ensemble and stayed until 1988.</TE>
<TE>   He was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic from
1967-79, becoming its president in 1990. He has been principal guest
conductor of the Boston Symphony since 1995. He made his American
debut in 1958, leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Haitink prefers long associations to hopscotching guest
appearances, even through he has led most of the major orchestras of
the world. He also has a long recording history with EMI, including
operas by Mozart, Wagner, Verdi, Strauss, Britten and others. It was
not until 1972 that he conducted his first opera, Mozart's "The
Abduction From the Seraglio" at Glyndebourne, where in 1977 he
succeeded John Pritchard as musical director.</TE>
<TE>   All along, however, he was conducting the symphonic music close to
his heart, some of which he'll perform with the Vienna Philharmonic
in Costa Mesa--Haydn, Mozart, Bruckner, Strauss and Berg.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all music of Vienna," he said. "The Vienna Philharmonic
can't ignore 19th century Romantic repertory, and Berg's Three Pieces
for Orchestra is very Viennese, in the sense that it was finished
Aug. 10, 1914, right before the Great War broke out. [It has the]
symbolic feeling of near catastrophe. I think it is appropriate now."</TE>
<TE>   Haitink realizes that orchestras have their own hothouse issues.
He had no comment on the Vienna Philharmonic's 150-plus-year-old
policy (rescinded just prior to its 1997 tour to the United States)
of excluding women, other than to say that "the Viennese are
conservatives and like to stick to the old rules. But there are quite
a number of women who play in other orchestras in Vienna."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the makeup of the orchestra, each ensemble should
have its own unique style, he said, and that's another challenge in
the world of symphonic music.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger now is that orchestras tend to sound like each other.
Because maybe the CD, or the international thing. Let's face it. We
all travel. Orchestras travel. That's a danger also for artists and
for conductors. It's very important that one keeps one's own
character."</TE>
<TE>   Haitink's character, at least in conducting, has been called
"undemonstrative." He is described as a leader who allows the music
to speak for itself. He feels that what's on the page must be
respected, but he says that's only the starting point.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls great performances that were not exactly to the letter,
he said. "Art is something of human beings, and it would be awful for
all of us to do exactly the same thing. Music is such an elusive art.
I conduct pieces that I have lived with my whole musical life. I'm
grateful for that. It's wonderful to evolve with them. I never get
bored."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Haitink will lead the Vienna Philharmonic in three
different programs today through Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $34
to $109. (714) 556-2787.</TE>

<HD>The Rebel From Vienna</HD>
<DH>HK Gruber blends the traditional with the eclectic in his
trumpet concert 'Aerial.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think what we might about aspects of its politics, about some of its
social attitudes, Vienna is an inescapable spiritual capital for
classical music lovers. From the city and its culture came the heart
of the 18th and 19th century standard repertory. And modern music was
born, if not exactly nurtured, there at the beginning of the 20th
century.</LD>
<LD>   Musical Vienna is thus regularly in our midst and on our minds,
but even more so at the moment. This evening the Vienna Philharmonic
begins a Costa Mesa visit with programs of core Viennese repertory.
The Los Angeles Philharmonic, ever attuned to the First Viennese
School (that of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven) has an upcoming Mozart
festival and is, season long, focusing on the Second (instigated by
Schoenberg). Meanwhile, it has invited to town the leading figure of
the so-called Third Viennese School, HK Gruber, whose recent trumpet
concert, "Aerial," had its U.S. premiere Friday night at Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<TE>   Gruber is Viennese blue blood. Direct descendant of the composer
of "Silent Night," former Vienna Choir Boy, and for many years a
member of the Austrian Radio Orchestra (double bass), he is also a
rebel. He has infected Viennese high art with shocking popular
culture. More shocking still, he is irreverent and funny. In a wacky
television film 11 years ago, Gruber celebrated the bicentennial of
Mozart's death by trundling through the disgusting grunge of Vienna's
sewers looking for Mozartean detritus. His most famous work,
"Frankenstein!!," makes him seem part of the Vienna branch of the
P.D.Q. Bach clan.</TE>
<TE>   But there is also a serious side to Gruber, who was powerfully
influenced by the Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht agitprop. Nor has he
entirely overthrown mighty Viennese musical tradition or the potent
influence of Schoenberg and his followers. "Aerial" is a mature
synthesis of all these elements. It is also dramatically exciting,
intellectually compelling, theatrical, visceral and altogether
gorgeous.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe just a little bit disingenuous. In an Upbeat Live
conversation between the composer and Hakan Hardenberger (the
phenomenal Swedish trumpet player for whom the concerto was written),
Gruber spoke about how he, anti-imperialist that he is, would never
subscribe to the old-fashioned Viennese hierarchy of soloist as hero,
and musicians of the orchestra as the lesser figures in the
background. And to his credit, he does give the orchestra interesting
and intricate music to play in a dialogue with the solo trumpet. But
I can't imagine anyone in the audience not having been riveted  by
Hardenberger, who called this the most difficult and complex concerto
he has ever played.</TE>
<TE>   "Aerial" looks down on Austria as if from space, so that Vienna
seems to merge into the globe and world history at large. The first
movement takes its title, "Done With the Compass--Done With the
Chart!" from Emily Dickinson, and invokes musical creation. It begins
with Hardenberger singing and playing into the trumpet,
simultaneously creating otherworldly chords against a glinting
background of string harmonics and twinkling percussion.</TE>
<TE>   Resonances of various sorts are a key element of the concerto,
with Hardenberger displaying an array of trumpet mutes and also
playing a traditional Swedish cow horn. The movement is an exercise
in mesmerizing extended melody, often embellished by the trumpet with
a Miles Davis brand of cool virtuosity as well as some bits of
ecstatic Eastern ornamentation. And all this is impishly made from
hidden 12-tone rows, Schoenberg style.</TE>
<TE>   The second movement, "Gone Dancing," is a tribute to Fred and
Ginger, with Gruber's telescope now trained on Hollywood, 1940,
although unsteadily, as it occasionally lurches toward Vienna,
Eastern Europe and  North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Dance steps are slowly tried out and embroidered. It gets raucous
and then, with the slightest hint of Viennese coyness, ethereal. The
ending is a return to raw resonance, as the trumpeter walks into the
orchestra and plays trumpet tones into the piano, causing its strings
to sympathetically vibrate.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Harding was on the podium. He first conducted the Los
Angeles Philharmonic at the Ojai Festival in 1997 as a 21-year-old of
tremendous promise. Now, with his first appearance at Chandler
Pavilion, he is a seasoned conductor and a major international
figure.  He opened the program with a sensitive and loving account of
Ives' "Central Park in the Dark," its quiet, vaporous string music
and distant pop tunes of the time in the winds offering a kind of
American preview of "Aerial."</TE>
<TE>   After intermission came Strauss' grand tone poem, "Ein
Heldenleben" (A Hero's Life), the composer's feigned celebration of
himself, his battle with the critics, his infatuation with his
quirky, impossible wife and his contented old age. It was vividly
played. Harding has an impetuous side and fought Strauss' absurd
battles as though he meant them. He painted Pauline, Strauss' wife,
with great broad strokes. It wasn't the last word in character
finding, but an impressive performance nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Concertmaster Martin Chalifour played the violin solos
representing Pauline with elegance, although Harding seemed to push
for something a little more rapturous. I am glad the violinist held
back. With the musical and social nuances of "Aerial" in the ear,
Strauss' mock megalomania could too easily sound like the genuine
article.</TE>

<LD>How will you make it on your own? This world is awfully big, and
girl, this time you're all alone....</LD>
<LD>   As tonight's premiere of "The American Embassy" opens (9 p.m.
Fox), Emma Brody (Arija Bareikis) is having a Mary Richards moment. A
smothering mother, a failed romance and a general case of the blahs
convince the Ohio State grad that what she needs most in life is to
make a fresh start, so it's off to London to take that vice consul
job with the U.S. Embassy.</LD>
<LD>   Emma is intent on leaving all the old baggage behind, but when the
airline leaves her real baggage behind as well, it signals a bumpy
ride ahead for the series' centerpiece.</LD>
<TE>   "The American Embassy," smashingly filmed on location in England,
is billed as a drama, but it spends much of its premiere episode
floating along in a frothy romantic-comedy gear, and it does so
rather effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Bareikis ("Deuce Bigalow"), who bears a resemblance to actress
Terri Garr, is a likable performer who can throw off some serious
sparks in scenes with the new men in her orbit, particularly wolfish
CIA agent Doug Roach (David Cubitt).</TE>
<TE>   The embassy is staffed with the requisite eccentric characters for
Emma to play off of, and then there's the audibly amorous roommate
and the cross-dressing neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Just to make sure there's enough to occupy viewers, the embassy
has to deal with cases involving a naked American, a child-custody
fight and even a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The gears do grind when the show tries to pull off these
considerable shifts in tone, but the production from Jersey
Television (an arm of Danny DeVito's Jersey Films) and 20th Century
Fox feels solid enough to offer some hope that these things can be
smoothed out.</TE>
<TE>   Emma, you might just make it after all.</TE>

<LD>With the death last month of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel
Pearl, the film "Harrison's Flowers" could not be more topical. The
drama scheduled to open Friday stars Andie MacDowell as a
newsmagazine photo editor whose husband, a photojournalist,
disappears on assignment in Croatia. Desperate to find him, she makes
the trek out to the war-torn nation, enlisting the help of his
photojournalist buddies also shooting the war. She quickly finds that
the perceived prestige of being a war correspondent is quickly
shattered by reality.</LD>
<LD>   The movie is inspired by Sipa Press photojournalist Isabel
Ellsen's biography, in which she describes the brutal reality of
covering conflicts around the world. Ellsen, who served as a
part-time consultant for the actors, carries around an old Nikon with
a lens that was bent by a machete swipe intended for her head while
covering wars in Africa.</LD>
<LD>   "Harrison's Flowers," which also stars David Strathairn as the
disappeared husband, may resonate with American audiences because of
the Pearl abduction and subsequent execution. Pearl had the highest
profile of any journalist killed in the U.S. war against terrorism,
but he is not the only one. So far, nine journalists from all over
the world have been killed in the war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   For some, the trauma of seeing so much human misery becomes too
much to bear. In 1994 Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Kevin
Carter killed himself only months after winning the prestigious award
for his harrowing shot of a vulture patiently waiting for an
emaciated Sudanese child to die. "Few journalists saw as much
violence and trauma as he did," noted Scott MacLeod, then Time
magazine's South Africa bureau chief, in a tribute to the
photographer. "Yet the photograph that epitomized Sudan's famine
would win Kevin Carter fame," MacLeod said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the horrors of war, many photojournalists become hooked on
the adrenaline rush that being in the thick of the action provides.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Ut, the AP photographer who shot the 1973 Pulitzer
Prize-winning photo of terrified Vietnamese children fleeing their
village after a napalm attack, can attest to the horror and the high
of covering war. "I have covered wars for many years; you see tragedy
every day," Ut said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "You keep going because it's your job. Because I cover wars I know
that someday I may die, but I enjoy taking pictures. I need the
action."</TE>

<LD>There are humans in the room at the back of the American Legion Hall
in Culver City, but it's the birds you notice first. Huge blue and
yellow macaws and snow-white cockatoos, budgies and lovebirds all
about, perched on their owners' shoulders, or resting on the backs of
the metal folding chairs, all talking.</LD>
<LD>   A pheasant with brilliant red and green curved feathers is
wandering under a table. Another table holds snacks--one-half is for
the humans and the other is labeled "For Birds Only!" to protect its
array of nuts and other finger-tempting goodies.</LD>
<LD>   Lorrie Mitchell, who has six parrots, is here with her double
yellow-headed Amazon, Carla, happily perched on her shoulder. Carla,
a 16-year-old large green parrot with bright yellow on her head, is
excitedly repeating her favorite phrase, "I'm a green chicken!"</LD>
<TE>   Mitchell says Carla, who also sings "Over the Rainbow," "knows how
to work a crowd ... She'll meow and as soon as everyone is standing
around watching her, she'll laugh at them."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the West Los Angeles Bird Club--feathered and
otherwise--have gathered for their regular monthly meeting. And while
you might be tempted to conclude that this is a gathering of odd
ducks, they are not alone in this pursuit. In cities across the
country, bird clubs are thriving, bringing pets and their human
companions together to exchange information and socialize. In New
York City, it's the Big Apple Bird Assn. In California, there are at
least 40--including the West. L.A. club, the West Valley Bird Society
in Sherman Oaks, the South Bay Bird Society in Torrance, and the new
Parrot Society of Los Angeles in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   While cats (just try to get one to go to a meeting with you), may
still rank as the country's No. 1 pet choice, and dogs the second,
birds are No. 3 in popularity with an estimated 40 million in the
U.S. today, according to the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, a
trade group. About half of bird owners have more than one bird, and,
on average, pet-bird households have 2.7 birds in residence.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Levine is not only a multiple bird owner, she is a member
of multiple bird clubs. It started a decade ago when she was shopping
for a fish and found a bird, her pet cockatiel, Peep. She now has
expanded her pet flock: There is Pete. who turned out to be a girl;
Scruffy; Wheezy, who wheezes from a congenital heart problem, and his
love, Ruby; Topper; Toddler; Carrot the Parrot; Harey, who has a
deformed beak, and his love, Mary; and two Goffin cockatoos. She
attends eight bird club meetings, including one specializing in
pigeons, each month.</TE>
<TE>   Birds are creatures of the wild, but as pets, they often form
strong bonds with humans--a bond strengthened by the fact that
parrots and myna birds can easily learn to speak words and sentences
of human language.</TE>
<TE>   Bird-keeping was popularized in the United States in the 1920s by
a young German emigre, Max Stern, who brought to New York City birds
from Germany's Hartz Mountains (hence the name of his company).</TE>
<TE>   It got another boost after World War II when air travel became
commercialized, and it became easier to transport birds from exotic
locales.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s there was a U.S. outbreak of VVND, a strain of
avian Newcastle disease especially dangerous to poultry. It hit the
Los Angeles area particularly hard, and for two years the bird trade
shut down and many birds died.</TE>
<TE>   Toucans, ringnecks and myna birds were banned until 1974, when a
quarantine system could ensure that only healthy birds were imported.
The changes triggered a resurgence in the popularity of pet birds,
which has not abated.</TE>
<TE>   While one might assume that someone who pays $1,000 for a pet--the
price of a medium-size parrot--is unlikely to neglect it, that is not
always the case. They are not take-care-of-themselves pets, often
live much longer than other pets,  are not always nice to be around
and can be very loud. The average cockatoo,  with 500 pounds of
pressure in its beak,  can turn a piece of furniture into toothpicks.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on their size, parrots in captivity have a life span of
25 to 150 years. Their longevity and special needs have left them
vulnerable to changes in the circumstances of owners, such as those
who are genuinely devoted but can no longer care for the birds, and,
more often,  those who simply lose interest.</TE>
<TE>   This helps explain why most bird clubs also serve as networks for
the rescue of birds who have been abandoned or are at risk. For every
bird properly cared for, it is suspected that many more are being
abused, neglected or left homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Dave and Liz Friedman of Culver City and members of the West L.A
Bird Club find that the birds they love most are the least exotic.
They rehabilitate wounded or disabled wild birds such as finches,
starlings, mourning doves and sparrows.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will rescue a wounded falcon or hawk, but who wants
to spend time or money on a sparrow who can't fly?" says Dave
Friedman. Their rescues have also included a quail and a baby duck
whose mother and siblings were killed. After a month or two they
usually re-release them into the wild. "There's a lot of satisfaction
knowing you saved something that otherwise would die," Friedman says.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting since 1974, South Bay Bird Society is the oldest bird club
in the area. While the group doesn't allow pet birds at meetings, it
maintains roughly the same number of members--about 100--as the other
local clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The society's annual Birdtique, held in July, attracted 500
visitors last year and featured 30 nonprofit parrot education and
rescue groups, vendors and other bird clubs.</TE>
<TE>   This year, club president Janet Ragonesi says they hope to add
bird exhibits, "so people will be able to tell the difference between
a cockatiel and a cockatoo."</TE>
<TE>   Each club has its own specialty or claim to fame. At West Valley
Bird Society, it might well be its elaborate raffle table. Most bird
clubs feature raffles to defray costs and help raise money for their
pet projects. But at West Valley, raffle tickets  sell for different
prices for a variety of items on a table piled high with macaw toys,
gourmet bird food and housewares with bird themes.</TE>
<TE>   The recently formed Parrot Society of Los Angeles meets in a tony
hotel in Marina del Rey. In addition to the shared objective with
other clubs of bird care education, the Parrot Society is aiding in
the preservation of natural parrot habitats and protection of the
birds in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   At its last meeting, the speaker was Charles Munn III, director of
Tropical Nature, a conservation organization whose efforts with
ecotourism have secured millions of acres for wild parrots in the
Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon jungles. The Parrot Society also has an
adoption network for birds that are given up by their owners or
rescued from abusive situations, which is now considered a crisis by
pet bird experts.</TE>
<TE>   At the West Valley club, Linda Lindsay's two double yellow-headed
Amazons, Frankie, a 45-year-old male rescued five years ago, and
Bosco, an 8-year-old female, sit next to each other on a perch atop
their travel case, more interested in each other than in the
evening's events.</TE>
<TE>   Frankie is finally safe after years of abuse at the hands of a
previous owner and 17 years spent sharing an 18-by-18-inch parakeet
cage with another Amazon.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very sick, very mean," says Linda. Today, he is healthy,
and happy too, she says, since he's in love with Bosco.</TE>
<TE>   At the February meeting of the West L.A. Bird Club, members chat
and mill around the snack tables until the evening's events begin.
Many have brought along their birds, but not all--and having a pet
bird is not a requirement for attending.</TE>
<TE>   Avian veterinarian Attila Molnar gives a heady presentation of
avian physiology, including details of how birds fly and why they
need to stay warm.  He is followed by the impressive acrobatics of
five macaws in Steve Reverditto's  show, "Tricks Without Treats.''
The finale, a scarlet macaw in full flight  over the  roomful of
attendees, gets a round of "oohs" and "aahs."</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled for the March meeting this Wednesday: Parrot expert Joel
Tatom, who will bring some unusual lories with him, and Melissa
Berger, a bird-loving belly dancer whose  Senegal parrot, Luisa, will
perform with her.</TE>

<LD>OAXACA JOURNAL</LD>
<LD>   By Oliver Sacks</LD>
<LD>   National Geographic Directions</LD>
<TE>   162 pages, $20</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy at home or bullied at school, some children turn to the
world of fantasy for consolation. Others have turned instead to the
natural world. Oliver Sacks, who recollected his unhappy school
experiences and his early love affair with chemistry in his recent
memoir "Uncle Tungsten," not only grew up to be a prominent clinical
neurologist but also a writer with a rare gift for communicating the
excitement of science and medicine to the general, nonspecialist
reader.</TE>
<TE>   In books such as "Awakenings," about a group of patients coming
back to normal consciousness after suffering from sleeping sickness
for decades, "Seeing Voices: A Journey Into the World of the Deaf"
and "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat," about people afflicted
with various neurological disorders from amnesia to aphasia, Sacks
has explored the complicated terrain where mind and matter interfuse.</TE>
<TE>   Sacks' central interest is in the mysteries of the human brain and
nervous system. But he is also a keen amateur botanist with a
consuming passion for ferns. Ever since boyhood, he confesses, these
leafy, green, flowerless plants delighted him "with their curlicues,
their crosiers, their Victorian quality (not unlike the frilled
antimacassars and lacy curtains in our house). But at a deeper
level," he continues, "they filled me with wonder because they were
of such ancient origin. All of the coal that heated our home, my
mother told me, was essentially composed of ferns or other primitive
plants, greatly compressed.</TE>
<TE>   " ... Ferns had survived, with little change, for a third of a
billion years. Other creatures, like dinosaurs, had come and gone,
but ferns, seemingly so frail and vulnerable, had survived all the
vicissitudes, all the extinctions the earth had known."</TE>
<TE>   A journey organized by the American Fern Society in search of
specimens is what takes Sacks somewhere he has never been before:
Oaxaca, Mexico, a destination as rich in archeological and cultural
history as in natural history. It is Sacks' first trip to Mexico.
Although he is unfamiliar with the country and can't speak Spanish,
the moment he steps onto the plane taking him there he feels a sense
of welcome. The Mexicans he meets strike him as extremely
well-informed about their country's past, both pre- and
post-Columbian, and eager to share their knowledge with visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Published in the National Geographic Directions series featuring
travel writing by all sorts of prominent literary figures, from
Francine Prose on Sicily to A.M. Homes on Los Angeles, "Oaxaca
Journal" is Sacks' relaxed yet observant account of his 10-day
fern-finding excursion.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, he finds a lot more than ferns: teeming
marketplaces filled with exotic (to him, anyway) foods; breathtaking
Zapotec and Aztec ruins; ornate Roman Catholic churches; fossils that
speak of the prehistoric past; and living, breathing human beings who
leave just as deep an impression, from a master weaver keeping alive
an ancient craft, to Boone Hallberg, a boundlessly knowledgeable and
resourceful botanist dedicated to helping the local farmers maintain
their autonomy and way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Sacks' Oaxacan journey sets him thinking about life in all its
forms, from the peaceful, purposeful lives of village artisans
carrying on an ancient tradition of craftsmanship to the tiny
bacteria that are the only organisms on Earth capable of converting
atmospheric nitrogen into forms that can be used by the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   His thoughtful, sometimes wistful ruminations, no matter how
expansive they may grow, are always rooted in the concrete details he
has observed.</TE>
<TE>   A brilliant red flower sets him thinking of the co-evolution of
flowering plants and the insects they attract, and of the red and
orange fruits that "seem only to have appeared in the last thirty
million years or so, in tandem with the evolution of trichromatic
vision in monkeys and apes" who could easily spot them amid the dense
green foliage.</TE>
<TE>   His own preference for the flowerless green world of ferns he
explains more fancifully: "A world ... with a charming modesty, where
reproductive organs--stamens and pistils--are not thrust out
flamboyantly but concealed, with a certain delicacy, on the
undersides of leafy fronds." Yet this modesty and simplicity have
endured for eons.</TE>
<TE>   Sacks not only delights in the natural and cultural riches of
Oaxaca but in the company of his fellow fern enthusiasts. His trip is
a true vacation because it provides him with a respite from the
competitiveness he encounters in his professional life. Here among
the fern lovers, he feels immersed in the genial, open-hearted spirit
of amateurism.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to scientific fieldwork, Sacks reminds us, the
observant eye of the amateur can be as important as the trained eye

<HD>Surely, She Jests</HD>
<DH>It's the middle of the week. The audience is laughing. The
monologues are raunchy. And all the comedians are women.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An unending stream of sitcom reruns plays on television every night,
but in Los Angeles, some people prefer to go out and search for
laughs, even on a dark and stormy night. On Wednesday, an audience of
140 mostly young men and women braved rain-slicked streets to see an
array of all-female comics perform at the Laugh Factory. They did not
come to consider whether women can be as funny as men, or if
professionally witty women are oppressed by gender-specific
stereotypes and a sexist comedy establishment. They came to laugh.</LD>
<LD>   Since January, the Sunset Strip comedy club has been hosting a
changing lineup of stand-up comedians on Wednesday nights, calling
the midweek show "Inside the Girls' Locker Room." From 10 till well
after midnight, a responsive crowd chuckles at stories about
mothers-in-law, therapists, strippers, gynecologists, dates from hell
and parents. The lighter side of supermarket rage, premenstrual
syndrome, body odor, drugs, pornography, childbirth and marriage is
visited. When the delivery is right, Vietnamese nail salons, Catholic
school girls, Monica Lewinsky, Martha Stewart and Hitler inspire
guffaws. The women draw some of their comedy from their black,
Jewish, Irish or Mexican backgrounds. They follow an unwritten code,
which seems to judge ethnic slurs against one's own tribe as
permissible and fat jokes cross-culturally amusing.</LD>
<TE>   The mistress of ceremonies is Sheena Metal, half of the Sheena and
the Princess team whose weekly show on KSLX is the only program on
the FM talk radio station with female hosts. Metal opens the show by
vowing there will be no whining onstage, no boy bashing, just
aggressively raunchy monologues by women who reserve the right to
talk as dirty as male comics always have. "I've learned that my fans
want to hear the filthy stuff," she says backstage before going on.
"They want to hear what I can't say on the radio."</TE>
<TE>   Metal doesn't break the audience in gently. It is evident that if
they don't want to hear a woman discuss sex, sex toys, bodily fluids,
bodily functions and sexual dysfunction, they might as well leave.
Although she has promoted "Inside the Girls' Locker Room" on the air
and through her e-mail network, some in the crowd came to the club
unaware of the night's special program. Tourists curious about the
L.A. comedy scene, couples who want some entertainment with their
alcohol and a few groups of college students, all are willing to give
the comedians a chance, even if they're as surprised by the
estrogen-heavy roster as they'd be if they'd wandered into a real
women's changing room. On a more typical night at the comedy club,
the ratio of men to women comics is 8-1.</TE>
<TE>   The pioneer women of stand-up--Joan Rivers, Totie Fields and
Phyllis Diller--were consistently self-deprecatory. Then came
Roseanne, whose angry, erotically blunt voice announced her arrival
as the fierce domestic goddess. Metal manages to uphold those
traditions, and to extend and tweak them in her own way. Although she
confides she lost 120 pounds in the last year, she still considers
herself overweight and long ago abandoned euphemisms for her size.
When she describes her voracious sexual appetite and the lengths
she'll go to satisfy it, the audience isn't sure whether she's
kidding. She throws their prejudice right back at them. Having
offered a group of good-looking young men cash for services she'd
like them all to render, she says, "You think I wouldn't do that,
just because I'm fat?" Her wicked grin answers her own question.</TE>
<TE>   After Metal has explained to the audience that hormonal upsets are
a scam perpetrated by women bent on getting their way from men, she
asks, "Isn't this great? We're so informative."</TE>
<TE>   The evening's message, if any, is truth, Metal believes. "It isn't
about vulgarity or profanity, it's about women being honest and not
caring if they sound sexy," she says. "The fantasy is that women who
look like Pamela Anderson are hot, and they're the only ones who want
sex all the time. There's a huge dichotomy between the women men
fantasize about and who they get to be with. Most men want to [bed]
Pamela Anderson, and they wind up having sex with women who look like
me."</TE>
<TE>   Metal does five minutes of material between each performer's
10-minute set. There's Sarah Silverman, whose cerebral, occasionally
political brand of trash talk is delivered at a low decibel level;
Rachel Bertrand, a wholesome Canadian who finds new ways to complain
about the boyfriend who got away and her father's gift for inflicting
humiliation. Topics overlap, but each woman is distinctive. Sunda,
who goes by one name, does the only affectionate Cher impression. And
there is no one quite like Lahna Turner, who accompanies herself on
guitar as she sings original compositions guaranteed never to make it
into any other troubadour's repertoire. (That circumstance could
change if the demand for the ballad of a spermatozoon suddenly
increased.)</TE>
<TE>   This is not an open-mike night. Competition is heated for the
Wednesday night spots at the Laugh Factory. Several of these comics
have already appeared on late night television, although they're not
yet national headliners like Margaret Cho or Rita Rudner. Despite
Metal's promise, many of the performers aren't especially raunchy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to be dirty," says Sue Costello after her set. A
petite, blond 33-year old with a Boston accent, she's been doing
stand-up for 13 years. She's learned that a good act is as structured
as a concerto. "It takes 10 years to figure out who you are onstage,"
she says. "When I started out, I needed the people to approve of me.
Now I just enjoy myself, and when I'm in control, the crowd loves
it."</TE>
<TE>   Although much of Costello's routine is prepared, she isn't afraid
to scrap it. She's talking to a quintet of college seniors sitting
front and center when a man in the audience lobs a rude question. She
knows if she doesn't take charge, he could turn into Mr. Heckleman,
so she feigns shock, then focuses attention on him.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do?," she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a journalist," he replies.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, really? Who do you work for?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm independent."</TE>
<TE>   Costello has been given comic gold. "Oh, yeah," she tells the
audience. "He's homeless. I'm independent too. I'm an independent
superstar."</TE>
<TE>   Having dispensed with the interruption, she returns to the
students. The guys have come without dates, and they've already
become stars of the evening. Pleasantly surprised by how pretty
nearly all the comedians are, they didn't mind when Bertrand said
they were cute. Or when Costello cooed at them, acknowledging their
looks and the air of macho cool they exude.</TE>
<TE>   But at the end of the evening, their highest praise is reserved
for the last, least glamorous and crudest woman to take the stage:
rookie Marilyn Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   "She was gross," says Francisco Jordan, a 23-year-old UCLA
student. "And really funny. I'm coming back next week."</TE>

<LD>How many different kinds of flowers can you find in this painting? Do
you think they all bloom at the same time, the way you see them here?</LD>
<LD>   Roses, forget-me-nots, lillies of the valley, violets, hyacinths
and tulips don't bloom in the same season. The artist, Ambrosius
Bosschaert the Elder, lived in Holland in the early 1600s. He didn't
actually have this basket of flowers in front of him while he painted
"Flower Still Life." Instead, he worked from sketches made from
living flowers at different times of the year or from books
illustrated with images of flowers.</LD>
<LD>   Many Dutch people in the 1600s had a love for flowers. Those with
enough money paid artists to make pictures of their favorite ones. At
that time, the Dutch were especially fond of tulips. Can you find all
three tulips in the painting? In 1637, prices for unusual tulips
soared. One rare bulb sold for enough to buy a very grand home.
Thousands of people joined the tulip-growing business, hoping it
would be an easy way to get rich, but the craze for tulips didn't
last. Within a year, tulip bulbs were worth nothing.</LD>
<TE>   The Getty invites you to come to the museum and study Bosschaert's
"Flower Still Life" up close. Children 12 and younger who stop at the
information desk in the entrance hall will receive a free postcard of
the painting. For more information or parking reservations, call
(310) 440-7300 or visit www.getty.edu. Parking reservations are not
needed Saturdays and Sundays or after 4 p.m. weekdays.</TE>

<LD>"Now We're Talking"</LD>
<LD>   by Dean Hughes</LD>
<LD>   Do you like baseball? Do you like the excitement of a good game?
Ollie is a really good pitcher. His problem is when he pitches, he
talks--loudly! He basically tells the batter what kind of pitch to
expect. Then the batter whacks it. He tries to talk in his mind, but
he just can't. Ollie is sort of weird. His family is always on the
move. He never fits in even on a baseball team. To find out if he
fixes it, go to your local library and get the book.</LD>

<TE>   "I Thought My Soul Would Rise and Fly"</TE>
<TE>   by Joyce Hansen</TE>
<TE>   This book is the diary of a girl named Patsy. She was African
American and worked on a plantation called Davis Hall. Patsy was
taken from her family when she was just a baby, so she grew up in
Davis Hall until she was 18. The reason I chose this book to review
was because, at first, Patsy was scared and her mistress and master
were mean to her, but then she learned to speak up for herself.</TE>

<HD>Judith Leiber's New Designs Are Turning Up on Tables</HD>
<DH>At 80, the designer has launched a line of silver
accessories, which, like her handbags, often take the whimsical form
of animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNIE GROER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Judith Leiber built her career and fortune on exquisitely crafted
purses.</LD>
<LD>   By day, legions of well-dressed, well-heeled ladies who lunch,
marry and divorce advantageously or make their own way in the world,
thank you, toted her satchels and clutches of ostrich, lizard, snake,
alligator and calfskin.</LD>
<LD>   As night fell, the same fashion avatars brought out their Leiber
minaudieres--those too-tiny confections shaped, among other things,
like animals, vegetables, fruit and flowers--paved with thousands of
dazzling crystals and bearing four-figure price tags.</LD>
<TE>   Locked in glass cases at such high-end emporia as Saks Fifth
Avenue and Neiman-Marcus, where they were treated like fine jewelry
by sellers and buyers alike, the precious purses acquired cult
status.</TE>
<TE>   Today, nine years after selling her company and her name and
agreeing not to make competing bags, belts and jewelry, Leiber is
back in business, lavishing her love of design and detail on a
collection of  stylish,  expensive silver tabletop accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the sterling obelisk perched atop a quartet of turtles on
an onyx base--$2,200 for the 11-inch model, $2,870 for the
14-incher--and the matching obelisk salt and peppers ($675 per pair);
or the statuette of a gentleman ($2,750) whose onyx base replicates
that of companion candlesticks ($1,450 each).</TE>
<TE>   The collection is called Objets Ditty Peto, a brand that marries
her girlhood nickname and maiden name. The 25-piece line should hit
the market this fall in several tony boutiques, retailing from $140
for a single napkin ring to $4,040 for a woven basket.</TE>
<TE>   Leiber, 80, is aware of the perils of starting a luxury venture in
the midst of a recession. "It is a tough period right now; everybody
is very hesitant about a lot of things," she said during a recent
chat in her Park Avenue penthouse, furnished with a deft mix of
European and Asian antiques and art and numerous paintings by Gus
Leiber, her husband and business partner.</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted, however, that her timing has never been overly
auspicious. She began her career in her native Budapest during the
far-darker days of World War II, and introduced her first line of
Judith Leiber handbags just months before President Kennedy's
assassination.</TE>
<TE>   Circumstance drove young Ditty--a diminutive of Judith--to start
making purses more than 60 years ago, when Hitler's march across
Europe crushed the family plan that she study chemistry at King's
College London, with an eye to making cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   Trapped in Budapest without a trade, she applied to the handbag
guild and was the first woman  accepted as an apprentice. By war's
end (her Jewish family survived on forged papers), she was skilled in
every phase of production, from making glue to sewing delicate hides
to frames.</TE>
<TE>   After the armistice, she started selling her wares at the U.S.
legation because "no one else could afford my bags." She also met and
married Gus Leiber, a Brooklyn-born G.I. stationed in Hungary, and
sailed with him to America in 1946. There followed a series of jobs
in progressively finer Manhattan handbag factories.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, the Leibers started their own company in a tiny loft near
the Empire State Building. She oversaw the creative side; he ran the
business while continuing to paint and teach art. It was, she has
said, "a classic case of American entrepreneurship: husband and wife
in a start-up, very-low-capital situation during a downturn in
business when Kennedy was assassinated."</TE>
<TE>   But they managed to hang on, selling mostly leather bags to top
department stores.  In 1967, she produced her first gold-plated
evening purse.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt badly that a fashionable woman had to go to her safe to
get her genuine gold evening bag for a party," she recalled last
year, after receiving the Accessory Council's hall of fame award.
When the plating process proved defective, she covered the flaws with
paste-on crystals, creating an instant success.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly three decades, the business thrived. Leiber bags, an
estimated 3,000 to 4,000 designs, have been carried and, in some
cases collected or even curated, by fashionistas and first ladies
alike (Hillary Rodham Clinton owns a Socks cat version.)</TE>
<TE>   Then, she sold Judith Leiber Inc. to a luxury-timepiece
conglomerate. "I sold the business in 1993 and worked with them for
five years." When she grew bored-- "'You can't just sit around on
your heinie,' I told my husband"--she decided to switch to sterling
tableware. "I just got it all together. I had worked in brass because
we did mostly handbags in metal."</TE>
<TE>   The shift was easier for the well-connected Leiber than for a
novice: Though she lacked formal art training, she retained ties to
artisans who could translate her ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "I make rough sketches. Then I have a fellow who makes a perfect
sketch and makes the wax model. He is in New York. He used to make my
brass pieces. Basically, it's a similar feeling, doing an object."</TE>
<TE>   The models were sent to Florence, where silversmiths made
prototypes and shipped them back to Leiber. She sought some changes,
including hollowing out a solid, kneeling ram because it was too
heavy. Its hinged lid makes it the perfect container for sugar or
potpourri, she suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Animals represent about 40% of this collection, which will not
surprise devotees of Leiber's handbag menagerie: pandas and teddy
bears (same metal shape, different beading), horses and zebras
(ditto), mice, pigs, fish, frogs, cats and rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   The silver creatures include kittens, bunnies, snakes, snails,
ducks, frogs and turtles.</TE>
<TE>   "They are quite different from those I used to make," she said
emphatically; the lids on the new breeds, for example, flip up like
box tops, while the purses opened like clamshells.</TE>
<TE>   Leiber is hoping her "very big following"--that presumably
recession-proof stratum of consumers who think nothing of dropping
$2,500 or $3,000 on one of her purses--will spend just as freely on
her silver line. These women (and the occasional man) "understand
something that is elegant, nice, pricey and classy."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly David Levy, director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art,
appreciates her aesthetic. Come October, he is staging a
retrospective of Leiber bags, along with several sterling objects.
(Those who believe that when the going gets tough, the tough go
shopping can purchase select silver pieces in the gift shop.)</TE>
<TE>   He is clear about why he is showcasing Leiber's work. "She emerged
as a very special kind of designer and artist in an industry that is
kind of ho-hum," said Levy, a fervent champion of design. "Whether we
are talking about architecture, chairs, fashion or teapots, you can't
open your eyes in the morning and not deal with design."</TE>
<TE>   Fashion, he continued, happens to be "a tremendous preoccupation
of all people" yet "the least driven by functionality." Her bags "are
like jewels, little works of art."</TE>
<TE>   And the silver? "Here she is, 80 years old and off in a new
direction, and it's wonderful," said Levy. "The truth of the matter
is, it really talks about what it means to be an artist. She has made
a great deal of money, had a great deal of success. She is starting
something new and not trivial, something big. It says, 'Hey, I've got
to do this work.'"</TE>

<HD>Revisiting the Tragedy of the Sept. 11 Attacks</HD>

<LD>Thank you for staff writer Michael Quintanilla's "Of Tears, Tourists
and a Return to Ground Zero" (Feb. 24) on visiting ground zero. I,
too, was in New York recently and saw the almost carnival-like
atmosphere around the site. It was disturbing.</LD>
<LD>   However, someone who wasn't there on Sept. 11 cannot possibly
understand the depth of Quintanilla's feelings. Those of us who saw
the terrorist attacks unfolding on television were removed from the
events in a way those who were there can never be.</LD>
<LD>   In this sense, Quintanilla in his grief is also a victim of
terrorism. He has a right to be angry at cavalier attitudes of the
general public.</LD>
<TE>   Let me tell you what else I saw in New York. One morning, Fifth
Avenue was closed for three blocks around St. Patrick's Cathedral
while a funeral service was held for a police officer killed on Sept.
11. She left behind a husband and a 2-year-old daughter. The street
was filled with hundreds of off-duty police officers standing
together to honor one of their own. Perhaps I came across as cavalier
as I took photos of these officers, but their devotion touched me
deeply and it was a sight I will never forget.</TE>

<TE>   I found Michael Quintanilla's article very powerful. I have
appreciated all the Sept. 11 stories; please continue to find them
and print them. Reading each person's account of coping with the
aftermath of that day gives me courage to face my own feelings of
grief.</TE>

<TE>   Tribute to Father Strikes</TE>
<TE>   a Resonant Chord</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Mary McNamara's ode to her father ("An Ordinary Man,
an Extraordinary Dad and Friend," Feb. 26) had a universal pathos
that struck a resonant chord.</TE>
<TE>   My father died Jan. 7, and his funeral was pithy and attended by a
scant score of family and friends. The personal and professional
achievements that accrued over a lifetime were given a short litany
but the elan vital that was at the core of his being was rarely
noticed, much less acknowledged, by the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   Each person in the world has a contribution that is unique and
irreplaceable, and the story makes that point well. Thank you for
expressing in stentorian tones that which is usually whispered in sub
rosa conversations.</TE>

<TE>   Chastity Theory</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't Ring True</TE>
<TE>   I read staff writer Christine Frey's "For Real Singles, Chastity
Is Hardly the Tough Part" (March 4) and have to concur with her about
the reasons for not engaging in sex.</TE>
<TE>   However, I have a problem with sexologist Howard Ruppel's
assertion that the longer a person goes without, the less likely he
is to want it. Let him go without for the 4,700-odd days that I have
and see if he still feels that way.</TE>

<TE>   I'm a 35-year-old male, not quite Josh Hartnett, but I'm told I'm
good-looking.</TE>
<TE>   I too have been abstaining from sex. I'm not religious, I'm not
worried about sexually transmitted diseases and I have no moral
sexual blockade.</TE>
<TE>   Quite simply, I haven't met a person in a long time who interests
me. This theory that a man or woman will bust if they don't get some
regularly is pretty funny. It's nice to know somebody out there
besides me is still based in reality.</TE>

<HD>Having a Rolling Good Time</HD>
<DH>Skateboard Art, among other classes, was created out of
boredom over the usual kids activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Tuesday morning--not just any old Tuesday--but the Tuesday that
4-year-old Gabriel Speer of Hancock Park will glide like a big kid on
his very own self-designed skateboard.</LD>
<LD>   Gabriel is one of five kids who, for the last eight weeks, has
been hanging out at one of the coolest art classes around--called
Skateboard Art--found at Creative Space, a new spot for kids' classes
in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   That's where these Tony Hawk wannabes--ages 4 to 6--have designed
their own graphics to transform the underside of their once
whitewashed maple boards into works of art: a snow storm, a cat, a
turtle, "tribe" markings and an alligator, to be exact.</LD>
<TE>   "I like painting a lot," said Bennett DiDonna, a classmate of
Gabriel's who just turned 7 and the designer of the silver and green
alligator board. "I thought it would be fun to make my own
skateboard. I like reptiles a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Each week of the class has been devoted to one step in the
skateboard building and designing process, from reviewing other board
designs for inspiration, to penciling in their illustrations on their
boards to painting and varnishing them.</TE>
<TE>   But, by far, the toughest class of all was applying grip tape to
the boards. That's the sandpaper-like material found on the top of
the board that provides traction. Unfortunately, it's a cruel joke
that the paper manufactured for this purpose hangs about an inch too
wide on one side.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the cachet of making your own board is sawing that paper
down to size with a metal file. The kids did so for nearly an hour
with whatever might their preschool and kindergarten-sized muscles
could muster--after all, cutting grip tape with scissors would not be
cool.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to get the paper nice and smooth to the edge," yelled
out teacher Shari Cliver, 33, "so your board won't look amateurish.
Filing it gives your board a nice worn look."</TE>
<TE>   But now it's Tuesday--the last class--and the day Gabriel and his
classmates will finally equip the underside of their boards with
trucks, bearings and wheels, try to flip the tail of their boards
into a flying "ollie" and skate off into the California sunset, or at
least a skate park.</TE>
<TE>   "He got upset when I turned in the other direction away from
Creative Space this morning," said Gabriel's father, Chris Speer, 41.
"He just kept saying, 'Isn't today the day I finally get to ride my
board?' And I told him, 'Yes, but you'll have to go to school
first.'"</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was a good idea to have an art class that boys
could relate to," Cliver said. And it's worked.</TE>
<TE>   "Skateboarding is what drew him in," said Jessica Royer, mother of
Bailey, 5. "Now he's interested in the drawing and painting."</TE>
<TE>   Skateboard Art--for the preschool set to age 14-- is just one of
the 50 or so classes offered at Creative Space's lofty location at
Santa Monica Boulevard and Vine. There's something called "Fairy
School," in which kids assume a fairy identity, decide what magical
powers they possess and write a group storybook about their
make-believe experiences--a big hit with girls. There is
swashbuckling class and even a music appreciation class introducing
everything from the late Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to
Tevye's "If I Were a Rich Man" from "Fiddler on the Roof."</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't Gymboree," said Cheryl Bayer-Brady, co-founder of the
center and former senior vice president of comedy for Fox television.
"No, this is something entirely different." Bayer-Brady, 37, along
with Gayle Baigelman, 42, formerly a partner of filmmaker Norman
Jewison, dreamed up Creative Space last spring after sitting through
one too many boring kids' parties</TE>
<TE>   The two knew each other only in passing from their children's
elementary school. "But then our eyes met across the way at a party,"
said Baigelman. "We found each other as we looked past the stupid
Cowboy Bill character doing western lasso tricks, and that was it."</TE>
<TE>   The two spent the rest of the party lamenting the lack of
innovative children's programs in Los Angeles. Soon after, they got
in touch with another mom, Jennifer Barrett-Bernstein, a close friend
of Bayer-Brady's and the former creative director at Warner Home
Video, and met for coffee to commiserate.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for classes for our kids that just weren't out
there," said Barrett-Bernstein, 40.</TE>
<TE>   The three--each of whom had chosen to put off her career to spend
more time with her young children--were also looking for ways to stay
creative. An hour and a half and three iced mochas later, a
partnership was formed.</TE>
<TE>   Within three months, the trio created a business plan,
brainstormed classes, used their Hollywood connections to find talent
and finally opened Creative Space--using about $50,000 in credit
cards--last October.</TE>
<TE>   "We begged, borrowed and stole," joked Baigelman. "We financed
this thing like an independent movie."</TE>
<TE>   So far, so good. Classes are filling up with families from nearby
Hancock Park, Hollywood and Los Feliz. "We even have moms calling us
from Pacific Palisades," said Bayer-Brady. But the sessions don't
come cheap; the eight-week classes range from $160 to more than $400
when parents join in.</TE>
<TE>   Already the women are considering opening other locations in Los
Angeles or franchising out in such places as Chicago, Seattle, Las
Vegas and San Francisco. But how to prevent Creative Space from
becoming the very thing that, as parents, they disliked most? "This
started with passion, heart and soul, and it will stay that way,"
said Bayer-Brady. "How we can maintain the character of what we've
become," Baigelman added, "that will be the key to our success."</TE>

<LD>An argument broke out between Miss Baxter, the teacher, and her
sixth-graders.</LD>
<LD>   "You know," she said, "before coming to California I never heard
of the dumb custom of pinching on St. Patrick's Day if you aren't
wearing green. In my home state of Wisconsin, we celebrated in more
civil ways."</LD>
<LD>   "Well, my mom and dad heard of pinching for not wearing green, and
they weren't born in California," Gina boasted.</LD>
<TE>   "Mine, too," several others chimed in.</TE>
<TE>   "We could find out what people really do in other states,"
suggested Miss Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   Maria raised her hand. "My cousin lives in Illinois. I could write
to her and ask what they do."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's write to every state," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   "How will we do that?" asked Ronnie.</TE>
<TE>   "We can write to a chamber of commerce or city hall or board of
education and ask them to give our letter to a sixth-grader in their
city," answered Miss Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us will have to write to two states, since there are only
35 kids in this room and we have 50 states," Mike remarked.</TE>
<TE>   Students started drafting their letters.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Sixth-grader,</TE>
<TE>   My teacher says it's dumb to pinch for not wearing green on St.
Patrick's Day. We don't agree with her. What do they do where you
live? Please answer.</TE>
<TE>   A few other letters sounded more mature:</TE>
<TE>   Dear Sixth-graders,</TE>
<TE>   Our class is conducting a survey of the whole nation to find out
how St. Patrick's Day is observed. We hope to hear from every state
so we can make comparisons and compile the results.</TE>
<TE>   In California, students pinch others who are not wearing green. We
are not sure how this custom started. Please write and tell us how
you celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: What will they hear from the other states?</TE>
<TE>   Betty Martens is a retired teacher. She still has the booklet her
students compiled after doing a similar survey. This story will be on

<HD>An American Puts a Different Spin on Iran's 'Axis' Image</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For another view of Iran, the country President Bush has reduced to
an "axis of evil," along with Iraq and North Korea, Terence Ward
refers you to his new book, "Searching for Hassan." Just released by
Houghton Mifflin, the book is part cultural history and part travel
memoir, but most of all it is Ward's impression of a country that he
shows is far more subtle than what most Westerners know. "It's easy
to reconfirm myths," he says, "but harder to show the other side of
the coin. I wanted to give a deeper understanding of the culture."</LD>
<LD>   An Irish American with coppery red hair, Ward, 48, was born in
Colorado but lived in Tehran from 1960 to 1969 along with his parents
and three brothers. His father worked as an economic advisor to the
National Iranian Oil Co. and moved the family to the Middle East when
Ward was 6. The experience set Terence off on a life of travel; he
has since lived in Cairo, Geneva and Bali and worked as a management
consultant in a number of Arab countries. He and his wife, Idanna,
now divide their time between New York and Florence, Italy.</LD>
<TE>   Terence Ward, his brothers and their elderly parents returned to
Iran in 1998, 30 years after leaving, to find a country far different
from the one they left behind. The booming oil industry, the
extravagant ways of the ruling Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a society
attracted to the West yet steeped in ancient Persian roots, all had
been shrouded in Islamic fundamentalism.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the trip was to track down the family's beloved cook,
Hassan Ghasemi, with whom they had lost touch. The search led the
Wards from Shiraz north to Tehran, with plenty of side trips in
between. Early on, they learned that Hassan left Tehran soon after
they moved away. Ward's mother, Donna, vaguely remembered that his
hometown was Tudeshk, north of the city, but that was all they had to
go on.</TE>
<TE>   From the first pages of the book, it is obvious why the Wards
missed Hassan, who had been far more than the family cook. Part
genie, part sage, he taught the brothers to leap over fire at the new
year festival and to negotiate the price of pomegranates at the local
bazaar. He played his sehtar, a small mandolin, for them and wept as
he told them Persian legends about kings and warriors. When the
summer heat settled on Tehran like a warm woolen blanket, Ward
writes, Hassan made an annual announcement. "From now on we sleep
under the stars."</TE>
<TE>   "We were not even sure we would find Hassan," Ward says on a
recent visit to Los Angeles. "The book became a larger quest, a way
to explore the culture and the sweep of Iran's history."</TE>
<TE>   Finding Hassan was not easy, but the Wards finally did have their
reunion, in Isfahan, where Hassan, his wife and two grown children
now live. A week of feasting on dishes laced with saffron, parties
with friends and relatives of their "Persian father" and
conversations with Hassan about the disillusionment among Iranians
all had a strong effect on Ward. "We were cheering," Hassan said of
the days following the fall of the shah. "They told us Iran will
become like heaven. But then the war [with Iraq] comes. We have to
fight crazy Saddam [Hussein]. So many die."</TE>
<TE>   Such conversations gave Ward his focus: "The book became a way to
explore universal themes of family, friends, loyalty, the crossing of
barriers," he says. "That's where I took the experience."</TE>
<TE>   As a travel memoir, Ward's story crosses back and forth from the
old culture to the modern one. Tours of the ancient Persian capital
of Persepolis, the tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Jewish
synagogue in Shiraz, the carpet dealers' stalls in the bazaar of
Isfahan are spiced with details about the engaging Ward family. In
Shiraz, his brothers bargained for cherry juices at the corner store
while Ward and his mother visited the synagogue. A community of about
500 Iranian Jews still live in the city.</TE>
<TE>   In Yazd, Ward's mother observed that people now look healthier
than they used to, and pointed out that the extremes of wealth and
poverty appear to have balanced out since the shah was deposed. "It's
critical to understand Iran in context," Ward says. "Then we can see
what this culture and others have in common."</TE>
<TE>   A mismatched pair of guides accompanied the family on their
travels. Akbar, an articulate companion, led them to places that are
the pride of many Iranians. In the village of Pasargadae he showed
them a declaration from 539 BC by King Cyrus, founder of the Persian
Empire, after his invasion of Babylon. "I ordered that all should be
free to worship their god with no harm. I ordered that no one's home
be destroyed and no one's property be taken." The statement seems
more poignant given the country's current reputation for intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Avo, the second guide, was a nonnegotiable addition to the trip
supplied by the government. A source of comic misinformation, he once
explained that the substance at the top of Mt. Elburz, near Tehran,
was salt. The Wards had skied there, in the snow.</TE>
<TE>   Storytellers, humorists, myth makers, the cast of Iranian
characters continued to grow as the trip unfolded. "Iran was the
first home I ever knew," Ward says. "I wanted to shed light on the
country, the wonderful sense of humor, the rich cultural history." It
is not a perfect place, but in prying it free from the rest of the
Middle East, he shows the country in all its complexity. Most
Westerners would hardly recognize it.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, America's reaction to Iran has been mostly one of
anger and mistrust. The revolution there in 1979, the rise of
Khomeini, the taking of American Embassy workers as hostages, the
banners that read "Death to America" gave an accurate but incomplete
picture. Ward describes a more intricate image of a nation caught in
a tug of war with itself. Modern Iran is cosmopolitan, worldly,
refined by its ancient Persian influences, even as it is wrapped in
conservative, volatile Islam.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks of touring with his book, Ward has met dozens of
Iranian expatriates in Los Angeles. Over a cold drink in a friend's
living room, he wonders at the responses he has had to his book.
Among them is a growing collection of e-mail bursting with heartfelt
messages.</TE>
<TE>   "So many Iranians who left the country during the revolution have
had the experience of leaving someone behind and losing contact," he
says. "They want to go back and find the person they have missed."</TE>
<TE>   As an outsider looking in, he says, he has been welcomed. "I am
someone who is not Iranian writing with admiration about them. They
are not accustomed to it."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way he has made a mental list of the most often heard
mistakes about Iran. People think it is an Arab country, they don't
realize that it is Persian, and has its own language, Farsi, and its
own culture. They confuse Iran with Iraq, the home of chemical
weapons plants and President Saddam Hussein, who invaded Iran in
1980. "I sometimes call the U.S. the United States of Amnesia," Ward
says. "It's up to those who know the difference to create a dialogue
about the other side of Iran's story."</TE>
<TE>   Among the misunderstandings, one stands out. "Iran is one of the
most pro-West countries in the Middle East," Ward discovered on his
trip. But at the same time, it is staunchly opposed to the West, as a
result of its two-pronged government. President Mohammad Khatami was
elected by a popular vote and wants to establish better relations
with the West while the un-elected government, made up of Islamic
clerics, blocks openness and has the upper hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent polls in Iran show that 80% of the country wants change,"
Ward says. There were candlelight vigils there after the Sept. 11
attacks on the U.S. At the same time, people are afraid to speak out
against the Islamic stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   The Iran the Wards left behind 30 years ago was not the sealed-off
Islamic state the country has become. Nor was it a truly open
society. At the Community School in Tehran, for the children of
diplomats and foreign business executives, Terence Ward went to class
with Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Christians and Jews as well as Muslims. But
his father would tell him about the men who did not return to work
after they criticized the shah's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, the landscape is changing again. Ward met taxi drivers,
waiters and rug merchants who told him how they cope with today's
fierce politics. "When Khomeini ruled Iran, we called the U.S. 'The
Great Satan,'" one said. "Now, they call us the 'Axis of Evil.' So,
we're even."</TE>
<TE>   At Beyond Baroque, an arts center in Venice, Ward shows slides of
his trip to an audience of people with family ties in the Middle
East. From a rickety projector, he flashes snapshots of enclosed
gardens and dainty fountains, ancient palaces and golden-domed
mosques, an outdoor teahouse, one of Hassan's feasts spread out on a
floral carpet.</TE>
<TE>   Fuzzy and out of focus at times, the images still had the power to
dissolve the audience in sighs of delight.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fate is tied to every soul living on the other side of the
planet," he says. That is reason enough for Westerners to learn more
about the land of mullahs and shahs.</TE>
<TE>   "In the future," Ward says, "to save our children we must also
save theirs."</TE>

<HD>Argentina Pleads for Renewed Aid</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Neighboring nations express concern that the
crisis will deepen and affect their economies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>FORTALEZA, Brazil</DL>
<LD>Argentina pleaded for renewed international financial help Sunday to
overcome its deep economic crisis, warning of more social and
political upheaval if rescue loans are not forthcoming.</LD>
<LD>   "To overcome the crisis sooner, we need the support of the
international community, not just with words but with loans and
funds," Argentine Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov said.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, the crisis will deepen and the government may not
survive to the September elections, Remes told international
investors and finance officials from across the hemisphere at the
annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank.</LD>
<TE>   "It is continuity or anarchy. That is the risk we see," Deputy
Economy Minister Jorge Todesca told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Finance ministers from other Latin American nations, keen to avoid
financial turbulence spreading to their economies, backed Argentina's
call for assistance from the International Monetary Fund and other
lending agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF last week reopened negotiations with Argentina, whose new
government has floated the peso currency and begun to lift controls
imposed last year to avoid a run on the banks.</TE>
<TE>   Remes and Todesca met with U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for
International Affairs John Taylor, who praised the changes Argentina
is making.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a good set of meetings and exchanged information about a
number of things," Taylor said. "There certainly have been a lot of
talks and a lot of good discussions with the IMF, and the [Argentine]
Central Bank is making good changes."</TE>
<TE>   Executives of private international banks facing major losses in
Argentina said they felt encouraged after hearing Remes lay out his
game plan for recovery in South America's second-largest economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the bankers said they were far from knowing whether Argentina
will be viable enough for them to continue operating in the country,
where their assets were hit by devaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are going in the right direction, but we are still a long
way from knowing whether the system is viable or not, and whether it
is feasible to continue operating there," said an executive of a
European bank.</TE>
<TE>   The source said a lot will hinge on an agreement with the IMF on
an economic program that will unblock $9 billion remaining from a
rescue package granted to Argentina last year.</TE>
<TE>   That program was suspended in November because of Argentina's
failure to control spending and reduce its fiscal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Argentina declared default on its $141-billion public
debt, amid banking restrictions that angered the public and set off
protests that ousted two presidents in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The peso has lost half its value since devaluation in January.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's economic output, pummeled by financial crisis and a
four-year recession, will shrink dramatically in the first half of
this year but will return to growth in the last two quarters, Todesca
predicted.</TE>

<HD>Buffett Posts Negative Outlook in Annual Letter</HD>
<DH>Investments: The billionaire says the war on terror cannot
be won and criticizes overpaid executives at ailing companies. He
sees weak stock market returns in the next few years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL RIGBY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett issued a pessimistic outlook on
the world, saying the war on terror could never be won--a potential
problem for his insurance interests--and warning that returns from
the stock market over the next few years look meager.</LD>
<LD>   Buffett also said 2001 earnings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the
insurance and investment company he controls, fell 76% as it absorbed
losses from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the recession.</LD>
<LD>   Buffett, known as the "Oracle of Omaha" for his astute
investments, also blasted executives for taking millions of dollars
out of businesses even as they fare badly, a practice he said went
far beyond Enron Corp., the collapsed energy trader.</LD>
<TE>   Buffett, 71, second only to Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates among the
world's multibillionaires, made his remarks in his annual letter to
shareholders of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was published on the company's Web site (www
.berkshirehathaway.com) Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Omaha-based Berkshire--a group of 50 or so operating companies,
chiefly in insurance, that generate money for Buffett to invest--had
a tough year in 2001. It reported drastically lower net profit, cut
by a whopping $2.4 billion in claims from the Sept. 11 destruction of
the World Trade Center by two hijacked airliners.</TE>
<TE>   The company's net income fell to $795 million, or $521 a share,
from $3.3 billion, or $2,185 a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire reported realized gains of $842 million, compared with
$2.4 billion a year ago. Berkshire posted an operating loss of $47
million, compared with profit of $936 million.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett said that further terror attacks on the United States were
possible and must be accounted for by insurers.</TE>
<TE>   "Fear may recede with time, but the danger won't," Buffett said.
"The war against terrorism can never be won. The best the nation can
achieve is a long succession of stalemates."</TE>
<TE>   Working on that assumption, Buffett said his reinsurance
operations, including General Re--the largest reinsurer in the United
States--would underwrite only some coverage for terrorist attacks,
including some third-party liability coverage for airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett once again called on the government to back up insurers
covering terror risks, though that seems unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "Only the U.S. government has the resources to absorb such a
blow," Buffett said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is unwilling to do so on a prospective basis, the general
citizenry must bear its own risks and count on the government to come
to its rescue after a disaster occurs."</TE>
<TE>   That essentially means that without government support, insurers
will exclude terror coverage in most policies, a trend that already
is hurting policyholders, especially in real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett saw the size of his stock portfolio plummet last year, to
about $29 billion from nearly $38billion the year before, mostly
because of wilting prices.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett's major long-standing holdings, including American Express
Co. and Coca-Cola Co., lost billions of dollars in value.</TE>
<TE>   "Our restrained enthusiasm for these securities is matched by
decidedly lukewarm feelings about the prospects for stocks in general
over the next decade or so," Buffett said in his letter, on behalf of
himself and business partner Charlie Munger.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's equity prices presage only moderate returns for
investors," Buffett warned those  looking for outsize returns. "The
market outperformed business for a very long period, and that
phenomenon had to end. A market that no more than parallels business
progress, however, is likely to leave many investors disappointed,
particularly those relatively new to the game."</TE>
<TE>   Buffett also returned to a favorite theme--the shabby ethics of
many businesses in the United States--encapsulated by the tech bubble
and the fall of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlie and I are disgusted by the situation, so common in the
last few years, in which shareholders have suffered billions in
losses while the CEOs, promoters and other higher-ups who fathered
these disasters have walked away with extraordinary wealth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett repeated his long-held promise that he will never sell any
of his 31% share in Berkshire, taking the rough with the smooth along
with other shareholders. Buffett's stake in Berkshire is worth about
$34 billion, which he says is 99% of his net worth.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these people were urging investors to buy shares while
concurrently dumping their own, sometimes using methods that hid
their actions," Buffett said, making an implicit criticism of Enron.
"To their shame, these business leaders view shareholders as patsies,
not partners."</TE>
<TE>   Enron has become the symbol for shareholder abuse, Buffett said,
but "there is no shortage of egregious conduct elsewhere in corporate
America."</TE>

<HD>IRS Targets Records of Credit Card Companies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RYAN J. DONMOYER</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service's recent success in gaining access to
the accounts of tax evaders who use American Express and MasterCard
to spend money banked in offshore accounts may lead to requests for
similar information from other credit card companies, tax experts
said.</LD>
<LD>   The tax agency is finishing court-ordered negotiations with
American Express Co. and MasterCard International Inc. to learn
identifying information such as passport and driver's license numbers
of customers with accounts in the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, and
Antigua and Barbuda.</LD>
<LD>   Once those negotiations are finished, the IRS could go after
accounts held by other credit card companies, such as Visa
International Inc. and Citigroup's Diners Club International, said
former IRS officials.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be reasonable to conclude that the IRS is not only
focusing on just two credit card companies," said Margaret Milner
Richardson, an IRS commissioner during the Clinton administration who
practices tax law at Ernst &amp; Young. The IRS didn't say why it went
after only American Express and MasterCard in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   IRS spokesman Frank Keith would not say what action the agency
would take next. "The IRS will continue to be working to identify
taxpayers who evade taxes through the use of offshore trusts," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Americans who use offshore accounts at banks such as Suisse
Security Bank &amp; Trust in Nassau, the Bahamas, and Barrington Bank in
St. John's, Antigua, cost the U.S. Treasury $70 billion to $300
billion in lost revenue annually, witnesses told the Senate Finance
Committee last year.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS wants access to credit cards linked to those accounts to
track big-ticket purchases by Americans, hoping to detect unreported
income and find Americans who aren't filing tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS considers all income by U.S. citizens to be taxable, and
assets in foreign banks must be declared on tax returns. Offshore
accounts are widely advertised as a way to shelter income in
countries with tough bank secrecy laws.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of offshore bank accounts and offshore entities to
facilitate tax evasion is a massive problem for the United States,"
said an affidavit filed in a U.S. District Court case that forced
American Express and MasterCard to turn over customer account
information to the IRS. The affidavit was submitted by Jack Blum, a
former Senate investigator and expert on money laundering who's now a
partner in the Washington law firm of Lobel, Novins &amp; Lamont.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS says thousands of Americans use credit and debit cards to
spend their money in offshore bank accounts without leaving a paper
trail in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The government in October 2000 convinced a judge in Miami that
American Express and MasterCard must provide documents for
transactions in 1998-1999 because the companies process all offshore
card transactions in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Since the judge's ruling, the tax collection agency has been
negotiating with both companies on the release of the records. At
issue is how American Express and MasterCard can honor privacy they
guarantee their customers while complying with a judge's order.</TE>

<HD>Allied Irish Banks  to Dismiss Managers</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allied Irish Banks is expected to dismiss senior managers this week
at its scandal-hit U.S. unit Allfirst, where rogue trader John Rusnak
ran up losses of nearly $700 million, it was reported.</LD>
<LD>   The Business newspaper of London said Allfirst Chairman Frank
Bramble as well as the Maryland bank's chief executive, Susan
Keating, would resign. Rusnak's immediate bosses, Bob Wray and David
Cronin, the head of Allfirst's treasury team, also were expected to
be fired. Both men were suspended in February when the losses,
totaling $691 million and accumulated over several years, were
revealed.</LD>
<LD>   The newspaper said Michael Buckley, Allied Irish chief executive,
would not resign.</LD>
<TE>   A report on the trading scandal, led by former U.S. Comptroller of
the Currency Eugene Ludwig, was handed to Allied Irish Chairman
Loclann Quinn on Saturday, the newspaper said. It will go to the
board on Tuesday and a public statement from the bank is expected on
Wednesday, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   An Allied Irish spokesman said the bank had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. trader at the center of the foreign exchange dealing
scandal has refused to be interviewed by the inquiry into the affair
by Allied Irish.</TE>
<TE>   Rusnak is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, with which he is said to be cooperating. Through his
lawyers, he has denied stealing money and has not been charged with
any crime.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said Rusnak had acted on legal advice in refusing an
interview with Ludwig, the independent head of the inquiry, casting
doubt on the validity of the inquiry's report.</TE>
<TE>   The eagerly awaited report's findings could influence whether
rival Bank of Ireland prepares a bid for Allied Irish.</TE>

<HD>Market Braces for Triple Witching</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing conviction that the nation's economy and corporate profits
are gathering strength will take on a life of its own this week,
perhaps pushing stocks up as investors worry they'll miss out on the
rally.</LD>
<LD>   With no blockbuster earnings reports expected and with economic
data expected to show consumer spending improving, Wall Street's
optimism may persuade more investors to ready their portfolios for a
rebound.</LD>
<LD>   Tensions are running high, analysts warn, as investors remember a
string of false rallies over the last two years. Concern that stock
prices are getting stretched and worry over unforeseen events will
keep a lid on gains.</LD>
<TE>   "Let's remember: We are one headline on the tape away from having
the market be in a bad way again." said Charles White, president of
Avatar Associates. "That probably will keep the euphoria in the
market down a bit."</TE>
<TE>   This week's triple witching--the simultaneous expiration of
futures, options contracts and index contracts--will make for a
seesaw market, but stocks should end the week higher.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department will release retail sales
for February, which are expected to rise 0.9%, reversing a dip of
0.2% in January.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, the government will report January figures on business
inventories, and on Friday the government is slated to release
producer prices--prices charged at the factory door and farm gate.</TE>

<HD>Hearings Open on Refunds for Power Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. and other power sellers are set to begin telling a judge
why they should not have to pay $1.5 billion in refunds to California
power sellers for electricity sold during the state's power crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Bruce Birchman opens a
hearing on the issue today. He'll recommend in August whether FERC
should require refunds be paid to power buyers in the state, where
prices quadrupled from January to June 2001. State officials say
power sellers inflated prices. Sellers say an electricity shortage
boosted costs.</LD>
<LD>   The commission directed Birchman in July to consider whether
refunds for electricity sales from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20,
2001, are due and how much. California power buyers, including
utilities owned by PG&amp;E Corp. and Edison International, are seeking
about $1.5 billion, said Stan Berman, a lawyer for PG&amp;E.</LD>
<TE>   The first part of the hearing, through Friday in Washington, will
include testimony on how the parties think possible refunds should be
calculated. The proceeding is set to conclude June 21.</TE>
<TE>   The commission wants refunds to be based on the formula it
established when it set a price cap for California in April and 10
other Western states in June. It's based on the cost of operating the
least-efficient generator in California.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Canada Face Lumber-Deal Deadline</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. and Canadian negotiators were working through the weekend on
ways to break an impasse over softwood lumber trade, but may fall
short of their goal of reaching a deal, even an interim one, by this
week, a Canadian source said.</LD>
<LD>   It is very probable there will not be a deal when the prime
minister comes to Washington, said the Canadian source, who asked not
to be identified.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. and Canadian government officials were not available for
comment.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and President
Bush are to meet in Washington to discuss several issues, including
the thorny softwood lumber dispute. Both governments had been hoping
Chretien and Bush could announce a deal at the end of their meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries, which have the world's largest bilateral
trading relationship, have been arguing over lumber trade for
decades. Their dispute worsened last April after a five-year deal
limiting Canada's shipments of softwood lumber to the United States
expired.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. lumber industry promptly filed grievances against Canada,
accusing it of using unfair government subsidies to dump about $6
billion worth of softwood lumber in the United States each year. The
cheap wood, they said, resulted in several permanent mill closings.</TE>
<TE>   Canada denies it is shipping lumber to the United States in
violation of trade rules.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Commerce Department agreed with the U.S. industry's
allegations and slapped countervailing and anti-dumping duties on
Canada's wood, which is used extensively for home building and
remodeling. Together, the duties average about 32%.</TE>
<TE>   Canada has protested the duties to the World Trade Organization.
At the same time, it has engaged in negotiations with the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   If no deal is reached by Thursday, negotiators from both sides are
expected to continue working, with March 21 providing another
pressure point in the talks.</TE>

<HD>AHP to Change Name to Wyeth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Home Products Corp. has solved its identity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   After selling well-known food businesses, four medical device
companies and its agricultural products division to focus on
prescription drugs and consumer health care, AHP found its name,
still little known, just didn't fit.</LD>
<LD>   So, as of today, the Madison, N.J.-based company is swapping its
moniker of the last 76 years for one much older: Wyeth.</LD>
<TE>   It's a name familiar mostly to doctors, for AHP's huge
Wyeth-Ayerst pharmaceuticals division and for one of the oldest U.S.
prescription medicine businesses, John Wyeth &amp; Brother, founded in
1860 and bought by American Home in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   "The company appears to be returning to its roots," said Mike
Krensavage, a drug industry analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Essner, 54, who became president and chief executive last
May, sees the name change as the final step in a metamorphosis.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: moving from a second-tier player to the No. 7
pharmaceutical company, based on U.S. sales, since 1999, with no
short-term threat from generic competition, unlike many big drug
makers, and seeing growth of prescription drug sales climb from 50%
of all revenue a decade ago to about 80%.</TE>

<HD>Free Trade Support Waning in Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When President Bush imposed tariffs against foreign steel last week,
he exempted Brazil's steel industry to drum up support there for one
of his objectives: the Free Trade Area of the Americas.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Zoellick, the U.S. trade representative, will find when he
visits Brazil this week to build on that effort that Bush's gesture
failed, Brazilian government and industry representatives said.</LD>
<LD>   "I would be very surprised if Brazil were at all amenable to
serious FTAA negotiations, much less taking a leadership role," said
William Barringer, the lawyer who represented Brazilian steelmakers,
including Companhia Siderurgica Nacional and Companhia Siderurgica de
Tubarao, during a U.S. investigation of imports.</LD>
<TE>   Bush put tariffs of up to 30% on most steel imports. He did not
put a quota on steel slab, the raw material used by U.S.
steel-rolling mills that is imported mostly from Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he set a quota for slab, giving Brazil a 2.8-million-ton
limit on slab shipments, equal to the country's 1999 highest-ever
export level.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil and the U.S. do about $30billion a year in two-way trade,
of which less than $2 billion is steel, according to U.S. Commerce
Department data.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. trade official, briefing reporters ahead of Zoellick's trip
on condition of not being named, said the need for Brazilian
leadership in the Americas trade negotiations played a part in
deciding to mitigate the effect of the steel action on the country's
industry.</TE>

<HD>Seafood Industry to Discuss Bioterrorism</HD>

<LD>The threat of terrorism is affecting even the nation's seafood
industry and its largest trade show.</LD>
<LD>   Some 20,000 people gather this week in Boston at the International
Seafood Show for industry gossip, talk of the latest technology and
trends, and networking.</LD>
<LD>   But the convention also will feature discussions on the
vulnerability of the nation's food supply, particularly seafood, and
the effects of new regulations.</LD>
<TE>   Some experts worry that the industry could be susceptible because
raw fish is a ready breeding ground for bacteria and because the
industry comprises numerous small companies, which makes oversight
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   A bioterrorism bill passed by the Senate in December provides for
stronger federal oversight of the seafood industry, requiring federal
registration of processing plants and authorizing the Food and Drug
Administration to seize catches in an emergency. A conference
committee is trying to resolve differences between the House and
Senate versions.</TE>
<TE>   The industry insists safety is its priority, but there are worries
that its many small businesses also could be vulnerable to
over-regulation. The industry plans a panel discussion on the issue
Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help each other
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer is a summary of discussions at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I started a small design business three years ago, and
it's been a struggle since day one. I regularly work 80-hour weeks,
the business has drained almost all our financial resources, and it's
putting a real strain on my marriage. Although my husband initially
supported me, he is growing increasingly resentful of my
preoccupation with the business. I don't want to lose my marriage,
but if I cut back now all my hard work will go down the drain. How
can I get him to understand this is just a phase every new business
has to go through?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: They say that starting a business is like having a baby.
The demands of getting a fledgling company off the ground require a
seemingly endless reservoir of cash, energy, time and patience. When
getting past the survival phase takes longer than expected, however,
even the strongest of marriages are put to the test.</LD>
<TE>   As in all family-owned businesses, there are always two sets of
issues--what's best for the business and what's best for the family.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, said Jo Hunt, president of DeLyon-Hunt &amp; Associates
in Redondo Beach, the time has come to step back and reassess your
initial business plan and the viability of the business.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start a business, it always takes longer and costs more
than you expect," Hunt said. "However, if you continually fall short
of expectations, you need to revisit your initial business plan and
come up with a different and more realistic set of goals and
objectives. More important, you need to set a deadline and make a
commitment--to yourself and to your husband--that if the company
doesn't at least reach the break-even point by the deadline, you will
pull the plug.</TE>
<TE>   "The harsh reality is that the business may never make money, and
you can't keep chasing the rainbow forever. At some point you have to
accept the inevitable and move on to something else. Having a
deadline and specific targets can make that decision a bit easier,
but in the long run both you and your marriage will be better off by
drawing a line in the sand and refusing to cross it."</TE>
<TE>   That takes care of the business side, but what about the family?
Having a revised forecast and a clear end in sight may not be enough
to quell the uprising on the home front.</TE>
<TE>   To reconnect with your husband, Wes Phillips, CEO of Hunter Barth
Advertising in Costa Mesa, suggested scheduling time with him as part
of your regular planning process.</TE>
<TE>   "Start by planning the time you will spend together, so that you
can fit it into the flow of your business rather than trying to grab
it piecemeal," Phillips said. "On the first of each month, sit down
and schedule time and activities together away from the business. Of
course, emergencies and unforeseen events will always come up, but do
your best to stick to the schedule and, when possible, make up for
any cancellations.</TE>
<TE>   "Try this approach for two or three months. If it doesn't work,
seek the help of a professional coach or counselor who can help you
work together better as a couple. If your husband balks at the idea
of counseling, at least do it yourself. If you don't take care of
yourself, you will never be able to take care of the business."</TE>
<TE>   The key to scheduling time with your husband is to make it quality
time, said Carri Johnston, president of Pep Threads in Orange. That
means making discussions about the business off limits during your
time together.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started my business many years ago, I constantly turned to
my husband for counsel, advice and support," Johnston said. "Night
and day, all I talked about was the business. I had no idea how much
it affected my husband until one day he looked me in the eye and said
very bluntly, 'Honey, I think you love that business more than me.'
That served as a real wake-up call, and we managed to work things out
before my commitment to the business wrecked our marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "When you schedule time together, talk about anything but the
business. If you need advice, seek outside help. Find a mentor, join
a CEO group or hire a consultant, but don't keep burdening your
husband with your business problems. As soon as the business allows,
hire some additional people and delegate as much as you can. Your
marriage can't survive the business unless you do."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>China's government ordered mobile-phone makers to increase production
of handsets to help China United Telecommunications Corp. expand use
of a new wireless network based on technology developed by Qualcomm
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The government ordered 12 of the 19 licensed makers of
code-division multiple access, or CDMA, cell phones to have 700,000
units ready by early May, according to manufacturers who attended a
government meeting last week and asked not to be identified.</LD>
<LD>   Qualcomm, which charges licensing fees for use of its standard and
sells chips based on those patents, fought for a decade to get a CDMA
network built in China.</LD>
<TE>   China United, with 28 million customers, has only 439,000 users on
its CDMA network, blaming slow growth on a handset shortage.</TE>

<HD>Mobile Phone Sales Show First Decline</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global mobile phone sales dipped below 400 million units in 2001, the
first decline in the history of the industry, which recently has seen
a reshuffle among second-tier manufacturers, research group Gartner
Dataquest said.</LD>
<LD>   Overall sales to consumers declined by 3.2% to 399.6 million
mobile phones in the full year, a marked difference from the 60%
average growth rate from 1996 to 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Sales were hurt by saturated markets in Europe, the removal of
subsidies by telecom operators, a burgeoning secondhand market in
developing countries and a gray market of unlisted imports from
overstocked distributors wanting to reduce inventories, said senior
Gartner analyst Bryan Prohm.</LD>
<TE>   On top of that, handset makers and operators failed to introduce
new features that could persuade consumers to replace their handsets
with new, more expensive ones. Meanwhile, the slowing economy crimped
consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   Market leader Nokia recovered all ground it had lost earlier in
the year. The Finnish company ended the year with a 35% market share,
up from 30.6% in 2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A congressional panel gave the nod last week to a bill that would set
up a zone on the Internet free of violence, pornography or other
material deemed inappropriate for children.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would direct the operator of the ".us" Internet domain to
set up a ".kids" subdomain for Web sites targeting children younger
than 13.</LD>
<LD>   Parents would find it easier to screen out sex or violence online
by setting their browsers to view only Web sites with addresses
ending in ".kids.us," said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), whose
telecommunications subcommittee unanimously approved the bill.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be like a safe playground with fences around it, Upton
said. "This really is no different from the children's section at the
public library."</TE>
<TE>   Upton said he would push for the full Energy and Commerce
Committee to take up the bill by the end of this month.</TE>

<HD>Economists See Recovery Faster Than Anticipated</HD>
<DH>Survey: Optimistic forecasters say first-quarter growth may
be at the fastest pace in almost two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy is breaking out of recession with unexpected speed
and may grow at a 3.7% rate in the second half of this year,
according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey.</LD>
<LD>   The consensus forecast calls for gross domestic product to
increase in the first quarter of this year at a 2.6% annual rate,
compared with 1.6% in last month's forecast. The most optimistic
economists said first-quarter growth would exceed 4%, the fastest
pace in almost two years. The economy grew at a 1.4% rate in the
fourth quarter of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "The majority of forecasters have been blindsided by the continued
strength in consumer spending, and more recently, by tentative signs
that business investment in equipment and software has begun to
recover," the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. are among retailers whose
sales have risen this year as their low-priced merchandise lured
buyers. Auto sales also have held up better than expected, helped by
cash rebates.</TE>
<TE>   A 3.7% growth rate in the third and fourth quarters would follow a
projected 3.2% pace in the second quarter. The economy grew 1.2% last
year, when the U.S. went into recession, and contracted at a 1.3%
rate in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   For 2002 as a whole, the economy probably will grow 2%, the March
survey showed. That's a half percentage point faster than last
month's estimate and twice as fast as December's forecast. The
economy grew 4.1% in 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The rebound, which just three months ago was expected to barely
get going in the first quarter, probably will keep unemployment from
rising much more. The jobless rate will peak at 5.9% in the
April-June period and fall to 5.8% by the end of the year, according
to the consensus of 52 forecasts in the survey. Unemployment was 5.5%
in February.</TE>
<TE>   The strength of the recovery helps explain why the economists in
this month's survey predict that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and his colleagues will raise interest rates in August or
September. The Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee probably will
say even sooner that the risks to the economy remain balanced between
inflation and weak growth.</TE>

<HD>Fund Plans to Vote Against HP Merger</HD>
<DH>Deals: Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan says the proposed
acquisition of Compaq would hurt shareholder value.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan said it will vote its Hewlett-Packard
Co. shares against the computer maker's proposed $22-billion
acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp. because it believes the union
would hurt shareholder value.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed transaction lacks merit and would increase HP's
exposure to a "troubled PC hardware business," the fund, which owns
1.46 million HP shares, said in a statement Sunday. The agreement
would dilute investors' stake in the company's profitable imaging and
printing business significantly, said the Toronto-based pension plan.</LD>
<LD>   "How many of these mega-mergers have really added value for the
shareholders?" fund Chief Executive Claude Lamoureux said. "All the
studies that one can see on this topic show that easily 60%, 70% or
80% of these mergers don't produce the kinds of benefits expected."</LD>
<TE>   The fund joins other major shareholders that have said they will
vote against the purchase. These include the California Public
Employees' Retirement System, which disclosed its intention Friday,
and members of HP's founding families, including board member Walter
Hewlett, who is leading a proxy fight against the acquisition. The
heirs own 18% of the company's shares. A shareholder vote is set for
March 19.</TE>
<TE>   The pension fund has about $44.1 billion in assets. Its stake
equals 0.08% of HP's shares outstanding and represents 0.07% of the
fund's holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed, but we believe that the good judgment of the
rest of our shareowners will prevail, and the merger will be
approved," said Rebeca Robboy, an HP spokeswoman. "The merger will
enable us to invest in multibillion-dollar growth opportunities such
as digital imaging and digital publishing."</TE>
<TE>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina has said the company has enough
shareholder backing to complete the purchase, which she says will
improve sales of server computers and services.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor, said last
week it advised clients, which control 20% of HP, to vote for the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Palo Alto-based HP rose 59 cents to $20.59 on Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Compaq rose 65 cents to $11.80, also on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Intersil OKs Deal to Acquire Elantec</HD>
<DH>Technology: The Irvine chip maker hopes to expand its
presence in Asian markets with the $1.4-billion purchase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intersil Corp., an Irvine-based maker of chips for communications
equipment, agreed Sunday to acquire Elantec Semiconductor Inc. for
$1.4 billion in stock and cash to expand its market in Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Intersil will pay 1.24 of its shares and $8 in cash for each share
of Elantec, the companies said.  Based on Intersil's closing price of
$36.65 Friday, the transaction values Elantec at $53.45 a share,
which is 30% more than its closing price of $41.20 Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Intersil is acquiring Elantec, which makes analog integrated
circuits for optical storage devices and flat-panel displays, to
increase its presence in Asian markets, such as Japan and Korea,
company spokesman Brent Dietz said.</LD>
<TE>   "There's very little overlap in our portfolios," Dietz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We already share a significant number of customers, and we're
particularly interested in combining our product offering in the
Asian market."</TE>
<TE>   The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second
quarter. Credit Suisse First Boston advised Intersil and Robertson
Stephens advised Elantec.</TE>
<TE>   Intersil Class A shares rose $2.86 to $36.65 Friday on Nasdaq.
They have more than doubled in the last year. Milpitas, Calif.-based
Elantec's shares rose $1.59 to $41.20, also on Nasdaq. They have
gained 92% in the last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   The companies were to announce more details of the transaction
today.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent quarter, Intersil reported net income was $13.3
million, or 12 cents a share, for the period ended Dec. 28, compared
with $19.7 million, or 18cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for the quarter were $121.6million, compared with $164.8
million.</TE>

<HD>Sony Ready to Sell Modem for PS2 Console</HD>
<DH>Games: The $39.99 adapter will debut in August and will
have ports for dial-up and broadband connections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BERKOWITZ</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp. took its next strategic step in the U.S. video game
market, saying it will launch online services for its market-leading
PlayStation 2 game console in August.</LD>
<LD>   Sony said it will sell a network adapter for $39.99 beginning that
month, allowing for both low- and high-speed Internet connections.
But in a conference call to discuss the announcement, the company
could not say how many adapters would be available at launch.</LD>
<LD>   To support that launch and encourage development for the new
capabilities, Sony also said it will offer financial support to
third-party publishers for the marketing and development of
online-enabled titles.</LD>
<TE>   The company declined to say how large the fund would be.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had expected Sony to launch the online service, a
longtime goal since the $299 PS2 was unveiled in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sony said it will begin testing the system with a group of about
1,000 players this month.</TE>
<TE>   The PS2 has an installed base in the United States of more than
8million units, and it dominated sales charts during the last holiday
season, in the face of competition from other advanced console
products.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have said the game industry is at the early end of an
unprecedented five-year growth cycle.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one analyst is skeptical about the new online
offering's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "Peripherals and add-ons do not do well in this industry," said
Mike Wallace, an analyst at UBS Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's going to spend a lot of money [on this], first of all
because it's not apparent how any of the third parties are going to
make any money on this, and second of all, there's no installed
base," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace was referring to major third-party game publishers, such
as Electronic Arts Inc. and Activision Inc.</TE>
<TE>   As opposed to other online gaming offerings, the Sony system will
not be pay-for-play; users will pay only the initial cost of the
game, plus standard Internet access charges.</TE>
<TE>   One analyst thinks the relatively low price of the adapter will be
enough to make it successful.</TE>
<TE>   "I would expect a high attach rate....At that type of price point,
it's obviously priced to move," said Jeetil Patel, an analyst at
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Sony spokeswoman Molly Smith said that the slate of launch titles
for the network adapter has not yet been fully developed, but that at
least one title would be the company's "SOCOM," a game centered on
Navy Seals.</TE>
<TE>   Kaz Hirai, Sony Computer Entertainment of America's president and
chief operating officer, told Reuters Television the company would
announce more lineup details at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in
May.</TE>
<TE>   "We look to have a dozen titles or so at least for launch," Hirai
said.</TE>
<TE>   The adapter will have ports for both a dial-up modem and a
broadband connection. It will attach to the back of the console over
its main expansion bay via two included screws.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. launched its Xbox console in November with a
built-in Ethernet port, and the software giant has said it will roll
out online services this year.</TE>
<TE>   The adapter bundle will come with a start-up disk pre-configured
for a number of major Internet service providers, including EarthLink
Inc. and SBC Communications Inc., though Sony said any ISP can be
used with the service.</TE>
<TE>   The only console online gaming service currently offered in the
United States is one for Sega Corp.'s now-discontinued Dreamcast.</TE>
<TE>   The Dreamcast had a dial-up modem built in, but a broadband
adapter was unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   With Sony's announcement, the only major console in the U.S.
market without any online options is Nintendo Co.'s GameCube. The
$199 GameCube, released in November, has no built-in access ports,
and Nintendo has said little about its online plans.</TE>
<TE>   Although last week's announcement revolved around online gaming,
Sony hinted at the network adapter's potential in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Use of the [adapter] allows consumers simultaneous access and
connection to multiple devices in the home through [PS2]," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said that although nothing is definite, the adapter
eventually will allow people to stream MP3 music files from their
computers through the PS2 while simultaneously connected to an online
game.</TE>
<TE>   She described the roll-out of such services as a two-step process.</TE>
<TE>   "Phase 2 is kind of going to be a realization of what our overall
vision is," she said. "It's more of an e-distribution kind of
system."</TE>
<TE>   Although the second phase is not expected this year, Smith said
more details about its launch plans and components would be announced
over the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Sony made a $199 Linux add-on kit for PS2 available
for pre-order. The kit will let people use the PS2 as a computer
running the Linux open-source operating system.</TE>
<TE>   The kit ships with a keyboard and hard drive, although the hard
drive will not work with PS2 games.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said a 40-gigabyte gaming hard drive probably would be part
of Phase 2.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call, the company also briefly addressed pricing.
"What I can say right now is we're very confident of the pricing we
have on the [PS2] console and have no plans to reduce the pricing at
this time." Hirai said.</TE>

<HD>Click and Shoot Camcorder</HD>
<DH>Web-enabled device is an engineering marvel, but it has its
flaws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meet the e-camcorder. Sony's new Network Handycam puts something
different in your viewfinder: the Internet. When you aren't shooting
video, you can browse the Web and swap e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   I tested the $1,700 Network Handycam DCR-IP7BT. This palm-size,
12-ounce marvel of miniaturization may contain more exotic technology
per square inch than any piece of gear I've ever used. It's almost a
concept cam, a flight of engineering fancy whose motors are so small
they sound like mosquitoes.</LD>
<LD>   But the Network Handycam is handicapped by several flaws. The
camcorder uses a new tape format called MicroMV. Developed by Sony,
the MicroMV format stores as much as 60 minutes of video on a
cassette the size of a matchbox--smaller, in fact, than the tiny
audio cassettes used by dictation recorders.</LD>
<TE>   To shoehorn an hour into a matchbox, the MicroMV format compresses
video using the MPEG-2 format--the same compression scheme used for
DVDs and satellite TV. The video quality is excellent, but the nature
of MPEG-2 compression causes the Network Handycam's biggest flaw:
Each time the scene changes during playback, the sound cuts out and
the picture freezes for a second.</TE>
<TE>   This makes for a jarring playback experience, especially if you
paused frequently when shooting. Camcorders that use the larger
mini-DV tapes don't have this shortcoming--transitions between scenes
are clean and instantaneous.</TE>
<TE>   Another drawback to the MicroMV format surfaces if you plan to
transfer your video to a computer for editing. The Handycam IP has a
FireWire jack (called i.Link by Sony), but the camcorder is
incompatible with the Mac platform, on which no video-editing program
supports MPEG-2.</TE>
<TE>   The camera does work with FireWire-equipped Windows PCs, but only
if you use Sony's video-editing program, called MovieShaker.</TE>
<TE>   The Network Handycam's small size makes for small buttons that big
hands might find cumbersome.</TE>
<TE>   I found the camera's zoom control particularly awkward, and
apparently I'm not alone: Tucked alongside the Handycam's manual was
a separate sheet clarifying how to use the zoom.</TE>
<TE>   The camcorder I tested also contained a slot for a Sony Memory
Stick. The Memory Stick can hold short movies or snapshots created in
the camcorder's digital-camera mode. You can transfer stored photos
to a PC or a Mac using the camera's built-in Universal Serial Bus
port.</TE>
<TE>   Or you might just want to e-mail them using the Network Handycam's
Internet features, which are slick and weird at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   The slick part: You can e-mail movies and still photos directly
from the camera--no need to transfer them to a computer first. And
seeing a Web page on the camcorder's fold-out screen is kind of cool.
(You also can connect the camcorder to a TV set to surf on a large
screen).</TE>
<TE>   To connect to the Internet, the camcorder talks to an external
56-kilobit-per-second modem via Bluetooth, a wireless networking
technology designed for short-range (about 30 feet) links between
peripherals. Unfortunately, Sony doesn't offer a Bluetooth interface
for high-speed Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   The weird part: To type Web addresses and e-mails, you must pick
out letters one at a time from an on-screen menu. It's slow going.
Even after practice, it took a full minute to type in www
.latimes.com. Choosing Web links is similarly exhausting.</TE>
<TE>   A Bluetooth-enabled wireless keyboard would make the camcorder's
Internet features more practical, but no such beast is available.</TE>
<TE>   Its shirt-pocket portability is appealing, but I can't recommend
the Network Handycam because of the MicroMV format's stuttering video
playback and limited PC compatibility.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a mini-DV-format camcorder instead. Sony has some fine
offerings here, and one of them, the $2,000 DCR-PC120BT, also has
those wacky Internet features.</TE>

<HD>A New Nintendo?</HD>
<DH>A more mature lineup of games is part of effort to recast
the GameCube maker's image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nintendo Co. has always danced to its own tune, spinning out
home-grown characters and spurning the ultra-violent games that have
proliferated in the industry. That insistence on making family-based
games has fostered the perception that Nintendo is a kid-oriented
company.</LD>
<LD>   This year, Nintendo is out to change that with a more mature
lineup of games and an aggressive advertising campaign aimed at older
gamers, the demographic that rivals Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
are aiming to carve up.</LD>
<LD>   Sony touts its library of more than 300 games for its PlayStation
2 and its appeal with Hollywood celebrities, and Microsoft emphasizes
the technology in its Xbox console. Nintendo is relying on its
reputation for old-fashioned fun, as developed by its lead game
designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, who created "Mario," "Zelda" and "Donkey
Kong."</LD>
<TE>   Miyamoto recently discussed with Satoru Iwata, Nintendo's
director, general manager and heir-apparent, how the Kyoto,
Japan-based company plans to differentiate itself from the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Can you comment on the state of technology in the video
game industry--where it's going and what kinds of games it will allow
you to make?</TE>
<TE>   Miyamoto: I think for a long time we've looked at technology and
at how we can make use of it in games. In the last five to six years,
there's been a lot of focus on what can be done with cutting-edge
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Now we're getting to the point where the technology can only do so
much. People are focusing too much on what you can do with
technology, and not enough on creativity. I'm not certain that a high
level of technology will necessarily make games fun and interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Iwata: In the early stages of the video game industry, the
technology was quite limiting. In game design, you had to find ways
to stretch that technology. Now we've found ourselves with new
technology, and that puts us in a much freer environment. That's
great, but technology is just a tool. It's not our objective.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about online gaming?</TE>
<TE>   Miyamoto: I definitely think there are new elements of game play
that can be introduced with online games. But I think online is just
one method of connecting multiple players.</TE>
<TE>   There are many different ways of playing games. Some games you
want to play by yourself and others you want to play with other
players. I don't think all games are going to go in that direction in
the future. I think it's strange that so many game designers are
focusing so much on online.</TE>
<TE>   Iwata: People are always talking about the positive aspects of
going online, but few people are talking about the hurdles that
people still have to get past, such as the costs of putting a game
online, how much people are willing to pay [and] how many people have
credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Look at "The Legend of Zelda," a game that sold 6 million copies.
If you take a game like that and make it only online, how many units
can a game like that sell? Even with "Zelda," it would be difficult
to sell a million copies as an online game.</TE>
<TE>   People are also talking a lot about broadband. But when you look
at penetration of broadband worldwide, at best it will be 20% of
people in five years.</TE>
<TE>   The other simple fact is that people who are going online are
doing so with PCs and not gaming consoles. So then the question is,
how do you pull that line that's hooked up from the PC to the living
room and get that console online?</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've talked a lot about how there's so little risk-taking in
the industry, that so many of the games out there are just
serialized. What risks have you yourself taken?</TE>
<TE>   Miyamoto: With the launch of GameCube we could have gone with
titles like "Zelda" and "Mario," but instead we challenged ourselves,
and we launched with "Pikmin" and "Luigi's Mansion."</TE>
<TE>   Had we tried to launch the GameCube with our standard franchises,
people would not have been convinced that Nintendo is doing things
differently. But doing it this way and taking risks with new titles,
I think it's turned out very well.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've talked before about how your competitors have tried to
pin you down as a kiddie-oriented company with little to offer older,
more mature gamers. How are you going to change that image?</TE>
<TE>   Iwata: While Nintendo sells hardware, we are the biggest software
publisher. We have the strongest software teams in-house. Those
in-house teams have a better understanding of what entertainment is
and what it needs to be to attract buyers, given the fact that it's
not a necessity in daily life.</TE>
<TE>   People have often attacked us for making games that they consider
childish. But with games like "Mario," an adult can pick that game up
and have a wonderful time.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, Nintendo's opinion is that we make games everyone
can enjoy and people can judge us based on our games. Now, we've
decided to make a more obvious effort to broaden our appeal with
games like "Star Fox." People will see that we have software that
appeals to all ages.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will you rely on your lineup to spread the message that
Nintendo's not just for kids, or will you also have a broader
marketing campaign to trumpet that message?</TE>
<TE>   Iwata: It's not a question of one or the other. You can't just
change an image with commercials. Nor can you silently put out games
and expect people to just know. So it will be a combination of the
two. But the one way in which Nintendo is different from the others
is that we're not a company that tries to change image based on hype.</TE>

<HD>SAG Board to Vote  on Agency Agreement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER  and JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the buildup to a big movie, a tentative deal allowing talent
agencies to sell part of their business to advertising agencies or to
link up with production companies is getting billed as a marquee
Hollywood event.</LD>
<LD>   But, as with a lot of things in the entertainment industry, it may
not match the hype. Although agents acknowledge that the proposed
rule changes hammered out last month with the Screen Actors Guild are
a symbolic first step, they add that the deal hardly will cause
seismic shifts in the business overnight.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is a 63-year-old "master franchise agreement" that
restricts  agents' business activities to protect actors from being
exploited. Talent agencies say that the rules are outdated at a time
when the media are dominated by corporate giants while agencies are
hamstrung by limits  on diversifying and attracting outside capital.</LD>
<TE>   Last month the agents  persuaded SAG negotiators, after years of
trying, to relax financial rules banning outside investors with ties
to the production of commercials, TV shows or movies.</TE>
<TE>   Today, SAG's board is expected to vote on the issue. If the
changes are adopted, SAG's rank and file will vote over the next few
weeks. Friday's election confirming Melissa Gilbert as SAG's
president bodes well for ratification, since she is a strong
proponent of the deal. But there remains vocal opposition throughout
the 98,000-member union, of which only 30% have agents.</TE>
<TE>   The new agreement would allow advertising agencies, major
advertisers and even independent production companies to buy as much
as 20% of a talent agency. Agencies also could invest in production
companies. Studios and their parent companies  would be barred from
buying into an agency.</TE>
<TE>   For years, advertising agencies have been circling the talent
business, looking for ways to spot the next pop culture trend, hot
movie or TV series for marketing and also gain direct access to top
celebrities to promote their products.</TE>
<TE>   So for months, Hollywood has been abuzz that big advertising
conglomerates such as Omnicom Group Inc., Interpublic Group of Cos.
and WPP Group are ready to pounce once an agreement is approved,
turning the talent industry on its head. But agents and advertising
firms said they still have reservations about formal
cross-investments. Agencies said they value their independence, and
the advertising companies are concerned about the meshing of
different corporate cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe there's going to be a sea change overnight," said
Jim Berkus, chairman of United Talent Agency. "Over time, there will
be some transactions that will allow business to be done in a
different way."</TE>
<TE>   Ari Emanuel, a founding partner of talent agency Endeavor, said,
"Every investment banker and all of these advertising agencies have
come sniffing around, but right now there's nothing even close to
being settled.... Nobody's rushing to do anything."</TE>
<TE>   The most rampant rumor for months was that Hollywood's leading
talent agency, Creative Artists Agency Inc., already had agreed to
sell a piece of the company to Omnicom. But CAA Managing Director
Bryan Lourd said, "We don't have a deal with anyone."</TE>
<TE>   There also is the looming presence of billionaire Haim Saban, who
is considering trying to assemble a collection of talent agencies
under one roof. Saban, who recently sold his interest in the Fox
Family network to Walt Disney Co., has talked to all the big talent
agencies, but he is far from forging a deal, according to various
sources.</TE>
<TE>   The most aggressive agency seeking outside investors appears to be
International Creative Management Inc., which hired Rothschild Group
to raise outside capital. ICM Chairman Jeff Berg declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Other agents say they still wonder what they have to gain by
selling stakes in their businesses. Today, a top-tier agency might
fetch only $25 million for a 10% stake, which would then have to be
split among scores of partners and employees.</TE>
<TE>   Agencies probably would balk, however, unless they received a
major premium over the presumed market value. And any deal probably
would pay agents predominantly in stock, not cash.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, heads of some top talent agencies still aren't
convinced they would benefit from having advertising firms as
part-owners.</TE>
<TE>   Major agencies, including CAA, William Morris Agency Inc., ICM,
Endeavor and United Talent Agency Inc., already have forged alliances
with major advertisers--among them Nokia Corp., Coca-Cola Co.,
General Motors Corp., Boeing Co. and Microsoft Corp.--collecting
consulting fees without having to surrender partial ownership. Still,
there are some circumstances in cross-ownership deals that can give
agents and advertising firms the incentive to work closely together.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be invested in each other's success," Berkus said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Dowley, chief executive of Interpublic's sports and
entertainment group, agreed: "Nothing works as well as having [money]
in the game."</TE>
<TE>   In a business where a Michelle Pfeiffer or an Arnold
Schwarzenegger can fire an agent on a moment's notice, talent
agencies are eager to convert their intangible assets, representing
stars, into something with a monetary value.</TE>
<TE>   Agents also may want to use the extra capital to acquire modeling
and sports agencies, public relations and business management firms,
foreign distribution firms and post-production facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the relaxed financial interest rules, agents for the first
time would be allowed to own as much as 20% of production companies
that make movies and TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   But first, actors must sign off on the agreement. Some
high-profile actors are lobbying hard to kill the deal because they
believe it benefits only agents. They said it will blur the lines
between agents who represent them and producers who employ them,
creating conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "This will compromise actors completely," said Oscar-winning actor
and SAG board member Richard Dreyfuss. "If you're an actor going out
on a Pepsi commercial and your agency is owned by Coca-Cola, you have
a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Dreyfuss faults his own agency, ICM, and the Assn. of Talent
Agencies trade group, for failing to explain the issues fully.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe actors are being muscled into something they don't
understand.... This is a way of asking us to give up our protections
and in some way to underwrite their wealth."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also fear that they may be pushed into projects owned by
their agencies, harkening back to the days when giant talent agency
MCA and its chief, Lew Wasserman, had the clout to put their big
stars in their own TV shows, while rivals were forbidden from such a
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal pressure, MCA dissolved its agency business in 1962
and retained its studio operations.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of the deal, including some actors who helped
negotiate it, said there are ample safeguards, such as requiring
agents to fully disclose any business deals affected by the new rules
so actors can leave their agents if they are uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement also would provide SAG with extra money for the
union's ailing pension and health funds and a commitment by agents to
assist actors in stemming runaway production and creation of a
$1-million fund to pay actors when their agents fail or
misappropriate money.</TE>

<HD>Enron, Creditors Negotiating Bonuses for Crucial Employees</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: The plan is expected to be submitted this week.
A previous round of payments is still under intense scrutiny.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As 4,500 fired Enron Corp. workers await meager severance payments,
the bankrupt energy firm and its creditors are negotiating a new
round of "retention bonuses" for the luckier few considered
indispensable to keeping Enron running.</LD>
<LD>   The new bonus package was expected to be submitted for approval by
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York this
week, perhaps as early as today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said.</LD>
<LD>   Few issues in the Enron scandal have raised more hackles than the
$55 million in bonuses that the company awarded to about 550 people
on Nov. 30, two days before filing for the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history.</LD>
<TE>   Critics have made much of the contrast between bonuses of as much
as $5 million for certain key employees and the relative pittance for
the fired workers, many of whom face financial hardship. Gonzalez
last week approved an additional $1,100 apiece for the idled workers,
on top of initial severance payments of $4,500 each.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the fired workers are seeking severance of as much as
$30,000 apiece. The issue has been scheduled for a hearing April2.</TE>
<TE>   Those lawyers and other legal experts also are wondering why Enron
and its official creditors committee have not challenged the
legitimacy of the first round of retention bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Such generous payouts, delivered on the brink of a bankruptcy
filing, raise at least the suspicion of fraudulent conveyance, or the
illegal transfer of assets by an insolvent company, said Elizabeth
Warren, bankruptcy law professor at Harvard Business School.</TE>
<TE>   "Why isn't Enron doing something to set aside those pre-bankruptcy
transfers?" Warren asked. "Is it because the same management is still
in charge?"</TE>
<TE>   At the helm of Enron today is turnaround expert Stephen F. Cooper.
Cooper had no prior connection with Enron, but just below him are
executives who have spent years there and who received large bonuses
Nov. 30. Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey McMahon, for example, got
$1.5 million, and Chief Financial Officer Ray Bowen received
$750,000.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to hand out bonuses was made after the departure of
former President Jeffrey K. Skilling and former CFO Andrew S. Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, who is negotiating the new round of bonuses with Enron's
creditors committee, came under attack Friday when the Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a blistering objection to his being
confirmed as interim chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said Cooper's proposed $1.3-million employment contract is
unduly plush and his past connections with members of the creditors
committee pose conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's lawyers replied that the SEC erroneously relied on an
early version of the contract and that a final version filed with the
court late Friday addresses many of the agency's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the SEC's action places the new retention package
under added scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has not addressed the issue of the Nov. 30 bonuses in court
filings.</TE>
<TE>   The rationale for retention bonuses is that they keep critical
workers on the job to squeeze the maximum value out of a foundering
company's remaining assets.</TE>
<TE>   A big problem with the first round of bonuses--apart from their
excessive size--is that they were paid up front without any
performance stipulations, said Scott L. Baena, a Miami lawyer
representing 700 ex-Enron workers calling themselves the Severed
Enron Employees Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Such bonuses, if they make sense at all, ought to be paid out only
as the recipients achieve designated performance benchmarks, Baena
said.</TE>
<TE>   The failure of Enron or the creditors committee to seek recovery
of the earlier bonuses has been "a great source of frustration to
us," Baena said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is "eagerly awaiting" the Bankruptcy Court's pending
appointment of a committee to specifically represent the interests of
current and former Enron employees. If nobody else seeks recovery of
the pre-bankruptcy bonus money, that group might take on the job,
Baena said.</TE>
<TE>   Although there could be problems collecting from hundreds of
individuals, "we will get that money back," he said.</TE>

<HD>Developer Has Designs on Fashion District Buildings</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Mark Weinstein's Santee Court project would
turn an aging property into modern spaces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear Mark J. Weinstein tell it, his plan to turn 10 Fashion
District buildings into residential lofts, design showrooms and a
cobblestone promenade of fountains and coffee shops will prove the
tipping point in downtown Los Angeles' efforts to reinvent itself.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a destination and
serve a multitude of different needs--affordable housing for the work
force and penthouses for the more affluent--and they can all share
the same amenities," Weinstein said. "It's a city within a city."</LD>
<LD>   The enthusiasm is typical for the 43-year-old developer, who often
sleeps just a few hours a night and is prone to leave rambling
pre-dawn telephone messages espousing his vision--sometimes in
rhyming verse--for anyone who will listen.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Weinstein's proposed 790,000-square-foot Santee Court
development, named for the street that ends at the project site on
8th Street, is not out of the woods yet. The developer has not
secured construction financing for the $120-million project, although
he said he is in talks with six potential lenders--including Wells
Fargo Bank, East West Bank and San Diego National Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Others who have sought to turn aging downtown properties into
modern living spaces and shops can attest to the challenges of
mixed-use projects in areas where problems include a shortage of
parking spaces and a perceived crime threat.</TE>
<TE>   On the upside, Weinstein's Santa Monica-based MJW Investments Inc.
owns all 10 of the buildings, along with the alley that connects
eight of them. That gives him the ability to control the project's
ambience and influence the neighborhood in a way other
developers--including downtown loft pioneer Tom Gilmore--could not,
Gilmore, other developers and architects said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, Weinstein secured a commitment letter for $93
million in long-term bond financing. Sale of those bonds, backed by
Fannie Mae, would be used to pay off the construction loan once the
project is 90% leased. The city has approved zoning changes and the
layout of the units, which will be built to condominium
specifications for possible sale. And Weinstein has hired architects,
engineers and landscape designers.</TE>
<TE>   The project wouldn't be the first to convert old downtown
buildings to housing and ground-floor retail stores, but it would be
the city's largest--604 lofts, 125,000 square feet of retail space
and 115,000 square feet of fashion design showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark is undoubtedly the 500-pound gorilla," said Donald Alec
Barany, an architect whose Santa-Monica based firm was selected last
month to carry out design work for the bulk of the project. "It will
be a community within itself, which will make it unique."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore took on buildings that had been shuttered for years in a
corridor frequented by transients and devoid of retail. But Weinstein
already is collecting rents from sewing shops that fill about 85% of
his buildings, and he can maintain some of that cash flow while
construction--scheduled to begin in October--is phased in.</TE>
<TE>   And his project, the heart of which is bordered by South Los
Angeles and Maple streets between 7th and 8th streets, is situated in
the middle of an already vibrant district.</TE>
<TE>   Entrepreneurs hawking everything from Italian suits to ladies'
wear and handbags pack the district's ground-floor shops. Some
restaurants and cafes already have moved in. And the New Mart and
recently renamed California Market Center--which houses a new gift
and home-accessories mart--are filled with young fashion designers
and wholesalers who are potential tenants for Weinstein's units, said
Kent Smith, executive director of the Fashion District Business
Improvement District.</TE>
<TE>   The business improvement district's security teams already work to
keep the streets clean and safe. In contrast, Gilmore said he has had
to contend with three improvement districts that straddle his
properties, each with different management.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a much more viable location than up closer to skid
row," said Cushman &amp; Wakefield real estate investment broker Carl
Muhlstein. "The streets are wider and cleaner, and they have those
nice, big industrial buildings with steel square frames."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plan Includes</TE>
<TE>   Courtyard, Cafes</TE>
<TE>   If Weinstein's project moves forward as planned, an estimated
1,500 people will become new residents in the area--moving downtown
one step closer to the Los Angeles that civic leaders and urbanists
dream of, a true 24/7 city.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the buildings are clustered together between 7th and 8th
streets, connected by underground tunnels that will help unify the
complex. The alley that runs between the buildings--now filled with
litter, cars and loading docks--will become a courtyard with open-air
cafes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the existing fashion retailers that front Los Angeles
Street can stay, Weinstein said, although he hopes to attract a dry
cleaner, a drugstore and a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent tour, Weinstein dashed from building to building,
pointing out historical features, detailing plans for a rooftop pool
and small gym and poking through the tunnels with glee.</TE>
<TE>   Also part of the project is a building around the corner on 8th
Street. Two more buildings are located farther down Los Angeles
Street, one for loft housing. Weinstein has pledged to make 20% of
the units available to low-and very-low-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   The 10th and southernmost building, at 910 Los Angeles St.--known
as the Gerry Building--will be dedicated to fashion showrooms.
Construction began there last fall. Its art deco facade has been
repainted and the curved windows replaced. Glass partitions inside
are creating open, brightly lighted spaces for designers.</TE>
<TE>   Parking will be among the project's biggest hurdles, Gilmore and
others said, and Weinstein has plans for just 220 spaces. In
addition, building permits are not yet in hand.</TE>
<TE>   But Weinstein is making progress. He has secured the long-term
financing, which kicks in to pay off construction costs once the
project is complete.</TE>
<TE>   For a project of this size, lining up that lender first will
"assuage the concerns of the construction lender," and make one
easier to come by, said Jack Tweedy, vice president of real estate
loans at Cathay Bank, which has no stake in the project.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the age of the buildings, Weinstein expects to sell
historic tax credits to investors that are anticipated to generate as
much as $10 million in additional capital.</TE>
<TE>   The balance of the financing, Weinstein said, will come from MJW
and possibly a few other private investors.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said he expects to secure building permits in July and
begin construction on the northernmost buildings in October.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Law Student to</TE>
<TE>   Real Estate Developer</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein got his first taste of the real estate business two
decades ago while he was a student at Loyola Law School. He urged a
group of friends to scrape together their resources and they bought a
four-unit building for $148,000, selling it three years later to
Weinstein's secretary for $240,000.</TE>
<TE>   Next came a 10-unit building. And in 1988, while still practicing
law, Weinstein took on an abandoned hotel and former jail in Old Town
Pasadena, turning them into live-work lofts.</TE>
<TE>   But when the real estate market tanked in the early 1990s,
Weinstein retrenched. He became a receiver, managing about 350
foreclosed properties from 1992 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   With 70 employees, and offices in Fresno and Reno, Weinstein's
company owns and manages $150 million of real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Weinstein is new to a project of this scale. The seed was
planted in 1998, when a friend called with a tip. Ten Fashion
District buildings were for sale, the oldest built in 1908. The price
tag was $18 million. Weinstein secured a 97% loan and scraped
together a $600,000 down payment, most of it borrowed.</TE>
<TE>   Then he sat back to watch Gilmore's novel experiment with downtown
housing unfold. The wait paid off. As Gilmore leased out spaces, the
loft fad took root, and property values rose.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason this project pencils [out] is because we made a
good buy three or four years ago," Weinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for Santee Court came from two architects and a real
estate broker who approached Weinstein last year. Contributing his
buildings to the project would make it real, so Weinstein signed on.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica architect David Gray and broker Blake Mirkin backed
out about nine months ago, in part because the project was too
financially daunting, Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Gwinn was hired away from Gray's firm by Weinstein and is
now vice president of the Santee Court development. Though the
project's success is still far from certain, Weinstein's competitors
are cheering his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, he could fail as easily as he could succeed, but he's
really driven," said Gilmore, who has seen a 58% turnover at his own
buildings but said he has had no trouble refilling vacancies. "I
think he's got a good shot."</TE>

<HD>More Than  40 Firms Are Eyeing Global</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 40 companies are reviewing Global Crossing Ltd.'s
operations and weighing whether to bid for the company in Bankruptcy
Court, Chief Executive John Legere said in a weekend interview.</LD>
<LD>   The flurry of investor interest in the Bermuda-based operator of a
worldwide fiber-optic network should help the company convince
anxious creditors that a reorganized Global Crossing would yield a
bigger payback than liquidation.</LD>
<LD>   "There's work to be done, but I think we're communicating in a
productive way," Legere said of his recent meetings with bankruptcy
committees. "Looking at the liquidation value of the company is a
mandatory component of the assessment that a creditor has to make ...
but I think they all believe that the company is worth much more as
an ongoing entity."</LD>
<TE>   As part of its Jan. 28 bankruptcy filing, Global Crossing proposed
a deal in which two Asian firms--Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia--would invest $750 million for a 79% stake in
a reorganized Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Creditors and bankers view the deal as insufficient and
problematic, because it would provide less than 5 cents on the dollar
and could raise national security concerns because of Hutchison's
close ties to the Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two weeks, however, three other companies have been
identified as potential bidders: Gores Technology Group and Platinum
Equity, both of Los Angeles, and Texas Pacific Group, based in San
Francisco. Gores and Platinum are run, respectively, by brothers Alex
and Tom Gores, both of whom specialize in resurrecting troubled
technology firms. Texas Pacific, headed by David Bonderman, has
turned around several airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But about 40 other companies have signed confidentiality
agreements to look over Global Crossing's books, Legere said
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That could lead to a bidding war, which would be good news for
Global Crossing's creditors, who are owed about $12 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A new round of cost cutting announced Friday also could make the
company more attractive. Global Crossing said it would eliminate
1,600 more jobs, on top of 754 that were pared in a voluntary buyout
Friday. In addition, the company said it would shutter 71 offices and
cut capital spending to conserve cash.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its new austerity measures, Global Crossing  moved to
cancel leases on two private airplanes--a luxury that was a sore
point with the thousands of employees facing layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In a Bankruptcy Court filing, Global Crossing said the planes cost
the company $260,640 a month, or $3.1 million a year, in rent. The
company pays an additional $5.5 million a year for operating costs,
including maintenance, fuel and a staff of six pilots and five other
employees.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the moves will reduce the company's operating expenses
by 40%, to $900 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Legere said that a leaner Global Crossing will cater to existing
customers and their expanding needs, instead of pushing for
hard-to-get new corporate customers.</TE>
<TE>   For that plan to work, however, customers will have to stick with
Global Crossing through the staff cuts and the uncertainty of
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a dispute with XO Communications Inc. left more than
100 of Global Crossing's U.S. customers without long-distance access
for days. Legere said the interruption was brief and affected a
minute section of the company's network.</TE>
<TE>   XO and Global Crossing reached a truce, and after a few days, the
companies restored services to their respective customers, according
to Global Crossing.</TE>

<HD>Mortgage Rate Hikes Spur Some to Lock In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home mortgage rates are up slightly and probably will rise by at
least half a percentage point as the economy improves, market
observers say, but most analysts don't expect higher rates to brake
the momentum of Southern California's hot housing market.</LD>
<LD>   Another modest rise in rates may even drive some buyers into the
market, they say.</LD>
<LD>   Mortgage applications to either purchase or refinance homes jumped
14% last week compared with the previous week, the Mortgage Bankers
Assn. said, fueled in large part by perceptions that interest rates
will rise. Analysts estimate that average interest rates on homes,
which have been hovering in the 7% range since last fall, could reach
7.5% late this year--still far below  averages of the last three
decades.</LD>
<TE>   "Our experience shows as long as rates are below 8%, people are
not really fazed by rates going up," said Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   If rates top 8%, there will be a slowdown, agreed Dan Gilbert,
chief executive of Quicken Loans, an online provider of mortgages. If
rates stay in the 7% range, he said, "the market will remain strong."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the housing market has shown some vulnerability.
New-home sales in January dropped 15% from the previous month,
according to federal statistics. At the end of 2001, average U.S.
home prices were rising at a significantly slower pace compared with
earlier in the year.</TE>
<TE>   With recent economic reports pointing strongly to recovery,
long-term bond yields have been rising, pulling mortgage rates up as
well.  Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term
interest rates by June to prevent the economy from overheating and to
keep inflation in check.</TE>
<TE>   The average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages rose to 6.87% last
week from 6.80% a week earlier, still below its level of 6.97% a year
ago, according to secondary mortgage lender Freddie Mac. Rates sank
to 6.45% in November 2001, the lowest level in at least three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Even modest increases in rates mean fewer buyers will qualify for
home purchases. In Southern California and in much of the state,
challenges to buyers have been compounded by double-digit home price
increases each year for the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Yet analysts said the loss of buyers because of higher interest
rates could be offset if the economy rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Despite rising interest rates, John Johnston, chief executive at
Marina Mortgage in Irvine, said he has not seen any drop in home
lending, which at his company averages $65 million a month.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Assn. of
Realtors, said a small bump in rates could create an incentive for
home buyers to sign deals before possibly being priced out of the
market by higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who believed he should buy before rates moved higher
was Santa Monica College professor Howard Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't hit the bottom [for rates], but I thought I had done
pretty well," said Stahl, who recently closed on a home in Brentwood
with a 7% mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Alfred Somekh kept waiting for a housing market
slowdown that never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring rates would not head lower, Somekh, a renter for the last
five years, decided to buy a home.</TE>
<TE>   "The way rates could change and the way the market is improving, I
figured now was the time to jump in," said Somekh, an executive at
real estate developer Legacy Partners who is waiting for his home
purchase in Newport Beach to close.</TE>

<HD>Stamps.com's Capital Gives It Sticking Power</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since going public in 1999, Stamps.com has fired nearly 90% of its
staff, burned through more than $200 million and hired its third
chief executive. But after more than a year of restructuring, the
online postage service hasn't been licked.</LD>
<LD>   Among the Internet's first high-profile start-ups, Stamps.com was
also among the first dot-coms to go public, watch its stock rise and
fall dramatically and lay off hundreds of employees in what became a
familiar cycle of boom and bust.</LD>
<LD>   But after many high-tech high hopes died in the market collapse of
2001, the Santa Monica company remains alive, struggling to build a
profitable business around selling postage over the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   "Things changed and so did we," Chief Executive Ken McBride said.
"But it was a very long, hard road to get back to where we should
have been all along."</TE>
<TE>   Stamps.com--which allows customers to print first-class, priority
and express postage from personal computers--has yet to post a
profit, but its losses have narrowed consistently over the last year.
During the fourth quarter of 2001, the company lost $987,000, or
2cents a share, on revenue of $4.5million. A year earlier, Stamps.com
lost $68.4million, or $1.41 a share, on revenue of $5.3million.</TE>
<TE>   McBride said he expects the introduction this year of new
services--including postage that won't expire--to expand the
company's customer base beyond its core of 280,000 and make
Stamps.com profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, McBride keeps the company alive with the $193 million
remaining from its first two rounds of public offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of hard to put a company out of business with that kind
of cash," said Bruce Coleman, who served as interim CEO before
McBride took over in August.</TE>
<TE>   Even with its sizable reserves, Stamps.com faces several hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   PC postage accounts for just 0.1% of the U.S. postage market, and
three other firms are fighting to take some of Stamps.com's dominant
share.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, U.S. Postal Service restrictions and technology
limitations have discouraged rapid growth.</TE>
<TE>   Postal Service regulations require that postage purchased through
Stamps.com expire 24 hours after being printed. And Stamps.com's
technology ties each stamp to a specific mailing address.</TE>
<TE>   McBride said Stamps.com is seeking Postal Service approval for
postage that does not expire, and the company is improving its
technology to print stamps that can be used for any address or class
of postage.</TE>
<TE>   The new products would be Web-based or sold through kiosks and
automated teller machines, eliminating the current need for software
download.</TE>
<TE>   Given recent concerns with mail security, McBride said Stamps.com
is talking to the Postal Service about licensing its technology to
reduce the amount of anonymous mail.</TE>
<TE>   Postage printed from Stamps.com contains a bar code and meter
number unique to the customer; letters or packages that bear the
company's postage can be traced to the sender.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the changes, it's unclear whether Internet postage will
catch on beyond its core of small and home-based businesses. The
Postal Service estimates that there are 380,000 PC postage customers.</TE>
<TE>   But in the months leading up to the company's July 1999 initial
public offering, it didn't seem to matter. In the midst of the
Internet craze, investors threw money at just about any venture with
a ".com" after its name.</TE>
<TE>   Three months before it launched its service in October 1999,
Stamps.com raised $60 million. It raised an additional $360 million
in its secondary offering two months later.</TE>
<TE>   Those funds, combined with the $30 million that Stamps.com raised
from a group of investors that included Microsoft Corp. co-founder
Paul Allen, gave the company enough money to expand, but like many of
the early Internet start-ups, it grew too big too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's human nature. The more money you raise the more money you
want to spend," McBride said. "That was clearly the philosophy of the
previous management team."</TE>
<TE>   Under CEO John Payne, Stamps.com expanded to three
divisions--small business, enterprise and e-commerce--each with its
own staff.</TE>
<TE>   The company also broadened its Internet presence, forming an
online-ticketing subsidiary, EncryptTix, at the end of 1999 and
acquiring the Internet shipping service iShip.com a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   To attract customers, Stamps.com entered into multimillion-dollar
agreements with America Online Inc. and Yahoo Inc. to advertise the
site.</TE>
<TE>   But with free postage promotions and low service fees, Stamps.com
only generated high customer acquisition costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The expenses were not in line with the revenue," said Michael
Crawford, an analyst with B. Riley and Co.</TE>
<TE>   A year after launching the online postage service, Payne resigned
in October 2000 and Coleman took over as interim CEO. During the next
15 months, Stamps.com started cutting costs "before cost cutting
became popular," said McBride, who served as chief financial officer
during much of this time.</TE>
<TE>   The company began by consolidating its three divisions and
focusing on small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   It liquidated EncryptTix last March and sold iShip.com to United
Parcel Service Inc. two months later. A series of layoffs reduced the
staff from about 550 employees to 64.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising agreements were formed on a pay-per-performance basis
only, reducing customer acquisition costs. The company decreased
free-postage promotions by half and increased minimum service fees
from $1.99 a month to $4.99.</TE>
<TE>   About 25% of its customers left after the price hikes--Stamps.com
had estimated that as many as 50% would leave--but the restructuring
has improved the company's overall performance.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the company turned in its first quarter of positive
cash flow. "People are starting to realize there is a real business
here," Crawford said.</TE>

<HD>Message on Sex Abuse Is Heard Across Diocese</HD>
<DH>Catholicism: Cardinal Mahony's statement denounces
'scandalous evil.' Priests' delivery-- and parishioners'
response--vary widely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER, MASSIE RITSCH and TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many Southland Catholics, Sunday Masses were far from typical.</LD>
<LD>   Priests in the Los Angeles Archdiocese were told to read a
statement during Masses from Cardinal Roger M. Mahony denouncing the
"scandalous evil of child abuse" by priests that has shaken the U.S.
Catholic Church from Boston to Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The short statement sparked a range of reactions, everything from
applause to indignation.</LD>
<TE>   Some asked why Mahony has taken so long to deal with the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't necessarily like that the church has been so silent,"
Heidi Galutera said as she walked out of Our Mother of Good Counsel
Parish near Griffith Park. "It's about time they deal with this."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, were relieved to hear from Mahony. "It makes me
feel better that the church is making a public statement," said Jesus
Oliva, 36, as he left St. Vincent's Parish near downtown Los Angeles.
"They are sending a message that the church won't tolerate this kind
of abuse."</TE>
<TE>   After a sermon on the importance of bringing sin into the open,
Father Christopher Drennen of Our Mother of Good Counsel read
Mahony's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony called child abuse criminal and "seriously sinful." He said
the church won't knowingly hire or employ priests, deacons or
teachers when "such an individual is determined to have previously
engaged in the sexual abuse of a minor."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said church leaders have an "obligation to report the
reasonable suspicion of child abuse" to police or child protective
services.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than one week ago, sources revealed that Mahony had
recently forced the retirement or dismissal of up to a dozen priests
alleged to have been involved in past sexual abuse. The action has
not been acknowledged by Mahony, and church officials have not said
whether they have given authorities the names of priests accused of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   After the Mass at Our Mother of Good Counsel, Drennen said
parishioners seemed more somber and reflective than usual. They
appeared to be taking in the seriousness of the issue, he said. Many
said they didn't want to talk, not even to their priest.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some voiced frustration with how the church has handled the
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too little, too late," Erwin David said. "The church
has been too silent. Why are we only hearing about this now, when it
clearly has been going on for some time?"</TE>
<TE>   Added Andrew Fontaine Jr., a retired mechanic from Silver Lake:
"There's been rumors of this stuff. It seems like it happens all
over. The people who have done this kind of thing, a lot of people
feel [the priests] were protected too much."</TE>
<TE>   But Linda Yeaman of Northridge, a fourth-grade teacher active at
St. Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Canoga Park, praised Mahony
for being very "proactive."</TE>
<TE>   "He's ahead of the game," Yeaman said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Catholic Church has been dogged by rumors of abuse for
years, the issue developed into a scandal after cases across the
nation were made public and received widespread media attention.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach, Fla., resigned
after admitting he had abused a teenage boy 25 years ago. In Boston
and Philadelphia, the church has turned over to law enforcement
information implicating more than 80 priests in abuse.</TE>
<TE>   A well-liked Orange County priest, Father Michael Pecharich, was
asked to step down last week after he admitted molesting a teenage
boy 19 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich's dismissal follows a 2001 sexual abuse lawsuit
involving a teenage parishioner in Orange County. That case ended
with a $5.2-million settlement, approved by the Los Angeles and
Orange County dioceses, requiring the church to remove any other
employee found guilty of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's statement was delivered in varying ways by the clergy.</TE>
<TE>   At the noon service at St. Vincent's Parish, Father Emmanuel Osuji
made no reference to Mahony's comments until after his sermon. He
simply made an announcement that the cardinal had a few words for the
congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Osuji read the statement, then, without additional comment, moved
on to announce the week's events calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. James C. Gehl took a different approach at St. Joseph the
Worker Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   After a gospel reading in which Jesus gave sight to a blind man,
Gehl addressed an issue "where the church has been blind as well."</TE>
<TE>   Gehl urged his parishioners to pray for victims of sexual abuse,
their families and the abusers. But prayer is not punishment, and
"this is a crime and it is wrong, and it cannot be tolerated," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, delivered without notes, Gehl criticized church
leaders for too long tolerating sexual misconduct by priests,
singling out Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law for not firing a priest
repeatedly accused of abusing boys.</TE>
<TE>   "The leaders of our church in positions of great authority have
let us down," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lead Singer of Rock Band Is Arrested After Scuffle</HD>
<DH>Police: Puddle of Mudd's Wesley Scantlin, fiancee were
fighting by a Piru highway, witnesses say.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The lead singer of the rap-metal band Puddle of Mudd was arrested in
Fillmore on Sunday morning for allegedly brawling with his fiancee
while en route to shoot a music video, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Wesley Scantlin, 29, was taken into custody on suspicion of
injuring 31-year-old Michelle Rubin of Los Angeles. Rubin also was
jailed on suspicion of inflicting injury, but both were released
after posting $20,000 bond each.</LD>
<LD>   According to Ventura County sheriff's officials, Scantlin began
fighting with Rubin on the shoulder of California 126 near Center
Street in Piru about 8:30 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Several witnesses called police on their cell phones after
Scantlin allegedly forced Rubin into his Jeep Cherokee. The vehicle,
being driven by a third person, sped off toward Fillmore, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified driver followed the couple and told authorities
that Scantlin and Rubin were struggling in the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers stopped
the vehicle near Mountain View Street in Fillmore and arrested the
pair after interviewing them. The reason for the argument was not
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Puddle of Mudd got its start when Scantlin, a Kansas City, Mo.,
native, gave a demo tape to Fred Durst, a Flawless/Geffen Records'
executive and front man for the band Limp Bizkit.</TE>
<TE>   Durst liked Puddle of Mudd's sound and signed the band as the
first act of his new label, Flawless. The band consists of Scantlin,
bassist Douglas John Ardito, guitarist Paul James Phillips and
drummer Greg David Upchurch.</TE>
<TE>   The rock quartet started in 1993 and named the band when water
along the Missouri River flooded the basement of the house they
practiced in and turned it into a "puddle of mud."</TE>

<HD>Three Boys Arrested in Assault</HD>
<DH>Attack: 14-year-olds face charges in what police call a
hate crime against an Asian American man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three 14-year-old boys have been arrested on suspicion of a hate
crime after beating an Asian American store manager they had taunted
with ethnic slurs and white power slogans, Huntington Beach police
reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The attack occurred Saturday about 2:30 p.m. in a parking lot
behind a 99 Cent store near Springdale Street and Edinger Avenue,
said Lt. William Stuart. The victim requested that his name not be
released.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, the manager was working behind the store when
three teens approached and began insulting him with racial slurs.
''They proclaimed themselves as white power people. He told them to
leave, but they started taunting [the manager] and gave him a
one-armed Nazi-style salute,'' Stuart said.</LD>
<TE>   The victim was surrounded and one of the teenagers struck him on
the head from behind. Then all three youths began hitting him with
metal pipes, police said.</TE>
<TE>   ''As they ran away, they swore they would return and kill him,''
Stuart said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim was shaken up but did not require hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   He was able to give police a description of the youths, which led
to their arrests several blocks away. All three were booked on
suspicion of felony assault with a deadly weapon, criminal threats,
and interfering with an individual's civil rights, police said. They
are being held at Juvenile Hall.</TE>

<HD>Battle Over Grave Markers</HD>
<DH>History: Renovator of headstones is being honored for his
work, but cemetery district wants him to stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 3 1/2 years, Gene-o Platt has perched himself at the Santa Ana
Cemetery and pulled out his brushes, chisels and drills, determined
to restore the markers of 483 Civil War veterans.</LD>
<LD>   He arrives at the cemetery nearly every day in his beat-up
wood-paneled Ford station wagon, such a familiar figure that the
groundskeepers know him by name.</LD>
<LD>   But the trustees of the Orange County Cemetery District have told
Platt not to bother anymore. By a unanimous vote last month, the
trustees passed a policy to keep Platt from completing his work.</LD>
<TE>   They say that he may be damaging the historic markers, and that
because Civil War monuments belong to the federal government, he must
receive its approval. The action comes just as a national group
representing descendants of Union soldiers plans to present Platt an
award recognizing his work. The group decided to honor Platt before
the cemetery board told him to stop his work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm appalled they won't let him finish," said George L. Powell,
commander in chief of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War,
when told of the new policy. "He's preserving history, preserving the
memory of veterans buried there, these American heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Platt's name will be engraved on a plaque with other Founders
Award winners that is on display at the National Civil War Museum in
Harrisburg, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors appoints Cemetery District
trustees, who oversee Anaheim Cemetery, El Toro Memorial Park and
Santa Ana Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   The board's new policy says that any work being done on monuments
must receive approval from the trustees. The directive was aimed at
Platt, said trustee Maureen Rivers.</TE>
<TE>   "He shouldn't have been doing it for 3 1/2 years," said Rivers,
who has been on the board for eight years. "We didn't realize the
extent of what he was doing until some of us went out and took a look
at it. I don't think the stones should have been touched.... They
probably would have lasted forever. Quite frankly, I feel they've
been seriously damaged."</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if Platt's work has been a secret. He's as much a
fixture at the cemetery as the markers. "We're with you," a
groundskeeper yelled to him last week.</TE>
<TE>   Honored by Legislator, Historical Society</TE>
<TE>   He's received awards from Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove)
and from the Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society.</TE>
<TE>   He works nearly every day on the Civil War gravestones, maybe a
couple of hours, sometimes as long as the sun is out. He cleans the
monuments, then coats them with layer after layer of white sealer,
finishing by going over the chiseled lettering with gold.</TE>
<TE>   He's also worked on the 8-foot-high bald eagle monument at the
cemetery entrance that reads, "To the Unknown Dead of the Civil War."
A friend repaired the steps leading to the monument, which was
dedicated in 1915.</TE>
<TE>   Like the markers, Platt is getting up in years. The 64-year-old
recently spent a couple of days at the doctor's office having tumors
removed from his arms, and he has arthritis and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Platt spent seven years in the Air Force as a radar technician and
later owned a grocery store and a restaurant-remodeling business. He
came across the Civil War markers while visiting the grave of his
wife, Jean, who died in 1998. He noticed the monuments themselves
looked like they had been through a war, and he took it upon himself
to fix them. Some believe his restorations harm the historic nature
of the gravestones, giving them a cheap look. Still, his supporters
last year gathered 200 signatures endorsing his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Dispute Over Whether Permission Was Given</TE>
<TE>   Platt says he's gotten permission from cemetery officials. His
version is backed by Bill Stetler, former manager at Santa Ana
Cemetery. Stetler said that when Platt started his project, Sam
Randall, the district general manager, approved it.</TE>
<TE>   Randall said neither he nor the board gave Platt permission.
"Halfway through the process, I came along and said, 'What's going
on?' We really didn't step in and say, 'Gene-o, stop,' until a few
months ago."</TE>
<TE>   Rivers agreed that someone gave Platt the go-ahead. "But whoever
gave him permission, as I recall, it was a long time ago," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, not long ago, Randall told Platt the district would pay the
$1,000 he needed to replace silver stars next to the graves. In a
snub to the cemetery district, Platt turned him down, instead using
money from private donors.</TE>
<TE>   That's typical Platt, cantankerous and as stubborn as the lichen
he digs out of the markers. He accepts money from some people, turns
it down from others and spends what he has, which isn't much.</TE>
<TE>   Randall says Platt has finished most of the Civil War monuments,
except 10 that are supposed to be left in their natural state. That's
wrong, Platt said. He has 45 more to do. And it doesn't matter that
the cemetery has placed red flags on those 10 to signal that Platt
should stay away.</TE>
<TE>   "I've committed myself to do them all," he said. (Platt told The
Times last year he had 35 more to finish but now says he must have
been misunderstood.)</TE>
<TE>   Platt learned of the cemetery board's decision when a worker
handed him a copy of the policy. The cemetery board held its meeting
without inviting Platt. That's fine with him.</TE>
<TE>   "If the board of trustees want to talk to me, have them [come] out
here," he said. "They owe me that much."</TE>

<HD>Residents Fear End of Their Trails</HD>
<DH>Chatsworth: Neighbors say proposed 484-home Deerlake Ranch
will spoil horse riding and upset the ecology.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although he lives on three-quarters of an acre zoned for horses, film
editor David Tweet doesn't own one. But with friends who keep horses
nearby, he can borrow one whenever he has the urge to ride.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a thousand miles of trails," Tweet said of his relatively
wild northwestern corner of Chatsworth. "You can go to Magic Mountain
on a horse from here. You can go to Fullerton."</LD>
<LD>   Tweet's favorite ride is up into Deerlake Highlands, north of the
118 Freeway. "The moment you reach a certain point, you're gone," he
said, trying to describe the pleasure that comes from turning your
back on the city and riding into the high ground. "You feel like
you're out in the wilderness."</LD>
<TE>   In the late 1920s, Deerlake Highlands was subdivided into 2,575
minuscule lots. Dozens of modest weekend homes were built in the
highlands. A few still stand, along with a chimney or two that
survived the great fire that roared through in 1971. But in the
decades since, tenacious grasses have all but erased evidence of that
earlier development. Today, hawks soar overhead, scouring the ground
for prey.</TE>
<TE>   But the Deerlake Highlands that Tweet loves is on the verge of
changing forever. If developer Presidio Partners Chatsworth wins
county approval, it could break ground as early as September on
Deerlake Ranch, a community of 484 upscale houses on 230 acres of the
plateau.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Tweet and other opponents argued against the
development at a meeting of the Regional Planning Commission in Los
Angeles. County commissioners deferred their decision until April 10,
asking the developer to address the concerns of neighbors, the
commissioners and others.</TE>
<TE>   "From a horseman's point of view, the biggest problem is the
horrendous size of the project," said equestrian activist Jerry
England, who would like to see the project scaled back to fewer
houses on larger equestrian lots. He also wants assurances that the
trails that crisscross the highlands will be maintained and other
equestrian concerns addressed.</TE>
<TE>   But equestrians aren't the only ones worried about the effect 484
new homes will have on this relatively undeveloped swath of the San
Fernando Valley. The proposed subdivision is in an unincorporated
area just north of the city of Los Angeles, and city residents fear
that almost 500 additional families will clog local streets and
schools and overburden other metropolitan services already stretched
thin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like Ahmanson Ranch," said Greig Smith, deputy to
City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the Deerlake Highlands
area. "It's a large project on our border. The county got all the
benefits. The city got all the grief."</TE>
<TE>   Just as city residents fear increased traffic and bulging
classrooms, outdoor enthusiasts and environmentalists worry about the
effect on local wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Rapagna Cox, president of the Chatsworth Homeowners Alliance
for Mountain Preservation, lives in one of 100 homes that make up the
tiny community of Twin Lakes, which lies closest to the proposed
development. Cox and her husband, Tony, train tigers and other
animals for the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The back of our property looks over the meadow and the creek,"
said Cox, who wants assurance from the developer that the project
will not damage the rich but delicate ecology sustained by the creek
that flows through Devil's Canyon. The near pristine stream is the
lifeblood of the highlands, said Cox, who walks four to six miles
almost every day in the shadow of the Santa Susanna Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The developer has spelled out plans for minimizing damage to local
flora and fauna in the environmental impact report and elsewhere.
Sixty-five live oaks are to be replaced. Almost 2,000 rare but not
endangered Plummer's mariposa lilies are to be moved to land that
will be ceded by the developer to the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy. A biologist will be hired to determine whether two pairs
of rare ashy rufous-crowned sparrows nest on the property. If they
do, construction will be kept at a distance during nesting season,
the developer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Cox said she sees dozens of other rare or threatened species
in the course of her walks, including tarantulas, cranes and foxes.
There is also a breeding pair of mountain lions in the highlands.
"The female has been seen several times with her cubs, and the male
has actually been in our backyard," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   At meetings with community members, the developer has assured
residents that any water that goes into the creek from new sewers and
storm drains will be nearly pollutant free.</TE>
<TE>   Given how passionately Cox and others feel about the highlands,
the debate over the project has been remarkably civilized. Richard
Garlinghouse, one of the three principal partners in Presidio
Partners Chatsworth, seems to be widely regarded as a decent guy, as
does Hans Giraud, a Calabasas engineer and consultant to the San
Francisco-based developer.</TE>
<TE>   Garlinghouse said his firm has made a real effort to keep the
community informed. He describes most of the community members as
"reasonable people," adding "on the other hand, anything that comes
into your neighborhood or comes into my neighborhood is a threat."</TE>
<TE>   Giraud said most of the residents are realistic and know that the
highlands will be developed sooner or later. Giraud said that those
fighting for sensitive development have not resorted to strident
NIMBYism. Instead, "they saw the opportunity to get some benefits for
their community in the process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents are also alert and cautious. Many have been tracking
resident concerns about La Vina, an Altadena project by the same
developer that was billed as equestrian-friendly but seems not to
have made good on trail access and other promises. Garlinghouse said
his firm has been trying to find out what happened at La Vina, which
was built by another company.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who voted to
approve La Vina 10 years ago, has asked for an audit of the project
to determine whether the developer met all the conditions of
approval. The audit is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Watters of Twin Lakes said he would like to see the project
cut back by at least 100 homes. He is also worried about the quality
of any water that will go into the creek and Devil's Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not build equestrian homes?" Cox asked. "People want land.
They want a place where they can breathe and get away from the city
and everything that happens in our world today."</TE>

<HD>Health Care Disputes at Issue</HD>
<DH>Policy: Arbitration provider breaks with HMOs, saying it
will no longer handle such cases unless both sides agree to the
out-of-court process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patients should have the right to forgo arbitration in health care
disputes and file lawsuits directly in court, the nation's largest
arbitration provider plans to tell California lawmakers Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The American Arbitration Assn. will no longer allow its
arbitrators to handle health care cases unless both sides voluntarily
agree to the out-of-court process, said Senior Vice President Robert
E. Meade.</LD>
<LD>   The group's move, officials and lawmakers say, will put pressure
on California doctors, hospitals and health plans to stop forcing
patients into arbitration. In many states, laws prohibit mandatory
arbitration clauses, which are signed as a condition of joining a
health plan or seeking care from a medical provider.</LD>
<TE>   Such clauses are unfair when the problem involves health care,
Meade said. He plans to explain the group's policy change at a
Tuesday hearing of the Assembly Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is more emotional or personal or devastating than a
health care problem," Meade said. "If you buy a lemon car, it's not
life or death. It's not a medical problem. That's what puts this on a
higher playing field."</TE>
<TE>   Some legislators and consumer advocates praised the move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a significant development," said Assemblyman Darrell
Steinberg (D-Sacramento), chairman of the Assembly Judiciary
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "AAA's announcement is a very positive sign that they recognize
there are issues, especially when it comes to people who are forced
into the system, as opposed to voluntarily agreeing to enter the
system."</TE>
<TE>   For the past year, Steinberg's committee has been placing pressure
on arbitration groups to change their practices to make arbitration
more fair to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a very big political trump card to move the issue
forward after years of being rebuffed by HMO lobbyists," said Jamie
Court, director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
and a frequent HMO critic. "This is proof positive that it's
unethical medically and legally to force patients into a secret
process that's stacked against them."</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of California health maintenance organizations,
as well as many other medical providers, require consumers to submit
their grievances to arbitration rather than filing lawsuits. They say
the out-of-court process is speedier, less contentious and not
subject to the variability of juries.</TE>
<TE>   The association handled more than 200,000 disputes last year, but
only 16 of those involved health care. Still, its stance is often
sought in national policy debates about out-of-court dispute
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the group formed a task force with the American Bar
Assn. and the American Medical  Assn. to examine health care
arbitration. The task force concluded in July 1998 that such cases
should only be sent to arbitration if the patient voluntarily agrees
after a dispute occurs.</TE>
<TE>   But the arbitration group didn't implement the recommendation
until last week, Meade said. "This is going to send waves," he
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Kaiser Permanente, the state's largest HMO, say
criticism of mandatory arbitration is misplaced. If consumers are
allowed to choose which forum to take their disputes, they will
select the venue that is likely to award them the most money, said
Michael Hawkins, Kaiser's legislative representative and senior
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "Reasonable people disagree about the issue of voluntariness,"
Hawkins said. "A mandatory system is the only system that we believe
that we can manage."</TE>
<TE>   From March 1999 to December 2000, Kaiser received 1,716
arbitration requests from its 6 million California members. (Kaiser
handles far more cases than other HMOs because it is closely tied to
its doctors and hospitals and pays their legal claims, while other
HMOs do not.)</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear is whether the new policy will apply to medical
malpractice cases. About 95% of Kaiser's arbitrations fall into that
category, Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court ruled in July 1997 that Kaiser's
system was deceptive to consumers by promising fairness but not
providing it. Kaiser gave up direct oversight of the system to an
outside law office the following year, and officials claim that the
new process is a model for others.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that we have a mandatory system that does not
disadvantage the enrollees that use that process to resolve
disputes," Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration for HMO patients has been under fire in other circles
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Daniel Zingale, director of the California
Department of Managed Health Care, said the current system probably
favors HMOs over patients. He has asked insurers to provide more
information on arbitration verdicts to his office so regulators can
study whether changes need to be made.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gov. Gray Davis has not taken a position on whether all HMO
arbitrations should be voluntary, Zingale said. "We've clearly
identified reasons for concern in the system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate last year passed a bill that would allow patients
to bypass arbitration if they sue their HMOs under the state's
patient protection law. The Assembly has not acted yet on that bill,
sponsored by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier).</TE>
<TE>   Drew Liebert, chief counsel for the Assembly Judiciary Committee,
said the arbitration group's move is a watershed event.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's hopefully going to be the first brick falling from
the wall that takes down the whole scheme of forced arbitration on
consumers and patients and employees," he said. "The wall is going to
fall down now, it's just a matter of time."</TE>

<HD>Identity Theft Rampant, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Security: Ventura County authorities say the fraudulent
use of credit data is fastest growing crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, local prosecutor Howard Wise was preparing to move
from the Boston area to Ventura when a man in New Jersey tried using
his credit card to buy thousands of dollars in computer equipment.</LD>
<LD>   About the same time, Oxnard police spokesman David Keith learned
that someone in Orange County had used his name and credit to buy
three cars worth $135,000.</LD>
<LD>   In Wise's case, the thief was arrested and convicted; the one in
Keith's case remains at large.</LD>
<TE>   Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in Ventura County,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In nearly every city, reports jumped more than 300% from 2000 to
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rampant," said Senior Deputy Dan Place, who investigates
fraud cases for the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy, the risk factor is low, and the opportunity is
everywhere," Place said.</TE>
<TE>   If the problem sounds grim, it is.</TE>
<TE>   Despite efforts by police to catch identity thieves and issue
warnings to exercise caution with personal information, there are
signs that the crime will continue to escalate.</TE>
<TE>   "Criminals are far more capable now of creating fraudulent
documents, and they are authentic-looking items that can be
indistinguishable from real driver's licenses and birth
certificates," Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks said. "Everyone
knows someone who has been touched by this."</TE>
<TE>   Crime statistics, authorities say, do not accurately depict the
amount of identity theft--often because people don't immediately know
they have been victimized, or they choose to deal directly with
creditors--but the numbers provide a snapshot of the crime's
increase.</TE>
<TE>   For example, identity theft reports in Ventura jumped from 116 in
2000 to 236 last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard and Thousand Oaks, reports more than doubled during the
same time, from 58 to 139 and from 18 to 51, respectively. Simi
Valley had six cases reported in 2000 and 33 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft was the leading consumer fraud complaint reported
to the Federal Trade Commission last year, and privacy rights
advocates say the number of victims nationally tops 750,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   California had the second highest rate of identity theft last
year, behind the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, some police agencies average an identity theft
report every 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of people being caught and charged is minuscule
[compared with] the number of cases being committed," said Wise, one
of two deputy district attorneys who prosecute computer crime.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities offer alarming data:</TE>
<TE>   * More than 80% of all identity theft locally goes unreported to
police.</TE>
<TE>   * Less than 10% of the reported cases are solved.</TE>
<TE>   * Most victims have no idea how the crime against them was
committed.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug addicts are turning to identity theft as a quick way to
make cash.</TE>
<TE>   Wise, who last month received a restitution check for $85 in his
case, said, "I think it's going to happen to everybody at some point
in their lives. It's just that prevalent."</TE>
<TE>   Stealing mail and rooting through garbage cans remain the primary
methods of pilfering credit card data, personal checks and Social
Security numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Medical office trash is particularly attractive to thieves because
the industry requires Social Security numbers on most paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities say computers and other electronic equipment have
streamlined the crime.</TE>
<TE>   In Wise's case, the prosecutor suspects that a sales clerk at an
East Coast retailer may have used a device called a skimmer to scan
his credit card while ringing up his purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "Often, this crime starts out small with a retail clerk using your
card to charge a few things, and then it gets bigger and they go get
cards in your name," Place said.</TE>
<TE>   A skimmer, which can be as small as a pager, functions like the
countertop machines used to pay or get cash at gas stations.The
device reads and records credit card data off the magnetic strip, and
the information can then be loaded onto a computer.</TE>
<TE>   The data then can be used to make Internet or telephone purchases
or it can be downloaded to another device that codes the information
onto a blank credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Skimmers and other devices used in identity theft--embossing
equipment, document software, scanners--can be purchased at most
electronics stores, Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Even without a skimmer, authorities say, once a thief has obtained
a bank account number--from a deposit slip or sales receipt tossed in
the garbage--a computer can be used to print fake bank checks.</TE>
<TE>   And dates of birth, Social Security numbers and addresses found on
the Internet can be used to fraudulently obtain credit cards,
personal loans--even a driver's license--in someone else's name.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people out there who will use your information to get
benefits in your name, such as welfare. I've heard of cases where a
house was bought," Place said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, according to authorities, hackers have penetrated
corporate databases to download Social Security numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fear that financial information over the Internet can
be compromised," Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to say how prevalent that crime is, but it is
likely the information you gave out to a department store or
electronics store or any other company is being stored somewhere and
can be stolen in a year or five years from now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the method, authorities agree that the most
disturbing trend is the rising number of methamphetamine addicts
involved in identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   Addicts find that identity theft can be a quick and easy way to
obtain cash for drugs or merchandise that can be sold for drugs,
authorities say. Sometimes the criminal is a parolee who learned how
to use a computer behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is little a person can do about personal
information already on the Internet, authorities suggest that
consumers can better protect themselves by reading monthly bank
statements, periodically reviewing their full credit reports and
taking extreme care with documents containing Social Security or bank
and credit data.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a growing problem and it's a major hassle for victims," said
Keith, of the Oxnard police.</TE>
<TE>   An identity theft victim spends, on average, nearly 200 hours and
$1,000 to clear up a credit mess.</TE>
<TE>   Victims of identity theft should contact police to make a report
and contact the country's three major credit reporting bureaus,
Equifax, Experian and Trans Union.</TE>
<TE>   And, Place added: "If you don't own a paper shredder now, go buy
one immediately. This crime will continue because the risk factor is
disproportionate."</TE>

knows someone who has been touched by this."</TE>
<TE>   Crime statistics, authorities say, do not accurately depict the
amount of identity theft--often because people don't immediately know
they have been victimized, or they choose to deal directly with
creditors--but the numbers provide a snapshot of the crime's
increase.</TE>
<TE>   For example, identity theft reports in Ventura jumped from 116 in
2000 to 236 last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard and Thousand Oaks, reports more than doubled during the
same time, from 58 to 139 and from 18 to 51, respectively. Simi
Valley had six cases reported in 2000 and 33 last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Camarillo, the reports jumped from 13 to 91, and in Moorpark
the increase was from five to eight.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai and Fillmore deputies each handled one report in 2000. Those
numbers at least tripled in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft was the leading consumer fraud complaint reported
to the Federal Trade Commission last year, and privacy rights
advocates say the number of victims nationally tops 750,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   California had the second highest rate of identity theft last
year, behind the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, some police agencies average an identity theft
report every 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of people being caught and charged is minuscule
[compared with] the number of cases being committed," said Wise, one
of two deputy district attorneys who prosecute computer crime.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities offer alarming data:</TE>
<TE>   * More than 80% of all identity theft locally goes unreported to
police.</TE>
<TE>   * Less than 10% of the reported cases are solved.</TE>
<TE>   * Most victims have no idea how the crime against them was
committed.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug addicts are turning to identity theft as a quick way to
make cash.</TE>
<TE>   Wise, who last month received a restitution check for $85 in his
case, said, "I think it's going to happen to everybody at some point
in their lives. It's just that prevalent."</TE>
<TE>   Stealing mail and rooting through garbage cans remain the primary
methods of pilfering credit card data, personal checks and Social
Security numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Medical office trash is particularly attractive to thieves because
the industry requires Social Security numbers on most paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities say computers and other electronic equipment have
streamlined the crime.</TE>
<TE>   In Wise's case, the prosecutor suspects that a sales clerk at an
East Coast retailer may have used a device called a skimmer to scan
his credit card while ringing up his purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "Often, this crime starts out small with a retail clerk using your
card to charge a few things, and then it gets bigger and they go get
cards in your name," Place said.</TE>
<TE>   A skimmer, which can be as small as a pager, functions like the
countertop machines used to pay or get cash at gas stations.The
device reads and records credit card data off the magnetic strip, and
the information can then be loaded onto a computer.</TE>
<TE>   The data then can be used to make Internet or telephone purchases
or it can be downloaded to another device that codes the information
onto a blank credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Skimmers and other devices used in identity theft--embossing
equipment, document software, scanners--can be purchased at most
electronics stores, Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Even without a skimmer, authorities say, once a thief has obtained
a bank account number--from a deposit slip or sales receipt tossed in
the garbage--a computer can be used to print fake bank checks.</TE>
<TE>   And dates of birth, Social Security numbers and addresses found on
the Internet can be used to fraudulently obtain credit cards,
personal loans--even a driver's license--in someone else's name.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people out there who will use your information to get
benefits in your name, such as welfare. I've heard of cases where a
house was bought," Place said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, according to authorities, hackers have penetrated
corporate databases to download Social Security numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fear that financial information over the Internet can
be compromised," Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to say how prevalent that crime is, but it is
likely the information you gave out to a department store or
electronics store or any other company is being stored somewhere and
can be stolen in a year or five years from now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the method, authorities agree that the most
disturbing trend is the rising number of methamphetamine addicts
involved in identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   Addicts find that identity theft can be a quick and easy way to
obtain cash for drugs or merchandise that can be sold for drugs,
authorities say. Sometimes the criminal is a parolee who learned how
to use a computer behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is little a person can do about personal
information already on the Internet, authorities suggest that
consumers can better protect themselves by reading monthly bank
statements, periodically reviewing their full credit reports and
taking extreme care with documents containing Social Security or bank
and credit data.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a growing problem and it's a major hassle for victims," said
Keith, of the Oxnard police.</TE>
<TE>   An identity theft victim spends, on average, nearly 200 hours and
$1,000 to clear up a credit mess.</TE>
<TE>   Victims of identity theft should contact police to make a report
and contact the country's three major credit reporting bureaus,
Equifax, Experian and Trans Union.</TE>
<TE>   And, Place added: "If you don't own a paper shredder now, go buy
one immediately. This crime will continue because the risk factor is
disproportionate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like you're walking into a liquor store with a gun.
You're sitting in your trailer ... and you're printing out checks,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Optometry Board Can't See Eye to Eye</HD>
<DH>Politics: The bickering among members results in mediator
being called in to end the gridlock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has come to this: A professional mediator will chair the feuding
state Board of Optometry's next meeting--if its six members stop
bickering over the date, time and format long enough for the healing
to begin.</LD>
<LD>   For more than a year, infighting has prevented the 89-year-old
panel from convening regularly.</LD>
<LD>   As optometrists and their patients wait in vain for the board to
address a growing list of issues--among them, mandatory release of
contact lens prescriptions and new rules for glaucoma
treatment--frustrated state lawmakers are threatening to disband it
and return its functions to the state Department of Consumer Affairs.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm fed up," said Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), chairwoman of
the legislative committee deciding the board's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very dysfunctional. They're a 10 on a scale where 10 is
the worst."</TE>
<TE>   The board's gridlock began simply enough, with numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Charged with licensing and disciplining more than 7,700 California
specialists who conduct eye exams, the board until mid-2000 had a
full complement of nine members: a super-majority of six professional
optometrists, offset by three members of the public.</TE>
<TE>   The lay members say they often felt marginalized, their efforts to
participate stymied or ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as anyone questioned any of the professional members'
opinions, they got angry," said Jane Vogel, an Irvine-based activist
for the blind and visually impaired who has served on the board since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   "They would say we're not going to discuss that, it's already
decided. Everything was already decided."</TE>
<TE>   The power balance swung, however, when Gov. Gray Davis did not
replace the three professionals whose terms have expired since he
took office.</TE>
<TE>   With optometrists and non-optometrists now evenly matched, three
to three, and 100% meeting attendance legally required to conduct
official business, the public members have used their newfound clout
to air long-held grievances.</TE>
<TE>   Many dealt with administrative slights, real or perceived.</TE>
<TE>   They griped that the board president--a professional member for at
least a decade--always assigned fellow professionals the plums among
the board's eight one-member committees, relegating lay members to
duds like Credentials, an inactive panel whose purpose remains
somewhat mysterious.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep telling me I'm on Credentials, but I think maybe it
doesn't exist," said Sunil "Sunny" Aghi, an Orange County businessman
and Democratic Party activist on the board since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   On a more serious note, the public members also accused their
professional counterparts of placing industry interests above
consumer protection by not supporting the attorney general's
false-marketing lawsuit against eyeglass retailer Pearle Vision.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Vogel, they protested the dearth of training requirements
in a board-endorsed 2000 law that expanded optometrists' scope of
practice, allowing them to treat a form of glaucoma and to delegate
some tasks to unlicensed assistants.</TE>
<TE>   "This board has been a total club to protect professionals," Aghi
said. "Nobody has been looking out for the consumers' interests."</TE>
<TE>   The board's optometrist members vehemently deny this, saying
quality eye care has always been their priority.</TE>
<TE>   "This board has been so fair," said board President Gerald Easton,
a Coronado optometrist appointed in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I know of no situation where we've been protective against the
interests of consumers. The board certainly isn't a rubber stamp for
the California Optometric Assn."</TE>
<TE>   Except for an emergency conference in August, the board--which
used to gather quarterly--has not held a full meeting since December
2000, canceling four scheduled dates. The professionals say the
public members are using absence as a power tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got problems, don't just not show up or talk behind my
back," said Steven Grant, a Costa Mesa optometrist on the board since
1994. "This is like sandbox fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Public members counter that they have stayed home only when they
were denied equal opportunity to propose items for discussion or were
given inadequate time to analyze issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see myself as boycotting at all," said Patricia Gee, a
retired educator on the board since 1994. "Why can't we have input?"</TE>
<TE>   The optometry board's escalating hostilities spilled into public
view late last year, when it came up for its regular four-year check
by Sen. Figueroa's Joint Legislative Sunset Review Committee.</TE>
<TE>   After an angry dispute over whether to approve a staff-written
report recommending the board continue unchanged, the lay members
submitted their own 12-point issue paper, which suggested that the
board be reconfigured to have five professional and four public
members, or maybe even a public-member majority.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa said she was leaning toward eliminating the board
entirely, saying she would not play referee to its factions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't take sides," she said. "I just know [the board] is not
fulfilling its statutory responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   All six board members say they plan to attend the mediator-led
session March 18.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to hear their ideas,"  Sheilah Titus, the board's
vice president and an optometrist in El Dorado Hills, said about the
lay members.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't mean I won't fight the good fight. I love a good
argument and I've had disagreements with professionals on the board
too. But I think they feel belittled by us and I don't understand
why."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the two sides have already exchanged tense memos arguing
about the meeting's date: whether all board members were consulted
equally about the date, whether some members mischaracterized other
members' availability on the date and whether members could have
other members removed from the board for not appearing.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the date was changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our organization looks at more than 25 California boards and this
one is the most messed up," said Julianne D'Angelo Fellmeth,
administrative director of UC San Diego Law School's Center for
Public Interest Law. "This board can't even agree on a date to meet."</TE>

<HD>Pearl's Love for Life Remembered</HD>
<DH>Memorial: The slain reporter discovered joy, adventure and
friends everywhere he went.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When slain journalist Daniel Pearl faced adversity, "a good fairy"
always stepped in, his father said. From reuniting with his family
after getting lost on a Tel Aviv beach to finding a ring the day
before his wedding in Paris, Pearl always managed to escape
situations unharmed.</LD>
<LD>   "He knew for sure that no matter how complex the situation ...
some good fairy would take care of him, and she did for 38 years,"
his father, Judea Pearl, said at a private memorial service Sunday in
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   That luck ended Jan. 23, when Pearl, a Wall Street Journal
reporter, disappeared in Karachi while working on a story about
Islamic radicals in Pakistan. A videotape showing his slaying was
delivered to the U.S. Consulate in Karachi on Feb. 21.</LD>
<TE>   After weeks of private grieving, about 450 friends and family
members gathered together to exchange stories about Pearl's easygoing
manner, love of music, clumsiness and desire to surround himself with
friends and family. Those in attendance came from as far away as
Pakistan, Bombay and England; they included boxing legend Muhammad
Ali, who had pleaded for Pearl's release.</TE>
<TE>   The 21/2-hour service was held at the Skirball Cultural Center,
just miles from where Pearl grew up in Encino. A community memorial
service is also being planned at Pearl's alma mater, Birmingham High
School in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Judea Pearl said his son loved to talk to strangers in jazz bars,
on soccer fields, in barbershops and train stations.</TE>
<TE>   "People who we believed were the epitome of boredom, he found to
be interesting, even intriguing," he said. "Little did we know that
talking to strangers would one day invite this tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Speakers combined moments of somber reflection with lighthearted
memories.</TE>
<TE>   The service also included a song that Pearl's band composed during
a 1995 jam session to help a pregnant friend deliver her overdue
baby. The song was performed by two members of Pearl's old band,
Clamp.</TE>
<TE>   "Come out, come out, the world is not such a bad place," the song
goes. "Come out, come out, there's someone smiling upon you."</TE>
<TE>   While some people have called Pearl a hero and a martyr since his
death, Daniel Gill said he saw his best friend more as a person who
loved life.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I think we want to focus on Danny Pearl ... the great big
kid, the goofball, the king of clutter, the loser of tickets," Gill
said. "This is the Danny we want to remember today. The beautiful
friend, the great drinking buddy, the jamming buddy, and of course
the very loving brother, son and husband."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's wife, Mariane, who is pregnant with the couple's first
child, flew in from Paris to attend the service. "Living with him was
like living in a comic book," she said. "So many things happened to
us all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Mariane Pearl said she met her husband at a party in Paris and
corresponded with him for several months before seeing him again. At
that meeting, he showed up at her home in Paris with luggage and a
shopping bag full of food.</TE>
<TE>   "He went to the kitchen straight and started cooking an omelet,
and really made the biggest mess that I've ever seen, and opened his
suitcase in the middle of the living room," she said. "And I looked
at him and said, 'I like this guy.' That is how our relationship
started."</TE>
<TE>   Friends talked about how Pearl made friends wherever he went,
sometimes inviting more people to his home than he could accommodate.
Stanford University classmate Karen Edwards said Pearl invited her to
his home in western Massachusetts when she felt overwhelmed while
attending Harvard Business School. By the end of the evening, the
line for the bathroom stretched outside.</TE>
<TE>   "His personality, his style, his heart was as open as his home,"
Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street Journal colleague Helene Cooper said she learned long
ago that "when you invite Danny to a dinner party, you buy for about
10 people."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper also drew laughs talking about Pearl's absent-mindedness.
One time, she said, Pearl called her and forgot whose number he had
just dialed. "Hey, it's Danny. Who's this?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Childhood friend Louis Rubenstein recalled how Pearl forgot to
pick him up--twice--to see the "Rocky Horror Picture Show." And
another friend joked how Pearl would search far and wide for his keys
when they were in the door.</TE>
<TE>   A slide show and video montage showed Pearl's coming of
age--learning how to dive, playing with his sisters, singing songs
with his father, and conducting a Passover Seder on a train to China,
with rice cakes instead of matzo.</TE>
<TE>   LA Shir, a Los Angeles Hebrew Choir formerly directed by Judea
Pearl, sang a Hebrew song called "Take Wing, Nestling." Daniel
Pearl's lifelong friend Kim O'Reilly Newman played a piano piece
composed by Bela Bartok.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's father said his son had a "unique biological phenomenon,"
which he jokingly called the "lack of malice syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   "There was no malice in his body. Not one little shred.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to bully him, he didn't cry, he didn't bully back. He'd
just look at you in the eye and wait for you to realize how silly you
would look when it's all over."</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks before Pearl's abduction, his wife asked him what
they would do next after they had moved from Paris to Bombay in
search of an adventure. Were they finally going to settle down, she
asked.</TE>
<TE>   No, he responded. "We're going to change the world."</TE>
<TE>   "That was really our agenda in our own way," she said at the
service.</TE>
<TE>   She concluded by quoting a friend, who said, "They may have blown
out a candle, but the light is still on."</TE>
<TE>   Two funds have been established, one for Pearl's wife and future
son and one in support of causes important to Pearl. More information

<HD>A Model for Mainstreaming</HD>
<DH>Special Ed: Disabled, nondisabled students interact at
Perez School, which could point the way for L.A. district inclusion
plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent morning, two teams with a mixture of disabled and
nondisabled students played on an asphalt yard at Alfonso B. Perez
School in East Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A teacher's aide guided Chris, a mentally retarded 10-year-old, to
third base. A child with Down syndrome kicked the ball. Meanwhile,
two boys without disabilities, Ted, 8, and Joshua, 9, were among
those in the infield.</LD>
<LD>   Joshua said he notices but is not bothered by differences between
him and disabled students. "Sometimes I can tell by their faces," he
said. Chris interrupted and mumbled something unintelligible. "Like
him," Joshua said with a matter-of-fact shrug. "See how he talks?"</LD>
<TE>   Chris then became confused and ran to home base, waving his arms
and shrieking. "No, Chris, it's not your turn!" yelled a teacher's
aide. Ted pointed at Chris and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Such interactions are daily fare at Perez. In a rare arrangement,
the special education campus in the Los Angeles Unified School
District also enrolls nondisabled youngsters beyond kindergarten. As
the district embarks on a plan to integrate 35,000 special education
students into all regular campuses over the next four years, Perez
may provide a glimpse of the risks and rewards ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The experience at Perez suggests that, even on a small scale, such
integration can be challenging.</TE>
<TE>   The campus enrolls 400 severely disabled students through high
school and 100 nondisabled only through third grade. Younger students
with and without disabilities play on the jungle gym, make bracelets,
sing, eat and draw together. In kindergarten and first grade, they
work on basic lessons and are not too concerned with popularity.</TE>
<TE>   But as students get older, they are more aware of differences and
mixing becomes harder. Plus, Perez offers what families see as
benefits of segregation to students with such disabilities as autism,
mental retardation and cerebral palsy. In middle and high school
years, it is a sheltered environment where they can shine--even be
elected prom queen or become a basketball star.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, many Perez teachers and parents say
the school's lessons in tolerance and inclusion can help overcome
obstacles of wider integration.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous amount of fear that we won't be able to
accomplish this [districtwide integration] and I think what Perez has
done is provided us with an example that it can be done when you get
creative and use community resources to make it work," said Mary
Falvey, an education professor at Cal State Los Angeles who co-wrote
the district's integration plan.</TE>
<TE>   Integration at Perez began six years ago with the preschool. As
nondisabled students got older, their parents wanted them to stay in
the intimate setting with its attentive staff, which includes 49
teachers and 95 classroom aides. The nondisabled program expanded
through third grade, and administrators are expecting to add fourth
and fifth grades.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in first grade, however, the staff has not figured out
how to integrate disabled children into regular classes other than
art and music. The children are mixed mainly during lunch, recess and
social activities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a struggle," said Principal Beverly Feinstein. "We
want to develop further. We want to have more participation with our
special ed students and general ed students during the day."</TE>
<TE>   Still, teachers say the difficulties of integration at Perez will
multiply when integration expands districtwide. Most challenging,
they say, is meeting the needs of so many different types of
students, including some who may never be in a mainstream classroom.</TE>
<TE>   One may be Michael, an autistic teenager at Perez who stands more
than 6 feet tall, weighs more than 200 pounds and has the mind of a
3-year-old. He has a habit of stripping off his clothes in public.
Michael (his last name and those of some other children in this
article are being withheld at the request of the school and families)
sometimes throws tantrums and has the potential to unintentionally
injure people around him.</TE>
<TE>   "When they try to put students who we know cannot comprehend the
curriculum [in our classes], that's where we have our hands tied,"
said Adriana Perez, a kindergarten teacher in the regular program at
Perez. "We're willing to teach any child--if the child can learn."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning in her classroom, an uppercase and lowercase
example of the letter P was neatly written on the chalkboard.
Six-year-old Leticia Serrano was one of 20 general students spelling
words such as piano, pan and pail. Children in this class perform one
grade level ahead of most of their peers, the teacher said.</TE>
<TE>   Across campus, special education teacher Scott Matz led a group of
the most severely disabled students ages 4 to 9. A teacher's aide
tube-fed milk formula to one student. Matz helped another hold a
spoon to eat mashed hamburger and potatoes. The class sticks to a
painstaking schedule that stresses toileting, physical exercises and
feeding, with a little time for Matz to read them storybooks and talk
about history.</TE>
<TE>   Students in Perez's regular class are learning how to write
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Students in Matz's special class are learning how to hold a
pencil.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not miracle workers here," Matz said. "As a utopian ideal
[integration] is wonderful but ... we're teaching them life skills,
like how to feed themselves and how to walk."</TE>
<TE>   The school is unusual because, other than a school for the deaf,
it is the district's only special education campus that mixes in
nondisabled students after kindergarten, according to Nancy Franklin,
a special education coordinator for the district.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Ortega has three daughters who attend Perez's regular
program. Two are not disabled. One has a physical disability that
requires her to sometimes use crutches or a wheelchair, but she
functions fine in a regular classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega said he liked the teachers and wanted his children to learn
that "everyone is equal."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 45,000 special education students are already
integrated at least part time at many regular Los Angeles schools.
But about 35,000 others attend separate special education schools or
segregated all-day classes. And that group would be at least partly
integrated at all of the Los Angeles district's 660 regular schools
by 2006, under the new plan resulting from a class action lawsuit on
behalf of the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Sherwood Best, a Cal State L.A. associate professor in special
education, praises Perez as one model for integration. "Rather than
the child with special education needs being educated in a regular
campus, we're bringing children with general education needs on a
special ed campus," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she does not think full inclusion will always work for all
students if schools focus mainly on the education of nondisabled
students.</TE>
<TE>   Although many advocates for the disabled welcome integration, some
also say they fear resulting changes as the district's 16 special
education centers, including Perez, admit more nondisabled students.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Rodriguez, 20, is among the 200 disabled students in
Perez's middle and high school grades. He is mentally retarded and
reads at second-grade level. Sometimes he has emotional fits.
Rodriguez was in regular schools until sixth grade, and he hated it.</TE>
<TE>   "They used to beat me up sometimes," he said. "They would steal my
lunch tickets and breakfast tickets too. They chased me around to get
it."</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Rosalinda, said Perez was her last chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to the school and I was like, 'Oh, my God, I don't want my
son here [with so many severely disabled students].' ... But
everything else had failed, so I said, 'Let's give this a try.'"</TE>
<TE>   At Perez, her son is happy.</TE>
<TE>   He carries a picture of his girlfriend, who also is mentally
retarded, in his wallet. He once sang his favorite Beatles song,
"Yesterday," in the school's talent show.</TE>
<TE>   He works part time doing office work at the school, and he wants
to eventually earn a steady income and get his own apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Rodriguez attended the annual prom, where
students dress up in gowns and tuxedos, some rent limos and a king and
queen are elected--the kind of social experience at Perez that staff
members fear their students will lose when the school is converted
into a primary center or elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   There is a basketball team made up mostly of mentally retarded
boys, and a squad of varsity cheerleaders. The other day, cheerleader
coach Diana Tucker led the girls, most of whom are mentally retarded,
in a routine to a rendition of "Turn the Beat Around." Wearing yellow
T-shirts, the girls spun and shimmied, waving yellow, blue and white
pompoms.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker said her girls would never have the opportunity to cheer on
varsity squads in general schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think regular kids make cheerleading teams?" she asked. "I
mean, if you have a pimple, you don't make the team."</TE>
<TE>   Falvey, however, said students with disabilities have become
school dance kings, leaders and even cheerleaders at regular schools
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "For so many of us who grew up in schools that didn't have kids
with disabilities, our first reaction is usually fear," Falvey said.
"If students grow up around each other, there will be less teasing
and stereotyping."</TE>
<TE>   Perez's physical plant also has its advantages.</TE>
<TE>   Every hallway is spacious, every door is wide enough for a
wheelchair, next to every stairway is a ramp. Some classrooms have
large bathrooms with open doors. There are three full-time nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers at Perez fear that wider integration will be
disastrous if the district does not devote enough resources to extra
training for teachers and renovating buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the rewards at Perez are well worth the effort.</TE>
<TE>   In Blanca Garcia's integrated preschool class recently, two
teachers--one general and one special--and four assistants watched
and directed the children as they made bracelets.</TE>
<TE>   Four-year-old Andrea created a friendship bracelet of blue, red,
pink and black beads. Three-year-old Lucero reached for a bead with
her left hand and held onto her walker with the other. Lucero, who is
developmentally delayed, knocked over the tray, spilling the beads
onto the table. Then she reached for Andrea's bracelet. "No," Andrea
said, pulling the bracelet away.</TE>
<TE>   Lucero stumbled to another table, where students were separating
candy hearts by color. She and a nondisabled student got into a
tugging match over a tray of hearts. "That's not nice," a teacher's
aide told them</TE>
<TE>   But when Garcia later asked the class to whom they would
give their friendship bracelets, Andrea raised her hand and shouted: "I
want to give my bracelet to Lucero!"</TE>

<HD>USA Today Casts a Paul Over Simon's Big Day After</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beltway myopia strikes again: The morning he woke up as the
Republicans' nominee for governor of California, Bill Simon showed up
at a unity breakfast with other GOPsters.</LD>
<LD>   He told his fellow breakfasters that the results had him pinching
himself to believe it. So it must have been deflating to hear from a
friend who had called earlier that morning to tell him that he was on
the front page of USA Today under the headline "Paul Simon Jr. gets
the nomination." Simon passed this along to his wife, Cynthia, whose
response was: "I think you need to do a little more work on your name
ID."</LD>
<LD>   Or just get Art Garfunkel to run for lieutenant governor.</LD>
<TE>   (The error was evidently corrected for the newspaper's Web site,
but for the sheer "duh" factor when it comes to things Californian,
it was reminiscent of a New York Times headline several years ago
about the space shuttle landing at Edwards Air Force Base: "After
Detour to California, Shuttle Returns to Earth.")</TE>
<TE>   If the nominee had been Paul Simon, he would have been serenaded
on election night with "Kodachrome" or "Graceland," rather than the
tunes that greeted the blue-eyed Simon in a hotel ballroom--like
"Brown-Eyed Handsome Man," written by rockmeister Chuck Berry. Come
November, Gray Davis hopes the song Simon will find himself humming
will be "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain."</TE>
<TE>   Don't Touch the Hair of the Head of State</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, over on the Democratic side: On the victory plane from
Los Angeles to San Francisco the morning after the election, Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer, who won his primary without breaking a sweat,
mentioned to Gov. Gray Davis, ditto, that it might be a good idea to
let a San Francisco deejay who's been harping on Davis' hair just go
ahead and muss the governor's silvery helmet and get it over with.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has been known to beg off wearing hard hats--the press
jokes that that's because his hair is already up to code--did not
appear much taken by the idea.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 GOP primary finisher Richard Riordan liked to joke about
Davis' careful coif, telling one voter, "I'm going to outlaw
hairspray; that'll make him move out of California." Riordan's own
locks sometimes look to be casually styled by the Santa Ana winds.</TE>
<TE>   Higher Office, Maybe, but Not a Bigger One</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast: Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer was doing a
victory dance last week after Orange County voters said "yes" to his
plan for a new charter for the county. That's inside-baseball talk,
but it does mean that if someone quits the board before the end of
the term, the empty chair will be filled by a special
election--meaning probably a Republican--instead of by a
gubernatorial appointment--meaning probably a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has every intention of vacating his own supe seat in
December, when he expects to be sworn in as a Republican in the state
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   But Dems all but promise that the party will be over for Spitzer
when he gets to that big marble dome in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis--whose reputation is not so much for getting mad as
getting even--will not forget how Spitzer campaigned for his charter
change by trashing Davis' leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Todd shouldn't be surprised if he sees the janitor has a bigger
office," was the word from Democratic consultant Bob Mulholland. "I'm
not sure he's going to get any breakfast meetings with the governor."
Unless he buys a ticket to a fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Marathon Critics Running for Cover</TE>
<TE>   If you think the sight of thousands of thundering runners is
something, imagine thousands of runners' e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   After a Times story detailed how the city of L.A. is putting a
magnifying glass to the dollars and cents it takes to stage the L.A.
Marathon--nobody seems to be certain what the final figure is--the
marathon organizers sent out thousands of e-mails to runners in the
recent race, advising runners to contact certain city officials and
sounding the alarm that "the future of your Los Angeles Marathon may
be in jeopardy"--never mind the fact that the present marathon
contract is good until 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Marathon mucky-mucks point out that the event brings good money to
L.A., and anyway, the city waives fees at other TV-intense events
like the Academy Awards (although no one sends out Joan Rivers to do
fashion commentary on the marathon; "Who did your T-shirt?" is not a
question the nation is waiting to have answered.)</TE>
<TE>   Two city officials who had the temerity to express their
cost-benefit concerns about the marathon have been spammed like mad,
with more than 1,000 e-mails and phone calls jamming the lines to
City Controller Laura Chick and Councilman Jack Weiss, who helped to
trigger this e-valanche with the simple point, "We are not paying
attention to the overall amounts of money that are going out for
these things." One e-mailer suggested to Weiss that he run the
marathon himself and then see what he thinks of it.</TE>
<TE>   One mass e-mail from the marathon folks gave a wrong phone number
for Weiss, and so some poor city worker's phone was ringing like mad
all day with complaints from the short-pants-and-panting set.</TE>
<TE>   Sweating Out a Win Over a Noncandidate</TE>
<TE>   Between the big-money race for district attorney and a big-mud
supervisorial race, nobody in Ventura County was expending much
attention on the contest for treasurer-tax collector.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the assistant treasurer-tax collector, Larry Matheny,
was sweating right up to the end. First he was the front-runner, and
then he was the only-runner, but that didn't put him at ease.</TE>
<TE>   His challenger, former Thousand Oaks council member Mike Markey,
had dropped out of the election too late for his name to be yanked
from the ballot. Suffering from the sort of political paranoia only a
candidate can understand--inattentive voters have sometimes elected
dead candidates--Matheny fretted over what he would do if he were
beaten by a man who wasn't even running.</TE>
<TE>   Markey did get 16% of the vote, but Matheny won handily. "You
realize if I lost to him, I'd have to leave the area permanently."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Still seeking spellcheck: a Bill Simon press release laid out
his "tenative" schedule for the day after election.</TE>
<TE>   * A day or two before the election, with his prospects fast
fading, Richard Riordan was still getting contributions--$91,000 and
change on Monday, including $25,000 from someone at the Goldman Sachs
brokerage house, and $199,000 on March 3 from Paula J. Brooks of Park
City, Utah, who had already donated $75,000 to the former L.A. mayor.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange County is sending two Republicans to play in the majors:
Fullerton state Sen. Dick Ackerman flew solo in the primary and will
take on Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, and Anaheim's Katherine H. Smith,
buoyed by conservative turnout, will be on the November ballot for
the job of superintendent of public instruction against Democratic
state Sen. Jack O'Connell.</TE>
<TE>   * The Riordan campaign, in dismantling its operation after March5,
shut down its internal e-mail so quickly that folks trying to send
out congratulatory or commiserating e-mails (or maybe job inquiries)
were getting them bounced back.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "We're the only trailer park in Sausalito."</TE>
<TE>   --Police Capt. Jim Hyatt's comments after Sausalito voters turned
down a measure to build a new $7.8-million police and fire building
so public safety workers could move out of waterfront trailers and a
seismically unsafe building. Opponents said the building wouldn't fit
the town's look or scale and violated its feng shui.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A cutout, a cut-up and a kid: A cardboard cutout of President
George W. Bush wearing a Riordan-for-governor sticker, Audrey Rattan
doing a Charlie Chaplin thing, and Sylmar 8-year-old Hector Padilla
getting a kick out of the combination, at the Republican primary
election-night conclave near Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill me later: Just in case California's new Republican nominee
for governor, Bill Simon, needed more motivation to resume
campaigning, an item on the front page of USA Today on the morning
after his big win in the state primary referred to him as Paul Simon
Jr.</TE>

<DH>Education: Groups from left and right back Anaheim board
member Katherine H. Smith.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A little-known school board member from Anaheim surprised the
education establishment last week by placing second in the primary
for California superintendent of public instruction.</LD>
<LD>   Katherine H. Smith beat the well-funded and better-known
Assemblywoman Lynne Leach (R-Walnut Creek) and now faces State Sen.
Jack O'Connell in November in the nonpartisan race to replace Delaine
Eastin, who must step down because of term limits. Smith forced a
runoff because O'Connell did not receive more than 50% of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a novelty," said Scott Plotkin, executive director of the
California School Boards Assn. "She was the one who all the political
experts were just writing off."</LD>
<TE>   Now, they're trying to figure out just who this underdog is, and
they may be in for some surprises.</TE>
<TE>   She's a Goldwater Republican who says she knew and admired Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver. She has pushed for the nationwide adoption
of school uniforms and a moment of silence for students each morning.
She once proposed having children spring to their feet in respect
whenever an adult entered the classroom. But she has also spent the
last 20 years fighting for more liberal drug laws. If elected, she
wants to improve education programs in California's prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a trustee in the Anaheim Union High School District, has
the endorsements of both a conservative Christian group and a
left-leaning Latino-rights organization.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the most conservative candidate on the ballot," said Mark
Bucher, founder of the Education Alliance, which received national
attention in the 1990s for its campaign to put conservatives--often
Christians--on school boards. "She's a candidate that stands for
back-to-basics values."</TE>
<TE>   But Smith, 61, has shown herself a strong advocate for Latino
students, said Amin David of Los Amigos of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a very liberal, progressive group, and she doesn't seem to
fit that mold, does she?" David said. "But on education, I think we
can have a meeting of the minds."</TE>
<TE>   David said he grew to admire Smith when she opposed a proposal by
fellow Anaheim board member Harald G. Martin. Martin wanted to
require students to show proof of legal U.S. residency or risk being
turned over to immigration authorities. The motion died without a
second.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an extremely different kettle of fish" from other education
leaders, said Smith, a former fashion model who left college shortly
before finishing and pulled her two children, now grown, out of
public school in the 1980s to enroll them in Catholic school. "I'm a
reader, a citizen-observer. I take things issue by issue and decide
what is the right way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who has raised only $18,000, compared with the more than $2
million O'Connell has pulled in, said she would think hard before
accepting money from any group. The only groups she said she would be
completely comfortable taking money from would be law enforcement
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Her Funding Is From Friends, Family</TE>
<TE>   Smith likes knowing that most of her contributions have come from
friends, family and administrators in her school district. The
California Republican Party will support Smith with mailers and
ballot statements, spokesman Rob Stutzman said.</TE>
<TE>   Though she spent little on her campaign, she said she was not
surprised by her strong second-place finish. Early polling had shown
she was popular, so she didn't even stay up late Tuesday night to
make sure she was in the runoff. She was tired, she said, and had to
get up before dawn to feed her Shih Tzu Tiffy and fix breakfast for
her husband Clarke, a doctor, before heading out to jury duty.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a politician," she said. "I never will be."</TE>
<TE>   She's mainly interested in the job as a bully pulpit for her
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts point out that the job she seeks offers little power
for her to institute those ideas. The superintendent manages the
Department of Education's $47-billion budget and its 1,600 employees,
and works with the Legislature to pass programs, said Plotkin, of the
school boards association.</TE>
<TE>   These are areas where her opponent, a former high school teacher
and state senator from San Luis Obispo, has much experience.
O'Connell wrote the legislation that led to smaller class sizes in
primary grades and backed the new high school exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   "I think support for Jack O'Connell will grow tremendously once
people in the state really understand who she is and what her
objectives are," said Wayne Johnson, president of the California
Teachers' Assn. O'Connell has received thousands of dollars from
teachers unions and individual school administrators and teachers.
"He obviously wants to support the public schools."</TE>
<TE>   Eastin, the current superintendent, endorses O'Connell too.</TE>
<TE>   Gale Kaufman, an O'Connell campaign consultant, said she doesn't
know much about Smith but suspects the two candidates have little in
common.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Smith's interests are far removed from the test scores
and carrot-and-stick accountability programs that have transformed
public education in California in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   She advocates giving all districts the same amount of money per
student. She thinks there is too much testing.</TE>
<TE>   Her real passion is in symbolic programs--such as moments of
silence and changes of dress--designed to bring about deeper
transformations within individuals. Her mission statement, posted on
her Web site, www.superkathy.com, is "to change behavior by changing
attitudes."</TE>
<TE>   That's what she said she has done with great success in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   She was among the first school leaders in the country to push for
school uniforms on public campuses, lobbying successfully for them in
1992 as a community activist in La Habra schools. She now wants to
encourage schools statewide to adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   She also wants all California children to begin each morning with
a moment of silent reflection. She believes the practice, which she
brought to Anaheim schools in 1999, promotes academic success and
inner calm by giving children a moment to think about their lives and
their priorities. She said the practice is not intended to encourage
school prayer, but students are free to pray if they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas include bringing lockers back to secondary schools so
children aren't forced to lug book bags around and issuing report
cards for parents. The cards would offer a checklist of questions,
such as "Did you make your child breakfast?" and "Did you read to
your child?"</TE>
<TE>   "I would lead by the virtue of my ideas," she said.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard May End Its Ban on Movie Theaters</HD>
<DH>Development: In hopes of attracting a cinema downtown, city
forbids them elsewhere. But with no plan in sight, it may change
course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Oxnard can't get a developer soon to build a movie theater
downtown, the City Council may lift its prohibition on theater
construction elsewhere in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Tom Holden, who drafted the ban in 1998 as part of a
downtown revitalization effort, said he expects the council to
discuss the matter when it meets next week. The council will be
briefed in closed session on ongoing negotiations with Sanborn
Theaters Inc. of Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "The focus has been to have it [the theater] in downtown so it
serves to trigger the redevelopment of the area," Holden said.</LD>
<TE>   "But ultimately, if it doesn't pencil out, we'd have to rethink
whether we should continue with that strategy," he said. "If we start
to look at sites closer to the freeway, it's pretty much a
no-brainer. We'd probably have multiple developers interested."</TE>
<TE>   The city has been looking for another developer to pair with
Sanborn to build a multiscreen theater on a city-owned block along A
Street, after a $14-million proposal with developer Victor Georgino
fell apart last year. Those plans called for a 55,000-square-foot
theater and 85,000 square feet of retail space. It was the third
downtown theater deal to collapse since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Though there has been continual interest in the downtown site,
talks invariably have broken down because developers want the city to
subsidize a greater portion of the project than council members are
willing to consider.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's the most populous city in Ventura County, Oxnard has
no first-run theater. On nights and weekends, its movie fans spend
their money at modern theaters in neighboring Ventura and Camarillo.
Meanwhile, the city loses out on potential property taxes from
theater owners and sales tax from customers.</TE>
<TE>   Holden said his restrictive movie theater ordinance was intended
to spur theater construction downtown, not keep new films out of
Oxnard. The ordinance has had little practical effect in recent years
because overbuilding nationally in the movie theater industry created
a wave of closures and bankruptcies as smaller, older theaters lost
out to newer multiplexes.</TE>
<TE>   The shakeout closed a theater in Moorpark last year and has
stymied efforts to bring a new multiplex to a site adjacent to the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The number of movie screens nationwide continues to shrink. But in
recent weeks, some industry experts in Southern California have been
suggesting that construction is beginning again, specifically in
populous neighborhoods that lack theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard redevelopment officials are expected to bring council
members up to speed on their search for another downtown theater
developer at Tuesday's closed session, said Brian Pendleton, the
city's redevelopment services manager. Pendleton declined to discuss
the search in advance of the meeting. But council members are
preparing for disappointing news.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever comes forward next week will be a determining factor,"
Councilman Bedford Pinkard said. "If we don't have a developer for
the downtown [theater project], I'd be willing to drop the
ordinance."</TE>

<HD>Catholics Hear Message on Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Church: L.A. Cardinal Mahony's statement denounces
'scandalous evil.' Priests' deliveries-- and parishioners'
responses--vary widely.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For many Southland Catholics, Sunday Masses were far from typical.</LD>
<LD>   Priests in the Los Angeles Archdiocese were told to read a
statement during Masses from Cardinal Roger M. Mahony denouncing the
"scandalous evil of child abuse" by priests that has shaken the U.S.
Roman Catholic Church from Boston to Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The short statement sparked a range of reactions, from applause to
indignation.</LD>
<TE>   Some asked why Mahony has taken so long to deal with the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't necessarily like that the church has been so silent,"
Heidi Galutera said as she walked out of Our Mother of Good Counsel
Parish near Griffith Park. "It's about time they deal with this."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, were relieved to hear from Mahony. "It makes me
feel better that the church is making a public statement," said Jesus
Oliva, 36, as he left St. Vincent's Parish near downtown Los Angeles.
"They are sending a message that the church won't tolerate this kind
of abuse."</TE>
<TE>   A week ago in Orange County, Father Michael Pecharich was forced
to resign by Bishop Tod D. Brown as part of the new zero-tolerance
policy for priests with substantiated charges of molestation in their
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines, adopted by both the Los Angeles and Orange
dioceses this year, were a requirement in a $5.2-million settlement
to a single victim who accused Msgr. Michael Harris, a high-ranking
priest in Orange County, of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich admitted to molesting a teenage boy 19 years ago, an
admission that polarized some in his congregation at San Francisco
Solano in Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Many thought the priest had straightened out his life. Others were
outraged that they weren't told that Pecharich had admitted sexually
abusing a minor to diocesan officials in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   A second victim came forward last week to accuse Pecharich of
sexual abuse about 25 years ago. Jim Griley, 38, of Morro Bay said he
went public because of comments from some of Pecharich's parishioners
that their priest had been unfairly ousted from the diocese.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials in Orange County are still combing through
personnel files to see if other priests have past incidents of sexual
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   After a sermon on the importance of bringing sin into the open,
Father Christopher Drennen of Our Mother of Good Counsel read
Mahony's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony called child abuse criminal and "seriously sinful." He said
the church won't knowingly hire or employ priests, deacons or
teachers when "such an individual is determined to have previously
engaged in the sexual abuse of a minor."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said church leaders have an "obligation to report the
reasonable suspicion of child abuse" to police or child protective
services.</TE>
<TE>   A little over a week ago, sources revealed that Mahony had
recently forced the retirement or dismissal of up to a dozen priests
alleged to have been involved in sexual abuse. The action has not
been acknowledged by Mahony, and church officials have not said
whether they have given authorities the names of priests accused of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   After the Mass at Our Mother of Good Counsel, Drennen said
parishioners seemed more somber and reflective than usual. They
appeared to be taking in the seriousness of the issue, he said. Many
said they just didn't want to talk, not even to their priest.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some voiced frustration with how the church has handled the
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too little, too late," Erwin David said. "The church
has been too silent. Why are we only hearing about this now, when it
clearly has been going on for some time?"</TE>
<TE>   Added Andrew Fontaine Jr., a retired mechanic from Silver Lake:
"There's been rumors of this stuff. It seems like it happens all
over. The people who have done this kind of thing, a lot of people
feel [the priests] were protected too much."</TE>
<TE>   But Linda Yeaman of Northridge, a fourth-grade teacher active at
St. Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Canoga Park, praised Mahony
for being "proactive."</TE>
<TE>   "He's ahead of the game," Yeaman said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Catholic Church has been dogged by rumors of abuse for
years, the issue developed into a scandal after cases across the
nation were made public and received widespread media attention.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach, Fla., resigned
after admitting he had abused a teenage boy 25 years ago. In Boston
and Philadelphia, the church has turned over to law enforcement
information implicating more than 80 priests in abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's statement was delivered in varying ways by the clergy.</TE>
<TE>   At the noon service at St. Vincent's Parish, Father Emmanuel Osuji
made no reference to Mahony's comments until after his sermon. He
simply made an announcement that the cardinal had a few words for the
congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Osuji read the statement, then, without additional comment, moved
on to announce the week's events calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. James C. Gehl took a different approach at St. Joseph the
Worker Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   After a Gospel reading in which Jesus gave sight to a blind man,
Gehl addressed an issue "where the church has been blind as well."</TE>
<TE>   Gehl urged his parishioners to pray for victims of sexual abuse,
their families and the abusers.</TE>

<HD>Angola's Jonas Savimbi Was No Freedom Fighter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PIERO GLEIJESES</AU>
<BD>Piero Gleijeses, a professor of U.S. foreign policy at
Johns Hopkins University, is author of "Conflicting Missions: Havana,
Washington and Africa, 1959-1976" (University of North Carolina
Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Friend and foe acknowledged the abilities and charisma of Jonas
Savimbi, the Angolan rebel leader who was killed by government troops
last month.</LD>
<LD>   "Savimbi is very intelligent," Lucio Lara, a senior aide to his
bitter rival, Agostinho Neto, once admitted.</LD>
<LD>   Savimbi also never deviated from his overriding goals or
principles. It is odd, however, that Americans have failed to
appreciate what these goals and principles were.</LD>
<TE>   During Angola's war of independence against the Portuguese in
1961-1974, Savimbi was an impressive guerrilla leader, but his
movement, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, was far weaker than Neto's Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola, or MPLA.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1972, Savimbi proposed to have his forces cooperate
with the Portuguese to "eliminate" the MPLA. The Portuguese responded
favorably, and for the next 18 months Savimbi was their ally. But in
late 1973, Lisbon broke the agreement and attacked UNITA. And so
Savimbi became known, much against his will, as a "freedom fighter,"
even though he was still trying to forge a new alliance with Lisbon
when the Portuguese regime was overthrown in April 1974.</TE>
<TE>   By 1977, the story of Savimbi's betrayal of the Angolan
independence movement was public knowledge in Western Europe. In
1979, the mainstream Lisbon weekly Expresso concluded: "The fact that
Savimbi collaborated with the Portuguese colonial authorities has
been so amply proven that no one can question it in good faith."</TE>
<TE>   No one, that is, but Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi's betrayal of the independence struggle has been
overlooked in the thousands of press reports and scores of books
written about Angola, and, even now, in the articles about his death.</TE>
<TE>   America's love story with Savimbi began in 1975, when he became
our protege in the covert operation Henry Kissinger unleashed in
Angola. And even earlier, he had mesmerized the South Africans.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of the collapse of the Portuguese dictatorship,
Savimbi approached the white rulers in Pretoria for help in the
impending civil war in Angola. If he won, he promised to maintain
friendly relations with the apartheid regime. How tempting,
particularly when the MPLA vowed that there would be no peace in
southern Africa until apartheid had been defeated.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1975, with Washington's blessing, South Africa began its
covert operation in Angola to support Savimbi.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Savimbi was not a South African puppet. He was simply being
true to himself. He was a warlord whose overriding principle was
absolute power, and if this required an agreement with Portuguese
colonial authorities first, and then a dalliance with apartheid, so
be it.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1975, with Washington's urging, South African troops
invaded Angola. Crashing through MPLA resistance, they would have
taken Luanda, the MPLA stronghold, had Fidel Castro not sent Cuban
soldiers to Angola in early November. Contrary to U.S. reports of the
time, Castro did so without consulting Moscow. He was no client. "He
was probably the most genuine revolutionary leader then [1975] in
power," Kissinger writes in his memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   By April 1976, the Cubans had pushed the South Africans back into
Namibia, and Savimbi had resumed guerrilla war. Ronald Reagan feted
him--with supreme contempt for the facts--as a freedom fighter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, the Angolan government was forced to grant free
elections, which Savimbi lost. Predictably, he resumed fighting.</TE>
<TE>   By then, stories were appearing in the Western press about his
reign of terror in territories he controlled. But this no longer
mattered. The Cold War was over, and Savimbi had lost his relevance.</TE>
<TE>   History is usually written by the victors. They have a tendency to
celebrate their good deeds and overlook the dark corners. The death
of Jonas Savimbi provides an opportunity to look again at our policy
in southern Africa during the Cold War and to reflect on our
inability to see him for what he really was.</TE>

<AU>ROBERT E. HUNTER</AU>
<BD>Robert E. Hunter, a senior advisor at the Rand Corp.,
was U.S. ambassador to NATO from 1993 to 1998.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the late 1940s, the United States concluded that two world wars
spawned in Europe were enough. It abandoned two centuries of avoiding
"entangling alliances" and took responsibility for the Continent's
future.</LD>
<LD>   What followed was the Marshall Plan, NATO, the European Economic
Community, and--after 40 years--the collapse of the Soviet Union and
history's first chance to create what President George H.W. Bush
called a "Europe whole and free."</LD>
<LD>   Along with its European allies, the United States now faces a
similar responsibility: to say "enough is enough" in the Middle East
and Southwest Asia and begin a decades-long commitment to help
fashion a region that is democratic, prosperous and at peace.</LD>
<TE>   The region stretching from the Mediterranean through at least
Afghanistan is a source of unending trouble and could be moving
toward catastrophe. The U.S. has been attacked by Middle East
terrorists who, if they can, will strike again. Israelis and Arabs
are killing one another at an unprecedented pace. An Iraqi dictator
who has used poison gas against his own and the Iranian people is
racing to gain even more awful weapons of mass destruction. Iran also
could be developing nuclear weapons. U.S. forces are still battling
Al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, democracy is in short supply in the region, and
disparities of income and economic development mock the stupendous
level of oil revenues. Different societies seem almost to be living
in different centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Enough is enough.</TE>
<TE>   Western indifference or episodic engagement is no longer an
option. The West cannot escape vital dependence on Middle East oil
and would be reckless to continue allowing the flow to be
periodically jeopardized. It cannot sit by while mass-destruction
weapons become the region's coin of the realm. Neither morally nor
politically can it continue to tolerate what Palestinians and
Israelis do to one another. At the same time, globalization is easing
the passage of various Middle East ills to Western shores; the reach
of weapons now extends beyond regional limits; and terrorism is being
tested as a counter to U.S. power and presence.</TE>
<TE>   It seems trite to prescribe a Marshall Plan for the Middle East
and Southwest Asia; certainly Western Europe and Western Asia are
vastly different. But America's European vocation went far beyond
economic reconstruction and development. It also entailed the
long-term commitment of outside strategic weight and presence;
diplomatic and military intervention to prevent, contain and stop
conflict; and the understanding that democracy is symbiotic with
economic prosperity, modern education, governments that earn popular
support and emerging hope in people's lives.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and its European allies should reach a compact of
commitment to sort out the Middle East and Southwest Asia, however
long it takes.</TE>
<TE>   To the West, the U.S. must pursue an all-out effort to stop the
fighting in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, and a full-court press
for peace diplomacy that starts now and keeps up until successful,
with all the power and influence at U.S. command.</TE>
<TE>   To the East, the U.S. and its allies must adopt Afghanistan as a
project and make it succeed, although that country may present the
hardest task in the region.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, Britain is scheduled to turn over leadership of a
limited peacekeeping force to Turkey and Germany. Instead, it should
hand off to a major force that is NATO-led and includes Russia--a
test for the full alliance to play an instrumental role in the war on
terrorism and for NATO-Russia to prove cooperation in practice. The
force's writ should extend far beyond Kabul. It should remain in
place until an Afghan government can provide stability. And it should
be buttressed by continuing aid for health, education and
development.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Russia, the West must also stop the spread of weapons
of mass destruction. Iraq is the first priority. But the U.S. should
disabuse itself that it can solve this problem alone. Neither can we
expect Americans to give unstinting support to a military campaign
with serious risk of casualties but without allies or a clear sense
of what comes after war.</TE>
<TE>   Military action may become unavoidable. But that must be the
end-point of a comprehensive non-proliferation strategy. There must
be shared assessments and decisions with European allies that could
lead to shared risks and responsibilities. And there must be
realistic plans to deal with the consequences of regime change in
Baghdad or Iraq's breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the region, the U.S. and its allies should try to
forestall Iranian weapons programs by seeking to draw that country
back into the international community. And they should encourage
Iranian efforts to end mullah dominance and to stay on course toward
the first-ever religious reformation of a Muslim society.</TE>
<TE>   The West should also commit to the region's economic progress and
its democratization--understanding that democratic change in secular
states like Syria and Egypt and religious states like Saudi Arabia
will not be overnight wonders.</TE>
<TE>   This vision for the Middle East and Southwest Asia--sizable,
costly and long-lasting in terms of commitment--is no guarantee that
sufficient reform is possible, that sources of conflict can be abated
or that something akin to the last half-century's European miracle
can be translated to this region.</TE>
<TE>   But we do know that episodic engagement has not worked and that
the dark side of globalization is getting steadily worse. We know
that prospects for peace are dwindling.</TE>
<TE>   Enough is enough.</TE>

<HD>Arming Pilots Is the Best Way to Get Air Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN R. LOTT Jr.</AU>
<BD>John R. Lott Jr. is a resident scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute and the author of "More Guns, Less Crime"
(University of Chicago Press, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His timing wasn't the best.</LD>
<LD>   The morning after U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta
announced that he opposed letting airline pilots have guns to guard
their cockpits--though he might consider stun guns--the Washington
Post reported "a declining number of federal air marshals are aboard
flights using Reagan National Airport."</LD>
<LD>   Despite repeated promises that all flights into the capital, with
its many vulnerable targets, would be guarded, pilots say the true
number is "quite a bit less than 100%" and falling.</LD>
<TE>   Worse, while the exact number of marshals has not been made
public, the same news report claimed that there were fewer than 1,000
across the nation, and only a fraction of those were available on any
given day. With most marshals apparently working in pairs, less than
1% of the 35,000 daily commercial flights in the U.S. are being
protected--hardly what we had hoped for six months after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   With increased preflight screening and passenger awareness, it may
be harder today for terrorists to take over a plane. But the reward
for terrorists also would be higher. Another successful attack would
destroy confidence in air travel. The airlines still are suffering
massive losses. And while Mineta's decision to rely on screening
passengers, strengthened cockpit doors and air marshals to prevent
terrorism is a good start, it is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   Inspections are hardly perfect. Again, the day after Mineta's
announcement, security was breached at Connecticut's Bradley
International Airport, forcing a plane in mid-flight to return to the
airport and have its passengers sent through metal detectors a second
time.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, knives, box cutters and long scissors have
regularly made it through security. As accused shoe bomber Richard C.
Reid demonstrated in December, tiny amounts of military explosives
such as C4 are easy to hide.</TE>
<TE>   When screening fails, armed marshals can help prevent hijackings.
Bill Landes at the University of Chicago found that between a third
and half of the drop in airplane hijackings during the 1970s could be
attributed to two factors: the introduction of armed U.S. marshals on
planes and the increased ability to catch and punish hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   But the process of recruiting enough marshals is slow and
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The marshals program would cost $10 billion per year and "require
a work force the size of the U.S. Marine Corps" to cover most planes,
according to the pilots' unions. Not only does it take a long time to
attract and train enough new marshals, but the program has had a
problem with retention. According to the Federal Aviation
Administration, marshals are finding the job incredibly boring as
they fly back and forth across the country, waiting for something to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   And the marshals program doesn't guarantee safety. Osama bin
Laden's organization was able to put five hijackers on each of three
planes and four on a fourth. With enough hijackers on a plane, they
could overpower two marshals.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does strengthening cockpit doors guarantee safety. Doors can
be blown open. Security can be breached, and terrorists could get the
keys or codes used to open the doors.</TE>
<TE>   So what else can be done? One choice is to arm pilots as a last
line of defense. Their job is not to police the entire airplane but
the much more limited and relatively simple task of defending a
single narrow entrance to keep terrorists out of the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two pilots unions, 83% of the Allied Pilots Assn. and 73%
of the Air Line Pilots Assn. support arming pilots. Seventy-eight
percent of the nonunionized Southwest Airlines Pilots' Assn. feel the
same way. More than 70% of the pilots at the major airlines have
served in the military and are familiar with guns. They know more
about their planes than the marshals.</TE>
<TE>   All three pilots groups have agreed to training programs before
being armed.</TE>
<TE>   Stun guns are not a serious alternative. The New York Police
Department found that stun guns fail to fell suspects 30% of the time
because of thick clothing or rubberized shoes. Fears of bullets
piercing the airplane's skin and causing it to lose pressure are
misplaced. Specialized bullets are designed not to penetrate the
airplane's aluminum skin. And even if a regular bullet penetrated the
skin, there is unlikely to be any noticeable change; an air outlet at
the back of the plane, which draws the air through the cabin, would
automatically shrink to a smaller size to compensate.</TE>
<TE>   Banning guns does not ban violence. It is the law-abiding citizens
who obey these rules, not the terrorists.</TE>

<HD>Will Davis' Plan to Thwart the GOP Work?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ETHAN RARICK</AU>
<BD>Ethan Rarick, a visiting scholar at the Institute of
Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley, is the author of "California
Rising: The Life and Times of Pat Brown," forthcoming from the
University of California Press.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Republicans have been quick to express their dreams for
this year's gubernatorial campaign. They hope that 2002 proves to be
a distant echo of 1966, when a Democratic incumbent meddled in the
GOP primary only to lose the general election.</LD>
<LD>   The incumbent 36 years ago--Pat Brown--wanted to get San Francisco
Mayor George Christopher, a moderate, out of the way so he could
instead face a conservative political newcomer Brown thought weaker.
Brown ended up losing to his hand-picked opponent, Ronald Reagan.
Republicans hope that the similar strategy used this year by Gov.
Gray Davis to knock off Richard Riordan will backfire on Davis.</LD>
<LD>   And it's true that there are some striking similarities. In 1966,
polls showed Christopher, like Riordan in 2002, was weak among
conservatives but that he had the best chance of beating the
incumbent in the fall. And Reagan, like Simon, was a conservative
favorite who had never been elected to public office.</LD>
<TE>   To do in Christopher, Democratic operatives dug up his old
conviction for violating milk-pricing laws--Christopher had once
owned a dairy--and leaked it to a friendly columnist. It was a minor
case, and one that had been used against Christopher before, but this
time it stuck. Christopher sank in the polls, never to fully recover.
A month later, Reagan won the primary and captured the Republican
nomination.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also some critical differences that suggest the
lessons of 1966 might not apply this year. For one thing, Pat Brown
was weaker than Gray Davis is today. Brown was seeking a third term,
not a second, and voters had simply grown tired of their paunchy,
affable governor.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, for all his troubles, Davis showed more early
strength this year, running slightly behind Riordan and far ahead of
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan, on the other hand, was from the beginning a far stronger
candidate than Simon or Riordan. His career as an actor, however
ridiculed, had made him a celebrity. More than a year before the
voting, polls showed him ahead of other potential GOP candidates, and
he never fell behind. Even without the subtle Democratic help, Reagan
might have won.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, California itself had experienced a
turbulent run-up to the 1966 campaign. The Free Speech Movement at
the UC's flagship Berkeley campus had launched the era of student
protests. A bitter and divisive initiative aimed at repealing the
state's fair housing law had pointed up racial divides. The 1965
Watts riot, in which 34 people died and more than 4,000 were
arrested, typified urban rage and despair. Campus protests against
the Vietnam War began to percolate. The result was an angry, restive
electorate ready to toss out the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   In fact it was Brown who faced a tougher primary fight than Reagan
when Democratic L.A. Mayor Sam Yorty, who ran to Brown's right,
drained off 42% of the vote. So it was the GOP, not the Democrats,
who emerged from the primary unified and ready for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Simon will have to attack Davis with
issues--high-priced energy contracts, a state budget deficit--that
carry a far lower emotional temperature. However bothersome, kilowatt
prices do not churn the gut like violence in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   On primary election night, Simon made the comparison to Reagan
explicit. The early Reagan, he said, was "short on experience, but
long on principle, vision and optimism." It was a nice try to tie
himself to the man who beat Pat Brown. But unless something changes
dramatically, it's more likely that in 2002, it's the California
Republicans, not the Democrats, who will have orchestrated a battle
they are destined to lose.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's PRI: Still Corrupt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) lost
the presidency for the first time in more than seven decades. In a
small act of contrition, the party's leadership told the citizenry it
got the message and would mend its ways. The overhaul was supposed to
start with a shining internal election for the next party head. Last
month's vote demonstrated only that the party is hopelessly corrupt.</LD>
<LD>   The two candidates pulled out every dirty campaign trick in the
book, then each accused the other of widespread ballot rigging. Those
charges may have been the only honest aspect of the election. To
produce the number of votes recorded at some places, for example,
voters would have had to move through the booths at a rate of one
every 30 seconds. In some places, one candidate got 120% of the
vote--an infamous PRI phenomenon known as the ''Soviet booth."</LD>
<LD>   Fair election or not, the controversial Roberto Madrazo is the
PRI's new president--and the party's most likely candidate for
Mexico's presidency in 2006. When he ran for governor of Tabasco, his
people engaged in intimidation, bought votes and stuffed ballot boxes
to get him elected. Worse, Madrazo allegedly spent millions of
dollars beyond the established campaign limits. And the local
electoral authorities did nothing to stop him.</LD>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine that the next presidential election will be a
repeat of past fraudulent elections. The national agency charged with
overseeing the vote did a thorough review of widespread cheating
techniques, then bolstered the system with elaborate controls. For
instance, every voter has an official identification card with his or
her picture, which is reproduced on lists at the voting booths. And
four trained officials, assigned at random, watch over every booth
alongside representatives from each party.</TE>
<TE>   The one remaining problem is that in Mexico, as in the United
States, campaign financing continues to corrode the democratic
process. So the government would be smart to give its election
oversight agency the ability to track transactions in private banks
and the treasury whenever there was credible suspicion that an
individual or corporation was illegally financing a campaign. Beyond
that, the PRI's inability to clean up its own act undermines the hard
work that President Vicente Fox, of the opposition PAN party, has
done to polish the country's image. Mexico's Congress and the
election agency need to nudge the nation back on course.</TE>

<LD>The fascinating and contentious field of human evolution was rocked
the other day by publication in the journal Nature of research by
Alan Templeton, a population biologist at Washington University in
St. Louis. For years scientists have generally believed that the
founders of modern humanity moved out of Africa suddenly about
100,000 years ago, obliterating prehuman species as the newcomers
wandered the world.</LD>
<LD>   Templeton's theory, based on computer DNA studies, suggests that
genetic mingling through interbreeding caused a series of global
melting-pot periods starting some 600,000 years ago and that traces
of early species like Neanderthals survive in modern human DNA. This
is great debate fodder for the journal Nature and conventions of
geneticists, which have evolved from crude cave gatherings to pretty
sophisticated PowerPoint presentations in air-conditioned hotels.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this narrow scientific debate ignores far more
convincing anecdotal data from detailed observations of family trips
to California during March school vacations. In a pioneering new
study being published right here now, we reveal what thousands of
Southern California families have noticed in recent generations.
Starting about half a century ago, relatives from cold northern
climates, even relatives unheard from for years, began migrating from
the Snowbelt around spring vacation time to the warmer weather of
California, where they moved into the homes of genetic and marital
relatives for much longer than expected, though not as long as it
seemed. This was discerned by carbon-dating host families' laundry
baskets, credit card charges and depleted food supplies. Scientists
studying visitors' diets were puzzled by a surfeit of pricey
restaurant foods. Further study of the contents of visitors' pockets
uncovered mummified admission tickets and parking stubs, also
overpriced.</TE>
<TE>   The historic migration, which resumes this month, was thus
conclusively tied to the evolution of California theme parks. The
more Disneylands, Knott's Berry Farms, Six Flags, SeaWorlds,
Legolands, Universal Studios, the greater the continental migration
of relatives professing family affinity--but displaying attributes of
the Early Moochers genus. These include a loud mouth, expansive
appetite, preference for the couch and apparent inability to open a
wallet. One aspect of Templeton's new study was, however, confirmed
in the California research: Many visitors do carry chromosomes
linking them to Neanderthals.</TE>

<LD>Leave it to Congress to pass an economic stimulus package at the very
moment that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says the
recession is over. The economy grew by 1.4% in the fourth quarter of
last year, and this quarter the figure may go as high as 4%.
Nevertheless, Sept. 11 did send unemployment up, and workers continue
to deserve a helping hand from the government. It is good news that
the stimulus package will extend unemployment benefits for 13 weeks
and that President Bush has promised to sign it speedily. The bad
news, alas, is that the bill is still larded with costly tax breaks
for big business.</LD>
<LD>   That there was any compromise at all on the measure is due to a
looming anniversary: March 11 marks six months since Sept. 11, and
those who lost their jobs in its wake were to soon come to the end of
their unemployment benefits. Embarrassed at the prospect, House
Republicans caved in on their most extreme demands for corporate tax
cuts, at which Democrats were balking. Democrats in turn gave up
health benefits for the jobless.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, the bill's corporate depreciation provision alone will
cost almost $97 billion, which is seven times the $14.4 billion
allotted to the unemployed over the next three years, according to
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This will also damage
state budgets. According to the National Governors Assn., the fiscal
situation of the states has steadily worsened and they already face a
total deficit of $40 billion to $50 billion. Most states peg
corporate tax rates to the federal code (California is an exception),
and they stand to lose billions more in the coming year from the new
depreciation rule. Unlike earlier proposed stimulus bills, this one
contains no state financial assistance to offset lost revenues.</TE>
<TE>   At least accelerated depreciation, supported by both parties,
stimulates corporate investment--unlike another,  more egregious
provision. This one extends for five years a tax loophole that allows
companies to avoid taxes on money earned abroad in banking, finance
and insurance, a rule that encourages multinationals to hide profits
through accounting tricks. It may help line the pockets of corporate
officers and shareholders, but it will not stimulate domestic
economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   It's always possible that Congress will roll back some of these
tax breaks in its next session, and certainly that's desirable. But
House Republicans have vowed not to retreat. They want to launch a
new crusade; House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, for instance, says he
wants to wipe out the inheritance tax permanently. Given this fervor,
the flawed stimulus package is just the very high price of extending
benefits for the unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   At least now the Senate is out of excuses on another piece of
legislation that's been needlessly bottled up. It's high time to call
a vote on campaign finance reform and pass it.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Boosting Allies' Military Aid," March 5: By continuing to
bomb an ousted regime in Afghanistan, and now with billions of
taxpayer dollars in giveaways to places like Indonesia, Uzbekistan
and a half-dozen other rat holes in the region, we are only fanning
the flames of hatred for America. If this administration doesn't stop
propagating its war-making machine in other Muslim countries, the
so-called evildoers who have made a pledge to God to destroy us will,
I fear, have their day of retribution, sooner or later.</LD>
<LD>   What makes our leaders think they can actually prevent a nuking of
New York? We hear that just such a threat was considered "credible"
by the administration last October, yet state and local officials
were never informed. Why? Because there was nothing they could have
done to stop it, only create panic.</LD>
<LD>   The only way to save ourselves is to stop military action in
Afghanistan, pull out of all Muslim countries (we can still watch
from space) and then focus all Defense Department resources on
homeland security, improved intelligence gathering and the covert,
surgical elimination of all terrorist organizations wherever they are
found.</LD>

<TE>   In response to those who wrote letters to The Times in support of
"Democrats Question a Widening War Effort" (letters, March 5), I have
a question: How many more World Trade Center events do you want
before you understand the absolute need for our all-out war on
terrorism?</TE>

<TE>   The present administration's war on terrorism should more properly
be called a war on terrorists. That objective is necessary and
correct at this point, but to fight terrorism and the causes of that
phenomenon requires more than bombs and the killing of some
gangsters. It requires a review of our policies that have helped
groups feed the flames of hatred against us. However, without that
review this war will never end.</TE>
<TE>   Our foreign policy seems to be run by the search for big bucks in
trade. We have been willing to support repressive governments
anywhere if it is profitable. We preach principles, but our actions
belie those principles and leave behind millions of people who listen
to us and decide we are hypocrites, or worse. I hope the
administration will begin to deal with the causes of terrorism, not
just the effects.</TE>

<TE>   Every person who has expressed any concern or sympathy for the
treatment of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay should be ashamed of
themselves and sickened by their misguided empathy ("Navy SEAL Was
Captured and Killed," March 6). These people have been loudly
chastising our government that these prisoners don't have ample
living space, haven't been given the right atmosphere for their daily
prayers or aren't being served the correct food. Well, we now know
exactly how the Al Qaeda and Taliban treat their prisoners of war.
They take the prisoner behind a bush, put a bullet through his head
and throw his body back in the open for his buddies to collect.</TE>

<LD>California may be a statistically diverse state, but you would never
know it by looking at the election results in the statewide offices.
The Democrats (pretty sure bets to win in the general election) have
a slate with only one Latino, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, breaking the
all-white male lineup at the top of the state.</LD>
<LD>   Latino power? Women power? A government that reflects the
diversity of the state? If that were true, 85.7% of the state would
be white men and 14.3% Latino men. That's it, folks. Guess we had
better not celebrate just yet.</LD>
<LD>   Of course a Democrat (Gray Davis) may have won the Republican
primary, so what can we say.</LD>

initiative, Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) publicly
announced that he would continue to fight to overturn our term limits
laws. What arrogance! Assemblyman Wesson, the people have spoken; we
want term limits, get over it. District 47 voters, are you listening?
Your own assemblyman doesn't care about the will of the people.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Clinton Could Have Been Convicted, Prosecutor Contends," March 7:
Having thoroughly skimmed independent counsel Robert W. Ray's short
report on the Monica Lewinsky witch hunt, I'm amazed that he and his
staff had the gall to take 13 months to release it. It should have
been completed and released in much less than half the time.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly it is written as a partisan screed. The Republicans'
opinion that they could have gotten a conviction against President
Clinton is worse than worthless, as is their defense of Ken Starr's
bullies. The most disgusting fact is that their partisan screed on
the long-dead Whitewater witch hunt still hasn't been released.</LD>
<LD>   If the press hadn't compromised itself over the years by taking
sensational leaks from these second-rate partisan schemers, Ray and
his operatives wouldn't still be getting away with ripping off the
taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   Roses Prichard</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ray's attempt at self-promotion is too pathetic. And shame on you
and all the media! For the first time, but regrettably on Page A12,
have you properly described the laws allegedly violated by President
Clinton and, more important, accurately stated that there was no
basis for the charges or any possible conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the media, in their lust for sexy news fueled by the need for
ratings, dug their teeth into Clinton and didn't let go. It was the
media that facilitated Starr and the House in wasting time and money,
distracting the presidency and wreaking lifelong havoc with people's
lives.</TE>
<TE>   The firing of Mike Parker ("Army Official Ousted After
Criticisms," March 7) because he criticized the Bush administration
is the more important story.</TE>

<HD>Medical Insurers Gouge Their Clients</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As they say in Hollywood, the Nevada issue in "Physicians Fold Under
Malpractice Fee Burden" (March 4) is deja vu all over again.</LD>
<LD>   In 1975, my major project as public relations counsel for the
California Trial Lawyers Assn. was to counter the insurance
industry/medical profession's joint assault on medical malpractice
cases. The campaign was launched by the carrier that issued most of
the liability policies, which suddenly and without prior notice began
increasing premiums fourfold and more.</LD>
<LD>   Today's headlines are eerily familiar. The insurer blamed premium
increases on excessive jury verdicts for outrageous, unwarranted
claims. By the time we obtained documented proof that the real reason
for the premium gouging was the fact that the insurer had sustained
heavy losses the previous year in a stock market plunge and was
seeking to restore its financial reserves, the Legislature had been
hornswoggled into passing the medical malpractice reform act, which
put a cap on awards.</LD>
<TE>   Now, I read that the Nevada insurer that is rocking the boat is
believed to have suffered heavy losses in Enron stock (March 5).

<LD>   When a "religious" movement can cause any kind of debate at all
within the Congress of the most advanced technological country in the

to a person "who says he flies around in flying saucers"?</LD>

<LD>Re "First Test of the Biotech Age: Human Cloning," Commentary, March
6: William Kristol and Jeremy Rifkin articulate the consensus of a
very influential and reactionary movement, spanning left and right,
that wants to stop human progress and substantial improvement of our
species where it counts most: the human genome.</LD>
<LD>   I too believe in the intrinsic value of human life, so much so
that I want it better for myself, for my neighbors and for those who
will follow us in centuries to come. Genetic engineering, by
producing healthier, stronger, smarter people, affirms that intrinsic
value of life.</LD>
<LD>   People in the reactionary camp contend that children are, to use
Kristol and Rifkin's words, "a gift bestowed by God or a beneficent
nature." What kind of a "gift" is a child with Down syndrome? What
kind of an endowment is brain and brawn that will never earn more
than the minimum wage, condemning tens of millions to poverty?</LD>
<TE>   The greatest gift is the one we can give to ourselves in the form
of "engineered" reproductions, not uniform in appearance, but
universally excellent. The question is, do we have the wisdom and the
political and moral will to say, "Go for it"?</TE>

<HD>Medal Shortage at L.A. Marathon</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While organizers did many things well on the 17th annual L.A.
Marathon, March 3, one tragic misstep was their unconscionable
miscount of winner's medals. All finishers are promised a medal, but
this year's organizers ran out of medals with hundreds (possibly
thousands?) of runners still coming in. After contending with a newly
designed course featuring a dangerously narrow start in which several
runners went down, then conquering the heartbreak hills ascending the
last miles, finishers in the middle and back of the pack were treated
to the words, "You'll get your medal in a few weeks. Maybe." Talk
about grasping defeat from the jaws of victory! How sad that a moment
of triumph was turned into a moment of disappointment for so many who
had worked so hard.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 1% of the population will ever attempt a marathon.
Witnessing the treatment of ordinary mortals who braved the half-hour
bomb threat delay, record heat and the aforementioned "course
improvements" only to shamble home empty-handed, it's easy to see why
we have so many couch potatoes.</LD>

<LD>Re "Soccer Is Kicking Into L.A.'s Future," Commentary, March 3: As a
Galaxy fan, I was at least as happy as Frank del Olmo about the
groundbreaking of the soccer stadium in Carson last week. So I was
disappointed to read a couple of misapprehensions on his part. The
Coliseum has proven again and again its complete unfitness to host
top-quality soccer events. The reason for this is entirely due to the
Coliseum Commission and its unwillingness to provide soccer fans with
basic security. I'll leave it to Del Olmo to decide why USC fans have
more than adequate security while soccer fans don't.</LD>
<LD>   Del Olmo apparently feels the Galaxy plays in a so-so league. What
part of "Los Angeles Galaxy, reigning champions of North America"
does he not understand?</LD>

<LD>I find the almost total neglect by all the media to inform the public
about the impending, serious decision to possibly extend the deadline
for the ban on toxic MTBE in gasolines at year-end very puzzling and
unfortunate. Any delay could result in continued seepage of MTBE into
our water supply, and the consequences could be far more serious to
the health of--and the cost to--all citizens of California. I hope
this subject will be publicly vetted soon as a public service or
obligation by the media.</LD>

<HD>Cautious Simon Won't Be Mouthing Off, but Might Need to
Speak Up</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   It was a simple question I lobbed Bill Simon last May. A softball.
Easy to hit.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you for the death penalty?" I asked him at a Republican
fund-raising event.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd rather keep that off the record," the political novice
replied. "I am, but I want to come up to speed first before answering
on the record."</TE>
<TE>   Whoaaa! Here's a conservative who wants to be the Republican
nominee for governor, but can't say publicly whether he's for the
death penalty? Being pro-execution is a must for any gubernatorial
candidate in California, regardless of party.</TE>
<TE>   Walk down any street, ask practically anybody and you'll hear a
clear view of the death penalty. But not from this former federal
prosecutor?</TE>
<TE>   Last week, after he'd captured the GOP nomination in a stunning
upset, I asked Simon again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pro death penalty," he quickly answered. "I believe the death
penalty is appropriate under certain circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   What would he think of a moratorium--as there is in
Illinois--until experts can determine whether there are adequate
safeguards to protect innocent people from being executed?</TE>
<TE>   "Not at this point," he said. "I'm kind of fond of the law as it
stands. I'm comfortable with the amount of discretion a governor has
with clemency." (Same position as Gov. Gray Davis.)</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't he just say that last May?</TE>
<TE>   Because his advisors had not thoroughly briefed him on capital
punishment, Simon replied. Maybe there were tricky details that had
escaped him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't afraid of answering your first question. What I was
worried about was maybe your second or third questions that I
wouldn't be competent to address because I hadn't thought it
through."</TE>
<TE>   But today he wouldn't duck a question on such a gut issue, would
he?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I might. I might."</TE>
<TE>   So what this story tells us about Simon is that his mouth will not
be running out of control as he challenges Davis. He'll speak and
step cautiously, heeding his advisors--unlike the last GOP
gubernatorial nominee, Dan Lungren. Unlike Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   More like Ronald Reagan. The actor took direction and followed the
script, although he definitely created his own story line and
believed in it.</TE>
<TE>   Skip the Reagan analogies being spun by Simonites, however. Yes,
neither Reagan nor Simon had sought any public office before they ran
for governor. They're both conservatives. They're likable. They have
similar hairstyles (parted on opposite sides). But there the
similarities end.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Simon, Reagan long had been politically active and was very
well known to the public. He exuded warmth and also generated fire.
He excited emotions.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike Simon, despite folklore, Reagan never was significantly
helped during the Republican primary by the Democratic governor.</TE>
<TE>   It also was a far different era when Reagan trounced Gov. Pat
Brown. The civil rights movement, campus rebellions and emerging
antiwar protests had fractured the Democratic Party. Abortion and
guns were barely mentioned. The environment was only a budding issue.</TE>
<TE>   Today California Democrats are unified. And recently they've been
pummeling Republican candidates with the litmus test issues of
abortion rights, gun control and environmental protection.</TE>
<TE>   Simon will try to keep his mouth muted about these things. Davis
will try to goad him into defending his positions.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP nominee favors abortion only in cases of rape, incest and
threat to the mother's life. But when pressed, he'll note that
abortion is legal and pledge: "I'm not going to do anything to try to
disturb the law. I'm not going to be an activist governor when it
comes to abortion."</TE>
<TE>   This simple assurance--combined with a perpetual smile, soft voice
and telegenic looks--will make him less scary than some other
right-wingers.</TE>
<TE>   Heeding advisors, Simon will attempt to shift every campaign
conversation toward the economy, energy, education and spending.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see a path [to victory]," he says. "The path is to focus on
what Gray has done to the state....</TE>
<TE>   "And stay humble. I don't want everybody [on the staff] running
around thinking they're geniuses now that we happened to win [the
primary]."</TE>
<TE>   Reagan used to say it's hard to hit a home run off a soft pitch.
Simon may need to swing more aggressively at pitches of all speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Caution can be commendable, but heartfelt, hard-hitting
declarations--vicious murderers deserve to die--can connect with
voters, convey commitment and project leadership.</TE>
<TE>   And we're way past getting away with "off the record."</TE>

<HD>A. Eicoff, 80; Ad Exec Created Infomercials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alvin M. Eicoff, a Chicago advertising executive who pioneered
late-night television commercials that demonstrated products and
urged viewers to rush to the phone to order them--a model for modern
infomercials--has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Eicoff, who maintained homes in Chicago and Highland Beach, Fla.,
died March 2 in Highland Beach of congestive heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   An expert on direct-response advertising, Eicoff wrote the book on
the technique in 1982. He called it "... or Your Money Back," the
phrase he insisted be included at the end of every one of his
commercials.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Lewiston, Mont., Alvin Maurey Eicoff began his career in
radio in the 1940s, producing ads for Flypel fly spray and D-Con rat
poison. He moved into television in the medium's infancy, employing
carnival barker-type pitchmen to sell real estate in Arizona and
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   He specialized in selling goods for small clients, but also had
larger accounts, including Columbia House records for which he
produced his most successful commercial. It ran for 15 years, selling
the company's "101 Great Moments in Music" recordings.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial opened with orchestral music and an actor saying:
"You may think this song is Tony Bennett's 'Strangers in Paradise,'
but it is really the Polovtsian Dance No. 8 by Alexander Borodin."</TE>
<TE>   Eicoff, who founded his A. Eicoff &amp; Co. in 1965 (bought by Ogilvy
&amp; Mather in 1981), stressed sales effectiveness and eschewed
currently popular short commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the 120-second commercial," Eicoff once said. "We need 30
seconds for the tag line, and we have to leave the number on the
screen long enough to make an impression. We'd bomb with 10 seconds."</TE>
<TE>   He also scoffed at high prices charged for ads on the Super Bowl
and other highly watched programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The worse the show, the better the return," he said in 1970,
explaining that a viewer interested in a show will not rush to the
telephone to order what he sees advertised.</TE>
<TE>   And he clearly preferred the late-night spots, explaining that the
bleary-eyed viewers were the best buyers: "If they are tired, their
subconscious will accept without their consciousness fighting it."</TE>
<TE>   Eicoff is survived by his wife, Helene; and two sons, Jeffrey and
Larry.</TE>

<DH>Media: Sex predators' journal alleges abuses at Atascadero
State Hospital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Most every month, Lawrence Halbert shines a tell-all light from
inside one of California's most closeted societies: the sexually
violent predator ward at Atascadero State Hospital where he is
confined.</LD>
<LD>   With pen, paper and an electric typewriter, the 43-year-old Bay
Area native and a handful of other convicted rapists and child
molesters publish Echoes of the Gulag, a 600-circulation monthly that
challenges the enigmatic doctors and psychologists who dominate
nearly every aspect of their day-to-day lives.</LD>
<LD>   What began in 2000 as a simple legal advice sheet circulated among
patients has evolved into an aggressive, unauthorized journal that is
now forbidden reading among hospital staffers. One employee union has
contacted a lawyer to get the Gulag shut down, and prisoners say the
hospital has even confiscated copies of a recent issue.</LD>
<TE>   Where inmate writers see themselves as muckrakers whose work
provides therapy for fellow patients, administrators dismiss them as
dangerous malcontents whose aim is to intimidate hospital staff.</TE>
<TE>   "We're shining a light they don't want to see, especially from
people they've written off as insane," Halbert said in a telephone
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Under such headlines as "Spin Doctor!" and "Whom Can You Trust?"
the underground journal reports on allegations of attacks by staff,
forced medication and substandard conditions inflicted on patients at
the high-security ward 200 miles south of here.</TE>
<TE>   Stories question the credentials of staff physicians and report on
what inmates call an unjust state law--which was argued last week
before the California Supreme Court--that forces patients termed
sexually violent predators, or SVPs, to remain inside a mental ward
even after they've completed prison sentences for their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Run by an editorial board consisting of Halbert, a former
cabinetmaker, along with an SVP who is a geologist and another who is
a former weekly newspaper owner, the Gulag is compiled on the ward
from inmate submissions that arrive on napkins and shreds of
cardboard.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the written stories are smuggled out of Atascadero for
production and then spirited back inside the hospital as a four-page,
black-and-white newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "This newsletter is part of these patients' pathology," said
hospital spokeswoman Barrie Hafler. "It's a product of only a handful
of people. But it occupies time that could be better spent on
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Some psychologists, defense lawyers and historians disagree,
applauding the publication as a feisty news outlet that dares to
operate in a hyper-controlled environment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most important kind of speech the Constitution can
protect," said lawyer Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties
Union. "It's the very definition of political free speech by inmates
who believe they are being held illegally. It's an emotional outlet."</TE>
<TE>   Others argue that even convicted sex offenders need a voice. "The
Gulag offers these inmates hope--as reporters they're no longer
stumbling around in the dark," said Mike Aye, an attorney who posts
the Gulag on his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "They may have done some lousy things in life. Some may need to be
locked up, some not. But they're still human beings and they need to
be treated as such."</TE>
<TE>   John Podboy agrees. The psychologist once served on a state board
overseeing sexually violent predators before quitting in protest in
1996. Now he's a Gulag reader.</TE>
<TE>   "They're scrappy in their reporting--they have friends outside the
hospital check on the credentials of the staff, who in some cases
have been less than forthcoming," Podboy said. "They closely watch
legislation and provide a real service to patients."</TE>
<TE>   Halbert likens himself to Randle P. McMurphy, the nonconformist in
Ken Kesey's 1962 novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" who led a
motley crew of mental patients to question authority at their asylum.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Kesey's fictional hero, these sociopaths deserve to be
locked up right where they are, hospital officials say. To be
declared a sexually violent predator, an inmate must have committed
rape at least twice.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the newsletter was funded by a public defender's
association, and a Sacramento defense lawyer has posted some issues
on the Internet at www.oldsaclaw.com. Hospital workers counter with
Gulag complaints at www.psych-health.com/gulag01.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Like Halbert, all 400 patients at the ward are held under a
controversial state law that allows authorities to keep sexual
sociopaths locked up beyond completion of their penitentiary
sentences unless doctors agree that they are not a threat to society.</TE>
<TE>   Halbert calls the Gulag a shot of self-esteem adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   "Most staffers avoided eye contact with us and saw us as what one
termed 'sociopathic subhumans of the first stripe,'" he said. "But
now they see we're not just drooling lunatics."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the Gulag is among the last of a breed of prison
journalism. Most famous is the Angolite, which in 1979 won the
prestigious George Polk Award when two inmates serving life terms
wrote about conditions inside the Louisiana State Prison at Angola.</TE>
<TE>   California has closed publications at San Quentin and Vacaville
prisons, declaring them disruptive to inmates, said James McGrath
Morris, author of "Jailhouse Journalism: The Fourth Estate Behind
Bars."</TE>
<TE>   News journals published at mental hospitals are rarer. "Most
periodicals in mental institutions involve creative writing, so one
that does real reporting is an incredibly rare beast," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   The newsletter was started in 2000 by a former prison law library
clerk who performed research for fellow patients. When he suffered a
stroke later that year, others decided to keep the publication alive.
Unlike their predecessor, who provided only legal items, they
reported on events at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   One story described how a patient "repeatedly asked staff to bring
him his wheelchair so he could telephone his mother. Staff refused,
thereby forcing [him] to crawl the 90 feet from his cell to the
telephone in the day room [while] staff stood in the glass-enclosed
office and watched in amusement."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital denies the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a satire of the newsletter that prisoners believe was
circulated by hospital staff was circulated on the sexual predator
ward. Called "I Hear Voices From the Echoes, Too," it spoofed Gulag
stories and claimed to have been funded by a fictitious California
District Attorney's Assn. Hafler could not confirm the event and
Halbert said hospital officials never discovered who printed the
flier.</TE>
<TE>   "The staff snickered, but we saw it as a compliment that someone
would to go to that effort to spoof us," he said. "We knew we were
having an effect."</TE>

<LD>The word spread quickly through the teams of workers hammering nails
and mixing drywall at the sun-drenched Camarillo construction site.</LD>
<LD>   "It's almost time for the Watchtower reading," said a young man in
a hard hat as he strode with a group of workers to a brief prayer
service.</LD>
<LD>   For the last four weekends, Jehovah's Witnesses from across

paint--along with stacks of Watchtower booklets--to Camarillo for
what they say is their latest contribution to God's grand plan.</LD>

dusty patch of weeds and dirt along the Ventura Freeway into the 53rd
Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall in the Ventura County-Los Angeles
area.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just part of our worship," said Camarillo resident Kim
Arther, a soft-spoken church elder and a building inspector for the
city of Los Angeles. "Those that worship God always build."</TE>
<TE>   And they're not done, Arther said.</TE>
<TE>   Next weekend, church members will be back on the construction site
nailing down carpet and cleaning up the area that became a de facto
weekend home to hundreds of volunteers beginning in early February.</TE>
<TE>   While some workers are putting the finishing touches on the
building's stucco walls, others will begin hauling away refrigerators
and serving tables that were part of a makeshift kitchen set up to
feed the crews.</TE>
<TE>   Church members expect to hold their first services at the hall
March 28, Arther said.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as they finish work in Camarillo, the more than 700
volunteers will head to Lancaster to build the church's 54th hall.
The network of volunteers--all church members--includes dozens of
licensed electricians, plumbers, pipe fitters and masons, Arther
said.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as a 21st century version of a 19th century barn
raising, said Jeff Jackman, a Camarillo resident who serves as one of
the new hall's 14 elders.</TE>
<TE>   More importantly, Jackman and other congregation members said, the
new hall could go a long way toward casting aside stereotypes of
Jehovah's Witnesses as front-porch proselytizers who refuse blood
transfusions, ignore most holidays and refuse to vote or fight in
wars.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people view us from the doorstep, and the standard response
is, 'We're not interested,"' Jackman said. "But we're there to share
our life and hope for the future of this planet. If people understood
the function of our ministry, they would be more willing to listen."</TE>
<TE>   The 5,800-square-foot site was not the first choice for the
congregation, Arther said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, church officials applied to build a hall on Mission Drive
near Nancy Street in a heavily residential section. But residents of
the neighborhood surrounding the proposed church site aired their
concerns about traffic, and the Camarillo Planning Commission
rejected the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Church members sold that property and purchased the current site
in 1999 for about $83,000. The total cost of the project is estimated
at $700,000, Arther said.</TE>
<TE>   The property, tucked between the freeway, a mobile home park and a
strawberry field just north of Pleasant Valley Road, was unwanted
until the Jehovah's Witnesses came along, said Steve Mitchell, an
associate planner for the Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the land has been used as a community garden and
nursery but mostly sat vacant as a buffer zone between the mobile
home park and the freeway, said Bob Burrow, Camarillo's director of
community development.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the most desirable location," Mitchell said. "People
would ask about it and we would tell them what they could do with it
and we would never see them again. It was nice to see people carry
through with a project we can be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   The hall will include a 200-seat auditorium for the 114-member
congregation as well as adjoining meeting rooms and a one-bedroom
apartment for church members who travel among congregations.</TE>
<TE>   In compliance with the city's Heritage Zone requirements set up
for developments along the freeway, the hall will have a Spanish tile
roof to go along with an early California theme, Burrow said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the main worship area of the hall, Reseda plumbing
contractor Randall Press said that building a church for fellow
Jehovah's Witnesses--for free--brings him a satisfaction he can't get
from a paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "On every project, I have come away with some really good friends
for a lifetime," Press said. "Every once in a while it kicks in that
this is an unusual arrangement, that we are doing it [as volunteers].
It creates a sense of community."</TE>

<HD>Merger of Dissimilar Desert Cities Proposed</HD>
<DH>Government: Backers say Palm Springs brings cachet to deal,
Cathedral City offers room for growth. Skeptics scoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>As the San Fernando Valley grapples with the prospect of seceding
from Los Angeles, here in the desert there is talk of going the
opposite way: joining Palm Springs with neighboring Cathedral City.</LD>
<LD>   In a move that caught local officials by surprise, a political
action committee two weeks ago proposed that the cities unite to form
the biggest municipality--with about 90,000 residents--in the small
but growing Coachella Valley. Palm Springs' flashy star-studded
reputation, they argue, would blend well with Cathedral City's
developable land.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50% of voters in both cities would have to approve the
proposal.</LD>
<TE>   The Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission is taking
the proposal seriously, noting that such a consolidation would be
California's first in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Backers say the plan would cut costs and boost both cities' clout,
and are circulating a petition to get the proposal on the 2003
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "When we started looking at consolidation, it was amazing how much
money we'll be able to save by erasing a fictitious line in the sand
that divides the two cities,'' said Craig Marlar, secretary of the De
Ville Group, the Palm Springs-based committee pushing the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents notified LAFCO on Feb. 12 that they intend to circulate
a consolidation petition. To put the measure on the ballot, they need
signatures from 5% of registered voters in each city--a total of
1,771. They must also submit an application spelling out the costs
and benefits of consolidation, details that critics say are currently
lacking. LAFCO would then conduct a public hearing, and unless half
the voters in each city objected in writing, the consolidation
proposal would go on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   If a majority of voters in each city approved it, the
consolidation would be complete--a first in California since San Jose
and Alviso united in 1972, said Raechelle Cline of the League of
California Cities.</TE>
<TE>   So far, officials in both cities have been cool to the
consolidation plan, under which the Palm Springs name would be
retained but the existing city councils would be dissolved and a new
council would be elected.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised that the whole thing came up," said Bob Hillery, a
former Cathedral City mayor and board member of the Palm Springs
Historical Society, who said the plan was all but unknown before the
local paper publicized it. "I don't know why it came up. Even members
of city councils hadn't heard of it.''</TE>
<TE>   In some quarters, the proposal is also raising concern because it
has been presented by the De Ville Group as part of a slate of other
measures. One of the original proponents, former Palm Springs City
Manager Rob W. Parkins, has pulled his name off the consolidation
petition, saying he does not wish to champion the other proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The group is calling for term limits on elected officials in Palm
Springs, a repeal of the city's 5% utility tax, reform of its parking
system and a switch from the city's elected mayoral seat to a
rotating council position, Marlar said. It is also backing a
statewide initiative to allow Indian casino-style gaming at already
licensed racetracks and card clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have a difference of opinion with those, and wasn't asked
if I was going to subscribe to those,'' Parkins said. "I would not
have [agreed to be a consolidation petitioner] if I knew there was
the perception that this would be linked to those.''</TE>
<TE>   The consolidation proposal, however, seems to make a natural
match, say proponents, who describe it as a marriage of equals, with
each city bringing its unique wealth to the union.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs is the grande dame of the desert, renowned for its
Rat Pack connection and Albert Frey architecture. Cathedral City is
an up-and-coming bedroom community with affordable housing, a sleek
new civic center and room to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs has trendy restaurants and intimate boutiques.
Cathedral City has Wal-Mart, Target and Sam's Club. Palm Springs has
the airport. Cathedral City has the auto mall.</TE>
<TE>   Combining the cities would give them added leverage when vying
with other desert cities for coveted developments such as golf
courses and shopping malls. And it could save as much as $7 million
to $15 million a year by consolidating staff and services, Marlar
said.</TE>
<TE>   The details of such a union could be an unwieldy mess, some local
officials caution. They're warning residents against signing the
petition without knowing how the two cities would share fire and
police services, merge their respective library systems and reconcile
differing local taxes and budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like signing a blank check, or signing a letter without
anything typed on it,'' said Palm Springs Mayor Will Kleindienst, who
said he was only dimly aware of the proposal in the weeks before its
public announcement late last month. "It's not prudent."</TE>
<TE>   Finances and politics aside, some critics say there's a cultural
divide across the city lines. Cathedral City is a suburb largely of
young Latino families, and Palm Springs is a haven for white
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   "The philosophy of both people are different," Hillery said. "The
ones that want to live in Palm Springs are looking for the
aristocratic development, more of the nightclub scene. And the ones
in Cathedral City are working-class."</TE>
<TE>   Consolidation proponent and former Cathedral City Councilman
Robert Gomer, however, sees the cities as two sides of the same coin,
with their interconnected businesses, large tracts of Agua Caliente
tribal land and substantial gay communities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any difference between someone that lives on one side
of the street and someone who lives on the other side of the street,"
he said. "We're very much intertwined with the way the populations
live and work and play.''</TE>
<TE>   But for some desert residents who retreated from urban areas in
search of a quieter life, the two small cities would simply be too
big as one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would work great, but it would never go," said former
Palm Springs Mayor Frank Bogert. "If it comes up to a vote, I
guarantee that people would vote against it.</TE>
<TE>   "They just want to keep their own little town."</TE>

<HD>Don Haig, 68; Producer Boosted Canada Film Industry</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Haig, who helped produce a number of award-winning films in
Canada and was known as the godfather of that country's film
industry, died March 2 of cancer at his Toronto home. He was 68.</LD>
<LD>   Haig was former head of English production at Canada's National
Film Board, and filmmakers credited him with helping aspiring talent
by loaning money, assessing their scripts and editing their films.</LD>
<LD>   "He was arguably the most important person on the Canadian film
scene because he encouraged so many people and made their films
possible," said Geoff Pevere, film critic for the Toronto Star.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Winnipeg in 1933, Haig moved to Toronto in 1956 and first
worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s television film
department.</TE>
<TE>   He left CBC in 1962 and began his own company a year later. He was
a co-founder of the Canadian Film Editors Guild in 1970 and chairman
of the Canadian Film and Television Assn. in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Haig joined the National Film Board in 1992.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Finds Distant Taker for Sludge</HD>
<DH>Environment: Human waste product is a tough sell for
sanitation district that doesn't treat it to the level required by
state's agricultural counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Running out of places willing to take the sludge left over from
sewage treatment, the Orange County Sanitation District is trucking
it to an Indian tribe's farmland 270 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Dale Wakimoto, farm manager for the Fort Mojave tribe, said the
reservation will save $100 an acre on commercial fertilizer by using
the sludge on its vast acreage in eastern San Bernardino County. The
tribe will be paid about $6,000 a month for accepting the sludge.</LD>
<LD>   Sludge is the solid matter left over after the sanitation district
treats sewage, extracting and cleansing the water. Farmers say the
sludge is valuable fertilizer. But concerned about the smell and dust
given off by the human waste, agricultural counties throughout the
state are banning its use unless it is treated to a higher level to
kill disease-causing bacteria and other microorganisms.</LD>
<TE>   Farmers and industry officials say that as fertilizer, sludge
results in higher yields and cuts water use on agricultural fields,
and that public perception rather than evidence of any harm has led
to the bans.</TE>
<TE>   "The material does nothing other than benefit the farming
community in more ways than you can count. It's a wonderful product
for the farmers," said Laurie Loter, spokeswoman for Synagro
Technologies Inc., the contractor that hauls the sludge to the
reservation.</TE>
<TE>   Wakimoto said health and aesthetic concerns aren't an issue for
his farm because the closest home to the fields is a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not too certain that the health concerns are really a
relevant issue.... I think the science is there. I think the safety
is there," he said. "It provides us the fertilizer that we need."</TE>
<TE>   The Fort Mojave tribe is using the fertilizer to get larger
harvests of alfalfa, cotton and Bermuda grass, which will be used as
dairy feed.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District, which collects and treats
sewage for northern and central Orange County, creates 541 wet tons a
day of the coal-black sludge. (A wet ton is about 500 pounds.)</TE>
<TE>   But the county has been running out of places to send its sludge,
especially after Riverside County recently banned its use on farms
there. At least 18 other counties in the state have similar
restrictions. However, the counties would accept sludge treated to a
cleaner level. Using sludge as fertilizer is common across the nation
and supported by the Environmental Protection Agency. About 40% of
the more than 5 million dry tons produced in 2000 was used as
fertilizer. However, the agency has asked the National Academy of
Sciences to review potential health risks.</TE>
<TE>   Critics argue that the district shouldn't be sending it anywhere,
but should be treating it further on site.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trucking it to an Indian reservation ... and they still
don't get it," environmentalist Doug Korthof said. "If it's such good
stuff, why can't they find closer places to stick it?"</TE>
<TE>   Orange County sewage officials are taking steps toward removing
more disease-causing bacteria, viruses and toxic metals so the sludge
will qualify as "Class A." This highly treated sludge can be used as
fertilizer in much of California. But this more thorough
treatment--likely to be composting or chemical stabilization--is
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's transitioning to Class A technology," said Brent
McManigal, Synagro's senior operations director. "That will take time
and money and permits, which don't always mesh with the time frames
dictated by the counties."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the district spent $3.2 million buying an 1,800-acre
ranch in central California to dump its sludge, only to have Kings
County ban the sludge, starting in 2003. The sewage agency still will
be able to send more thoroughly treated sludge there.</TE>
<TE>   The district has been paying a landowner in San Bernardino County
$500 a day for the last six months in hopes of someday buying that
land for a composting facility, but the district is backing away
after an accounting report said the deal was risky.</TE>
<TE>   So in mid-December, the district began paying Synagro $39.50 per
wet ton to truck about one-third of its sludge to the Fort Mojave
tribe, which receives $2 per wet ton.</TE>
<TE>   The farm also receives small amounts of sludge from two agencies
in Riverside County, and a southern Orange County agency. The tribe's
reservation stretches across more than 33,000 acres of California,
Arizona and Nevada, but the sludge will be used only on the
California portion.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe is not bound by federal and state sludge rules. However,
the sanitation district is requiring the tribe to follow both. One
San Bernardino County ordinance is being violated, because the sludge
is being applied about 500 feet from a farm well. County law requires
a 1/2-mile buffer.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the district's sludge goes to Kings and Kern
counties.</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Plan Meant to Deter</HD>
<DH>Defense: Newly revealed contingencies are designed to make clear
that biological and chemical attacks 'would be met with a devastating
response,' Rice says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S officials on Sunday defended the Pentagon's contingency plans
for expanded use of nuclear weapons, saying the intent is to deter other
nations from using biological or chemical weapons against Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration wants to "send a very strong signal to anyone
who might try to use weapons of mass destruction against the United
States," National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on NBC's "Meet
the Press."</LD>
<LD>   "The only way to deter such a use is to be clear it would be met with
a devastating response," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell described the policy as "prudent
military planning," not a plan for imminent attack.</TE>
<TE>   "There are nations out there developing weapons of mass destruction.
Prudent planners have to give some consideration as to the range of
options the president should have available to him to deal with these
kinds of threats," Powell said on CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   The White House was responding to a Los Angeles Times story Saturday
that revealed that the Pentagon has drawn up plans that arms control
experts say could signal a reversal of a decades-long policy of
relegating nuclear weapons to a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to new threats since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
Bush administration now wants to consider using nuclear weapons to
respond to biological and chemical attacks, as well as nuclear strikes,
on the U.S. or its allies. They also are contemplating using smaller
weapons that can better target new challenges faced in war zones: deeply
dug caves and reinforced bunkers.</TE>
<TE>   Arms control advocates warn that such moves could destabilize world
relations by encouraging other nations to develop such weapons, but some
conservative analysts say the Pentagon must prepare for a changed world,
where dozens of countries, and some terrorist groups, have secret weapon
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The classified Pentagon report cited five nations--Iraq, North Korea,
Iran, Libya and Syria--as posing a new level of threat to the United
States that could require a nuclear response. The report also cites
nuclear powers Russia and China but makes clear that Russia is no longer
considered a U.S. adversary.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure of U.S. nuclear contingency planning could complicate
diplomacy efforts by Vice President Dick Cheney, who arrived in London on
Sunday for a 10-day, 12-nation swing through Europe and the Middle East
to discuss with allies the next phase of the U.S.-led war against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials went out of their way Sunday to assert that
military planners have not targeted any nation for a nuclear attack but
rather are preparing for how to respond if others resort to weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, today, not a single nation on the face of the Earth is
being targeted by an American nuclear weapon on a day-to-day basis,"
Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell worried that the leak of the Pentagon report will "get the
international community upset."</TE>
<TE>   "We should not get all carried away with some sense that the United
States is planning to use nuclear weapons in some contingency that is
coming up in the near future," he said. "It is not the case."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Rice said the report's big news is that Russia is no longer
considered an enemy. "This is a report that recognizes that, thanks to
our new strategic relationship with Russia, the likelihood of nuclear war
with Russia is less likely now than at any time and that we can indeed
reduce our nuclear forces by two-thirds and intend to do that whether
Russia does or not."</TE>
<TE>   Two U.S. senators on the Armed Services Committee confirmed that
military planners are thinking more broadly about possible use of nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Originally, much of our nuclear policy was predicated on nuclear
versus nuclear," said Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), referring to the Cold
War era, when the U.S. squared off with the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, with the advent of these other weapons of mass destruction, the
purpose of the report was to think through our policy, given the growing
number of types of weapons of mass destruction," said Warner, the senior
Republican on the Armed Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing with him on CNN, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said the
leak of the Pentagon planning report might serve as a warning to
potential adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I don't mind some of these renegade nations who we have
reason to believe are working themselves to develop nuclear weapons--and
I'm thinking of Iraq and Iran and North Korea here--to think twice about
the willingness of the United States to take action to defend our people
and our values and our allies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials made clear that the term "weapons of mass
destruction" referred not just to nuclear bombs but also to chemical and
biological weapons. Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, included "high explosives" in his definition of
the term.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon report "simply states our deterrence posture, of which
nuclear weapons are a part," Myers said on CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf
Blitzer."</TE>
<TE>   "This preserves for the president all the options that a president
would want to have in case this country or our friends and allies were
attacked with weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, biological,
chemical or, for that matter, high explosives," Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about deterrence," he added. "We certainly hope to deter
other actors in this world from taking steps with weapons of mass
destruction that could have devastating effects on our population and the
population of our friends and our allies."</TE>
<TE>   The classified report, called the Nuclear Posture Review, was prepared
after the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon. It was sent to
Congress on Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The report marks the first time an official list of potential targets
has been revealed. It describes a series of scenarios that could call for
U.S. use of nuclear weapons, including a Chinese attack on Taiwan, a
North Korean attack on South Korea or an Iraqi attack on Israel or its
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   News of the Pentagon's planning was met with amazement and anger in
foreign capitals, according to news reports.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitry Rogozin, a leading Russian lawmaker, said the U.S. report was
intended to intimidate Moscow. "They've brought out a big stick, a
nuclear stick that is supposed to scare us and put us in our place,"
Rogozin said in a TV interview.</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, Libyan official Ali Abd Al-Salam al-Turiki said he found it
hard to believe the U.S. was contemplating using nuclear weapons. "I
don't think this is true," he said. "I don't think America is going to
destroy the world."</TE>

<DH>Security: Women report being groped. Others fume over seemingly
nonsensical decisions.</DH>

<LD>The Horrigan family was about to board the flight back to
Pittsburgh from Walt Disney World when the gate agent scrutinizing their
boarding passes stopped them.</LD>
<LD>   "Caroline is going to have to step aside for a manual scan," he told
Courtney and Frank Horrigan. Caroline is their 3-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   "I honestly thought when he figured out that Caroline was the child,
he would ask to search me or my husband," said Courtney Horrigan. Wrong.
So she told her daughter it was time to play a game of "Simon says" with
the airline man.</LD>
<TE>   From Orlando, Fla., to Phoenix to Philadelphia, such incidents are
prompting travelers to wonder whether aviation security is in danger of
running amok and turning on ordinary citizens. Whether the problems stem
from overzealousness or bureaucratic ineptitude, making the system more
user-friendly has become a concern second only to stopping terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   At the Transportation Department, officials worry that horror stories
of passenger harassment will create a political backlash, and they are
hiring a high-level ombudsman at the new Transportation Security
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Even experts who believe the government is doing as well as can be
expected say officials have failed to spell out passengers'
responsibilities and rights. Another gap is a lack of clear protocols for
dealing with minor incidents. Without such guidelines, even a sarcastic
comment from a frustrated traveler can escalate into a federal felony
charge.</TE>
<TE>   The file of complaints such as the Horrigans' is growing.</TE>
<TE>   An 86-year-old World War II fighter ace was repeatedly searched at the
Phoenix airport last month after screeners discovered a suspicious
article in his jacket: his star-shaped Medal of Honor. "The way the
[security] guy had it in his hand, it was like you could scratch somebody
with it," said retired Marine Corps Gen. Joe Foss. "I'm not some punk
sitting on a hill looking for trouble. They are swatting at gnats and
letting the big bees in." Foss was traveling to West Point to speak to
the sophomore class and wanted to show the cadets his medal.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of women have complained of being groped or subjected to
demeaning sexual remarks by male security screeners at airports around
the country. Cathleen Reinke of Chicago said she was given a "rubdown" by
a male screener at the Philadelphia airport Jan. 16, even though she
didn't set off the metal detector. "It's like they're taking advantage of
their power, thinking that people are not going to complain. I really
didn't know what my rights were--all I knew is that it was extremely
uncomfortable." Philadelphia police are investigating.</TE>
<TE>   One sign of the system's problems is that similar infractions have met
with radically different responses.</TE>
<TE>   Raho Ortiz was detained by air marshals in November after he broke a
rule against leaving his seat during the last 30 minutes of a flight to
Washington's Reagan National. Officials declined to file federal charges.</TE>
<TE>   In Salt Lake City, businessman Richard Bizzaro faces up to 20 years in
prison if convicted of interfering with a flight crew during the Winter
Olympics. Bizzaro went to the lavatory 25 minutes before his plane landed
and claims he did not hear instructions to remain seated. A federal
complaint said he "stared intently" at a flight attendant who challenged
him. "Mr. Bizzaro is not a criminal," said Max Wheeler, his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is a lot of wasted energy," said Barry Steinhardt,
associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union. "It's hard to
justify what the purported security benefit is. We certainly should not
be giving up our rights for the illusion of security."</TE>
<TE>   Others say the problems are mostly signs of the stress commercial
aviation faces as long as more attacks are a possibility and the new
security system remains a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to defend groping or some other things that people are
doing, but if you assume there is a war going on and the airports are the
front line, then maybe we've got to accept some of this," said MIT
management professor Arnold Barnett. "Look at the incredible ruthlessness
of the people who have brought us to where we are." Barnett has been a
consultant to the Federal Aviation Administration on safety and security
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Transportation Department officials said they are keenly aware
that efficiency and customer service are keys to their ultimate success.</TE>
<TE>   One official said Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta "went
through the roof" when the first complaints of sexual harassment by
screeners reached his desk. Arizona Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano notified
Mineta that she is investigating at least 28 complaints of improper
searches. Screeners have been told that sexual harassment is a firing
offense; they also may be prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>'Trusted Traveler' Program Urged</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the process of making a transition," said another official,
who spoke on the condition that he not be named. "We are not going to
have everybody making perfect decisions all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Department spokesman Lenny Alcivar said the anecdotes from around the
country "are not reflective of a widespread problem." Things should
improve dramatically, he said, especially since the government now has
direct control of security checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   But the extent of the problem is unknown. There is no clear channel
for consumers to report complaints. The department's Aviation Consumer
Protection Division investigates complaints of poor service and
discrimination, but it is unclear whether the obscure office will also
handle security problems. Consumers can send e-mail to
airconsumer@ost.dot.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers say they support strong security, but at the same time they
can't figure out how the measures applied to them are making travel any
safer.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Horrigan said random searches of 3-year-olds like his daughter
Caroline divert resources from real security risks. "There was no
acknowledgment that this was a silly exercise," Horrigan said of the Feb.
11 incident in Orlando. "My wife did ask the agent if he realized
[Caroline] was 3, and he said he'd done several 3-year-olds that day."</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Horrigan said she did not feel the incident merited filing a
complaint. But a certain chill creeps into her voice when she tells the
story.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel it is a symbol of what things are now going to be like in
airports, and for our children growing up," she said. "My daughter is
learning at an early age about what life will be like in a new world."</TE>
<TE>   Experiences such as the Horrigans' illustrate the importance of
creating a "trusted traveler" program, advocates say. Passengers who
agree to a background check would receive a special card that would speed
their check-in and exempt them from random searches.</TE>
<TE>   "We will wallow in mediocrity if we apply the same security measures
to all passengers," said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel
Coalition. "There's got to be a triage approach."</TE>
<TE>   Security officials are evaluating the idea, but they worry that
terrorists could infiltrate such a program.</TE>
<TE>   The Horrigans followed the rules and experienced only momentary
awkwardness. But those who breach security--even if they lack
malice--risk having the full weight of the federal government come down
on them. Robert Hedrick of Delaware, Ohio, admits to using poor judgment.
But he's facing federal felony charges.</TE>
<TE>   Hedrick is accused of knowingly carrying a concealed weapon on an
aircraft--a belt buckle that doubles as a small, single-blade utility
knife. The tech support engineer uses the knife as a work tool. Hedrick
would have avoided trouble on his Jan. 23 flight if he hadn't called a
radio talk show to report that he was on a plane with a knife. The
airport metal detector had failed to pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   "People recognize universally that it was a dumb decision to call a
radio station," said Kort Gatterdam, Hedrick's lawyer. "He regrets this
incident, but he certainly had no criminal intent. I have no doubt in my
mind this case would not be there but for Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>Aviation Security Laws Said to Need Refining</TE>
<TE>   Gatterdam said his client called the talk show to ask for advice on
what to do, but the government believes he was trying to get attention.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say it's time to refine aviation security laws to
distinguish between bad judgment--even boorish behavior--and nefarious
purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you have a guy who ends up having a disagreement with a flight
attendant, and all of a sudden you get him for interfering with a flight
crew," said aviation consultant Douglas Laird, a former Secret Service
agent and airline security director.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people who are jerks have been overreacted against by people who
didn't have power before and all of a sudden have a lot of power," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that Foss, the World War II hero who ran into trouble for
carrying his medal at the Phoenix airport, also had a small novelty
knife.</TE>
<TE>   It was part of his money clip, a memento from the Congressional Medal
of Honor Society. He put the clip--along with a silver bullet key chain
given to him by Charlton Heston--in an envelope and paid to have it
mailed back to his home.</TE>
<TE>   But he would not part with his medal. Security relented and Foss was
allowed to board with it. "Nobody takes that medal," Foss said. It was
presented to him in the Oval Office by President Franklin D. Roosevelt
after Foss shot down 26 enemy planes in the Pacific theater--23 in 10
days of combat over Guadalcanal.</TE>
<TE>   The Medal of Honor is on a ribbon. "I suppose you could swing it
around like a slingshot," Foss said. "If some terrorist came at me with
something like that, I'd knock him so hard he'd go through the side of
the airplane."</TE>

<HD>Taliban Had the Blues, Says an Afghan Doctor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>They strutted around in black turbans, they drove big pickups, they
looked tough. But on the inside, the Taliban were actually a bunch of
pretty depressed guys.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's what their shrink says.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember one Taliban commander telling me he hadn't seen a sunny
day his whole life," said Dr. Nader Alemi, director of mental health at
Mazar-i-Sharif's General Hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Another commander, Alemi recalled, wanted to commit suicide but
couldn't because of Islamic strictures. "Every time he went to
battle--and this was a big general--he hoped someone would shoot him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Taliban needed more guns," the doctor added with a
grin. "But more Prozac."</TE>
<TE>   When the hard-line Islamic Taliban invaded this northern Afghan city 3
1/2 years ago, Alemi was stuck in the unenviable position of dispensing
mental health care to a group of people who, with their appetite for war
and medieval punishments, would seem certifiably insane almost anywhere
else.</TE>
<TE>   His Taliban patients are gone now. But Alemi, who deposits a soft
touch and a gigantic "Ho-bas!" (Good!) on each person he meets, is still
very, very busy. Every day, there's a line 50 patients long outside his
office: children traumatized by bomb blasts, soldiers who were tortured,
schizophrenic shopkeepers, sleepless farmers worried about drought,
sleepless girls worried about marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Taliban life is a little freer, a little brighter, though still
unsettled. Alemi's practice offers a glimpse, however random or rushed,
of how Afghan society is adjusting.</TE>
<TE>   "Doctor, I can't remember any verses from the Koran, and my mullah
says I'm crazy," began Mohammed Tahir, a distressed student, during a
recent office visit.</TE>
<TE>   "You seem as wise as the prophet," Alemi said, patting the young man
on the head. "Don't worry so much. You'll remember everything."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Alemi's soothing optimism, mental health care here is in a
sorry state. For a population of 25 million, Afghanistan has perhaps two
dozen psychiatrists. The only psychiatric hospital is a 50-bed facility
in the capital, Kabul, and it is shut down half the time. In Mazar, Alemi
works from a corner of the hopelessly crowded General Hospital and in a
small private clinic above a vegetable shop.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan has no practicing psychologists, social workers or
counselors, said Dr. Azizullah Baig, one of Alemi's few colleagues. Most
aid agencies are still in emergency mode, focusing on first aid, child
immunizations and nutrition.</TE>
<TE>Modernity vs. Tradition</TE>
<TE>   "We feed people first," said Dr. Abdul Wahid Wahidi, a Mazar-based
program officer for the World Health Organization. "Then we worry if they
are happy."</TE>
<TE>   Extended families and mosques provide some support for the mentally
ill. But they can also muddy things up.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, Alemi's red-carpeted office, with its bare white walls
and empty light sockets, became a boxing ring where modernity and
tradition duked it out.</TE>
<TE>   In one corner was a desk cluttered with price lists for modern
psychotropic medications--Zoloft, Paxil, Lithonate, Prozac--or, more
specifically, the Iranian-made generic equivalents available here.</TE>
<TE>   In another corner lay a 25-year-old woman convinced that her in-laws
had cursed her with a supernatural intruder--a jinni.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, life does not interest me," said the woman, named
Feriba. "I don't even wash my husband's clothes anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother had already taken her to see a mullah.</TE>
<TE>   "Should we sacrifice another goat?" Feriba asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Ney. Ney," Alemi said. No. No. "Allah has given these pills great
power. It's like swallowing a little piece of god."</TE>
<TE>   After she shuffled off, he said, "They usually trust the doctor."</TE>
<TE>A Practical Approach</TE>
<TE>   Alemi's work is no Freudian analysis. With five to six patients an
hour, many of whom have journeyed for days to see him, there's no time to
sit alongside a couch and download an entire life story.</TE>
<TE>   Often, he dispenses practical health advice.</TE>
<TE>   To a farmer with insomnia and high blood pressure: "Eat less fat and
nuts."</TE>
<TE>   To a nibbled-fingered woman depressed about miscarriages: "Your baby
will come, God willing. But you must rest more."</TE>
<TE>   During the Taliban days, Alemi, 46, was careful to refer to many
ailments as "nervous problems," not as mental or emotional ones.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were warriors," he said. "They couldn't be marked as mad."</TE>
<TE>   Because Alemi grew up in the northeastern city of Jalalabad and is the
only psychiatrist in northern Afghanistan to speak Pashto, the language
of most Talibs, he became their doctor after they captured Mazar in
August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban forces used the city of 200,000 as a base for military
operations across the north, and Alemi, an ethnic Tajik, estimates he
treated at least 1,000 soldiers and commanders of the regime.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when they'd cry, I'd cry, and when they'd feel down, I'd
feel down," he remembered. "One soldier once told me: 'This is great.
Finally I meet a doctor who suffers from the same thing I do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Alemi has a simple diagnosis for the Taliban: They were sick of war.
Most wanted to go home and see their families, except a few leaders who
really were quite ill.</TE>
<TE>   One night, a few weeks before Mazar fell last November, Alemi was
whisked from his house to see Aktar Osmani, the most powerful Taliban
commander in Mazar and a confidant of Mullah Mohammed Omar, the group's
spiritual leader.</TE>
<TE>   "The commander was hearing voices," Alemi said. "He was schizo."</TE>
<TE>   Alemi scribbled out a prescription for haloperidol, an antipsychotic
medication that the man would be able to obtain, and left.</TE>
<TE>   "I would treat anybody who was sick," Alemi said. "But I was not
neutral. These people caused a lot of pain in our society."</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, there are many jokes about the Taliban, which Alemi
encourages.</TE>
<TE>   Outside his office, a young man nudged through the crowd, saying,
"Excuse me, excuse me, I must see Mullah Omar," which means "go to the
bathroom."</TE>
<TE>   Things in Afghanistan are easing up, and once again Alemi has time to
go cake shopping in his rusty Nissan, grow roses on his front lawn and
research the next topic for his weekly 15-minute "Health for All" radio
show.</TE>
<TE>   He has a great reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much empathy in that man's blood," said Rafat Fugaha, a
psychiatrist visiting from Jordan. Alemi got his M.D. from the Kabul
Faculty of Medicine, completed a three-month fellowship in Poland and
learned English from Mr. Chris, a Peace Corps volunteer. It's come in
handy because he keeps his notes of psychiatric sessions in English,
which protects patient confidentiality since nobody in his office can
decipher them.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Perween, illegally ran a girls school during the
Taliban era. But the Taliban left him alone, because so many of its
members were his patients.</TE>
<TE>   He makes $30 a month. Short and thick, he suffers from diabetes.
Sometimes all the gunmen on the street frighten him.</TE>
<TE>   But at the end of a recent workday, with the last bits of sun glinting
off his gold-rimmed glasses, Alemi's cheerfulness hadn't slackened.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to see the world and have many nice things," he said.
"But Allah put me here in Afghanistan to work. And I am satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   Then he caught himself with a laugh: "Or maybe I'm just--how do you
say in your language?--rationalizing."</TE>

<HD>School Board Poised to Revive Abandoned Belmont Project</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: Turnaround is credited to Supt. Roy Romer's political
skills and rising Latino power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the first things Roy Romer did after he became
superintendent of the Los Angeles schools nearly two years ago was walk
around the shuttered Belmont Learning Complex.</LD>
<LD>   The half-finished high school next to downtown loomed over the Harbor
Freeway like a gigantic billboard advertising the Los Angeles Unified
School District's incompetence in starting such a huge project on a
polluted site and then stopping it after spending $154 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Education had killed the project before Romer's arrival
amid fears about the health hazards of toxic gases beneath the former oil
field and allegations of mismanagement.</LD>
<TE>   But as Romer paced through the waist-high weeds and empty halls, he
envisioned the day when Belmont would be resurrected.</TE>
<TE>   And that day appears to be at hand Tuesday, when a majority of the
board seems likely to approve a plan by a group of Latino activists and
school builders to finish the campus--a proposal that could cost another
$87 million.</TE>
<TE>   That turnaround, observers say, is a result of Romer's political
skills, the election of several new school board members, rising Latino
power, the faded fortunes of the project's critics in Sacramento and a
second look at the environmental solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "Building Belmont will save LAUSD," said Fernando Guerra, director of
the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University.
"It will lead to more schools being built, to the school district not
being broken up. It's that important."</TE>
<TE>   Romer needs four votes on the seven-member Board of Education to
finish the school, which would serve 4,600 students in one of the
district's most crowded corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Caprice Young and members Jose Huizar and Mike Lansing
said they will vote to enter negotiations with the Alliance for a Better
Community to complete Belmont. Marlene Canter and David Tokofsky said
they are leaning in the same direction. But Julie Korenstein and Genethia
Hudley Hayes oppose the plan, saying they are still concerned about
environmental hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to give Romer credit for finding a way to take a politically
toxic issue and bringing it to what looks like a good conclusion," said
Bill Ouchi, a UCLA business professor involved in local school reform.</TE>
<TE>   To its supporters, finishing Belmont is about more than providing new
classrooms and getting downtown students off buses. The district's very
credibility is on the line.</TE>
<TE>   For these proponents, Belmont is about keeping a promise of a new
school to mainly Latino families who felt betrayed after the district
abandoned the campus in January 2000, midway through construction and, in
addition to the $154 million in building costs, spent $20 million more on
attorneys, litigation and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Belmont has become a rallying point for a broad cross-section of
Latino power brokers and its completion a litmus test of their growing
influence in civic life.</TE>
<TE>   For the district, the school is about regaining the confidence of
Sacramento lawmakers, who hold the district's purse strings, and ending a
national embarrassment. And, observers say, it's also about reclaiming
public trust as L.A. Unified prepares to ask Los Angeles voters to
approve more than $1 billion in new school construction bonds in
November.</TE>
<TE>   "To complete it now would signal that this is a new school board, a
new superintendent and a new democratic process in which what the
community wants is what the community gets," said Robert Garcia, a civil
rights attorney who heads a citizens committee overseeing the district's
previous $2.4-billion school construction and repair bond.</TE>
<TE>   Belmont seemed doomed when Romer arrived. The school had become
entangled in lawsuits and investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The district's inspector general criticized its staff for starting
construction without adequate environmental review. The district last
year lost an arbitrated judgment in a contract dispute over $17 million
owed the previous developer, architects and others.</TE>
<TE>   The district even took its own outside lawyers to court for allegedly
not protecting its interests on Belmont, but in January lost that
malpractice suit. The district attorney's office, meanwhile, is
conducting a probe into, among other things, whether the pollution's
extent was properly studied before construction.</TE>
<TE>   During his first days on the job, Romer decided that Belmont would be
key to rehabilitating the image of a school system that, he says,
"couldn't shoot straight."</TE>
<TE>   It irked him to see the abandoned campus, boarded up and wrapped in
plastic sheathing.</TE>
<TE>   Romer still winces when recalling a meeting at a banker's high-rise
office that overlooked the property. "We went to the window and he said,
'There's your school,' " Romer recalled. So the former Colorado governor
began a determined campaign to finish it.</TE>
<TE>   Romer lobbied reluctant school board members, some newly elected, to
seek bids from outside developers. When board members hedged, Romer
agreed to a compromise, adding an option to sell the 34-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   But Romer acknowledges that he viewed the compromise as more a
political necessity than a realistic goal. "I wanted to build [the
school]," he said. "I just [didn't] see selling it as a good option."</TE>
<TE>   The board voted 4 to 3 in December 2000 to seek outside bids, and
Romer began pitching Belmont to anyone who would listen. He buttonholed
reluctant construction executives at cocktail parties. He kept hawking
the notorious project despite Belmont's bad press.</TE>
<TE>   Several construction teams later came to a bidders conference at the
district's downtown headquarters. Romer took the microphone and made an
emotional plea to a room of skeptical executives.</TE>
<TE>   "He sort of implored the private sector to come forward to help the
district," said Charles Robinson, a vice president at Levine-Frickie, an
environmental engineering firm that was one of the unsuccessful bidders.
"He made me feel, 'Here's a guy we need to work with because they're
desperate.' "</TE>
<TE>   Three teams ultimately submitted bids to complete Belmont. To help
legitimize the process, Romer hired an outside panel of construction,
engineering and insurance experts to evaluate the competing proposals. In
a boost for Romer, the committee concluded that the school could be made
safe and should be built.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the bidding process, Romer disqualified one bidder,
Eastridge Cos., after concluding that the firm had access to inside
information on Belmont. Romer said he wanted to contain the controversy
before it tainted the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   The company has since been cleared, but Romer said another undisclosed
problem kept it out of the running. He would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The expert panel recommended the Alliance for a Better Community, a
coalition of leading Latino activists and business executives. The
alliance includes the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund
and the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission is not to make money on this project," said Ed Avila,
president of the nonprofit ABC group and former head of the Los Angeles
Community Redevelopment Agency. "We really aren't in the development
business, we are in the school construction advocacy business. We have to
get those seats."</TE>
<TE>   The ABC group wants to run Belmont as a charter school. But, in what
could have been another obstacle to the completion project, the teachers
union raised questions about the effectiveness of the proposed charter
operator, Edison Schools.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, at Romer's urging, any discussion about whether it
should be a charter school or regular campus has been put on hold
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's advocacy group sought out construction and engineering
companies when many firms were reluctant to sign on to the
scandal-plagued project. The alliance formed a team that included as its
general contractor the large Southland firm Matt Construction, which had
built the Crystal Cathedral, Bonaventure Hotel and several schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that this would be a unique kind of deal--in my entire
experience I have never seen anything like what we did," Avila said. "But
we just wanted to make sure that there would be at least one first-class
bid and no one could say that there weren't any capable companies to
complete the school."</TE>
<TE>   Romer said ABC was the most qualified bidder, noting that Matt
Construction has a proven track record of building schools. But critics
have questioned whether the ABC team had a leg up from the beginning
because of its strong ties to the Latino community and its relationship
with billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad, a confidant of Romer.</TE>
<TE>   The other eligible bidder, Komex H20 of Westminster, has alleged that
the ABC group has an inferior environmental plan and was chosen for
political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   ABC officials drummed up support by holding meetings with parents at
public schools in the downtown area. And Broad provided $16,000 in seed
money for the group. Perhaps more important, Broad lent moral support and
advice.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them you have to prove that the property can be remediated and
monitored, and you have to indemnify the district against liability,"
Broad said.</TE>
<TE>   Broad sits on the board of directors of a giant insurance company, AIG
International, which was the major insurer on all three bids.</TE>
<TE>   Some school board members still have concerns about soaring costs.
Finishing the job will cost as much as $87 million and be funded by bonds
or fees from private construction projects throughout the district's
territory. Board members also worry about liability and hazards from
methane and hydrogen sulfide gases beneath the school.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC group would install a piping system throughout the site to
vent and treat the gases. A sheer polyethylene liner also would be
installed underground to serve as a barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are still serious environmental problems with the
site," said school board member Hayes. "There are too many open questions
to say I'm comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike two years ago, Belmont faces virtually no outside opposition.
The project's two chief critics in Sacramento--former Assemblyman Scott
Wildman and former state Sen. Tom Hayden--have left office because of
term limits. Hayden declined to comment about Tuesday's school board
vote; Wildman did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Many other public officials are eagerly showing support. The Los
Angeles City Council last week voted unanimously to endorse the revival
plan going before the school board. The Proposition BB Citizens Oversight
Committee also has recommended that Belmont be finished.</TE>
<TE>   Romer sees Tuesday's vote as the culmination of a "political
marathon." But even if the school board rejects the ABC plan, Romer said
he will return until he breaks the finish line. "I'll go back on the next
Tuesday," he said.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Weary and sunburned but proud, 400 American soldiers who fought
tenacious battles with Al Qaeda and Taliban troops in eastern Afghanistan
returned here Sunday, some of them telling bitter stories of being let
down by an Afghan commander.</LD>
<LD>   The troops represent about a third of the U.S. force sent to battle
Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts in the mountainous Shahi Kot region in a
campaign dubbed Operation Anaconda. But senior Bush administration
officials gave conflicting accounts Sunday of whether the pullout meant
the battle was winding down.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Bryan Hilferty, a spokesman for the Army's 10th Mountain Division
here, told reporters, "The major fighting of the battle is over."</LD>
<TE>   But Army Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan,
disputed the notion that the fight in rugged terrain south of Gardez,
which began March 2, was subsiding. He said that it was evolving and that
troops were being repositioned within the battlefield or on its
perimeter. In some cases, he said, fresh troops were rotating in.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm satisfied with our progress up to this point," Franks said on
ABC's "This Week." "And we'll continue to work our way through this area
until we are satisfied that we have taken out all" of the enemy forces.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the U.S. forces had found no sign of either Osama bin
Laden or other Al Qaeda leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said on CNN's "Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer" that the soldiers who
returned to Bagram would "rearm and refit" and return to the battlefield.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on CBS' "Face the Nation" that
troops were "mopping up."</TE>
<TE>   In Gardez, the capital of Paktia province, about 25 miles north of the
fighting, U.S. bombers and helicopters could be seen flying Sunday, and
the heavy concussion of bombs targeting enemy positions could be heard as
night fell.</TE>
<TE>   Safi Ullah, a spokesman for the city's council, said Sunday night that
local Afghan forces were still getting ready to join the United States in
a few days in a renewed ground assault against the Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters who have taken shelter in an extensive cave complex.</TE>
<TE>   But there were also growing signs of tension in Gardez over the
presence of 1,000 troops from the north, under the command of Gen. Gul
Hydar, who had arrived Saturday after having been sent from Kabul by the
central government.</TE>
<TE>   Among the soldiers returning to the base in Bagram, there was pride at
what U.S. and allied forces had accomplished since the first day of the
battle, when the operation, named for a snake that encircles and then
constricts its prey, was surprised by the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty said U.S.-led coalition troops were in control of the Shahi
Kot valley, which was taken during the only concerted ground warfare by
U.S. troops. That fighting cost the lives of eight Americans and left at
least 13 wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was an Al Qaeda guy, I would not go out for a pizza," Hilferty
said. Still, he said, pockets of resistance remained.</TE>
<TE>   The troops had gone into battle with a mission to form "blocking
positions" in the valley, a military term for preventing the enemy's
escape. Theirs was an opening move in Anaconda, an operation encompassing
an area of 60 to 70 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   Allied Afghan troops, commanded by Gen. Zia Lodin, were supposed to
have led their forces, including tanks, into the southern end of the
narrow Shahi Kot valley to flush Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters from their
strongholds toward the U.S. forces, but the Afghans came under fire and
never made it to their position, the soldiers said.</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty and the other soldiers interviewed in Bagram said Lodin's
failure to arrive with his forces left U.S. troops the targets of
withering mortar and gunfire from the south, where Lodin should have
been.</TE>
<TE>   Several returning soldiers heaped derision on Lodin and painted a
picture of a well-prepared opposition that made ample use of advanced
weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   "He punked out on us," said a sergeant from the 10th Mountain
Division, based in Fort Drum, N.Y., who identified himself only as Shawn.
"I don't know how much we paid him, but I'll shoot him myself. He was
supposed to roll in. Day 1 he was supposed to attack, and we were
supposed to set up blocking positions so they couldn't get out."</TE>
<TE>   Another member of the 10th Mountain Division, who identified himself
as Shannon, said Lodin "didn't perform. He took a couple of mortar rounds
and took off."</TE>
<TE>   But a Special Forces officer, who identified himself only at Lt. Col.
Mark, defended Lodin's role, saying he had an "insufficient force ratio"
but recovered from a serious mortar attack to take several key positions
on the second day of battle and again, about four days later. Lodin now
is helping block key roads, he added.</TE>
<TE>Afghans No Less Brave</TE>
<TE>   "The forces [Afghans] put together are different from our American
military force. They're not an American military force. We can't expect
them to be," he said. "It makes them no less noble, no less brave, no
less willing to get out and engage our common enemy, and Gen. Zia has,
make no mistake about it. I take exception to those folks who complain
about what these people have done to get us to this point in the
battlefield. You wear his shoes that he has worn for five months in this
battlefield."</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant colonel estimated remaining Al Qaeda forces at "between
100 to 200 left in the valley." He added that "we are not approaching the
most dangerous part [of the war]. We're in it."</TE>
<TE>   In two villages that had been held by Al Qaeda forces, U.S. troops
found night-vision goggles identical to the ones used by U.S. troops,
Shawn said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a helluva lot more fancy than people give them credit for,"
he said. "There were lots of weapons, mortar tubes. These guys were good
with mortars."</TE>
<TE>   In the first days of the battle, mortars rained down from elevations
of about 9,500 feet, about 1,000 feet above U.S. troops, and appeared to
be carefully aimed, also suggesting that Al Qaeda forces were well
prepared for the offensive.</TE>
<TE>   The 187th Infantry Regiment, part of the 101st Airborne Division, was
forced into a "hasty defense" position from its original task of blocking
the northern end of the valley, according to Lt. Shane Owens, 25, a
platoon leader from Antwerp, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The 187th, based at Ft. Campbell, Ky., had two battalions in the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "They were definitely good shooters," Jacob Lopez, a 21-year-old
specialist, said of the Al Qaeda fighters. Lopez said he is with Charlie
Company of the 1st Battalion of the 187th Infantry Regiment.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew how to send in the mortar rounds," Lopez said. "They can
bracket their rounds real quick."</TE>
<TE>   First Lt. Charles Thompson, of the 10th Mountain Division, said his
troops had secured a small Al Qaeda compound before a platoon-sized force
attacked them from the south--the direction from which Lodin was supposed
to have been moving.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's men repelled the assault with mortar fire, and airstrikes
apparently inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers. After that, a
much-reduced Al Qaeda force came up the valley "in twos or threes," or
fired sniper shots, but never mounted a serious threat to U.S. troops
positioned on ridges on the eastern and western sides of the valley.</TE>
<TE>   "They kind of hit us by surprise at first, south of the compound, and
moved up," Thompson said. "But aircraft blew up about a platoon-sized
element."</TE>
<TE>Ethnic Tensions Mount</TE>
<TE>   In Gardez, the tensions among the Afghan troops working with U.S.
forces and local Afghans continued to simmer Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Hydar's troops are largely ethnic Tajiks from the far north of
Afghanistan, and some ethnic Pushtuns in Gardez see their presence as a
sign that Tajiks will try to take revenge on Pushtuns for the excesses
committed by the Pushtun-dominated Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a local Pushtun commander, Mohammed Ismail, told reporters
that Hydar's troops should go back to Kabul, the capital, because
Paktia's local forces could take care of Al Qaeda on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters earlier, both Hydar and council spokesman Safi
Ullah were dismissive of such concerns, saying that both forces were on
the same side and had the same goal: to eliminate terrorism from
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   And Lt. Col. Mark said that the vast majority of new forces were
Pushtun and that commanders had dropped rivalries for the larger goal of
eliminating the last of the Taliban and Al Qaeda pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Hydar received a delegation of chieftains from the town of Zormat on
Sunday who asked him to pursue a peaceful surrender of the Taliban
fighters in the mountains before launching any attacks. The meeting was
significant because Zormat is the hometown of the commander believed to
be leading the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, Mullah Saifur Rahman Mansour,
and the town is considered sympathetic to them.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. forces have been leery of protracted surrender negotiations
because, in the past, the time has been used by Al Qaeda fighters to slip
away from coalition forces.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEIRTON, W.Va.
</DL>
<LD>In a town that measures its survival one tin can at a time,
President Bush and his plan to protect the steel industry are worth about
a penny.</LD>
<LD>   A penny more for each of the billions of cans made from Weirton steel
might be enough to keep blast-furnace electrician Phil DiMatteis from
getting another layoff notice. It might keep customers coming to Dewey
Guida's BBQ rib restaurant, where $18.95 buys a full rack with a side of
potato skins smothered in cheese sauce. It might even help Weirton Steel
Corp. Chief Executive John Walker pull off a rarity in his beleaguered
industry, a voluntary restructuring outside of Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<LD>   "Our hope is to be one of the last ones standing," Walker said.</LD>
<TE>   With its soot-stained buildings and smoky-gray skies, Weirton is the
gritty incarnation of the political and economic upheaval that prompted a
Republican president who preaches trade liberalization to practice
protectionism. It's a company town that feels betrayed by its traditional
Democratic allies in Washington, a union stronghold that feels victimized
by what many see as a vicious form of predatory commerce masquerading as
free trade.</TE>
<TE>   The past may be painful, the future dicey. But right now, with Bush's
tariffs of up to 30% set to take effect at the stroke of midnight March
20, it feels like springtime in the Upper Ohio Valley. Every year,
Americans buy about 32 billion cans of green beans, sliced peaches,
stewed tomatoes and other grocery staples. Every fourth can is made from
tin plate that was cast, milled, plated and rolled at the sprawling
Weirton Steel plant that towers over everything else in town.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts say Bush's tariffs might cause steel prices to rise
10% as foreign steelmakers abandon the U.S. market or try to recover the
import duties by charging more for their products. The White House says
the tariffs are intended to counteract "dumping," the practice of selling
steel in the U.S. at below-market rates.</TE>
<TE>   The duties could push a can of Campbell's chicken noodle soup, which
contains about 9 cents' worth of steel, from 79 cents to 80 cents at the
local Kroger. Weirton Steel's revenue, about $1 billion last year, might
go up $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is ecstatic at the prospect. Bush's rescue plan will not
only inflate the cost of consumer products. Economists say the number of
jobs saved in mill towns such as Weirton will be exceeded by the number
lost in industries that use steel to make autos, appliances and other
durable goods. The tariffs could prompt other countries to retaliate, and
a trade war is the last thing the world needs as it tries to recover from
recession.</TE>
<TE>   But for Weirton and its 23,000 inhabitants, it's a chance to make a
fresh start. For George W. Bush, it's an opportunity to make further
inroads in a region that has long been allergic to Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what this is about. We finally have a president with
the guts to enforce the law," said Darrell Curtis, who went to work at
the mill straight out of high school in 1972 and has been there ever
since, except the year he was laid off in the early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis, 48, remembers well that day in July 1992, when Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton and running mate Al Gore showed up at the community center
wearing flannel shirts and uttering solemn promises that if elected, they
would protect local mill workers from cheap imported steel. Weirton
upheld its end of the bargain at the ballot box. But Clinton, once in
office, declined to initiate the kind of protective action that Bush has
just approved, even after Asian manufacturers, beginning in 1997,
inundated the U.S. market with surplus steel selling at rock-bottom
prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democrats flat out lied to us," Curtis said. "I've never voted
Republican in a presidential election before in my life, but I did this
last time."</TE>
<TE>   So did the rest of West Virginia, for only the fourth time since the
Great Depression. Many here say it's a safe bet the same thing will
happen in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., only about a dozen big companies still are combining ore
and coke in big blast furnaces to produce iron, the raw ingredient of
steel. These "integrated steel" companies are aging behemoths with high
fixed costs, in large part because of the generous pension and health
benefits they are obligated to pay to thousands of retirees.</TE>
<TE>   The integrateds have been hit by a series of shock waves. They lost
business to foreign steelmakers who enjoyed low labor costs and extensive
government support. Their home turf was invaded by newer, more efficient
mini-mills that used electric-hearth furnaces to turn scrap metal into
finished steel. The Asian financial crisis pushed prices to 20-year lows
as foreign steelmakers flooded the U.S. with surpluses made even cheaper
by collapsing currencies.</TE>
<TE>Company Employment a Family Tradition</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four years, 31 American steel companies have entered
bankruptcy proceedings, including seven integrateds: Bethlehem, Geneva,
Gulf States, LTV, National, Republic Technologies, and
Wheeling-Pittsburgh. Entire plants have been shuttered, and industry
employment has fallen to fewer than 150,000 from a peak of 521,000 in the
early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Weirton Steel was founded in 1909 by Ernest Weir, a young entrepreneur
who situated his start-up in Holliday's Cove, an Ohio River village
wedged between Pennsylvania and Ohio in West Virginia's narrow northern
panhandle. The community returned the compliment, changing its name to
Weirton.</TE>
<TE>   For more than six decades, the city and the company thrived, their
fates so intertwined that even those townsfolk who have other jobs say we
and us when talking about the company.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Glyptis graduated from Weirton High School in 1969. Of the 350
people in his class, at least 100 went straight to the mill, landing jobs
that often paid better than the starting salaries received by college
grads.</TE>
<TE>   "You could walk downtown to the company employment office, fill out an
application, go get a physical and start work the following week," said
Glyptis, who went to college and got a marketing degree instead. But he
came back to Weirton and went to work in the steel plant, just like his
father, and his father's father before him. He started in the coke plant
but migrated to the tin mill, where most of the plant's ethnic Greeks
were employed.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Glyptis is president of the Independent Steelworkers Union,
which represents workers at Weirton Steel and nowhere else. He has a seat
on the board of directors, the result of a 1980s crisis resolved when
workers used an employee stock ownership plan to buy the company and
prevent it from being sold to someone else. About 25% of Weirton Steel's
stock still is held by past and present employees, and they have been
allowed to participate in the decision-making process. In recent years,
it hasn't been much fun.</TE>
<TE>   Weirton's work force, which peaked in the early 1960s at 13,500, has
withered away as the company cut back production, shut down some
operations and introduced labor-saving processes and technologies. By the
end of this year, only 3,500 union members will be receiving paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   Glyptis helped CEO Walker draw up the company's restructuring plan. He
has had to sell his members on the need for more job cuts so Weirton
Steel can hold its own against foreign steelmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to stop globalization, I think we're going to have to
concede that," Glyptis said. "As it becomes more difficult to compete
because of global economics, we're going to have to become even more
efficient. Machines, computers will ultimately take the place of people.
If we can maintain the number of employees that we have now, I believe we
will have been highly successful."</TE>
<TE>   The company's recent restructuring has been orchestrated by Walker,
44, who became Weirton Steel's president, CEO and chief operating officer
two years ago. The company had not had a profitable year since 1995 and
was selling steel at prices below the cost of production.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the same bleak circumstances, other integrated companies
entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Walker chose a less conventional strategy:
He asked Weirton Steel's workers, suppliers and creditors to accept job
cuts and debt markdowns that would help the company stay out of court and
get back on its feet much faster. Most of them have signed off already.</TE>
<TE>   An industry shakeout clearly is coming, and Walker aims to be one of
the survivors. That's where the tin cans come in.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the integrated producers, Weirton Steel is the most heavily
concentrated in high-end "tin mill" products, the thin-gauge, plated
sheet metal used to make food cans. Tin plate sells at higher prices,
around $650 a ton, and under long-term contracts is less vulnerable to
price fluctuations. Analysts say Weirton probably can turn a profit on
tin plate at current prices, something that the integrated companies
can't do with commodity products such as hot-rolled steel, which is
selling for about $230 a ton.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bush's plan, all of Weirton's product lines will be protected by
the biggest tariff: 30% the first year, 24% the second and 18% the third.
After three years, the levy would disappear. The government will collect
the tariff as steel enters the country; the effect on prices depends on
how much of the import tax foreign steelmakers are willing to absorb and
how much is passed on to buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, like others here, gets a little prickly when people accuse the
steel industry of using its political clout to get help from the
government at everyone else's expense. Even his 14-year-old daughter,
Jenna, demanded to know why her dad wanted to boost the price of cars and
refrigerators and possibly cause people in steel-consuming industries to
lose their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   He asked her if she would want to buy a car at half the normal price
if she found out the reason it was cheap was that it had been stolen.
That, he said, is what has been going on in the steel market, and Bush's
remedies will help right that wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Walker has some justification for his claim. Two years ago, the U.S.
International Trade Commission ruled that Japanese steelmakers were
selling tin plate in the United States at illegal, below-market prices.
It was one of several successful cases brought by Weirton to fight
dumping.</TE>
<TE>A Future Based on More Than Tin Cans</TE>
<TE>   Phil DiMatteis, the 25-year-old blast-furnace electrician, said he's
not sure what effect the tariff will have on prices, but he hopes it will
buy him a little security. In 1998, he was one of about 1,000 employees
laid off by Weirton Steel. He was called back within a year, but his lack
of seniority means he'll be among the first casualties if further cuts
become necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the help from the president is hopefully enough of a crutch
that the industry, at least Weirton anyway, can get some financial
stability," said DiMatteis, whose father, Tony, retired in 1999 after 33
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to hope that this mill could be here for another 30 years to
be able to provide for my family," DiMatteis said. "But it doesn't have a
history of being very stable."</TE>
<TE>   John Bodonski, who retired from Weirton only a few months ago at the
age of 54, said he knows he will be paying a few pennies more for the
canned goods he buys at the grocery store. But if it restores even a
fraction of the region's old prosperity, it would be money well spent, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, everybody bought brand-new cars every three
years," Bodonski said. "We made money. We kept the economy going. Weirton
Steel and Wheeling Steel, they kept everything moving around here. When
we were doing good, everything was doing good."</TE>
<TE>   Dewey Guida remembers those days too. The owner of Dee Jay's BBQ Ribs
in downtown Weirton, Guida, 58, has watched as the entire region shared
the fate of its principal employer. In recent years, he has become
heavily involved in efforts to diversify the economic base of the Upper
Ohio Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The tariff, he said, "just gives us a little bit of lifeblood," a
chance to build a future based on more than just tin cans.</TE>
<TE>   "Will it save us? No. We'll save ourselves," Guida said. "This is our
day of reckoning now."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Gets Back to Normal</HD>
<DH>It turns out that not everything changed forever on Sept. 11--life
is much the same for many Americans. But not for everyone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was during Sunday school at St. Mark's Lutheran Church that
Janice Vogel finally got angry.</LD>
<LD>   Her husband, Fritz, had been away from their Birdsboro, Pa., home for
months. The Air Force recalled Fritz to active duty Oct. 21 to manage
construction projects at an air base in New Jersey, part of the call-up
in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   That was bad enough. But Fritz Vogel owns his own business, a small
welding firm. When he was called up, he had to close the shop and lay off
his two oldest sons.</LD>
<TE>   So when Janice Vogel, 48, heard one of her neighbors announce her
relief that she felt free to go shopping at the mall again now that life
had "returned to normal," she reddened.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't they understand how this has changed our world completely?" she
asked. "I don't want any sympathy, but I'd like some support for the men
who are out there."</TE>
<TE>   Six months after Sept. 11, here's what's changed:</TE>
<TE>   The federal government, its budget and its public image. The focus of
American foreign policy. Security measures at airports, seaports and
border crossings. The nation's sense of patriotism, cohesion and
vulnerability. The lives of almost 1.4 million people in the armed
services, including more than 78,000 reservists abruptly yanked from
their civilian lives. And, of course, the fates of the victims, their
families and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what hasn't changed much: Everything else.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's economy is recovering at a handsome pace; the terrorist
attacks delayed the rebound only briefly. Politics is back to normal too:
Democrats and Republicans are fighting over taxes and energy policy and
election campaigns as if last fall's brief show of wartime bipartisanship
had never happened.</TE>
<TE>   Americans still say they feel more worried, more patriotic, more
religious and more charitable than before Sept. 11, but they aren't
behaving that way. Their career choices, marriage rates, church
attendance, charitable donations and volunteering have settled back into
pre-crisis patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Only five months after a wave of anthrax-laced letters killed five
people, the mail is back to normal. Americans are even returning to
airline travel: Passenger miles are still lower than a year ago, but the
gap is narrowing.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the war on terrorism changing "everything," as some
predicted, the nation has seen a kind of patchwork mobilization. The
government, the military, the airlines are all still on a wartime
footing. But the rest of the country is largely "back to normal."</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if there are two different worlds," said Robert D. Putnam, a
Harvard University social scientist. "There was, and there still is, a
significant change in the mood of the country. . . . But changes in
behavior--in giving blood or giving money--have been much less marked."</TE>
<TE>   When the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
many likened the attacks to Pearl Harbor. But Pearl Harbor and World War
II transformed American society by drawing more than 16 million men and
women into the armed forces, more than 12% of the population. During the
Vietnam War, 8.7 million served, about 4% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   This war is being fought by a military of 1.4 million, less than
one-half of 1% of the population. (And only about 5,300 of those troops
are in or around Afghanistan.) "Imagine Pearl Harbor if it hadn't been
followed by World War II," said William A. Galston, a University of
Maryland political scientist. "What transformed the World War II
generation wasn't the shock of the [Pearl Harbor] attack but the
comprehensive national mobilization that followed."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we've had the attack but not the mobilization. What is most
dramatic about the six months since Sept. 11 is not how much our lives
have changed but rather how little."</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Perez misses her children.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, 43, loved being a stay-at-home mom in San Sebastian, Puerto
Rico, to 17-year-old Iris and 10-year-old Juan, "my baby."</TE>
<TE>   But three days after Sept. 11, her Army Reserve unit, the 311th
Mortuary Affairs Company, was airlifted to Virginia to recover bodies
from the wreckage of the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "I prayed for strength," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Sgt. Perez is still in Virginia, sorting the
personal effects of the dead. Her husband and children are back home in
Puerto Rico. She has been told her deployment may last a full year, which
could mean she would miss Iris' high school graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said she felt glad to pitch in--and touched that the
victims' families reached out to her unit with cheers and thanks.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't expect anything like that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The shared experience of Sept. 11 did make Americans more worried
about their safety, more concerned about each other and more willing to
support federal spending on defense and other programs--attitudes that
persist today.</TE>
<TE>   A CBS News poll in January found that 65% of the public believed more
terrorist attacks were likely, although only 22% said they feared that
their own areas would be targeted. (Fully 88% said their daily routines
had returned to normal.)</TE>
<TE>   Several polls have found that Americans' trust in the government's
ability to do the right thing has jumped significantly--from 31% to 55%
in the CBS poll, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Support for increased defense spending also soared, including, for the
first time, among a majority of women as well as men.</TE>
<TE>   Characteristically, when Americans were asked if they wanted the
government to spend more on defense, homeland security, education, health
care or energy, a majority said yes to all of the choices without sorting
out priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "People want guns and butter too," said Andrew Kohut, director of the
Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, an independent opinion
research group.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean they consciously want a bigger federal
government. "People don't like government more; they just need government
more," Kohut said.</TE>
<TE>   But Putnam believes there's a chance that trend could have lasting
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth in trust in government is just astonishing," Putnam said.
"If it were to last, I think it could have a major long-run impact on
politics. People would see government as part of the solution, not just
part of the problem."</TE>
<TE>   That increased trust in government came along with an increased
willingness to trust--and work with--others in the community, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Putnam noted, it could all just be a blip on the
graph.</TE>
<TE>   "After almost any crisis, calamity or natural disaster, there's a
sudden spike in community-mindedness, whether it's an earthquake, a flood
or a snowstorm in Buffalo," he said. "But these spikes don't last. Over
time, the community feeling dissipates.</TE>
<TE>   "The only exception I know to that rule is Pearl Harbor. The increase
in community-mindedness among people who went through Pearl Harbor and
World War II still hasn't disappeared. They still vote more, give more,
volunteer more--even though they're getting pretty old now.</TE>
<TE>   "So the question is: Is the movement we saw in community-mindedness
after 9/11 going to be like Pearl Harbor or a Buffalo snowstorm?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know yet. We ought to be talking about how to make this
moment last."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush made "a wonderful start" by proposing to bring more
than 200,000 new volunteers into federal programs for national service,
like the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's not much going on at the local level," Putnam said. "The
odds are that this will be more like a Buffalo snowstorm."</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks affected public opinion in two more ways that
could be important to the nation's politics, at least in the short run.</TE>
<TE>   They appear to have increased Americans' commitment to an assertive
foreign policy. In the Pew poll, 61% said the best way to prevent
terrorism would be to be active in world affairs. An impressive 73%
supported using military force against Iraq--although 53% wanted to have
the support of other allies first.</TE>
<TE>   And the experience of the last six months clearly has changed Bush's
image in the eyes of many. His increased stature could, in turn, improve
the Republicans' chances in congressional races this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11, Bush's approval rating was bumping along the 50% mark.
After Sept. 11, that number soared above 90% and has remained at 75% or
higher, a record run by historical standards.</TE>
<TE>   "That's real," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas). "That suggests that
people have gotten to know George W. Bush and have decided that they like
him. And that goes a long way in politics."</TE>
<TE>   About three weeks after the terrorist attacks, Gramm said, another
senator suggested that politics had probably changed "forever" and that a
new bipartisanship would be the order of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sound like a cynic, but forever is a long time,"
Gramm replied.</TE>
<TE>   "In any case, I think things did change for about three months," he
said. "And that's close to forever in politics."</TE>
<TE>   Laura Murcott, 29, still commutes to work from her North Hollywood
home. But instead of driving to her civilian job as an insurance claims
adjuster in Glendale, she now drives more than 50 miles to Channel
Islands Air National Guard Station in Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Murcott is a navigator on a C-130 transport in the California
Air National Guard. If Marines need an airlift to a homeland security
emergency in the Western United States, her unit may be the one to take
them.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people aren't really aware" that thousands of reservists
have been mobilized. "But I've managed to get past that. If people can
have their normal lives, that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   The real strain is "knowing that we could be alerted for a mission at
any time. That takes its toll."</TE>
<TE>   The effect of Sept. 11 on the nation's economy ought to be easy to
see, but it's not.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, things were painfully clear: stock markets suspended,
airports closed, more than 120,000 airline employees laid off, resorts
and hotels empty and a wide range of other businesses planning for a
deeper recession.</TE>
<TE>   "If ever a situation existed in which the fabric of business and
consumer confidence, both here and abroad, was vulnerable to being torn,
the shock of Sept. 11 was surely it," Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan recently told Congress. "Indeed, for a period of weeks, U.S.
economic activity did drop dramatically in response to that shock."</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of 2001, Greenspan said, "business and consumer
confidence recovered, no doubt buoyed by success in the war on
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "The recuperative powers of the U.S. economy . . . have been
remarkable," he concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Economic statistics released during the last month have brought almost
uniformly good news: manufacturing production up, consumer spending up,
growth estimates up, the stock market up.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean Sept. 11 had no lasting effect.</TE>
<TE>   Many economists believe the great economic boom of the 1990s was
driven principally by two forces: a federal budget that moved from
deficit to surplus, producing historically low interest rates that made
it cheap for businesses to borrow; and increased use of computers and
other technology, which made workers more productive and companies more
efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Now both those forces are in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the federal government will spend more on defense and
homeland security--and run a deficit to do it--means that inflation and
interest rates are likely to be higher than they would otherwise be.
Billions of dollars won't be available for other investments that would
be more productive.</TE>
<TE>   And as for the private sector, the new kinds of "friction"--the
general burden of security measures that slow the flow of goods, people,
information and money--sap potential economic strength.</TE>
<TE>   It takes air travelers hours longer to get through airports--hours
that add up to lost work and lost production. Similarly, the cost of
shipping goods has gone up as FedEx, UPS and others have imposed
surcharges, in part to cover the costs of increased security.</TE>
<TE>   Major corporations say they also are spending more money and time on
security.</TE>
<TE>   The International Security Management Assn., a group of corporate
security managers, polled its members in November and found that 77%
expect to be spending more on domestic security measures this year.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, only 35% of the companies surveyed had plans for
dealing with biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on their facilities.
After Sept. 11, the number more than doubled.</TE>
<TE>   But even there, the effects may not be as dramatic as predicted.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Industry Assn., the trade group for makers of security
systems and devices, held its convention and trade show in Las Vegas last
week, and at least some participants reported that the boom they expected
was more of a boomlet.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone I've talked to--manufacturers, consultants--is reporting
increased business," said David Saddler, a spokesman for the trade group.
"For some it's terrific; for some it's small. But people aren't being
swamped."</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that new
spending on security inside the United States, public and private, could
increase inflation enough to slow the economy's growth by 0.1% a year.
That may not sound like a lot, but it means $10 billion less economic
production in the first year alone.</TE>
<TE>   Love Majors was in his office at Compass Bank in Carrollton, Texas,
near Dallas, when the phone call came: The Air Force ordered him to leave
his job signing up merchants for Visa and MasterCard--and spend a year as
a firefighter at an air base in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife used a few choice four-letter words when I told her," he
said. "I'm taking quite a hit financially."</TE>
<TE>   The worst part, Majors said, is the feeling that the rest of the
country has returned to normal--and forgotten that thousands of
reservists have upended their civilian lives to help defend the country.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning, people were great. Some of the people at the bank
sent me a care package--Hershey's Kisses, peanut butter brittle, a
disposable camera, a phone card," he recalled. "But that was early on.
It's beginning to dissipate. They're starting to forget about me now.
We're all being a little forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Back home in Carrollton, all his neighbors put flags on their houses
after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them have been put away now. But mine is still up. As long as
I'm deployed out here, the flag stays."</TE>

<HD>Russia Takes a Steely Stance, Bans Imports of U.S. Poultry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Ministry here
twice in the last few days. A delegation of experts has been dispatched
from Washington to handle the crisis. Preparations for today's start of
tense negotiations in the latest U.S.-Russian flare-up dominated what
should have been a festive holiday weekend.</LD>
<LD>   It's not tension in Central Asia that has ruffled Russian feathers,
however, or a recent U.S. report slamming Moscow's human rights record.</LD>
<LD>   The angry standoff now commanding attention at the highest diplomatic
levels is what Moscow calls "the chicken problem."</LD>
<TE>   Russia officially imposed a ban on U.S. poultry imports Sunday,
ostensibly to pressure American producers to prove that the $630 million
in poultry products sent here each year are free of antibiotics,
undesirable additives and genetically modified feed.</TE>
<TE>   But against a backdrop of steep tariffs imposed by the Bush
administration on imported steel--a move that could cost Russia's
struggling industry upward of $1 billion--the sudden chop at U.S. chicken
seemed more the answering volley in a tit-for-tat trade war than a
genuine quest for quality assurance.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials offer contradictory assessments of how long it will
take to resolve the impasse, which the U.S. poultry industry expects will
cost it $50 million a month.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov shrugged off the dispute this weekend
as a "technical" problem that could be resolved in a few hours of
good-faith negotiating. However, Deputy Agriculture Minister Sergei
Dankvert warned that it is "absolutely premature to say that this problem
can be resolved in one or two days. The source of the problem is not here
in Russia."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush announced last week that he was imposing tariffs of 8%
to 30% on most imports of steel to the U.S. The move was seen abroad as
an attempt to save jobs in key steel-producing states where Republican
members of Congress face tough reelection battles this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of jobs that could be endangered in the poultry
industry by Russia's import ban is considerably higher. More than 300,000
people work in the U.S. poultry industry--about 50% more than in steel
production--and sales to Russia account for half of all U.S. poultry
exports and for at least 8% of total U.S. output.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Alexander Vershbow was called to the Foreign Ministry
once last week to explain the steel tariffs and again on Saturday to talk
turkey. While neither side has disclosed much detail of the talks aimed
at getting the poultry blockade lifted, the seriousness with which the
negotiations are being regarded was obvious in the frantic shuttle that
took Russian officials to their offices throughout the long weekend,
which began Friday with celebrations of International Women's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Russian media reports gave considerable attention Sunday to the
arrival of officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food
and Drug Administration and various food safety and animal husbandry
services. But the reports emphasized the negative, noting a spate of
discoveries of salmonella infection in U.S. poultry last week as well as
the usual contention that U.S. producers ship to Russia mostly dark-meat
hindquarters--parts left over because American consumers prefer white
meat.</TE>
<TE>   The chicken squabble currently riling Russia is actually an encore of
one in 1996, when then-President Boris N. Yeltsin banned U.S. imports for
about a week in an election-year bid to give Russian producers a better
shot at their own market.</TE>
<TE>   Russians were never big poultry eaters during the Communist era, when
transportation and refrigeration problems led to widespread spoilage and
discoloration. Most consumers disparaged the unappetizing "blue birds" in
favor of red meat.</TE>
<TE>   But the Russian appetite for chicken was whetted by President Bush's
father in 1991, when Washington sent tons of surplus chicken hindquarters
here as food aid. To this day, they are known as "Bush legs."</TE>
<TE>   Russia's domestic poultry industry was then on its knees, allowing
U.S. producers to gain control of the market. Yeltsin's bid to elbow out
the "Bush legs" was short-lived, since local producers couldn't provide
the meaty products consumers had become used to.</TE>
<TE>   Today, though, Russian poultry farmers argue that they are positioned
to supply more of their own market and should soon be able to make up the
60% U.S. share.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be enough to make a few small investments [in domestic
poultry farms] to reanimate them for meat production. There is no
catastrophe here," Naum Bayev, head of the Mikhailovsky agriculture
complex near Moscow, told RTR state television Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Romir Research Agency here, however, estimates that more than 70%
of poultry sales in Russia involve U.S. meat, which is 25% cheaper by
weight than domestic poultry owing to technological advantages in the
U.S. industry.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials have insisted that the poultry ban is unconnected to
the steel tariffs, and those U.S. officials undertaking the chicken talks
are unlikely to be empowered to discuss Russia's concerns about steel
losses.</TE>
<TE>   With neither side willing to concede that its recent trade ventures
might be counterproductive, the standoff threatens to shape up into a
protracted game of, well, chicken.</TE>

<HD>Attacks Persist Despite Talk of Cease-Fire</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Israelis and Palestinians bury more of their dead as
Cheney and the U.S. envoy prepare to visit in the hope of finding a
breakthrough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Faced with a relentless suicide bombing campaign that has
demoralized its citizens and emboldened Palestinian militants, Israel
said Sunday that it will keep attacking Palestinian-held territories
while the United States makes a new effort to secure a cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   Vice President Dick Cheney and U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni, due to
arrive here separately in a few days, will find more talk of war than of
peace, and widespread skepticism that the Bush administration can break
the cycle of violence.</LD>
<LD>   "Sending Zinni is like sending aspirin to treat cancer," said Shlomo
Ben-Ami, a former Israeli foreign minister. "His mission will not produce
results, because when you have this state of war and you have this
volcano erupting, you cannot negotiate a cease-fire unless it is in the
context of a political solution."</LD>
<TE>   Traumatized Israelis buried more of their dead Sunday, and right-wing
ministers chastised Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for dropping his demand
for seven days of quiet before a cease-fire can be reached. They said he
should instead retake the West Bank and Gaza Strip and oust the
Palestinian Authority. Palestinians buried their own dead from Israel's
ongoing military assault, and militants vowed more strikes inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon defended his decision to immediately implement a cease-fire, if
the U.S. can broker one.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to army veterans, he also said he intends to keep his promise
to lift travel restrictions Israel imposed on Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat after Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi was
assassinated in October.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has confined Arafat to the West Bank city of Ramallah, saying
he would be allowed freedom of movement only after all the men suspected
of killing Zeevi were arrested. The Palestinian Authority announced
Saturday that it had arrested the last suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "I insisted on this, and I did not let go, and finally, after all this
pressure, the people were arrested," Sharon said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon also told his audience that "there is a heavy battle in
progress" with the Palestinians. "I want to tell you that this battle
will continue," he said. "I also made this clear to our friends, the
Americans. . . . I have also made it clear to them that we will continue
our military operations."</TE>
<TE>   The former general said he contacted the Bush administration last week
as the violence intensified to say that Israel was prepared to
immediately implement a cease-fire if one could be negotiated. It was an
abrupt about-face from Sharon's previous insistence that he would never
negotiate until attacks stopped completely.</TE>
<TE>   But the prime minister said he will not engage in political talks
about a final settlement with the Palestinians until all attacks halt.</TE>
<TE>   Infrastructure Minister Avigdor Lieberman said it was a "grave
mistake" for Sharon to abandon the demand for seven days of quiet. "It
means that we are not truly capable of withstanding any sort of pressure,
that we have no red lines." Lieberman announced after the Cabinet session
that he will pull his tiny National Union-Israel Beitenu party out of the
government Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian as well as Israeli analysts said Sharon's gestures are
unlikely to change the dynamics on the ground, where Israel continues a
massive offensive against refugee camps and the security infrastructure
of the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, Palestinian suicide bombers are
blowing themselves up wherever they find Israelis gathered.</TE>
<TE>   "This war will not be over in one week," said Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
the Israeli army chief of staff, told reporters. "We shouldn't let it
tire us. We need mental strength to win the war."</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz said the army "will continue its operations on land, air and sea
over the coming days in a continuous way. There will be efforts to arrest
wanted Palestinians."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before midnight Sunday, a Palestinian gunman opened fire in a
party hall in Ashdonnot, on the southern Israeli coast, injuring one
teenager, police said. The gunman was captured when his weapon jammed.
Also Sunday, Israeli troops entered refugee camps in Bethlehem, looking
for militants. And near the West Bank town of Nablus, a 13-year-old boy
was shot dead when Israeli soldiers fired on stone-throwing youths,
Palestinian officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn today, Israeli troops and tanks entered Kalkilya, a West
Bank town close to the pre-1967 border with Israel, and troops began
house-to-house searches for militants. Palestinians reported that a
police station was destroyed and one person killed.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops have killed about 200 Palestinians in little more than
a week and have made 1,200 arrests, Mofaz said. Palestinians say that
many of those killed were civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian political analyst and pollster Khalil Shikaki said that
even if both sides agree to a cease-fire now, Arafat's ability to enforce
it is limited.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is not going to take any risk at this stage," Shikaki said.
"He would have to fight to achieve peace and quiet, and there could be a
lot of bloodshed" if his security forces took on the Palestinian
militias.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not expect anything good to come of Zinni's visit," said Hussam
Khader, a Palestinian parliament member and leader of Arafat's mainstream
Fatah movement in the militant Balata refugee camp. "Even if they agree
to a cease-fire, I do not think it will hold as long as Israel's siege
and escalation continues. Israel will have to do a lot to convince the
fighters to stop shooting."</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon could not afford to appear unwilling to explore political
options.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve Israelis, plus an infant whose parents brought her here a week
ago from South Africa to visit her grandparents, died in two separate
attacks Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The first attack was in the seaside town of Netanya, where a pair of
gunmen opened fire in a hotel before they were shot dead. That attack
also left an Israeli man and the infant dead. In the second attack, a
suicide bomber killed himself and 11 others at a trendy Jerusalem
restaurant. About 42 of the people injured in the two attacks remained
hospitalized Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Among those buried Sunday were the 9-month-old, Avia Malka, and a
couple, Danit Dagan, 25, and Ori Felix, 25, who were to be married next
month. Instead, they were buried side by side.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Israelis, many of them young people who regularly patronized
Cafe Moment in the affluent Rehavia neighborhood, gathered outside,
watching crews sweeping up glass and starting to make repairs. Some wept
and hugged each other. Others vowed that they will not be broken by a
terror campaign that has made an entire nation fearful of dining out,
celebrating life rituals or going shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "It's here, right amongst us, in the middle of Rehavia . . . the heart
of Old Jerusalem. The heart of the last attempt to preserve a semblance
of sanity in Jerusalem," wrote Arie Shavit in a front page opinion piece
in the Haaretz newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "We can no longer keep fooling ourselves," he wrote. "This war is
about the morning's coffee and croissant. About the beer in the evening.
About our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Inbal Levy, 23, stood with a small group of friends, trembling and
fighting back tears. She has worked at Cafe Moment for a month, Levy
said, but was off duty Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   A waitress who had started work Saturday night was killed in the
blast, Levy said. "I don't know how we get up and go back to work after
each of these," she said, her voice breaking. "It makes me angry that the
media refer to Palestinians as victims and not to us, the little people
who are just young people who want to live, to go out. Nobody sees what
is happening to us. We are losing our minds."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after she spoke, two Palestinians were killed near Jerusalem when
their car exploded. Police said they were on their way to carry out a
suicide attack and the bomb went off prematurely. Palestinians said the
car was hit by Israeli missiles.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, Israeli border patrol officers shot dead a
Palestinian they said tried to bypass a checkpoint. An army spokesman
said police found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, ammunition and grenades in
the Palestinian's backpack.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian opened fire on Israeli soldiers
guarding an isolated Jewish settlement, killing one soldier. The gunman
also stabbed a security officer before he was shot dead by troops, an
army spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Headquarters Bombed to Ruin</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The strike in Gaza comes in response to a pair of weekend
attacks on Israelis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY
</DL>
<LD>It was a vivid symbol of his power and of the state he expected to
create and lead. But much of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's headquarters lay in ruins Sunday after Israeli warships and
combat helicopters blasted the building from the air and sea with about
35 missiles in 45 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The attack came in retaliation for a pair of horrific Palestinian
assaults Saturday--a suicide bombing at a crowded Jerusalem cafe and a
shooting rampage at a hotel in the town of Netanya that left 16 people
dead and about 100 wounded.</LD>
<LD>   The strike on Arafat's offices also fit into Israel's larger campaign
of hitting the Palestinians relentlessly until they sue for peace. The
strategy was both psychological--delivering the message that Israel can
restrict and humiliate Arafat--and concrete. Scores of police and
security force buildings in the Gaza Strip have been leveled by aerial
bombardment in recent weeks.</LD>
<TE>   In one sprawling two-block complex here, 23 of 25 buildings housing
various branches of the police have been flattened or damaged beyond
repair.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say the strategy is not working. If anything, they say,
every escalation in the Israeli offensive inspires an escalation by
Palestinian militants--another wave of suicide bombers, another commando
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says it targets Arafat and his security services because they
have failed to rein in terrorists. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would like
to permanently sideline Arafat and work with a more malleable Palestinian
leader.</TE>
<TE>   But in all the eye-for-an-eye violence of the last months, Israel had
avoided damaging Arafat's offices. The larger compound was hit several
times, but not until early Sunday did Israeli forces zoom in on the
two-story stucco building where Arafat has held court since he returned
from exile and became president of the Palestinian Authority in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Here, he received numerous world leaders, including President Clinton.
Television cameras repeatedly chronicled the comings and goings of
important visitors as Arafat draped himself in the trappings of
sovereignty and nationhood.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, security guards picked through the pieces. Chunks of
concrete and shards of terra cotta tiles from the entryway's roof
littered the ground. The building was still standing, but it was in very
bad shape. Missiles had punched gaping holes where the windows once were
and had slammed through the roof of an annex containing political
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat was not present either during the airstrike or afterward
because he has been confined by Israel to the West Bank city of Ramallah
since early December.</TE>
<TE>   Someone had hung six photographs of Arafat from the ruins of the
building, as if to reassert his dwindling authority.</TE>
<TE>   "When this place is hit, it means all of Palestine is hit," declared
Dr. Jihad Atta, head of the Palestinian doctors union, who was part of a
small demonstration in support of Arafat. The protesters, who included a
number of doctors, lawyers and other professionals, along with gruff
gunmen, demanded an end to Israeli occupation and waved signs with
pictures of Sharon, prison bars drawn across his face.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1 p.m., the sound of an unmanned drone aircraft and distant
heavy-caliber machine-gun fire sent the people around Arafat's demolished
offices into a panic. They ran from the site, hopped in cars and beat a
hasty retreat.</TE>
<TE>   There was no airstrike then. But later Sunday, Israeli F-16 warplanes
returned to the northern end of Gaza to bombard a police station. No one
was hurt in the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelaziz Shahin, a veteran member of Arafat's Fatah movement who
spent 17 years in Israeli jails and now is the minister of supply, was in
his office with two reporters when the warplanes began flying overhead.
The jets made 13 roaring passes in 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what Israel means for us," Shahin said, gesturing skyward.
"How can I convince my people to make peace with Israelis?"</TE>
<TE>   He echoed other Gazans in saying that it is not likely that suicide
bombings or other reprisals will end any time soon, because many
Palestinians see no alternative to escalating bloodshed and feel they
have nothing to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday evening, Israeli helicopter gunships fired missiles at another
police post in the center of the Jabaliya refugee camp just north of Gaza
City as members of the radical Islamic movement Hamas were gathering to
celebrate Saturday's suicide bombing at the Jerusalem cafe. There were no
immediate reports of casualties.</TE>

<DL>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
</DL>
<LD>Skull by human skull, officials began Sunday to dismantle a key
memorial to the victims of atrocities committed by Cambodia's former
Khmer Rouge rulers.</LD>
<LD>   Buddhist monks prayed for the 300 victims of the Marxist regime whose
remains were part of a map of Cambodia made of skulls and displayed since
1979 as a testament to the regime's brutality. Museum officials said the
skulls were decaying.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of thousands of Cambodian and foreign visitors to the Tuol
Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh had viewed the grisly,
129-square-foot wall installation of skulls and bones.</LD>
<TE>   More than a million Cambodians died during the 1975-79 rule of the
radical regime because of disease, starvation, overwork and execution.
Leader Pol Pot died in 1998, but many of his top lieutenants live freely
in Cambodia after reaching defection deals with Prime Minister Hun Sen's
government.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is at a school the Khmer Rouge used as its chief prison and
torture center. The site was preserved by the Vietnamese army, which
deposed the regime and occupied Cambodia for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which
has been gathering evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities for eight years,
said he supported the removal of the skull map.</TE>
<TE>   "Cambodians and foreigners should be educated about the tragic past,
but publicity like this is not necessary. Scientific explanation does
more to help people understand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The empty place on the wall will be replaced by a large map of
Cambodia, identifying mass graves and prisons of the Khmer Rouge regime.
A photograph of the skull map will also be displayed.</TE>
<TE>   Cambodians have long debated the appropriateness of displaying
victims' remains in memorials. Cambodia's king wants the bones cremated,
but Hun Sen contends that memories of Khmer Rouge evils must be preserved
to educate future generations.</TE>

<DL>CALCUTTA, India
</DL>
<LD>A Hindu activist was killed and 32 people, mostly police, were
injured Sunday as Hindus clashed with Indian authorities trying to
enforce a ban on large gatherings.</LD>
<LD>   Police and paramilitary forces were attacked when they tried to break
up a crowd at a train station in Paldi, 12 miles south of Calcutta.
Police responded by beating the group back with sticks, lobbing tear gas
and finally opening fire, said local government administrator Alapan
Bandopadhyay.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, in Gujarat state in western India, two Hindus were killed
and six injured when police fired at a mob setting Muslim homes on fire
in Panvad village, about 60 miles from Ahmadabad.</LD>
<TE>   A police official said 30 to 40 houses were burned.</TE>
<TE>   In Paldi, dozens of Hindu hard-liners were defying a ban on gatherings
of more than four people. The ban was imposed after more than 600 people
were killed in Hindu-Muslim clashes beginning in late February.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the fundamentalist World Hindu Council, which organized
the gathering, was fatally shot. Twenty-five police officers were hurt by
objects hurled by the mob; seven activists were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Hindu group were preparing to hold a ceremony in
support of a disputed plan to build a temple on the site of a razed 16th
century mosque. The mosque was destroyed by Hindu fundamentalists in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 27, Muslims torched a train car filled with Hindus returning
from the site of the planned temple in Ayodhya, touching off more than a
week of deadly violence.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu hard-liners initially planned to begin construction of the
temple this Friday, but they now say they will wait for the Supreme Court
to rule.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 38-year-old Turkish man died of starvation, becoming the 48th
fatality in more than a year of hunger strike protests against Turkish
prison conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Yeter Guzel died in an Istanbul hospital, the fifth striker to die
this year, the Anatolian news agency said. Hundreds of prisoners and many
of their supporters launched the hunger strikes to protest plans for new
prisons with small cells. The protesters say the cells isolate prisoners

<LD>The party that propelled Vicente Fox into Mexico's presidency has
reelected its leader--who quickly vowed to improve a troubled
relationship with Fox himself.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Felipe Bravo Mena said his National Action Party and Fox are
trying "to walk much more closely together."</LD>
<LD>   The party's National Council voted Saturday to reelect Bravo Mena over
Sen. Carlos Medina Plascencia, who was widely seen as Fox's preference.
On Sunday, it elected a new Executive Committee that included a figure
close to Fox, apparently in an effort to smooth ties.</LD>

<HD>Court Extends Zimbabwe Voting by a Day</HD>
<DH>Africa: Long lines besiege polls in capital beyond original
deadline. Mugabe regime pledges to appeal ruling amid fears of civil
unrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>A high court ordered Sunday that this country's landmark
presidential election be extended into today after long lines of would-be
voters continued to besiege polling places here in the capital well
beyond the 7 p.m. deadline.</LD>
<LD>   But the government said it would appeal the ruling, sparking fears
among opposition supporters that incumbent Robert Mugabe might use a
presidential decree to close the polls, which could trigger widespread
civil unrest.</LD>
<LD>   Residents in some high-density Harare townships who had waited more
than 12 hours to cast their ballots Saturday--the first day of
voting--returned before dawn Sunday after their first bids to register
their choices had failed. Hundreds slept in lines in front of polling
places in order to retain their spots.</LD>
<TE>   "They are obviously trying to keep us from voting," said one man, who
gave his name as Tosto and who by noon Sunday had spent more than 15
hours waiting in line at a polling place in Glen View, a township on the
outskirts of Harare. "But even if it's five days, we are going to stay to
vote."</TE>
<TE>   The election, considered to be the most bitterly contested in
Zimbabwe's 22-year history, pits Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front against Morgan Tsvangirai, a former trade unionist
and the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change.</TE>
<TE>   Three lesser-known candidates are also in the running but are expected
to garner an insignificant fraction of the votes. Voters in the capital
were also casting ballots for mayoral and local council positions.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the extension could work to the advantage of the MDC,
even though they said many flaws in the electoral process had already
prevented the vote from being free and fair.</TE>
<TE>   "This is significant," said John Makumbe, a local political analyst
and chairman of the Zimbabwe branch of Transparency International, an
anti-corruption watchdog. "It is largely going to benefit the MDC,
because voting in rural areas has effectively ended, because the turnout
has not been so high and because there were many more polling stations in
the rural areas."</TE>
<TE>Critics Call Slow Pace of Balloting a Trick</TE>
<TE>   Government critics charged that the slow pace of allowing people to
vote was a deliberate attempt to frustrate MDC supporters in Harare,
which is widely considered to be an opposition stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   But George Charamba, the country's secretary of state for information
and publicity, insisted that the lines at several polling places in the
capital were not genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the strategy of the MDC," he said. "What they did was to
bring in their youth, some of whom had already voted, so as to create the
impression that we needed an extra day."</TE>
<TE>   Charamba said that elsewhere in the country, voting was completed
before the deadline and that by 7 p.m. Sunday, polling places were
virtually empty.</TE>
<TE>   "In rural areas, we are already dismantling our polling stations," he
said. "It won't make sense to extend [voting] just for this part of the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Before the election, the government cut the number of polling places
in urban areas, where the MDC dominates, and increased the number in
rural areas, where the ruling party enjoys the majority of its support.</TE>
<TE>   MDC officials said they had hoped for an even longer
extension--possibly two extra days--but expressed hope that one day would
be enough. Lawyers for the party said the government's appeal could not
prevent polling places from opening today.</TE>
<TE>   "The [court] order will continue to apply notwithstanding the appeal,"
said Innocent Chagonda, a lawyer for the MDC. He noted that if the
government's appeal proved successful, "it would be obvious that the vote
was not free and fair."</TE>
<TE>Pro-Mugabe Militias Are Blamed for Violence</TE>
<TE>   The run-up to the election was marred by violence and intimidation,
which opposition politicians and human rights officials blamed largely on
pro-government militias.</TE>
<TE>   The Zimbabwe Election Support Network, an umbrella group of local
independent monitors, reported that in the traditional ruling party
stronghold of Mashonaland West on Saturday, MDC voting monitors had been
chased from one polling place and their identity cards seized. The
observer group also said it had received reports that about 60 MDC voting
monitors had been abducted.</TE>
<TE>   But opposition leaders said the long lines at polling places in the
urban centers were testament to the fact that harassment had failed to
keep voters away from the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "People are so determined to exercise their right," said Paul Madzore,
an MDC member of parliament. "We did not expect voter apathy here."</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Makumbe warned of turmoil if the government's appeal
of the voting extension succeeded or if Mugabe tried to close the polls
by presidential decree.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a very strong possibility of civil strife," Makumbe said. "A
lot of people in the queues are saying, 'We are not leaving without
voting.' ZANU-PF militias could try to drive them off, and that could
result in clashes."</TE>

<HD>Few Vote in Republic of Congo Poll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo
</DL>
<LD>Voters in the oil-rich Republic of Congo showed little enthusiasm
Sunday for a presidential vote in which the central African nation's
leader was running virtually unopposed for a seven-year term.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, the poll, the first in a decade, was seen as an
important step toward lasting peace after a brief but bloody civil war in
1997 that drove as much as a third of the former French colony's 2.8
million people from their homes and left about 10,000 dead.</LD>
<LD>   But the lack of any serious challenger to President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso, a Marxist who ruled from 1979 to 1991 and seized power
again during the '97 war, undermined the credibility of the vote.</LD>
<TE>   Sassou-Nguesso's two main opponents, both living in exile, had been
barred from running, and the only other heavyweight contender pulled out
Friday, alleging irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout was light, and even at the polling station where the president
cast his ballot--and where his portrait stared down at voters from the
wall--it was estimated at just 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Some people said there was confusion over registration. The first
dozen voters at one station were turned back because their names were not
on a list. "I registered here but my name is not listed, so that's it.
I'm going home," said an opposition supporter.</TE>
<TE>   There were no reports of violent incidents. Borders were closed for
the day and cars banned from the streets of Brazzaville, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Joaquin Miranda, the head of the European Union's observer team, said
it was too early to say whether the poll had been fair overall, but he
added that there was some merit in opposition claims about a lack of
transparency.</TE>
<TE>   After withdrawing Friday, ex-Prime Minister Andre Milongo urged his
supporters to boycott the vote but avoid trouble.</TE>

<HD>Local Afghan Leaders Get a Crash Course in Governing</HD>
<DH>Asia: Interim prime minister gathers 32 governors in the capital to
lay out national priorities and teach the basics of administration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Fighting may still rage in this country's eastern reaches, but
interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai wants to get things in order--so he
summoned the 32 provincial governors Sunday for their first joint meeting
and mapped out a program he hopes will put war-torn Afghanistan on the
road to normality.</LD>
<LD>   The central government instructed each governor to immediately start
working on six goals: reviving local administrations; providing security,
in part by taking arms away from the public; establishing police forces;
fighting drug cultivation and smuggling; rooting out pockets of Taliban
and Al Qaeda resistance; and guaranteeing fundamental human and political
rights.</LD>
<LD>   Issuing the orders to the governors, who were appointed by Karzai in
consultation with local communities, was an important step toward
reestablishing central authority, said the Interior Ministry's chief of
local organizations, Mohammed Ebrahim Seleandari.</LD>
<TE>   A power vacuum was created last year when the Taliban regime collapsed
and its governors and other local officials fled helter-skelter, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Military commanders or respected individuals emerged with the consent
of the public to take control of each province. In most cases, Karzai
later legitimized the people's choice. But now he is trying to bring all
the governors into line with his administration's main goals.</TE>
<TE>'Affection and Unity'</TE>
<TE>   Although the governors are august potentates in their provinces, and
in appearance are mostly imposing graybeards in long robes and turbans,
they trooped into Sunday's meeting like obedient schoolchildren holding
their notebooks to receive marching orders from officials in Kabul, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   "Now everybody will be going on in a unified way," said Moulawi
Ziaulhaq Haqyam, governor of Bagram province.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the meeting, held at the Interior Ministry, Haqyam said the
session indicated "a mood of cooperation and coordination" and showed the
"affection and unity" shared by different parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Ebrahim Mashfeq, governor of Khowst province, said the
meeting and a subsequent seminar went over the fundamentals of governing,
so that the provincial leaders will devote their time to priorities and
not waste effort on insignificant matters.</TE>
<TE>   Mashfeq said the interim government in Kabul is legitimate in the eyes
of most Afghans, "extraordinarily more than the Taliban regime was. They
were fierce, while this government is the one of peace and security."</TE>
<TE>   Seleandari said the central government will be evaluating the
governors from next week on to see how they are implementing the goals
laid out Sunday. "If they do not apply the strategies we have defined,
then there will be decisive action to replace the governors," he said.</TE>
<TE>Disarmament a Priority</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important tasks given to the governors, Seleandari
said, was to ensure security by getting weapons out of the hands of
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as weapons such as Kalashnikovs and ammunition are with the
people, there cannot be stable security," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another task seems equally daunting: the struggle against drugs. The
governors are supposed to be the first line of defense in the drug war,
and they have been assigned to find ways to inspire farmers to grow crops
other than opium poppies, Seleandari said. Until last year, Afghanistan
was the world's top producer of opium.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the will of the interim government and the whole world
community that we end this tragic and dangerous trade," Seleandari said.</TE>
<TE>   If farmers persist in growing poppies despite the government's wishes,
he said, governors are supposed to organize police and army troops to
destroy the fields and search out and raze any drug storage facilities
they find.</TE>

<HD>9 Detainees Not Iranian, Tehran Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN
</DL>
<LD>Iran insisted Sunday that none of its citizens had been arrested in
Afghanistan, after an Afghan politician said a Revolutionary Guards
general and eight other Iranians were detained and handed over to U.S.
forces.</LD>
<LD>   Tehran's statement followed reports that an Iranian group led by a
Gen. Razavi was arrested Tuesday while clandestinely distributing money
and weapons to allies in western Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "No Iranian national is among those arrested in Afghanistan,"
government spokesman Abdullah Ramezanzadeh told reporters. "We do not
have any military presence in Afghanistan."</LD>
<TE>   In Kandahar, Afghanistan, politician Izzatullah Wasafi said the
Iranians were handed over to U.S. authorities at the air base there,
where coalition forces are holding Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security
advisor, said some people had been taken into custody who "have some
relationship to Iran" but that they were still being debriefed.</TE>
<TE>   "What we cannot have is to have Iran playing, surreptitiously, games
in the politics in Afghanistan or trying to create conditions that would
be dangerous for American forces," she said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the
Press."</TE>
<TE>   Wasafi, who said he had been involved in tracking the Iranian group's
activities, said the group included three Iranian border guards and five
other members of the Revolutionary Guards--a trusted Iranian military
corps with close ties to Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</TE>
<TE>   Wasafi said three Afghans serving as the Iranians' guides also were
apprehended in the operation, which he described as a trap set by a
militia commander in Shindand, in Herat province about 100 miles east of
the Iranian border.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wasafi, the commander pretended he was interested in the
Iranians' offer of money, but when the group approached a meeting point,
the commander's soldiers fired off warning shots, stopped the three
vehicles carrying the 12 men and took them into custody.</TE>

<HD>Britain Seeks to Halt Georgia Execution</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: A forceful movement hopes to have the dual citizen's
sentence commuted. His guilt is beyond doubt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>British leaders are waging an unusually strong campaign to convince
Georgia state officials to spare the life of a British citizen who is
scheduled to be executed Tuesday for a 1985 murder.</LD>
<LD>   The guilt of Tracy L. Housel--sentenced to death for killing Jeanne
Drew, whom he met at a truck stop northeast of Atlanta--is not in
question. The doubts are about his mental health at the time of the
murder, as well as his legal defense.</LD>
<LD>   The case "has haunted me for years," confessed his former lawyer,
Walter M. Britt.</LD>
<TE>   Although Britain, like all other western European countries, has
outlawed the death penalty, the Housel case marks the first time that
government officials have weighed in on behalf of a British citizen on
death row in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   British Foreign Minister Jack Straw has called Georgia Gov. Roy
Barnes, the British ambassador has called the Georgia Board of Pardons
and Paroles and more than 100 members of Parliament say they favor
clemency for Housel, who is one of four British nationals on death row in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Vera Baird, a member of Parliament and the Queens Council, plans to
speak on Housel's behalf today when the parole board holds a hearing on
Housel's clemency bid.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be bringing a letter from the prime minister [Tony Blair]
showing that he wishes the sentence to be commuted" to life without
possibility of parole, Baird said over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member board has the sole power to commute a death sentence
in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The case has not generated much attention in this country, but it has
been covered extensively in the British press. On Thursday, death penalty
opponents demonstrated outside 10 Downing Street urging Blair to weigh
in, as Mexican President Vicente Fox did on behalf of a Mexican national
facing the death penalty last year in Oklahoma. That man's sentence was
commuted to life.</TE>
<TE>   The British government's support for Housel represents a new step in
that country's opposition to the death penalty, said Clive
Stafford-Smith, a New Orleans-based attorney who specializes in death
penalty appeals and is a British native.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Stafford-Smith and others failed to persuade then-Prime
Minister John Major to intervene on behalf of Nick Ingram, a convicted
murderer who was executed in Georgia. Ingram, who like Housel had dual
British and U.S. citizenship, is the only Briton who has been executed in
the U.S. since the federal government reinstated the death penalty in
1976.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative comes at a time of growing ferment against the death
penalty in various parts of the world, particularly Western Europe;
countries are not admitted into the European Union if they have the death
penalty. Britain is one of 75 nations that has abolished capital
punishment for all crimes; 109 countries around the world have either
banned the death penalty or have ceased using it.</TE>
<TE>   There are 118 foreign nationals from 33 countries on U.S. death rows.</TE>
<TE>A Hope for Compassion</TE>
<TE>   "We are not asking anyone to forgive Tracy, just to show some
compassion," said Stafford-Smith, who also will speak to the pardon board
today. "He would spend the rest of his life in prison if we succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Also protesting the pending execution are Amnesty International, the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights and Sister Helen Prejean, the noted
death penalty foe. She also plans to speak on Housel's behalf today.</TE>
<TE>   But Gwinnett County prosecutors, who during a 1986 trial described
Housel as a predator who "deserves no mercy," firmly assert that he
should die for his crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Gwinnett County Dist. Atty. Danny Porter described Housel as a
calculating killer. "He's like Ted Bundy," Porter said, referring to the
Florida serial killer executed in 1989 for murdering eight women.</TE>
<TE>   "He's charming and smart. If you met him at a truck stop, you'd take
him home to meet your sister and then he'd kill her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Through his attorneys, Housel, now 43, has expressed remorse for
murdering Drew.</TE>
<TE>   His murder conviction and death sentence have been upheld by the
Georgia Supreme Court twice, a federal district court in Atlanta and the
federal appeals court there. The U.S. Supreme Court has twice declined to
review the case, most recently in February.</TE>
<TE>   Appellate attorneys Robert L. McGlasson and Mary Elizabeth Wells
contend Housel should be given clemency because he had a serious mental
defect at the time of the crime and received constitutionally deficient
representation from a court-appointed lawyer who was trying his first
capital murder case.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney, Britt, decided that the case against Housel was strong
and encouraged him to plead guilty. Such a plea is generally accompanied
by a promise from prosecutors not to seek the death penalty, but not in
this case.</TE>
<TE>   Housel had been charged with murdering Drew, raping her, stealing her
car and using her credit cards. Prosecutors dropped the rape charge in
exchange for the guilty plea, a deal that yielded no benefit to Housel.</TE>
<TE>   During the penalty phase, Britt mounted a skimpy presentation, calling
only three witnesses and taking only 30 minutes, according to court
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Years after the trial, new lawyers were appointed to represent Housel
and discovered he was abused as a child and suffers from severe
hypoglycemia, a blood sugar imbalance that, if left untreated, can render
a person psychotic, according to experts retained by the defense.</TE>
<TE>   In the federal district court appeal, Dr. Buris Boshell, an
endocrinology expert, testified that Housel "underwent an acute state of
hypoglycemia, exacerbated by alcohol, at the time of the crime."</TE>
<TE>   "When in the throes of a hypoglycemic episode, as [Housel] was at the
time of this crime, Mr. Housel did not have the mental capacity to
distinguish between right and wrong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney scoffed at the suggestion. "Most people who have
hypoglycemia eat a candy bar; they don't rape and murder," Porter said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other mental health experts who examined Housel for the hearing
concluded that he "suffers from brain damage and severe psychological
impairments," according to a recent defense brief.</TE>
<TE>   Housel, who was born in the British territory of Bermuda, spent a good
deal of his youth living in poverty in Rhode Island. He was frequently
beaten by his father and neglected by his mother, who married at age 14
and was an alcoholic, according to court testimony. Housel also suffered
several head injuries that went untreated because his father did not
believe in doctors, according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But Britt did not learn any of this when representing Housel. In fact,
both Housel and his mother testified during the trial's penalty phase
that he had a "normal" upbringing.</TE>
<TE>   Britt acknowledged that he provided an inadequate defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to live with the fact that I helped to put my client on death
row. If I had known then what I know now, I would never have advised Mr.
Housel to plead guilty," Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that if the evidence of Housel's mental problems had been
presented to the jury, his client would not have been convicted of
capital murder. "Even if we did not prevail at trial, it would have
provided the jury with a reason to spare Tracy's life."</TE>
<TE>   But a federal trial judge and the federal appeals court have rejected
arguments that Britt's performance was constitutionally deficient. "A
failure to investigate [the client's background] is not a unique category
of counsel omission that automatically satisfies" the Supreme Court test
for ineffective counsel, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
last year.</TE>
<TE>Jury Heard Allegations</TE>
<TE>   Once Britt was told that Housel's upbringing was normal, the attorney
could reasonably have decided to investigate no further, the appeals
court said.</TE>
<TE>   Housel's backers also contend that his rights were violated during the
trial's penalty phase because prosecutors told jurors about other crimes
Housel allegedly was involved in--including a murder in Texas and
assaults in Iowa and New Jersey--even though he was not charged in those
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Under Georgia law, prosecutors may present evidence of unadjudicated
offenses during the penalty phase of a capital murder trial. Georgia and
Texas have the loosest standards in the nation permitting such evidence
during sentencing. In California, a jury is permitted to consider it only
if the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed
that offense.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in a ruling stemming from a Texas case, the Inter-American
Court of Human Rights concluded that it is a violation of human rights to
introduce such evidence. That decision is not binding on any U.S. court.</TE>
<TE>   Housel's attorneys claim that the introduction of the unadjudicated
offenses, which were a central component of the prosecution's evidence in
the penalty phase, violated the 8th Amendment's bar against cruel and
unusual punishment. But the 11th Circuit Court declined last year to
consider the merits of this argument.</TE>

<HD>If Simon Loses, GOP Conservatives Could Rethink Riordan Snub</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one walks away without a scratch from a crash like Richard
Riordan's spin-out in last week's California Republican primary. So it's
no surprise the White House is being pounded in political circles for
recruiting the former Los Angeles mayor into the governor's race. Even
mild-mannered Gerald R. Ford, not generally known for edgy political
commentary, told the New York Times that Riordan's fall was "an adverse
reflection on [the White House's] judgment."</LD>
<LD>   Well, maybe. The White House deserves criticism for its performance as
Riordan's campaign headed toward defeat. But it's too early to say
Riordan's loss reflects bad judgment on the part of Karl Rove and the
rest of the White House political team. To the contrary; it's entirely
possible the general election will validate Rove's initial view that the
California GOP needed a more centrist candidate to beat embattled
Democrat Gray Davis. Arguably, what's really in the dock now is the
political judgment of the conservative activists who powered Bill Simon
Jr.'s nomination. In so many words, the Republican hard-core defiantly
told the White House a social conservative could win statewide in
California. Now they just have to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   Which is not to say the White House didn't make mistakes in the race.
It encouraged Riordan into the contest, and then stood by as both Simon
and Secretary of State Bill Jones relentlessly attacked his credentials
as a legitimate Republican.</LD>
<TE>   Rove confidantes argue that the White House "by convention and
practice" could not intervene to defend one candidate against another in
such a hotly contested Republican primary. But that didn't mean Bush
couldn't have issued a blanket statement describing all three contenders
as acceptable Republicans he would be happy to work with.</TE>
<TE>   The White House silence was the equivalent of an officer who sends his
soldiers into enemy fire and then stays safely in the trench. That
timidity not only hurt Riordan but is likely to damage Bush's broader
hopes of creating a more inclusive Republican Party. The next time the
White House comes calling, moderate GOP candidates might be forgiven for
wondering if Rove and the president are going to stick with them when the
charges start flying.</TE>
<TE>   But that's a long way from saying Rove was wrong to recruit Riordan in
the first place. For all the problems in his campaign, documented in a
post-primary story by Times reporters Mark Z. Barabak and Nicholas
Riccardi, Riordan initially was a plausible solution to a very real
Republican problem: the GOP's collapse with moderate California voters.
In the 1980s, Republicans controlled the center in California, polarizing
swing voters against Democrats who opposed the death penalty or welfare
reform. But in the 1990s Democrats moved to the center on crime and
welfare, neutralizing those vulnerabilities. That has allowed Democratic
candidates to turn swing voters against Republicans who oppose abortion
and gun control, support school vouchers and favor industry on
environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Clinton and Al Gore used that new complex of wedge issues to
pulverize George Bush, father and son, in the state over the past three
presidential elections. Davis employed the same weapons perhaps even more
devastatingly in 1998 when he routed socially conservative Republican
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren by 1.6 million votes.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who supports abortion and gun control, could have closed off
the most effective of those attacks. Simon, who takes conservative
positions on those issues, may instead face a virtual playback of the
Lungren campaign. Simon maintains he can court the center by switching
the subject from guns and abortion. But it's a safe bet Davis will be
talking about them--constantly. Within hours of Simon's victory, Davis
was on CNN describing his opponent as "pro-life, pro-gun, pro-voucher"
and "out of step with Californians."</TE>
<TE>   "The question," says one senior GOP strategist close to the White
House, "is whether this is New Jersey again." Indeed, the California
contest is showing early similarity to the Republican gubernatorial race
last year in New Jersey, another culturally liberal coastal state that
has trended away from the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey GOP leaders rallied behind former Rep. Bob Franks. Like
Riordan, he backed abortion and gun control. But a big turnout by social
conservatives gave the nomination to former Jersey City Mayor Bret
Schundler, who leaned right on both issues. The Wall Street Journal and
other conservative opinion leaders rejoiced that the party had selected a
real conservative (just as the same voices are doing with Simon).
Schundler promised, Simon-like, to highlight other issues. Then the
Democratic nominee, James McGreevey, proceeded to pummel him on guns and
abortion and coast to victory. It was all as predictable as getting stuck
at the tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike.</TE>
<TE>   Abortion and guns aren't winning issues for Democrats everywhere; as
the country's political allegiance continues to sort out along cultural
and regional lines, conservative positions (particularly on guns) hold
the upper hand through the South and the Mountain West. But along the
coasts, in the blue states that voted for Gore, social conservatives
still have to demonstrate they can win statewide elections against
centrist Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has a better chance than most because Davis heads into the
general election bleeding on energy and the budget. But unless Simon can
concoct a better answer than "next question" when pressed about guns and
abortion, history suggests he'll have a hard time focusing the voters'
attention on Davis' vulnerabilities rather than his own.</TE>
<TE>   More than Simon's fate is probably at stake for California
Republicans. The senior GOP strategist says local Republicans encouraged
the White House to solicit Riordan because they wanted to prove the party
could still win statewide in California. The ultimate goal was to
encourage Bush to contest the state in 2004. If Davis now rides guns and
abortion to another victory, the strategist says, the odds of Bush
battling for California next time will drop.</TE>
<TE>   Which means the argument over the White House's role in the primary
could look very different in November. Today, it's the White House's
judgment under fire. But if Simon loses and prompts Bush to bail on
California in 2004, the conservatives who rejected Riordan may face the
toughest questions.</TE>

<LD>High school students can end the nerve-racking wait for SAT scores
early, but it will cost them.</LD>
<LD>   Students who used the Internet to register for the college entrance
exam received an e-mail two weeks after the test telling them scores were
available online for a $13 fee. If the students waited eight more days,
they could access their scores for free by mail or computer.</LD>
<LD>   The exam's New York-based owner, the College Board, said the service

<LD>A study of 4,714 French men bolsters evidence that the top number
in blood pressure readings is better than the lower number at predicting

bottom, or diastolic, number to reduce the health risks of high blood

<LD>With the Hubble Space Telescope on its way to new discoveries and
their own flight drawing to a close, Columbia's astronauts said they're
thrilled but surprised at how well all of their repairs went.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a very ambitious mission in front of us," said space shuttle
pilot Duane Carey, "and I admit that I had my doubts as to whether we
could safely accomplish everything we had on our plate."</LD>
<LD>   All that remained for the seven astronauts, besides packing, was
Tuesday morning's landing.</LD>
<TE>   Columbia's astronauts gave Hubble $172 million worth of new equipment
last week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Women who have a few alcoholic drinks a week have an almost 15%
lower chance of developing high blood pressure than teetotalers, new
research shows.</LD>
<LD>   However, the study also found that consuming more than about 1 1/2
drinks daily increases the high blood pressure risk by 30% compared with
nondrinkers. The increased risk was associated equally with wine, beer
and hard liquor.</LD>
<LD>   The reduced risk among light drinkers appeared strongest with beer,
though more research is needed to clarify whether the type of drink
really makes a difference, said the authors, led by Dr. Ravi Thadhani of
Harvard University Medical School.</LD>

<HD>Ridge Plans Color-Coded Alert System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Homeland Security chief Thomas J. Ridge said Sunday he is preparing
a five-stage, multicolored alert system that will allow federal
authorities to more precisely warn the public about domestic terrorism
dangers.</LD>
<LD>   The system is a response to criticism that the four broad terror
alerts issued by the government since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11
have alarmed the public while providing little or no useful information.</LD>
<LD>   The system will assign colors based on the seriousness of the threat,
but Ridge said he would not divulge "the colors of the rainbow" to be
used in the system until a formal release this week.</LD>
<TE>   Reports in Time and Newsweek magazines Sunday said it will begin with
green, the lowest status, and move to blue, yellow, orange and red as the
perceived danger intensifies.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge sidestepped questions about whether the public will be directly
informed of alerts under the system. "We've discovered since 9/11, even
when you send out [alerts] through the FBI, ultimately it becomes in the
public domain. But public safety is the primary purpose behind this, so
the public is certainly going to know."</TE>

<HD>Andersen in Sales Talks</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The accounting firm Andersen, damaged by its connections to
bankrupt client Enron Corp., is talking with Big Five accounting firm
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu about selling some or all of its operations,
according to reports.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations began last week between New York-based Deloitte and
Chicago-based Andersen, the New York Times reported late Sunday on its
Web site. The newspaper cited sources involved in the talks who spoke
anonymously.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies are
investigating Andersen's work for former energy giant Enron Corp., which
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 amid questionable
accounting practices. Investigators have centered on the alleged
shredding of Enron documents by Andersen, which was Enron's chief
auditor.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Times reported that negotiations between Deloitte and
Andersen began last week. A deal, the terms of which aren't known, could
be announced this week. The newspaper said discussions are still "fluid,"
and no decision has been reached on whether Andersen would be sold in
pieces or completely.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported on its Web site Sunday
night that Andersen is negotiating with federal prosecutors over possible
criminal indictments.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal said the company will meet with the Justice Department to
try to reach an agreement that would avoid "criminal
obstruction-of-justice charges."</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times said the key points being discussed by Deloitte and
Andersen include how the former can avoid the "legal and financial
liabilities" being faced by Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Several high-profile clients have defected from Andersen in the wake
of the Enron collapse. Last week, Delta Air Lines and Freddie Mac fired
the accounting firm. Other defections include Merck &amp; Co. and SunTrust
Banks.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Deadly Spike in Racial Violence Against Asian Americans</HD>
<DH>Crime: A consortium cites misperceptions and generalizations as
factors in the post-Sept. 11 increase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Racist attacks against Asian Americans spiked significantly
nationwide after Sept. 11, claiming two lives and causing injuries to
dozens more, according to a report released today by the National Asian
Pacific American Legal Consortium.</LD>
<LD>   The study, "Backlash: When America Turned on Its Own," tracked 243
incidents in the three-month period after the terrorist attacks. By
contrast, bias-based attacks against Asian Americans for typical 12-month
periods number around 400, according to the report.</LD>
<LD>   Victims included a Sikh American from Mesa, Ariz., who was shot and
killed by a gunman who yelled "I stand for America all the way," and a
Pakistani American grocer who was killed in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Nonviolent crimes against Asian Americans ranged from vandalism to
verbal harassment. Businesses have been pelted with Molotov cocktails and
homes burned to the ground, according to the report. Among those targeted
have been women and children.</TE>
<TE>   Singled out as targets, according to the report, have been South Asian
Americans, including Indian and Pakistani Americans, but especially Sikh
Americans, a religious group often mistakenly perceived to be Arab
because many of their men wear turbans and long beards.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, some Americans have fallen into the grave
misconception that all Arab Americans and Muslim Americans are
terrorists, and therefore, anyone who even looks Arab or Muslim has
become a potential target for violent retribution," the report reads.</TE>
<TE>   The study is a compilation of hate crime statistics provided by law
enforcement agencies and supplemented by hate incident reports from
individuals, community groups and media reports. The statistics were
gathered by the consortium and its affiliates: the Asian Pacific American
Legal Center, Asian Law Caucus and the Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium recommends that law enforcement step up its collection
of data on hate crimes and urges the passage of a measure that would
expand the federal hate crimes law, which would allow prosecutors to seek
additional penalties for hate crimes in states that lack such laws.</TE>
<TE>   The study also recommends that the government and law enforcement
officials provide diversity and sensitivity training to all employees. It
also criticizes the U.S. Justice Department for interviewing and
detaining thousands of Arab Americans, saying such practices arouse
suspicion of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   In one case cited in the study, a 20-year-old Pakistani college
student detained in a Mississippi jail was beaten by inmates while guards
allegedly ignored his cries for help.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 80% of the incidents during the three-month period occurred in
the first weeks after the attacks. Twenty-seven percent occurred in
schools; 29% in the workplace, the study reported.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California victims included a 51-year-old Sikh American woman
who was stabbed twice in the head by two motorcyclists at a stoplight in
San Diego, and a Northridge liquor store owner who was beaten by two men
with metal poles.</TE>

<HD>Like 'Jaws,' El Toro Kept O.C.'s Other Issues Out of the Water</HD>
<DH>Politics: Beast of a debate, partly tamed by voters, has obscured
larger questions of growth and leadership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE EVAN HALPER</AU>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Buffa looks at the El Toro debate--the whole wrangling,
two-fisted brawl--and sees a movie.</LD>
<LD>   "Jaws," to be exact.</LD>
<LD>   "When 'Jaws' came along . . . it became bigger than just a film," said
Buffa, a political analyst and former Costa Mesa City Council member.
"And El Toro has become much bigger than just a political issue."</LD>
<TE>   In the near-decade since the Pentagon announced that it would close
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, the fate of the 4,700-acre airfield
has dominated local politics.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by the county's embrace of economic growth as a near-religion,
the drive to convert El Toro into an international airport ran smack into
suburbanites' dawning realization that constant growth carries a high
price: more freeways, smog and people.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing battle, not-in-my-backyard politics led to last week's
fourth public referendum on El Toro, which not only blocked the airport
plan but also forced a shift of power in the county's top political
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   And it sent yet another signal that the Orange County defined by
suburban complacency and conservative Republican conformity has been
supplanted--at least on this issue--by an energized and fractious body
politic in which petition-slinging combatants refuse to say die.</TE>
<TE>   That's not necessarily a good thing, said Norm Grossman, a longtime
slow-growth advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "It suggests a failure of long-range thinking," Grossman said. "This
whole thing has locked the county into a yes-or-no mode, and people
aren't willing to break out of this. . . . It's doubtful that anyone has
learned any lessons from it."</TE>
<TE>   The lengthy wrestling match prompted the Navy last week to announce
that it intends to sell part or all of the base, in keeping with the
limits of Measure W. Before the Navy reached that juncture, El Toro had
hijacked public debate to the point of obsession and cost taxpayers tens
of millions of dollars in legal fees, advertising, planning and lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the debate has laid bare a fundamental flaw in the
way the county deals with political issues, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current structure of supervisors representing districts, the
greater good invariably falls victim to the small and parochial, however
valid the merits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult for the Board of Supervisors to represent the
interests of the county as a whole," said Alan Saltzstein, a Cal State
Fullerton political science professor. "Supervisors tend to view the
world in terms of their district, and cities in terms of what's going on
in their cities. People have a hard time sitting back and looking at
what's best for the region as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Saltzstein believes such a conflict of visions has left a wide range
of local issues unaddressed, from the need for increased capacity of mass
transit to the growing gap between wages and housing prices.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro debate "never seemed to get beyond 'What is it going to do
to my city?' " Saltzstein said. "It's an endemic problem to the county.
Where do you put the jails? Who pays for cleaning up the beaches? These
things are regional problems that you would think the county would feel
the need to work together on."</TE>
<TE>   And it has become a litmus test in local elections, said Sandy Genis,
an urban planner and former Costa Mesa mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "You're running for judge of Fullerton or something, and they ask you,
'What do you think of El Toro?' " Genis said, adding that political
careers have been bankrolled or derailed over the issue. "There's gobs of
homeless people, roads are a mess, flood control is underfunded, and we
have water quality problems. Hopefully, we'll talk about something else
now."</TE>
<TE>   Genis recalled a recent community forum in which candidates for
district attorney and sheriff were questioned by voters.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people in the audience asking every single D.A. candidate,
every single sheriff candidate, 'What do you think of El Toro?' " she
said. "I thought, 'What in the world has El Toro got to do with anything
here?' "</TE>
<TE>   But candidates who tried to point out that the offices they sought had
no connection to El Toro were pressed until they came up with a stance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most combative issue I've ever seen in Orange County, and
we've lived here since 1958," said Marion Bergeson, a former Republican
state senator, assemblywoman and secretary of education.</TE>
<TE>   Bergeson believes some of the passions stirred by the El Toro debate
grew from the strength of the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   "When jobs are hard to find and you are trying to put food on the
table, people are not as concerned about quality-of-life issues," she
said. "But when things are going well and when the economy is strong, the
infrastructure is challenged, major roads and schools are crowded. When
they see the effects of clogged freeways and crowded schools, then they
become much more militant, much more concerned about the impact of any
further development."</TE>
<TE>   Bergeson said the El Toro debate accented the need for a Board of
Supervisors elected at large and for adopting a form of government with a
strong central county leader. County residents, she said, have lost
"faith and trust" in elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of the problems, frankly, is we have lacked strong
leadership. It really gets down to a point of being able to have the
trust and confidence of people who voted you into office," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For Robert Lang, the El Toro debate was a watershed moment in Orange
County's development, in both fact and outlook.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County doesn't want to be the Sunbelt boom region it once
was," said Lang, director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech
and a demographics expert who has written extensively about Orange
County. "If it was still aggressively courting all kinds of business, a
decision like [Measure W] wouldn't have been made. The county is still
aggressively courting business, but now it is a certain kind of
[high-tech] business."</TE>
<TE>   Almost without notice from the outside, Orange County has undergone an
impressive demographic evolution in the past decade, its population
growing by a fifth as it changed from predominately white exurbia into a
churning, multiethnic economic engine.</TE>
<TE>   More people come into Orange County to work each day than drive out
for jobs in Los Angeles or elsewhere. Estimates put the county's economic
output--similar to gross domestic product--on a par with those of
Finland, Venezuela and Thailand, and Orange County's economy would rank
about 30th in the world if it were a country.</TE>
<TE>   But Lang believes the county is slowing down what had been a rush to
urbanization.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's seen its period of enthusiastic growth come to an end,"
he said. "The old model was based on bringing quantity of businesses in.
Now it is about quality. It's not like the place is in decline. It is
shifting gears to a more mature model of growth, a more selective model
of growth."</TE>
<TE>   And it is doing so self-consciously, said Rick Cole, former executive
director of the Southern California Local Government Commission and
current city manager of Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County is among the older suburbs that are starting to face a
very real identity crisis," Cole said. "Nothing illustrates that more
than what to do with the big hole in the middle of it. . . . Everyone is
waking up to the fact that what El Toro becomes has a big part in what
Orange County becomes."</TE>
<TE>   He described "an adolescent identity crisis" in which the county must
decide what it will be: a sea of endless suburbs with roads carved
through the Cleveland National Forest, or a less congested region that
might not have the same economic punch.</TE>
<TE>   "All these questions are increasingly urgent," Cole said. "They have
been crystallized in what started as a parochial fight between NIMBYs and
pro-business camps on El Toro, and it is now a battle for the soul of the
county."</TE>
<TE>   Marion Pack, a longtime activist on political issues with roots in the
1970s anti-nuclear movement, sees the stirrings of political maturity in
the El Toro fight. The debate grew from a South County NIMBY issue into a
realization that individuals could unite and achieve broader results, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "When people feel they can make a change at the local level, they
begin to make connections with the bigger picture," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pack, who was active in several anti-airport efforts, including
Measure W, recalled standing outside a North County Costco trying to
enlist support for a plan to convert the base into parkland.</TE>
<TE>   "People just said it was already an air base, they flew airplanes out
of there, so why not make it an airport?" Pack said. "But then you would
take them a little bit below the surface and say, 'Do you realize what we
might be able to do instead of an airport?' and the lights went on--'I
never thought of that.' "</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, she said, the battle came down to grass-roots organizing
by anti-airport forces against a political and business structure that
wants a regional airport.</TE>
<TE>   While Newport Beach residents, who live beneath the John Wayne Airport
flight path, overwhelmingly favor a new airport at El Toro, there was
little of the broad-based organizing that defined the South County
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the midst of the El Toro battle, a grass-roots anti-growth
movement arose in Newport Beach to slow development--a position in
keeping with some of the motives behind the anti-El Toro group.</TE>
<TE>   "They can generate a grass-roots movement, because they did it on
that," Pack said. "Obviously, there wasn't the passion for it [on El
Toro]."</TE>
<TE>   Buffa said the passion hijacked the debate, shifting it from a
question of regional public good to a narrower sense of quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   "It became highly emotional, and everything got dragged into that
black hole," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The looming death of an El Toro airport could lay the groundwork for
political progress, Buffa said, allowing both sides to move beyond their
incendiary differences and forge a common vision.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a great opportunity for people on both sides to stop and take a
breath and come to the table; not to hash over what's happened in the
past but to say, 'What do we do next?' " he said. "That's going to be
hard, but in a lot of ways, it's a huge opportunity."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No more waiting. It's finally over. March 10 came and went and we can
get back to life without those incessant promos for "A Season on the
Brink."</LD>
<LD>   Oh yeah, it's also time to fill out those brackets.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA tournament seemed less important to ESPN than the debut
of its Bob Knight movie. And CBS thought a lame feature on coaches'
thoughts about the new geographical seedings was worth showing before
the full tournament field. Here's all sports fans cared about the
last 48 hours: brackets.</LD>
<TE>   Since everything else seemed to come with a lengthy delay Sunday,
we'll get to the goods. Final Four prediction: Duke, Maryland,
Cincinnati, Mississippi State.</TE>
<TE>   Local motion: I'd like USC's chances to get back to the Elite
Eight a lot better if Duke didn't loom as a potential opponent in the
regional semifinals. And Pepperdine has a better chance to reach the
Sweet 16 than UCLA. It's time for scaled-back expectations at UCLA.
Lasting longer than the drawn-out tournament selection show would be
a nice goal.</TE>
<TE>   As the appointed hour dawned, CBS got right to the top seeds,
which might have been the least suspenseful bit of data on the day.
Then they kept us on hold for another 10 minutes, through that
coaches feature and a commercial break. As Kansas Coach Roy Williams
said later on the program: "I was ready to take a nap. I didn't think
we were going to find out the brackets until midnight."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA got stuck in the toughest regional. The West features the
champions of Conference USA (Cincinnati), the Big 12 (Oklahoma), the
Big Ten (Ohio State), the Pacific 10 (Arizona) and a justifiably
heated Gonzaga team (the West Coast champions, who deserved better
than a No. 6 seeding).</TE>
<TE>   If the eighth-seeded Bruins get past No. 9-seeded Mississippi,
they'll almost certainly face Cincinnati in the second round. See ya.
USC has less to fear in Indiana, its possible second-round date.
Under Mike Davis, there's more class to the Hoosier program (can you
imagine Bob Knight hugging Luke Recker the way Davis did Saturday?)
but it still features the same team-oriented style. The reason that
style doesn't work in the tournament anymore (try no trips past the
second round since 1994) is because it's more about the players than
the system, and when you need great players to carry the team in
March they can't do it. Jared Jeffries' disappearance against Iowa in
the Big Ten semifinals reminded me of the way Pepperdine took out
A.J. Guyton two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   USC will be better off for losing to Arizona in the Pac-10
championship game. The Trojans had to be feeling invincible after the
way they handled Stanford and Oregon and put it to the Wildcats in
the first half of Saturday's game. The way they lost the second half
will remind them that they need to pay more attention to protecting
the ball and less attention to the officials. Expect Coach Henry
Bibby to have his team well prepared and to make the right judgment
calls. Who will be the guy for USC? Desmon Farmer? Jerry Dupree? Will
senior Brandon Granville make a last stand? It's going to have to be
some surprising star, because opponents will surround Sam Clancy the
way Arizona did Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That's another reason guards make the difference in March. They
already have the ball in their hands, and it's more difficult to
double-team them out on the floor than it is a player in the low
post. And that's why I like Cincinnati. Steve Logan can get his shot
off at almost any time. They need big play from their big men, Donald
Little and Jason Maxiell.</TE>
<TE>   Great guards and size are the best combination for the tournament.
It won't be easy. Oklahoma is the best No. 2 seed in the tournament
(it's not difficult at all to imagine the Sooners beating
Cincinnati).</TE>
<TE>   The West's No. 4 seed, Ohio State, features a miniature version of
Logan in guard Brent Darby. Kansas should cruise to a spot in the
Midwest regional finals, but I'm wary of Williams' history in the
tournament and Jayhawk freshman guard Aaron Miles. Why Mississippi
State? You have to pick at least one surprise team to make the Final
Four, and I like the Bulldogs' combination of athleticism and a
disciplined offense.</TE>
<TE>   What about Oregon, the No. 2 seed? The Ducks are an opportunistic
team, but if Pepperdine knocks off Wake Forest, the Waves should be
able to handle them. After all, they beat USC, which matched up well
with Oregon. Maryland has as complete a package as any team out
there, and the Terrapins have the benefit of playing in the weakest
regional.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland vs. Duke has become the best rivalry in college
basketball for the last couple of seasons. We missed out on another
meeting in the ACC championship, but we'll get to see it happen at
the national title game in Atlanta. Duke was the best team coming
into this season. Four months into it, they're looking like the best
again. As they've wobbled, as Jason Williams' poor free-throw
shooting made them look vulnerable, they needed some sort of
statement to themselves that, "We're still Duke." The ACC tournament
provided that. They will repeat as champions.</TE>
<TE>   We've had all the other distractions and analysis (was it me, or
did every potential at-large team have an RPI ranking of 56?), and
now it's time for one of the purest events in sports. With no more
delays.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: When dozens of big leaguers aged overnight, it
brought to light long-standing issues that needed addressing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels' top up-and-coming pitcher is actually three years older
than the club thought. Turns out, he'll be 29 on March 23 and thus
should be approaching his prime.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta Braves' shortstop wasn't really a teenager when he won
the National League rookie of the year award in 2000. He was actually
21.</LD>
<LD>   And the San Diego Padres' shortstop recently turned 29. Last year,
he was 26.</LD>
<TE>   More than two dozen Latin-born major leaguers--including Angel
pitcher Ramon Ortiz, and shortstops Rafael Furcal of the Braves and
Deivi Cruz of the Padres--have aged virtually overnight amid a
federal government crackdown on immigration documentation in the wake
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, players who might have fudged their ages years ago
trying to attract teams looking to sign young prospects are being
outed by INS agents who will no longer overlook minor
discrepancies--such as conflicting birth dates--in documentation.</TE>
<TE>   "This was something that clearly needed to be addressed," said
Steve Phillips, general manager of the New York Mets. "You want to
have the truth to make informed decisions. I mean, there is a
difference between 22 and 25, and 25 and 28."</TE>
<TE>   Clubs have long struggled to obtain official records to accurately
document the age of players from impoverished countries, but they
accepted the risks as part of doing business in the key
foreign-player market.</TE>
<TE>   Executives say the discrepancies are now raising concerns about
making multi-million-dollar commitments to players who might be much
older than they claim. Moreover, officials believe that this spring's
revelations are only the beginning because there might be as many as
100 minor leaguers with false documentation still under the radar.</TE>
<TE>   "We're becoming more aware of the trend of baseball players to use
false documents ... and we're seeing most of the fraudulent documents
from the Dominican Republic," said Christopher Lamora, a state
department spokesman. "The bottom line is that people, not just
baseball players, will use false documents in the process of applying
for a visa. We catch them, a lot of the time, because their stories
just don't match [their documentation]."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball players in the Dominican Republic are often encouraged to
lie about their age by intermediaries who arrange tryouts with teams.
Once on that slippery road, it's hard for players to change course.</TE>
<TE>   Lamora said that officials from the U.S. embassy in Santo Domingo
have met frequently with representatives of the branch of the
commissioner's office in the Dominican capital, as well as with
teams, stressing that accurate birth information is a prerequisite
for obtaining visas.</TE>
<TE>   But lying is tempting for a player who sees a baseball contract as
a way to raise his family out of third-world poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a totally different socio-economic situation than in our
country," Colorado General Manager Dan O'Dowd said. "They're looking
for a way out, they're looking for an edge, and someone in a
leadership position suggests that that's what they should do. A lot
of these kids don't know any better; they're just taking direction
from people they learn to trust. There has to be personal
accountability as well, but they're in a really difficult situation."</TE>
<TE>   Clubs seek to sign skilled 16-year-olds, the minimum signing age,
hoping to stock farm systems with players who have "high
ceilings"--lots of potential--scouts said.</TE>
<TE>   Players believe the younger they are, the more attractive they are
to scouts, increasing their chances of joining a team and getting a
big signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "The way out of that place for them is to play baseball, and if it
means cutting down their ages to impress a scout, then that's what
they're going to do," said Tom Lasorda, Dodger vice president. "If a
guy is 21, and he tells a scout he's 18, that makes him more in
demand....</TE>
<TE>   "As a scout, when I send you to camp in the United States, the
organization will look at you as a good-looking ballplayer if you're
18. But if you're 22, they may not look at you the same way. Younger
is better."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most recent cases, the Angels discovered earlier
this month that Dominican right-hander Joel Peralta, who saved 23
games at Class-A Cedar Rapids last season, will turn 26 this month,
not 22. Another Dominican right-hander, Hatuey Mendoza, is 23, not
22.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cub pitcher Juan Cruz was revealed to be 23, not 21 as
listed in the team's media guide, when his application for a visa
recently was red-flagged. Said Cruz, "Sometimes you're doing whatever
you have to do, but it's not correct."</TE>
<TE>   With a wink and a nod, baseball officials for years have chuckled
at questions about age, viewing discrepancies as part of the game's
folklore. And this spring most have taken a light-hearted
approach--at least publicly--with players who are aging years at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   When the Padres learned shortstop Cruz was three years older, the
team had a birthday party for him at its Peoria, Ariz., spring
training complex.</TE>
<TE>   "There were three candles on the cake for the three missing years,
and we had a hat for him and everything," General Manager Kevin
Towers said.</TE>
<TE>   Underage signings, secret tryouts and the influence of street
agents, known as buscones, had resulted in a Wild West atmosphere in
the Dominican Republic. The commissioner's office acknowledged as
much on Dec. 5, 2000, when it opened its first Latin American office
in Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   The staff's main assignment was to protect players from being
signed underage. However, the charter has been expanded to include
working with the governments of the U.S. and Dominican Republic to
help resolve age discrepancies in the visa process, and provide teams
with better information.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the past three years the Dodgers have been embroiled in
controversial cases involving Latin American players. In June 1999,
the commissioner's office granted free agency to two Dodger minor
leaguers who accused the team of holding secret tryouts in Cuba and
spiriting them off to the Dominican Republic, where they took up
residence at the Dodger Baseball Academy.</TE>
<TE>   Later the same year, it was revealed that Dodger third baseman
Adrian Beltre had been signed by the club before he had reached
baseball's minimum age of 16. Beltre's Dodger personnel file
contained two birth certificates--one showing he was 15 when he
signed, and another with the year of birth whited out and changed to
a date that would have made his signing legal.</TE>
<TE>   Now, players must present official birth certificates to clubs in
order to sign contracts. Copies of birth certificates are kept on
file at the Santo Domingo office as well as with the clubs players
join.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had an increased effort in the Dominican Republic," said
Pat Courtney of the commissioner's office. "We found that there just
wasn't a good handle on things, and we wanted to have an increased
presence in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Clubs want accurate information because of the dollars involved in
signing bonuses and multiyear contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "From a baseball standpoint, age is a factor," Towers said. "You
talk to any scout or [chief executive officer] about a player, and
the first thing they ask is, 'How old is he?' There are peak times
for pitchers and position players, and history gives us a pretty good
gauge of when they're in their prime and when they [go into decline].
Accurate information is especially important when you're talking
about players in their mid-30s.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think you're signing a guy to a multiyear contract when
he's 31, you might not have the same feeling about doing a deal if
you knew he was really 34 or 35. Not to mention any names, but there
have been some players signed to big deals who broke down really
quickly. Some people wondered how they could lose it so quickly, and
the suspicion was that they were older than people realized they
were. With what the commissioner's office is doing now [in the
Dominican Republic], you at least have some sense of certainty when
you talk to your owner."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dodger General Manager Dan Evans: "If you traded for a player
under the research and guidance that he was two or three years
younger, thinking that he was part of your long-term future, and then
you suddenly found out that he was two, three or four years older, it
would make you think twice about what you gave up. The years of a
player's career being his prime are such that, when you start
advancing his age, you start to have concerns."</TE>
<TE>   But baseball executives said it would be unfair to single out the
Dominican Republic as the only hotbed for age falsification. After
all, legendary pitcher Satchel Paige once mused, "How old would you
be if you didn't know how old you were?"</TE>
<TE>   "We have phases of [media attention] on different parts of the
game, where some things are talked about more at certain times for a
lot of reasons, and this is just the topic of conversation for this
year," Montreal Expo General Manager Omar Minaya said. "Last year, it
could have been the strike zone. Next year, it could be that the
balls are different. This just happens to be caught in the web now.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing about this is that this is nothing new. I can
tell you, as a guy who scouted for many years, we've known that there
are certain parts of [the U.S.] where you don't know how old some
players are. It's just something that scouts run into sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just part of baseball."</TE>

<HD>Talk of Suspension Hangs Over Glaus</HD>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Angels are bracing for possible suspensions that could remove
slugger Troy Glaus from the lineup for several games during the
regular season.</LD>
<LD>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman said Sunday that umpires filed
a report to major league officials about two bench-clearing
brawls--and six ejections--in Saturday's game against the San Diego
Padres.</LD>
<LD>   Stoneman said he was uncertain if disciplinary action would be
taken.</LD>
<TE>   Chicago Cub pitcher Julian Tavarez was suspended for five
regular-season games and San Francisco Giant infielder Russ Davis for
three after a spring training brawl last year. Tavarez struck out
Davis, then made a gesture that prompted him to charge the mound.
Tavares karate-kicked the onrushing Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres' Ryan Klesko charged the mound Saturday, after being
hit by the Angels' Aaron Sele. Klesko was ejected. Glaus later
charged the mound after being hit by the Padres' Bobby Jones. Glaus
and Jones were ejected, along with the Padres' Phil Nevin, the
Angels' Scott Spiezio and San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy.</TE>
<TE>   If there are suspensions, Klesko stands to get the longest one,
since he was ejected after the first fight and returned to the
field--in street clothes--for the second.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, who hit 41 home runs last year and a club-record 47 two
years ago, said he reacted out of instinct and had no time to
consider whether his action might result in a suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "If it does, it does," Glaus said. "I can't change it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Mike Scioscia of possible suspensions: "You've got to
be able to adjust to every situation. Hopefully, it won't come to
that. But it's in the league's hands."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When major league owners promised not to lock players out of
spring training, players did not respond with a no-strike pledge that
could have ensured this season would be completed without
interruption.</TE>
<TE>   The players believe they need to retain the strike option as a
last resort in case owners declare an impasse, a provision of labor
law that allows management to unilaterally implement new work rules
if a collective bargaining agreement cannot be reached. But owners
believe the threat of impasse might be all that forces the players'
union to negotiate rather than stall in an effort to preserve the
current system.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig, asked Sunday whether owners would rule out
impasse as an option, twice declined to directly answer the question,
but said, "We haven't said anything about impasse.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing another year with the same contract," Selig said.
"That isn't a good thing for the clubs, obviously."</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a new labor agreement, the one that expired last
year remains in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Selig said he felt "sadness" upon hearing players had discussed
boycotting the All-Star Game--in Selig's hometown of Milwaukee--if
progress is not made in negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Union chief Donald Fehr said the union has not considered that
option.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel split squads lost to the Oakland Athletics, 4-2, at Tempe
and to the Chicago Cubs, 6-5, at Mesa. At Tempe, outfielder Jeff
DaVanon, slowed by a strained hamstring, made his spring debut and
joined Clay Bellinger and Jose Nieves in the battle for a bench job.
Leadoff hitter David Eckstein, who had two hits, is batting .526 (10
for 19) and has scored nine runs in seven games. At Mesa, outfielder
Orlando Palmeiro, who started the spring 0 for 15, had two hits....
Scioscia said outfielder Tim Salmon, hampered by back stiffness and a
toe infection, should return today.</TE>

<DH>James Blake Didn't Take the Standard Route to Becoming the
Latest U.S. Talent, but He's ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>The most recent frames of James Blake's life have him reaching a
tournament final, receiving a standing ovation during the match,
earning accolades for his sportsmanship and poise under difficult
circumstances, and lastly, modeling Kenneth Cole and DKNY threads in
a glossy magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the earlier frames are more interesting, telling how
Blake got here, a journey that, on many levels, could not have been
more drastic.</LD>
<LD>   * At 13, he wore a back brace; now 22, he has a contract with IMG
Models.</LD>
<TE>   * As a teenager, he entered Harvard with the modest goal of
playing No. 4 singles; now he's ranked 49th in the ATP Entry System.
He reached his first ATP final last month in Memphis, Tenn., losing
to Andy Roddick in three sets. The occasion marked the first time an
African American male made a final since Mal Washington lost at
Wimbledon in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate," Blake said of the gap. "Maybe it's a
generational thing. Mal looked up to Arthur [Ashe], and I looked up
to Mal. Maybe in between there weren't as many people to look up to.
If myself and Levar Harper-Griffith do well, it'll get some kids to
come out and see us be positive role models."</TE>
<TE>   * A self-described "brat," he used to do a pretty decent imitation
of John McEnroe; now he's acting more like another early influence,
Ashe, winning sportsmanship awards and defusing heated situations.</TE>
<TE>   Blake started 2000 by losing his first six matches, but by the
time he finished 2001 he was on the U.S. Davis Cup team. He nearly
defeated eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt at the U.S. Open, losing in
five sets in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what you're going to get," said Brian Barker, who
has coached Blake since he was 11. "He likes a different hairdo or a
different headband that no one else is wearing. I think he likes to
surprise me, likes to surprise everyone."</TE>
<TE>   With the recent combination of Davis Cup and the Memphis final,
finally, there is another American name to put in the same sentence
with Roddick. No longer does Blake's story focus solely upon the
issue of race.</TE>
<TE>   For ATP officials, who hardly were counting on Blake a year ago,
his arrival into prominence after victories against Alex Corretja,
Tommy Haas and Xavier Malisse in 2002 is a marketing godsend.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Roddick are scheduled to make their first appearance
here as the Pacific Life Open men's event starts today with main-draw
play at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Roddick, who is seeded 11th,
may not be able to play because of illness, but if he does, he will
face a qualifier in the first round; Blake, a wild-card entrant,
opens against Jan-Michael Gambill.</TE>
<TE>   The Blake-Gambill match could have larger implications because of
the upcoming Davis Cup quarterfinal against Spain on grass next month
in Houston. Blake, not Gambill, received the call from captain
Patrick McEnroe to play singles in the relegation round against India
in October. Blake won both his singles matches and combined with
Mardy Fish to win the doubles in the first round against Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   Gambill versus Blake could be called a battle of the models. How
often do you get to write that about tennis players not named
Kournikova? Gambill has long had an agreement with the Ford Modeling
Agency, and now Blake has a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Much to his chagrin, Blake has taken some shots from the
off-runway players on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, plenty," Blake said. "I think it's going to be worse in
Miami. I'm being made fun of in the locker room a little bit, just
that this whole tennis thing is not even important, just to get into
bigger and better things. Yeah, right. I don't think I have much
chance of that. I better go work on my forehand."</TE>
<TE>   Blake takes the teasing in stride. After all, he has had plenty of
practice. When he was 13 he was diagnosed with scoliosis, a curvature
of the spine, and he had to wear a brace 18 hours a day to prevent
the condition from worsening. The only time he took it off was to
play tennis. Even now his back hurts on long fights.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very tough," Blake said. "It probably made me more shy in
school because I had a huge plastic brace under my clothes. I was
very restricted in my movement. I'm lucky I haven't had any more
problems."</TE>
<TE>   He chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'd be about two inches taller if I had a straight back,"
he said. "I'd have a little bigger serve."</TE>
<TE>   Blake's rise has taken even his closest associates by surprise.
Barker said his protege did not even qualify for the nationals when
he was 15. Within three years, he won the U.S. National 18s Clay
Courts and got to the final at Kalamazoo.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, his slow development may have helped the U.S. Davis
Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   With all the attention placed upon Taylor Dent and his dual
American and Australian heritage, hardly anyone noticed that Blake's
mother, Betty, is British. But McEnroe put Blake in the Davis Cup
lineup, ending the possibility that the youngster could join Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski.</TE>
<TE>   At the Australian Open, Blake told Henman that his mother is from
Oxfordshire. Henman perked up, according to Blake.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he knew," Blake said. "He said, 'Really, why don't
you play for us?' I think Jose Higueras [of the USTA] was on the
court at the same time, and he said, 'Hey, stay away from our guy.'
They never showed that much interest. I don't think they knew. I love
England, going back there, but I was born and raised here.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have been happy if they had given me a wild card into
Wimbledon, but hopefully I won't need it anymore. Maybe since I'm
half-English, half the crowd will be on my side."</TE>
<TE>   Betty and his father, Tom, were tennis players and brought their
sons along to the courts, which was easier than finding a
baby-sitter. Young James tested their patience as well as Barker's.
Blake said he would hit three balls and start whining, and "going
nuts."</TE>
<TE>   Said Barker: "So many people were on him to behave better. He did
well at a couple of tournaments and no one was that fired up because
he could be a pain in the neck. I think he realized what's the sense
of being good if you're not that popular. Now he still gets angry but
controls it very well."</TE>
<TE>   Blake's older brother, Thomas, chalks it up to maturity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he just got a little bit older and started to feel
ridiculous, like he was the only one out there doing it," Thomas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's college, satellites or the ATP pro tour, Blake
eventually makes the journey.</TE>

<LD>Skip Bayless in the San Jose Mercury News commenting on Charles
Barkley: "He's all Barkley and no bite. [He] is now no more than a
glib Dennis Rodman, willing to say or do just about anything to get
the attention he craves like cheeseburgers.</LD>

he's a frustrated ex-player who was never any more than a superstar
wannabe ...</LD>
<LD>   "Now Barkley, the live-TV lightning rod, is no more than an

are often laughing at--instead of with--him. He's even funnier

<TE>   Trivia time: When did the USC men's team first participate in the
NCAA basketball tournament?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A true artist: Rick Anderson of the Arizona Wildcats commenting to
Bruce Pascoe of the Arizona Daily Star on teammate Luke Walton's
contribution in assists and scoring in the 81-71 victory over USC in
the Pacific 10 tournament final on Saturday: "[Walton] is like a
painter or a Liberace or something like that. The guy can just
create."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A minor ouchie: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"David Justice, slight hamstring pull. In baseballese, Justice
tweaked a hammie. Sounds almost like a fun injury, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   "'What did you do over the weekend?' Went up to the lake, drank
some beer, did some fishin', tweaked a hammie.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "Golf according to [John] Daly: Grip it and rip it.
Golf according to Sergio Garcia: Grip it and grip it and grip it and
grip it ... "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baseball dilemma: San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker in an
interview with Art Spander of the Oakland Tribune: "When you're
managing, you're at the mercy of your players. You can do everything
right and it doesn't work out, or you can do everything wrong and
your players get you out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you make decisions and they don't work, it doesn't mean they
were wrong."</TE>

<TE>   Wow! How revealing: In an article in Esquire magazine, Milwaukee
Buck Coach George Karl reveals that he never wears underwear while
coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Did we have to know that?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1978, UCLA defeated Kansas, 83-78, in
a first-round NCAA West regional game in Eugene, Ore. The Bruins then
lost to Arkansas, 74-70, on March 16 in a regional semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: 1940. The Trojans defeated Colorado, 38-32, in a
first-round game before losing to Kansas, 43-42, in a national
semifinal at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Shaquille O'Neal told Norm Clarke of the Las Vegas
Review-Journal that he was about to close a deal to buy the home of
teammate Brian Shaw in Las Vegas, saying it was "being a good
businessman."</TE>
<TE>   His rationale? He told Clarke he usually spends about $200,000 on
a trip to Las Vegas, including $10,000 for a private plane to bring
in his pals, $50,000-$60,000 for hotel rooms and another
$50,000-$60,000 gambling.</TE>
<TE>   Having a home there will reduce his overhead significantly.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Take Step in Right Direction</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They move within 21/2 games of final
playoff spot in West with 95-78 victory over Cavaliers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>The Clippers took care of business Sunday afternoon against the
overmatched Cleveland Cavaliers, winning their fifth in six games,
their seventh in the last 11 and topping last season's total with
their 32nd victory in their 63rd game.</LD>
<LD>   And get this, they actually gained ground in their desperate
playoff chase.</LD>
<LD>   While the Clippers were beating the Cavaliers, 95-78, before a
muted crowd of 12,283 at Gund Arena, the Houston Rockets were
defeating the Utah Jazz on Steve Francis' last-second three-point
basket.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, the ninth-place Clippers are 21/2 games behind the Jazz
for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot and four
behind the seventh-place Seattle SuperSonics. The Portland Trail
Blazers are in sixth place and lead the Clippers by six games.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have two games apiece against the Jazz and
SuperSonics. They do not face the Trail Blazers again.</TE>
<TE>   If the Clippers remain in the playoff hunt, the final 19 games are
only going to gain in significance. The Clippers also are about to
become fans of the teams facing Utah, Seattle and Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, it meant pulling for the Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve Francis is my man," Clipper point guard Jeff McInnis said
upon learning of Houston's victory over the Jazz. "I've got to page
[Houston's] Moochie Norris right now and say, 'Thank you.' I heard
some of the guys shouting Steve Francis' name over there by the TV."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis was among several contributors to the Clippers' easy
victory, scoring 10 points and adding nine assists and eight
rebounds. Seven Clippers scored 10 or more points, led by Elton Brand
and Eric Piatkowski, who each had 17.</TE>
<TE>   Next stop: Minneapolis, where the Clippers end a long and
circuitous trip with a game tonight against the Minnesota
Timberwolves. It's the final game in a string of 25 of 35 away from
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going there to win," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "You can't be
satisfied. Hey, we play in the West. We've got to step out on the
court with the intention of winning every game now."</TE>
<TE>   There are people within the Clipper organization quietly amazed
the team has progressed this far without the services of injured
small forwards Lamar Odom and Corey Maggette. For obvious reasons,
those people wish to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   But their point is well taken.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have moved into the thick of the race without their
most versatile player in Odom and perhaps their best defender in
Maggette for extended periods. Plus, backup point guard Keyon Dooling
has been sidelined by a sprained left ankle for most of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Having other guys step up is very satisfying," Gentry said when
asked about excelling without Odom, Maggette and Dooling. "I think
what you've seen so far is that we're headed in the right
direction.... We're probably going to have to have some help in some
directions because of the way Portland, Seattle and Utah are going
right now.</TE>
<TE>   "And Phoenix is right behind us. It's probably going to come down
to the last week of the season. But the only way to stay in the race
is to keep winning."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving nothing to chance, the Clippers hammered away at the
Cavaliers' numerous weaknesses Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, taking advantage of the absence of Cleveland forward
Tyrone Hill because of a concussion and center Chris Mihm because of
a sore knee, outrebounded the Cavaliers, 59-34. Brand had 14 rebounds
to go with his 17 points, his 43rd double-double.</TE>
<TE>   And there was more.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the Clippers limited Cleveland point guard Andre
Miller, holding him to six points and 10 assists one game after he
had 31 points and 11 assists while playing all 53 minutes of Friday's
overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "We just tried to pressure Andre Miller and make him take tough
shots," McInnis said. "I have DirecTV and I know he's going to go 48
minutes in a lot of games. I wanted to get up on him and make him get
tired a little bit. We knew Miller was the key to anything they
wanted to do. If we could slow him down, we'd have a good chance to
win."</TE>
<TE>   Brand's hook shot gave the Clippers an 18-16 lead late in the
first quarter and they never trailed again, leading, 26-20, after one
quarter and 46-38 by halftime. Midway through the fourth, their lead
would swell to 26 points.</TE>
<TE>   With the game in hand, Gentry benched his starters. McInnis, well
aware that he was close to a triple-double, did not resist after
telling Gentry, "But coach, I need two rebounds and an assist for a
triple-double."</TE>
<TE>   Later, McInnis would tell reporters, "I know I've got to chase
[Minnesota point guard] Chauncey Billups around [tonight]. I need my
legs under me. I'd gladly take the win anytime over a triple-double.
We've got to be ready to go right at them [the Timberwolves]. We know
they're going to be ready for us. That's the way it is now when the
Clippers come to town."</TE>
<TE>   When the Clippers last faced Minnesota, it was at the end of a
six-game trip and the Timberwolves won, 97-83. This time, the
Clippers are at the end of a four-game trip, having won two in a row
and four of five away from Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're jelling as a team," McInnis said. "We're gaining
confidence."</TE>

<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Since their heart-to-heart meeting Jan. 29, point guard Jeff McInnis
and Coach Alvin Gentry have grown closer. It's no secret that theirs
was a strained relationship until their talk.</LD>
<LD>   "It was one of those deals where he had to understand where I'm
coming from and I had to understand where he's coming from," Gentry
said. "I have to count on him and I can't if he's going to be an
emotional powder keg."</LD>
<LD>   McInnis, who admits to being a fiery player, has mostly kept his
emotions in check since Gentry benched him for barking at referees
rather than running down court to play defense in a Jan. 28 loss
against the Memphis Grizzlies.</LD>
<TE>   "Players have to adjust to coaches, but coaches have to adjust to
players too," Gentry said. "I have a better understanding of where
he's coming from."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry would like to see McInnis, a free agent after the season,
back next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see our whole team back," he said. "I think we're
building something here. We need consistency in our personnel, in our
core group of six or seven guys. We can't keep running in different
players every year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clipper guard Earl Boykins, a Cleveland native, had about 100
family and friends in attendance Sunday. They did not go away
disappointed. Boykins made a terrific reverse layup and a short jump
shot to highlight his 10 minutes of play.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown Speeding Back; Ashby Has Slower Going</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>One Dodger comeback soared over another hurdle like Edwin Moses
Sunday, but the other stumbled in the starting blocks.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Brown, who underwent surgery to repair the flexor tendon in
his elbow last September, struck out six of the eight batters he
faced in his first Grapefruit League start, a two-inning stint in the
Dodgers' 5-2 loss to Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Ashby, who had the same surgery as Brown last June, struggled
in his second exhibition appearance, giving up four runs and five
hits in the third inning after retiring the first two batters. Ashby
felt no ill effects from throwing 33 pitches in the third, but the
manner in which he gave up four runs made him queasy.</LD>
<TE>   There was an 0-1 hanging curve that Chris Truby smacked for a home
run, a walk to Richard Hidalgo after getting ahead in the count 1-2,
and a run-scoring single to Keith Ginter on an 0-2 pitch. So
frustrated was Ashby that he used some form of the word "frustrated"
11 times in a six-minute interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I've waited this long to pitch, I don't want to go out there and
stink it up," said Ashby, who threw a scoreless fourth. "You don't
want to give up four runs with two outs. It's frustrating to get
ahead and then overthrow a pitch when you're trying to bury a guy. If
that stuff happens during the season, it's going to cost you games."</TE>
<TE>   It's probably a sign of progress that Ashby is talking more about
his pitching than his elbow. His arm feels good, and he's happy about
that, but Ashby knows he won't be a feel-good story if he keeps
pitching the way he did Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to give up runs, but stupid runs are totally
different," Ashby said. "Giving up 0-2 hits, two-out walks ... it's
frustrating.... I've been pitching long enough to know what I have to
do. I'm overthrowing the ball, and that has to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Jim Colborn thought Ashby was too hard on himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The ability to make out pitches is way beyond what his
expectations should be right now," Colborn said. "I felt he was
getting impatient. Maybe he thought he'd have surgery, rehab and step
in and be a pitcher again. He may have forgotten that long, hard
process of preparing, and this is going to remind him of it."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby had a tough act to follow. Brown was dominant, showing
excellent command except for one fastball that hit Hidalgo. He threw
16 pitches, 11 for strikes, in each inning. Only one batter, Julio
Lugo, put the ball in play. He had a second-inning single. Brown's
fastball was clocked from 87 to 92 mph, and he threw some nice
off-speed pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have saved those for the real season," Brown said of the
strikeouts. "It's great to get guys out, but if I was giving up hits,
it's still progress. Just getting out there and throwing is clearing
another hurdle."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy plans to start Brown on opening day, April 2,
against San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a total focus on going out and getting hitters out," Tracy
said of Brown. "I didn't see any reservations, any holding back. He's
just a different breed of cat."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, though, seems to have a few reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think each time out he's trying to convince himself that
he's physically OK," Tracy said. "He's getting to the point where
he's about to jump over that hurdle, but he's still not there. The
only way to solve it is with more trips to the mound."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had three hits Sunday, but Tracy was impressed with
leadoff batter Dave Roberts, who walked in the first inning, stole
second, took third on Jeff Reboulet's grounder and scored on Brian
Jordan's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   It marked the second time this spring Roberts walked to open a
game and scored. That happened only once last season, when Tom
Goodwin walked to open a Sept. 26 game against the Giants and scored.
Roberts walked and had a bunt single in his two other plate
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Omar Daal rebounded from two shaky spring outings to
throw three scoreless innings Sunday, giving up one hit and striking
out four....Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, sidelined by a sore
right hamstring, will test the leg by running the bases today. If
that goes well, he could make his first exhibition appearance in the
next few days.</TE>

<KH>SECOND THOUGHTS</KH>
<HD>This Bracket Formula Zigs, but Sure Doesn't Zag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News, notes, musings and commentary while trying to figure out what
the (insert applicable Bob Knight cuss word here) the NCAA tournament
selection committee did to Gonzaga and my printable bracket ...</LD>
<LD>   News item: NCAA tournament pairings are released.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: It's tough to get a bracketologist to make house
calls on a Sunday, yet I somehow snagged a guy who was able to adjust
my sacroiliac and explain how the new first-round formula works.</LD>
<TE>   The idea, he said, was to make travel easier for teams in the
early rounds, so that's why Pepperdine can be in the Midwest Regional
and USC in the South yet both schools can have opening-round games in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is no explaining what happened to Gonzaga. Not only
did the Bulldogs get a lousy No. 6 seeding in the jerky-tough West
Regional, the Zags even got shipped to Albuquerque, by far the
toughest opening-round site to spell.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, selection committee chairman Lee Fowler scratched his
head and told CBS that Gonzaga "is not an easy team to seed."</TE>
<TE>   Well, sure it is. Gonzaga, which has more than earned its NCAA
chops, won the West Coast Conference, is No. 20 in the latest RPI and
is infinitely more qualified to be a No. 3 than Georgia, which
checked out of the Southeastern Conference tournament so fast players
forgot to pick up their free watches.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA geniuses, Part II. In its Herculean effort to save the NCAA a
few bucks on travel expenses (you know that $2 billion CBS is paying
only goes so far), the committee ended up with tilted brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Duke has a relative duck-walk through the South while the West is
a basketball booby trap, with four conference tournament
champions--Cincinnati, Oklahoma, Arizona and Ohio State--loaded on
one side of the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Also, note to commissioners. Playing conference title games Sunday
is about as important as the old NCAA third-place consolation game.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point. Oklahoma, fighting for a No. 1 seeding, upset
top-ranked Kansas in the Big 12 title game but still got stuck with a
No. 2 seed because, we assume, the NCAA committee didn't want to
tinker with its vaunted S-curve so close to the pairings
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland, which lost in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament
semifinals Saturday, easily retained its No. 1 seeding and appears to
have garnered the top spot overall by virtue of getting to open
against Tuesday's "play-in" winner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Kansas is the team to beat in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: So much for trying to get an early jump on this
column. That loss to Oklahoma on Sunday hit me like a truck; imagine
how it hit Kansas Coach Roy Williams.</TE>
<TE>   You hate to think Kansas is about to take another NCAA fall, and
the talented but title-less Williams will leave another tournament in
tears, yet you get the feeling this could be 1997 all over again.</TE>
<TE>   This is clearly Williams' best team since that Jayhawk juggernaut
featuring Jacques Vaughn, Scot Pollard and Raef LaFrentz. Kansas had
won 34 games before getting bounced out in the Southeast Regional
semifinals by Arizona, which finished fifth in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   I'll never forget Williams saying after that loss in Birmingham,
Ala., "I'm going to keep knocking on the door and one of these days,
I'm going to knock the sucker down."</TE>
<TE>   The time has come, Roy, and the door is awaiting your boot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Alcorn State and Siena meet in Tuesday night's
"play-in" game at Dayton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The semantics conscious NCAA insists this is not a
"play-in" game. OK, what else would you call it? If it's a
first-round game, then what game does Tuesday's winner advance to, a
second-round, first-round game?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, "play-in" is a kinder euphemism than some others I had
in mind:</TE>
<TE>   "Loser Goes Home! (Winner goes home Friday)"</TE>
<TE>   Bracket Busters</TE>
<TE>   48 Hours (until real tournament starts)</TE>
<TE>   No Net Gain</TE>
<TE>   We Opted Out of the NIT for This?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Arizona Daily Star reports that downtown Los Angeles
hotel housing Pac-10 officials and players for weekend's conference
tournament did not have cable access to Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: We heard bellhops kept players and officials
abreast of all the tournament action through an intricate system of
secret hand signals and door knocks: Example: it was one knock if Cal
Coach Ben Braun out-coached UCLA's Steve Lavin, two knocks if
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery checked out early. Three knocks? That
was the signal to tune to ESPN for updates.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Nebraska finishes No. 115 in the latest Rating
Percentage Index and does not make the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Incredibly, the Cornhuskers are holding firm at
No. 2 in the latest bowl championship series rankings and think they
are deserving of a Final Four matchup against, perhaps, Miami.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Brian Dennehy stars in profanity-laced performance as
Coach Bob Knight in ESPN's "A Season on the Brink."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Knight's use of the F-word 15 times in one
three-minute snippet breaks the record for a coach/manager set by
former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda after he was asked once to assess
slugger Dave Kingman's performance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: CBS announcer Billy Packer calls the Knight movie "a
piece of garbage."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: In an industry note, ESPN plans to air Packer's
raw and unexpurgated comments about the movie on ESPN while ESPN2
will simulcast a version that has been toned down for family
consumption.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Kobe Bryant says of Reggie Miller, "I don't like him at
all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Bryant reveals other "likes" and "dislikes" on the
upcoming Barbara Walters Special. Likes: soft summer sunsets,
chocolate ice cream, moonlit drives. Dislikes: Miller ("He probably
has a sister who shoots better"), movies with foreign subtitles, NBA
referees with an agenda, Phil Jackson "when he stares at me that
way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: ABC pulls plug on John McEnroe-hosted quiz show, "The
Chair."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The network is retaining rights to the show's
title in the off chance they can work out a quiz-show deal with Bob
Knight.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Get Boxed In</HD>
<DH>Hockey: A costly penalty and one shot in third period help
bring down Anaheim in 4-2 loss to Ottawa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Friesen knew the immediate future, just as sure as he knew he
should have skated away from Ottawa's Shane Hnidy.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't need to be chewed out by Mighty Duck Coach Bryan Murray
before the third period--although he was--to understand what was
about to happen.</LD>
<LD>   Friesen could only watch from the penalty box as Ottawa's Daniel
Alfredsson buried a shot from the blue line, sending the Senators on
their way to a 4-2 victory at the Arrowhead Pond on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Alfredsson's power-play goal, his second of the game, 47 seconds
into the period broke a 2-2 tie. With only one shot in the third
period, the Ducks were never close to getting that goal back. Marian
Hossa flipped in an empty-goal late in the period, sending the
announced crowd of 12,358 to the exits.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks rallied from a 2-0 deficit and had the Senators
backpedaling, as the second period ended in a 2-2 tie. Then Friesen's
and Hnidy got tangled up after the horn. Friesen was called for high
sticking.</TE>
<TE>   "I let my emotion take over and took a dumb penalty," Friesen
said. "I knew what was going to happen. The coaches weren't happy, I
knew I was going to get chewed out coming into the [dressing] room. I
could just feel it, they we're going to score. That's just the way it
has gone for me. Nothing really went as planned. It's been a
disappointing season."</TE>
<TE>   Friesen, one of two players acquired for Teemu Selanne, has had
difficult moments this season. He has decent numbers, 14 goals and 38
points, but has missed on just as many, maybe more, opportunities,
including sliding a shot wide of an open net in the first period
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I feel I'm getting better as a player, but it is one
of those years where you shake your head," Friesen said. "There were
such high expectations. I just haven't been able to live up to them.
That was another example tonight."</TE>
<TE>   This night had a twist ... the penalty. The teams were skating
four-on-four, as the Ducks' Oleg Tverdovsky and Ottawa enforcer Chris
Neil were already in the penalty box for roughing.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, though, lessened the blow and removed some of the blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say it, but there were a couple of calls in this game
that cost us," Murray said. "They were really borderline calls and
Ottawa took advantage of them. The call on Jeff, the two were
pushing, the stick came up a little bit, but it's a nothing call.
We're playing four-on-four and it's a 2-2 game. [The refs] know the
impact of that.</TE>
<TE>   "The other part is we put ourselves in the position to have
questionable calls. Jeff doesn't have to do that. Oleg doesn't have
to fight Chris Neil. I said to him, 'You don't trade yourself for
him. That's his role.' Those are the things we have to get better
at."</TE>
<TE>   The power play falls into that category as well.</TE>
<TE>   The only good thing that can be said about the Duck power play is
that it can't get any worse. They already rank last in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   On their first power play Sunday, the Ducks' Jason York hit the
post and Paul Kariya sent a shot off the crossbar. That can be
considered a successful power play for a team that has only five
goals in their last 46 chances.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ducks got an eyeful of the type of player they need to
change that: Alfredsson, who is fourth in the NHL with 33 goals. He
scored his first power-play goal to give the Senators a 2-0 lead
midway through the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Goals in the second period by German Titov and Denny Lambert got
the Ducks even. But Alfredsson's second goal put the Senators in a
comfortable position, satisfied to just deny the Ducks chances the
final 19 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Pavel Trnka let a slap shot fly from the blue
line with 3 minutes 15 seconds left in the third period Sunday.
Ottawa goalie Patrick Lalime easily got a leg pad on the puck and
deflected it away.</LD>
<LD>   So went the Ducks' best shot on goal in the third period. So went
their only shot on goal in the third period.</LD>
<LD>   The Ottawa Senators took a 3-2 lead 47 seconds into the third
period, then were content to just smother the Ducks. The one shot
tied the Ducks' record for the fewest in a third period. They went
without a shot in the first period against Dallas on Dec. 27, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "[Ottawa] is the best in the league when they get ahead in the
third period," Duck Coach Bryan Murray said. "They trap very well.
You have to make a perfect play."</TE>
<TE>   Which was beyond the Ducks' capability Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time they got in trouble, they iced the puck," Duck center
Andy McDonald said. "Then we would have to start over."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McDonald, who missed the three previous games with a concussion,
returned to the lineup Sunday and seemed to be up to speed.</TE>
<TE>   "Late in the game, he was the one guy in front of the net," Murray
said. "He seemed to come out fine."</TE>
<TE>   His playing time was limited during the first two periods, but he
assisted on Denny Lambert's second-period goal. McDonald out-raced
Ottawa defenseman Zdeno Chara to the puck in the corner then turned
and fired a pass to Lambert, who scored his second goal of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt pretty good out there," McDonald said. "This was the big
test. I started skating Thursday, but I needed to see how I would
react in a game. It was tough, but there were no problems."</TE>

<HD>Kuchar Gets the Message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Kuchar reached into his left pants pocket, pulled out a small
piece of white paper and read the phone message from Greg Norman.</LD>
<LD>   "Congratulations. It's about bloody time. Welcome to the club,"
Norman said.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing could have been more precise.</LD>
<TE>   Kuchar, the 1997 U.S. Amateur champion who turned down millions in
favor of graduating from Georgia Tech, earned his first PGA Tour
victory Sunday at Coral Springs, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The 23-year-old Floridian shot a 6-under-par 66 in the final round
of the Honda Classic to finish two strokes ahead of Brad Faxon (67)
and Joey Sindelar (70).</TE>
<TE>   "What a great feeling, to come out on top, to play all week and to
come out as the champion," Kuchar said. "It has not happened to me a
whole lot, so the times it does, it's outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   Kuchar finished at 19-under 269 and earned $630,000 in his 17th
event as a professional.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure it would happen as soon as it did," Kuchar said. "I
knew it would happen. I always dreamed and knew that I would win and
that I would win a lot, but I wasn't sure that it would happen this
soon."</TE>
<TE>   He had eight birdies and two bogeys in his final round, including
four consecutive birdies on the back nine to help him rally from a
four-shot deficit to Sindelar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a big day for him," said Sindelar, a 43-year-old
pro who made only one bogey in the tournament but remained winless on
tour since 1990. "It's going to change his golf life."</TE>
<TE>   Kuchar needed only 23 putts, including eight over the final eight
holes, to get the victory. He gained a share of the lead with a
12-foot birdie putt on the par-four No. 13, then grabbed the outright
lead with a birdie on the par-five No. 14--his fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchar extended the lead to two strokes with another birdie on the
par-five 16th, and made sure no one could tie him with a 12-foot par
putt on the tough, par-four 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els, the world's third-ranked golfer, won a big tournament
for the second week in a row, shooting a 3-under-par 69 in the final
round to wrap up a four-stroke victory at 272 in the $1.42 million
Desert Classic at Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   The South African star used remarkable consistency to beat Niclas
Fasth of Sweden and win the $250,000 first prize. All four rounds for
Els were below 70 as he added the Dubai to last week's victory in the
Genuity Championship on the Doral course in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   In his last seven starts, Els has won three times on three
continents. He started with a victory in the Heineken Classic in
Melbourne, Australia, last month.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Carl Pettersson of Sweden finished third at 11-under 277.</TE>

<HD>Repent Stays on Course for His Place in History</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: A close victory in Louisiana Derby gives him
chance to complete rare double at Kentucky Derby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only two horses--Black Gold in 1924 and Grindstone in 1996--won the
Louisiana Derby and then captured the Kentucky Derby. Repent is one
race away from becoming the third.</LD>
<LD>   Lugging in badly through the 1,346-foot stretch at the Fair
Grounds and thoroughly testing his new rider, Jerry Bailey, Repent
was a nose better than Easyfromthegitgo on Sunday in the $750,000
Louisiana Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Ken McPeek, who has another Kentucky Derby contender in
Harlan's Holiday, one of the favorites for next Saturday's Florida
Derby, would appear to have three options with Repent--the Arkansas
Derby at Oaklawn Park, the Blue Grass at Keeneland and the Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct. All three will be run on April 13, three weeks
before the Kentucky Derby on May 4.</LD>
<TE>   The Louisiana Derby capped a big weekend for the McPeek outfit in
New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, his brilliant filly, Take Charge Lady, won the
$350,000 Fair Grounds Oaks under Tony D'Amico, the jockey McPeek
dropped in favor of the Derby-seasoned Bailey aboard Repent. A likely
scenario for Take Charge Lady is the Ashland at Keeneland on April 6
and the Kentucky Oaks for 3-year-old fillies at Churchill Downs on
May 3, but McPeek hasn't ruled out running against colts. Take Charge
Lady will also be kept eligible for the Arkansas Derby and the
Illinois Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Repent was next to last heading down the backstretch of Sunday's
11/16-mile race. Bailey attacked from the outside, but his mount kept
bearing in during the final sixteenth of a mile, even though Bailey
switched whip hands from the right to the left.</TE>
<TE>   Easyfromthegitgo, running on the inside, didn't give up and almost
reversed the outcome on Feb. 17, when he finished third to Repent in
the Risen Star Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   After not switching lead feet--which shifts a horse's weight--in
the stretch of the Risen Star, Repent was late switching leads
Sunday, and that's a concern for Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to switch to his right lead sooner," Bailey said,
"because running on the left lead won't cut it at Churchill Downs. It
takes some horses longer than others to learn this, but the time for
this horse to learn it is now."</TE>
<TE>   It'sallinthechase finished third, beaten by 23/4 lengths.
Publication, the Bay Meadows shipper who hadn't run since a
fifth-place finish in the Hollywood Futurity in December, was the
last of seven horses. French Assault was scratched after coming down
with a virus.</TE>
<TE>   Repent, earning $450,000, was timed in 1:434/5 and paid $2.80.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Azeri broke her maiden by winning at Santa Anita last
November, it came only a few days before she was scheduled to be sold
at a Keeneland auction.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of winding up on a Tex Sutton flight to Kentucky, she won
by six lengths and stayed with me," trainer Laura De Seroux said. "We
pulled her out of the sale."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the 4-year-old filly has been almost perfect, and
there was more cause for hoopla Sunday when she beat Spain by three
lengths to win the $300,000 Santa Margarita Handicap for her fourth
win in five starts.</TE>
<TE>   "She should be undefeated," said De Seroux, who trains Azeri for
Michael Paulson and the trust of the late Allen Paulson. "The last
race [a second-place finish to Summer Colony in the La Canada on Feb.
9], she had too much to do. She was too far out of it early."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Santa Margarita, Michael Paulson told Mike Smith,
Azeri's jockey, to ride the filly "like Jerry Bailey rode Cigar." The
reference was to the horse that won horse-of-the-year titles in
1995-96 for Paulson's father.</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, who went off the second choice to Printemps in the betting,
loomed in fourth place after a half-mile, but she was only two
lengths from the lead as Favorite Funtime and Spain battled up front.
The issue was down to Azeri and Spain in the stretch, with Azeri
putting away her rival in the final sixteenth of a mile. Printemps
finished third, beaten by four lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "She got away a lot better this time," Smith said. "The last race
a lot of people didn't realize that she fell in behind, and really
rapped herself. She was like a washing machine that gets unbalanced,
and it took about an eighth of a mile to get her straightened out.
She still got away a little funky today, but at least she didn't hit
herself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yougottawanna and Danthebluegrassman, separated by three-quarters
of a length Saturday in the El Camino Real Derby at Golden Gate
Fields, are both headed for the Santa Anita Derby on April 6.</TE>
<TE>   David Flores, who rode Danthebluegrassman, dropped his whip at the
top of the stretch and improvised by hitting the colt with his
goggles the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it made a big difference," said Bob Baffert, who trains
Danthebluegrassman. "They were running on a hot pace, and my horse is
pretty lazy, so having the whip to urge him on when it counted would
have made a difference."</TE>

<LD>Steve Heinze was tied for the club lead with Adam Deadmarsh when he
scored his 15th goal in a 2-0 victory over the Nashville Predators on
Jan. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, Deadmarsh has scored 10 goals, Heinze none.</LD>
<LD>   Heinze's drought reached 18 games Saturday at Denver when the
right wing failed to score in the Kings' 4-3 loss to the Colorado
Avalanche. Two nights earlier, Heinze had been scratched at
Nashville.</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah, I was surprised," Heinze said of his benching. "But the
team brought me in here over the summer to score goals and that's
something I haven't done in too long of a time, so it's the coach's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with it, but I'm not going to argue with it because
he can just look at the stat sheet and say I haven't been doing the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray, explaining the move, said he thought Heinze
might be pressing and wanted to give him a "mental break" by sitting
him down.</TE>
<TE>   "I think watching the game helps," said Heinze, who signed a
three-year, $6-million contract in July after scoring a career-high
26 goals last season for the Columbus Blue Jackets and Buffalo
Sabres. "You sit up there in the press box and it looks so simple.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you just turn off your brain and be like, 'Hey, look how
easy it is out there; don't make it so hard.' Sometimes you think too
much and make it difficult."</TE>

<TE>   Kelly Buchberger's streak of 243 consecutive games, the NHL's
fourth-longest active ironman streak, will end tonight when the
veteran winger sits out against the Chicago Blackhawks after

<LD>With slightly more than five weeks left in the regular season, the
Lakers are less adamant about resting Shaquille O'Neal's troublesome
big toe before the playoffs. Coach Phil Jackson also said that when
the time for the decision comes, he is as likely to gauge the teams
behind the Lakers in the West as those ahead of them.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have lost one more game than the Pacific Division- and
conference-leading Sacramento Kings have, and have two games
remaining against them.</LD>
<LD>   Though Vlade Divac, who rivals Patrick Ewing in the field of cheap
predictions, said the Lakers would require home-court advantage to
get past the Kings, Jackson implied that Games 1 and 2 in Sacramento
do not frighten him. The Lakers won twice in Sacramento in last
season's playoffs, but those were Games 3 and 4, by which time the
Kings appeared to have lost their zeal for the series.</LD>
<TE>   "One to five is not a very big slide in this conference," Jackson
said. "You want home-court for [at least] a couple rounds."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Jackson would love to see O'Neal shed some girth
and regain mobility in the next 21 games, and keeping him on the
court might be the best way--or the only way--to do that. O'Neal's
arthritic big toe limits his practice time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his conditioning is better," Jackson said. "Obviously,
we've got to get him to lose some weight ... simply because of the
stress on his toe."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are points best made without a cruelty factor, a notion that
struck Jackson on Friday morning, not long into a lesson about
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Perturbed by the two dozen lapses in judgment, motor skills and
conscience in an eight-point loss in Utah, Jackson planned to rub the
Laker noses in every single one.</TE>
<TE>   "I made up a video of all 24 turnovers and subsequently how they
scored 30-something points off [them]," he said Sunday. "But, after
reconsidering the vindictive nature of my character flaw, I rescinded
after showing them the first couple."</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Is Ready for His Close-Up</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Center's short game, rounding into playoff
form, produces 40 points and trumps Knicks' jumpers in 117-103 Laker
win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal generally does what he wants, which is why there
will be few of his observations in today's newspaper, as he slipped
out the back of Staples Center sometime between beating the New York
Knicks and being forced to talk about it.</LD>
<LD>   He scored 40 points, stopped to tell NBC's Jim Gray that he's
"focusing on another three" rings before Phil Jackson's contract
expires and that he won't worry about his teammates "when playoff
time comes," and then took the first thing smoking back to his
Beverly Hills lair.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers won, 117-103, Sunday afternoon, primarily because the
Knicks could not jump shoot with O'Neal's layups, dunks and hooks, at
least not for an entire 48 minutes. O'Neal made 15 of 21 field-goal
attempts, only one from beyond six feet. It was his fifth consecutive
game of exactly 21 attempts. He has scored 40 points in two of three
games, the first coming Tuesday against the New Jersey Nets, proving
again that he kills teams that play within aroma distance of the
Hudson River.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the Lakers have won eight of 10 games, and remain one
loss behind the Sacramento Kings, leaders of the Pacific Division and
Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very optimistic about the way he has been playing the past
couple weeks," Jackson said. "He is showing his most-valuable-player
status in this league."</TE>
<TE>   It is a familiar trend, one O'Neal followed last season, when he
plodded through so much of the regular season because of a sore foot,
pounded through the last of it, and then watched the league's MVP
award fall to Allen Iverson. A year later, he has an achy big toe and
an attitude, and appears to be resigned to grinding through both.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he believed O'Neal were feeling better or simply ignoring
a malady some assume will require postseason surgery, Laker guard
Derek Fisher said, "I think he's fighting it more, taking himself
through what he has to take himself through."</TE>
<TE>   It was enough to discourage the Knicks, one of those
ever-dangerous last-place teams at Staples, if only barely. The
Lakers outscored the Knicks by 32 points in the paint, enough to
overcome the Knick shooters, who made 63.6% of their attempts in the
first quarter and 53.3% in the second.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, Jackson took O'Neal off the active and
perimeter-minded Kurt Thomas, who scored 16 points in the first half,
and put Robert Horry on him. Thomas fouled out with 2:02 left in the
game, and to the bench he took four second-half points.</TE>
<TE>   Horry started again for Samaki Walker, who is on the injured list
with a bum elbow, and brought the typically eclectic line: eight
points, 13 rebounds, four steals, three blocks and two devastating
fourth-quarter three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just being in the right place at the right time," said
Horry, who was kneed hard in the left thigh by Thomas in the final
quarter but played on. "That's how it is. Some games it'll be like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Devean George scored 17 points, which matched his career high.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers kept the Knicks to 43 second-half points, and they led
by at least eight through the fourth quarter, and so lived through a
spirited game by Latrell Sprewell, who scored 31 points, most over
and around Kobe Bryant. Bryant, who has a sore left thumb, took 14
shots, made seven, and had 18 points and seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   "It bothers me a little when I pick up a basketball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that ...</TE>
<TE>   One of the league's moribund franchises, the Knicks scored 12
points more than their season average and still lost for the 13th
time when they've held a double-digit lead. Eleven of the
come-from-way-ahead defeats have come in the Don Chaney era, now 42
games, 29 losses and one contract extension old.</TE>
<TE>   The former Laker assistant had no answer for O'Neal, a conundrum
that places him squarely with 27 other NBA coaches. He tried Thomas
and Felton Spencer, but the Knicks were slow to double-team and
O'Neal did what he does, as he likes to say, when he stays around
long enough to say it. He has averaged 31.7 points in the last 11
games, leading the Lakers in scoring in the last nine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible," Chaney said. "A couple times we even tried to
foul him and he went up and scored. He's just so massive in there,
you can't front him because they'll throw it over the top, and if you
play behind him you can't stop him.... You're at his mercy."</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, is the point. And when O'Neal has that sense
about him, when his hand is high and his eyes beg for the basketball,
the Lakers flood the joint with entry passes and stand back.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's doing that, you look for him to score every time and
maybe sneak in for offensive boards in case he misses," Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has made 70 percent of his field-goal attempts in the past
five games, and he's shown life and agility that wasn't there
earlier, when the playoffs were so far away he could barely see them.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been more verbal lately, as far as making sure guys are
ready to play," Fisher said. "He knows how to get through a regular
season. He knows his body. The rest of us don't.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to know that's part of his personality. He knows the
games mean a lot more."</TE>

<HD>Raptors Vanish Against Magic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orlando Magic might not have many stoppers on defense, but it had
no trouble against the struggling Toronto Raptors.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy McGrady had 22 points, and Orlando held Toronto to 14
fourth-quarter points en route to a 92-79 victory Sunday at Orlando,
Fla. It was the Raptors' 14th loss in 15 games.</LD>
<LD>   "Every single player on the [court] gave everything, and they gave
it on the defensive end, which is impressive," Orlando Coach Doc
Rivers said.</LD>
<TE>   Orlando, among the league's worst defensive teams, hadn't given up
fewer points since beating Detroit, 87-78, on Dec. 28. The Magic held
Toronto to 37.6% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic's defense compensated for a below-average offense.
McGrady, who scored a career-high 50 points against Washington on
Friday, was only seven for 24 from the field and committed six
first-half turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good team win," McGrady said. "A couple of us didn't
shoot the ball extremely well, but defensively, we've turned it up."</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter had 16 points to lead the Raptors. He missed most of
the third quarter after Orlando's Pat Garrity elbowed him in the head
as he shot. Antonio Davis had 15 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto, which couldn't gain any momentum after ending a 13-game
losing streak Friday at Miami, can blame the loss on another
fourth-quarter flameout.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors were held without a field goal for a 7:09 span in the
quarter. Carter missed his five shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to keep executing on offense and keep making it happen,"
Carter said. "We have to will our way to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 95, Utah 92--Steve Francis never had a doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Francis made a three-pointer with one-tenth of a second left to
lift the Rockets at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually looked around to see if anybody was open," Francis
said. "I knew it was in when it left my hand. I just wanted to be
sure there was no time left and I milked it just right."</TE>
<TE>   Utah point guard John Stockton had 13 assists to give him 15,000
in his career. Magic Johnson is second on the league's all-time list
with 10,141.</TE>
<TE>   Francis finished with 16 points. Karl Malone led the Jazz with 21
points and Stockton had 12 points, 10 in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 98, Washington 91--The Celtics are getting a taste of the
postseason with a home-and-home series against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker scored 23 points and Paul Pierce had 18 for the
Celtics at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a mini-playoff," Walker said. "Now we've got to be
ready for their energy level at home."</TE>
<TE>   The teams play tonight at Washington. The Wizards are 2-5 since
Michael Jordan had knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Our security blanket has been Michael," Coach Doug Collins said.
"But we don't have that now, and we just don't have another go-to
guy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 89, Detroit 84--Jermaine O'Neal had 23 points and 14
rebounds to lead the Pacers at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve Corliss Williamson led the Pistons with 22 points. Ben
Wallace tied a Detroit record with five blocked shots in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 88, Phoenix 82--Reserve Jamaal Magloire and Jamal
Mashburn keyed a decisive 20-3 second-period run for the Hornets at
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte built a 22-point lead in the third quarter, then
survived a furious Phoenix rally in ending a three-game losing
streak. The Hornets solidified their hold on the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn led the Hornets with 26 points. Shawn Marion scored 27
for the Suns.</TE>

<HD>Kings Dispose of Roadblock</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Sacramento stops Milwaukee, 98-73, for its
most lopsided road victory this season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Life on the road is getting better for the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Peja Stojakovic scored 21 points and Chris Webber had 20 points
and 15 rebounds, leading the Kings past the Milwaukee Bucks, 98-73,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "That's about as solid as we've played on the road in a while,"
Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman said. "If we're going to stay up with
the people in the West, we've got to win these games on the road."</LD>
<TE>   Sacramento's 25-point margin of victory was its largest this
season on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first road game all season that we really played
well," Stojakovic said. "We talked about how we have to take our
practice game into the real game and play hard. Go hard out there and
I think that's what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson finished with 15 points in a reserve role, and Mike
Bibby had 13 points for the Kings, who improved their league-best
record to 44-17 and evened their road record at 14-14.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen and Sam Cassell combined to shoot 20 for
44 and each scored 14 points for the Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee absorbed its worst home loss this season, surpassing a
98-82 setback to Minnesota on Nov. 10.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have to say it's one of the lowest points in the last four
years since we've been winning," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   Leading by seven points in the third quarter, Sacramento used an
11-0 run to move ahead, 67-49. The Kings added an 8-0 run and
Jackson's three-pointer at the buzzer gave them a 78-53 lead after
three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson scored the first two field goals of the fourth quarter to
give the Kings a 29-point lead, their biggest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks started the game one for 11 and trailed, 11-2, before
closing within 25-20 after one quarter. The Kings led by as many as
14 points in the second quarter and had a 46-34 lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "When we didn't make shots early on, we lost our confidence out
there," Milwaukee Coach George Karl said. "That's kind of been our
Achilles' heal this year. Tonight, I thought our offense was the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively we were OK, but missing shots got us down early and
we never recovered."</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic scored 14 first-half points and Webber nearly completed
a double-double before halftime, finishing with 11 points and nine
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they're a jump-shooting team and we are a little more
fortunate that we have a little more presence inside," Webber said.
"We missed a lot of shots, too, but we executed well."</TE>

<HD>Sabres Give Hasek a Rude Reception</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dominik Hasek has many great memories of Buffalo. Sunday's homecoming
won't be among them.</LD>
<LD>   Pulled 40 minutes into a 5-1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres, the
goalie spent the final period alone in the Detroit Red Wing dressing
room riding an exercise bike.</LD>
<LD>   "What can I say? I was excited to be back, but disappointed after
the game," Hasek said. "We were a little sluggish, and I didn't have
my best game either. The way we played, we had no chance of beating
them."</LD>
<TE>   Hasek gave up four goals on the first 12 shots he faced in his
first trip back to Buffalo, where the six-time Vezina Trophy-winner
spent nine seasons before being traded to Detroit in July.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres, labeled by Hasek as noncontenders upon his departure
from Buffalo, came out strong and focused in beating the league's top
team. Miroslav Satan scored twice and Buffalo won its third in a row,
winning for the first time against Detroit in 12 games (1-10-1).</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended Detroit's franchise-record eight-game winning
streak on the road. Hasek had a 15-game (13-0-2) unbeaten streak
ended.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 6, Atlanta 1--Roman Hamrlik and Michael Peca
each scored two goals at Uniondale, N.Y., helping the Islanders end a
three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Thrashers lost their fifth in a row and are 0-6-1 in their
last seven road games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 4, Edmonton 2--Peter Bondra had his first three-goal
game this season, and Dmitri Khristich scored the game-winner 4:16
into the third period at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Columbus 0--Marian Gaborik scored three goals at St.

<HD>Old Maneuver Pays Off for Stewart at Atlanta</HD>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Stewart dipped into his past Sunday, and the result was his
first career 500-mile victory.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart slid under Ward Burton for the lead with 24 laps to go and
held off Dale Earnhardt Jr. to win the MBNA America 500 NASCAR race
at Atlanta Motor Speedway. It was Stewart's 13th career victory.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to get by [Burton] as fast as I could," Stewart said. "I
thought if we could get by him and get in clean air, we'd be all
right."</LD>
<TE>   The decisive pass came in Turn 1, when Stewart moved to the inside
and slid in front of Burton. It was similar to the "slide-job" passes
Stewart used throughout his sprint car days, although most of those
were on dirt.</TE>
<TE>   This was on pavement, and at 190 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "I had four or five of those today," Stewart said of the
technique. "You have to know where their weak spot is on the race
track. The biggest thing was, even if I had to check up when I got in
front of him, I just had to get in front."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart beat Earnhardt by about five car lengths. Rookie Jimmie
Johnson continued his surprising start, finishing third.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian Cristiano da Matta started the season the way he ended
2001--with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta successfully defended his title in Mexico's Monterrey
Grand Prix, his third consecutive CART FedEx Series victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dario Franchitti finished second and Christian Fittipaldi was
third.</TE>
<TE>   Michele Jourdain, in his first drive for Team Rahal, finished
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nicky Hayden dominated aboard his Honda RC51 to win his first
Daytona 200 By Arai by 18.225 seconds at Daytona (Fla.) International

<TE>   Boston's search for a new manager will take longer than expected
after the team contacted more clubs seeking permission to talk to
potential managerial candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox wanted to add former Twin skipper Tom Kelly to a list
that included Felipe Alou, Grady Little, and Mike Cubbage, but Kelly
rejected Boston late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "When they called Tom, he declined the interview," said Twin
General Manager Terry Ryan, who granted Boston permission late
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Red Sox interim General Manager Mike Port said "the field is still
wide open, so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   The team wanted to hire a manager by today--and officials worked
into the night Sunday--but acknowledged it may be as late as next
weekend before it's done.</TE>
<TE>   "We have aspirations, and we have realities," Port said when asked
if next weekend is realistic. "Only in terms of aspirations, that
would be great. In terms of reality and practicality, we just have to
see what develops."</TE>
<TE>   Port refused to identify what teams were contacted.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Ramon Hernandez and the Oakland Athletics agreed to a
$9.5-million, four-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez is credited with helping develop Oakland's young
pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   He batted .254 last season with 15 home runs and 60 runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Jose Rosado, 27, a two-time All-Star who has had two
shoulder surgeries since 2000, was placed on unconditional release
waivers by Kansas City.</TE>

<TE>   Michael von Gruenigen of Switzerland won a World Cup men's giant
slalom at Flachau, Austria, the season's final race, but Frederic
Covili of France won the championship, denying Stephan Eberharter a
sweep of the four season titles.</TE>
<TE>   Bode Miller finished in fourth place overall, the best World Cup
showing by an American man since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had 952 points overall.</TE>
<TE>   Triple Olympic gold medalist Janica Kostelic of Croatia won the
final women's World Cup slalom, at Flachau.</TE>
<TE>   France's Laure Pequegnot finished fifth to win the championship.
American Kristina Koznick was 13th at Flachau and finished second
overall.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian speedskater Catriona LeMay Doan won the 1,000-meter race
in the World Cup finals at Inzell, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   LeMay Doan was clocked in 1 minute 17.39 seconds. Jennifer
Rodriguez of the U.S. finished second in 1:17.80.</TE>
<TE>   The men's 1,500 was won by Ande Soendral of Norway, with Olympic
champion Derek Parra of San Bernardino finishing third.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Bahrke of the U.S. won the women's moguls title and Sami
Mustonen of Finland was the men's winner in a freestyle skiing World
Cup meet at Iiyama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Magdalena Forsberg won her last World Cup biathlon race.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, 34, retiring this month, won by 10 seconds at Ostersund,
Sweden, to close in on an unprecedented sixth consecutive overall
title.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg had only one miss in capturing her 41st World Cup
victory, more than any other female or male biathlete.</TE>
<TE>   Sven Hannawald of Germany won the ski jumping world championships
on the giant hill at Harrachov, Czech Republic, after the second day
of competition was canceled because of strong wind.</TE>
<TE>   Hannawald took the lead Saturday with two jumps of 202 meters.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. pole vaulter Jeff Hartwig cleared 19 feet 9 at Sindelfingen,
Germany, a height reached indoors previously by only Sergei Bubka of
Ukraine, who holds the world record at 20-2, and Radion Gataullin,
who also vaulted 19-9. Bubka had other vaults above 19-9.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Buser pushed through wind gusts to 48 mph along the coast
of Norton Sound and was moving at a record pace in the Iditarod trail
sled dog race.</TE>
<TE>   Buser reached Unalakleet, Alaska, three hours ahead of the pace
set by Doug Swingley in 2000, when he finished the 1,100-miles race
in just over nine days.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Amat Not Panicking Yet</HD>

<LD>It's not easy being the No. 1 team in the region ... and the state
... and the nation. With an experienced and talented nucleus that
helped La Puente Bishop Amat produce a 53-6 record over the last two
years and a Southern Section Division IV title in 2001, the Lancers
were at the top of the polls before the season began.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Amat could very well be ranked No. 1 when the season ends.
But like baseball teams at every level, the Lancers are beatable.
Bishop Amat begins the week with a 4-2 record, the losses coming
against San Luis Obispo and Moreno Valley Valley View.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Amat Coach Ken Kendrena said his players have not stumbled
trying to live up to expectations.</LD>
<TE>   "We just haven't been on all cylinders," said Kendrena, a Bishop
Amat graduate who was an All-American pitcher at Cal State Northridge
in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a couple kids that have been in the basketball
playoffs, and some others that have been hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "The last few years, we have been slow starters. So hopefully it
builds to what it always has. One good thing about losing is that you
learn you're not invincible."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat features five players who have already signed with
NCAA Division I schools. Adam Simon, a pitcher and outfielder, has
signed with UCLA, and shortstop Mike Lange, a four-year starter, is
bound for Santa Clara. Pitcher and first baseman Mark Esparza and
catcher Jordan Swaydan, a transfer from La Verne Damien, will go to
San Diego State, and second baseman David Pierson to St. Mary's.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson and pitcher Anthony Soto are now done with basketball, but
outfielder Alex Ramos, who hit a home run in last season's section
championship game at Dodger Stadium, and pitcher and third baseman
Anthony Hidalgo remain limited because of arm problems. Bishop Amat
defeated Yucaipa, 16-5, Friday and plays Fontana Kaiser on Tuesday in
its final game in the Chino tournament. Saturday, the Lancers play a
doubleheader at No. 18-ranked Newhall Hart.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a loss at the end of the year, you take it a lot
different than when it happens early," Kendrena said. "Right now, it
just shows that you have to keep working, and this is a special group
that has always done that."</TE>

<TE>   Senior third baseman Kiel Fisher led Riverside Poly (5-0) to the
North Orange County tournament championship. He hit five home runs,
drove in 10 runs and pitched in four games. Poly plays Santa Ana
Mater Dei (4-1) today at 4 p.m. at Cal State Fullerton....</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei avenged its only loss by beating La Habra Sonora, 5-0,
in the championship game of the Newport Elks tournament. Warren
Chenier threw a three-hitter.... Junior shortstop Josh Satin of North
Hollywood Harvard-Westlake (4-1) was one of the top hitters in the
San Fernando Valley tournament. He was nine for 17, including four
home runs, a triple, double and 10 runs batted in....</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia won the Blue Division championship of the El Segundo
tournament with a 6-4, eight-inning victory over Encino Crespi.
Sophomore Trevor Plouffe of Crespi was selected the tournament's top
pitcher after throwing consecutive shutouts.... Lakewood (5-0) won
the Loara tournament championship with a 6-4 victory over Dana
Hills....Freshman right-hander Andy Kellogg of Newbury Park is 2-0,
with 16 strikeouts in 11 innings, and has allowed only one earned
run....</TE>
<TE>   Senior right-hander Eddie Baeza of Sun Valley Poly was considered
to be among the best pitchers in the City Section, and he's living up
to expectations. He has thrown two five-inning shutouts, giving up
one hit while striking out 22 and walking one....The West Valley
League has stamped itself as the toughest in the City Section, with
Chatsworth (5-0), Van Nuys Birmingham (5-0) and Reseda Cleveland
(5-0) off to perfect starts.</TE>

<HD>San Marcos Is Showing Why It's the No. 1 Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everybody figured that top-ranked Santa Barbara San Marcos would be
good this year, but nobody could have guessed it would be this good.</LD>
<LD>   The Lions, defending champions in both the Southern Section and
CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. Championships, have averaged 368
in their first four matches. That includes a round of four-under-par
351 at Glen Annie Golf Club.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, a team score of four-under. It wasn't long ago that
shooting under par as a team was unheard of, but San Marcos did it
last year in winning the section title and Santa Margarita did it in
winning the 2000 CIF-SCGA title.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Aaron Solis downplayed the accomplishment, but added that it
could have been even better.</TE>
<TE>   "Glen Annie isn't that tough of a course," Solis said. "We had our
chances to be in the 340s."</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos showcased its depth in that match as Jake Clemens,
playing the No. 6 spot that day, was medalist with a two-under 69.
Tyler Ley, Kevin Larsen and David Siordia each shot 70 and the Lions
threw out a 78.</TE>
<TE>   The worst score for San Marcos so far is a 383 at Sandpiper Golf
Course, but Ley didn't play that day and the wind was gusting at
about 35 miles an hour, Solis said.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, so good," Solis said about his team's start. "But it's
not how you start, it's how you finish."</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos gets a tough test Thursday when it meets No. 2 Santa
Margarita at La Purisima.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goleta Dos Pueblos was a tough-luck victim of that 351 by San
Marcos. Dos Pueblos shot a school-record 362 that day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pansing Singhaseni is eligible to play for Beverly Hills this year
after sitting out last year because of transfer ineligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Singhaseni, a senior, attended the David Ledbetter Academy in
Florida for the first semester of his junior year and transferred
back to Beverly Hills for his second semester, but could not play
high school golf because it's a fall sport in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "He would have been playing two seasons in one school year,"
Beverly Hills Coach Jason Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   Singhaseni, among the top-ranked junior players in the nation,
finished tied for second in the Southern Section individual
championships as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City Section teams have changed scoring formats and will count
four out of seven scores rather than five out of six. The change was
made so the number of scoring players would be equal with girls'
teams from the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The season-ending CIF-SCGA tournament, which includes teams from
the San Diego, Southern, Central and City sections, will also count
four of six scores. The Southern Section finals will count five out
of six.</TE>

<HD>Irwin Has the Right Clubs</HD>
<DH>Golf: He wins the Toshiba Senior Classic by using new irons
and fairway woods for record 17-under-par 196.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most golfers say it's not the club that matters, it's the person
swinging the club.</LD>
<LD>   For Hale Irwin, it appears to be both.</LD>
<LD>   He started the Toshiba Senior Classic at the Newport Beach Country
Club with all new clubs in his bag except for his driver and putter,
and his play over the three rounds was nearly as perfect as the
weather.</LD>
<TE>   Irwin shot a six-under-par 65 Sunday to complete a record-setting
54-hole total of 17-under-par 196 and earn a five-stroke victory over
Allen Doyle.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's total broke the tournament record of 199, set by George
Archer in the first Toshiba, played at Mesa Verde Country Club in
Costa Mesa in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament moved to Newport Beach the next year, and the
previous record for this course was 200, set by Irwin in 1998, when
he finished with a 62 to overtake 11 players and beat Hubert Green by
one stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, who turns 57 in June, came into the final round this time
with a three-stroke lead. It was the 23rd time he came into the final
round with a lead and the 18th he emerged with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   In career win No. 34 on the Senior PGA Tour, Irwin used new irons
with forged iron blades and steel shafts instead of graphite. And
even though he shot a 64 on Saturday, he used a new three-wood and a
new four-wood Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still struggling with those clubs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling?</TE>
<TE>   "On this course, those clubs aren't as important as some of the
other clubs in your bag," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The club that was really working was his putter, the oldest club
in his bag.</TE>
<TE>   "My putter carried the day," he said. "When it got close I seemed
to make birdies."</TE>
<TE>   But it was a par on the 339-yard first hole that Irwin singled out
for setting the tone. He hit a two-iron off the tee into the right
rough, then flew the green with a nine-iron. His pitch went six feet
past the hole, but he made the putt coming back.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin missed a three-foot putt and took a bogey on No. 5, then
reeled off three consecutive birdies, making a 25-foot putt on the
par-three eighth hole. He also made a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 16.
His three-footer on the 18th gave him seven birdies for the day.</TE>
<TE>   So will Irwin be changing clubs again anytime soon?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe," he said. "You're always looking for the club, the shot,
the score."</TE>
<TE>   And how big a role do the clubs play?</TE>
<TE>   Irwin smiled and said, "When I play well, it's me. When I play
poorly, it's them."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's victory earned him 225 points in the Charles Schwab Cup
race and enabled him to jump ahead of Tom Kite. Irwin now has 718
points and Kite, who won at Valencia the previous week, has 606. Kite
withdrew from the Toshiba on Friday because of back spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin also earned $225,000 to take over the money lead from Kite.
He has $735,000 in season earnings, compared to Kite's $608,600.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle, who shot a final-round 67, was alone at 201, and Dave
Stockton and qualifier Michael Zinni tied for third at 202. Zinni
shot a 67 Sunday. His finish was the best for a qualifier in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Stockton was encouraged after shooting a 66 Sunday but afterward
said he was saddened to hear earlier in the day that his longtime
friend, Larry Carr, 61, of Bakersfield had succumbed to cancer.
Stockton and Carr were teammates on the USC golf team.</TE>
<TE>   A gallery estimated at 26,000 watched Sunday's action and
tournament Chairman Hank Adler said the tournament raised more than
$1 million for charity for the third consecutive year.</TE>

<HD>For Americans, It's One and Out</HD>
<DH>Soccer: U.S. defeats Ecuador, 1-0, on Lewis' goal, but
loses Mathis for next game against Germany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former UCLA winger Eddie Lewis enhanced his chances of making the
United States roster for this summer's World Cup by scoring a
memorable goal Sunday as the U.S. defeated Ecuador, 1-0, in front
24,133 at Legion Field in Birmingham, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   For Clint Mathis, meanwhile, it was a much less pleasant afternoon
of soccer.</LD>
<LD>   After setting up Lewis' 21st-minute goal with an excellent pass,
Mathis found himself tossed out of the game in the 59th minute for
his second clumsy foul of the match.</LD>
<TE>   "I get hit in the mouth and I get a ... red card?" Mathis fumed as
he walked off the field, the intervening profanity broadcast across
America courtesy of the live coverage by ABC and Telemundo.</TE>
<TE>   Playing a man short, the Americans managed to hold an
injury-depleted and consequently unimaginative Ecuador team at bay
for the final half-hour or so, but Mathis' ejection will prove costly
later this month.</TE>
<TE>   The red card means the New York/New Jersey MetroStar striker will
have to sit out the U.S. team's next game, against three-time world
champion Germany on March 27 in Rostock, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   As galling for Mathis was the fact that most of his family had
made the trek to Birmingham from Conyers, Ga., to see him play.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mathis' MetroStar teammate, goalkeeper Tim Howard, made
a solid national team debut, earning the shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Also turning in eye-catching performances as they fight to be
among the 23 players chosen to go to the World Cup in Japan and South
Korea in May were defenders Gregg Berhalter and Carlos Llamosa, the
latter returning from injury but showing that he has lost none of his
calming influence on the back line.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a 4-0 rout of Honduras in Seattle a week earlier, when
Mathis and Landon Donovan had each scored two goals, the U.S. team
attacked the South Americans from the start.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's defenders presented more of a physical challenge than
the Hondurans and Lewis' goal was the result of some imaginative work
by the American team.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's Cobi Jones started the move with a long pass from
inside his own half down into the left corner.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Lewis was supposed to be, but he had cut inside, and
it was Mathis who chased down the ball and then sent a diagonal pass
back into the penalty area for Lewis to fire a first-time shot with
his left foot. The blast gave three nearby defenders and Ecuador's
veteran goalkeeper, Jose Francisco Cevallos, no chance.</TE>
<TE>   The ill-tempered game was marred by numerous fouls as Salvadoran
referee Rodolfo Sibrian struggled to maintain control.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's Edwin Tenorio could have been ejected after shoving the
referee, but instead it was Mathis who was tossed out in the second
45 minutes when he picked up a second yellow card after bringing down
Edison Mendez on a breakaway as the South Americans desperately
sought the tying goal.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. victory was its first against Ecuador in nine games,
having come into the match with a 0-4-4 record.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador, which will play Italy, Mexico and Croatia in the first
round of the World Cup, was missing its three main forwards, Augustin
Delgado, Ivan Kaviedes and Angel Fernandez, as well as its key
defender and captain, Ivan Hurtado, because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, it created few clear scoring chances, its best
efforts coming off corner kicks as two headers flew narrowly wide of
Howard's net.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., meanwhile, is 6-1-1 in 2002 and has yielded only two
goals this year as it prepares to face Portugal, South Korea and
Poland at the World Cup.</TE>

<HD>Agassi Earns 50th</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This time, there were no obstacles Andre Agassi couldn't handle.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Agassi changed his three-year run of bad luck in
the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic by beating Juan Balcells, 6-2,
7-6 (2), Sunday for the 50th title of his career at Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   "It means a lot now," said the 31-year-old Agassi, who last year
became the oldest player to finish in the ATP's top three since Jimmy
Connors in 1984. "Before the match, you're really thinking about your
opponent and what you need to do. But you get done with it and it
kind of hits you."</LD>
<TE>   By winning two-thirds of his 75 finals, Agassi became the eighth
player to win 50 championships in the open era, which began in 1968.
Among active players, he trails only Pete Sampras, who has 63 titles.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi presented the trophy to his father, Mike.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A chest cold and Davide Sanguinetti were too much for Andy Roddick
to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Sanguinetti won the second tournament title of his nine-year
career and his second in five weeks, beating an ailing Roddick, 6-4,
4-6, 6-4, in the final at the International Tennis Championships at
Delray Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat was the top-seeded Roddick's first in five career
finals.</TE>
<TE>   Sanguinetti beat Jan-Michael Gambill in the semifinals. The
29-year-old Italian won his first ATP Tour title last month in Milan.</TE>

<HD>Final Cut / Invitations Go Out to 65 Teams Headed for a
64-Game, 21-Day Frenzy</HD>
<DH>Trojans Appreciate Respect Shown by Selection Committee</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sense of anticipation that saturated USC's Galen Center Sunday
afternoon was replaced by one of pride after the Trojans' seeding and
draw for the NCAA tournament were revealed.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans, who had gathered to watch the selection show in the
on-campus athletic dining facility, had a familiar swagger in their
step and their chests puffed out a bit after being awarded a No. 4
seeding in the South Regional.</LD>
<LD>   USC (22-9) will play 13th-seeded North Carolina Wilmington (22-9),
champion of the Colonial Athletic Assn., in a first-round game
Thursday. It is USC's highest seeding since getting a No. 2 in 1992
and, with the NCAA making a concerted effort to keep higher-seeded
teams closer to home, the Trojans will be playing at Sacramento's
Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's a sign of recognition and respect by the people in
the selection committee," USC senior forward Sam Clancy said. "I
think they saw what we did all year. We've come a long way, a long
way from not making the tournament to going to the Elite Eight last
year to where we're at now."</TE>
<TE>   In awarding the Trojans a No. 4 seeding, the selection committee
basically told USC that it is one of the top 16 teams in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that what that means?" USC Coach Henry Bibby asked with a
smile. "Well then, that's good. I like that.</TE>
<TE>   "But now let's just play basketball because ... seeds four through
13, there are always upsets."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't figure to happen in the Trojans' case, though.</TE>
<TE>   USC is playing perhaps its best basketball of the season after
advancing to the championship game of the Pacific 10 Conference
tournament this weekend by beating No. 16 Stanford, 103-78, and No. 9
Oregon, 89-78, before tiring and falling to No. 15 Arizona, 81-71.</TE>
<TE>   Having played three grueling games of full-court press defense in
three days, the No. 22-ranked Trojans also were rewarded in that they
don't have to travel cross-country for a first-round game as they did
last year when a No. 6 seeding sent them to Long Island, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only an hour flight so it should be an advantage for us,"
Bibby said of playing in Northern California. "Hopefully it works out
for us. We're not out of our element, the element of flying an hour
to play Berkeley [California] or Stanford [in a regular-season game].
That's what I'm pleased with."</TE>
<TE>   Said USC senior guard Brandon Granville: "We don't have to fly
cross-country, worry about a time change or the weather. Plus, we
should get added fan support and that energizes us and helps us play
with more energy."</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Wilmington, meanwhile, is less than thrilled about
having to travel so far.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be disappointed because there are a lot of other teams
who have their equipment packed away," Seahawk Coach Jerry Wainwright
said. "Do we want to play in Sacramento? Of course not. Do we want to
play in the NCAA tournament? Of course we do.</TE>
<TE>   "There might be some deflation because it's three time zones away.
It has nothing to do with our spirit and will. It's more that few of
our families will be able to see us in person. Somebody had to
travel. I just don't know why it was us."</TE>
<TE>   While the Trojans admitted they know little about the Seahawks,
USC does have tape of them in house.</TE>
<TE>   In preparing to face Miami of Ohio on Dec. 16, the Trojans watched
video of the RedHawks. Their opponent on the tape--North Carolina
Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks beat the RedHawks, 50-42, at home on Nov. 17, before
USC held on for a 59-55 victory at the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, though, will have to delve deeper in their
preparations.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," Granville said when asked what he knew about North
Carolina Wilmington. "Absolutely nothing. Most of us don't have a
clue. They probably know us more than we know them."</TE>
<TE>   So, by way of introduction ...</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks, who began the season with a 79-78 loss at Wake
Forest in the preseason National Invitation Tournament, enter the
NCAA tournament having won 10 of 12, including their league
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   They can play either a slow-down, half-court offense or get it
going in transition. The Seahawks are averaging 67.1 points while
giving up 60.2. Junior shooting guard Brett Blizzard, who leads the
team with a 17.5-point scoring average, loves to shoot it from the
outside. He has already launched 213 three-point attempts, making 39%
of them.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy said the Trojans couldn't get ahead of themselves by
looking at possible second-round or Sweet 16 opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I know from tournament experience that you can't take anyone
lightly," he said. "We can't look ahead to Indiana or Duke or we'll
go home early."</TE>
<TE>   If that were to happen to the Trojans, the respect afforded them
by their relatively high seeding would be for naught.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're gradually getting more respect," Granville said.
"We're still searching for more, though, and that's what keeps us
hungry."</TE>

<HD>Stevenson Stepping Up</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Her upset of Dementieva is reminder of the ability
she showed when she began tour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Alexandra Stevenson's arrival on the women's pro tennis scene was
similar to her forehand. Explosive.</LD>
<LD>   She was a teenager from San Diego who had played a lot of junior
tournaments in the Southland and competed a lot against the Williams
sisters. She was tall, strong and athletic, but when she turned pro
in June of 1999, at 18 years old, there was no expectation of what
would come next.</LD>
<LD>   What did was a double stunner.</LD>
<TE>   First, she blasted her way into the semifinals of Wimbledon. Then,
in the midst of her run, the story broke that her father, whom she
never knew and with whom she never had a relationship, was pro
basketball great Julius Erving. Her mother, Samantha, had been a
freelance writer in the East during the golden years of Dr. J.</TE>
<TE>   But fame and success went away as quickly as it came for
Alexandra, who drifted in the tour rankings between No. 50 and 100
the last two years. She was able to enter a number of events through
wild cards and exemptions, but those were running out.</TE>
<TE>   Now, at 21, with a game that still is built around power from her
serve and the baseline but seems to have incorporated elements of
poise and control, Stevenson is beginning to make a move.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, she pounded her way into the round of 16 in the Pacific
Life Open, and did so against a quality opponent. Her 6-4, 0-6, 6-4
victory over Russia's Elena Dementieva, a former U.S. Open
semifinalist who was seeded eighth here, was among her better results
and put her against another quality opponent, No. 10 Amanda Coetzer
of South Africa, in the next round.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I played [Dementieva], I didn't close out the
match," said Stevenson, referring to an October defeat in Moscow.
"This time, I was like, 'You're closing it out, you're not walking
away, losing your serve.' I'm happy I did that."</TE>
<TE>   She won the first set with two aces at 5-4 and deuce. The first
one was 112 mph, the second 109.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the serve is the key," she said. "Just like Sampras, his
serve is the key."</TE>
<TE>   With top-seeded Kim Clijsters of Belgium already out of the event,
No. 2 Martina Hingis of Switzerland took on her familiar role of
tournament favorite--she was No. 1 on the women's tour for 209
weeks--with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Russian Elena Likhovtseva, a
dangerous veteran who has hovered in the top 25 for the last six
years and who has won more than $2 million in prize money. Hingis
said she has a sore wrist, but it is nothing that should keep her
from continuing here.</TE>
<TE>   Also advancing on a warm and sunny day in the desert were
third-seeded Justine Henin of Belgium, 6-3, 6-0, over Adriana Serra
Zanetti of Italy, and ninth-seeded Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario of Spain,
a 6-4, 6-4 winner over Daja Bedanova of the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Nathalie Dechy of France, who ousted top-seeded Clijsters, was in
turn upset by Anastasia Myskina of Russia, 7-6 (2), 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The men's portion of the Pacific Life event will begin today. Two
of the top entries were in finals Sunday. At Scottsdale, Ariz., Andre
Agassi took his 50th title; and at Delray Beach, Fla., Andy Roddick
lost a three-setter, struggling against former UCLA star Davide
Sanguinette. Roddick complained of illness afterward, raising the
possibility that he may withdraw here.</TE>

<HD>L.A. May Host WTA's Premier Event</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Championships will likely move from Germany to
Staples Center this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>The WTA Tour is likely to move its troubled season-ending
championships from Munich, Germany, to Staples Center this year,
pending approval of its board of directors, sources said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   That could come shortly because a scheduled meeting of the board
is at the next major tournament, in Key Biscayne, Fla., which starts
March 18. Approval is anticipated but one source said the deal is not
certain, pointing out: "Anything can happen in two weeks when it
comes to tennis."</LD>
<LD>   At the Pacific Life Open, WTA officials declined comment, and Tim
Leiweke, president of Staples Center and the Anschutz Entertainment
Group, was traveling and could not be reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Negotiations have been in the works since late last year. Kevin
Wulff, the WTA's new chief executive officer, made two trips to Los
Angeles near the end of 2001 to meet with AEG officials. Wulff and
Leiweke have a business relationship dating back to when Leiweke
worked for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Wulff was an executive with
Miller Brewing Company.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is a great tennis market and we'd love to get AEG involved,"
said Wulff at the Australian Open in January.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Leiweke would not speak about the
negotiations between AEG and the WTA regarding the championships.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking to a lot of people about a lot of different things
in tennis," Leiweke said. "And some of those conversations are
related to L.A., some are related to other things."</TE>
<TE>   It's been no secret the tour was looking for another spot for its
premier event. For years, it was based in New York at Madison Square
Garden and attendance plummeted in 2001 after the move to the
Olympiahalle in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance for the six-day event was 36,500, compared to 94,133
the final year at the Garden, according to WTA figures.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams did not play in the event because of an injury, and
Monica Seles has refused to play in Germany since she was stabbed in
Hamburg in 1993, and she was greatly upset by the decision to move
the tournament from New York to Munich.</TE>
<TE>   The move could trigger a series of other events.</TE>
<TE>   Groundbreaking was last month in Carson for AEG's $120-million
sports complex, which will feature a 13,000-seat tennis stadium, and
there have been long-running discussions between AEG, the WTA and
management company IMG about moving the Manhattan Beach women's
tournament to Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the WTA finds itself in a state of flux. There has been
speculation the organization could move its corporate headquarters
from St. Petersburg, Fla., to Los Angeles. Atlanta is said to be
another possibility.</TE>

<LD>Once again finding themselves on the outside looking in at the NCAA
tournament despite 21 victories, UC Irvine (21-10) will settle for a
berth in the National Invitation Tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The Anteaters will play Brigham Young (17-11) in the first round
Thursday night on BYU's home court in Provo, Utah. Unfortunately for
the Anteaters, BYU is 15-0 at home this season.</LD>
<LD>   This will be the fourth NIT appearance for the Anteaters, who lost
to eventual 2001 NIT champion Tulsa, 75-71, in the first round last
March in Tulsa.</LD>
<TE>   "We are excited to have the chance for postseason play," Anteater
Coach Pat Douglass said in a statement on the UC Irvine Web site.
"Obviously we wanted to win our league tournament, but that didn't
happen, so we are just happy to continue playing."</TE>
<TE>   UCI lost in the semifinals of the Big West tournament to eventual
champion UC Santa Barbara, 66-61, last Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   BYU is coached by Steve Cleveland, a former UCI player in the
1974-75 and 1975-76 seasons. Junior forward Travis Hansen leads the
Cougars in scoring at 15.3 points per game and in rebounding with a
6.4 average. The Cougars lost to San Diego State, 62-51, in the
quarterfinals of the Mountain West tournament last Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlantic 10 Conference, which had only Xavier selected for the
NCAA tournament, had five teams picked for the NIT's expanded 40-team
field.</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown (19-11) became only the second team in tournament
history to turn down an invitation.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyas Coach Craig Esherick said he couldn't accept the invitation
because his team was going to be sent on the road and he didn't want
his players missing classes.</TE>
<TE>   The only other team to ever turn down the NIT was Louisville in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond, Saint Joseph's, St. Bonaventure, Temple and Dayton were
the Atlantic 10 teams selected for the NIT, which gets under way
Tuesday with five games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four members of the Pacific 10 were invited to the Women's NIT:
USC, Washington, Oregon State and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   USC plays at San Francisco when the Women's NIT opens Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>One Down, One to Go for Duke</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Mike Krzyzewski has been in enough championship settings to get a
good read on his team. He knew to keep quiet Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "They had gotten themselves up for the game. When I went into my
pregame talk I said, 'You better not say too much, you'll ruin the
moment,'" Krzyzewski said following Duke's 91-61 victory over North
Carolina State in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game.</LD>
<LD>   ''I love that because that's the maturity that has developed over
the last couple of weeks."</LD>
<TE>   The third-ranked Blue Devils (29-3) became the first program in
the 49 years of the Atlantic Coast Conference to win four consecutive
championships as most valuable player Carlos Boozer scored 26 points,
Jason Williams added 24 and Mike Dunleavy had 18.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this league 22 years and I know how precious each
tournament win is," Krzyzewski said when asked about the four
consecutive titles. "It's a little bit hard to believe."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-9, 280-pound Boozer was 11 of 12 from the field and
finished 20 of 24 in three tournament games. He was 33 of 39 in three
games this season against N.C. State.</TE>
<TE>   Boozer missed the first shot of the game, then made 11 in a row to
dominate the Wolfpack (22-10), which is led by Anthony Grundy's 13
points.</TE>
<TE>   Duke's 63.5% shooting set a championship game record and its
winning margin was the second-largest in tournament history.</TE>
<TE>   Only N.C. State (1954-56) and North Carolina (1967-69) had won
three consecutive championships before Duke's current run.</TE>

<HD>Sooners Make No. 1 Kansas Pay the Price</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Hollis Price struggled to score in the first two games of the
Big 12 men's basketball tournament, Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson
said he wasn't worried.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out, Sampson had no reason to be.</LD>
<LD>   Price scored 23 points, including two clutch three-pointers that
turned back a second-half rally by No. 1 Kansas, and No. 4 Oklahoma
won its second consecutive Big 12 tournament with a 64-55 victory
Sunday at Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<TE>   Price also led a swarming defensive effort and was selected the
tournament's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew if something was going to happen for us, somebody was
going to have to make it happen," Price said. "You can't run sets
against a team like Kansas, and Kansas can't run sets against a team
like us. Someone had to just step up and create."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Big 12 title, Oklahoma (27-4) did not get a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA tournament. The Sooners are the No. 2 seed in the West
Regional and will play Illinois-Chicago on Friday at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks (29-3), who went 16-0 in the Big 12 regular season,
are seeded No. 1 in the Midwest Regional. They will play Holy Cross
on Thursday at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Gooden had 22 points and 15 rebounds but committed six
turnovers for Kansas, which had its string of 18 consecutive
victories over conference opponents ended.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks, the highest-scoring team in the nation, were held 12
points below their previous low this season--also against the
Sooners.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time we played Kansas we learned a lot about post
defense and how it has to be everyone's responsibility," Sampson
said. "It's not just having a 7-footer who can swat shots, or a big
guy who can belly up--it's five people's responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma shot only 34% (24 for 71) from the field, its third poor
shooting performance in as many games, but Price made the big shots.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to force two ties
midway through the second half and trailed, 49-47, after a dunk by
Gooden with 7:02 left.</TE>
<TE>   Price made two three-pointers in the next 82 seconds, and Jabahri
Brown scored with 4:13 left to make it 57-49.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas could not get closer than four points after that.</TE>
<TE>   "I get tired of hearing that anyone wants things more than I do,
yet at the same time they played tougher than us," Kansas Coach Roy
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "To say they have more motivation would definitely bother me. I
know Kelvin wanted to win, but there is no way on God's green earth
that I would think he wanted it more than me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BIG TEN</TE>
<TE>   Four teams staked their claims to being the Big Ten's best squad
during the regular season. Boban Savovic made sure only Ohio State
was left standing after the conference's tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Savovic scored 27 points to lead the No. 21 Buckeyes over Iowa,
81-64, in the tournament final at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State (23-7) shared the regular-season title with Indiana,
Illinois and Wisconsin, but the Buckeyes were the only one of the
four to reach the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes led by three points midway through the second half
before two three-pointers by Savovic put the game away during a 21-8
run.</TE>
<TE>   "He was possessed a little bit," teammate Brian Brown said. "He
got us motivated. I think he just singlehandedly opened the game up."</TE>
<TE>   Savovic, Brown and teammate Brent Darby were selected to the
all-tournament team.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes were seeded fourth in the West Regional for the NCAA
tournament and will play 13th-seeded Davidson at Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   Savovic, who scored 15 points in the second half, said he was
motivated by his brother Predrag's 28-point game for Hawaii in the
Western Athletic Conference tournament final.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii was seeded 10th, also in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just hoping we were going to win because I knew he was
going to tease me about it," Savovic said. "Now we got a No. 4 seed
and he got a No. 10, so I can't wait to talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State Coach Jim O'Brien was disappointed his team won't be
playing closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "It just reinforces the confusion and how much I don't understand
about how this works," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what consideration was given to us winning this
tournament. I don't think it's anything for us to dwell on. Now it's
about going to play against Davidson."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa (19-15) proved too weary to stay with the Buckeyes, who
earned their fourth consecutive NCAA tournament bid.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Recker, Iowa's hero in the last two victories, finished with
21 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOUTHEASTERN</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State can no longer be overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   Largely ignored much of the season, the Bulldogs won their second
Southeastern Conference tournament title and earned an automatic NCAA
bid with a 61-58 victory over regular-season champion Alabama at
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State (26-7) matched the school record for victories,
set by the 1995-96 team that won the first tournament championship
and reached the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a showcase, to show people how good a basketball team we
are," Coach Rick Stansbury said. "I know this team has earned respect
now."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Austin, the tournament's MVP, led the Bulldogs with 15
points and eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   SEC player of the year Erwin Dudley led the Crimson Tide (26-7)
with 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State improved to 15-0 when holding an opponent to
less than 65 points.</TE>

<LD>No. 1 MARYLAND (26-4)</LD>
<LD>   First-round opponent: Alcorn State-Siena winner.</LD>
<LD>   Season in brief: Ranked No. 2 at the end of the regular season,
the Terrapins lost in the ACC tournament semifinals. They reached the
Final Four last season but stumbled in season-opening loss to Arizona
and were defeated soundly at Oklahoma and Duke. Then the Terrapins
stunned everyone by blowing out Duke in the rematch and winning the
ACC regular-season title.</LD>
<TE>   Player to watch: Juan Dixon. The high-scoring 6-3, 160-pound
senior guard overcame an unimaginable family tragedy--the death of
both parents from AIDS contracted as drug-users.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Chris Wilcox, a sophomore forward with eye-popping
athleticism, was once the top high school recruit in North Carolina,
but Maryland took him away from the state's bevy of basketball
schools.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Gary Williams did what Lefty Driesell never managed,
taking Maryland to its first Final Four last season in the school's
18th NCAA appearance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 CONNECTICUT (24-6)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Huskies won the East division of the Big East
and the conference tournament. They are once again one of the
national leaders in field-goal percentage defense, holding teams
under 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Caron Butler. The 6-7 sophomore forward shared
conference player of the year with Pittsburgh's Brandin Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Coach Jim Calhoun has won more than 600 games, ranking
10th among active coaches.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Won NCAA title over heavy favorite Duke in 1999.

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 GEORGIA (21-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Murray State.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Jim Harrick's team was picked to finish well back
in the SEC after major losses from last season's NCAA team. Despite
rape allegations involving players, the Bulldogs thrived on the
court, gaining the No. 1 seed for the SEC tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Jarvis Hayes. The 6-6 sophomore swingman, an
extremely athletic scorer, transferred from Western Carolina along
with his twin, Jonas.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Harrick is one of only three coaches to take four schools
to the NCAA tournament. Lefty Driesell and Eddie Sutton are the
others.</TE>

lost to North Carolina State in a Final Four semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 KENTUCKY (20-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Valparaiso.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: A disappointing season included a home loss to
Western Kentucky and a sweep at the hands of Georgia. Still, an
overtime loss to Duke showed the Wildcats' potential. Off-court
turmoil ranged from center Marvin Stone's departure to suspensions to
Gerald Fitch and Erik Daniels for using false identification to try
to enter a nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Tayshaun Prince. The 6-9 senior forward withdrew
from the NBA draft and returned for his senior season but has not
improved his draft status.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Coach Tubby Smith was one of 17 children.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Seven NCAA titles, including 1996 and '98. Lost to USC

national scene, earning its highest ranking in more than 20 years in
the Golden Eagles' third season under Tom Crean, the former Michigan
State assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Dwyane Wade. The 6-4 sophomore guard sat out last
season after not meeting academic requirements for freshman
eligibility, but made an impact this season.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Marquette has unveiled plans for the Al McGuire Center, a
$31-million practice facility to be named in honor of the late coach

added some junior college transfers and helped Texas Tech reach the
Top 25.</TE>

seven-points-a-game scorer to a first-team all-conference player.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Knight was only 35 when he won the first of his three NCAA
championships at Indiana in 1976--making him the fourth youngest ever
to win a national title.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Ten appearances overall, the most recent in 1996 when
the Red Raiders reached the Sweet 16 under James Dickey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   First-round opponent: Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Coach Herb Sendek's job was on the line after
going 13-16 last season, but the Wolfpack's resurgence has given him
a reprieve. North Carolina State defeated Maryland in the ACC
semifinals</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Anthony Grundy. The 6-3 senior guard was the only
non-Duke and Maryland player to be an all-ACC first-team selections.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Some people think freshman forward Ilian Evtimov will be a
better player for the Wolfpack than highly touted Julius Hodge.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: First appearance since 1991, but forever remembered for
the moment Lorenzo Charles slammed home Dereck Whittenburg's airball
just before the buzzer to upset Houston in the 1983 championship
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 WISCONSIN (18-12)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: St. John's.</TE>

including a 20-point loss to Notre Dame in the Big East
quarterfinals.</TE>

close to 20 points a game, played at Tallahassee (Fla.) Community
College, the school that produced former St. John's star Bootsy
Thornton.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: With its 27th appearance, St. John's has played in more
NCAA tournaments than all but six other schools. (Kentucky leads with
44.)</TE>

<TE>   First-round opponent: North Carolina State.</TE>

<TE>   First-round opponent: Texas Tech.</TE>

berths.</TE>

<HD>In Indiana, Long National Knightmare Never Ends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ghost of Bob Knight still haunts Indiana, his likeness on
billboards above city streets, his name in all the newspapers.</LD>
<LD>   More than a year after the controversial coach was fired, die-hard
fans have not forgotten. Many have adopted his new school, wearing
Texas Tech caps, a sacrilege in the land of the Hoosiers.</LD>
<LD>   At games this season, as Indiana played its way into the NCAA
tournament, his supporters were known to mention Knight whenever they
heard profanity in Assembly Hall--and not for the reason you might
expect. They proudly insist he never tolerated foul language from the
stands, grabbing the microphone to castigate fans.</LD>
<TE>   Such is the cult of personality that surrounded the man.</TE>
<TE>   "People are resolved that Bob Knight is not coming back," said
David Martin, a university administrator who oversees the booster
club. "But with the fervor that Bob Knight creates, they have kept
him very much alive."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone mourned his departure in September 2000, when he was
dismissed for allegedly accosting a student, the last in a string of
troublesome incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Professors say they no longer hear snide comments when they attend
academic conferences out of state. And though some alumni angrily
turned their backs, the university attracted enough new donors to
raise $220 million, a school record, last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, they told us they would never give as long as Bob Knight
was coach," said Barbara Coffman, a spokeswoman for the Indiana
University Foundation. Now those benefactors are saying, "Here's my
check."</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Knight contingent is quick to point out that Indiana had
a proud basketball tradition long before the man known as "the
General" came along. There were two national championships and a
much-honored coach in Branch McCracken. Now there is praise for Mike
Davis, a quiet and capable leader who guided the team to 21
victories--a school record for a first-year coach--last season. The
Hoosiers are Big Ten co-champions this season.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the program is enjoying a newfound calm. Gone are the
distractions of a man infamous for behavior that ranged from throwing
a chair and allegedly assaulting players to an altercation with a
Puerto Rican policeman and accidentally shooting a hunting pal.</TE>
<TE>   "People watch the players now," said Murray Sperber, an English
professor and one of Knight's loudest critics. "It has gone back to
being a normal basketball school."</TE>
<TE>   But for all the baggage that Knight carried, he also ranks among
the winningest coaches in college basketball history, which counts
for much in a hoops-crazy state.</TE>
<TE>   His record of 661-240 over nearly three decades far outpaced what
McCracken managed in the 1940s, '50s and early '60s. He
recruited--and coached--a long list of All-Americans, was coach of
the year multiple times and led his team to three national
championships.</TE>
<TE>   Since his departure, some believe Indiana basketball has lost more
than just that famous red sweater. Bob Hammel, the longtime former
sports editor and columnist for the Bloomington Herald-Times--and a
Knight confidant--says the difference is obvious to a
basketball-savvy populace.</TE>
<TE>   "People became so used to seeing the motion offense, nothing but
good shots, and good man-to-man defense," Hammel said. "Even things
like decorum in the stands. This is one arena in America where you
never heard the word 'bull ... ' Now you do."</TE>
<TE>   University administrators know better than to get upset at such
comparisons. They know that firing a legend is never easy.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe if the Hoosiers win their first-round game in the NCAA
tournament this week--something Knight struggled with near the end of
his tenure--the specter of the former coach will be nudged somewhat
aside.</TE>
<TE>   If the team loses, however, a few more fans might stop by the
General's Store in Indianapolis. Owned by Knight's son and run by
Knight's former wife, Nancy, the shop sells all manner of Texas Tech
paraphernalia--caps, shirts, flags, media guides, glow-in-the-dark
basketballs.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even advertise," Nancy said. "People come looking for
us. It's all by word of mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana administrators are not amused. "I don't like to see people
wear those caps around town," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does it help that ESPN showed a feature-length movie about
Knight on Sunday, a program that was discussed prominently in
newspapers and advertised throughout the state on billboards showing
actor Brian Dennehy with the trademark sweater and scowl.</TE>
<TE>   A biography, "Knight: My Story," co-written by Hammel, will arrive
in stores soon.</TE>
<TE>   The coach will have a book signing in Bloomington next month,
albeit at a shopping mall some distance from campus. A large crowd is
expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Has the fervor around Bob Knight died down?" Martin asked. "I
think it has cooled a little bit ... but I'm not certain it will ever
go away."</TE>

<DH>Engineering Texas Tech's Amazing Turnaround Has
Rehabilitated Knight's Image by Proving He's Lost None of His
Coaching Chops</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the upsides about becoming infamous in America is that it
doesn't matter how badly you mess up so long as you have a good agent
and Larry King on speed dial.</LD>
<LD>   We're the forgive-and-forget types, ready to Tammy Faye-hug our
tabloid headliners at the drop of a dime or a tear.</LD>
<LD>   So, in a year in which Monica Lewinsky signed on with HBO and
Paula Jones inked a boxing deal, we proudly welcome Bob Knight back
to ESPN SportsCenter stage.</LD>
<TE>   Dismissed as a pariah after his fit-to-be-tied firing as Indiana
basketball coach in 2000, Knight has been recast as coach at Texas
Tech, in Lubbock, heretofore known only as a launching pad for Buddy
Holly and the Crickets.</TE>
<TE>   It seems we may have underestimated an important component in
chronicling the zero-tolerance diaries that once dominated the
Knightly news.</TE>
<TE>   We became so consumed with the Loch Ness-grainy videotape that
depicted Knight choking (or did he?) one of his Indiana players, Neil
Reed; so caught up in dissecting the seemingly pathological pattern
of Knight's behavior, we somewhat whiffed on the whole picture:</TE>
<TE>   The man can really coach.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other "bad boys and girls" of lowest common denominator
fascination, Knight holds a valuable trump card: talent.</TE>
<TE>   This does not excuse Knight's anger issues, or the chair he threw
on the court against Purdue, or the cop he punched in Puerto Rico, or
the nose he once busted (his son's), or the vase he chucked at his
secretary, or the enmity he engendered.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, a year in exile distanced Knight from the noise and allowed
him to prove in hardpan isolation what even his detractors cannot
deny: that he is probably one of the three, four or five best college
basketball coaches who ever lived.</TE>
<TE>   What can you say about his 12-step recovery program at Texas Tech?
He inherited a 9-19 team and pushed it clear into a Big 12 Conference
tournament semifinal, where the Red Raiders at last swallowed a
reality pill in the form of a 40-point loss to Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's the most amazing thing I've seen in coaching, maybe
the greatest coaching job I've ever seen," legendary coach Pete
Newell said before the Kansas game.</TE>
<TE>   You knew Knight would resurface somewhere after his five-alarm
firing in 2000 following 29 seasons as Indiana coach, yet his
abdicating to Lubbock had sort of a Napoleon-to-St. Helena feel.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was supposed to disappear into an oil slick, not turn muck
into March madness.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of a couple junior college transfers, though, and
some nurturing of leftovers, Texas Tech is 23-8 and headed into the
NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Asked this week if he expected Knight to make Texas Tech a winner
this fast, retired Texas El Paso Coach Don Haskins croaked, "I've
been doing this a long time and I damn sure didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focusing on his personality flaws, people are talking
about Bob Knight The Coach again.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say this enough," said Haskins, who led UTEP, then known
as Texas Western, to a national title in 1966. "His team didn't
overachieve, it over, overachieved. I've seen three of his Indiana
teams win the national title, I thought they had good talent. But
this is the best job ever from what I've watched."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hammel, the retired Bloomington (Ind.) Herald-Times sports
editor and one of Knight's closest friends, says this was at least
Knight's most impressive coaching job since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   That year, Indiana surrendered 100 points to three opponents in an
early four-game stretch yet rallied to win the Big Ten title.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's the year Illinois and Michigan played in the Final
Four and Michigan won," Hammel offered in an interview before he fell
ill while watching Texas Tech play Friday at the Big 12 tournament.
(Hammel had an apparent diabetic seizure but is expected to recover.)</TE>
<TE>   Knight needed only time and some elbow room to regain his coaching
traction.</TE>
<TE>   Hammel, who has covered Knight since the coach arrived in
Bloomington in 1972, said context had been lost at Indiana.
Twenty-win seasons weren't good enough anymore and fans seemed fixed
on the fact Indiana hadn't made the Sweet 16 since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "It got to the point where they were sniping at him," said Hammel,
who coauthored a soon-to-be-released biography on Knight, "Knight: My
Story." "They talked about how the game had passed him by but, in
1993, he had the No. 1 team in the country. Boy, that game certainly
speeded up in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   Knight has put those man-out-of-time notions to rest; rebuilding a
program has repaired his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really enjoying basketball again," Hammel said. "Anyone who
knows it can see it in his demeanor. He's much more relaxed. I'm sure
the people at Texas Tech wouldn't consider that relaxed, because he
is intense, but it's nowhere near the same bottled-up anger he had to
live with the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   Funny how fast things change.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Knight almost busted a chair while fielding questions
at Big 12 media day, then playfully tossed it aside, saying "that's
the furthest I've thrown a chair in a long time," a reference to his
infamous 1985 chair-throwing incident against Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, after Hammel collapsed courtside, Knight rushed to his
side and, immediately after the game, went directly to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The kinder, gentler Bob, or the Bob we never allowed ourselves to
know?</TE>
<TE>   Knight's coaching legacy was secure long before his firing at
Indiana, yet this season's performance has served to amplify his
skills as one of the game's masters.</TE>
<TE>   "In coaching, he's very kind of Woodenesque," Utah Coach Rick
Majerus said. "In personality, they're dramatically different, but
not in their approach to the game."</TE>
<TE>   In the throes of "ChokeGate," Knight had become a public
caricature, obscuring how revered he was in inner circles.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave a writer a column and a cartoonist his strip for two or
three days," said Newell, one of Knight's closest friends. "But what
he really stands for, what a great teacher he is, it got lost."</TE>
<TE>   Knight always considered Newell more of an inspiration than
Wooden, but Majerus' comparison speaks volumes.</TE>
<TE>   In the February issue of Basketball Times, Wooden was asked what
separates good coaches from great ones.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest difference is in coaches that are able to get the
players under their supervision to play together as a team, and
coaches who can get their players to recognize and accept their
roles," Wooden is quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   And that, many say, is what separates Knight from his
contemporaries.</TE>
<TE>   Majerus said Knight "gets the players to see the game the way he
sees it, which is the essence of coaching."</TE>
<TE>   Just how good a coach is Knight?</TE>
<TE>   Newell, who coached California to the NCAA title in 1959, says
Knight's motion offense revolutionized the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The motion concept utilizes court spacing, picks, back-cuts,
movement and patience. The center position in the motion offense
plays the high post, and is more of a passer than inside presence.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was drawn to the concept after watching the Bill
Bradley-led Princeton teams in the 1960s, coached by Butch van Breda
Kolff. The object of the motion game is to react to what defenses do
rather than running predetermined plays.</TE>
<TE>   So many high school and college coaches have cribbed variations of
Knight's offense that he has effectively diminished the role of the
low-post center.</TE>
<TE>   Newell says it's the reason he has been in the business of
retraining centers for the NBA at his "Big Man" camps.</TE>
<TE>   Said Majerus: "A lot of people with the motion offense want to run
it but don't want to commit to it. It's a difficult thing to do at
the pro level because you don't have a five-second count, and you
have a wider lane, and there's more of a post presence. I mean, you
want to give Shaq as many touches as you can in the paint.</TE>
<TE>   "What Knight does, he gets guys to move without the ball, share
the ball and accept their roles."</TE>
<TE>   Knight does it better than most because he is demanding, a
stickler for detail and is constantly tinkering. While Knight might
sometimes act like a know-it-all, he has actually spent much of his
career scouring for knowledge and picking some of the game's greatest
brains: Newell, Clair Bee, Fred Taylor and Henry Iba.</TE>
<TE>   Knight calls these men his "cornerstones."</TE>
<TE>   Hammel recalls a summer in the early 1970s when Knight and Newell
spent many hours diagraming plays on the gym floor.</TE>
<TE>   "His sense of detail is astonishing," Hammel said. "One of the
coaches he respected was [former Cleveland Brown coach] Paul Brown.
Everything was so detailed. Nothing was an accident. With him, he's
forever tinkering."</TE>
<TE>   Knight, even in his 60s now, isn't above a long-haul drive for
insight. Last fall, he made the several-hours trek from Lubbock to El
Paso to visit Haskins.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent five, six hours, talking nothing but basketball,"
Haskins said. "I mean, he's up and out of his chair. That night at
the Holiday Inn, I was thinking, 'He needs somebody to guard right
now.' He was ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even Haskins thought Knight would struggle this season,
especially after booting three players off the team. Texas Tech,
unlike Indiana, was hardly a mecca of college basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I was actually feeling sorry for him," Haskins said. "I thought
he had two or three pretty good players, but I had no idea how much
better they were going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Knight didn't inherit a complete dust pile. Two holdovers, center
Andy Ellis and guard Andre Emmett, were talents, and Knight was able
to sign a key junior college player, forward Kasib Powell.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they really worked hard right from the beginning in
trying to do what we wanted done," Knight said in a recent conference
call. "Kids can be with you, and be really good kids, and be good
players, and have good teams, and they still get things screwed up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a game that cannot be played perfectly no matter how much
you try. It's a game of mistakes. It isn't great plays that wins
games, it's reducing mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Haskins thinks Texas Tech is playing as hard as any Knight-led
Indiana team.</TE>
<TE>   "They pick better than I've ever seen them pick," Haskins said.
"They play defense better. He [Knight] doesn't like to lose. He gets
his players that way. I can tell this bunch is listening. I can tell
the way they play."</TE>
<TE>   Majerus, considered one of the modern game's top basketball
strategists, says going against Knight is like a math major going up
against his professor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's exceptionally bright and astute," Majerus said. "And his
players become very cerebral. I played his teams a number of times
and it's always fun. It's challenging. He's a master strategist in
terms of identifying certain aspects of your play that he feels he
can disrupt or take away."</TE>
<TE>   Knight's offense has been mimicked by hundreds of coaches across
the country, and Newell says no coach has been more willing to share
with others what he has learned.</TE>
<TE>   So why is Knight better?</TE>
<TE>   "Why are some teachers better than others in the same subject?"
Newell answered. "They just have more of a gift for it. He's a
teacher, a very, very demanding teacher. There's no slippage. What he
says today he's going to say tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Hammel thinks Knight's late 1990s "slump" at Indiana was due more
to a couple of bad recruiting classes than anything Knight had lost
on his coaching fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never any less than an effort," Hammel said. "He was
just as involved in trying to do things."</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of dark days for the FOBs (Friends of Bob), that
handful of media types and coaches who walked the plank to defend
Knight even when his actions seemed indefensible.</TE>
<TE>   Hammel is unabashed in his feelings about Knight's most important
lesson in rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to see him back to where he was as a person," Hammel
said. "He's a guy who's not beset by demons at this point. He
obviously was fighting a lot of things and he's not doing that now.
Yeah, I'm happy to see that. But he's not going to become Santa Claus
overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Majerus on Knight: "Anybody who wants to be a better coach would
take something away from him."</TE>
<TE>   Haskins says if what goes around comes around, it's time to give
Bob Knight his due and his day.</TE>
<TE>   "I think those other distractions deterred from that," Haskins
said. "I never heard anybody say he couldn't coach. Even the writers
that didn't like him, they never said he couldn't do that."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 STANFORD (19-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Western Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Reluctant Pac-10 tournament participants lost to

against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Casey Jacobsen. The 6-6 junior forward scored
more than 40 points twice.</TE>

<TE>   First-round opponent: Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Hilltoppers won the Sun Belt tournament with
a come-from-behind effort against Louisiana Lafayette, but likely
would have made the field anyway. They started strong with an road
upset of Kentucky, but lost 7-footer Chris Marcus for 17 games

coaches.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Lost to Florida in first round in 2001, but this will be

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 PEPPERDINE (22-8)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Wake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Former NBA coach Paul Westphal took over last
spring, and the Waves made a splash as unofficial L.A. city champions
with victories over UCLA and USC. They split with Gonzaga in
finishing in a tie for the West Coast Conference regular-season title

after Dec. 31 and had a 15% shooting half in the Big East tournament
against Rutgers. They lost to Pittsburgh in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Troy Bell. The junior guard averaged 21 points
but proved erratic during the season.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: The Eagles were probably saved by their season sweep of
Miami. They lost to Duke, 88-78.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Lost to USC in second round last season. Reached 1994
Elite Eight under Jim O'Brien.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 CREIGHTON (22-8)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: After getting swept by Southern Illinois during

<TE>   First-round opponent: Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Aztecs upset Wyoming on a late shot and then
defeated Nevada Las Vegas on the Rebels' own court to win the
Mountain West Conference's automatic bid--beating a team they had
lost to twice in overtime.</TE>

scorer and rebounder played at L.A. City College two seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Chris Walton--one of Bill's four sons and the brother of
Arizona's Luke Walton--is a 6-9 sophomore forward who plays about 14

Grizzlies upset top-seeded Montana State in the semifinals by two
points and beat second-seeded Eastern Washington by four in the
final.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: David Bell. The junior guard is a three-point
threat who made eight of 11 in a game against Portland State.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Michael Ray Richardson shares the school scoring record
for his 40-point performance against Montana State in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Fifth appearance and first since 1997. Only victory in

<HD>Gonzaga Should Be Used to Upsets by Now</HD>
<DH>Overview: Despite being ranked sixth in the country, 'Zags
tumble all the way down to a No. 6 seeding in West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cameras were there to record the celebration.</LD>
<LD>   They got little but a cold, hard stare and a shift in his seat
from Gonzaga Coach Mark Few.</LD>
<LD>   He had just seen the NCAA selection committee try to wrest the
men's basketball tournament back from the little guys.</LD>
<TE>   Gonzaga, ranked No. 6 in the country and a veteran of the last
three Sweet 16s, hoped to be seeded No. 2 or--somewhat more
realistically--No. 3 in its region.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the 'Zags (29-3) are sixth in the power-packed West--and
could face Arizona, which won the Pacific 10 tournament, in the
second round Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That's assuming Gonzaga gets past dangerous Wyoming on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Few, skewered last week for his disdain for the West Coast
Conference tournament, held his tongue this time.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's one program that knows you have to throw out the
seedings starting tomorrow, it's us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Duke, Kansas, Maryland--and in a mild surprise--Cincinnati claimed
the No. 1 seedings when the field of 65 was announced Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Six conferences claimed 33 bids--including six from the
highly regarded Pac-10, Big 12 and Southeastern conferences but also
six from the maligned Big East.</TE>
<TE>   The major conferences also were the biggest beneficiaries of the
new system designed to keep more teams close to home in the early
rounds--giving several teams seemingly insurmountable homecourt
advantages.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State had hardly come down from the giddiness of earning
a bid before learning it will play Illinois on Friday in the United
Center in Chicago, where the Illini already played one game this
season.</TE>
<TE>   It so happens it's 15 miles from where Aztec leading scorer Randy
Holcomb grew up, so it's not all bad.</TE>
<TE>   It might also be a better fate than staying in the loaded West
regional.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati (30-3) received the No. 1 in the West even though
Oklahoma (27-4) upset No. 1-ranked Kansas in the Big 12 championship
game, which ended about an hour before the selection show.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Fowler, the new chairman of the selection committee and
athletic director at North Carolina State, said the group decided
before the game ended that an Oklahoma victory wouldn't change the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   The committee made the Sooners No. 2 in the West, giving the
region three of the top six teams in the Associated Press poll--which
isn't given much if any weight by the committee: No. 4 Oklahoma, No.
5 Cincinnati and No. 6 Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, second-ranked Maryland (26-4), No. 1 in the East
despite being upset in the Atlantic Coast Conference semifinals, is
the only team in that region ranked among the AP's top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Duke (29-3), in the South, must contend with Pittsburgh and
Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   In the Midwest, Kansas (29-3) has Oregon--which earned a
surprising No. 2 seeding--and Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   The West is difficult throughout. It also includes Arizona, UCLA,
Miami, Missouri, Ohio State, Arizona and Xavier.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I hadn't had enough time to look at it," said
Fowler, when told six of the top seven teams in the West won tough
conference tournaments--Cincinnati, Ohio State, Gonzaga, Arizona,
Xavier and Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we felt it was four balanced regions."</TE>
<TE>   If there was a message sent Sunday it was a thumb of the nose at
the Associated Press rankings and a strong allegiance to the
controversial RPI rankings that perpetuate the strength of the major
conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Fowler said RPI is only one factor, but the committee hewed
closely to it in many seeding decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga's sixth seeding, for instance, suggested the committee
considered it one of the 20th-24th best teams in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga's RPI was No. 21.</TE>
<TE>   "I do remember they had 12 of their wins versus teams with 200 or
worse RPIs," Fowler said.</TE>
<TE>   That's the West Coast Conference factor.</TE>
<TE>   "They lost to Illinois and Marquette who were four and five
seeds," Fowler said. "So strength of schedule a little bit, but the
teams they lost to."</TE>
<TE>   Teams Gonzaga beat that are in the field are St. John's, Texas and
Pepperdine (Gonzaga was 2-1 against the Waves).</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga and Pepperdine--which made the field as a 10th-seeded
team--are among the so-called mid-major schools that have heeded the
NCAA's advice to schedule tough nonconference games.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are sometimes cited for the ones they don't win.</TE>
<TE>   In the major conferences, that schedule is built in.</TE>
<TE>   (The RPI formula is essentially the average of 25% of a team's
winning percentage, 50% of its opponents' record and 25% of its
opponents' opponents' record. It does not factor in home-road and
conference-nonconference issues.)</TE>
<TE>   That helped account for Boston College--20-11 with an RPI of
42--making the field despite losing four of its last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles' only impressive victories were a sweep of conference
rival Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri (21-11, RPI 54) made it despite losing five of its last
nine, with only one victory over a top 25 team--Oklahoma State--since
November.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte (18-11, RPI 37) had two conference games against
Cincinnati and two against Marquette. Its win over Marquette was its
only marquee victory of the season. (Note: Charlotte Athletic
Director Judy Rose is on the selection committee.)</TE>
<TE>   So-called mid-major teams hoping the effect of Gonzaga's recent
success and their own scheduling might get them in--Butler (25-5, RPI
77), Bowling Green (24-8, RPI 58) and Ball State (19-11, RPI
78)--ended up on the outside looking in.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine--which played one of the five toughest nonconference
schedules in the country and beat USC and UCLA--and Southern
Illinois, which won 26 games, made the cut.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be everyone wondered what some 25-5 mid-major might do
if it made the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Now people have an idea.</TE>
<TE>   Ball State upset Kansas and UCLA in November, but didn't play well
enough the rest of the way and lost in the Mid-American semifinals to
Bowling Green, perhaps knocking both out because it was too hard to
choose between them.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like you could put us up against some of the teams in the
tournament and you could make a pretty good case for us," Bowling
Green Coach Dan Dakich said.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at some of the teams and I see 18, 19 wins. Granted,
there's different levels, I understand."</TE>
<TE>   And even those teams that made the field will find themselves
playing early-round games in front of large partisan crowds.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to allow families and fans to attend games and keep
students from missing so much class crossing the country to play one
or two games.</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the results.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh, the nation's seventh-ranked team, is seeded third in
the South but will play its first two games in Pittsburgh in Mellon
Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Texas, sixth in the Midwest, will play Boston College in Dallas on
Friday--potentially giving the Longhorns a shot at a third-seeded
Mississippi State team that is supposed to be the favorite two days
later in front of a burnt-orange crowd at American Airlines Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski was taking a wait-and-see attitude.</TE>
<TE>   He needn't have worried.</TE>
<TE>   He's playing Winthrop in Greenville, S.C.--not far from Rock Hill,
where Winthrop is located.</TE>
<TE>   Winthrop, however, has never won an NCAA tournament game.</TE>

<TE>   THE BREAKDOWN</TE>
<TE>   FORWARD: Pepperdine's Jimmy Miggins and Boomer Brazzle are steady
scorers who thrive inside or outside. They'll face an equally
athletic pair in Wake Forest's Antwan Scott and Josh Howard. The
6-foot-8 Scott is regarded as the best dunker in the ACC. The 6-6
Howard, like Brazzle, is a three-point shooting threat.</TE>
<TE>   CENTER: Cedric Suitt, a 6-11 senior, holds all of Pepperdine's
blocked-shot records and is a defensive force. But Suitt isn't much
of an offensive threat and has a tendency to get into foul trouble.
Darius Songaila, though listed as a forward, is the closest thing
Wake Forest has to a post player. The 6-9, 245-pound senior, a
four-year starter, leads the Demon Deacons in scoring and rebounding.
Will Kimble, who has played well in recent games, backs up Suitt.</TE>
<TE>   GUARD: Point guard Devin Montgomery is Pepperdine's hottest
offensive player. The junior led the Waves in scoring in the WCC
tournament, averaging 15.7 points and making eight of 13 three-point
shots. Freshman Terrance Johnson will be trying to regain his outside
touch after struggling in the WCC tournament. Wake Forest's Craig
Dawson led ACC players in three-point shooting percentage (42.8%),
making 90 of 210 attempts. Broderick Hicks and Taron Downey have
split point guard duties for the Demon Deacons.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING: Pepperdine's Paul Westphal and Wake Forest's Skip
Prosser, each in their first season, favor an uptempo style of play.
That formula has worked for Prosser, who guided Xavier to four NCAA
tournament appearances.</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: Wake Forest has played arguably the toughest
schedule in the nation, which partly explains why the Demon Deacons
have lost six of their last nine games. Pepperdine has won 17 of its
last 19 games, but is not as battle tested as its opponent. It's a
pick 'em.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Undefeated, unchallenged and unabashedly the favorite to win the
women's NCAA tournament, that's the University of Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   Whether this will make for an interesting tournament, that's what
will play out in the next three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   When John Wooden's UCLA teams were overwhelming favorites, there
was always great drama in watching a Dayton, or some other unlikely
challenger, come close to an upset.</LD>
<TE>   So either we'll have that--or a dull exercise in watching
unappreciated greatness.</TE>
<TE>   We already know what's expected.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN did a quick poll after the women's draw was released. It
asked who had the best chance of upsetting the 33-0
Huskies--Tennessee, Oklahoma, Duke, Stanford, or nobody.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody was easily the top choice.</TE>
<TE>   And a smart choice. The Huskies have won their 33 games by an
average margin of 37 points.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact UConn has four seniors in the lineup that are playing
with great efficiency and great confidence, yes, I'm not surprised at
that result," Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt said. "Certainly strange
things can happen in the postseason. Should that happen to UConn? The
likelihood is not very strong. But they have to show up and play like
everybody else and they have a huge target on them.</TE>
<TE>   "But, yes, I view this tournament as UConn's to lose."</TE>
<TE>   That can be a bad thing. It's not good for national buzz or for TV
ratings or for drawing the interest of the casual fan if UConn
continues to win its tournament games by an average of 37 points.</TE>
<TE>   Last year there was excitement created around women's basketball
because there was a fabulous tournament.</TE>
<TE>   When a Midwest Catholic college, Xavier, upset Tennessee, people
noticed. When Jackie Stiles, a pony-tailed gym rat with great court
sense and a sweet shot, dragged Southwest Missouri State to the Final
Four, people noticed. When Notre Dame broke the Tennessee-UConn
dominance by winning its first title, and did it not by beating UConn
or Tennessee but Purdue, people noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Singular greatness can be a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   What will get people to notice this tournament?</TE>
<TE>   An upset of UConn.</TE>
<TE>   What will get people talking about this tournament? How to beat
UConn. Can UConn be beaten? Why can't somebody beat UConn?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's sustained greatness under Wooden was a good thing for the
college game. Other teams wanted to get good enough to beat UCLA.
Fans were created just because they wanted to root against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Geno Auriemma, UConn's demanding, dominating coach, said that
UConn played "seven or eight teams this year that could have beaten
us." He said that with a straight face on national television, though
he didn't share which of those teams that was losing to him by 37
points were the ones he figured might beat UConn.</TE>
<TE>   But if it seems this tournament is back to the same old, same old,
that's not totally true.</TE>
<TE>   While UConn, the No. 1 seed in the Mideast Regional, is expected
to romp, there does seem to be a bit of a guard change.</TE>
<TE>   For only the third time in 15 years, Tennessee didn't get a No. 1
seed. The Vols were slotted No. 2 in the Midwest region. As if that
wasn't enough of a slap in the face, the No. 1 seed in that region is
Vanderbilt, Southeastern Conference rivals of the Vols.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt finished three games behind the Lady Vols in the SEC
regular season but the teams split their league games and Vandy won
the conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised to get a No. 2 seed," Summitt said. "We had the
No. 1 RPI and the toughest schedule in the country. I could tell our
team was disappointed because they expected, and rightfully so, to
get a No. 1 seed."</TE>
<TE>   The Lady Vols were upset by Louisiana State in an SEC tournament
semifinal, leading Summitt to say that "this speaks to the amount of
emphasis placed on conference tournaments." If you're looking for
omens, in 1997 the Lady Vols were seeded No. 3 and won the
championship; in 1987 the Lady Vols were seeded No. 2 and won the
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since 1993, Louisiana Tech was not seeded among
the top 16 teams. Oklahoma received a No. 1 seed for the first time.
Things do change.</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuous by their absence in the field are Pacific 10 teams.
While the Pac-10 men placed six teams in the tournament, the women
have only two.</TE>
<TE>   And apparently the Pac-10 is so lightly regarded that a loss in
the finals of the Pac-10 tournament to Arizona State cost 30-2
Stanford a No. 1 seed. The Cardinal is No. 2 in the West, behind
Oklahoma. Arizona State, with the automatic bid, is the other Pac-10
school in the field.</TE>
<TE>   This should be an embarrassment to the conference. While it's nice
that Southern California can produce talented players, it's too bad
they feel they have to travel across the country to do their best
work in college.</TE>
<TE>   It's disappointing that Diana Taurasi, who played at Chino Don
Lugo High, needed to head to UConn. It's too bad that Loree Moore of
Harbor City Narbonne High felt it necessary to head to Tennessee or
that Santa Margarita High's Venessa Ferragamo preferred Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   And there's something wrong when only Pepperdine from Southern
California made the tournament. No USC, no UCLA, no Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   So now local women's college basketball fans can understand how
men's college basketball fans around the country felt. Won't somebody
beat UConn, please?</TE>

<TE>   BREAKDOWN</TE>
<TE>   FORWARD: The human pogo stick that is Jerry Dupree (6-7, 200) also
has a wingspan that allows him to block shots and play as though he
were three inches taller. His inspired play in the Pacific 10
Conference tournament allowed the Trojans to move the rugged but
sweet-shooting David Bluthenthal (6-7, 220) to power forward. The
Seahawks' forwards, Anthony Terrell (6-7, 230) and Ed Williams (6-6,
215), are an athletic and extremely active duo, but should have their
hands full with the Trojans' inside-outside game.</TE>
<TE>   CENTER: Sam Clancy (6-7, 240) and his 17 double-doubles moved to
the post when Dupree moved into the Trojan starting lineup, an
adjustment that turned USC into a quicker, albeit smaller, team. The
Seahawks also have an undersized center in Craig Callahan (6-8, 250)
who will try to lure Clancy outside of his comfort zone and to the
perimeter with his 39.1% three-point shooting.</TE>
<TE>   GUARD: Brandon Granville, a fourth-year starter, should make a
point to rattle sophomore point guard Tim Burnette, who has started
only 10 games this year. Errick Craven will have his sound defense
tested by Brett Blizzard, the Seahawks' leader in scoring and assists
who also has no conscience when it comes to shooting the long ball.
He launched 213 shots from beyond the three-point stripe.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING: Henry Bibby, in his sixth season, is taking his third
team to the NCAAs. Jerry Wainwright, in his eighth season, took the
Seahawks to the NCAAs in 2000, when they lost to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: USC's smothering defense should prove too much for
the Seahawks. After playing three consecutive days of full-court
pressure defense in the Pac-10 tournament, the Trojans tired against
Arizona. They should be back at full swarm.</TE>

<HD>Waves Face a Big Wake</HD>
<DH>Pepperdine: Although school is 0-11 against ACC opponents,
Coach Paul Westphal is pleased with draw against No. 7-seeded Demon
Deacons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a temporary glitch, it was a picture-perfect Sunday in Malibu
for the Pepperdine men's basketball team.</LD>
<LD>   With clear, blue skies outside, players and coaches beamed sunny
smiles inside the university's Heritage Hall when it was announced on
television that the Waves will play Wake Forest in the first round of
the NCAA tournament on Thursday at Arco Arena in Sacramento. Tipoff
is at 11:30 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The large screen went blank for a few minutes after junior guard
Mike Westphal, son of Coach Paul Westphal, accidentally unplugged the
projector. But the picture was restored in time for Pepperdine (22-8)
to learn it was seeded No. 10 in the Midwest Regional.</LD>
<TE>   Wake Forest (20-12), the only team in the nation that has played
all four of the tournament's top-seeded teams, is seeded No. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't get any better than that," said Pepperdine center
Cedric Suitt, a fifth-year senior who will be playing in his second
NCAA tournament. "When you get a chance to play a high-caliber team
like [Wake Forest], you really get a chance to prove yourself, like
we've been doing all year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a great matchup."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Westphal, who guided the Waves to a share of the West Coast
Conference regular-season championship in his first season in Malibu,
was pleased with his team's placement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real happy about being seeded 10th," Westphal said. "I think
that's a credit to what our guys accomplished this year. I think it's
really nice that we get to play in Sacramento. A lot of our fans will
be able to appear at the game."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine impressed the selection committee with a demanding
nonconference schedule that included victories over UCLA and No. 22
USC, a conference win over No. 6 Gonzaga and a strong finish to the
regular season. The Waves have won 17 of their last 19 games, losing
only to Gonzaga in conference play and in last Monday's WCC
tournament final.</TE>
<TE>   Like Pepperdine, Wake Forest has played eight teams in the NCAA
tournament, with victories over North Carolina Wilmington, Marquette
and North Carolina State. The Demon Deacons suffered their third loss
to Duke, 79-64, in a semifinal of the Atlantic Coast Conference
tournament on Saturday. They lost twice to Maryland and once each to
Kansas and Cincinnati, the other top-seeded teams in the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest was ranked as high as No. 14 this season, but fell out
of the Associated Press poll last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we won't be favored," Westphal said. "We're playing a
highly rated ACC team. But when you get in the NCAA tournament,
you're always going to play a high-caliber team. That's part of the
deal. That's good.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited to be there and hope we can play one of our good
games. If we do that, we like our chances."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine is making its fourth consecutive postseason appearance.
The Waves last played in the NCAA tournament in 2000, when they ran
Indiana and Bob Knight out of the gym, 77-57, in the East Regional in
Buffalo, N.Y., before losing to Oklahoma State, 75-67, in the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves don't have much of a track record against ACC teams.
They are 0-11 against the ACC, including NCAA tournament losses to
North Carolina State in 1983, Duke in 1985 and Maryland in 1986.
Pepperdine and Wake Forest have never played. The Waves last played
an ACC team in the 1989-90 season, losing at North Carolina, 95-69.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted by history, Pepperdine's players say they are looking
forward to showing that a WCC team can compete against an opponent
from arguably the nation's toughest conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the ACC gets all the hoopla," said forward Jimmy Miggins,
the Waves' leading scorer with a 15-point average. "But we're a good
team and we're going to prove that.</TE>
<TE>   "The West Coast Conference doesn't get that much [publicity], but
we're going to come in and show them that we're as good a team as
they are."</TE>
<TE>   Said Boomer Brazzle, Pepperdine's other starting forward: "We feel
good, confident. We're just going to go and give our best."</TE>
<TE>   While Pepperdine enters the NCAA tournament after a long spell of
prosperity, Wake Forest is reeling a bit.</TE>
<TE>   The Demon Deacons have lost six of their last nine games, and
Steve Lepore, a key reserve guard and one of the team's best
three-point shooters, is out for the season after suffering a knee
injury in the ACC tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, four of Wake Forest's recent losses have come against
Cincinnati, Duke (twice) and Maryland, so the team's late-season
downturn isn't as severe as it might appear.</TE>
<TE>   The Demon Deacons, under first-year Coach Skip Prosser, formerly
the coach at Xavier, tied for third in the ACC. They lost in the
first round of the NCAA tournament last year to Butler, 79-63.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine will have to contend with Wake Forest's strong front
line, featuring 6-foot-9, 245-pound Darius Songaila, a four-year
starter and a member of the Lithuanian national team that won the
bronze medal in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.</TE>

<HD>Aztecs End a 17-Year Drought</HD>
<DH>San Diego State: Long considered a sleeping giant,
Fisher-led team heads to Midwest as Mountain West tournament
champion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How long has it been since San Diego State was in the NCAA
tournament?</LD>
<LD>   Well, let's see ...</LD>
<LD>   Tony Gwynn, who once played basketball as well as baseball for the
Aztecs, still only had 362 major league hits.</LD>
<TE>   Marshall Faulk, who was in the stands Saturday night in Las Vegas
when San Diego State won the Mountain West tournament championship,
didn't have the first of his nearly 15,000 NFL rushing yards. (He was
12.)</TE>
<TE>   The year was 1985. It has been 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the school long considered a sleeping giant in the
basketball world is awake, three seasons after Steve Fisher took over
as coach.</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs (21-11) will play Illinois (24-8) in a Midwest Regional
game Friday in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping not just to go, but to go and win," said Fisher, who
knows something about winning in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   He won the 1989 title at Michigan as an interim coach, and took
the Wolverines to the title game again in 1992 and '93 during the Fab
Five Era with Chris Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Before Fisher arrived in San Diego in 1999, the Aztecs had only
one winning season in the previous 14.</TE>
<TE>   They were 5-23 his first season, 14-14 the next.</TE>
<TE>   They started this season in the Red Raider Classic in Lubbock,
Texas, as Bob Knight made his debut.</TE>
<TE>   They played the Red Raiders the second night, and when they lost
to a team that had been 9-19 the season before, things looked bleak.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knew then how good Texas Tech was.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knew how good San Diego State could be either, when it was
2-5 in conference in mid-January. Now the Aztecs have won nine of
their last 10, the only loss in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken huge steps in the last six weeks," Fisher said. "Now,
we're in the spot where everybody wants to be."</TE>
<TE>   They have Randy Holcomb, a senior forward who started his career
at Fresno State, then transferred to Los Angeles City College and now
gets to go home to Chicago after a 20-point, 12-rebound performance
in the title game against Nevada Las Vegas that made him tournament
most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   "To go home and to play Illinois, a school I wanted to play for
out of high school, it's unreal," Holcomb said.</TE>
<TE>   There's point guard Deandre Moore, a junior from Compton who had
made only 16 of 36 free throws all season. He made four of four down
the stretch against UNLV.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Al Faux, the swaggering senior walk-on from Crenshaw
High. He sank the jumper with 19 seconds left to upset Wyoming in a
tournament semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   And there's junior guard Tony Bland, who used to play at Syracuse.
Now he's still playing, and Syracuse isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher is in, and Michigan's not.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Walton will play for Arizona, and now his brother Chris, a
sophomore forward who comes off the Aztec bench, is in too.</TE>
<TE>   And San Diego State, which last season was only in as host of an
NCAA regional at Cox Arena, finally gets to put on the uniforms and
play.</TE>

<LD>No. 1 DUKE (29-3)</LD>
<LD>   First-round opponent: Winthrop.</LD>
<LD>   Season in brief: Any talk of invincibility was halted by the
defending national champions' startling loss at Florida State
followed by losses at Maryland and Virginia, although the Blue Devils
won their unprecedented fourth consecutive ACC tournament title. Last
season's championship team also lost three regular-season games.</LD>
<TE>   Player to watch: Jason Williams. The 6-2 junior guard is the
favorite for national player of the year, and some expect him to be a
Stephon Marbury-type or Allen Iverson-type player when he joins the
NBA next season.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: At 6-9, forward Mike Dunleavy has grown three inches since
arriving at Duke--and is six inches taller than his father, the
former NBA player and coach by the same name.</TE>

<TE>   First-round opponent: Florida Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Crimson Tide won the regular-season
Southeastern Conference title, clinching with victories over Florida
and Auburn, but lost in the tournament final to Mississippi State.
Alabama rose to a top 10 ranking after early struggles that included
road losses to Missouri and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Erwin Dudley. The 6-8 junior forward had 14
double-doubles during the regular season and was the SEC player of
the year</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Coach Mark Gottfried was a senior guard on Alabama's last
SEC championship team, in 1987. He later became a UCLA assistant
coach.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: A tournament regular under Wimp Sanderson in the 1980s
and early 1990s, Alabama is in the field for the first time since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 PITTSBURGH (27-5)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Central Connecticut State.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: This surprise team broke into the top 10, set a
school record for victories and earned Ben Howland nominations for
coach of the year. The Panthers were one of the nation's best
defensive teams, allowing only about 60 points a game. They lost to
Notre Dame twice and had double-overtime setbacks to Miami and
Connecticut, the latter coming in the Big East tournament final.
Brandin Knight sprained his right knee in the Big East tournament
final, but is OK to play.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Knight. The 6-foot junior point guard is the
brother of Brevin Knight, an NBA player and former Stanford star
point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Howland, who guided Northern Arizona to the NCAA
tournament in 1998, is a former UC Santa Barbara assistant who was a
standout player at Cerritos High in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: First appearance since 1993, but made the field six
times in the 1980s. Reached the Elite Eight in 1974 and the Final
Four in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 USC (22-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: North Carolina Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Trojans roared into the Pac-10 tournament
with a 25-point victory over Stanford before losing to Arizona in the
championship game. With three seniors who played on last season's
Elite Eight team--Sam Clancy, Brandon Granville and David
Bluthenthal--USC is tournament-tested. The Trojans had a nine-game
winning streak at one point, but stumbled in early nonconference
games to Fresno State and Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Clancy. The 6-7 senior forward was the Pac-10
player of the year after recording a double-double in 17 of 28 games
and 11 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: If Henry Bibby ever reaches the Final Four, he will join a
group of six coaches who have played and coached in it--Dean Smith,
Bob Knight and Billy Donovan among them.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Reached the Elite Eight last year before losing to
eventual champion Duke. This marks the Trojans' first repeat
appearance since 1991 and '92 under George Raveling.</TE>

<TE>   No. 5 INDIANA (20-11)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Hoosiers started 7-5 with losses to Southern
Illinois and Butler, but recovered to earn a share of the Big Ten
title with three other teams. They won only four of their last eight
games.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Jared Jeffries. The 6-9 sophomore forward was the
Big Ten player of the year and the conference's leading shot-blocker,
but he has been bothered by a nagging ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Indiana hasn't reached a regional final since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Three NCAA championships, in 1976, 1981 and 1987, all
under Bob Knight. Upset by Kent State in first round last year in
Mike Davis' first season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 CALIFORNIA (22-8)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Defeated UCLA in the Pac-10 tournament before
losing to Arizona in the semifinals. The sometimes-erratic Golden
Bears contended for the Pac-10 regular-season title until the final
weekend, but finished with a stunning 46-point loss at Arizona. The
defense-oriented Bears were 17-1 at home--defeating Stanford, Oregon,
USC and UCLA--but only 4-6 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Joe Shipp. The 6-5 junior forward has been Cal's
most consistent scorer, though freshman forward Amit Tamir--with his
European-style skills--had the biggest scoring output of the season
with a 39-point game against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Tamir, a native of Israel, was forced to sit out the first
eight games for playing with professionals there.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Lost to Fresno State in first round last season after
three-year absence. Won 1959 title under Pete Newell and lost in NCAA
final in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 OKLAHOMA STATE (23-8)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: A hot start that included a victory over
Cincinnati helped the Cowboys reach as high as No. 5 in the rankings.
Leading scorer Maurice Baker was hampered by a severe ankle sprain
through most of their 10-6 Big 12 season as the Cowboys lost by 22 to
Texas Tech in conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Baker. Guard's fitness might have a lot to do
with Cowboys' fate.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Eddie Sutton's 22 tournament appearances put in him one
ahead of Syracuse's Jim Boeheim for second behind Lute Olson among
active coaches.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Made 1995 Final Four under Eddie Sutton, losing in the
semifinals to eventual champion UCLA. Won back-to-back titles in 1945
and '46 under Henry Iba.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 NOTRE DAME (21-10)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Irish survived the early departure of Troy
Murphy to the NBA rather well. Notre Dame defeated Pittsburgh twice
and was a 20-point winner over St. John's in the Big East
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Chris Thomas. The 6-1 freshman point guard played
all 60 minutes in Notre Dame's quadruple overtime victory over
Georgetown--and finished with only five turnovers to go with 22
points and 12 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Leading scorer Ryan Humphrey, a 6-8 senior forward,
reached the 1999 Sweet 16 as a player for Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Returned to tournament under Mike Brey last season for
first time since the Digger Phelps era. This is the 26th appearance
for Notre Dame, which reached the Final Four in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 CHARLOTTE (18-11)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Nothing scintillating, just another solid resume
in Conference USA and beyond. Key victories included games against
Marquette and Memphis. The 49ers played Indiana, Temple, Florida and
Miami in nonconference games but didn't win any of them. They also
fell to Cincinnati for a third time this season in the Conference USA
tournament semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Jobey Thomas.The 6-4 senior guard with a
quick-release shot had a five-game streak with at least five
three-pointers and averages 19 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: The nickname 49ers is said to come from the school's
proximity to Hwy. 49.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Fifth appearance in six years, and ninth overall. Lost
to Illinois in second round last season. Made Final Four in 1977 with
Cedric "Cornbread" Maxwell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 KENT STATE (27-5)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Started sluggishly under new Coach Stan Heath
after Gary Waters left for Rutgers. But the Golden Flashes hit their
stride with an 18-game winning streak, the most recent victory a
70-59 win over Bowling Green in the Mid-American tournament final.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Trevor Huffman. The 6-1 senior guard scored 24
points in the NCAA first-round upset of Indiana last season.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Kent State was the school that was site of the infamous
1970 National Guard shootings in which four students were killed
during an antiwar protest.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Golden Flashes upset Indiana in the first round last
season before losing to Cincinnati. Third appearance overall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 PENNSYLVANIA (25-6)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: California.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Played in unprecedented three-way playoff for the
Ivy League title in what amounted to a mini-tournament for the only
conference that doesn't hold a tournament. The Quakers handily
defeated Yale to earn the conference bid. Highlights of the season
included victories over Philadelphia rivals Villanova, Temple and St.
Joseph's.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Ugonna Onyekwe. The 6-8 junior forward is a
powerful inside player and the team's leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Cornell was the last team besides Penn or Princeton to win
the Ivy League title, in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: The Quakers have made 19 appearances, with Penn and
Princeton dominating the Ivy League conference championship. Reached
1979 Final Four, losing to Magic Johnson's Michigan State team. Only
victory since was a 1994 upset of Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 UTAH (21-8)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Utes played in the National Invitation
Tournament last year after Coach Rick Majerus missed most of the
season on medical and personal leave. This season, Utah hit a
midseason stride that included a 13-game winning streak. They were
only 4-4 down the stretch before losing to Nevada Las Vegas in the
semifinals of the Mountain West tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Britton Johnsen. The slender 6-9 junior forward
has eye-catching ability as an inside-outside player and was voted
conference player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Some of the Ute players had to move out of their dorm
rooms to make way for athletes in the Olympic Village in Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Made Final Four in 1998, losing to Kentucky in the title
game. Won 1944 NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 N.C. WILMINGTON (22-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: USC.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: This isn't exactly the University of North
Carolina school that usually makes the field. The Seahawks earned a
bid by defeating Virginia Commonwealth in the Colonial Athletic Assn.
tournament--a year after losing the final to George Mason in a 35-33
game that was the second-lowest scoring game since the shot clock was
introduced in college basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Brett Blizzard. The 6-3 junior guard was the

defeating Quinnipiac in Northeast tournament final--their 19th
victory in a row. A key result was a 66-44 loss to Oklahoma, in
opening game of Preseason NIT.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Corsley Edwards. The 6-9 senior center was on the
NCAA team that almost upset Iowa State two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: The Northeast Conference has never had a team win an NCAA
tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Second appearance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 FLORIDA ATLANTIC (19-11)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: This team looks a tad dangerous after the way it
played to defeat Lefty Driesell's Georgia State team in the Atlantic
Sun final. Program is on the rise after winning only seven games last
season and a mere two the season before. Cautionary result: Lost to
Miami, 74-48.</TE>

South Florida, Brown averages 17 points, nine rebounds and two
blocks.</TE>

64-Game, 21-Day Frenzy</HD>
<DH>Bruins Are Ready to Erase Memory of Regular Season</DH>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Gadzuric was so excited he began thinking in Dutch. Billy Knight
let out the breath he had been holding for what seemed like hours.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to say how Matt Barnes, Jason Kapono and Rico Hines felt
because they bolted shortly after the NCAA tournament pairings were
announced.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of the guys are still salty and chapped," Coach Steve Lavin
said. "They know they need to show fire and competitive spirit to
accomplish something now."</LD>
<TE>   UCLA (19-11), seeded No. 8 in the West Regional, will play No. 9
Mississippi (20-10) in Pittsburgh on Friday. The winner will face No.
1 Cincinnati, assuming the Bearcats defeat No. 16 Boston University
in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi is pleased the game is not in Sacramento, the closest
venue to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, so are the suddenly curmudgeonly Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need distractions," Gadzuric said. "It never matters
where we are shipped off to. Once we land, we're just trying to find
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "They accepted us in the tournament and that's a great opportunity
right there. Everybody has a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   "We have that chance and so do the other 46 teams."</TE>
<TE>   Reminded that there are actually 64 other teams in the tournament,
the native of the Netherlands said he transposed the numbers because
in Dutch they are expressed beginning with the lowest digit.</TE>
<TE>   By any count, leaving the state sounds great to the Bruins, who
don't mind escaping the avalanche of criticism caused by their recent
poor play.</TE>
<TE>   "We can be less concerned about getting tickets for friends and
entertaining people, and more concerned about preparing to play good
basketball," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   "In my six years, we've always played outside our geographical
region."</TE>
<TE>   And have usually done well. UCLA is 9-5 in the tournament under
Lavin, advancing to the Sweet 16 four times and the round of eight
once, absolving regular-season transgressions along the way.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the hole dug by eight consecutive weeks of going 1-1
and a first-round exit in the Pacific 10 Conference tournament is so
deep that the Bruins were sweating out the selection telecast.</TE>
<TE>   "They announced the West Region last and we kept seeing the names
and we weren't named," Knight said. "It's good to be picked. It gave
us a whole new lift on our season. We could easily be out of the
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its lowest seeding since 1993, UCLA didn't get a bad draw.
Mississippi finished sixth in the Southeastern Conference, lost six
of its last 10 and fell in the first round of the conference
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not playing them in their backyard," Rebel Coach Rod Barnes
said. "I'm glad we aren't playing them in Sacramento. Pittsburgh is
as neutral as you can possibly get."</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi plays well at home, going 13-1 in Oxford, Miss.,
including an 8-0 SEC mark. But the Rebels were 1-7 in SEC road games.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes has done well in his four years at the helm. The Rebels
made the NCAA tournament in his first two seasons, missed out after
going 19-14 in 2000, then made a run to the Sweet 16 last season with
three freshmen playing prominent roles, losing to Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Those freshmen--Justin Reed, David Sanders and Aaron Harper--have
developed into steady sophomores and are complemented by Jason
Harrison, a playmaking 5-foot-5 senior point guard, and junior
forward Derrick Allen.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels are strong on defense, holding opponents to 63.8 points
a game, and are the best three-point shooting team in the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   But they lack a true center. Gadzuric might be unstoppable against
6-8 forwards Reed and Allen.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-11 senior has played well of late, averaging 14.0 points and
9.3 rebounds in Pac-10 games while shooting 58.2%.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan's the X-factor," Bruin assistant Jim Saia said. "If he plays
well, like he did in last year's tournament, we can go a long way."</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric had 14 points and 13 rebounds in the first-round victory
against Hofstra and 16 points and 14 rebounds in the second-round
victory over Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   "We can beat any team in America as we proved [by beating No. 1
Kansas]," Gadzuric said. "We have to show we are a good team. We
can't turn the ball over and we have to convert our free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "We got an opponent who I hear has had a season a lot like ours.
We need to play smart and real hard."</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi began the season 11-2, but padded its record with
victories over Morris Brown, Louisiana Monroe, Tennessee Martin,
Arkansas Pine Bluff and David Lipscomb.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels split with Alabama, which UCLA defeated. The only other
common opponent is South Carolina, which UCLA beat at the Maui
Invitational, 89-77. Mississippi split against the Gamecocks, winning
at Oxford and losing, 69-67, Thursday in the first round of the SEC
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got one last opportunity to start over and make something
positive out of this season," Knight said. "That's the way we'll go
about it, fighting hard because it's our last chance."</TE>

<TE>   THE BREAKDOWN</TE>
<TE>   FORWARD: UCLA's Matt Barnes has a difficult matchup at power
forward against 6-foot-8, 230-pound Justin Reed, the Rebels' leading
scorer and rebounder. Reed, a sophomore, will probably spend time
double-teaming center Dan Gadzuric, however. Barnes should be able to
get open shots from the perimeter, although until scoring 15 points
against California in the first round of the Pac-10 tournament, he
has been cold lately. Jason Kapono, UCLA's leading scorer, will be
matched against 6-7 sophomore Aaron Harper, who leads Mississippi
with 78 three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   CENTER: Gadzuric could be the dominant force because Mississippi
does not have a true center. Forwards Derrick Allen and Reed are the
tallest Rebel starters at 6-8, and 6-9 Richard Kirklin is the only
reserve with any height.</TE>
<TE>   GUARD: Point guard is the most intriguing matchup, with 5-5 Rebel
senior Jason Harrison going against 6-6 Bruin freshman Cedric
Bozeman. Harrison is the type of quick penetrator that has given
Bozeman fits. At the other guard, UCLA's Billy Knight and
Mississippi's David Sanders appear even.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING: Steve Lavin clearly is not getting the most out of the
current team. Barnes has led the Rebels to the dance three of his
four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: The team that shakes its doldrums and plays an
inspired 40 minutes will win.</TE>

<HD>Gauchos Draw Leader of the Pac</HD>
<DH>Santa Barbara: Making its first NCAA tournament appearance
in 12 years, UCSB faces third-seeded Arizona.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOLETA</DL>
<LD>In a restaurant here on Selection Sunday, the mood was typically
relaxed--except in one section of the place, where about 100 UC Santa
Barbara men's basketball players, coaches and fans nervously waited
and watched television, awaiting their NCAA tournament fate.</LD>
<LD>   For them, the only respite from tension came in not drawing
Kentucky or Florida.</LD>
<LD>   As it came down to the final few pairings, Santa Barbara's game
still had not been announced. Nerve-racking anticipation gave way to
jubilation when the Gauchos found out they would play Arizona on
Thursday in their first NCAA tournament game in 12 years.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Barbara and Arizona, which haven't met since 1980, will play
at Albuquerque. Santa Barbara earned its automatic berth by defeating
Utah State, 60-56, Saturday night in the Big West Conference
tournament final.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos (20-10) know they are big underdogs as a 14th seed
against the third-seeded Wildcats (22-9), but it hasn't dimmed their
enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, I'm kind of happy that we got this seed," sophomore
forward Branduinn Fullove said. "I think Arizona is a great draw for
us. We don't have to be better than those guys the whole season. We
just have to be better for one game."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara, which has won 20 games for the first time in 10
years, is used to Pac-10 competition, having played USC the past five
seasons, UCLA last year and Stanford the year before.</TE>
<TE>   They can thank the NCAA basketball committee for opting to put
higher seeds in regional sites closer to home in the first two
rounds. But Arizona just plowed through the rugged Pac-10 tournament
and Santa Barbara hasn't beaten a Pac-10 team since defeating Oregon
in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "We know their players just by watching them on TV," junior
forward Mark Hull said. "That is a great conference. But we felt we
were in all of those games. We know what's in store for us."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara Coach Bob Williams, an unabashed admirer of Arizona
Coach Lute Olson, is looking forward to the coaching matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a legend in the game," Williams said. "When you say Lute,
you know who he is. It's just like Coach K [Mike Krzyzewski]. He's
one of those guys you can call by one name and you know exactly who
you are coaching against.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy has probably coached in more NCAA tournament games than
I've coached Division I games."</TE>
<TE>   Like many college basketball fans trying to forecast the
tournament brackets, restaurant goers here tried to guess where Santa
Barbara would be sent. Many figured the Gauchos would be playing a
third or fourth seed. During the NCAA selection telecast, several
groans rang out when Kentucky, Florida or Illinois flashed on the
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Even the momentary thought of playing top-seeded Duke had the
crowd holding its collective breath, though it would have been highly
unlikely the Gauchos would have been a 16th seed.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who was hoping the Gauchos would draw Gonzaga, shot a
quick look at his players after hearing those groans.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking at the reactions of some of our guys," he said. "I
was a little disappointed they were relieved they didn't get some of
those teams."</TE>
<TE>   Hull is happy Santa Barbara got the big test it did.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to play against one of the big schools," he said.
"That's what is fun about the tournament. You want to test yourself
against those schools."</TE>

<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No. 1 CINCINNATI (30-3)</LD>
<LD>   First-round opponent: Boston University.</LD>
<LD>   Season in brief: Climbed all the way to a top-five ranking after
starting the season unranked and 0-1 after a loss at Oklahoma State.
The Bearcats won 20 games in a row before a loss to Marquette that
they later avenged (twice), also defeating the Golden Eagles in the
Conference USA tournament title game. The only other loss was to
Louisville.</LD>
<TE>   Player to watch: Steve Logan. The 6-foot senior point guard had
five 30-point games during the regular season and has turned himself
into one of the nation's top players, slimming down and moving from
the point to shooting guard and back during his career.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Logan has scored in double figures for more than 50 games
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Cincinnati overcame a recent second-round jinx to reach
the Sweet 16 last season. Most recent Final Four was in 1992. Won
NCAA titles in 1961 and '62.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 OKLAHOMA (27-4)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Illinois Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Sooners were ranked No. 4 after the regular
season and knocked off No. 1 Kansas in the Big 12 tournament title
game. They notched an impressive 16-point victory over Maryland in
December, then finished second to Kansas in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Hollis Price. Guard overcame multiple surgeries
on his right arm after a collision with an Indiana State player in
first-round upset loss last year that left a tooth fragment in his
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Guard Ebi Ere is a native of Tulsa, Okla. His father is
Nigerian.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Reached Sweet 16 under Kelvin Sampson in 1999, but
Sooners were first-round losers in 1995, '96, '97, '98 and 2001.
Reached Final Four in 1988 under Billy Tubbs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 ARIZONA (22-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Disregarded after losing four starters from a
Final Four team, the Wildcats bolted into the Top 25 with
season-opening victories over Maryland and Florida. They finished the
regular season with an 8-6 record against ranked teams and defeated
USC in the Pacific 10 tournament final.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Luke Walton. Basketball purists can't resist the
game of the 6-8 junior who became the first forward to lead the
Pac-10 in assists.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: The tattoo on Walton's right shoulder--four Grateful Dead
skeleton-type figures spinning basketballs--represents him and his
three basketball-playing brothers.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Lost to Duke in NCAA title game last season. Four Final
Four appearances, including 1997 when Wildcats won the national
championship after finishing fifth in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 OHIO STATE (23-7)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Davidson.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: One of the four teams to share the Big Ten
regular-season title and won the conference tournament championship.
The Buckeyes got off to a 15-2 start--with big wins coming against
Louisville and Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Brian Brown. The 6-4 senior point guard was
first-team all-conference.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Senior shooting guard Boban Savovic's brother, Predrag
Savovic, is a standout player for Hawaii, which also made the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Nine Final Fours, most recently in 1999. Won title in
1960. Upset by Utah State in first round last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 MIAMI (24-7)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Started the season 14-0 against somewhat modest
competition--although the Hurricanes did defeat Indiana--before
losing consecutive games to Connecticut and St. John's. Went 10-6 in
Big East games during the regular season and lost to Pittsburgh in
the conference tournament semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Darius Rice. The 6-10 sophomore forward can
handle the ball and make the three-point shot as well as play inside.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Rice, from Jackson, Miss., is a nephew of NFL receiver
Jerry Rice.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Only fifth appearance overall, but the fourth in five
years. Coach Perry Clark took Tulane to the tournament three times in
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 GONZAGA (29-3)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Bulldogs dumped their old Cinderella tag by
earning a No. 6 national ranking, but the selection committee wasn't
swayed. Gonzaga lost only to nonconference foes Illinois and
Marquette before splitting with Pepperdine to tie for the West Coast
Conference regular-season title. Gonzaga settled things with the
Waves in the WCC tournament final with a 96-90 victory behind Dan
Dickau's 27-point second half.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Dickau. Point guard led the WCC in scoring (20.8)
while shooting almost 50% from three-point range. He and teammate
Blake Stepp routinely let it fly from 25 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Dickau wears No. 21 to honor John Stockton's unofficially
retired No. 12.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: One of three teams to reach the Sweet 16 each of last
three seasons. Duke and Michigan State are others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 XAVIER (25-5)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Musketeers reached the Top 25 late in the
season with a record that didn't include many marquee victories. They
lost two games after mid-December and won the Atlantic 10 tournament
after opening with an overtime victory over Massachusetts in which
they shot less than 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: David West. The 6-8 junior center who considered
turning pro after last season is one of 20 finalists for the Wooden
Award.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: First-year coach Thad Matta took Butler to the second
round last season, losing to Arizona after an upset of Wake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Fourteenth appearance overall. Lost to Mississippi in
first round last season. Five of six victories in 19 NCAA games came
under Pete Gillen, now at Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 UCLA (19-11)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Another season of wild swings was marked by
losses to Ball State, Pepperdine, Villanova and Arizona State--and
victories over No. 1 Kansas as well as Alabama, USC, Arizona and
Stanford. The Bruins were in the Pac-10 race until the final week,
but finished sixth and lost to Cal in the quarterfinals of the Pac-10
tournament. A big March question mark is whether either Cedric
Bozeman or Ryan Walcott can handle the job at point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Jason Kapono. Others such as Matt Barnes and Dan
Gadzuric take their turn, but the 6-8 junior forward needs to be
involved and on his game for the Bruins to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Gadzuric has never fouled out of an NCAA tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Under Steve Lavin, UCLA is 9-5 in tournament games with
one first-round loss, three Sweet 16s and one trip to the Elite
Eight. UCLA owns an NCAA record with 11 titles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 MISSISSIPPI (20-10)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Rebels beat SEC champion Alabama and
Florida--both ranked in the top 10--at home in the final weeks of the
season, but have lost six of nine entering the tournament. They also
held their own in the conference after early-season losses to Bowling
Green and George Mason.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Justin Reed. The 6-8 sophomore forward led Ole
Miss in scoring (14.6) and rebounding (7.6).</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Reed's free-throw shooting improvement--from 54.9% last
season to 78.1% this season--was the biggest turnaround by any player
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Made Sweet 16 last season before losing to Arizona.
Fifth appearance in six years, with Rod Barnes taking over where Rob
Evans left off after he went to Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 HAWAII (27-5)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Xavier.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: This Rainbow Coalition of a team includes players
from Yugoslavia, Canada, Guam, Israel, Lithuania, South Africa,
France and Nigeria--as well as one Hawaiian. Notable results this
season include victories over Wisconsin and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Predrag Savovic. The 6-6 senior guard averages
close to 19 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Savovic is the older brother of Ohio State player Boban
Savovic, also competing in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Fourth appearance and second in a row for Hawaii, which
has never won an NCAA tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 WYOMING (21-8)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Cowboys were upset by San Diego State in the
Mountain West Conference tournament semifinals, but made the field as
an at-large team after winning the regular-season title. (A sweep of
Utah was the key.) Opened the season with a 13-point loss to USC in
the Preseason NIT.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Marcus Bailey. The 6-5 junior forward is the
leading scorer in a balanced attack that includes standout senior
forward Josh Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Broadcaster Curt Gowdy played for Wyoming from 1940-42,
graduating the year before the Cowboys won the NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Upset UCLA in second round of 1987 tournament with a
team led by Fennis Dembo and Eric Leckner, but the Cowboys haven't
been back since 1988. Won NCAA title in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 MISSOURI (21-11)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: A significant disappointment this season, the
Tigers were ranked as high as No. 2 before sliding to a sixth-place
finish in the Big 12 at 9-7. Best victory was over Alabama, and among
the losses was a three-point decision against Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Kareem Rush. The 6-6 junior forward, brother of
former UCLA player JaRon Rush, was the Tigers' leading scorer at 19.7
points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Coach Quin Snyder is a former Clipper assistant.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: The Tigers have never made a Final Four. They lost to
Duke in the second round last season in their second appearance under
Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 DAVIDSON (21-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: Not that it's an exclusive club, but this is one
of the teams that beat North Carolina. The Wildcats, however, lost to
Duke, 106-71. They earned a trip to the tournament by defeating
Furman in the Southern Conference final.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Emeka Erege. The 6-5 forward leads the team in
scoring at 13.6 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Davidson, located near Charlotte, N.C., has players from
Ireland, Finland, Nigeria, England, Africa, the Czech Republic and
Rome--Rome, Georgia, that is.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Six appearances, most recently in 1998. The last
victories were under Lefty Driesell, who took Wildcats to regional
finals in 1968 and '69.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 UC SANTA BARBARA (20-10)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: It feels like a return to the heyday of former
coach Jerry Pimm. The Gauchos are back in the tournament for the
first time since 1990 after upsetting Utah State in the Big West
final, 60-56. They defeated UC Irvine in the semifinals, knocking off
the top two seeded teams. A victory over Pepperdine early in season
was long considered a knock on the Waves' resume that no longer looks
so bad.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Mark Hull. The 6-7 junior forward from Glendale
Hoover High is the team's leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: Coach Bob Williams guided UC Davis to the NCAA Division II
championship in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Santa Barbara made the field in 1988 and '90 with such
players as Brian Shaw and Eric McArthur. One victory--a mild
first-round upset of Houston in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 ILLINOIS CHICAGO (20-13)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: It was brother against brother in the Horizon
League final, but Martell Bailey's Illinois Chicago team outlasted
David Bailey's Loyola Chicago team in overtime to claim the automatic
bid. The Flames were only 8-8 in conference, finishing sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Cedrick Banks. The 6-3 sophomore guard was a
much-acclaimed Chicago prep player who stayed at home. He made the
game-winning shot with four seconds left in the conference final.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: The Flames won the tournament title after favorite Butler
was upset by Wisconsin Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA bio: Second appearance. Lost to Charlotte in a first-round
No. 8 vs. No. 9 game in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 BOSTON UNIVERSITY (22-9)</TE>
<TE>   First-round opponent: Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Season in brief: The Terriers won the America East Conference's
automatic bid by blowing out Maine in a game played on BU's home
court. They needed Stijn Dhondt's three-pointer with 0.1 of a second
left against Hartford to reach the title game. Notable results

<HD>It's Down to Waves, Gauchos</HD>
<DH>Women's preview: Two local schools are only teams from
Southern California in a tournament where Pac-10 has only two
representatives.</DH>

<LD>As soon as Pepperdine Coach Mark Trakh saw his team was given the
eighth seeding in the West Regional of the NCAA women's tournament,
there was reason to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   "Getting an eighth seed is pretty high for us," Trakh said.</LD>
<LD>   Not that the 23-7 Waves, who won the West Coast Conference
regular-season and tournament championships, got any breaks from the
NCAA selection committee, which made Connecticut, Oklahoma, Duke and
Vanderbilt its four No. 1-seeded teams.</LD>
<TE>   The Waves were sent to Norman, Okla., where they will face
Villanova, a 19-10 Big East team, in the first round Saturday. If
Pepperdine wins, it will most likely face the Sooners, who are coming
off an impressive Big 12 tournament title victory, in the second
round on Oklahoma's home floor.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to go there and just bring home a T-shirt," said
Trakh, whose team is 5-0 on neutral courts this season. "We want to
win a game. It's important for us to win a game for our conference."</TE>
<TE>   This is Pepperdine's second NCAA appearance in women's basketball.
The school's first tournament game came in 2000, and Virginia quickly
showed the Waves the exit sign with a 74-62 first-round beating.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Sarah Richen, who was on Pepperdine's NCAA team two years
ago, said the Waves will be taking a different attitude into the
postseason this time.</TE>
<TE>   "This trip is a lot different from the last one because there was
no finger-crossing involved," Richen said. "We knew we were in the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going in on a mission this time instead of just being happy
to be there."</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara and Coach Mark French have a similar sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos (25-5), who face fifth-seeded Louisiana Tech Friday in
the East Regional at Austin, Texas, have a longer tournament history
with seven appearances since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Barbara, which won a sixth consecutive Big West
tournament championship, has gone beyond the first round only twice.
The past three years the Gauchos lasted only one game.</TE>
<TE>   The point was brought home to French when Santa Barbara was seeded
12th despite a 21-game winning streak and a rigorous schedule that
included tournament teams Stanford, Penn State, Virginia and Nevada
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little surprised," French said. "I thought our
[nonconference] schedule would carry more weight. But it also shows
me if we had won, say, even three first-round games in the six years
we might have received better treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, it's a great honor to play a legendary program like
Louisiana Tech and a legendary coach, Leon Barmore. For those of us
who are historians, Louisiana Tech is one of the top three or four
programs. It's a big opportunity for us."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Kayte Christensen shares French's belief that Santa Barbara
has had its chances to advance in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach has this random stat about [how] a couple of possessions
would have won three or four games in the tournament," Christensen
said. "We've tried to keep that in mind when we practice, that one
basket can make the difference."</TE>
<TE>   While moving past the first round is a formidable challenge for
the Southland teams, nothing but an NCAA title will suffice for
top-ranked Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies have barely broken a sweat in going 33-0. Connecticut
faced eight ranked teams and only Virginia Tech managed to lose by
fewer than 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was a first important step for the 64 teams trying to get
to San Antonio for the Final Four, and already there are winners and
losers.</TE>
<TE>   The winners: The SEC and Big 12 conferences, which got eight and
seven teams, respectively, into the tournament. All seven Big 12
teams will play host to first- and second-round games.</TE>
<TE>   The big loser: The Pacific 10 Conference, which has only two teams
in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest bracket: The Midwest, which has Vanderbilt,
Tennessee, Iowa State, Florida, Minnesota and Arizona State. All are
or were ranked during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Best gift recipient: Penn State, with a fourth seeding in the
Mideast. Although the Lady Lions reached the Big Ten tournament
final, it is rare that a team with 11 losses is placed this high.</TE>
<TE>   As for potential upsets, South Carolina, Notre Dame, Boston
College, Colorado State and Minnesota could have trouble with
first-round opponents Liberty, New Mexico, Mississippi State, Tulane
and UNLV.</TE>
