<HD>Listen to Our Band and Visit L.A. Too!</HD>
<DH>Radio: After a three-year gap, the L.A. Philharmonic
returns to the airwaves, backed by the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.</DH>

<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Philharmonic, known for sometimes pushing the
boundaries in its music choices, is bucking another trend among its
orchestral brethren--while others are retreating from the airwaves,
Esa-Pekka Salonen and company are reaching out to audiences beyond
the concert hall.</LD>
<LD>   And along with the Schoenberg comes a little salesmanship in the
form of a new series of radio broadcasts that also feature interview
segments touting Los Angeles as a cultural destination.</LD>
<LD>   Starting this week, and continuing for the next 12, the
Philharmonic is airing concerts on KUSC-FM (91.5) and more than 130
stations nationwide. The concerts were drawn from the 2000-2001
season, but during intermissions, the Los Angeles Convention &amp;
Visitors Bureau--the program's sponsor--will drop in a short feature
highlighting some aspect of L.A. culture. "It communicates to people
in the rest of the country that Los Angeles is a major cultural
center," said Brenda Barnes, president and general manager of KUSC
radio.</LD>
<TE>   The radio series, which can be heard locally at noon Sundays,
marks the Philharmonic's return to the airwaves after a three-year
absence at a time when orchestras and opera companies are
disappearing from their local radio stations, much less those across
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "That was once the rule. Now it's the exception. What Los Angeles
is doing here is really significant," said Jack McAuliffe, vice
president of the American Symphony Orchestra League, the professional
association that represents 1,800 groups nationwide ranging from the
largest metropolitan philharmonics down to the tiniest youth
orchestras. "There are a small group of orchestras where their
community is worldwide and the Philharmonic is among them."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1999-2000 survey of its members, the most recent poll
available, the Orchestra League found that of the 25 largest
orchestras in the country, half broadcast at least some of their
concerts.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, when Amoco withdrew its sponsorship of the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra's broadcasts before this season, the CSO couldn't
find another sponsor and had to suspend both its nationally
syndicated and local programs. Among the rest of the nation's six
largest orchestras, only San Francisco and New York join Los Angeles
with regular, nationally syndicated programs. Boston and Philadelphia
have local or regional radio concert series.</TE>
<TE>   "Where other people are retracting, we're in an expansion mode,"
said Deborah Borda, managing director of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic. "We're looking to the future."</TE>
<TE>   The series arose out of a partnership between the Philharmonic,
KUSC and the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. The bureau had previously
sponsored a series of broadcasts by the Philharmonic on the area's
commercial classical station, KMZT-FM (105.1), but a funding crunch
ended that, Borda said.</TE>
<TE>   "These things cost money to produce and to pay the musicians, and
there wasn't any money," said Borda, who came to Los Angeles from the
New York Philharmonic two years ago. "It was important to me to get
the orchestra back on the air. Any great orchestra has national
broadcasts."</TE>
<TE>   Distributed through a network created by Chicago classical station
WFMT, the Philharmonic series will air on stations from Hawaii to New
York--triple the number from when the orchestra was previously on the
radio, Borda said.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming broadcasts will include not only favorites such as
Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" and "Firebird" Suite and Beethoven's
Piano Concerto No. 1, but also works such as Scriabin's "Poem of
Ecstasy," several pieces by Rodrigo and Leonard Bernstein's symphonic
suite from "On the Waterfront."</TE>
<TE>   The short vignettes, which will fill the eight- to 15-minute
intermissions, will comprise interviews and discussions examining
other L.A. cultural offerings. John Rubinstein, an actor, musician
and son of pianist Arthur Rubinstein, is hosting the program and
doing the intermission interviews, which will include such features
as a look at Los Angeles as the new mecca for art students much like
Paris and New York were in previous centuries; examine the mural as
one of the city's signature art forms; look at what is new and hot in
the restaurant scene; and include official state historian Kevin
Starr talking about Los Angeles' place as an emerging world center of
culture and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "Even educated and sophisticated people don't have a sense of how
rich Los Angeles is in terms of culture. Everybody in the rest of the
world thinks we're lying on the beach talking on our cell phones,"
said Robert Barrett, vice president of domestic marketing for the
Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, whose $100,000 sponsorship is paying
for the program's labor, recording and distribution costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The L.A. Philharmonic is one of our most significant
ambassadors," he said, especially when it gets rave reviews on its
national and international tours. "If I were to take $100,000 and try
to buy advertising to drive L.A. as a destination, how far would I
get? It doesn't take a genius to realize how many people are going to
hear about L.A. through this program."</TE>
<TE>   Borda hopes the broadcasts will change how people view Los Angeles
as a destination. "It's a great mixture. It's a real look at the
contemporary scene here today, how multicultural this city is," she
said. Barnes believes the broadcasts will not only raise the profile
of the orchestra nationally, but will benefit local fans of the
Philharmonic who live within the reach of KUSC but can't make it to
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. In addition, she said that KUSC and
the other partners are committed to future series that will showcase
the Philharmonic's performances at least through the opening of the
2003 season and the debut of the landmark Walt Disney Concert Hall.</TE>
<TE>   But such a commitment is becoming harder to find. With the notable
exception of New York's Metropolitan Opera, which recently opened its
62nd season on the airwaves, classical orchestras and opera companies
are finding fewer sponsors to help them air programs, either locally
or nationally, and fewer stations interested in playing their music.</TE>
<TE>   "There are, sadly, relatively few stations in the country that
make a commitment to classical music," Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   Within the past five or so years, public radio stations around the
country began moving away from music and more toward news and talk
programming. Radio station consolidation, which brought with it a
leap in station prices, have made commercial classical stations an
endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to buy a station in Los Angeles for $175 million,
you can't afford to run it as a classical station," said Barnes,
noting that the audience isn't broad enough to attract the
advertising needed to pay the rent.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, fewer big sponsors are funding classical programming
series, weighing that prestige and corporate citizenship against the
bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "They began to wonder, is this the biggest bang for their buck?"
said Judith Kurnick, director of public relations for the
Philadelphia Orchestra, which itself began a concert series this
season on local public radio station WHYY.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, WHYY-FM eliminated its limited menu of classical
music and went all news and talk. But in November 2000 its radio and
public television outlets aired the Philadelphia Orchestra's 100th
anniversary concert, and a tribute concert in September after the
terrorist attacks. "We got great feedback from that," said Arthur
Ellis, WHYY communications director, which led to the current series
of 26 concerts that WHYY now broadcasts on Sunday nights. The move
has paid off with the station's Sunday night audience doubling.
McAuliffe said the situation in Los Angeles, with the Visitors Bureau
sponsoring the Philharmonic's program, may ensure its longevity, as
the two have parallel interests.</TE>
<TE>   "The inclusion of the city as a partner is, I think, a rather
sophisticated and inventive approach," he said. "It's giving this
more visibility and viability."</TE>

<HD>Resurrected by a Song</HD>
<DH>The real Ivor Novello, actor, composer and Noel Coward's
friendly rival, wrote the tunes his namesake sings in 'Gosford Park.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES DENNIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No, those aren't obscure Noel Coward songs Jeremy Northam sings in
Robert Altman's new film, "Gosford Park." In the film, a comic sendup
of '30s-era British murder mysteries, Northam plays Ivor Novello,
who--unlike any of the other two dozen or so characters in the
ensemble piece--was a real person, the one who actually wrote those
tunes.</LD>
<LD>   The similarity to Coward's music (or vice versa) was far from
coincidental, and the two men enjoyed a close friendship and
professional rivalry for 35 years. Who was this largely forgotten
actor-composer, and how did he come to materialize 50 years after his
death in this witty film that has already won many pre-Oscar awards
for its director, screenwriter and actors?</LD>
<LD>   Novello was Britain's first pop star of the 20th century. A child
of humble origins, the drop-dead-handsome Welshman adopted the stage
and screen persona of a devil-may-care nobleman. His first success
came as a composer of popular songs in the late teens and early '20s.
His legend was enhanced as Britain's biggest silent screen star and
later as the author of some dreadful stage potboilers, which played
in London's West End for years solely because of his star power, and,
finally, as the writer of a series of romantic musicals.</LD>
<TE>   His fame was such that five years after his death in 1951, the
Ivor Novello Awards, known as the Ivors, were created by the British
Academy of Composers &amp; Songwriters to honor outstanding contributions
to British music. Paul MCartney, John Lennon, Elton John and Andrew
Lloyd Webber are some of the many recipients</TE>
<TE>   Novello's presence in "Gosford Park" is far from haphazard.
Screenwriter Julian Fellowes used this commoner posing as a nobleman
to underscore the serious theme of this deceptively entertaining
thriller.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd already written the screenplay in 2000 when Bob Altman said
he wanted to use Ivor Novello's music throughout and have Ivor as an
actual character," Fellowes said in a recent phone call from New
York, where he'd gone to receive the New York Film Critics award
along with director Robert Altman and co-star Helen Mirren. (The
three are also nominated, along with actress Maggie Smith, for Golden
Globes.) Novello is very much a chorus figure, both with his
beautiful melodies and as a symbol of England's class wars.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not born into the upper classes, you're never one of
that crowd," says Fellowes. "Ivor accepts the fact that he's the
'Jester.' When [a character in the film] asks how he can put up with
these weekends where he's basically the unpaid entertainment, playing
piano on request, he replies poignantly: 'I make my living
impersonating them.'"</TE>
<TE>   He was born David Ivor Novello Davies in 1893. His mother was a
music teacher who left her 6-month-old child behind in Cardiff,
Wales, to shepherd her girls choir to the Chicago World's Fair, where
the girls "cleared the board of every prize possible" (according to
her son) and were subsequently invited to entertain Queen Victoria.
"It was almost a national sensation," Novello wrote years later.</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder that Novello went on to sing and play the piano by
age 3 and to win a scholarship to Oxford at 10. At 16, he went to
London, where his first song was published the next year. Four years
later he became world-famous and wealthy with a World War I tune, the
super-patriotic "Keep the Home Fires Burning."</TE>
<TE>   Novello's continued success as a songwriter and his good looks--he
was referred to in the press as "the handsomest man in
England"--brought him to the attention of movie director Louis
Mercanton, who, in 1919, cast him as the lead in "Call of the Blood."
With no professional acting experience, Novello became the biggest
film star in England until the advent of talkies, while continuing
his very successful career as a songwriter. Two years after his first
screen appearance, he made his stage debut in the West End, where he
remained a force until his death 30 years later.</TE>
<TE>   In 1917, Novello met a struggling 17-year-old actor named Noel
Coward outside the Midlands Hotel in Manchester. Coward was in awe of
Novello's talent, celebrity and great beauty but later wrote of this
first encounter: "Ivor was wearing an old overcoat with an Astrakhan
collar and a degraded brown hat, and if he had suddenly produced a
violin and played the 'Barcarolle' from the 'Tales of Hoffman,' I
should have given him threepence from sheer pity."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later Coward joined Novello's celebrity circle with
the overnight success of his play "The Vortex," in which he also
starred. The two men worked together only once, 10 years later in
Coward's play "Sirocco," the biggest failure in either man's career.
(Coward was spit on by an incensed audience when he left the
theater).</TE>
<TE>   Novello's silent films were mostly romantic costume dramas--think
of him as the Rudolph Valentino of Britain--with few exceptions,
including Alfred Hitchcock's first big hit, "The Lodger," in which
Novello played a purported Jack the Ripper. The distributors knew
Novello's legion of fans wouldn't stand for "their Ivor" being a
serial murderer, so the script was rewritten so that Novello was
ultimately revealed not to be the Ripper. Hitchcock's subsequent film
"Downhill" also starred Novello and was adapted from "an awful play"
(Hitchcock's description) by Novello.</TE>
<TE>   Novello began writing plays for himself in the 1920s. Coward, in
awe of Novello's ability to endlessly write beautiful tunes (which
clearly influenced much of Coward's own music), did not share this
enthusiasm for the Welshman's playwriting skills or acting ability.
He would cringe in his seat throughout these performances, steeling
himself to go backstage afterward and tell Novello precisely what he
thought.</TE>
<TE>   But Novello always thwarted these critical assessments by flinging
his dressing room door open and disarming the younger man in his
distinctive Welsh tones: "Aaaah, ducky. I knew you'd like it." Coward
eventually gave up trying to improve on Novello's success and
admitted: "Nobody who ever knew Ivor for five minutes could ever
begrudge him anything."</TE>
<TE>   Chain-smoking his Abdullah Turkish cigarettes, driven around the
West End by Morgan, his chauffeur, in a maroon Rolls-Royce with
"I.N." in gold leaf on each door, dining at the Ivy (the Sardi's of
London) with Gladys Cooper and other great beauties of the time
(although he and actor Robert Andrews were a couple for 35 years), he
held court and served tea in his legendary apartment in the Aldwych
"occasionally enhanced but never interrupted," Coward wrote, "by
peculiar noises from the next room where Mme. Novello Davies gave
interminable singing lessons to small Welsh women in grey clothes."</TE>
<TE>   But by November 1932, the period in which "Gosford Park" is set,
circumstances had taken a decidedly unpleasant turn for Novello.
Hoping to recapture the success of the silent "The Lodger," he remade
it with sound but without Hitchcock. It was a flop. His
talking-picture persona was deemed wooden and, by 1932, his career in
movies was effectively over. His last film was in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an element of pathos in Jeremy's performance that makes
Novello very moving," says "Gosford Park" screenwriter Fellowes of
Northam. "He's at the end of one career not knowing what his next one
will be. He's very interesting, not an obvious braggadocio but a
depressed show-biz character."</TE>
<TE>   "The film shows the upper classes losing connection with popular
culture," says Fellowes. "Constance [Maggie Smith] has never seen
Ivor's movies and tries to dissuade the others from listening to his
music. On the other hand, the servants hide in corners and listen
devotedly. This shows the working classes looking forward to the
future and the upper classes looking forward to the past."</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Ivor Novello? He reinvented himself yet again and
had his greatest successes on stage beginning in 1935 with "Glamorous
Night," an opera-operetta-musical comedy. Although he also starred in
this smash hit, he did not sing (unlike Coward) and wrote only the
music (unlike Coward, who wrote tunes and lyrics). But he was a
superstar. "Glamorous Night" and subsequent Novello shows "Careless
Rapture," "Crest of the Wave," "The Dancing Years," "Perchance to
Dream" and "King's Rhapsody" ran for years. They were schmaltzy
romances capitalizing on Novello's romantic silent-screen image, and
the public ate them up.</TE>
<TE>   He would undoubtedly have been knighted for his contributions to
stage and film if he hadn't been arrested during World War II for
purchasing black-market petrol; he served a brief prison term.</TE>
<TE>   He died of a heart attack in March 1951 after a performance of his
hit "King's Rhapsody" (in the second year of its West End run). When
the play was filmed four years later, Errol Flynn played the
glamorous monarch.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Novello died, Coward wrote in his diary: "I shall miss
him very much because, in spite of his plays and his acting, I was
very fond of him--also he is another landmark swept away."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't a planned ensemble or a scored composition, but there was
something wonderfully spontaneous and, in its own way, creative about
what happened at 6 on Thursday night at the Long Beach Convention
Center. It took place at the opening of the exhibit room of the
International Assn. for Jazz Education's 29th annual conference, in a
large area devoted solely to manufacturers of music instruments and
their accessories.</LD>
<LD>   As the doors swung open, an eager crowd of musicians--students,
teachers, professionals--rushed in to ogle, touch and try out the
array of shiny trumpets and trombones, saxophones of every size and
magnificent-looking drum sets.</LD>
<LD>   The result, as more and more instruments were put through their
paces, was a kind of instant cacophony--at least from one point of
view. But it was the sort of cacophony that John Cage would have
loved. And beyond its randomness, it was a kind of found aural art,
filled with turbulent timbres and layers of rhythms surrounding
sudden bursts of melody and accent, as one player or another surfaced
through the mix.</LD>
<TE>   For those with the patience to step back and simply allow the
sounds to wash through one's consciousness, the experience was
fascinating, an opportunity to hear music in a very different manner
from the mind-set required by the more traditional ensembles. And it
may be that one of the reasons the exhibit room opening was such fun
was the fact that most of the scheduled performances were
well-crafted but relatively straight-ahead musical efforts.</TE>
<TE>   That said, there was a lot to choose from. Among the scheduled
artists: alto saxophonist Richie Cole, singer Tierney Sutton, pianist
JoAnne Brackeen, trumpeter Tiger Okoshi, the Billy Childs Sextet and
the Bob Florence Big Band. In addition, the opening general session
of the conference showcased compositions commissioned by
ASCAP/IAJE/Billy Taylor ("Catch Me If You Can" by Jason Goldman and
"Billyssimo" by Jovino Santos Neto) as well as John Hollenbeck's "A
Blessing, the 2002 Gil Evans Commission."</TE>
<TE>   On the cutting-edge professional level, there was an appearance by
saxophonist Don Braden's hard-driving Contemporary Standards
Ensemble, a three-horn band whose arrangements produced the sound of
a considerably larger group. And the Jason Moran Trio, featuring Greg
Osby, was especially illuminating as a showcase for pianist Moran.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the day's high points, however, came from less familiar
sources. Gold Company, for example, is a vocal ensemble from Western
Michigan University that performed not just at a solidly professional
level, but with considerable creativity as well. One of its most
fascinating pieces was an imaginative a cappella arrangement of "Tea
for Two" in which various sorts of vocal sounds were used to generate
percussive effects.</TE>
<TE>   Katia Moraes and Sambaguru are fairly well known to Los Angeles
fans of music that hovers creatively between jazz and Brazilian
rhythms. But the group's performance, as always, was filled with
body-moving rhythms, driving percussion and sensual vocalizing beyond
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Wrapping up a busy day, there was "Pro Jam I," the first of
several scheduled impromptus displaying specific musical areas--in
this case, the seminal jazz of Central Avenue. And the crisp,
hard-swinging playing of Europe's WDR Big Band affirmed the global
reach of jazz and of the IAJE conference.</TE>

<BD>TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"CMT Crossroads," a monthly series that debuts at 8 p.m. Sunday on
the Country Music Television cable channel, is such an exciting idea
that the program's creators apparently felt the concept alone is
enough. It isn't.</LD>
<LD>   In a pop music world where radio and TV programmers draw narrow
boundaries, it's welcome news indeed when a series defies arbitrary
categorization by bringing together leading figures from separate
fields--in this case pairing a country artist with someone from rock,
R&amp;B or pop.</LD>
<LD>   In the opening show, rock's Elvis Costello and country's Lucinda
Williams--passionate and original artists who have drawn freely from
both fields--are splendid choices.</LD>
<TE>   The pairing works marvelously at times, especially on Williams'
"Change the Locks" and Costello's "Indoor Fireworks," songs about the
tensions and thorns of relationships that embody the sense of
dramatic obsession running through both artists' work.</TE>
<TE>   It's equally winning to see them turn to the Rolling Stones' "Wild
Horses" to point out the long connection between country and rock.</TE>
<TE>   But there aren't as many highlights as there should be in the
hourlong show. It's nice to have a ragged, dress-rehearsal feel to
the program, which is taped with an audience, but more structure
would help. Eliminating the idle chatter (including an extended
question-and-answer session) would provide more time for music, and
the musical segments could be more revealing if they went beyond the
artists' own material to showcase songs from their respective fields
that they both admire. With fine-tuning, "CMT Crossroads" could be
much more than just a good concept.</TE>

<HD>'Today' Stays With the Times: On Top</HD>
<DH>A lot has changed in 50 years, but the venerable morning
show has made a virtue of adaptability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When Barbara Walters started co-anchoring "Today" in the mid-1960s,
she made union scale: "$750 per week, and I was thrilled." As the NBC
show, the original morning program, turns 50 years old on Monday,
it's a different world, one in which current co-anchor Katie Couric's
recent deal will pay her an estimated $16 million per year in what's
thought to be the largest deal ever for a news personality.</LD>
<LD>   But from the perspective of Walters, now on ABC and one of the
many news stars to emerge from "Today" over the years, what's most
fascinating is not what has changed but what hasn't. Essentially, she
says, "it's been the same basic format for 50 years." As former
executive producer Steve Friedman puts it, "The bells and whistles
are different, but it's still the same train."</LD>
<LD>   There's no longer a chimpanzee on the set (two chimps, J. Fred
Muggs and Kokomo Jr., were frequently featured in 1953), and Couric
hasn't been forbidden by NBC's president--as Walters was--from asking
a question until her male co-anchor has asked three. (Walters
co-anchored the show from 1964 to 1976, but got the title only when
anchor Frank McGee died in 1974.) The weather girl is now a
weatherman, Al Roker.</LD>
<TE>   But the "Today" essentials remain the same: a mix of news and
entertainment that fluctuates with events. It almost always starts
with the story of the day and is designed to let viewers dip in and
out, depending on whether they want to know about the collapse of
energy trader Enron, Jack Black's new movie "Orange County," news
anchor Ann Curry's upcoming exclusive interview with former
government scientist Wen Ho Lee or Monday's nostalgic look at the
show's own history, complete with visits from many former "Today"
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Anchors and reporters often travel overseas or to such events as
preparations for the upcoming Salt Lake City Olympics to boost
ratings. Even "Today's" ground-floor studio has its roots in the
past. Until the 1960s, the show broadcast at times from a Florida
tourist office on the ground floor of New York City's Rockefeller
Center, where fans could look in the window and the resident parrot
had cloth over his cage to keep him from annoying guests.</TE>
<TE>   It's a flexible, often-copied mix that has allowed the show to
adapt over the years to periods of more and less news. And although
it hasn't much changed, the television environment around it has. As
a result, "Today," which began life to sharp questions about whether
viewers would even tune in during the morning, is more relevant than
ever. As Couric's pay package illustrates, the show has in some ways
surpassed the flagship nightly news in importance to the network.</TE>
<TE>   As viewers have started getting up earlier in recent years, the
show's value has increased, primarily because morning news was the
one element on a network schedule for which audience growth was
possible, according to Joe Angotti, a former NBC News executive who
teaches at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.
Local stations added even earlier morning shows, which helped pump
the network ratings and revenues: "Today" contributes more than $400
million in annual revenue to NBC. At the same time, the evening news
audience for the three major networks, while still roughly double the
morning audience, began shrinking, he says, as cable news drew
viewers away and entertainment channels gave viewers more
alternatives, such as movies and sports.</TE>
<TE>   But although network television doesn't have much of an advantage
in the evening, because it must compete with all the other options,
including the Internet, in the morning, "everybody has to wake up,"
says Friedman, who was executive producer of "Today" and now oversees
the rival CBS "Early Show."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he says, the audience keeps growing. "Everybody
thought that last year's fourth quarter was the highest the
three-network morning show audience would ever be," because of
interest in the disputed presidential election. But this year's
collective fourth-quarter audience, he notes, is 200,000 viewers
higher than it was a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, however, even as morning television has thrived, "Today"
has faltered. Although it remains comfortably in first place, its
fourth-quarter viewing is off 9% compared to a year ago; second-place
"Good Morning America" is up 6%, CBS' "Early Show" has jumped 14%,
and CNN and Fox News Channel have also gained.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation has centered on the show's decision to approach the
news somewhat differently from rivals, as post-Sept. 11 interest in
news remains high, and on the routine growing pains as the staff
settles in with a new executive producer after years as a finely
tuned machine. It's not the first time the show has had problems.</TE>
<TE>   For its first 23 years, "Today" essentially had no competition, as
CBS divvied up the time period with news and the kids' show "Captain
Kangaroo"; ABC, which, as the third network, had other problems to
solve first, didn't program the time period.  Eventually, however,
ABC's "Good Morning America," which launched in 1975, began to make
inroads with a program heavier on entertainment and how-to service
pieces and surpassed "Today" in the early '80s. ("Today" hired a
consultant who suggested opening every show with news video, recalls
Angotti, a practice that continues today.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, a bungled transition from Jane Pauley to Deborah Norville
tarnished the show's luster for a time. (By contrast, CBS, which only
went head to head in 1984, veered over the years from serious news to
pure fluff, doing nothing very successfully, and only recently has
gained with former "Today" anchor Bryant Gumbel and co-anchor Jane
Clayson.)</TE>
<TE>   But though ratings have fluctuated over the years, "Today" usually
ends up on top, as it has been since 1995. "It's the original brand,
like Kleenex or Jell-O," says Friedman. "Always, no matter what the
crisis ... the 'Today' show bounces back."</TE>
<TE>   Medill's Angotti attributes the "Today" longevity to the fact that
the show "didn't lose its focus on information." And he says
executives have been good over the years at hiring the right
personalities, from original anchor Dave Garroway through Hugh Downs
(later Walters' co-anchor on ABC's "20/20"), current "Nightly News"
anchor Tom Brokaw and Couric's co-anchor, Matt Lauer. Most, he said,
maintained the tricky balance of being inviting and not too edgy
while "not backing away from good interviews. It's not an easy thing
to do, to conduct a really tough interview and then come back and be
light and happy and friendly."</TE>
<TE>   It is, as Walters says she recently told Couric over lunch, "still
the best job on the air. You're in touch with everything and you meet
everybody. You do everything from interview the secretary of state to
make pancakes and talk to Tom Cruise. If you can stand the hours,
it's the best job there is."</TE>

<HD>Ticket Master to the Stars Retires</HD>
<DH>Movies: For more than 20 years, Otto Spoerri decided who
sits where at the Academy Awards. As he hands off the job, he reviews
a few of the do's and don'ts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Otto Spoerri retired as controller of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences on New Year's Eve after a 24-year tenure. Spoerri
was best known in Hollywood as the man who annually decided who sat
where at the Academy Awards, a position of such clout that the Wall
Street Journal once described Spoerri, 68, as "the ultimate arbiter
of industry power."</LD>
<LD>   Over the decades, he decided whether Jack or Russell or Julia
would get front row or aisle seats at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
and the Shrine Auditorium. And he made certain that nominees from the
same category were never seated together.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Zurich, Switzerland, Spoerri received his bachelor's
degree from the Zurich Business College and moved to the U.S. in
1957. He worked in finance for a number of years before joining the
academy.</LD>
<TE>   Spoerri is staying on as a consultant through the 74th Academy
Awards on March 24, the first Oscar ceremony in its new home at the
Kodak Theatre at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex. He then will
return to Zurich to live and, he hopes, work part time. "I don't want
to sit on my fanny for seven days a week," he says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Spoerri reminisced about his job.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Did you start handling the tickets for the Academy
Awards as soon as you became controller in 1978?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Two years before [1978], I was a staff accountant on a
part-time basis and I got my first introduction to this crazy
business at that time. When I became controller, I still had another
lady who had been doing [the tickets] for, like, 40 years before she
retired. She was my mentor. After the second year as controller, I
had to take it over myself because she retired.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has anybody gotten angry at his or her seat placement?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am sure people have gotten angry, although I haven't had
direct confrontation with anybody. They probably swore at the four
walls and cursed me up and down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How is the seat allotment broken down?</TE>
<TE>   A: Studios get an allotment of tickets based on their nominations.
Then we have the nominees coming, and then we have the honored
guests, who are a list of maybe 40 different people who are guests of
the academy, from the governor to the mayor and police chief, and you
have past presidents of the academy and certain obligations to some
of the major contributors to the academy.</TE>
<TE>   So once all of that is in place and you know the basic
requirements for the nominees, then you start to get the phone calls
from the studios saying this nominee would like to have two more
seats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you work closely with the Academy Awards show producer in
planning the seating?</TE>
<TE>   A: Mainly the director.... Some directors like to seat the
nominees by picture. For instance, all of the "Crouching Tiger"
people were more or less in the same area. All of "Erin Brockovich's"
nominees are in the same area. Another director might do it strictly
by category. But he never puts two leading actors next to each other.
A supporting actor or actress always separates them. So what that
does, it gives the director a picture in the camera where he has all
the various nominees and personalities spread out through the whole
width of the auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   I also think it's more diplomatic to separate the five best male
acting people [for example]. I am sure they are all on a friendly
basis, but I think it's smarter to separate them a little bit. You
don't want to see a sad face next to a happy face.</TE>
<TE>   We only do this with the four acting categories, best picture and
best director. The rest of the categories, I play my own little game
as to who might be the favorites, so I can sit them near the aisle.
It doesn't always work out, and sometimes somebody has to climb over
10 or 12 people.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was it easier to plan the seating arrangement for the Chandler
or the Shrine Auditorium?</TE>
<TE>   A: Obviously, the Music Center is much more comfortable, but
Shrine Auditorium is much wider, so you can bring everybody farther
down as far as access to the stage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are there last-minute changes for ticket requests?</TE>
<TE>   A: Oh sure. It happens every year. Maybe a performer or a
presenter in the last minute decides they don't want to sit in the
audience; they want to sit in the green room [the backstage reception
area]. Or, all of a sudden, even though they said they wanted to be
in the green room, they decided they want to sit in the audience,
which is the worst case because all of a sudden you have to
scramble.... What I learned early on was to keep eight or 10 pairs
[of tickets] in my back pocket for situations like that.... You can
bring [academy] members who sit further back [closer to the stage].
They will be thrilled to all of a sudden move into the fifth or sixth
row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you been working with the new controller, Andy Horn, on
all the ins and outs of the academy tickets?</TE>
<TE>   A: When I was controller, I had both the financial responsibility
of the academy and the seating for the show and the Governors Ball.
Now it is split. We have the controller, who strictly deals in the
financial area, and we [will] have a gentleman whose new title is
membership administrator. The whole ticketing deal falls under the
membership office. This year, it will be much more intensified
because next year I am not going to be here. Plus, it's a new venue.</TE>
<TE>   The place [the Kodak Theatre] is obviously much smaller than the
Shrine, so you will not be able to accommodate all the [academy]
members who want tickets. The only great thing about the Shrine is we
could accommodate every member who wanted to go. Now, it is going to
be a lottery. It will take three years for everybody to get a chance
to go.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You're retiring in Zurich. Do you think you'll come back to see
the Oscars?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. The boss promised me two tickets as long as I live. I'll
have to make sure my successor puts me in a decent seat.</TE>

<HD>Three Curators Named at San Diego Museum</HD>

<BD>Vivian LeTran</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego has appointed a new head
curator and hired two new assistant curators.</LD>
<LD>   Curator Toby Kamps, who has been with the museum since January
1998, will head the exhibitions programs. Stephanie Hanor, who is a
doctoral candidate in art history from the University of Texas,

<LD>Sadly, both Shane Salerno and Earl Ofari Hutchinson have bought into
the Ali myth ("The Opposing Corners in Today's 'Ali' Matchup," Jan.
7).</LD>
<LD>   Muhammad Ali dodged the draft not because he opposed U.S. policy
during the Vietnam War, but because the Black Muslims considered any
war conducted by the U.S. government to be a "white man's war." This
is not a principled stand to be admired, but a manifestation of black
racism that should be condemned.</LD>
<LD>   On top of that, Ali was the first in a long line of what has
become a tidal wave of "trash talkers." His silly poetry making fun
of his opponents was seen at the time as brashness and much admired.</LD>
<TE>   In retrospect, it was infantile, bad sportsmanship and the most
obvious aspect of a personality best described with one
word--"blowhard."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I unfortunately have to agree with Earl Ofari Hutchinson. Will
Smith's portrayal of Ali deserves high praise for a young actor's
coming of age as he further develops his craft. However, the film
itself failed to capture a generation's coming of age as it developed
through the accomplishments, great deeds and misdeeds of one of
history's most unusual individuals.</TE>
<TE>   What is missing is the awesome spirit Ali imbued in young black
people and others as a strong, creatively articulate and, yes,
beautiful man of color who survived the full onslaught of America's
worst.</TE>
<TE>   I hoped the film would capture Ali's magic for the younger
generation, as well as for us to relive. I thought Smith would be the
perfect actor to cross the generations. But the disjointed delivery
of historical fact did not support Smith's dead-on portrayal.</TE>

<LD>After reading Steve Carney's puff piece on Sean Hannity ("Sean
Hannity Rushes In," Jan. 4), it's clear the future of Los Angeles
talk radio is looking mighty grim. I am so tired of listening to
these blowhards, from the holier-than-thou Dennis Prager (KRLA), who
seems to have a direct line to God, to that
libertarian-in-conservative-clothing Larry Elder (KABC).</LD>
<LD>   These and other local talk show hosts have built a career on
bashing liberals. If you listen to them on a regular basis, you would
be surprised to learn that we liberals are responsible for most of
the ills of the world: the sagging economy, the moral decay of
society, the breakup of the nuclear family, etc.</LD>
<LD>   I challenge Hannity, Prager and Elder to dispense with the liberal
bashing for one program--just one--and devote it instead to the
contributions liberals have made to the advancement of Western
civilization. You know, little things like the New Deal, civil
rights, women's liberation, AIDS funding and education and the end of
America's involvement in Vietnam.</LD>

<LD>It is with definite sadness that I learned of Peter Hemmings' death
on Jan. 4. Opera lovers of the city owe him a large debt of gratitude
for his steady hand in creating, and growing, Los Angeles Opera to
its world-renowned stature. The city is richer and stronger due to
his work.</LD>
<LD>   He was also a kind, approachable man, with a warm greeting, whose
knowledge and passion for opera became readily apparent during a
conversation with him before an opera.</LD>

<TE>   This letter is on behalf of the other Hollywood, those boys and
girls who are not as polished, erudite or removed as the older
Hollywood generation. The trainers and bartenders, the aspiring and
the lost, for whom [producer] Julia Phillips [who died Jan. 1] had a
special affinity.</TE>
<TE>   I was Julia's assistant for three years and she was a friend to me
for many more, though I was 21 years her junior. This is what I saw:
Julia always treated everyone equally, from the valet parker to the
maitre d' to the manicurist to the addict. She used to tell me it was
because "he or she might be the one to create the next great script,
novel or painting." I always suspected it had more to do with her
heart, a rooting for the underdog and the understanding of the
potential of human beings for good or bad.</TE>

<LD>Re Brian Lowry's On TV column, "A Kind Word for TV Suits" (Jan. 9)
about ABC management changes:</LD>
<LD>   Though it may not be limited to commentators on the motion picture
and television industries, there is a tendency to lionize new
executives as "whip-smart" and "aggressive," while later, on their
departure, they are reported as someone's under-performing scapegoat.</LD>
<LD>   An executive's job in all businesses is demanding, stressful and
competitive, but particularly so in the subjective world of
commissioning creative but commercial entertainment, where it is also
visible and unforgiving. That Stu Bloomberg has excelled at it for 20
years is an achievement to be noted with honor and respect.</LD>

<LD>Daryl H. Miller wonders "how a show as wildly uneven as "Queer as
Folk" can be so compulsively watchable" ("Return of Showtime's Gay
Soap," Jan. 5). Some of the rest of us wonder: If it weren't for the
frontal nudity and the explicit sex scenes, would anyone put up with
this show for five minutes?</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps viewers enjoy "Queer as Folk" because, like other soap
operas (which also offer cardboard characters, contrived situations
and bad dialogue), it's so silly.</LD>

<HD>Hilburn Says Grammys Got It Right, But Did They?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not that I tend to agree with Robert Hilburn on much of what happens
in the pop music world, but I think he is missing the mark with his
commendations for the Grammy screening committee ("Bravo--This Time
They Got It Right," Jan. 5). Sure, the diversity in the album of the
year category is great to see, but that alone does not mean that all
is right in the Grammy world (nor that those albums selected are the
"best" of the year).</LD>
<LD>   I'll pick a specific category to use as an example of my
complaints: the dance recording. How is it that Lionel Richie is in
this category? Does the nominating committee not understand its own
categories? Considering that dance music is filled with a large and
varied electronic music community with a wealth of dance recordings,
how is it that Gloria Estefan would ever find her way into this
category? I expected Daft Punk and Depeche Mode and can even respect
Janet Jackson, but where are the club hits? Where is Basement Jaxx's
"Romeo" or Chemical Brothers' "It Began in Afrika"? How about
Madonna's "Don't Tell" or Groove Armada's "Superstylin'"?</LD>
<LD>   How can you have a real competition among artists if you have the
wrong artists in the category?</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading Robert Hilburn for years, I can honestly say I am
terminally bored by his incessant picks for the year's "best." He
uses the term "right" for a subjective popularity contest like the
Grammys. Doesn't he know by now it's all about who has the most power
to grease the most palms? There is no such thing as "right" when it
comes to art.</TE>

<DH>Ex-angry-young-man of '70s punk Graham Parker still
maintains his razor-sharp edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>British rocker Graham Parker chomps into each question tossed at him
with the ready bite of an underfed Rottweiler on guard duty. Rock
radio in the U.S. is "corrupt and arrogant." On the road again with
his first new album in five years, he says, "The brutality of
[touring] surprises me every time."</LD>
<LD>   And the thought of picking up a guitar to rekindle the songwriting
craft that's made him a critical darling time and again? "I
absolutely dread it," he says backstage Thursday at the Coach House
in San Juan Capistrano, referring to his continuing fear that he'll
be unable to find anything interesting to say.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone expecting Parker to have mellowed 25 years after emerging,
alongside Elvis Costello, as one of the original angry young men of
the mid-'70s British punk/new wave revolution probably wasn't
listening to him anyway. From his 1976 debut album, "Howlin' Wind,"
to his 1981 high-water-mark effort "Squeezing Out Sparks" through his
latest, "Deepcut to Nowhere," Parker has sustained an intensity and
passion few in rock can match.</LD>
<TE>   He coupled punk's energy with his deeply rooted love for American
blues, R&amp;B and soul music, yet despite the critical accolades, he
never found across-the-board success.</TE>
<TE>   Among his new songs is "Syphilis and Religion," which he describes
as "two things the world could do without" and is as vitriolic as
anything he's ever sung.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even the "angry young man" tag makes him mad--not because at
51 the "young" part is long outdated, but because it's simply too
dismissive of a multifaceted singer and highly literate songwriter
who's also written love songs as disarmingly heartfelt as the new
"Depend on Me."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps rarer than the level of youthful energy Parker still packs
into his music is how he's managed to channel that passion all along
into adult themes and concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the song, one of the last Stones songs that goes: 'One day
girl we got to meet ... '? You don't buy it coming from a guy [Mick
Jagger's] age. Even though he is meeting chicks all over the place,
you don't buy it," he says, straining to be heard over co-headliner
Frank Black, who's down below belting out another of his own
emotionally supercharged songs. "There's always room for another good
teenage mating song, but you can't get away with a whole album of
that stuff when you're pushing 60."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Parker sings on "Deepcut" about the travails of a
gruff-on-the-outside, sweet-on-the-inside father of a teenage
daughter in "Tough on Clothes," then equitably takes a jab at his own
less-than-Dior-like fashion sense in "Socks 'N' Sandals."</TE>
<TE>   "'Socks 'N' Sandals'--you can only write that if you're an old
geezer," Parker says with a smile. "[To write] 'Tough on Clothes' you
need a lot of perspective. You need a kid-or two"--precisely the
number Parker and his wife have with their teenage daughter, Natalie,
and grade-school-age son, Jimmy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still using a lot of the same styles of music and the same
archetypes I've always used. 'Tough on Clothes' is a soul song; it
just so happens Otis Redding would never have been able to write it
because he died when he was 26.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something I've taken--the legacy of soul music--and
applied smart, interesting, grown-up lyrics to it. And I'm doing it
with rock 'n' roll as well....It's great fun to do that. I hope it
doesn't wear off or run out."</TE>
<TE>   At the outset of Thursday's show with the Boston-based Figgs trio,
they hit some ragged patches, but soon locked into a tightly focused
unit that punched out songs spanning his career.</TE>
<TE>   They opened with "Fool's Gold," a career-defining number from 1976
about never relenting in the search for life's real treasures, then
hopscotched across the years.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't, however, play "Dark Days," the leadoff track from
"Deepcut" that's easy to mistake as  a response to Sept. 11, even
though the album came out  in August.</TE>
<TE>   "Dark Days" talks of heightening tensions between India and
Pakistan, and he sings: "There has been a seismic shift/I felt the
whole earth quiver."</TE>
<TE>   "It's about a lot of things," he says. "It's about a general
feeling of apocalypse I'm sure most of us get in this day and age. I
don't think it's an uncommon feeling. I just happened to have a few
historical things right, like India and Pakistan, which happened to
be in the news when I wrote it, and back it comes again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not a prophecy," he says. "It's just one of my
songs [about] that dread or the feeling of disaster that we all
experience these days. But it is a little spooky."</TE>

<LD>   'Friends' Survives 'Survivor: Africa' Finale</LD>
<LD>   In a head-to-head ratings battle between hit shows Thursday night,
an original episode of NBC's "Friends" beat the finale of "Survivor:
Africa," the third installment of the CBS unscripted series.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, however, CBS won the night, with an average of 24.5
million viewers in prime time compared to NBC's 21.6 million.
"Survivor" steadily built to more than 30 million viewers in its
final half-hour against the NBC sitcoms "Will &amp; Grace" and "Just
Shoot Me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, CBS' margin of victory was much slimmer than when
"Survivor: The Australian Outback" ended in May, underscoring
"Friends'" breakout popularity this season and suggesting that the
"Survivor" novelty is wearing off. Thursday's two-hour finale
averaged about 27.3 million viewers, down 25% from the second
edition's conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of "Survivor: Africa" was Ethan Zohn, a 27-year-old
soccer player from Lexington, Mass., who beat out retired teacher Kim
Johnson, 57, from Oyster Bay, N.Y., for the $1-million top prize.
Zohn said he'll use some of the money to start a soccer league for
children.</TE>

<TE>   Fox Tries Star Power to Boost Ratings of 'Ally'</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that ratings for "Ally McBeal" have been
disappointing this season, Fox is hoping some guest casting will help
revive the show, with actress Christina Ricci joining the series for
a five-episode arc later this year and Jon Bon Jovi coming aboard
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Ally" will take six weeks off beginning March 11, when Fox plans
to introduce "The American Embassy," a drama about a young woman
working at an embassy abroad. Originally titled "Emma Brody," the
series was renamed and its focus slightly altered after the events of
Sept. 11.</TE>

<TE>   Pasadena Civic Cancels Its Musical Series</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena Civic Auditorium's Musical Series, a combination of
dance and touring musicals, has been canceled because of falling
attendance, and the nonprofit Pasadena Civic Auditorium Foundation
that supported the series is dissolving.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Barr, president of the foundation, said an average
attendance of at least 50% was necessary to continue, and the overall
average since the series began in 1998 had fallen to 40% over the
last three months, when the series presented "Tap Dogs" and
"Nutcracker."</TE>
<TE>   The canceled shows are "Spartacus/Swan Lake," "Riverdance," "Annie
Get Your Gun" and "My Fair Lady." Ticket-holders have been sent full
refunds, said spokeswoman Leann Lampe. The closing of the series does
not affect other Pasadena Civic programming.</TE>

<TE>   San Diego Symphony Gift to Be $100 Million</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Symphony will receive a $100-million donation to its
endowment fund from local philanthropists Irwin and Joan Jacobs--$50
million of which will go into the fund now. Another $50 million will
be a bequest upon the death of both Jacobses.</TE>
<TE>   The symphony, financially resurgent after a bankruptcy
reorganization that began in 1996, currently has an endowment of just
$1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the gift began to leak earlier this week, when insiders
said it would be the largest individual donation ever to an American
orchestra, surpassing previous $40-million gifts to the St. Louis
Symphony and the Miami Beach-based New World Symphony. On Friday,
symphony officials affirmed the $100-million figure.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin Jacobs, 68, is the co-founder, chief executive and chairman
of the board at the San Diego-based wireless communications giant
Qualcomm.</TE>

<TE>   A Cut for the Arts in New State Budget</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Sept. 11, all California state agencies were
asked by the governor to cut 15% from their proposed budgets for
fiscal year 2002-2003, due to effects from the struggling economy
that were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks. So, all things
considered, the California Arts Council was pleasantly surprised to
find that its budget has received only a 7.7% reduction in its
general fund--about half what was expected--in the governor's
2002-2003 fiscal year budget released Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The new figures will shave $2.178 million from last year's general
funding budget of $32 million, the council said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't be able to reach the high-water mark of bringing the
arts into the 1,200 schools that we reached last year, but we are
encouraged that the economy will turn around," said Juan Carillo, the
council's chief of grant programs.</TE>
<TE>   The council will hold its first public meeting of 2002 in Los
Angeles at 1 p.m. Tuesday at Self Help Graphics &amp; Art, 3802 Cesar
Chavez Ave.</TE>

<TE>   The opening production of El Portal Center's mainstage season, a
Jule Styne revue called "Vamps," has been postponed indefinitely
because of a financial crunch faced by the company. It was to have
played Jan. 29 to Feb. 23. Company officials say the second show, "70
Girls 70," is still due to open in May at the North Hollywood venue.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Actors Alley company that operates from El Portal's
99-seat Circle Theatre has changed its name to the Company Rep; its
production of "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" is still slated for
mid-February.</TE>

<HD>Quartet Grandly Wraps Its Mozart, Bartok Cycle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American String Quartet has played them all now, splendidly and
in top form--all of Mozart's quintets and Bartok's quartets in a
six-year cycle in Founders Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   The cycle did not progress chronologically. On Thursday, the
group--violinists Peter Winograd and Laurie Carney, violist Daniel
Avshalomov and cellist David Geber--reached back to early works,
Mozart's first venture in the form, K. 174, and Bartok's Second
Quartet.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever problems Mozart had in working out the intricacies of the
form later, he seems to be glorying here in discovering the
possibilities of a second viola (guest Brian Dembow, of the Angeles
Quartet). It can add light or darkness to the texture, pair off in
various ways with other instruments or simply sing as the fifth voice
in the lovely operatic ensemble of the second movement. The
American's bright, forward and warm sound perfectly suited this
genial, lively work.</LD>
<TE>   The low number of Bartok's Second Quartet is deceptive. Composed
during World War I, when Bartok was in his mid-30s, the work reflects
little if any youthful optimism. His friend and fellow composer
Zoltan Kodaly labeled the three movements "A Quiet Life," "Joy" and
"Sorrow." But it's hard to imagine how he heard "quiet" in the
intense, compacted struggles of the first movement or "joy" in the
powerful rhythmic drive of the second. Mania might be a better word.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the last movement is sorrowful, although that word
doesn't quite capture the composer's portrayal of a desolate,
graveyard landscape. There are some hints but also some doubts of a
furious apocalyptic resurrection. The Americans made it a killer.</TE>
<TE>   They ended the program with Dvorak's bucolic Quartet in E flat,
Opus 51, for all the usual reasons. You don't end with the most
contemporary piece; you don't send the audience out in a suicidal
mood.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Dvorak's subdued, comforting piece seemed unequal
to the task of vanquishing Bartok's ghosts.</TE>

<HD>WB's 'Experiment' Is a Candid Form of Flattery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What if you put some change in a vending machine and it talked back?</LD>
<LD>   It was 1948 when a low-budget half hour titled "Candid Microphone"
made its debut on ABC, relocating to newfangled television from
radio.</LD>
<LD>   A year later it resumed on NBC with another name, "Candid Camera,"
and now, more than five decades later, Allen Funt's goofy little
hypothesis--that humor can be mined from snooping on unsuspecting
citizens with hidden mikes and cameras--is still being copied in
prime time. Funt is dead, but creative thievery isn't, guaranteeing
that his bit of genius will endure indefinitely, at times to viewer
advantage.</LD>
<TE>   The latest to mount this assembly line is "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy
Experiment," a new WB series affirming that you don't have to be
original to be funny. In this case, execution is what counts, with
Kennedy's hybrid of Funtisms and sketch comedy opening as a
knee-slapping half hour. It begins with Kennedy in the guise of a
rapper trying to impress the mother and sister of a college coed he
plans to marry. He is hilarious, as are their stunned responses to
the inspired silliness of this master scammer.</TE>
<TE>   Just as funny is the second segment that has Kennedy pretending to
be the insincere host of an infomercial selling a cooking appliance,
with a studio audience getting suckered by this setup that closely
resembles the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   Are the "victims" here really responding spontaneously or are they
as scripted as Kennedy? Who's to know? This is TV in 2002, however,
so viewers should be skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   A third segment, capturing on camera a woman starting a new job
with an employer who has a bit of a jaw problem, yields some laughs
as well. Kennedy is talented, and his new show promising. For once,
Funt the creator may not be twisting in his grave.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy Experiment" premieres Sunday night at 8
and 9:30 on the WB. The network has rated it TV-PG-L (may be
unsuitable for young children with a special advisory for coarse
language).</TE>

<HD>2 TV Game Shows Are Doing Battle</HD>
<DH>Networks: Fox countersues ABC in an ongoing legal dispute
over their soon-to-premiere programs, 'The Chamber' and 'The Chair.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A battle over competing game-show concepts "The Chamber" and "The
Chair" took a nasty and bizarre turn Friday as Fox countersued
producers of the rival ABC series, accusing them of engaging in "a
campaign" to undermine the Fox show that allegedly included sneaking
onto the set and trying to lure away staff to secure information
about the program.</LD>
<LD>   Touchdown Television, the New Zealand-based producer of "The
Chair," filed suit a week ago against Fox and Dick Clark Productions,
which is producing "The Chamber," alleging that Fox appropriated the
idea to develop a similarly themed show after it was pitched to the
network.</LD>
<LD>   Fox's countersuit, however, maintains "The Chamber" has been in
development at the network since June and that Andrew Golder, an
executive producer on "The Chair," was caught trespassing on the
program's closed set Thursday--the first night of
taping--surreptitiously seeking to obtain details about the show.</LD>
<TE>   "When Golder realized that [one of the producers] had seen him, he
attempted to flee," the suit contends. Fox and Clark also charge that
on several occasions since Dec. 24, Golder promised "The Chamber's"
contestant coordinator that she could "become a 'heavy hitter' if she
defected to their competing program, 'The Chair.'"</TE>
<TE>   Producers of "The Chair" could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fox announced Thursday that it would introduce "The Chamber" this
Sunday--a move made so late the program will not be mentioned in most
TV listings--to get it on the air prior to "The Chair," which is
scheduled to premiere Tuesday. Hosted by tennis commentator John
McEnroe, the ABC show features contestants hooked up to a monitor
measuring their heart rate while they answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chamber" also features a contestant fielding questions while
being monitored, only in this case the contestant is also subjected
to various "environmental stimuli"--including heat, cold, water and
wind--that become increasingly intense as the questioning progresses.</TE>
<TE>   Fox indicated that contestants would be monitored to keep an eye
on their health during the ordeal and that all players would be
subjected to thorough physical examinations before being allowed to
participate.</TE>
<TE>   Both networks are hoping they can promote their series,
particularly to elusive male viewers, during NFL playoff coverage
this weekend. ABC will televise back-to-back "wild card" games today,
while Fox will broadcast one of the two contests Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Fox will run "The Chamber" on Sunday night for two weeks before
the show settles into its regular time slot Fridays at 8 p.m. Both
networks have ordered limited trial runs of each series but clearly
hope such a variation on the traditional game-show format could
provide the next potential alternative programming hit.</TE>

<LD>Enough with the Ten Best Lists and all the awards. How about some
acknowledgement of the movies that left us holding our noses as we
left the theater last year (or, more likely, that most of us actively
avoided, thanks to trailers and TV ads that played more like alarm
bells than promotional fare)?</LD>
<LD>   Enter "Ebert &amp; Roeper," which devotes this week's half-hour
installment (6:30 p.m. Sunday, KABC) to the worst films of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Remember "Down to Earth," with Chris Rock? Or "Joe Dirt," with
David Spade? What about "Town &amp; Country," with Warren Beatty, Goldie
Hawn, Diane Keaton and Garry Shandling?</LD>
<TE>   These three and about a dozen more make the lists of critics Roger
Ebert and Richard Roeper. The choices are all safe and predictable,
leaving nothing for the pair to quibble about, except in the case of
"3000 Miles to Graceland," for which Roeper expresses mild regard
despite Ebert's trashing.</TE>
<TE>   The mandate at work here is simply to have fun; viewers interested
in analysis of why a film didn't work will have to look elsewhere.
The criticism doesn't go much beyond wisecracks, with most of the
blame being doled out to the performers rather than to writers,
directors, producers or studio executives. Of the star of "Corky
Romano," Roeper says, "There are 10,000 guys working at Kinkos and
they're all funnier than Chris Kattan." And "Domestic Disturbance"
prompts him to liken John Travolta's ability to find bombs in which
to appear to "a German shepherd on high alert."</TE>
<TE>   But if the commentary lacks incisiveness, the film clips do not.
When it comes to describing shortcomings, they speak eloquently.</TE>
<TE>   They're short, though, so you won't leave holding your nose.</TE>

<LD>"A Loyal Constituency Is Restless" (Opinion, Jan. 6), dealing with
the Catholics of California, could not have been more on the mark.
Those in the Democratic Party have become so dogmatic when it comes
to their radical social agenda that it boggles the mind that any
self-aware Catholic could support them today. After achieving
complete power in 1998, it was only a matter of time before, once
again, they ran home to their far-left universe, thereby successfully
alienating the populace.</LD>
<LD>   The budget disaster that is now upon us shows what the mindless
fiscal policies of their ever-growing nanny state will do for you
economically. Allowing same-sex marriage, forcing homosexuality upon
our schoolchildren and ramming abortion down everyone's throat--all
the while mocking any cultural institutions that oppose them--show
you the nightmare of depravity such an ideology leaves behind.</LD>
<LD>   In time, those of faith will, as they have in the past, discard
such degenerate souls and go about picking up the mess they left
behind. The only question is when.</LD>

<TE>   I had to laugh when I read Tony Quinn's piece on Catholics and the
Democratic Party. The phrase "the Catholic vote" is simply hilarious!
As long as my church has members such as Jerry Brown and William F.
Buckley, Tom Daschle and Pat Buchanan, and Martin Sheen and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, "the Catholic vote" will remain just a pollster's
joke.</TE>
<TE>   George Bentley</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Carlin is quoted as questioning how a Catholic can be a
Democrat when the Democratic Party rejects Christian values. This
statement purports that the Roman Catholic Church is the defining
authority of such values. This is far from factual. While this
religion can claim to be the oldest espousing the teachings of Jesus
of Nazareth, it long ago lost its hold on Christianity in general.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that a great many Catholics define themselves as such
because their parents did so. When it comes to living in the real
world, a great many American Catholics are simply Christian rather
than Catholic in their behavior.</TE>

<TE>   Catholic voters are restless? What about the rest of us, who don't
care to have someone else's religion enacted into law? Proponents of
any religion need to understand that a religious belief is one's own
and, in the United States, one is free to practice it. That freedom,
however, does not include the right to enact into law, which affects
everyone, the tenets of that particular belief. What is so hard to
understand about that?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding the Jan. 7 article about Koreans' use of dogs as a food
source ("Culinary Flap Dogs S. Korea"): As an ethical vegetarian
myself, I am opposed to the cruel use of all animals for food, but
what is most appalling about using dogs for meat is the persistent
belief that the adrenaline brought by the torturing of the animal
before its death enhances the potency, nutrition or flavor of the
meat and that this imagined benefit therefore justifies the barbaric
cruelty.</LD>
<LD>   Men and their stupid potency problems have caused the senseless
slaughter of millions and millions of animals throughout time. I
thought--and hoped like heck!--Viagra would finally put an end to it,
but somehow the bright, shining light of reason and science seems
unable to conquer these nutty human superstitions.</LD>
<LD>   Will someone please wake me up when we at last enter the 21st
century and, in the meantime, to which animal rights group do I send
my check?</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer Horsman</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals once again rears its
empty head. People deserve rights and respect, not animals. It is
wrong for this animal rights organization to disrespect other
cultures by goading them into changing their lifestyles to fit into
its own twisted idea of morality. Livestock is livestock, be it
chicken, cow, goat or dog. Unless a species is facing extinction,
there is nothing immoral about eating it.</TE>
<TE>   That said, America's own cuisine could benefit from more variety.
While many Americans may cringe at the thought of eating something
other than a dry old chicken breast, I'm sure a few (myself included)
would be delighted to have the opportunity to try something out of
the ordinary. Braised parrot, mice glazed with honey or dog a
l'orange anyone?</TE>

<TE>   You can be forgiven the account of the disturbed boy in Florida

Plane Carried Note of Sympathy for Bin Laden") and, possibly, even
the picture of an orphan girl in Afghanistan "disciplining" another
with what appears to be a stout stick ("Poor Afghan Parents Give
Children Up as Orphans").</TE>
<TE>   But the stomach-churning story about South Korean gourmets eating
dogs? Couldn't your editors have been considerate enough to relegate
the dog-meat story to an inside page or leave it to the supermarket
tabloids?</TE>

<LD>Richard Rodriguez is right to ask Americans to use this historic
moment to examine their religious beliefs and root out any incipient
fanaticism ("A Religious Moment," Opinion, Jan. 6). But while we're
cleaning house, why not rid ourselves of mainstream religion as well?</LD>
<LD>   Even moderate, "reasonable" churches share what has for thousands
of years proved to be a recipe for disaster. They teach that there is
one God; that his followers constitute some sort of chosen people;
that these followers must do his work on Earth either by converting,
enslaving, persecuting, butchering or at least feeling superior to
everybody else; that the church's leaders are good and wise and
should be admired and trusted, no matter how preposterous their
public claims or how abominable their private behavior; and that all
of this should be injected into the minds of the very young, before
their innate sense of reason has developed far enough to reject it
for the poisonous nonsense it is.</LD>
<LD>   Every day atheists walk around doing decent, ethical things--not
in order to curry heavenly favor or escape hellish punishment but
because it's the right way to behave--and live to tell about it.
Large numbers of people have tried going a week without smoking or
watching TV, with admirable results. How about a week without God?</LD>
<TE>   Monte Montgomery</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's piece was wise and timely, and needs to be repeated
loud and often. It is ironic that we denounce Islamic movements for
wanting to take over governments, impose a fundamentalist regime,
enact their beliefs into law and restrict the practice of other
religions. The religious right in this country sees nothing wrong
with all that, as long as the state religion is fundamentalist
Christianity. Thank God for the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Jan C. Gabrielson</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I take great exception to Rodriguez's belief that "organized
religion has done more good than harm in the world." What I do
believe is that spirituality has done more good than harm in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Religion, in my opinion, is man's explanation for his personal
understanding of spirituality. Since each person understands a higher
power somewhat differently, by having "organized religion" we have
placed the members of each of these religions--Christians, Jews,
Muslims, Buddhists, etc., and all the offshoots of each of
these--into a competition to prove that their understanding of
spirituality is the one true religion.</TE>
<TE>   Spirituality, on the other hand, is of "one's own understanding";
it does not try or care to convince anyone else that he or she should
believe as others do. I do agree with Rodriguez that America was
founded on a secular ideal, but I propose that that secular ideal
would be best served by spirituality rather than religion.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Delman</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santa Margarita</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez rightly suggests that a free, secular society, far from
discouraging religious growth, actually enhances it. It does so, I
submit, by providing us the freedom without which the public
expression of "belief," which requires free choice, could not exist.</TE>

<LD>Re "Jobless Rate Nears a 7-Year High; Political Debate Shifts," Jan.
5: The typical "Republican mentality" strikes again. Who cares if the
unemployed, the poverty-stricken, the less fortunate are in trouble
if we have the power to cut taxes for wealthy business owners?
Unemployment rates have been steadily rising since George W. Bush set
foot in the White House but, luckily, Sept. 11 took the spotlight
away from the slumping economy and countless layoffs and directed
Americans' anger toward Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The economy's trouble is not the infamous Bin Laden, it is the
incompetence of those in power to provide sufficient aid to the
unemployed. The war on terrorism quickly and less than efficiently
emptied our budget surplus and turned it into a depressing, negative
figure. And yet Bush remains a hero--the public's approval of him
skyrockets to a whopping 90%--when all he managed to do was quietly
and quickly shift focus away from his follies to his "strength as a
leader" in a time of crisis. As abruptly as the war on terrorism will
end, so will Bush's time on America's pedestal.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Bush really is the compassionate conservative he claims he is,
in return for the tax breaks that he is pushing for corporate America
he should get promises from corporate CEOs to rehire the thousands of
employees they let go in the past year. Otherwise, he should drop
this wasteful corporate tax-break scheme and funnel the money into
extended unemployment benefits for the thousands of unemployed
workers trying to get by.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Bush Signals Possibility of Deficit in New Budget," Jan. 8:
Let's see. The Democrats spend too much, then balance the budget
through taxes. They are labeled the "Tax and Spend" Party. The
Republicans of late spend too much, then completely blow the budget
by giving out tax cuts. I guess they should be labeled the "Spend and
Spend" Party.</TE>

<TE>   In the 2000 campaign, George Bush said that the Democrats
squandered opportunities. If Bill Clinton had squandered a
$237-billion surplus in less than a year in office, the Republicans
would have eaten him alive. Sept. 11 and the recession did not drain
this huge amount of funds. Thank you, Mr. President.</TE>

<LD>This wasn't the first time I had been racially profiled and being a
black man, I know it won't be the last. This time, my kids--a
5-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter--and I were making our way
through the men's department at Target in Granada Hills when I turned
my head and caught the eye of a white woman, mid-30s, browsing
through the sweaters. In a voice well beyond a whisper I heard her
say, "Ma, watch your purse." My kids and I had just breezed by "Ma."
I glanced back to notice Ma placing her purse under her arm and
applying something that resembled a chokehold.</LD>
<LD>   And as I said, this wasn't the first time. I remember walking into
a shoe store, my same adorable kids in tow, and noticed a couple of
other children playing on the floor. The mom, about two feet away,
yelled to one of them as my kids and I approached, "Get my purse!"</LD>
<LD>   The other incidents have played out nearly the same way. The
people have always been white women and the thing they usually are
protecting is the purse.</LD>
<TE>   These women's paranoia may have been justified. Maybe they were
victims of crimes once. But I have a hard time believing that I fit
the profile of a purse snatcher. As an actor, I am cast to play many
different roles, but never a mugger or thief. I always play
professionals such as lawyers, doctors, teachers and dads. I'd like
to audition for thuggish roles but no matter how hard I try to rough
up my image, I end up looking like the professional having a bad day.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just black men who are looked upon with suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   After the tragedy of Sept. 11, I, along with millions of other
Americans, have been on the lookout for suspicious-looking Arab men.
Which is every Arab man when you're on the "lookout." And I must
admit to being slightly amused when I overheard some of these men
complaining about being questioned by law enforcement solely based on
their ethnicity. Of course I understand the seriousness of the
situation, but it was nice to hear some other group complaining about
being profiled.</TE>
<TE>   But profiling isn't just for white women and police agencies. As a
father I find profiling useful and necessary. When my daughter was a
few months old my wife and I were in need of a nanny. We met with the
owner of a particular agency whom I did not like because his face
looked like it belonged on a wanted poster.</TE>
<TE>   I profile my kids' friends. I'm cautious of the ones who lack
self-discipline and defy my authority. I profile parents because I
like rules. I like boundaries. And when those fail, I like
discipline. Therefore, I steer clear of parents who appear not to set
limits for their kids.</TE>
<TE>   I can't avoid being profiled. I accept it as being a part of who I
am. And who people think I am. Also, I can't avoid profiling others.
Even white women. For instance I may strike fear in some of them, but
some white women strike fear in me. Particularly the ones who drive
SUVs.</TE>

<LD>Lots of folks lost sleep after Sept. 11. The attacks knocked the
equilibrium right out from under us. But look at it this way: If you
lost sleep, you probably at least had the luxury of a bed to sleep
in.</LD>
<LD>   I run one of the community-based, nonprofit "safety-net"
organizations that make it into the headlines every holiday season.
We take care of homeless people. We walk the streets of skid row
looking for people who need our services, and then we help them,
first with emergency food and shelter and a bed to sleep in, then
permanent housing. We've done this work for 16 years. It's a tough
job.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people come to my organization every month. We take
care of crack- and heroin-addicted pregnant women, adults with HIV
and others with serious mental illness, chronic substance use and
histories of sexual and physical abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Mostly, though, our clients are regular folks who get sick and
lose a job or a spouse or their home and suddenly land on skid row.
The people we treat have hit bottom with nowhere else to go. We do
what we can, and we have many success stories. But this past season,
unlike any other holiday season we can remember at Homeless Health
Care, we feel like we're fighting the battle and starting to take
some heavy casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Federal money for homelessness services? Well, the McKinney Act of
1987 provides a little money--about the same amount it provided in
1987. And the Bush administration's budget proposes a huge,
$400-million cut for hospitals that serve the poor.</TE>
<TE>   State money? There is some, but Gov. Gray Davis' pending budget
has cuts or delays for programs like Healthy Families, and big cuts
for county programs that are funded by the state, put our efforts at
risk.Ever since the fall, when the recession began and Sept. 11
happened, those of us who run safety-net organizations have felt
overwhelmed. Almost two-thirds of California's safety-net agencies
now have more clients, according to a recent California Cares survey.
It makes sense: More people out of work equals a greater need for
services.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the worst part: When the need increases, usually
corporations, foundations and individuals increase their support and
give more. Not this time. Most of the safety-net organizations have
seen donations decrease during the past few months.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Corporations, foundations and individual donors have diverted
their regular giving to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry," they tell us, "but we gave to the victims of the
terrorists, and now we're tapped out." And the diversion has been
huge. The seven largest Sept. 11 funds now have collected more than
$1.2 billion--more than the need.</TE>
<TE>   I feel a lot of sympathy for the terrorists' victims and the
survivors. Who wouldn't? But our clients are victims too. Most of the
people who lost their jobs and their homes right here in Los Angeles
worked at minimum-wage restaurants or the airports or tourist
attractions. They can't pay their rent, feed their families or keep
up with California's ridiculous energy bills.</TE>
<TE>   Like most people, I mourn our dead. I know their families have
been through a tremendous ordeal. Yes, their survivors have to deal
with the grief of a sudden, violent death, and I wouldn't wish that
horror on anyone.</TE>
<TE>   But I wouldn't wish the horror of homelessness on anyone, either.
Think you lost sleep? Try sleeping in a cardboard box on a sidewalk
on skid row with your children for a few nights.</TE>
<TE>   Do what you can for New York, but don't forget the homefront. As
the ads say, give generously to your local charities. I promise
you'll sleep better.</TE>

<HD>Square Mile of Reminder</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Manzanar, a square-mile plot at the base of the eastern Sierra where
as many as 10,000 Japanese Americans were interned during World War
II, takes on renewed meaning after Sept. 11. It is a reminder of what
can happen to constitutional rights and freedoms even in America. It
is equally a tribute to the loyalty of the internees, most of them
American citizens. Many an interned family's son enlisted to fight
for the United States.</LD>
<LD>   It is good news, then, that work will at last begin on a memorial
and visitor center at Manzanar. It's been a decade since Congress
established the national historic site.</LD>
<LD>   The government built Manzanar in 1942, when post-Pearl Harbor
fears ran high. It sits between the towns of Lone Pine and
Independence, in the Owens Valley some 200 miles north of Los
Angeles. The starkly beautiful setting at the foot of 14,384-foot Mt.
Williamson is bleak, hard ground, burned by a harsh sun in summer and
freezing winds in winter.</LD>
<TE>   When the camp was closed in 1946, nearly all the buildings were
sold off. The only sizable remaining structure is the old auditorium,
which was used for years by Inyo County road maintenance crews. The
auditorium will be rebuilt and restored to be the visitor center and
National Park Service offices. As The Times' Bettina Boxall reported
Monday, construction is scheduled to begin in the spring and the
center to open sometime in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service plans to reconstruct the eight guard towers that
surrounded the barbed-wire enclosure. A call has gone out for any
surviving buildings among those that were carted away so many years
ago. Inyo County will return a structure that was a mess hall and a
county hospital. The Park Service hopes eventually to re-create a
block of barracks.</TE>
<TE>   Memorializing Manzanar has been controversial. Some Inyo County
residents insisted that the internees deserved to be confined and
that conditions were not all that harsh. Former internees, on the
other hand, believe Manzanar should be referred to as a
''concentration camp.'' The Park Service is settling for the blander
''war location center.'' Because of the local opposition, and the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power's unfounded fear that it would
lose some water rights, the project had languished.</TE>
<TE>   Once built, the historic site will help Americans better
understand a dark chapter in their history. A spokeswoman for former
internees says they are anxious to see the work done before they die.
The nation owes them that.</TE>

<HD>A Verdict--and a Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The affair is full of such pure pathos and sadness that almost
everyone will be struck by some detail. We're talking about the
so-called "hockey dad" homicide trial, which ended Friday with an
involuntary manslaughter verdict and a possible prison term of three
to five years. Other than its Massachusetts ice rink locale, the
deadly confrontation really had little to do with hockey. It should
be the "macho parent" trial, which would require more of us to do
some honest self-examination. This may be the larger lesson for those
who so enjoy watching and encouraging our children to exercise their
bodies and minds in earnest amateur athletic competition.</LD>
<LD>   The case facts are simple: Some boys were playing pickup hockey
loosely supervised by one dad. Age 12 is when "checking," physically
skating into an opponent who has the puck, becomes legal. One doting
father, a 275-pound truck driver named Thomas Junta, confronted the
volunteer coach, a 156-pound father named Michael Costin, whose sons
were also on the ice, playing on the rougher, losing team, as it
happened.</LD>
<TE>   Junta said hockey's "about having fun." He thought the play was
too rough. Costin actually agreed; he had just urged the boys to ease
up a bit. But to this challenging stranger, Costin uttered a
peremptory retort that hockey was rough. Within minutes the larger
father who objected to too much rough play was beating to death the
smaller father who agreed but wouldn't back down. And the children
watched. How's that for avoidable tragedy?</TE>
<TE>   Parents are genetically programmed to protect their young. We
willingly give them up to learn from professional teachers out of our
sight in schools. Then, we drive our children to sports and willingly
deliver them to volunteers to teach right before our eyes. We cheer.
We groan. We worry about injuries. We wince over mistakes and hope
they do their best. But if parents are honest, at times we also
quietly question (and sometimes not quietly) this coach-person down
there suddenly controlling our child's fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we think the coach ought to play our child more, be a little
kinder, more understanding to this precious youngster and, by the
way, not yell quite so loudly or berate so harshly. It's a game,
right? Anyway, we hope our children learn the rules of the game and
also the skills of winning and losing with different teammates and
bosses. That's the obvious part.</TE>
<TE>   It's exciting and gratifying to see our offspring learn and
improve and still eagerly look over for our smiles and applause.
What's less obvious under the emotional pressures of such surrogate
competition is that even as dedicated, determined and devoted
spectators, the protective parents too should be learning--
ultimately, to let their children go. It's hard to hover and not
interfere emotionally, to balance protection with overprotection as
they grow up. But it is the grown-up thing to do.</TE>

<LD>Have you noticed how some of our conversational protocols changed
over recent months? How we quickly adopted new words and expressions
or adapted old ones? And maybe even behaved with less impatient
fidgeting and whispering during the national anthem?</LD>
<LD>   Anyone receiving holiday newsletters from distant friends spotted
the newly obligatory nod to grief or apology for untimely happiness.
"Of course, we were all deeply saddened by the tragic events of Sept.
11," they'd begin, "but were delighted when daughter Elizabeth
delivered our first grandchild on.... " That sympathetic format
emerged early when mere acquaintances asked, "How are you doing?" For
long weeks we all knew what they meant, though the singular meaning
finally faded.</LD>
<TE>   With global communications now virtually instant, many major news
events produce new words or expressions that provide revealing little
windows into the passing priorities, preoccupations and peccadilloes
of a society; think "Y2K" and "chad." Not long ago, "9/11" was just
an emergency phone number and a "Taliban" was, who knows, maybe some
kind of Caribbean deck boss? "Burka" was not a word widely understood
to suggest oppression of women. "Mullah" sounded like dated slang for
money. Few associated the name Rudy with inspiring leadership.
"Homeland security" resembled the rallying cry of a desperate
dictator losing ground. We also heard some familiar words a lot more:
"Stunned," "stunning," "shocked," "shocking," "horrific" and
"unprecedented" were used a shockingly unprecedented number of times.
Once, "bombs" were awful but just bombs. Then, first in the Persian
Gulf War and again today, bombs were "smart" or "laser-guided." Or
worn by suicide bombers. "Training camps," once reserved for
preseason baseball and football teams, now belonged to "terrorists"
and were soon to become "rubble."</TE>
<TE>   Some of these wartime words, images and meanings will fade. Some
will survive intact, while others morph over time into even newer
meanings in always-elastic English. Before it became an everyday
word, "snafu" was a soldier's vulgar acronym for a fouled-up military
bureaucracy, while having "shot the whole nine yards" meant being in
real trouble because fighter plane machine gun ammunition belts were
27 feet long.</TE>

<HD>India's Muslims Are Part of a Secular State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mansoor Ijaz mentions the right of Kashmiris to self-determination in
Indian-ruled Kashmir ("Pakistan Can Defuse the Kashmir Crisis,"
Commentary, Jan. 9). Pakistan rules the other third of Kashmir, and
it is virtually devoid of non-Muslims, thanks to state-sponsored
ethnic cleansing. The non-Muslim Kashmiris who were driven to secular
India have rights, too. So do those who were driven out from the rest
of Pakistan to India. Had India behaved like Pakistan, Muslims
wouldn't be a majority in Kashmir and would be a tiny minority in the
rest of India today.</LD>
<LD>   Permanent peace between India and Pakistan requires far more than
the resolution of the Kashmir conflict. It depends on the Pakistani
Muslims learning to coexist with non-Muslims in the region.</LD>
<LD>   Moorthy Muthuswamy</LD>
<TE>   Coram, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ijaz is right in arguing that Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf's best strategy is to remove "each part of the argument New
Delhi's hard-liners have used against Islamabad on the terrorism
issue." While this series of moves may bolster Musharraf's support
among "Pakistan's moderate political class," as Ijaz argues, it may
also cause these moderates to view Musharraf merely as a puppet
controlled by India and/or the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The key is for Musharraf to accomplish all this before hard-liners
in the military or Islamic radicals can seriously threaten his rule,
while providing tangible evidence of progress in achieving a just
resolution to the Kashmir dispute. If the world community is serious
about a stable and secure Pakistan, then it should start becoming
serious about Kashmiri self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   Arif Rafiq</TE>
<TE>   Greenvale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ijaz misses the point in arguing that Hindu nationalists "seek to
control Kashmir's Muslims." The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party leads a coalition of different political parties and has been
in charge of India for the last three years only. Kashmir's Muslims
are just a tiny minority of India's Muslim population. Ijaz is wrong
in painting a picture that undermines India's secular constitution by
trying to justify Kashmir's crisis because of its Muslim majority.
The logic may suit Pakistan because that country is an Islamic
theocracy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Principal Plays to Student Potential, Not Failure," Jan. 2: As
one of the assistant principals at Jordan High School I have had an
opportunity to observe and interact with the principal, Dhyan Lal.
Dr. Lal has provided an ongoing academic staff development program to
help teachers become more proficient in their classrooms. He has made
sure his vice principals and coordinators visit the classrooms on a
daily basis to ensure that meaningful instruction is taking place. At
every opportunity during the school day, Lal and the rest of his
administrative staff remind and counsel students that it is their
responsibility to absorb and learn the academic instruction that
their teachers are providing.</LD>
<TE>   As a Mexican American educator I was very puzzled by the article's
portrayal of Lal as using bigoted language. It referred to Lal saying
to a Latino staff member, "Did you eat your burritos today?" This was
an incident that involved me. Lal and I are both a "few pounds"
overweight and are always trying to help each other count calories.
Thus, when he asked if I had eaten burritos that day that were made
for us by a well-intentioned and good-hearted school employee, I
simply replied that I did not know someone had made burritos for us.
I knew that Lal was trying to help me with my diet, but apparently
your reporter did not. This was certainly not an ethnic slur. Lal
would never, and I mean never, involve himself with such language.</TE>

<LD>Re "Veteran Pilot's Fatal Nose Dive Perplexes Family and Officials,"
Jan. 8: Pilots who do dumb things give the entire industry a bad
name. A person wouldn't try to start his or her car without putting
the key in the ignition. Deploying the landing gear on a plane prior
to landing is just that elemental.</LD>
<LD>   There is a set procedure to flying. Follow the procedure and
flying is as safe as riding a bicycle. Failure to follow the
procedures set down in the checklist or manual compares to playing

<LD>Now that even the administration has recognized that its policy of
unilateralism has been an abject failure (i.e., the brewing war in
Israel, the rising tensions along the Pakistani-Indian border),
perhaps it's time to view the war effort under the same microscope.</LD>
<LD>   Our leadership's apparent unwillingness to put our troops on the
ground to cut off escape routes from Tora Bora allowed Osama bin
Laden and the majority of the Al Qaeda leadership to escape.</LD>
<LD>   In an apparent attempt to prosecute a war without casualties, I
fear we have put our soldiers at an even greater peril, as they will
now be forced to pursue a regrouping Al Qaeda into hostile territory
and Bin Laden, quite probably, into the bosom of a heavily armed
aggressor nation like Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, Bin Laden may be marshaling his forces for
another attack on American soil, putting all of us at risk. I think
history will view this as a colossal military blunder, the
consequences of which we may not begin to understand for some time.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Questions Lurk in a Dead Village," Jan. 8: So the bombing of
Qalaye Niazi in Afghanistan may have been a "mistake," the result of
faulty information given to the Americans by vindictive informants.
Or perhaps it was not a mistake. Perhaps there may have been Taliban
soldiers mingling with the population. The assumption is that if the
latter is true, there is nothing to be uncomfortable about. If a few
women and children, fleeing for safety, happen to get blown into
little pieces, it can't be avoided. This is war, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Why is no one questioning this logic? Why are the deaths of those
Afghan civilians any less heinous than the deaths of the American
citizens killed in the terrorist attacks?</TE>
<TE>   I have the sense that I have either gone mad or else the rest of
the country has. What happened to all the talk of tolerance for
others, of our common humanity in this ever-shrinking world? Has fear
obliterated all that? God, I hope not!</TE>

<TE>   In his recent tape, Bin Laden, as do a few others, places all the
blame for Muslim terrorism on Israel. Each day we read of Muslim
terrorism directed against non-Muslims in India, Russia, Africa and
the Philippines. In what way can Israel be responsible for the
killing of innocent civilians in those countries?</TE>

<TE>   It is absurd to bring Afghanistan Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to
Guantanamo Bay for interrogation ("U.S. Troops Leave for Cuba to Set
Up Afghan War Prison," Jan. 7). To carry these brutal fighters
halfway around the world, have them questioned and then take them
back to their country is costly and frivolous. Now that there is a
government that we established in Afghanistan, it is up to the
Afghans to take over the job of housing and questioning these
fighters--along with assistance from U.S. military or other federal
services. Say "no" to bringing these deadly terrorists to the U.S.
base, from which they may be able to work their way into the U.S.</TE>

<TE>   Daniel Pipes identifies correctly the one force that may
effectively combat militant Islam in the world: moderate, diverse and
empowered Muslim groups (Commentary, Jan. 6). Healthy political
struggle in Muslim regimes, the way Madison envisioned it to function
in America, is something that will eventually paralyze militant
Islam.</TE>
<TE>   It is certainly in America's interest to understand the nature of
credible Muslim opposition against militant Islam and to sustain its
efforts the way it has with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. As
Pipes suggests, this may be the only means by which commonalities
between the West and Islam may be preserved in the presence of
militant Islam, rather than be destroyed by it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The U.S. Adoption Snake Pit" (Commentary, Jan. 6), John Balzar
laments the U.S. process of private adoptions and points to China's
national adoption agency as a more straightforward and effective
system. I certainly agree that the U.S. adoption process has
challenges, but it has made great progress over the years,
particularly in the area of foster care adoptions. Today in America
there are more than 130,000 children in foster care who will never go
back to their biological families--not because they themselves did
anything wrong but because their birth parents weren't protective and
nurturing caretakers. Finding loving, permanent homes for them will
create a better reality--and future--for these children.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to changes in state and federal law, adoption from foster
care is easier than ever before--regardless of age, gender, race or
marital status. And adopting children from foster care is virtually
free. Congress has made federal tax credits available to help offset
costs, and many companies and government agencies offer adoption
benefits, including time off for "maternity leave" and financial
assistance. Now, all these children need is a leap of faith and
courage from adults with love to share.</LD>
<TE>   The Children's Action Network is committed to finding permanent
homes for children living in foster care. By spearheading the
National Adoption Campaign we are working to raise awareness of the
need for adoption and to streamline the system to support prospective
families throughout the adoption process.</TE>

these VIPs collected put into a pool and distributed to those poor

<DL>SAN SIMEON</DL>
<LD>The radio crackles. A voice descends from the heavens, from
all-seeing eyes in the sky.</LD>
<LD>   "Three guys on the rocks just below the pier. One has a bucket.
Can you handle?"</LD>
<LD>   Copy that.</LD>
<TE>   Lt. Jorge Gross, a state Fish and Game warden, swings his dark
green pickup back onto California 1. Following directions from a
warden in a plane overhead, he races off in pursuit of suspected
abalone poachers.</TE>
<TE>   California's central coast is prime poaching territory for black
abalone for a good reason. It's one of the few places where there are
any left.</TE>
<TE>   A recent winter day seemed perfect for "rock-pickers," as abalone
poachers are called.</TE>
<TE>   The ocean has pulled far back; a minus tide exposed the abundant
sea life clinging to the rocky shoreline. The late-afternoon sun is
an orange blob, ready to be swallowed by the sea, making anyone on
the rocks hard to see.</TE>
<TE>   So Gross joined half a dozen other wardens racing along California
1 to locate poachers before darkness allows them to slip away unseen.
The race never seems to end as wardens mount a desperate attempt to
save the remnant population of a vanishing species.</TE>
<TE>   Pity the lowly black abalone. For decades, it was dismissed as a
trash shellfish more suitable for bait than a gastronomic treat. It
is smaller and its flesh far tougher than its more delectable
cousins: the red, white, green and pink abalone.</TE>
<TE>   But when fishermen had picked the sea floor clean of other
species, they turned their pry bars on black abalone, pulling them
off rocks in the shallows where they live.</TE>
<TE>   Black abalone that eluded harvesting were claimed by insidious
bacteria that disrupt their digestive system so they wither and
eventually die of starvation.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists estimate that 99% of the millions of black abalone that
once inhabited coastal waters off California are gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Extinction rarely happens for any one reason," said Konstantin
Karpov, a biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game.
"It usually takes cumulative impacts to knock an animal off the
planet."</TE>
<TE>   That's why he and other abalone experts worry. Poachers often
think that their small harvest will make little difference, wardens
say. Yet, the poachers' prey represent the few remaining black
abalone likely to be resistant to the fatal withering syndrome. Their
survival offers the only hope for the species.</TE>
<TE>   Any poaching, as wardens like to say, is a recipe for disaster.</TE>
<TE>   It has been illegal to harvest any type of abalone from Southern
and Central California since 1997, when wildlife officials realized
that size limits and other management techniques had failed.</TE>
<TE>   The only legal harvest is of red abalone in the cold, murky waters
north of San Francisco by sport divers who are barred from using
scuba tanks or other underwater breathing devices.</TE>
<TE>   Such free-divers are now limited to three red abalone a day, and a
maximum of 24 a year. The catch limits were lowered last month by the
state Fish and Game Commission, partly in reaction to intensive
poaching.</TE>
<TE>   The price of abalone continues to surge on a black market, where
one abalone can fetch as much as $100. Often, the illegal catch is
smuggled overseas to Asia, where it is sold in top sushi restaurants
as a rare delicacy or in traditional medicine shops as an
aphrodisiac.</TE>
<TE>   Larger poaching rings focus on red abalone along the northern
coast, where poachers sometimes scuba dive at night to avoid
detection.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their deeper-dwelling cousins, black abalone are the most
vulnerable to human hands because they live in the tidal shallows.
These ear-shaped mollusks are often left exposed or within easy reach
during the lowest tides.</TE>
<TE>   So poachers focus on isolated stretches of the central coast. The
craggy shoreline provides countless hiding places, mainly tide pools
that are often difficult to spot by wardens patrolling California 1.</TE>
<TE>   That's why every few months, Warden Drew Brandy clamors in a
twin-prop observation plane owned by the Fish and Game department.
Flying about 500 feet above the surf and using powerful binoculars,
he can easily pick out humans squatting among the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   "It is too remote for a warden to check all of these areas,"
Brandy said. "The bad guys get on these private ranches and think
they have carte blanche."</TE>
<TE>   So, all afternoon Brandy is radioing reports of suspicious
characters on the rocks, directing officers below in their dark green
pickups to head for Cayucos, Moonstone Beach, Piedras Blancas and the
cliffs just above San Simeon Point.</TE>
<TE>   Gross and two other wardens converge at one spot. They hop a
barbed wire fence and stroll warily across pastures that hold the
Hearst Ranch's prized bulls. From the bluff top, they scan the beach
for one fellow that Brandy has reported in a white shirt and blue
backpack.</TE>
<TE>   "Got a visual?" Brandy asks from the plane circling overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "No, not yet," Gross reports from the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The cat-and-mouse game continues as the sun sets. Wardens try to
match each vehicle parked along California 1 with people as they come
up the bluffs.</TE>
<TE>   Gross greets a family of five as it emerges from a steep
embankment. Two girls are carrying shells. A 12-year-old boy holds a
starfish upside-down in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant frowns. He explains that if everyone took home a
starfish or other critter, there would be nothing left.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, we're not supposed to have it?" the father asks.</TE>
<TE>   "No, you are not supposed to have it."</TE>
<TE>   Gross could have written a ticket for the offense. Instead, he
offers to return the starfish to the tide pool from which it was
removed. The family gratefully accepts his offer and hurries away.</TE>
<TE>   During the previous day's operation, Gross belly-crawled to a
bluff top to bust a poacher with an illegal bucketful of owl limpets.
He wrote tickets for fishermen for undersized cabezon and others for
using a gaff to skewer baby octopuses from their hiding holes in the
rocks. (Octopuses can be caught only by hand or fished by hook and
line.)</TE>
<TE>   But on this day, neither Gross nor any other warden comes upon a
single abalone poacher.</TE>
<TE>   All of the green pickup trucks converge on one isolated spot so
the wardens can compare notes and await a trio of people who have not
returned to their van even though it is long past dark.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, wow, what's going on?" asks a longhaired, bearded mountain
biker emerging from the darkness. He takes a few steps back as he
notices uniformed wardens and their trucks. "Nothing fishy on me,
honest," he says, holding up his hands in surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the eye-in-the-sky operations result in seizing buckets
of abalone and citing a dozen poachers. Not today.</TE>
<TE>   Is the word finally getting out about the plight of the abalone or
about the wardens' aggressive enforcement tactics? Or are the wardens
just unlucky?</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's good," Gross says, none too confidently. "In the big
picture, we want compliance. But as a warden, you always think you
are at the wrong place at the wrong time."</TE>

<HD>Amtrak May Face Rail Competition</HD>
<DH>Transit: A panel recommends allowing private companies to
compete with the agency to operate trains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal panel studying the future of the ailing Amtrak rail system
on Friday recommended opening intercity rail service to
competition--a move that if approved would end Amtrak's monopoly of
the service.</LD>
<LD>   The Amtrak Reform Council voted 8 to 1 to recommend allowing
private companies across the country the chance to compete with
Amtrak to operate the trains.</LD>
<LD>   The council is due to deliver its recommendations to Congress on
Feb. 7, likely setting off a legislative debate over the future of
the troubled system.</LD>
<TE>   Despite projections after the Sept. 11 attacks that train
ridership would increase over the long term, the number of train
travelers has leveled off and Amtrak--already in debt for nearly $3
billion--is continuing to lose money.</TE>
<TE>   Repeatedly on Friday, panel members expressed their desire to
develop a modern, efficient rail system that continues to serve
long-haul routes as well as high-density commuter corridors such as
the popular Los Angeles-San Diego route.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is produce a new national rail passenger
system that works and is modern and meets the needs of this country
and this century," said Gil Carmichael, the council's chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for Amtrak to transfer ownership of the Northeast
Corridor from Washington to Boston, and to give up other assets
including tracks, tunnels and stations, which would be distributed
among state, federal and private entities. The railroad would
continue to run trains under the supervision of a new government
corporation during a transition period of at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   Panel members said the operation of passenger rail service should
be similar to other forms of national transportation, such as
interstate highways and air travel, where the government funds
infrastructure and private corporations operate passenger services.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the panel called for the federal government to create
a new trust fund for railway infrastructure, and to allow increased
flexibility in how state and local governments use federal
transportation funds.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also recommended that Congress pass a tax incentive to
reward private investment in rail facilities and invest as much
decision-making authority as possible to regional or state entities.</TE>
<TE>   The Amtrak Reform Council was formed in 1997 under the Amtrak
Reform and Accountability Act, which also kept the nearly bankrupt
rail line in operation.</TE>

<HD>Disclosure Is Latest Blow to Andersen</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Auditor's admission to destroying Enron
records may prove crippling to firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH and JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andersen's admission that it destroyed thousands of documents
involving Enron Corp. may deal a crippling blow to one of America's
oldest accounting companies, accounting experts said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "When the watchdog for the public turns out to be the dog that ate
the papers, there is a big problem," said Lynn Turner, the former
chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission, who now
heads the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State
University.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based firm told investigators this week that it had
destroyed thousands of electronic and paper documents in September,
October and November.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time documents were being trashed, Enron was
disclosing damaging new financial information. On Oct. 16, Enron
reported $638 million in losses and a $1.2-billion reduction in
shareholder equity. And on Nov. 8 the company revised its financial
statements, slashing $586 million from profit to account for losses
over a four-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was both Enron's auditor and a major consulting partner,
at one point collecting $1 million a week in fees.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said that its staff destroyed documents before receiving
a subpoena from the SEC in November. After that, the firm issued
instructions to preserve any documents related to Enron, but it isn't
sure its orders were followed.</TE>
<TE>   "If the folks who were destroying these documents were destroying
evidence, that is very serious and almost surely criminal behavior,"
said Randolph Beatty, dean of USC's Leventhal School of Accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has not described the types of documents destroyed but
accounting experts suspect they come under the broad category of what
the industry calls "work papers."</TE>
<TE>   "That could be everything from a memo discussing the facts around
an accounting issue and the rational for the firm's treatment of that
issue to ledger extracts and spreadsheets to memos that discuss what
invoices or other documents the auditor looked at," Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   News that the Andersen staff destroyed documents is only the
latest hit on the reputation of the firm, which was founded in 1913
as Andersen, DeLaney &amp; Co., and was more recently known as Arthur
Andersen. It was viewed among the nation's most prestigious
accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle an accounting fraud
lawsuit involving appliance maker Sunbeam Corp. last May. A month
later, the SEC fined the accounting firm $7 million to settle a
landmark fraud lawsuit over the firm's audits of Houston-based Waste
Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, it drew criticism for its treatment of off-balance
sheet partnerships and ventures at Enron and its eventual restatement
of the energy company's books that shaved $586 million off its
reported profit over four years.</TE>
<TE>   Board members--the individuals who decide which auditing firm to
recommend for the almost always perfunctory approval by
shareholders--say these troubles have hurt Andersen's reputation and
that it should expect trouble winning new clients and keeping old
ones.</TE>
<TE>   "As the head of a company or a member of an audit committee on a
board, I would not select Andersen right now," said Edward Muller,
former chief executive of Edison Mission Energy and a
board-of-directors member on the audit committee of GlobalSantaFe
Corp., a Houston oil drilling contractor.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they are innocent, there are five major accounting firms
out there. Andersen is going to be totally absorbed by the Enron
debacle for a long time, the others are not. Why pick the one with
all the troubles?" Muller asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say you have a problem at your company, why would you want
to put yourself in the position of explaining why you picked Andersen
now when you could chose one of the others?" Muller added.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen may have an easier time holding on to current audit
clients than gaining new ones, said David H. Batchelder, partner at
Relational Investors, a San Diego-based institutional investor that
specializes in distressed companies and turnaround situations.
Batchelder sits on three boards: Costa Mesa-based Apria Healthcare
Group Inc., Houston-based Nuevo Energy Co. and Boise, Idaho-based
Washington Group International.</TE>
<TE>   "For a firm using Andersen today, it will depend on a company's
confidence in the individuals who are doing an audit," Batchelder
said. "If you are on an audit committee reviewing firms for a new
assignment, Andersen would be a disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen declined to comment on the destruction of the documents,
citing pending investigations. A spokesman also declined to give much
detail on how its Enron problems were affecting its business.</TE>
<TE>   "Clients have obviously been concerned, but most have been
understanding. They recognize that unfortunate things happen to
companies," said David Tabolt, the firm's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   How long and how deep the company's slump might be isn't clear.
Both Batchelder and Beatty, the USC dean, believe the downturn for
Andersen could last a year or two, provided a new crisis doesn't
arrive.</TE>
<TE>   However, Turner, the former SEC official, believes Andersen could
go out of business especially if it is hit with large judgments in
the dozens of lawsuits it faces from Enron investors and pension
holders or large government fines.</TE>
<TE>   Turner said that Andersen's best hope may be that it is worth more
alive than dead. A viable company has a revenue stream that can pay
off damages. Attorneys attacking the accounting firm have a keen
understanding of that, Turner said, and will likely try to wrest the
largest settlement that still is within the ability to pay.</TE>
<TE>   One result could be that Andersen, the nation's fifth-largest
accounting firm, may be forced to merge with a larger sibling, Turner
said. Andersen had $3.6 billion in revenue from its U.S. operations
last year, less than half the $8.3 billion collected by the largest,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, according to the Public Accounting Report.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials say they expect to survive as an independent
company.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem looming for Andersen will be its ability to retain
and attract talent.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible "that young people who were considering Andersen as
a place to start their careers--the best and the brightest in their
field--don't go to Andersen," said Arthur Bowman, editor of the trade
newsletter Bowman's Accounting Report.</TE>
<TE>   Damage from the Enron-Andersen scandal could spread beyond the
accounting firm to the other members of the Big Five companies that
dominate the industry, and could ultimately lead to greater
government oversight, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "This points out how we need a new regulatory plan for the
accounting profession," Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman said that "the actions of the past few days are opening the
door for the government to become involved again in how the
profession polices itself," just as it did in the late-1970s after a
series of other accounting scandals.</TE>

<HD>UBS Wins Auction for Enron Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grasping for a crucial lifeline, Enron Corp. agreed to sell majority
ownership of its core energy trading business to UBS Warburg, a New
York investment banking firm, for an undisclosed amount.</LD>
<LD>   Enron, which would keep 49% of the wholesale trading business,
said the proposed sale is an important step in rebuilding the Houston
company so that it can successfully emerge from bankruptcy. But
analysts doubt that the trading operation of everything from
electricity to weather futures--a trading business Enron pioneered
and pushed to new heights--will ever return to its former glory.</LD>
<LD>   "There were really not any energy companies or traders bidding and
if there really was a viable entity that had a lot of value, you
would have seen some of them bidding," said utility analyst Andre
Meade of Commerzbank Securities.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not clear that this will ultimately be successful," Meade
said. "It's going to take a while to get counter-parties and trading
partners comfortable with a reconstituted Enron. A lot of them lost a
lot of money and had their businesses disrupted because of Enron.''</TE>
<TE>   Enron crumbled in less than seven weeks from a titan of the energy
industry to a resident of U.S. Bankruptcy Court, albeit the largest
ever. Revelations of hidden losses and suspect accounting practices
sent investors fleeing and brought on a cash crunch that ended in
Enron's Dec. 2 filing for bankruptcy-law protection.</TE>
<TE>   Enron conducted an auction Thursday among at least six bidders in
the New York offices of its bankruptcy attorneys, Weil, Gotshal &amp;
Manges, but was still working to seal the deal Friday morning and had
to request a two-hour delay before it could present the bidder to
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York. Enron said the agreement would be
filed Monday, and Gonzalez set a hearing for Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez also ruled late Friday that the Enron bankruptcy case
would remain in New York. Several creditors had sought to move the
case to Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "The consummation of this deal will literally bring back to life
the most valuable component of Enron's enterprise," Enron attorney
Martin Bienenstock said in court.</TE>
<TE>   Enron said the creditors committee in its bankruptcy case has
approved the selection of UBS Warburg, the U.S. arm of Swiss
financial services firm UBS, but some creditors sought to block or
delay the sale, saying they want more information about how the
proceeds of the sale will be used.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' estimates of how much the sale would bring have varied
widely, from as little as $100 million to as much as $1.5 billion.
Either would represent a tiny fraction of the former worth of the
trading business, which generated about 90% of Enron's nearly $101
billion in revenue in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Enron began as a traditional natural gas pipeline operator but in
recent years transformed itself into a little-regulated
wheeler-dealer in energy and dozens of other products, shedding
physical assets along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Since its filing, Enron has not run EnronOnline, its Web trading
operation, and has all but closed the rest of its trading operation,
which at its height early last year handled about  25% of the
nation's wholesale trading of energy.</TE>
<TE>   But many trading partners took their business elsewhere, and
without its information-controlling position, the value of Enron's
asset-light trading business is uncertain, Meade said.</TE>

<HD>Bridgestone Settles Firestone Tire Case</HD>
<DH>Litigation: The lawsuit would have brought the Tokyo-based
company to trial in the U.S. for the first time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAWRENCE VIELE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bridgestone Corp. has settled a lawsuit filed by a brain-injured
former nurse, avoiding what would have been the largest Japanese tire
maker's first U.S. trial involving injuries blamed on recalled
Firestone tires.</LD>
<LD>   Ford Motor Co. and Bridgestone's U.S. unit, Bridgestone/Firestone
Americas Holding Inc., also agreed to settle the suit, which was
scheduled for trial Monday in a Wheeling, W.Va., state court. The
amount of the settlement with former nurse Gloria Gregory was not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   "This settlement cost us much less than taking this case to
trial," said Firestone spokeswoman Jill Bratina. "This case was based
on speculation and very little fact. There were no tires to examine
and no evidence the tires were the cause of the accident."</LD>
<TE>   The case would have brought Tokyo-based Bridgestone to trial in
the U.S. for the first time. Bridgestone has sought to sidestep
liability in the Firestone tire litigation, claiming its U.S.
subsidiary was operated independently.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the settlement, the West Virginia Supreme Court
denied Bridgestone's appeal to be dismissed from the case on those
grounds, said Gregory's lawyer Cale Conley. Bratina said Firestone,
not its Japanese parent, will pay the tire maker's share of the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory claimed Firestone tires mounted on her Ford Explorer
sport-utility vehicle failed, causing the vehicle to flip. Gregory
was thrown from the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Ford officials called the claims "frivolous," saying Gregory
wasn't wearing a seat belt. Firestone said there was no proof of
defects because the tire that failed wasn't preserved.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and Nashville-based Firestone have settled hundreds of tire
tread failure and rollover claims since Firestone recalled 6.5
million tires made for the Explorer in August 2000 at the urging of
federal safety officials. Firestone recalled 3.5 million more tires
in October.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration links 271
deaths and more than 700 injuries to the tires, which were designed
and made for the Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Since the recall, sales of the Firestone tires and Explorer SUVs
have declined. The companies have traded blame for problems that have
caused the accidents.</TE>

<HD>Nonprofits Seek to Restore Funds</HD>
<DH>Services: Community groups CHARO and PACE say a job
training site certification process was inconsistent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council recommended Friday that the Workforce
Investment Board reconsider its decision to cut funding to two
long-standing community organizations that provide job training.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit groups--CHARO Community Development Corp. and
Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment--failed a rigorous
certification process implemented by the WIB to improve service and
consistency across the city-wide system.</LD>
<LD>   But four groups that failed the process allege it was
inconsistently applied and did not take their performance records
into account. Council members Friday expressed concern over those
issues and asked the WIB to reconsider its actions.</LD>
<TE>   "Both CHARO and PACE are community-based organizations of long
standing with records of excellence," Councilwoman Jan Perry said in
support of the motion. "I'm quite dismayed and greatly disturbed by
the outcome of this process."</TE>
<TE>   The motion was introduced by Councilman Nick Pacheco on behalf of
CHARO but amended Friday by Councilman Ed Reyes to include PACE,
which serves the Westlake district. Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski,
whose Westside district includes Casa de Hermandad--another
organization that failed the process--said she would review the
matter and consider a further amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve organizations that provide work force services under city
contract were certified under the process, which was based on a model
favored by the private sector. But CHARO, PACE, and Casa de Hermandad
were not. The decision, which the groups will appeal next week to a
board of city and WIB officials, means the organizations are no
longer eligible for at least $1.6 million each in annual city
funding.</TE>
<TE>   City and WIB officials stress that service will not be interrupted
to the tens of thousands of clients who use those centers, as other
organizations will be selected to take over.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Computing Institute--a satellite center that does not
have a full city contract but had hoped to win one--also failed. But
city officials said it can pursue a separate certification to
continue offering limited services.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focusing on numerical results--such as the number of
clients placed in jobs--the process selected by the WIB emphasizes
the restructuring of organizations to ensure continuous improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Do placement numbers say how long [the client] had to wait in the
lobby, or how many times they had to come back to the center, or
whether they were placed in a dead-end job?" WIB Executive Director
Michelle Douglas said in support of the standards.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's council action sets the stage for a debate between
elected officials and the city-appointed work force board, which
share equal power as the result of recent changes in federal law. The
WIB's executive committee must now decide whether to comply with the
council's request. If it opts not to, mediation could result.</TE>
<TE>   Under previous law, the council and mayor could overrule the
board. WIB members and private sector volunteers who spend countless
hours reviewing the applications opposed the council's effort to
intercede and say it is unfair to the dozen groups that passed.</TE>

<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. are set to co-lead a new
industrywide team in the multibillion-dollar U.S. drive to build
missile shields, industry officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   As co-heads of the national team being shaped by the Pentagon, the
two biggest military contractors would have key roles in meshing the
dozen or so existing missile defense programs.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago-based Boeing would take the lead in defining the
architecture of a planned multilayered shield that could involve
systems based on land, ships, in space and on modified Boeing 747
aircraft, industry executives said.</LD>
<TE>   Lockheed, of Bethesda, Md., would put the overlapping systems to
work through integrated battle-management and command-and-control
software.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush signed into law Thursday a $317.2-billion defense
funding bill that includes $8 billion for missile defense development
to meet what he has argued is the growing threat of ballistic missile
attack from North Korea, Iran, Iraq or other "rogue" states.</TE>
<TE>   Contract negotiations are underway, with an official announcement
expected in the next month.</TE>
<TE>   A Lockheed spokesman would not comment, and a Boeing spokeswoman
said the reorganization was still underway.</TE>

<HD>Greenspan Says Risks Remain</HD>
<DH>Economy: Fed chief warns that profits and investments are
weak. Rise in joblessness could hit consumer spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan poured cold water Friday on
optimistic business forecasts that the nation's economic recession is
all but over.</LD>
<LD>   Offering his first extended comments in almost three months,
Greenspan told a San Francisco audience the U.S. economy turned in a
"truly impressive" performance in weathering a stock bust, a
corporate investment downturn and the September terrorist attacks
without severe damage.</LD>
<LD>   But he cautioned against some analysts' and investors' sunny
predictions that the economy will snap back quickly, warning there
still are "significant risks" the recovery won't take hold.</LD>
<TE>   "I would emphasize that we continue to face significant risks in
the near term," Greenspan told the Bay Area Council. "Profits and
investment remain weak, and household spending is subject to
restraint."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Greenspan's remarks suggest the central bank will
cut its key, short-term interest rate still further when it meets
Jan. 29-30. Policymakers have slashed the so-called fed funds rate,
the interest banks charge each other for short-term loans, 11 times
in the last year to a four-decade low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Fed officials "are saying there is still a lot of uncertainty in
the system, so they'll probably go ahead and cut rates again," said
Stephen G. Cecchetti, a former New York Fed economist now at Ohio
State University in Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   If the Fed cuts rates further, it will not have to worry about
rekindling inflation. A new government report Friday showed that the
prices paid to American producers slipped 0.7% in December, the third
monthly decline in a row. For the year, inflation at the wholesale
level was the lowest it has been since 1986, according to the Labor
Department report.</TE>
<TE>   Investors greeted Greenspan's sober account of the economy's
condition by pushing down stock prices. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index fell 10.95 points, or 1%, to close at 1,145.60. The Dow Jones
industrial average slipped 80.33 points, or 0.8%, to 9,987.53. The
technology-filled Nasdaq composite index lost 24.76 points, or 1.2%,
to 2,022.48.</TE>
<TE>   The bond market took the comments as good news. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.86% on Friday from 4.97% on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan acknowledged there are "a number of encouraging signs"
of recovery, and traced some to the Fed's speedy slashing of rates.</TE>
<TE>   He said the nation's consumers have provided "a major stabilizing
force" by continuing to buy in the face of tumbling stocks and rising
layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   He said they were helped by a rate cut-induced mortgage
refinancing boom that boosted the cash value people were able to pull
from their homes, from a $20-billion-a-year rate in early 2000 to a
$75-billion rate last summer. He said they also were helped by auto
makers' interest-free financing offers during the fall, and by a
substantial decline in energy prices that helped boost households'
disposable income.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan also said businesses, aided by new high-tech information
systems, were able to reduce inventories quickly in line with slowing
demand. He said the trend is so advanced that firms soon must begin
restocking supplies, a move that should help stabilize the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "A slowing in the rate of inventory liquidation will induce a rise
in industrial production," he said. "That rise in production will
increase household income and spending," which would help spur
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But Greenspan suggested there are limits to each of the economy's
sources of strength. In the case of consumers, for example, he said
the mortgage refinancing boom largely has played itself out and that
the beneficial effects of lower energy prices may not be long-lasting
enough to keep up consumption.</TE>
<TE>   And he warned that unemployment probably will continue to rise for
some time to come and will "put something of a damper on consumer
spending."</TE>
<TE>   As if to illustrate Greenspan's point, Ford Motor Co. said Friday
that it will cut thousands of additional jobs, close five factories
and eliminate four automobile models in an effort to return to
profitability. The announcement was the latest in a string of
corporate layoffs that helped drive the nation's unemployment rate to
a near seven-year high of 5.8% last month.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said the nation's corporations suffer weaknesses similar
to those affecting households, and that these will contribute to slow
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   He cited widespread corporate over-investment in high-tech
equipment during the 1990s, followed by "fierce and unrelenting"
cutbacks during the last year.</TE>
<TE>   He said that globalization and deregulation have resulted in "a
virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business,"
leaving firms with shrunken profits and few options other than
layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed chairman repeated his oft-stated belief the economy still
has a long stretch of technology-driven growth ahead of it. But he
coupled his optimism with a warning that the economic toll of the
terror attacks is as yet largely untallied.</TE>
<TE>   "The tragic events of Sept. 11 have left obvious marks on the
economy that will not soon fade, even though some of the initial
impact of the shock has receded," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a change from last year's approach, Greenspan on Friday tiptoed
around the subject of tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that although tax cuts and spending increases might
help speed recovery, there is no pressing need for them because
already-approved measures probably would be enough.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan's indirect backing of President Bush's 10-year,
$1.35-trillion tax-cut package was crucial to its passage last year.</TE>
<TE>   He appeared to acknowledge Friday that the tax package is at least
partly responsible for the sudden reemergence of federal budget
deficits after years of surplus. He said the deficits are helping to
push up long-term interest rates, which could slow recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the firmness of long-term interest rates probably is the
consequence of the fall of projected budget surpluses and the implied
less-rapid pay down of Treasury debt," he said.</TE>

<HD>Mixed Reviews for TV, Film Tax Break</HD>
<DH>Hollywood: Governor predicts passage, but some legislators
say timing is not right given state's financial crunch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis told Hollywood labor leaders Friday he believes
legislators will pass his proposed tax credit aimed at stemming
runaway film and TV production, although Hollywood union officials
and state legislators acknowledged several obstacles remain.</LD>
<LD>   Chief among them will be convincing legislators outside Southern
California that the tax credits will benefit the entire state, not
just a Los Angeles industry, and that the economic boost will
outweigh lost tax revenues at a time when the state faces a severe
financial crunch.</LD>
<LD>   Although several Los Angeles lawmakers embraced the proposal
Friday, state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco),
was taken aback by it and said he will oppose it.</LD>
<TE>   "Things like this will be on the back burner until we see where we
are," Burton said. "At a time when the governor proposes to cut
[state aid] to poor people, it sort of leaves me speechless."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who
owns a production company, also is skeptical. Advocating an overhaul
of the tax system rather than granting specific industries tax
breaks, Peace said: "Don't pick an industry; do it across the board."</TE>
<TE>   But union officials, who have pushed for years for some kind of
state incentives to blunt the advantages of low-cost locations such
as Canada, said they believe the current statewide economic slump and
the entertainment industry slowdown will help overcome those
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "When times are good, it's a harder sell. But now you have people
who are unemployed," said Thomas Short, president of the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which
represents about 50,000 Los Angeles entertainment workers such as
grips, lighting technicians, cinematographers and costume designers.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's unions have pushed for years for state and federal
incentives to fight runaway production. Canada's weak dollar,
combined with government incentives, make shooting there about 25%
cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly one in four U.S.-developed productions shoot in foreign
countries, mostly Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Davis unveiled his proposal for a 15% wage-based tax credit for
the first $25,000 earned by workers on lower budget projects during a
meeting of entertainment union officers in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he has not had specific discussions about the proposal
with legislative leaders, but said this is the first time he has
joined the push for tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   "I am weighing in this time, fully in support of it this time. And
I believe that will make the difference," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' support of the tax credit comes as he faces reelection, and
is working to shore up support in the entertainment industry and
among unions that represent film workers, particularly given that one
of his Republican challengers, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan, has significant support within the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Though Hollywood unions believe the proposal is their best chance
yet of enacting an incentive, they said it may be hard given the
state budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   One union source at the meeting put the odds of enacting anything
this year at "50-50." Short predicted the proposal would win
statewide labor support, adding that Miguel Contreras, the powerful
head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, attended
Friday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal two years ago cleared the Assembly, but stalled in
the Senate and never got a push from Davis. That plan was broader,
prompting criticisms it could end up as a major giveaway for big
studios.</TE>
<TE>   The plan announced Friday would be narrower, and likely include
projects with budgets under $10 million such as TV movies, cable
shows and low-budget films. Those productions are the ones that flee
to cheaper locales most often.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, it is likely to have little, if any, effect on the
bottom line of today's giant entertainment companies.</TE>
<TE>   The likely cap on productions is less than 20% of the average
studio film budget.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the total amount of money producers are expected to save
statewide in the first year--$50 million--is less than the average
budget of a single Hollywood film, now at about $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, labor leaders consider Davis' support a major symbolic
victory because, they believe, it recognizes the severity of the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone hoped that you might see a leveling off. In fact, you've
seen an acceleration. This problem is not getting better, it's
getting worse," said Jay Roth, executive director of the Directors
Guild of America.</TE>

<HD>State's Job Losses Slow Markedly in December</HD>
<DH>Economy: Unemployment rate nudges down to 6%. No solid
rebound is expected soon, however.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON and STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's unemployment rate dipped to 6% last month and job losses
slowed significantly, signs that the state's hiring picture, while
still weak, may be stabilizing after several months of heavy losses.</LD>
<LD>   The decline in the jobless rate, from a revised 6.1% in November,
was due in part to the thousands of state residents who have stopped
looking for work and thus are no longer are counted in the
unemployment figures. California lost 600 jobs in December, capping
the worst year for the state's job market since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Still, economists said December's modest decline was an
encouraging sign after several months of heavy losses. In November
alone, the state lost 51,200 nonfarm payroll jobs. And it has shed
nearly 88,000 since September.</LD>
<TE>   "The job losses appear to be stabilizing," said Brad Williams,
senior economist with the California legislative analyst's office.
"But we've got some negative [factors] that have persisted and are
still with us."</TE>
<TE>   While the deepest losses may have tapered, Williams and others
said they are hard-pressed to identify any sectors of the state's
economy likely to post significant employment gains over the next few
months. Key sectors such as high technology and manufacturing
continue to lag, while government and some services are expanding
only slightly.</TE>
<TE>   "The state is still in recession," said Steven G. Cochrane, who
tracks the California economy as chief regional economist for West
Chester, Pa.-based Economy.com "There's no real job growth. The
technology economy still seems to be constricting. The service sector
is not expanding, and there'll be less and less help from government
spending as the state tries to reel in its budget deficit."</TE>
<TE>   December's losses come amid other signs of a weakened economy. For
example, the state reported that revenue from Californians'
withholding taxes in December fell 4.3% from the same month a year
earlier to $2.32 billion. Over the second half of the year,
withholding tax revenue was down 5.8% to $12.92 billion.</TE>
<TE>   As reported a week ago, the national economy lost 124,000 jobs in
December. While that boosted the nation's unemployment rate to an
almost seven-year high of 5.8%, the losses represented a slowdown
from the fierce pace of layoffs in the months immediately after the
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   California's latest numbers mirror that trend, with Southern
California continuing to be the bright spot on the state's employment
scene. Los Angeles County's jobless rate edged down to 6.1% in
December from a revised 6.2% in November. Orange County's
unemployment dropped to 3.2% on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, from
a revised 3.6% the month before. San Diego County showed a similar
drop to 3.3% in December from 3.6% in November.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment likewise dipped in some hard-hit Bay Area counties,
suggesting that the worst of the wrenching technology downturn may be
over. But economists said the latest jobs report shows that the
Southland, with its vast, diverse economy, continues to weather the
storm better than its northern neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "The southern part of the state is still quite strong," said Mark
Schniepp, director of the California Economic Forecast Project in
Santa Barbara. "It's one of the best places in the nation to be right
now in terms of strength of the economy."</TE>
<TE>   However, experts say Los Angeles County is proving to be the
region's weakest link. While the county's jobless rate inched down
last month, it is up sharply from the early part of the year, when it
fell to a low of 4.7% in February. Lisa Grobar, an economics
professor and director of the Cal State Long Beach Economic Forecast
Project, said the county's suffering manufacturing and export sectors
will continue to be a drag on employment.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are areas of real weakness," Grobar said. "L.A. County is
going to struggle in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the manufacturing sector, which tumbled into recession six
months before the rest of the economy, is still clawing its way out.
California's factory employment fell by another 3,600 jobs in
December, bringing total losses for 2001 to 92,700, a 4.7% decline.</TE>
<TE>   December likewise saw job losses in transportation and public
utilities, which declined by 4,000 jobs, while wholesale trade shed
2,800 jobs. Certain segments of the service industry also posted
losses. Those included hotels, which dropped another 2,500 jobs, and
business services, a catch-all category that covers everything from
computer professionals to temporary agency help.</TE>
<TE>   Sectors posting job gains included government, whose payrolls
increased by 4,200 workers. The construction trades added 2,600 jobs
and retailers added 1,800 positions.</TE>
<TE>   But economists don't see these sectors as huge drivers of job
growth. Declining tax revenue has put state, local and federal
governments in a budget bind. Retailers typically hire temporary
workers during the holiday rush.</TE>
<TE>   And analysts speculated December's boost in construction jobs was
largely due to dry weather and resumption of some work that was
slowed after Sept. 11. Construction employment for all of 2001 ended
down 1.7%, or 13,200, from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, building permits, normally a solid indicator of what
lies ahead in the construction business, are continuing to decline,
particularly for commercial and industrial projects.</TE>
<TE>   Construction "is in a downward mode," said Ben Bartolotto,
research director for the Burbank-based Construction Industry
Research Board, which tracks the industry in California.</TE>
<TE>   California ended 2001 with an overall decline of 38,100 jobs, the
biggest year-over-year loss in nonfarm payroll employment since the
recession of 1992. It's a stunning turnaround from 2000, when the
California economy added more than 554,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 job performance could look even worse next month, when
the state performs its annual major revision of employment
statistics, based on tax and unemployment insurance records from
employers.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary information suggests that the state's job total could
be about 90,000 lower than currently reported, a shortfall that
apparently reflects sharp job losses early in 2001 that didn't show
up in the initial employment reports. Those losses appear to have
been focused in business services, which could include dot-coms and
other firms hurt by the technology bust.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most economists predict that California's downturn, like
that of the nation, will be shallow and short, even though the jobs
picture may not improve until the second half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to fumble around for a few months" on the jobs front,
Schniepp said. "But the recession is going to be mild."</TE>
<TE>   Among California's 58 counties, the lowest unemployment rates were
2.7% in Marin, 2.9% in San Luis Obispo and 3.2% in Orange. The
counties with the highest jobless rates were Colusa at 25.5% and
Imperial at 18.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Among Latinos, joblessness rose to 7.1% from 7% the month before,
while it climbed to 5.1% from 4.9% among whites. Joblessness for
blacks remained unchanged at 8.5%.</TE>

<HD>Greenspan's Views Drag Down Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Economic worries weigh on investors. Dow closes
below 10,000 for the first time since Dec. 20.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks ended a discouraging week on a sour note Friday after a
downbeat speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and
several dismal corporate reports dimmed investors' hopes for a quick
economic turnaround. Bond yields fell on renewed hopes for another
interest rate cut by the Fed.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe the economic rebound isn't quite as strong as [investors]
thought," said Alan Day, an economist at Banknorth Investment
Management Group.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closed below 10,000 for
the first time since Dec. 20, falling 80.33 points, or 0.8%, to
9,987.53. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 24.78 points, or
1.2%, to 2,022.46. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was down
10.95 points, or 1%, to 1,145.60.</LD>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow was down 2.7%, Nasdaq fell 1.8%, and the S&amp;P
500 dropped 2.3%--breaking a three-week winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor, the world's second-largest auto maker, heightened
fears that rising unemployment will slam consumer spending when it
announced it will close five plants and slash 35,000 jobs. The auto
maker's stock rose 21 cents to $15.50 on hopes the moves will raise
profit.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart tumbled 90 cents, or 21%, to $3.30 and was the most active
issue on the NYSE. The company said it is in early talks with lenders
about existing and supplemental financing after reporting weak
holiday sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of once-mighty energy trader Enron, which closed at 67
cents on Thursday, never traded Friday after the NYSE halted trading
for pending news. UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, won the auction
for Enron's energy-trading unit. UBS rose 3 cents to $49.95.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan further darkened the mood on Wall Street when he said
the recession-racked economy shows signs of stabilizing, but still
faces significant risks, such as possibly higher unemployment and
falling consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   Economic data have been offering hints of improvement, but
corporate profits are still falling--by 22% in the fourth quarter
from the quarter before, according to research firm Thomson
Financial/ First Call--and investors worry that the recent rally has
made stocks too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings are not expected to turn positive until the second
quarter, First Call said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still premature to conclude that the forces restraining
economic activity here and abroad have abated enough to allow a
steady recovery to take hold," the Fed chief said to the Bay Area
Council Conference, a group of local corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   In other economic news, U.S. wholesale prices fell in December for
the third straight month, the government said in a report showing
inflation was contained as the sluggish global economy kept imported
energy prices down.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of inflation and the prospect of another Fed rate cut
were welcomed by bond traders. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note fell from 4.97% on Thursday to 4.86%--its lowest level
since Dec. 4. The six-month T-bill fell to 1.60% from 1.73% on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil services stocks continued their recent slide as crude prices
dipped below $20 a barrel for the first time this year. The
Philadelphia index of oil services companies fell 4%, with
Schlumberger off $1.13 to $51.42 and Noble Drilling down $1.52 to
$30.46. Oil fell 70 cents to $19.68 a barrel in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   * Cree dropped $7.05 to $23.60 after the maker of light-emitting
diodes, or LEDs, used in automotive and cell phone displays, missed
earnings expectations and gave a dim forecast for fiscal 2002 and
2003 growth.</TE>
<TE>   * IGEN International rallied $4.06 to $42.15. A Maryland jury
awarded it $505 million in total damages in its long-running legal
dispute with Swiss pharmaceuticals group Roche Holding over the
licensing of IGEN's blood-testing technology.</TE>

<HD>Judge Scraps Microsoft School Deal</HD>
<DH>Software: Court says $1-billion settlement wasn't enough
and might extend monopoly. More negotiations are possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp.'s $1-billion plan to settle more than 100 consumer
antitrust lawsuits was rejected Friday by a federal judge, who said
the software giant wasn't offering enough money.</LD>
<LD>   In a rare move, U.S. District Judge Frederick Motz refused to give
preliminary approval to the deal hammered out between Microsoft and a
consortium of class-action lawyers from several states.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of reimbursing customers for overpayments because of
Microsoft's ill-gotten monopoly, the deal would have given money,
software, computers and training to schools with poor students.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling leaves open the possibility of new negotiations among
all the parties because it suggests that more money and a greater
percentage of cash in the grants could do the job.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft deputy general counsel Tom Burt said the company was
disappointed by the ruling but has no plans to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not there will be further negotiations remains to be
seen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deal opponent Eugene Crew, the lead attorney in 20 California
class-action suits, said he was looking forward to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I invite them to give us a call, but we have an August trial
date," Crew said. "We want to go to trial and get in front of a
jury."</TE>
<TE>   Motz agreed that the school donation concept was a reasonable one,
given the administrative costs of distributing small refunds or
coupons to 100 million plaintiffs subject to various state laws.</TE>
<TE>   But he wrote that the education foundation Microsoft hoped to
establish would be "critically underfunded" and might unfairly extend
Microsoft's market dominance.</TE>
<TE>   Motz's other problems with the settlement included the wide range
of estimates of how much Microsoft's customers could hope to recover
at trial--from nothing to more than $40 billion.</TE>
<TE>   And he said that although the foundation would sponsor the
purchase of Apple Computer Inc. products as well as Microsoft's, the
prices involved, the nature of most refurbished machines for sale and
other factors probably would steer schools toward more Microsoft
gear.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to provide a means for flooding a part of the
kindergarten-through-high-school market, in which Microsoft has not
traditionally been the strongest player," Motz wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Apple and attorneys for California consumers were among those
fighting the settlement, and Motz's ruling came after renewed
discussions with Crew failed to make much headway. Some state
attorneys general, including California's, also objected.</TE>
<TE>   Crew said that a much bigger education-oriented settlement might
work, but that he had proposed a deal that would offer money to as
many as 13 million California consumers, who could then decide
whether they wanted to make donations.</TE>
<TE>   The class-action attorneys who had worked on the settlement
couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group, said
Microsoft will try again to settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on what California wants," he said. "With the judge
voicing his opinion, it's probably going to be a lot more money."</TE>
<TE>   Others agreed that it makes sense for Microsoft to keep at it, now
that Motz has validated the approach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly to Microsoft's advantage to try to work out a
settlement," said Gartner Group analyst Michael Silver. "Microsoft
would like to settle all of this stuff and get it out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's Burt said the company may try to follow Motz's
suggestions for improving the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft is always open to looking for reasonable ways to
resolve litigation," Burt said. "We will review the court's opinion
and at the same time move forward with the next steps in the
litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft investors, who had hoped the settlement would end one of
the company's thorniest legal problems, sent shares of the company
down 67 cents to $68.61 in Nasdaq trading Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is fighting nine states that broke with the
Justice Department and declined to join an antitrust settlement
between authorities and the company. The states are seeking harsher
penalties than the federal government, including a requirement that
the company offer versions of Windows without such add-ons as its
instant-messaging service and its music and video player.</TE>

<LD>DaimlerChrysler forced Deutsche Telekom, Europe's most indebted phone

billion in cash, two years earlier than planned.</LD>
<LD>   The auto maker, which has $16 billion of debt coming due this
year, sold 50.1% of Debis Systemhaus to Deutsche Telekom in March
2000, when technology stocks reached record highs. DaimlerChrysler
exercised an option to sell the rest of the unit Jan. 1 and the sale
will be completed by the beginning of March, the firms said.</LD>

<LD>Polaroid Corp. has withdrawn a controversial executive compensation

it's reworking the plan after criticism from retirees and workers.</LD>
<LD>   Polaroid had indicated it would revise the plan after a bankruptcy

during a December hearing. The original package could have provided
more than $5 million to top executives.</LD>
<LD>   Polaroid retirees and laid-off workers complained that the company

<LD>Federal regulators shut down Miami-based Hamilton Bank, a unit of
Hamilton Bancorp Inc., saying it failed to comply with enforcement
actions and saw its capital erode due to loan and operating losses.</LD>
<LD>   Hamilton Bank, with about $1.3 billion in assets and $1.2 billion
in deposits, specializes in financing trade deals among companies in
the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and South America.
It is the second-largest U.S. bank failure in 10 years, according to
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said Hamilton
concealed information from examiners concerning major assets. The OCC
first issued a safety and soundness notice about the bank in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Hamilton Bank, which also is under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, has a lawsuit pending against the OCC
charging that its bank examiners were prejudiced against Hispanics.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge refused to block President Bush's order preventing
mechanics of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines from going on strike.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge James Robertson's decision came after a
hearing requested by the mechanics' union about whether the White
House should have stepped into the dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Bush intervened last month at the request of federal mediators,
blocking a strike by the 15,000 United mechanics that he said would
have disrupted Christmas holiday travel.</LD>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers argued
that federal mediators did not meet a legal threshold in recommending
that Bush intervene. The union claims the overriding reason was to
avoid a strike during the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Frank Larkin did not know whether they would
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   UAL shares fell 78 cents to $14.33 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer resellers, who account for the bulk of sales for
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp., have swung behind the
controversial $25-billion merger between the companies, offering
support crucial for the success of such an alliance.</LD>
<LD>   These middlemen, collectively known as "the channel," cobble
together corporate computer systems from sophisticated technology and
offer expertise without the bias that customers expect from hardware
makers themselves.</LD>
<LD>   These value-added resellers, who also are known as consultants or
systems integrators, initially questioned the deal, which was
announced Sept. 4.</LD>
<TE>   But now some 70% to 75% are comfortable with it, said Bicky Singh,
chief executive of Future Computing Solutions, a reseller based in
Yorba Linda with annual sales of around $85 million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Conexant Systems Inc. said Chief Executive Dwight Decker and other
senior executives will not receive a salary increase unless the
company posts two consecutive profitable quarters.</LD>
<LD>   The communications-chip maker has reported losses since the
quarter ended September 2000. Decker's base salary declined to
$657,000 from $730,000 in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 after a 10%
decrease imposed on senior managers in March, the Newport Beach-based
company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   For the fiscal year, Decker earned a $686,827 salary, up 2.6% from
the previous year's $669,231, because the reduction took effect March
30. He received $26,118 in "other annual compensation" and $29,822 in
contributions to savings plans, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Decker also received 500,000 stock options with an exercise price
of $8.94 and 100,000 exercisable at $21.88. Conexant shares rose 6
cents to $14 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Volkswagen of America said it will recall 324,000 Golf, Jetta and New
Beetle models to repair a potentially faulty emissions system.</LD>
<LD>   The recall was instituted after the federal Environmental
Protection Agency cited VW for the emissions violations.</LD>
<LD>   Affected vehicles are from the 1999 through 2001 model years and
were built with 2-liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engines.</LD>
<TE>   The EPA said its tests of 1999 models showed that an oxygen sensor
malfunction caused elevated emissions. Sensors on the 2000 and 2001
models could have the same defect.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail and asked to
bring their cars to a nearby dealer for repairs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mission Viejo teenager accused of running a fraudulent investing
scheme relinquished almost $900,000 to federal authorities Friday.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a settlement with securities regulators, Cole A.
Bartiromo transferred the money from a Costa Rican casino to an
account controlled by the U.S. District Court in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The money is expected to remain under court control until the case
is resolved, at which point regulators typically ask the court to set
up a distribution plan to return the cash to aggrieved investors.</LD>
<TE>   A Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman confirmed the money
transfer, but declined to provide further details.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-year-old originally was supposed to wire the money by
Wednesday, but the transaction was delayed when the unnamed casino
required additional paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo is accused of masterminding an Internet fraud operation
that swindled more than $1 million from at least 1,000 investors
worldwide. Bartiromo had promised investors "guaranteed" profits that
he claimed to be making by betting on sporting events.</TE>
<TE>   In a preliminary settlement approved Monday, the court gave
Bartiromo 48 hours to repatriate the money from Costa Rica. It also
gave the youth 20 days to provide a complete accounting of his
operation, including details of any U.S. accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo's attorney could not be reached Friday for comment.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp. created a panel of former U.S. government
officials to advise Japan's largest auto maker as it seeks to promote
more women and minority managers and add minority-run dealerships in
the biggest auto market.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-member North American Diversity Advisory Board will be
chaired by Alexis Herman, Labor secretary in the Clinton
administration, Toyota Senior Vice President Doug West said.</LD>
<LD>   The panel will assess efforts to diversify top management, buy
more from minority-owned suppliers and increase minority-run
dealerships, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota, which ranks fourth in U.S. sales, announced in August a
10-year, $7.8-billion effort to increase minority-owned suppliers and
dealerships in North America.</TE>
<TE>   , The panel also includes Jack Kemp, former Republican
congressman; Federico Pena, Clinton administration Transportation and
Energy secretary; Susan Molinari, a former congresswoman from New
York; and Nathaniel Jones, a 6th Circuit Court of Appeals judge in
Cincinnati. Other members are Sara Martinez Tucker, president and
chief executive of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and Irene Hirano,
executive director of the Japanese-American National Museum in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's U.S. operations are based in Torrance. The company's
American depositary receipts rose $1.12 to $53.31 Friday on the New

<LD>UPN television President Dean Valentine is leaving the company
effective immediately, UPN parent Viacom Inc. announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The move at the top of the fifth-largest broadcast network--which
is experiencing a banner year--had been widely anticipated since
early September when Valentine filed suit against Viacom. Valentine
claimed the company had failed to pay him up to $22 million in
bonuses he was promised when he left his job as head of television at
Walt Disney Co. to run the fledgling network in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   In December, Viacom announced it would fold the management of UPN
under sister network CBS' chief executive, Leslie Moonves, in what it
called a cost-cutting move. But the consolidation was more
significant as a power play between Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone,
who wanted to keep UPN separate from CBS, and the company's chief
operating officer, Mel Karmazin, eager to put all of Viacom's network
operations under one management team. Paramount Television Group
Chairman Kerry McCluggage, who had been responsible for UPN, resigned
when the announcement was made.</LD>
<TE>   "I came here to be CEO of a network," Valentine said. "Once it is
merged with CBS, UPN no longer needs a CEO. It's not the job I was
hired to do."</TE>
<TE>   Viacom did not name a successor to Valentine, 47, saying Moonves
will oversee the operations of UPN until a new organizational
structure for the network is announced. Speaking to the Television
Critics Assn. in Pasadena on Thursday, Moonves said he has no
immediate strategies for making the 6-year-old network profitable.</TE>
<TE>   But the merger of the two network operations was not the reason
for Valentine's split from the network. Once he filed suit against
Viacom, Valentine's tenure was effectively over, according to UPN and
Viacom executives. The pending lawsuit is the subject of on-going
settlement talks.</TE>
<TE>   This season, UPN has increased its overall audience to 4.6 million
viewers, up 12%, largely because of the new Star Trek series,
"Enterprise," and the addition of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."</TE>
<TE>   "I am really proud UPN is being left in tremendously strong
financial and creative shape," said Valentine, who declined to
comment on the specific circumstances of his departure.</TE>
<TE>   UPN premiered Jan. 16, 1995, with programming only two nights a
week. It now airs shows five nights a week.</TE>

<HD>Morgan Stanley Charge Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A regulatory charge that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. failed to
adequately inform investors of the risks of bond funds it was selling
has been dismissed by a National Assn. of Securities Dealers hearing
panel.</LD>
<LD>   A disciplinary panel found that NASDR Inc., the regulatory
division of the NASD, took too long to bring fraud charges in
connection with the purchase by 100,000 investors of $2.1 billion in
closed-end bond funds in 1992 and 1993. The ruling, made in December,
was appealed by the NASD, said NASDR spokeswoman Nancy Condon.</LD>
<LD>   Investor lawsuits against Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., now part of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (ticker symbol: MWD), were dismissed by
federal and state courts in New York and New Jersey. A New York
federal court, in dismissing one suit, found the firm's prospectus
adequately disclosed risks. Morgan Stanley settled another investor
suit in California, and another is pending in Florida.</LD>
<TE>   "We're obviously pleased with the NASD ruling, which dismisses the
action based on the principle of fundamental fairness," said Morgan
Stanley spokesman Bret Gallaway. "A federal court and two state
courts and now the unanimous NASD hearing panel have ruled in our
favor."</TE>
<TE>   Condon, at the NASDR, said she couldn't comment on the ruling
because the case was on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The
funds at issue were TCW/DW Term Trust 2000, TCW/DW Term Trust 2002
and TCW/DW Term Trust 2003. The fund manager was TCW Group Inc., an
L.A.-based money-management firm that wasn't charged by the NASD.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the funds' derivatives, which typically are tied to
other financial benchmarks, was dependent on interest rates staying
low. When rates rose during 1994, about a quarter of all the funds'
original investors sold their shares at a loss, the NASD contended.</TE>
<TE>   Term Trust 2002 lost a third of its value in 1994, and about
30,000 investors sold shares during this period, realizing $65
million in losses, the NASD alleged. Since then, the funds, which
were sold at an initial price of $10 per share, have gained, Morgan
Stanley said.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Witter received more than $119 million in underwriting fees
and sales concessions as well as about $7 million a year in
management fees, the NASD complaint said. NASD Regulation said that
about half the investors were older than 60.</TE>

<LD>ON TWO WINGS</LD>
<LD>   Humble Faith and Common Sense at the American Founding</LD>
<LD>   By Michael Novak</LD>
<TE>   Encounter Books</TE>
<TE>   $23.95, 236 pages</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When students are introduced to the Founding Fathers, they learn
from the textbooks that men such as Jefferson, Franklin, Washington
and Adams worshiped at the altar of reason and eschewed religion. To
this day, students learn that one of the foundations of American
democracy and liberty is the separation of church and state. And to
this day, says Michael Novak in "On Two Wings," they learn the wrong
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "This picture of the United States," writes Novak, "is partly
correct, and, therefore, wrong in the most dangerous way--it is
partly wrong. What is truthful in it makes the rest seductive." Novak
acknowledges that the founders had a healthy respect for
Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke and Montesquieu, but he
contends that, contrary to popular belief, they had a healthier
respect for the Bible and for the God of Abraham and Moses.</TE>
<TE>   Novak is no stranger to controversial arguments. An impassioned
conservative thinker who has written steely defenses of the
corporation in American life and manifestoes about the link between
free-market capitalism and the examined life, he is affiliated with
the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think
tank.</TE>
<TE>   "On Two Wings" is billed as the perfect complement to David
McCullough's magisterial biography of John Adams and Joseph Ellis'
Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the founders. More of an extended
essay with ample footnotes and a long appendix offering sketches of
prominent Americans of the Revolutionary War era, Novak's book offers
an alternative to the secular myth of America's creation. And it is
indeed a myth.</TE>
<TE>   Novak is not the first to make the point that the generation that
led the Revolution and wrote the Constitution was closer in spirit to
the Massachusetts Pilgrims and Puritans than to the secular liberals
of the 20th century. From time to time, scholars have published
monographs that have excavated the rich legacy of biblical quotations
and sermons that were as much a part of the world of Jefferson,
Thomas Paine and James Madison as the treatises of Locke. But Novak,
by producing a voluminous set of quotations in this book-length pithy
essay, has certainly made it harder to overlook a fact that has been,
well, overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "The record shows," he concludes, "beyond a shadow of a doubt that
... the American founding ... drew its power from the Hebraic vision
of the Bible."</TE>
<TE>   The founders believed in God's infinite power and in human free
will, and they had a vision of liberty that placed individual free
will in the context of God's divine plan. Novak also shows that the
much-lauded separation of church and state stemmed from an opposition
to the official, state-sanctioned establishment of religion and not,
as many think, with any animus to religion as a powerful imperative
in local community life. The founders were hostile to religion
established by the federal government, not to state establishment of
religion. They concluded that when a strong central government is
placed in the position of enforcing religious morality, both morality
and that government suffer.</TE>
<TE>   The founders recognized that religious dissenters often channel
their animosity toward the central government, as they had during the
English Civil War of the 17th century, and religion can easily become
corrupt when too closely aligned with political power. They separated
the two for the good of both.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the most fiery of the revolutionaries, such as Paine and
Patrick Henry, eschewed religion in their adamant defense of liberty
and freedom. Paine wrote that "all the principles of science are of
divine origin," and that "religious duties consist in doing justice,
loving mercy and endeavoring to make our fellow creatures happy."
Henry, meanwhile, angrily defended himself against charges that he
was not a good Christian and retorted that "religion is of infinitely
higher importance than politics."</TE>
<TE>   Although Novak gives us a much needed corrective, he is also
guilty of overstating the case. Such is the danger of polemics, and
Novak flirts with replacing one unbalanced story with another. After
reading "On Two Wings," it would be easy to conclude that the
founders were devout Christians who saw the task of gaining
independence from Britain as a religious mission first and foremost.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is, of course, more muddled and ambiguous. The problem
is that no one in 18th century America or Europe understood
"religion" quite like it was thought of in the late 20th century. Nor
did they have a clear sense of "secular." Secular society, as we know
it, is a product of the mid-19th century. To claim, as Novak does,
that the religious dimension of the founding has been given short
shrift is both defensible and valuable, but to imply, as he seems to,
that the founders were men of religion as we understand religion
today risks replacing one myth with another.</TE>

<HD>Angeles Forest Sacred Site for Followers of Santeria</HD>
<DH>Rites: Animal sacrifices, rituals are held in the woods.
Religion blends Western, Central African deity worship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a patch of forest clustered around the 28-mile marker of Angeles
Crest Highway, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies Randy Rousseau
and Shane Maloney point to the dead chicken splayed out in the muddy
grass. Alongside the chicken lies a doll fashioned out of burlap and
purple ribbon. Up a little farther, red, black and white squares of
cloth are scattered on the ground.</LD>
<LD>   The deputies walk through a dry ravine, past a white votive candle
and what they figure is probably a goat's leg bone lying on the
ground. They climb up and over a rocky embankment, where Rousseau
sees a plastic bag behind a fallen tree and asks Maloney to get it.</LD>
<LD>   Rousseau guesses that there is torn clothing in the bag, and he's
right: Maloney returns with a white plastic grocery bag, which he
pierces with his baton. A shredded fluorescent green bra, orange
panties and a white T-shirt spill out at the deputies' feet.</LD>
<TE>   After countless forest patrols, deputies from the Crescenta Valley
sheriff's station learn that what may look like crime scenes are
often the ritual leftovers of Santeria, which blends Western and
Central African deity worship in religious ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Southland followers of Santeria have gone to Angeles
National Forest to complete their sacrifices and rituals--or at least
to dispose of the remains.</TE>
<TE>   "You come up here on a good day and there's goats and chickens
everywhere," Rousseau said. "It's unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Between 50,000 and 80,000 people regularly practice Santeria in
Southern California, according to experts. Unlike people in most
religions, who convene in houses of worship, Santeria followers often
carry out their rituals at home, in the back rooms of local botanicas
or in gardens and forests.</TE>
<TE>   They perform rituals in wooded areas because they are considered
sacred places where gods, or orishas, live, said Mary Ann Clark, an
adjunct professor at the University of Houston who has studied
Santeria since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Followers iron out the snags in their lives by performing rituals,
Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're sick, you want to get better. If you're unemployed, you
want to get a job. If your love life isn't going well, you want to
fix that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Santeria worshipers sacrifice animals--only those raised to be
eaten--to ask the orishas for help. Followers rip their own clothes
off, bathe and dispose of the garments to cleanse themselves of
negative energy.</TE>
<TE>   Ysamur Flores Pena, a Santeria priest who teaches about the
religion at UCLA, said the rituals are especially powerful when
carried out in the forest because followers believe that the natural
world can cure anything from a disease to a broken heart. Even plant
life is considered conscious, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the rituals carried out in Angeles National Forest may not be
the work of Santeria initiates at all, Flores Pena said. They could
be performed by people whose familiarity with the religion is limited
to reading a book on exorcisms or spells, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santeria "is very popular and hip now," he said. "People are
buying how-to books like crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Genuine Santeria rituals should be performed by trained priests or
priestesses, he said. He dismissed descriptions of the litter in
Angeles Forest as the sloppy work of a novice. Anyone who is trained
knows not to pollute the forest and disrespect the very gods and
forces they were seeking to appease, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Flores Pena said, when the untrained carry out makeshift
rituals, they might not get what they're asking for.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like if you like to cook, you follow the recipe," he said.
"If you don't do it correctly, you won't get what you intended."</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Lint Sagarena, a USC professor of religion, American
studies and ethnicity, was reluctant to dismiss the deputies'
findings as the work of simple copycats.</TE>
<TE>   "These people in the woods are practicing some form of Santeria,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' Santeria community is the third largest in the United
States, behind New York and Miami. The L.A. community is primarily
Latino, while the other two cities combine West Indian and Latino
influences. It's difficult to determine the number of Santeria
followers in the United States, however, because so many fear that
publicizing their faith will lead to persecution.</TE>
<TE>   "The religion has been marginalized, so people won't admit to it,"
Clark said. "I know people that have lost their jobs because people
knew they were doing this. In New York and Miami ... there are people
whose houses have been raided. They find chickens and drag [the
residents] off to jail."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a Florida city law aimed
at Santeria followers that would have prohibited the "possession,
slaughter or sacrifice" of an animal if it was killed in "any type of
ritual."</TE>
<TE>   In California, individuals can face criminal prosecution under
certain circumstances surrounding an animal's death, said Lt. Wallace
Fullerton of the Crescenta Valley sheriff's station. If the animal
belonged to someone else or if someone else witnessed the animal's
killing, the district attorney could press charges. Unlawful damage
to people, animals or plant life can be cited by the U.S. Forest
Service.</TE>
<TE>   But such considerations are low on law enforcement's priority
list. "Finding chicken bones is not something we'll put a lot of
resources and time into," Fullerton said.</TE>

<LD>A national Jewish college organization has published a new version of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech as
it might appear as a sacred Jewish text.</LD>
<LD>   Hillel, a network of more than 500 Jewish campus centers,
published the speech to coincide with King's annual birthday
celebration, to be observed this year on Jan. 21. The document grew
out of a public policy conference in Washington last year, when
participants visited the Lincoln Memorial, where King delivered the
1963 speech.</LD>
<LD>   The speech appears as it would in the Talmud, the collection of
ancient Rabbinic laws, commentaries and traditions related to the

<LD>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Focus on the Family, the evangelical
Christian media ministry based here, has scaled back its 25th
anniversary celebration this summer because of the faltering economy,
Sept. 11 fallout and other logistical barriers, organizers said.</LD>
<LD>   The organization wanted to stage a massive, three-day public event
at the U.S. Air Force Academy football stadium not far from the
ministry's headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   But problems arose even before the terrorist attacks, including
worries about transportation, parking and weather, said Steve
Johnson, manager of the celebration. Since then, tighter security and
the threat that the academy might be closed if another terrorist
strike were to take place convinced the group to look elsewhere, he
said.</LD>

payment, ending a $23-million campaign to help integrate the church.</LD>
<LD>   The fund was initiated in anticipation of a merger with the
Evangelical United Brethren Church, which occurred in 1968, forming
the United Methodist Church. The fund was designed to help compensate
pastors who were members of two segregated conferences.</LD>

<HD>Lottery Lawsuit to Be Dismissed; Appeal Is Planned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sacramento judge said Friday that he planned to dismiss a lawsuit
that exposed the California Lottery's sales of tickets after the top
prizes were dispensed.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ronald Robie said at a hearing that while he wasn't
condoning what the lottery had done, a state law requiring the agency
to abide by rules on truthful advertising wasn't specific enough to
be enforceable. Only under special circumstances can the government
be sued for violating laws that businesses and individuals have to
follow.</LD>
<LD>   "When the government is allowed to be sued, it must be because
they have a mandatory duty to perform in a certain way, and that duty
must be very clearly articulated in the law. That is not the case
here," said Nathan Barankin, spokesman for the California attorney
general's office, which is defending the lottery.</LD>
<TE>   After explaining his tentative ruling, Robie listened to an hour
of arguments against it by an attorney for San Francisco teacher Amy
Stanley, who accused the lottery of selling her tickets for
"Scratchers" instant games when she had no chance of winning the
advertised top prizes of as much as $100,000. Robie said he will
issue his final ruling soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I am gratified with the court's tentative ruling," said Lottery
Commission Chairman David Rosenberg. "I want to personally assure the
public that we are taking our responsibility seriously to operate the
lottery fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley's attorney, Kevin Roddy, said he plans to appeal if Robie
makes the tentative ruling final.</TE>
<TE>   Roddy said he intends to file a new lawsuit against convenience
stores and other retailers as well, because they profited by selling
tickets with no chance at the top prizes. "This is just Chapter 1,"
Roddy said. "There are other people involved in this. Retailers don't
have immunity."</TE>
<TE>   While the litigation may be crippled by the government's immunity,
the suit has had an effect already.</TE>
<TE>   About eight months after it was filed, the lottery admitted in
court papers that in 11 of the more than 100 Scratchers games in the
last five years, tickets were sold after the last big prize had been
claimed.</TE>
<TE>   In later statements to The Times, officials said that in one game,
ticket sales extended for three years after that point.</TE>
<TE>   The lottery changed its procedures last summer and now notifies
retailers electronically when the big prizes are gone, asking them to
stop the sales.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the lottery apologized for the late sales and said it
planned to offer a "makeup" drawing with $1 million in prizes for all
previous Scratchers players.</TE>
<TE>   That figure is far less than the amount of hopeless tickets, as
much as $6.6-million worth, that might have been sold in the last
five of the 15 years of Scratchers games.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, agency spokesman Vincent Montane said the lottery does
not plan to require that old Scratchers tickets be sent in for the
consolation drawing scheduled for next month. Drawing details will be
released soon, he said.</TE>

<HD>Pepper Spray Use Restricted</HD>
<DH>Courts: Police overreacted against nonviolent protesters,
judges say. Case involved environmentalists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the third time in two years, a federal appeals court in San
Francisco has issued a decision limiting the circumstances in which
police can use pepper spray to subdue nonviolent protesters.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, in a case growing out of rallies against logging of
old-growth redwood trees in the Headwaters Forest area, the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the use of pepper spray against
environmental activists by Humboldt County officers constituted
excessive force.</LD>
<LD>   The court held 3-0 that the officers' conduct was unreasonable,
even when viewed through the prism of a U.S. Supreme Court decision
last year that afforded police more protection from civil lawsuits.</LD>
<TE>   Consequently, the 9th Circuit said Friday that nine protesters are
entitled to return to federal district court in San Francisco and go
to trial to seek damages against the county sheriff and his chief
deputy.</TE>
<TE>   The case concerns the conduct of law enforcement officers during a
series of protests in the fall of 1997. Sheriff's deputies used
cotton swabs to dab pepper spray into the eyes of several
demonstrators who were staging peaceable protests to prevent Pacific
Lumber Co. from cutting the huge redwoods. Additionally, some
officers sprayed the caustic chemical directly into the eyes of
protesters, despite the fact that manufacturers' labels on the
containers of spray expressly discouraged using the spray from less
than three feet away.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters sued, contending that the officers violated their
4th Amendment right to be free from excessive force. The law
enforcement officers countered that they were entitled to qualified
immunity, and a federal district judge in San Francisco dismissed the
case.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, the 9th Circuit reversed that decision, saying the
officers were not entitled to immunity from lawsuits. "The evidence
suggests the protesters suffered excruciating pain" from the use of
the pepper spray, the court said. And because the protesters posed no
danger to anyone at the time, a jury should decide if the amount of
force was unreasonable under the circumstances, the court added.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, in a case called Saucier vs. Katz and stemming from an
animal rights protest, the U.S. Supreme Court gave police officers
added protection in suits alleging excessive force. The high court
ruled 6-3 that a suit alleging excessive force must be dismissed even
if the officer's behavior was unreasonable, so long as a reasonable
officer might have made the same mistake under the circumstances in
question.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court then vacated the 9th Circuit decision in the
Headwaters case and sent it back to the 9th Circuit for reevaluation
in light of the Saucier decision.</TE>
<TE>   Under the qualified immunity doctrine asserted by the Humboldt
officers, "government officials ... generally are shielded from
liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate
clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a
reasonable person would have known," according to an earlier Supreme
Court decision.</TE>
<TE>   The Saucier decision directs lower federal courts to analyze
claims of qualified immunity by answering two questions. First, the
lower court must determine whether "in the light most favorable to
the party asserting the injury ... the facts alleged show the
officer's conduct violated a constitutional right."</TE>
<TE>   If the plaintiffs clear that hurdle, then the court must ask
whether the right at issue was "clearly established in light of the
specific context of the case" so that it would be clear to a
reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing the facts in the most favorable light to the protesters,
"a rational juror could conclude that the use of pepper spray against
the protesters constituted excessive force and [the officers] were
liable for the protesters' unconstitutional injury," 9th Circuit
Judge Harry Pregerson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   On the second point, "it would be clear to a reasonable officer
that using pepper spray against the protesters was excessive under
the circumstances," Pregerson continued.</TE>
<TE>   Judges William A. Fletcher and Myron H. Bright joined in the
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The judges also stressed that the protesters' tactic of linking
arms through 10- to 25-pound steel tubes called "black bears," which
prevent officers from applying pressure to separate them, did not
constitute "active resistance to arrest."</TE>
<TE>   The judges also said that it was "clearly excessive" under the
circumstances for the officers to spray the demonstrators and then
wait 20 minutes before washing out the protesters' eyes with water.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was applauded by Mark Hughes, a University of Denver
law professor who represented the plaintiffs. "Now we know that under
any standard the police acted unreasonably and illegally."</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer representing the officers was unavailable for comment
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Crosby of the ACLU of Northern California, which filed a
brief on behalf of the plaintiffs, praised the court for "refusing to
exonerate law enforcement officers who deliberately hurt peaceful
protesters by using pepper spray as a kind of chemical cattle prod."</TE>

<HD>Padres Get Help From Bench in Ballpark Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Spring training is more than a month away, but sports litigation--a
year-round activity here--was in midseason form Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Kevin Enright sided with the City Council and
the owners of the San Diego Padres baseball team against a retired
University of San Diego law professor who has sued to block the city
from selling $170 million worth of bonds to help build a downtown
ballpark for the team.</LD>
<LD>   Enright ruled that he, not a jury, will decide the issues brought
up in the lawsuit filed by Bob Simmons. A hearing was set for Jan.
28.</LD>
<TE>   Simmons had sought a jury trial, but the city and the Padres
argued that because it would take months to schedule such a
proceeding, a jury trial would further delay construction of the
ballpark. The project is already two years behind schedule because of
a series of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "With your ruling, we have cast due process aside for the
financial convenience of the city of San Diego," said Simmons'
attorney, Stanley Zubel.</TE>
<TE>   Enright said he was influenced, in part, by a statement from the
Padre organization that the cost of the park is increasing $1 million
a month while construction remains halted. The project was shut down
14 months ago when the city declined to advance additional funds to
the Padres until the bonds were sold.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Devaney, executive assistant to City Atty. Casey Gwinn,
said city officials "look forward to having the case thrown out" Jan.
28. "This is being pushed to the limit of everyone's patience," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials and Padre management had thought the project was
back on track after the council voted 8 to 1 on Nov. 20 to sell the
bonds. That optimism was premature.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons sued soon after the vote, saying details of the
public-private partnership were different enough from a 1998 ballot
measure endorsed by 60% of the voters that a second public ballot
should be required.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with yet more litigation, the city benched its plan to sell
the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen other lawsuits--including eight involving former council
member turned full-time gadfly Bruce Henderson--had delayed the
city's plan to sell the bonds to finance its 70% share of the
project, which includes a 42,500-seat ballpark and surrounding
commercial development. The city and the Padres prevailed in all 14
lawsuits, but two are on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres, in the legal equivalent of a brushback pitch, have
sued to block Henderson from being able to file any additional suits.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres' suit asks a judge to rule that Henderson has abused
the legal process by becoming a "serial litigator."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Have Praise for Team That Buried Them</HD>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>This is the type of night that makes you want to go home and crawl in
your bed. Except the Lakers didn't have that option Friday. They
boarded a bus and went to the airport, where a plane was waiting to
take them to Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   And so it goes on. It was as if life on the road, the four flights
and six hotel nights and 3,500 miles, caught up to them Friday. And
then the Minnesota Timberwolves ran away from them.</LD>
<LD>   It's pretty rare to see the Lakers scored on at will and taken out
of their offense in the same game, but the Timberwolves did it to
them to win, 120-102. And they did it, as they have for their entire
seven-game winning streak, without injured starters Joe Smith and
Terrell Brandon.</LD>
<TE>   It was Day 7 on the road for the Lakers. It was Kobe Bryant coming
down an open lane and instead of throwing the ball down over his head
with a one-handed dunk, barely getting over the rim for a two-hand
slam. It was Devean George missing a three-pointer that could have
given the Lakers the lead for the first time all night--and the
Lakers never getting such a good opportunity again.</TE>
<TE>   It was shots and runs and comebacks coming up a little ... bit ...
short.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you have a long road trip like this, it wears you down
a little bit," Bryant said. "You play through it. Then again, it's
encouraging to know that in the playoffs you don't have to do this
type of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   There was a sense that none of this mattered too much to the
Lakers. They've been around enough to know these things happen,
especially far from home. The only other team with a road record as
good as the Lakers' 10-5, San Antonio, lost to the increasingly
dysfunctional 76ers in Philadelphia on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson limited Thursday activities to a workout because he
thought the group needed a break, and that might have hurt as well.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they gave the Timberwolves love the way they rarely do for
another team. They bracketed just about every comment they made with
praise for the Timberwolves. You don't hear Jackson go into the
typical coaches' "you-have-to-give-them-credit" routine, but he did
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the Timberwolves made just about all of the
opponents' top marks for the season obsolete Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Wally Szczerbiak even got the better of his matchup with Bryant,
dropping 34 points to Kobe's 23 (on nine-for-27 shooting), and
putting up a strong case for the locals who think he should make the
all-star team.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just a better basketball player than I thought he was,"
Bryant said. "Next time we play him, I can't stray from him as much."</TE>
<TE>   All of this praise is because the Lakers still feel so confident.</TE>
<TE>   But they'll only go so far.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, who rarely gives a foe anything more than
cursory praise, was asked if he was impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Nooooo," O'Neal said. "Anybody can win one game."</TE>
<TE>   Some Minnesota radio guy tried to turn this into a Major Respect
Issue, asking Kevin Garnett what he thought of O'Neal's comment that
he wasn't impressed. Garnett gave it about all the attention it
deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where that came from," he said. "Who cares? Next
question."</TE>
<TE>   As Garnett said later, the Lakers shouldn't be impressed by
anybody. They're the champions. He said he'd do the same thing if the
Timberwolves ran things.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett did what Shaq usually does. He controlled the middle on
defense (including three blocked shots) and was their go-to guy on
offense, producing 32 points.</TE>
<TE>   This game meant so much more to the Timberwolves. This is a
franchise that has never been past the first round of the playoffs
but now looks ready to be heard from come May. He made sure Bryant
heard him in the fourth quarter, when he blocked a frivolous dunk
attempt by Bryant after a whistle had already blown the play dead,
then he talked to him about it.</TE>
<TE>   He's trying to act like the big dog for his team, because as he
said: "You can't fight a pit bull with a chihuahua."</TE>
<TE>   The Timberwolves are starting to look like a miniature version of
the Lakers. They rely on two stars, Garnett and Szczerbiak, who
feuded in the past but now get along great. They even have one of
Jackson's favorite quotes, a passage by Rudyard Kipling that reads
"For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the
wolf is the pack", hanging in their locker room.</TE>
<TE>   They took a little step Friday. The Lakers think in terms of
journeys.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, interpreting O'Neal's perceived slight of the
Timberwolves, said: "What he means by that is, you win in the
playoffs. Even though they played out of their minds and their fans
were excited by this win--and they should be--the chips are on the
line when the playoffs come along. But they played great. Our hats
have to go off to them."</TE>
<TE>   Temporarily. O'Neal's cap was on, backward, when he walked out.
And Bryant was already looking ahead to the next time the Lakers come
here, in February. In the NBA, sometimes it seems as if you're always
looking down the road.</TE>

<HD>Struggling Raiders Seek an About-Face</HD>
<DH>NFL: Team that was 10-3 is on a three-game losing streak
entering wild-card game against the New York Jets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than three decades, any television director working any
Raider game, either Oakland or Los Angeles variety, knew his
priorities: Zero in on the line of scrimmage. Focus on the
quarterback. Find Al Davis.</LD>
<LD>   In good times and bad, the Raider owner, usually seated in the
press box, could be counted on to mirror the team's fortunes on his
face.</LD>
<LD>   In recent seasons, the camera has found a new favorite face, Coach
Jon Gruden's. His emotional highs and lows entertain millions.</LD>
<TE>   And more recently, yet another face has come to symbolize Raider
fortunes, fullback Jon Ritchie's. Because of a cut that won't heal on
the bridge of his nose and small nodules on his forehead--"Those are
horns growing out of my head," he says--Ritchie's face grows bloodier
as the game progresses.</TE>
<TE>   And what better picture could the camera find these days to tell
the Raider story?</TE>
<TE>   Heading into today's wild-card playoff game at Oakland's Network
Associates Coliseum against the New York Jets, the same team that
beat them there in last weekend's regular-season finale, the Raiders
are a team in search of a way to stop the bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   Was it really only a month ago that the Raiders were handing out
the punishment? Surrounded by silver-and-black loyalists who had
packed San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, the Raiders beat the Chargers
and won the AFC West title. That boosted Oakland to 10-3 and last
season's elimination in the AFC championship game by the Baltimore
Ravens was only a memory.</TE>
<TE>   But since, history appears to be repeating itself. The Raiders
lost three in succession and three of their last four at home, after
having won 10 straight in Oakland, and questions have arisen:</TE>
<TE>   * Can the Raiders run the ball effectively?</TE>
<TE>   Oakland ranks 24th in rushing offense, so this has been a
questionable area all season. But it's even more questionable now
because a foot injury has cost leading rusher Charlie Garner practice
time. Limited playing time by Garner would be a double liability for
the Raiders because he is also an effective receiver, having caught
72 passes. If Garner can't carry a full load, Oakland will have to
fall back on Tyrone Wheatley, who has had a so-so season.</TE>
<TE>   * Does Sebastian Janikowski have his act together?</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders' wild and crazy kicker would have fit in perfectly
with "the Snake" (Ken Stabler), "the Tooz" (John Matuszak), "the Mad
Stork" (Ted Hendricks) and some of the other characters who have worn
the silver and black. But on game day, those guys produced.</TE>
<TE>   Janikowski sat out last week's game because, the Raiders said, of
cellulitis in his foot. No one is saying that wasn't really the
problem, but any guy who has been involved in bar fights, drug busts
and allegations of bribery of a police officer is going to have to
expect some raised eyebrows when he doesn't suit up.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland certainly needs him. Last week's replacement kicker, Brad
Daluiso, missed an extra-point attempt and a 28-yard field-goal try
in the 24-22 loss to the Jets.</TE>
<TE>   * Do the Raiders lack discipline?</TE>
<TE>   Their quarterback, Rich Gannon, said they did after a recent loss.
His remarks were not well received by some teammates and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says things when you lose," Oakland tight end Roland
Williams said. "You get pretty emotional after a loss and that is
probably not the best time to say things."</TE>
<TE>   The Jets, 10-6 as are the Raiders, can draw little solace from the
problems in Raiderland. They have their own:</TE>
<TE>   * Beating a team twice in a week is tough. Beating a team twice in
a week on its own turf is, well, the word "improbable" may not be
strong enough.</TE>
<TE>   * And beating that team after having spent nearly as much time
traveling as practicing during the intervening week? We shall see.</TE>
<TE>   With only six days separating Sunday's New York victory from
today's game, the Jets, in hindsight, would have been smarter to stay
on the West Coast. But it wasn't until the Baltimore Ravens had
beaten the Minnesota Vikings in the Monday night game that the Jets
knew they would have a return match in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   And they weren't willing to gamble on it. Instead, they took a
red-eye flight back to New York, arriving in the wee hours of Monday
morning, took Monday off, practiced Tuesday and Wednesday, practiced
early Thursday and then took a charter back to Oakland. With a 5p.m.
start, expect the weary Jets to be sleeping in today.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets insist their focus hasn't wavered. They just keep looking
at the prominently displayed trophy from New York's victory in Super
Bowl III.</TE>
<TE>   "You see that trophy 15 times a day," running back Curtis Martin
said. "It's a reminder of what we're after."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders have had their own reminder this week: Sunday's game
film.</TE>
<TE>   "We have left ourselves a lot of room for improvement," Ritchie
said. "We are laying in wait in the bushes, waiting to spring out and
surprise some folks because we have performed at a subpar level. That
leaves you with a lot of residual anger."</TE>
<TE>   And one more shot at the Jets.</TE>
<TE>   "We have another at-bat," Gruden said.</TE>
<TE>   But the struggling Raiders are down to their last strike.</TE>

<LD>Charles Barkley is popping off--again--in an interview in the
February issue of Stuff magazine: "You can't consider talking about
sports as a real job. Sitting around talking about sports is the
best. I hate regular people voicing their opinions about sports
because they're just fans--they don't know anything."</LD>
<LD>   Then, he added: "I don't need this gig. I'm rich. The job barely
covers my expenses in Vegas. I don't need to be on TV. If I had a
good agent, I'd be on 'Temptation Island.'"</LD>
<LD>   Note to Charles: Find a good agent.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which was the first NFL wild-card team to win the
Super Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frozen redundancy: Writers often refer to tundra as frozen,
borrowing the phrase from the late John Facenda's narration on old
NFL films. Gene Collier of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette had this
comment: "There's no other tundra than frozen, folks. It's like
saying the 'liquid ocean.'"</TE>
<TE>   Besides tracking such redundancies, Collier annually rails against
sports cliches, especially the convoluted ones like this from the
Steelers' Jerome Bettis: "We see the light at the end of the
rainbow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ram bandwagon: Both John Madden and Marv Levy think the NFL has
benefited from having the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the dominant team thing," Madden said. "Parity
equals mediocrity equals boring."</TE>
<TE>   Said Levy: "Having a dominant team is healthy. Love them or hate
them, like the Yankees. It raises passion. Nobody can beat the
Rams--except the Rams."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lovable Cubbies: Brian McRae to the San Francisco Chronicle about
his three seasons as a Cub: "Chicago is the best place to play if an
athlete doesn't care about winning or losing. You don't have to win
to be revered in Chicago, especially if you're a Cub.</TE>
<TE>   "In New York, you've got the garbage man yelling at you if you
didn't get a hit last night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The real chair-man: From comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "John
McEnroe will be the host of the new TV quiz show 'The Chair.' Hey, if
you were going to pull someone from the world of sports to host a
show called 'The Chair,' shouldn't it really be Bobby Knight?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thankless job: Noting that new Florida Coach Ron Zook was the
defensive coordinator of the New Orleans Saints, Greg Cote of the
Miami Herald said that's "sort of like being the publicity director
for the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1969, the New York Jets upset the
Baltimore Colts, 16-7, in Super Bowl III in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Joe Namath had "guaranteed" a victory for the Jets on
the Thursday before the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Oakland Raiders, who defeated the Philadelphia
Eagles, 27-10, in New Orleans in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Shortly after helping Miami win the national
championship, junior running back Clinton Portis announced he will
make himself eligible for the NFL draft, saying, "There isn't much
more I can do in college."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ken Rudulph of Fox's "Best Damn Sports Show Period":
"Apparently Portis has never heard the word 'graduate.'"</TE>

<HD>L.A. Thrown by the 'Wolves</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Behind Garnett and Szczerbiak, Minnesota
easily wins battle of streakers, 120-102.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Meanwhile, back in the Western Conference, the Lakers played another
meaningless fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Only this time, it was they who finally, exhaustively, gave up
hope, they who stood without expression before the hysterical crowd,
and they who tried to shield themselves from the harm of the joyous
chest-bumps and high-fives.</LD>
<LD>   After four consecutive routs and six consecutive wins, the Lakers
turned the muzzle on themselves Friday night, played uncaring defense
and spit up crooked jumpers. Only too willing to accept, the
Minnesota Timberwolves were 120-102 winners at Target Center, where
Wally Szczerbiak scored 34 points and Kevin Garnett had 32, including
16 in a row for the Timberwolves in a 5:15 span of the first half.</LD>
<TE>   The Timberwolves made more than half of their field-goal attempts,
their first 30 free throws and had Laker-like leads of 15 points in
the third quarter and 19 in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The five-game trip concludes tonight in Chicago. The outcome there
will decide their feelings about the eight-day journey through the
Midwest, where they won the unofficial Central Division crown but
were waxed good in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant visited briefly with his former, reckless self,
missing 18 of 29 attempts. He had 23 points and Shaquille O'Neal had
29, but the Lakers made 39.8% of their shots and were beaten by 14 on
the boards. Bryant smiled and said, "Four-and-one ain't bad."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming Chicago, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Between here and there, they'll have a lot of awful to chew on.
Such as, their worst loss so far this season, the most points given
up in 13 months, and the highest field-goal percentage given up
(53.2) this season.</TE>
<TE>   A jacked-up crowd that in the same winter lost a football coach
and maybe a baseball team chanted "Wal-LEE!" for the brooding
Szczerbiak and "MVP!" for the passionate Garnett. The Timberwolves
(26-9) won their seventh consecutive game, all without starters Joe
Smith and Terrell Brandon, and moved past San Antonio for first place
in the Midwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   "They were quick, they beat us to loose balls, they moved the ball
well and they hit their shots," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "That
was as good a game as we've had played against us this year."</TE>
<TE>   Garnett had 15 points in the second quarter and 23 at halftime.
Szczerbiak had 20 points in the second half. Jackson ran handfuls of
power forwards at Garnett, and Bryant, primarily, at Szczerbiak, and
could not get the defensive stops to make a fourth-quarter run. The
Lakers were within 91-86 with nearly 10 minutes left. Three minutes
and eight Szczerbiak points later they were down 15, and done.</TE>
<TE>   "That was all them tonight," Laker forward Robert Horry said.
"They just straight gave us an old-fashioned one."</TE>
<TE>   Typically this season Bryant has set up his teammates before
wresting away the offense in the second half, a habit that has won
him praise from Jackson and friendship from O'Neal. He was more
aggressive early against the Timberwolves, however, causing Jackson
to believe Bryant was caught up in Szczerbiak's big start.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't pleased," Jackson said. "I know Kobe won't be pleased
with his game, either. I felt Wally Szczerbiak got going early and he
tried to match. Sometimes that takes the rest of us out of our game.
That's something that we haven't done very often this year."</TE>
<TE>   The Laker deficit was 11 a minute into the second quarter, causing
Bryant to try to force his game on the Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was caught up with Wally, I would have gone right at him,"
he said. "Somebody had to put points on the board, hold back the
momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the game, with Minnesota's victory assured, Garnett
blocked Bryant's shot from behind, though a foul already had been
called. Garnett, an emotive sort, snapped something to Bryant, and
Bryant woofed back. The Timberwolves were on their way to scoring 44
points more than they did against the Lakers on Dec. 1, in a large
loss at Staples Center, and Garnett felt it.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, just two guys having fun," Bryant said. "But I look forward
to coming back. What, February sometime? I'm really, really, really
looking forward to it."</TE>
<TE>   By the postgame, the Lakers already were in 82-game survival mode,
mostly respectful of the Timberwolves, but dubious too. Asked if he
thought Rasho Nesterovic, the Timberwolves' youthful center, had
improved any, O'Neal said, "No. Just a lot of help from the referees.
Just like every other bum center in this league."</TE>

<LD>As a longtime season-ticket holder for the Angels and Mighty Ducks, I
was overjoyed last Saturday morning when I read that Tony Tavares had
resigned his position with the organization. That joy is tempered by
the fact, though, that Disney still remains the owner. The quicker
Disney sells the teams to a committed ownership group, the better off
the Orange County sports community will be.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad Michael Eisner and Pierre Gauthier didn't resign with
Tavares. Then the Ducks would have had a hat trick. That might be the
only way their anemic offense could score one.</LD>

<LD>So Bud Selig broke the rules of major league baseball by taking a
$3-million loan from a fellow owner (who now stands to make about $50
million off that investment by way of contraction) without the
consent of the rest of the owners, and the owners rally around Selig
saying it's OK.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Pete Rose is still denied a return to major league baseball
and entry into the Hall of Fame, and the reason we are always given
for this: "He broke the rules of baseball!"</LD>
<LD>   Sounds like a double standard to me. If Selig doesn't step down
immediately, his next move should be to let Rose back into baseball
and into the Hall.</LD>

<LD>In regard to Tim Russell's letter last Saturday about the abuse the
Nebraska fans took in Los Angeles:</LD>
<LD>   Tim says that the Cornhuskers were booed twice in Staples Center.
Hey Tim, the Clippers get booed more than that, and that's their
floor!</LD>
<LD>   He said that they were treated rudely? Hey Tim, ever see someone
walking around Lincoln with an OU shirt on get treated with respect?</LD>
<TE>   Tim, we weren't mad that the BCS put you in the Rose Bowl. We were
mad that you ruined what should have been a good game.</TE>
<TE>   So if an apology is what you're after Tim, let me just say this:</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry that you didn't get to play Miami for the championship
in the Orange Bowl. And I'm really sorry that all you have in your
life to get excited about is college football.</TE>

<LD>It is Jan. 5, 2002, and the front page of the L.A. Times sports
section has a one-sentence acknowledgement of the Clippers' victory
at Denver last night.</LD>
<LD>   I know that The Times is a bandwagon supporter of the Lakers like
the rest of Southern California, but I feel it is a disgrace how the
Clippers are treated by you. The Clippers are a very competitive
young NBA team that has to take a back seat to Steve Spurrier's
resignation, Dennis Green's firing, two articles on Tony Tavares'
resignation (who cares?) and articles on USC and UCLA victories.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Times, where is the love for the Clippers? Maybe they haven't
earned the coverage that the other pampered, overpaid team pro team
in the city receives, but they do deserve better treatment and more
respect than you give.</LD>

<LD>I'm no Alan Greenspan, but paying $11.3 million for exclusive rights
to negotiate with an unproven pitcher seems ridiculous, considering
the Dodger management refused to return calls from Chan Ho Park's
agent, which cost nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Interestingly, this "negotiation fee" is close to what Park gets
per season with the Rangers. Are you sure Tony Tavares isn't the new
Dodger "brains"?</LD>

<TE>   Assuming the Dodgers have Kazuhisa Ishii and Hideo Nomo in the
starting rotation, I can only imagine the potential changes that
might take place at Dodger Stadium. Will the Dodger Dog be replaced
with California rolls? Will beer be replaced with sake? Will the
mini-bat promotion be replaced with twirling umbrella night?</TE>
<TE>   And what about Godzilla night?</TE>

<TE>   Because Southern California doesn't really experience a change in
seasons, like other parts of the country, we in L.A. can now tell
when spring is approaching. We will know because that will be around
the time Gary Sheffield starts running his mouth about his horrible
situation. Maybe when Gary sticks his head out to talk, we can find
out if it will be a long winter, or only six weeks until spring
training.</TE>

<TE>   I see where the first two acts of the annual Gary Sheffield farce
have gone as scheduled:</TE>
<TE>   In Act I, Gary moans and complains to anyone who will listen that
he is unappreciated by the Dodgers and hints that he may not be able
to perform unless they show him more respect.</TE>
<TE>   In Act II, Dodger fans flood the letters-to-the-editor section the
following Saturday, making him sound like baseball's version of Osama
bin Laden and urging the Dodgers to trade him for anything they can
get.</TE>
<TE>   All that remains to be seen is whether Act III--Sheffield homers
on opening day and Dodger fans rise as one to chant his name and
cheer his every move--is repeated this year.</TE>

<DL>GAINESVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Quarterback Rex Grossman handed new Florida Coach Ron Zook his first
big triumph Friday when he announced he would return to the Gators
for his junior season.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the hardest decision I've had to make in my entire life,"
Grossman said. "It was going to be a big decision either way. But I'm
glad I'm coming back."</LD>
<LD>   Rejoining him will be receiver Taylor Jacobs, who said he would
return. Neither Grossman nor Taylor was considering leaving before
former coach Steve Spurrier's unexpected resignation.</LD>
<TE>   Grossman told reporters there was no way he would have stayed had
there not been a coach in place by Friday, the deadline for
underclassmen to declare for the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   With little-known Zook on the job, it remained a tough decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I went from 90% sure I was leaving, to 60% sure I was staying,
and all over the board," Grossman said.</TE>
<TE>   A series of meetings with Zook and new offensive coordinator Ed
Zaunbrecher persuaded Grossman to stay.</TE>
<TE>   His decision took on greater urgency when backup Brock Berlin
announced Thursday night that he was transferring to Miami.</TE>

<HD>Skating Goes to Cable as ABC Plays Wild Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in 39 years, the women's free skate final in the
U.S. Figure Skating Championship--usually a ratings winner--will be
relegated to cable, yet another far-reaching effect of Sept.11.</LD>
<LD>   The terrorist attacks and the subsequent postponement of NFL games
led to a programming headache for ABC, which is broadcasting today's
NFL wild-card games. As a result, tonight's figure skating final at
Staples Center featuring Michelle Kwan, Sasha Cohen, Sarah Hughes and
Angela Nikodinov will be carried live by ABC Family Channel at 8 p.m.
in the East and on a three-hour delay at 8 on the West Coast. ABC
will repeat the telecast Sunday at 2 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately, we had to move the figure skating," said Loren
Matthews, ABC senior vice president of programming.</LD>
<TE>   The move to cable was permitted under the 10-year, $100-million
contract that runs through the 2006-7 season and pays the U.S. Figure
Skating Assn.. $10 million a year for the TV rights to the U.S.
championships and four other events.</TE>
<TE>   "These things happen," said John LeFevre, USFSA executive
director. "Sure, we'd love to have the network exposure, but we
understand ABC's problem. It was their call."</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating can be found on television year-round for a simple
reason: Check the Nielsen ratings and it often ranks at or near the
top, thanks to an unusually large number of female viewer.</TE>
<TE>   The women's free skate final at the U.S. championships last year
drew a national rating of 6.0.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings the three previous years were 7.7 in 2000, 6.7 in 1999
and 11.5 in 1998, the last Olympic year.</TE>
<TE>   Regular-season college football on ABC this past season averaged
4.0, the four BCS bowl games 10.6 and "Monday Night Football" 11.5.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating gave television the third-highest rating ever for a
sports event, sixth-highest for any program.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding--competing against
each other for the first time in the wake of Kerrigan's infamous knee
bashing--skated the technical program in the 1994 Winter Olympics at
Lillehammer, Norway. CBS got a 48.5 rating with a 64% share of the
prime-time audience.</TE>
<TE>   In sports, that ranks behind only the two top-rated Super Bowls,
which rank fourth and fifth overall. The three highest rated programs
are, in order, the last episode of "M*A*S*H," the "Who Shot J.R.?"
episode of "Dallas," and Part 8 of the "Roots" miniseries.</TE>
<TE>   The women's final at Lillehammer got 44.1, the 32nd highest rating
of all time.</TE>
<TE>   It could be argued that the '94 Olympic ratings were artificially
high because of the soap opera that surrounded Kerrigan and Harding,
whose then-husband was linked to the attack on Kerrigan. But the
women's figure skating final two years earlier at Albertville,
France, produced a 25.0 rating and a 40 share.</TE>
<TE>   Skating fans say the sport offers a unique perspective and an
unusually close look at the athletes. Every emotion is visible.</TE>
<TE>   "The setting is very intimate and easy to televise," said Phyllis
Howard, the president of the USFSA. "It's held in an indoor arena and
an enclosed rink and the cameras can get up close and very personal.
And it is an individual sport, so you can create individual stories."</TE>
<TE>   It's also markedly different than team sports, said Terry Gannon,
ABC's lead announcer on figure skating, who played on the 1983 NCAA
basketball championship team at North Carolina State.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess what intrigues me the most is that skaters are all alone
out there on the ice," he said. "I played a team sport where you had
teammates to rely on."</TE>
<TE>   The USFSA's LeFevre says, "Figure skating is one of the few sports
where there's sports and art combined. So it appeals to a wide range.
Even people who would not otherwise watch sports watch figure skating
because of the artistic aspect. Then there is the judging, It's
intriguing."</TE>
<TE>   That, and the mix of artistry and athleticism, and the costumes,
are a few of the reasons why it attracts such devoted fans as Shari
Martineau of Harbor City, who was at Staples this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch every ice skating event on TV," Martineau said. "I tape
it when I'm not there to watch it. ... I like ballet, and there's a
lot of that in it. The skills and the grace are a wonderful
combination. I always say if I die and have another life, I'd like to
come back with the grace of Kristi Yamaguchi and the jumping ability
of Midori Ito."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's broadcast and Sunday's repeat will include the women's
short program, taped earlier this week, as well as the free skate
competition.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Family Channel until recently was Fox Family Channel. It
reaches 84.1 million of the nation's 105.5 million television
households.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, ABC was planning to carry the women's free skate
final for the 39th time. But after the attacks the NFL postponed its
Sept. 15 games, rescheduling them Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The rescheduling delayed the start of the NFL playoffs a week. And
because ABC carries the Saturday wild-card games on the first weekend
of playoffs and the starting times had already been set for 1:30 and
5 p.m.--4:30 and 8 p.m. in the East--skating had to move.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN or ESPN2 were considered, but Disney, ABC's parent company,
chose its newest cable channel.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt ABC Family would be the perfect fit since figure skating
is something that appeals to the whole family," Matthews said.</TE>

<LD>Four women, four memorable short programs, four potential Olympic
medalists.</LD>
<LD>   Three spots on the U.S. figure skating team at the Salt Lake City
Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Someone's dreams will be shattered tonight at Staples Center after
the women's free skate, the final event of the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships.</LD>
<TE>   Defending champion Michelle Kwan, seeking her fifth consecutive
title and sixth overall, was the leader after the first phase of the
competition. However, 17-year-old Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel
pressed her with a graceful, animated performance and was a strong
second. Sarah Hughes was third, faulted by the judges for her jump
technique, but her victory over Kwan and Russia's Irina Slutskaya two
months ago at Skate Canada was proof she ranks among the world's
best.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro was fourth after Thursday's short
program, bravely maintaining her composure while mourning the death
in November of her beloved coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia. Grateful for
the sentimental support she received Thursday, she hopes to honor
Tcherkasskaia's memory tonight in her "Giselle" program by fulfilling
the enormous potential the Russian-born coach had only begun to
extract.</TE>
<TE>   The four-minute free program is worth two-thirds of the final
score. Any of the top three can win the championship by being ranked
first tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "Olympic team or no Olympic team, I just want to go out and skate
my best," Nikodinov said Friday after practicing at Staples Center.
"[Thursday] was a special performance. I didn't want to give myself
extra pressure and say I have to skate well, but I knew Michelle and
Sarah had skated cleanly ahead of me. I told myself to let it go, and
I didn't give in ...</TE>
<TE>   "I did pull it out, and I didn't let anybody down. It doesn't
matter where I place, as long as I know I gave 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said her long program, to excerpts of "Daphnis et Chloe"
and Rachmaninov, allows her more opportunity to display her
versatility than her "Ave Maria" short program because it's longer
and more challenging.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not cut-and-paste. I can show off more of my strengths,"
Hughes said. "I don't think you can ever be conservative, and my
program is not conservative. It has all of my most difficult elements
in it. I have to. The ladies' [event] is a difficult competition."</TE>
<TE>   All four women practiced Friday morning at Staples, and all but
Hughes also skated Friday afternoon at HealthSouth Training Center in
El Segundo. Hughes' coach, Robin Wagner, said they skipped the second
session to spare her the need to adjust to different ice conditions
and rink temperatures. Only Kwan didn't speak to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who will skate to Bizet's "Carmen," got into character by
wearing red at both workouts Friday. Like the other three prime
contenders, she appeared calm and confident, and said she wasn't
nervous about being in such a prominent position.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it adds to the pressure, because it puts me in good
position to make the Olympic team," said Cohen, who burst onto the
scene at the 2000 national championships by finishing second to Kwan
but missed last year's competition because of a fractured vertebra.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing clean run-throughs at home [in Aliso Viejo], and
I want to just go out there and do what I've been doing every day....</TE>
<TE>   "I really would like to go to the Olympics, but I know I need to
do a great long [program]."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen won't make a fourth attempt at becoming the first woman to
land a quadruple jump, wisely avoiding unnecessary risks with so much
at stake. That's a rare victory for her coach and sometime sparring
partner, John Nicks, who often butts heads with the strong-willed
teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Nicks said he wasn't surprised to see Cohen place ahead of Hughes,
who had better results in Grand Prix events, or Nikodinov. "The last
three or four weeks, in particular, Sasha has trained quite well,"
Nicks said. "She seems to understand more the word 'consistency.'</TE>
<TE>   "She has put herself in a very good position, but as you know, you
can't win the competition in the short program, but you can lose it.
She did not lose it."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan's "Sheherezade" program includes one triple-triple
combination jump and five other triples. She had some difficulty
Friday landing her triple loop, a jump that has given her problems in
the past, but she earned warm ovations from the several hundred fans
scattered in the seats at Staples Center and the hundreds more
huddled in the bleachers at HealthSouth later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-year-old Torrance native will skate first among the last
six skaters, followed by Nikodinov, Cohen, Hughes, Ann Patrice
McDonough--who was fifth after the short program--and Jennifer Kirk,
who was sixth.</TE>
<TE>   A victory tonight would elevate Kwan to an even loftier place in
the figure skating record books: A sixth title would tie her for
second with Theresa Weld Blanchard and Gretchen Merrill, behind only
the nine won by Maribel Vinson.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever makes it, the U.S. is going to have a wonderful Olympic
team," Nicks said.</TE>

<LD>   Long Beach State (5-10, 1-3) at Utah State (11-3, 3-2), 6 PST,
KRLA (870)--Long Beach had a chance to put together a two-game
winning streak before its Big West Conference game at Logan, Utah,
but the 49ers lost to Idaho, 69-67, on Thursday. Long Beach committed
22 turnovers, helping Idaho to its first conference victory this
season. Long Beach might have caught a break, however, because UC
Irvine ended Utah State's 31-game home winning streak on Thursday.
Utah State, which won the Big West tournament last season and
defeated Ohio State in the NCAA tournament, suffered its first defeat
at home since Jan. 8, 2000, when it lost to Brigham Young.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State Fullerton (3-10, 0-4) at UC Riverside (5-7, 2-2), 7,
KPRO (1570)--Fullerton will try to end a losing streak that reached
five games last Saturday when the Titans lost to Long Beach State,
68-60. Fullerton is 0-4 in the Big West for the first time since the
1993-94 season. The Titans need more production on the boards from
center Babacar Camara, who is averaging only 1.3 rebounds the last
three games. That does not bode well against a Riverside team led by
center Vili Morton, who is averaging 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds in
conference play. Riverside lost to Irvine, 72-53, last Saturday.</LD>

<TE>   Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (9-4, 3-2) at Cal State Northridge (3-10,
2-2), 7, KDOC (Channel 56)--Northridge needs a victory to avoid
falling into the bottom half of the Big West Conference standings.
The Matadors, in a three-way tie for fifth place, have struggled
offensively and are shooting 39.1% from the field after making only
16 of 55 shots Thursday in a 57-54 loss to UC Santa Barbara.
Northridge missed its first 13 shots and didn't make its first field
goal until 10:33 had elapsed. The scrappy Matadors again relied on
defense, forcing 20 turnovers, to stay in the game. They will need
another spirited effort against Cal Poly, which was off to its best
Big West start since 1991-92 until losing at Pacific, 70-54,
Thursday. The Mustangs made only 22 of 64 shots and forward Brandon
Beeson, a senior forward from Irvine Woodbridge High, was held to
four points on two-for-eight shooting after averaging 18.5 points in
the previous two games.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine (11-4, 4-0) at Idaho (4-10, 1-4), 7, KUCI-FM
(88.9)--Irvine sits alone on top of the Big West after its one-point
win at Utah State Thursday on Jerry Green's buzzer-beater. The
Anteaters must avoid a letdown against a struggling Idaho team that
got its first conference victory over Long Beach. Forward Jordan
Harris and Stanislav Zuzak combined for only seven points on
three-of-15 shooting against the Aggies.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara (10-4, 4-1) at Pacific (10-4, 2-2), 7--The
Gauchos, who lead the Big West in field-goal percentage defense,
limited Northridge to below 30% shooting in its victory. They've
allowed teams to shoot only 40% or worse in 10 of 14 games. Santa
Barbara swept the two regular-season games last year, but Pacific won
in a first-round tournament game. Guard Branduinn Fullove has scored
20 or more points in three of the last four games.</TE>

<LD>One down, one to go.</LD>
<LD>   With the confirmation earlier this week that Oscar De La Hoya and
Fernando Vargas have agreed to fight May 4, the focus has shifted to
the negotiations for a heavyweight title fight between champion
Lennox Lewis and challenger Mike Tyson in Las Vegas on April 6.</LD>
<LD>   The competing cable networks--HBO has the rights to Lewis,
Showtime to Tyson--appear to have worked out their differences,
removing the major obstacle.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis and Tyson have moved from a 75-25 purse distribution to
something much closer to an even split.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the hang-up?</TE>
<TE>   What's always the hang-up in a Tyson fight? Tyson, of course.</TE>
<TE>   His latest problems involve:</TE>
<TE>   * An investigation into sexual assault charges against the former
two-time heavyweight champion over an incident that allegedly
occurred in his Las Vegas home in September.</TE>
<TE>   * His mysterious appearance in Cuba, and the legality of his trip
there. Staying in a Havana hotel over the New Year's holiday, Tyson
became agitated when media representatives showed up. He lightly
punched a cameraman in the head and threw small, glittering balls at
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   * The possibility that either or both of the above incidents would
prompt the Nevada State Athletic Commission to deny him a license.</TE>
<TE>   * A picture of Tyson in Cuba that showed his stomach hanging well
over his belt. Tyson, who tends to get badly out of shape between
fights, might have put on 30-40 pounds, according to some sources.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with Tyson there are always questions. He averages
about one postponement per fight.</TE>
<TE>   And even if and when a deal is struck, there will be rumors that
the fight is off right through April 5. That's standard with any
Tyson promotion.</TE>
<TE>   But before an agreement can be signed for a Las Vegas site, Tyson
must reapply for a Nevada license. His lapsed two years ago. And
Luther Mack, chairman of the five-man Nevada commission, promises his
group won't be blinded by the potential dollars that could flow into
the state from such a match.</TE>
<TE>   "This will not be automatic," Mack said. "These incidents [in Cuba
and at Tyson's home] will certainly come up. These are serious
allegations. I want to ask him why he was in Cuba and what took
place. I want specific answers. Tell me exactly what happened. Don't
beat around the bush. We need to have the truth. There is no
guarantee that he will get a license."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that, and even though an aging Tyson appears to have
little if any chance against Lewis, this figures to be a popular,
lucrative match.</TE>
<TE>   It will pit Lewis, the soft-spoken Englishman, against Tyson, the
vulgar American. It will match the tall, skilled boxer, Lewis,
against Tyson, the short, heavy puncher.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be Lewis against David Tua, but it won't be much better.
Tua, similar in build to Tyson, appeared to give up in the second
round of his title match against Lewis in November 2000, and meekly
lost a unanimous decision. The outmatched Tyson will also lose,
perhaps by knockout, perhaps by decision, perhaps by disqualification
if he does something stupid out of frustration over his failure to
get to Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part for Lewis will be to get the deal made.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Cuba</TE>
<TE>   Also tough to make was tonight's 130-pound unification match
between World Boxing Assn. champion Joel Casamayor (26-0, 16
knockouts) of Cuba and World Boxing Organization titleholder Acelino
Freitas (30-0, 29) of Brazil at Cox Pavilion in Las Vegas' Thomas &amp;
Mack Center.</TE>
<TE>   The fight was postponed several times because of Freitas, which,
Casamayor says, has generated in him a lot of pent-up fury.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of my frustration is because of that," Casamayor said. "If
he is supposed to be a great champion, then why were there all these
big excuses not to fight me? I just hope he doesn't back out again,
find another excuse not to show up.</TE>
<TE>   "He talks a lot of trash, but when he gets in front of me, he does
not even look me in the eye. That just shows me he is not the man he
thinks he is.</TE>
<TE>   "Freitas is afraid of me. When I go in there, I am like a Cuban
warrior with a machete on my side and a knife in my mouth. This
should be my easiest fight. I am going to put a hurt on him."</TE>
<TE>   Countered Freitas: "It took so long for this fight to be made
because I had managerial problems and promotional problems. When a
fighter</TE>
<TE>   goes into the ring, he should go with a clear head. This is the
perfect time for me to fight Casamayor."</TE>
<TE>   Freitas predicts this fight will be as big as the Super Bowl in
Brazil. Casamayor says everybody in Cuba will be watching.</TE>
<TE>   Even Tyson?</TE>

<HD>Gonzaga Holds Off Santa Clara</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Dickau scored 29 points, and No. 18 Gonzaga survived a furious
second-half comeback and a career-high 38 points by Steve Ross at
Spokane, Wash., to defeat Santa Clara, 83-81, Friday night for its
11th consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   Ross had 22 points in the second half for the Broncos (5-9, 0-1
West Coast Conference), who lost for the first time in five games.
Gonzaga (14-2, 1-0), is off to its best start since the 1966-67
season.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing by 12 points at halftime, Santa Clara mounted a strong
comeback early in the second half.</LD>
<TE>   Justin Holbrook's three-point basket brought Santa Clara within
60-59. But Dickau responded with a pair of three-pointers to lift
Gonzaga to a 66-59 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs led, 77-69, with 3:22 left, and their full-court
press slowed the Broncos' attack as time ticked off the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Bailey's three-pointer for Santa Clara cut Gonzaga's lead to
79-76 with 25 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   But the Broncos were forced to foul, and Blake Stepp made two free
throws before Bailey made a jumper to make it 81-78 with 13 seconds
left. Stepp then sank one of two free throws. Bailey's three-point
attempt bounced off the front of the rim to end Santa Clara's hopes.
Ross hit a final three-pointer for the Broncos as time expired.</TE>

<TE>   Kentucky unexpectedly granted a release to former basketball
player Marvin Stone, allowing him to play for former Wildcat Coach
Rick Pitino at archrival Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Tubby] Smith and I met this morning, and Coach Smith has
had a change of heart," Kentucky Athletic Director Larry Ivy said.
"He has agreed, and I also concurred, that we will release him to the
University of Louisville."</TE>
<TE>   Stone, a 6-foot-10 junior and former McDonald's All-American at
Grissom High in Huntsville, Ala., can be offered a scholarship to
play at Louisville after sitting out a season under NCAA transfer
rules. He would have one full season of eligibility remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Pitino, who coached at Kentucky from 1989-97, said he would talk
with Stone about joining the program.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Clippers look like deer in headlights in
final 1:25 of regulation, blow eight-point lead and lose to Hornets
in overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Lamar Odom rubbed a weary hand over his scalp, letting out a heavy
sigh. Elton Brand conducted his first interview of the season without
smiling. Eric Piatkowski answered questions dutifully, but stared
into space, as if trying to make sense of what he had just witnessed.</LD>
<LD>   All around the Clippers' locker room Friday were looks of
frustration and disbelief. They had a game won against the Charlotte
Hornets. And then they didn't.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers failed to protect an eight-point lead with 1:25
remaining. They failed to make free throws. They failed to defend
three-point shots. They failed to win on the road for the 12th time
in 14 games, dropping a victory into the Hornets' laps, 92-91, in
overtime at the Charlotte Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   "All we needed was one stop," Odom said. "We never got it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brand: "It doesn't seem real."</TE>
<TE>   Added Piatkowski: "This one hurts more than any other game this
season."</TE>
<TE>   After taking a 76-68 lead when Jeff McInnis' three-point basket
narrowly beat the 24-second clock with 1:25 left in regulation, the
Clippers collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte got hot and won its third consecutive. The Clippers have
lost a season-high four in a row and slipped below the .500 mark
(18-19) for the first time since they were 9-10 on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Hornet guard David Wesley, who had missed eight of nine shots,
made three three-point baskets and Bryce Drew one in the final 1:07
and the Hornets forced the Clippers to overtime, tied, 82-82. Drew's
basket tied the score with 7.7 seconds left and sent an announced
crowd of 13,087 into a frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   The game went to the five-minute extra period because the Clippers
failed to smother the Hornets on the perimeter. They lost in overtime
because they couldn't make free throws, missing four of five.</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi's first basket of the game, on a hook
over Charlotte's Elden Campbell, had given the Clippers a 91-90 lead
in overtime. Brand blocked Campbell's short shot on the Hornets' next
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Forced to foul, the Hornets grabbed Odom with 20.7 seconds
remaining. Odom calmly stepped to the line and missed both free
throws. Campbell missed at the other end, but Olowokandi slapped the
rebound out of bounds with 5.2 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte called a timeout, setting up a play that looked
ridiculously easy in hindsight. Baron Davis inbounded the ball to
Campbell on the low block, got it back and drove to the basket to
score the go-ahead basket with 1.5 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had one final chance, but Darius Miles' jump shot
from the right wing fell short at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   "This game was ours," Piatkowski said. "I don't know how many
times I said that during the game. This will be one of those nights
when I won't be able to sleep."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers built a 17-point lead, but Charlotte narrowed it to
10 by halftime. The Clippers led, 62-51, to start the fourth quarter
and seemed to have control even after Charlotte went on a 9-3 run.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis' jump shot over Drew from the left baseline gave the
Clippers a 67-62 lead. The Clippers seemed to have the Hornets
running on a treadmill at that point, working hard but failing to
draw nearer than five points.</TE>
<TE>   When McInnis made his desperation three-point basket to beat the
24-second clock, putting the Clippers up by eight with 1:25 left, it
appeared the game was over. But Wesley made the first of the Hornets'
four three-pointers and things got tighter instead of easier for the
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Boykins had one final chance to seal the victory for the
Clippers in regulation, but made only one of two free throws for a
three-point lead with 23.3 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We just found a way to win," Charlotte Coach Paul Silas said.</TE>
<TE>   And, despite 22 points each from Odom and Brand, the Clippers
found a way to lose. It was that simple.</TE>

<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Clipper forward Lamar Odom was benched for all but 3:04 of the first
quarter because he missed the team bus to the Charlotte Coliseum on
Friday. He took a taxi to the arena from the team's hotel.</LD>
<LD>   Odom was a bit sheepish about the whole affair after the Clippers
lost in overtime to the Charlotte Hornets, 92-91.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a team rule," he said. "Coach [Alvin Gentry] decided to
bring me in off the bench. I have no excuse. Rules are rules. It's no
big deal. I'm a man. I can face the punishment."</LD>
<TE>   Odom served an eight-game suspension earlier this season for
violating terms of the NBA's antidrug policy. He also sat out three
games because of a sprained right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also sat Odom for the start of the second half Friday. Odom
had 22 points, six rebounds and five assists in 37 minutes against
the Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were without swingman Corey Maggette, who sat out
because of a strained right knee. Despite various nagging injuries,
Maggette had played all 36 games before Friday. His status for
Sunday's game against the Toronto Raptors was uncertain.</TE>

<LD>It is time for the big finish, time to take all the sparkly things
out of the bag, time to "release the emotion," to "feel the music,"
and it's especially time to "cut off Samson's hair," in the
figurative sense.</LD>
<LD>   It is time for the ice dancing free dance at the U.S. Figure
Skating Championships. At noon today at Staples Center, the couples
can rumba, waltz, swing, dance the blues, twirl to the Spanish
Medley. Two U.S. Olympic spots will be awarded.</LD>
<LD>   One Olympic berth is just about guaranteed to Naomi Lang and Peter
Tchernyshev. Lang and Tchernyshev, three-time defending champions,
earned the only perfect score of the week Thursday night during their
original dance and have earned every first-place score from each of
the nine judges through the two compulsory dances and the original
dance.</LD>
<TE>   Lang, 23, and Tchernyshev, 30, are aiming for their first Olympic
trip and will skate their free program to the music "Parisian
Walkway." Tchernyshev, Russian-born, gained his U.S. citizenship last
year and says it would be his greatest dream to represent the U.S. in
the Olympics. "Especially this year, after all that has happened,"
says Tchernyshev, whose Hackensack, N.J., apartment window faces the
spot where the World Trade Center used to stand.</TE>
<TE>   The second Olympic spot will go to one of the teams currently in
third and fifth place.</TE>
<TE>   Tanith Belbin, 17, of Kirkland, Canada, and Benjamin Agosto, 19,
of Beverly Hills, Mich., have been solidly in second place from the
start of the competition but are ineligible for the Olympics until
Belbin can gain U.S. citizenship. Also ineligible are the
fourth-place skaters, Melissa Gregory and her Russian partner, Denis
Petukhov.</TE>
<TE>   In third place going into the free dance are 25-year-old Beata
Handra of San Rafael, Calif., and 33-year-old Charles Sinek of
Lexington, Mass. Sinek is the oldest skater in any discipline here
and, as he says, making the Olympics would be special "because, let's
face it, I don't have a lot of time left in me."</TE>
<TE>   Handra and Sinek historically have been strong in the compulsory
and original dances. They have never finished better than fourth at
nationals, though they have stood as high as second after the first
two rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Handra and Sinek plan to tell the story of Samson and Delilah in
their free dance, which counts for 50% of the final score Challenging
Handra and Sinek for the Olympic spot will be the fifth-place team of
Jessica Joseph, 19, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Brandon Forsyth,
22, of Lexington, Mass. Joseph skated in the 1998 Nagano Olympics
with former partner Charles Butler.</TE>

<HD>For a Change, Things Go the Ducks' Way</HD>
<DH>Hockey: McInnis' first goal in 16 games helps fuel rally
from two-goal deficit that ties the Wild and ends a five-game losing
streak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>It has reached a point where even the Mighty Ducks seem to expect the
worst ... and for once they were pleasantly surprised when the sky
didn't fall on them.</LD>
<LD>   Marty McInnis got a kind deflection off the stick of a Minnesota
Wild player. He was left with the puck at his feet and an open net
before his eyes early in the second period Friday. Only one thing
could happen.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought for sure [the goalie] was going to dive across and make
a save on me," McInnis said.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, the worst-case scenario wasn't the Ducks' fate for a change.
McInnis scored his first goal in 16 games. The Ducks rallied, then
held on for a 2-2 tie against the Wild in front of 18,568 at the Xcel
Energy Center.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis and Paul Kariya, goal-less in his last seven games,
scored. Goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere made two big saves at the end
of the third period. A five-game losing streak came to an end.</TE>
<TE>   For once all was well in Duckville ... for the most part.</TE>
<TE>   They got outshot, 14-5, after the second period by a Wild team
that played Thursday night in Nashville. They had to survive two
defensive blunders in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Ruslan Salei turned the puck over in the Duck zone and Giguere
bailed him out by making a save on Andrew Brunette's point-blank
backhand try with fewer than three minutes left. A minute later, Oleg
Tverdovsky turned the puck over in the Duck zone and Giguere needed
to make another desperate save, this time on Wes Walz.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing sometimes, you wonder," Duck Coach Bryan Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' winless streak reached seven and left their record at
13-24-6-3. After 46 games last season, they were 14-22-6-4 and on
their way to a last-place finish in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, everyone should be happy with the effort," Giguere said.
"It wasn't easy, a lot of guys are tired, but we came back and it
doesn't happen very often."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks rallied for a tie for the first time this season, having
blown leads in their five previous ties.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that good? I hope it is," Murray said. "We just need a win for
this team now. We get so tight late in games because we've had a
little streak here where we haven't scored a lot of goals and haven't
won. We have to get some wins for their mental state."</TE>
<TE>   Therapy wasn't going well when the Wild went up, 2-0, early in the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Filip Kuba whipped a shot through a crowd that beat Giguere for a
1-0 lead 13 minutes 14 seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Antti Laaksonen took two hacks at a rebound by the post, the
second knocking the puck under Giguere 39 seconds into the second.
The goal light did not go on. Referee Dean Warren did not signal a
goal. But the video goal judge ruled it a goal, leaving the Ducks a
bit confused.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told by a couple people who were involved, it never crossed
the line," Murray said. "I asked the referee why he went upstairs. He
said he wasn't sure."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kariya: "The goal judge said it didn't go in. The referee was
right there, no one has a better view than him, and he didn't call a
goal."</TE>
<TE>   Well, Giguere had a better view.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it was in," he said. "You would have known if it wasn't a
real goal. I would have lost it."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the Ducks seemed beaten.</TE>
<TE>   After all, they had only 12 goals in their previous seven games.</TE>
<TE>   But McInnis got a ricochet and scored a minute after Laaksonen's
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Another one bounced the Ducks' way midway through the period. With
the Ducks on a power play, a Samuel Pahlsson pass went off a Wild
skate and to Kariya in the slot. He wound up and buried a shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have 100 shots," McInnis said. "How many shots can you
have and not score? You just got to keep getting yourself in the
right spot, keep throwing pucks on net and the bounces will come."</TE>

<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Desperate times call for desperate measures.</LD>
<LD>   The Mighty Ducks put Sergei Krivokrasov back in the lineup Friday
against the Minnesota Wild, hoping to find someone to boost their
offense. Krivokrasov, acquired in a Nov. 1 trade with the Wild, had
been a healthy scratch the previous 12 games.</LD>
<LD>   His lengthy inactive stretch was mostly due to the defensive
liability he has been at times. Krivokrasov was a minus-three in his
last start against Columbus on Dec. 14.</LD>
<TE>   "It was frustrating," Krivokrasov said. "You have a bad game, you
want to make up for it the next. I know I was a minus-three in my
last game. I played a bad game. But you always want to come out
strong the next time." Duck Coach Bryan Murray, whose team has scored
12 goals in its last seven games, is searching for any offensive
spark, so he juggled his lines and reinserted Krivokrasov.</TE>
<TE>   Krivokrasov, who didn't have a shot in eight minutes of ice time,
has one goal in 16 games with the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just looking for a different look," Murray said. "We're going
to give Krivo a few games here, get him back into the routine. He has
to play the way he is capable of playing, but make sure he is
responsible defensively as well."</TE>

<HD>Canada Recalling Ephedrine Products</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As U.S. health experts worry about the rising use of ephedrine-based
diet and energy products by teenage athletes, Canadian health
authorities have initiated a nationwide voluntary recall of such
products, saying they can cause strokes, heart attacks, even death.</LD>
<LD>   The products, which are used by millions of Americans, have been
implicated in the deaths of more than 80 U.S. consumers and were a
subject of controversy last year when they were linked to the deaths
of two professional and two college football players.</LD>
<LD>   Health Canada, which regulates drug sales in the country, said
Thursday it was issuing letters to manufacturers, distributors and
importers of such products requesting that they discontinue their
sale within Canada and remove them from all levels of the market,
including retail.</LD>
<TE>   It also warned consumers to immediately stop using the
supplements, and return them to the points of sale.</TE>
<TE>   The recall targets all supplements containing caffeine or other
stimulants in addition to ephedrine, as well as other ephedrine
products having a single dose unit of more than eight milligrams of
ephedrine or 32 milligrams a day, or whose recommended use exceeds
seven days.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian initiative comes as a survey commissioned by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services and made public this week
found that a growing number of athletes reported using supplements
containing ephedrine in high school. The survey of 21,225 NCAA
student athletes found that of continued users, 58% reported using it
in high school, compared to 34% in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to pay attention to this," said Timothy P. Condon of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, which funded the study.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian ban is stricter than one advanced--then withdrawn--by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nearly four years ago. The FDA
proposed single-dose limits of eight milligrams and 24 milligrams per
day, but did not seek a ban of all ephedrine supplements containing
caffeine or other stimulants.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA withdrew its proposals amid attacks from the lucrative
dietary supplement industry, and a critical report from a
Congressional watchdog agency that found fault with the FDA dosing
methodology.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian ban includes some of the best-known products in the
United States--including the top-selling Metabolife 356,
Metab-O-Lite, Ripped Fuel and Ripped Force--because they contain both
ephedrine and caffeine.</TE>

<HD>Cook Shoots 62 to Lead by Three</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Cook had already posted a 62 in the second round of the Sony
Open at Honolulu when Jerry Kelly headed to the first tee.</LD>
<LD>   To see Cook's name atop the leader board brought back sour
memories. Kelly was poised to win his first PGA Tour event last year
in the Reno-Tahoe Open until he made triple bogey late in the final
round, which enabled Cook to win by a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Even more troublesome was the size of Cook's lead.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew I had to catch up, not let him have six shots between us,"
Kelly said. "I'm glad there's only three, but I wish there were
none."</TE>
<TE>   Cook had a magic number in mind, but only briefly. He had a birdie
putt on his 17th hole and a par five after that--a birdie-eagle
finish would have given him 59.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get that many chances," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't one of them. He settled for an eight-under 62 to match
his career-low round in 23 years on the PGA Tour and take a
three-stroke lead over Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   They will be paired in the final group today.</TE>
<TE>   "We can talk about Reno," Kelly said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was bitter about that loss in Nevada, Kelly shook his
head. He brought that on himself, a triple bogey on the 16th hole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not stuck in my craw," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Cook took advantage of breeze, balmy conditions to finish two
rounds at 12-under 128. That tied the 36-hole record at Waialae
Country Club, last matched a year ago by Brad Faxon, who went on to
win by four strokes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods splashed his way into contention in the New Zealand
Open today, shooting a four-under-par 67 to close within four strokes
of the lead at Paraparaumu Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had a three-under 210 total, while Australia's Stephen
Leaney topped the leaderboard at seven under after only four holes in
the round delayed by rain and flooding for 3 hours, 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Woods birdied the second and fourth holes and made an eight-foot
eagle putt on No. 6 after driving the green on the 310-yard, par-four
hole. After settling for par on the par-five seventh, he made a
curling 10-foot birdie putt on No. 8. He followed with three
consecutive pars and was in the middle of the 12th fairway when play
was suspended.</TE>
<TE>   After the delay, he returned to birdie the 12th, but dropped a
stroke with a bogey on No. 13. He made a seven-foot birdie putt on
No. 15, but lost another stroke with a bogey on No. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Woods finished with a birdie--his third of the tournament on the
par-five 18th--after just missing a 25-foot eagle putt.</TE>
<TE>   Jae An, the 13-year-old amateur from South Korea who attends
school in New Zealand, shot a 71 for a 3-over total.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Friday's sixth race at Santa Anita was scheduled for "4-year-olds and
upward," and Copelan's Eagle certainly qualified for the "upward"
part. On New Year's Day--the official birthday for
racehorses--Copelan's Eagle turned 12. That's retirement age for many
thoroughbreds but the day was only another page on the calendar for
this hearty California-bred.</LD>
<LD>   As Copelan's Eagle was led into the walking ring for Friday's
sixth, a $15,000 sprint for horses that could be claimed for $10,000,
his trainer,  A.C. Avila, admired his horse. Copelan's Eagle had
eight rivals, and the oldest was only half as old as he is.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at him," Avila said. "He's so happy, just being here. He
loves to be at the track. Every time I send him to the farm, he gets
sad and unhappy. Don't anybody tell him that he's 12 years old.
Because he doesn't know."</LD>
<TE>   In human terms, Copelan's Eagle is pushing 40, an advanced age for
someone being asked to regularly run three-quarters of a mile in
about 70 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Horses are just like people in some respects," said Pete
Pedersen, one of three stewards who officiate at the Santa Anita
races. "Many of us tail off with age, and then there are the ones
that just keep going. There used to be age limits at some tracks in
California, but not anymore, as far as I know. As long as horses stay
sound, we won't get in the way of letting them run."</TE>
<TE>   Through a 68-race career and 10 barn shifts, thanks to the
claiming box, Copelan's Eagle has run the gamut of trainers, from
hall of famer Richard Mandella to claiming mavens like Mike Mitchell.
He appears to have found a permanent home, though, with Avila, a
48-year-old horseman who left Brazil for California 11 years ago. In
February 2000, Avila claimed Copelan's Eagle from trainer Eddie
Truman for $10,000. Now, as a 12-year-old, it is unlikely the horse
will be bought out of a race again, even though he's been delivering
regular purse money since ending a 22-race losing streak in February
of last year.</TE>
<TE>   A gelding, Copelan's Eagle doesn't have a stud career ahead of
him, and jockey David Flores, who won five races with him, has been
promised the horse when he's retired from the races.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's race, Copelan's Eagle had registered two wins and
three seconds in his previous five starts, increasing his earnings to
$381,474. In the box-seat section, Avila and the horse's co-owner,
Richard Flores--no relation to the jockey--were hopeful, because
their old-timer had had some encouraging workouts at Santa Anita, the
track where he had logged nine of his 14 wins and finished in the
money 23 times in 36 tries.</TE>
<TE>   With two minutes to post, Richard Flores rushed downstairs, in the
direction of the betting windows, and by the time he got back, with
the horses loading into the gate, Copelan's Eagle was the 17-10
favorite. This was only the second time in the last 11 races that he
had been favored.</TE>
<TE>   Truman, who had claimed Copelan's Eagle three times in his career,
once for as much as $32,000, also had a horse in the race, a
6-year-old whippersnapper named C Merrill Run, but it turned out that
neither he nor Avila won. C Merrill Run finished fourth, just ahead
of Copelan's Eagle, who was beaten by almost six lengths by Jim's
Relaunch, the horse Avila had feared.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Berrio, who was riding Copelan's Eagle for the 21st time,
said that although the track was listed as fast, the surface was
loose and his mount couldn't seem to dig in.</TE>
<TE>   From the box seats, Avila knew they were done early.</TE>
<TE>   "He's too wide," the trainer said well before the horses reached
the turn. Copelan's Eagle had broken from the No. 9 post, and all the
speed inside fanned him six wide going down the backstretch.</TE>
<TE>   Copelan's Eagle didn't win his first race last year, either--in
fact, he lost his first two starts--but in February at Santa Anita,
he launched one of his best years: Three wins, six seconds and one
third in 13 starts.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out of this all right," Avila said after Friday's race.
"These older horses are smart. This horse knows how to take care of
himself and won't get hurt if he can help it. I'll try to find
another spot for him in about three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   When Copelan's Eagle won on opening day at Del Mar in July, no one
could recall a horse as old as 11 winning at the seaside track. But
if he wins during the current meet at Santa Anita, he will not be the
oldest horse to win a race there. In 1969, Victory Beauty was 13 when
she bagged the last of her 10 victories at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Copelan's Eagle is even farther away from the feats of Stonehenge
and Maxwell G., thoroughbred graybeards that were winning races when
they were 16-year-olds in the 1970s. Stonehenge's last win was at the
now-defunct Commodore Downs in Erie, Pa., and the Chicago-based
Maxwell G., a coast-to-coast campaigner, ran 234 times and won 47
races.</TE>

<HD>Donovan Impressive in Taking Title</HD>

<LD>From the moment Louann Donovan stepped onto the ice at Staples Center
to the fist-pumping salute she gave the crowd at the end of her long
program, her eyes, body language and attitude said the same thing:
This is my time, this is my championship.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-year-old Boston native was in command of the U.S. figure
skating junior women's final Friday, landing her triple jumps solidly
and gliding over the ice with a combination of power and confidence
beyond her youth.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously you have to be confident in yourself. But I just
concentrated on skating my best and not worrying about the results,"
said Donovan, who was sixth in last year's junior final but got all
the top marks from the nine judges to defeat Jennifer Don of Sugar
Land, Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Donovan was the first skater in the second group Friday and had to
watch five other competitors try to match her scores.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was a different feeling for Colette Appel and Lee Harris.</TE>
<TE>   They came to the junior pair finals this week hoping to learn from
the experience. They left as the 2002 champions Friday after their
polished performance and a bad outing for short-program leaders Amy
Howerton of Rockwall, Texas, and Steven Pottenger of Coppell, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Appel, 15 from West Hartford, Conn., and Harris, 20, from
Wethersfield, Conn., who were second after the short program, have
been a pairs team for slightly more than a year. They were appearing
in their first national competition and third overall, winning the
2002 Eastern Sectional and taking second in the 2001 Indy Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday they skated like a veteran duo, moving easily and
confidently from one element to the next. They skated just before the
final pair and had to wait to see if their marks, varying from 4.8s
to 5.3s, would stand up.</TE>
<TE>   They did because Howerton fell twice when tossed in the air by
Pottenger during their long program. Their scores, ranging from 4.2s
to 5.1s, dropped them to fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just amazing," Appel said. "We were hoping just to make
the U.S. team, which we accomplished in August. We were coming here
just to skate well and have fun."</TE>

<LD>Jason Allison's homecoming Thursday night was obviously a bitter
disappointment for the all-star center, who was held without a shot
on goal in a 5-0 loss to the Boston Bruins, but Coach Andy Murray
suspects he'll get over it in a hurry.</LD>
<LD>   "It's one hockey game out of 82," the coach said. "It's kind of
like with my kids. They play a game and five minutes after a game
they've lost, they're wanting to get hot dogs and a Coke and move on
with their lives.</LD>
<LD>   "That will be the same with Jason. He'll pack this game away and
be ready to play [today against the San Jose Sharks]. That's the
nature of the profession."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Mair today serves the last game of his 10-game suspension for
leaving the bench to join a brawl Dec. 20 against the Ottawa
Senators. After that, the rookie winger's future is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "The coaching staff really liked what Adam brought to the table in
the three or four games that he played with us," General Manager Dave
Taylor said. "He brought some energy, played physical, went hard in
the corners, went hard to the net.</TE>
<TE>   "The only question we'll have is whether it would better to get
his game legs with a couple of games in Manchester [with the Kings'
American Hockey League team], or whether he's better off coming right
back in the lineup with us."</TE>

<HD>Phil Bullish on Chicago, Not Team</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson returns to Chicago today, to the banners he helped
raise, to the franchise he helped develop.</LD>
<LD>   What's left there is entirely different, of course.</LD>
<LD>   Asked if he takes any satisfaction in the demise of the Bulls,
Jackson listed the things he took no pleasure in seeing. Don't bother
looking for General Manager Jerry Krause's name here.</LD>
<TE>   "Not to the fans," Jackson said. "They deserve better. They've
stood behind this team. They've kept coming out.</TE>
<TE>   "Not for the coaching staff. Those guys work really hard.</TE>
<TE>   "[Not for] the kids. They don't know any better. None of those
kids played [in the NBA], except [Charles] Oakley, when I was
coaching there.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrogance of the organization was such that they thought they
could rebuild. They were actually looking forward to rebuilding
without Michael [Jordan] and Scottie [Pippen]. This is a challenge
they were embracing, and it was like the door couldn't shut faster.
But, the owner [Jerry Reinsdorf] approached me three times the year I
sat out, asked me if I'd return. He was the one who kept asking me to
come back."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, after two championships in two seasons, Jackson is
working on a new legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great city," Jackson said of Chicago. "Everywhere I go,
there's always somebody from Chicago that says, 'Gee, we sure miss
you in Chicago.' So I never get it out of my brain, even though the
Lakers, and Jeanie [Buss] in particular, [have] hopes my
identification becomes the Lakers rather than the Bulls."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stu Jackson, NBA vice president, is considering disciplinary
measures against Laker guard Mitch Richmond, who directed a rude
gesture at fans during Tuesday night's game in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond was leaving the floor late in the Laker rout when
television cameras recorded the gesture. TBS had left the game at
that point, but the international feed continued.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I regretted that as soon as I did it," Richmond said
Friday. "I hope no one was offended. If so, I apologize."</TE>
<TE>   The NBA expects to make a decision by Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Chicago, 5:30 PST,</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9</TE>
<TE>   Site--United Center</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570)</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 26-7, Bulls 6-29.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Bulls--(2000-01) 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Bulls start Ron Artest and Charles Oakley at the
forwards, Brad Miller at center and Ron Mercer and Kevin Ollie at the
guards. They won their first two games under Coach Bill Cartwright
but have lost six in succession. Mercer is averaging 17 points and
Artest is averaging 16.1. The rookies, Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry,
haven't done much, although neither is playing more than 13 minutes a
game. Oakley has said he would like to play for the Lakers next
season.</TE>

<HD>Blyleven Should Be a Hall of a Pitcher</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Another year goes by, another Hall of Fame vote, and another
noninduction for the great Bert Blyleven (287 wins, 3.31 ERA). Just
what does it take? It's mind-boggling that a man with nearly 300 wins
who is third all-time with 3,701 strikeouts is omitted. Whatever
grudge the voting writers have against Blyleven should never affect a
vote of this importance.</LD>
<LD>   With the exception of future inductees Roger Clemens (No. 7) and
Randy Johnson (No. 12), every one of the top 13 strikeout pitchers is
already in the Hall, except Blyleven. This makes the voting body look
like idiots.</LD>

<LD>Apparently, David Stern needs a telescope to see what's happening in
the NBA from his ivory tower.</LD>
<LD>   Fining Mark Cuban half a million dollars for complaining about the
officiating is ridiculous. Game officials have long ignored
violations of basketball's basic rules by its biggest stars (Kobe
carries the ball, Jordan travels in the lane, etc.) because their
play makes the game exciting and fills seats in the arenas.</LD>
<LD>   Cuban may not get style points for his ranting, but Stern had
better ask himself, "Is the NBA a better place with Cuban as an
owner?"</LD>
<TE>   I say it is.</TE>
<TE>   His ignoring the cap and luxury tax and putting the best team his
money can buy on the floor keeps the other owners honest. I don't
think there is a player in the league who would mind working for him.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Stern, if you are going to show exception to the league's
stars, you'd better swallow your pride, quit with the double standard
and let Mark have his say. He isn't wrong, just vocal about it.</TE>

<HD>A Huge Ripple Effect</HD>
<DH>McColl's Water Polo Career Was Spawned by Brother's
Drowning</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly nine years have passed since Evan's lifeless body was lifted
from the backyard swimming pool. Not a day goes by that Meridith
McColl doesn't think back to the haunting images from that warm
summer afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   McColl shivered in the cold air as she stood alongside the pool
recently at Saddleback College, vividly recalling the day her
15-month-old brother drowned. One minute he was taking a nap at their
grandparents' home in San Diego, the next he was gone forever.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of hard not to think about it every day," said McColl,
who was a second-grader at the time. "It was something that changed
our lives so much."</LD>
<TE>   If McColl and her three other brothers had never set foot near a
body of water after such a horrific experience, it would be perfectly
understandable. But their parents made sure that didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   The McColls encouraged their children to become even more at ease
in the water and introduced them to water sports. The thought was,
"If they felt safe swimming in the waves, they would feel comfortable
in a swimming pool," said Emily McColl, Meridith's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Meridith shined the brightest, quickly developing into one of the
top high school girls' water polo goalkeepers in the nation. "She
probably never would have played water polo if it wasn't for [Evan's
death]," Emily said.</TE>
<TE>   McColl, a junior at Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley High, is a
member of the U.S. national youth team and was selected All-Southern
Section Division I last season.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Nealy was impressed with McColl's abilities before he took the
Capistrano Valley coaching job last summer, and since then, he's
become equally impressed with her spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "She's got the best attitude of any kid I've coached," he said.
"She's a coach's dream."</TE>
<TE>   McColl also has what her mother calls "goalkeeper's
mentality"--she thrives under pressure and refuses to back down when
the situation looks dire. Emily said it was those instincts that
helped Meridith sidestep a fear of water.</TE>
<TE>   "She wasn't going to let the water win again," Emily said.</TE>
<TE>   Emily and her husband, Duncan McColl, rarely discuss Evan's
accident. Most of Meridith's closest friends don't even know. But as
time passes, the family finds the tragedy easier to recount.</TE>
<TE>   It began as a routine visit to Duncan's parents, while Emily
attended a CPR class near the family's home in San Diego. Halfway
through the class, Emily said she felt uneasy and left. When she
reached home, several frantic phone messages awaited. Evan had
awakened from a nap and quietly opened a back door leading to the
swimming pool. He slipped under water without a sound.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't talking yet, but very mobile, very active," Emily said.
"He didn't know how dangerous it was to open that door, but he knew
[how to open it]."</TE>
<TE>   It was only a matter of seconds before he was discovered by one of
his older brothers. Paramedics were called. A helicopter landed on
the street and Evan clung to life as he was whisked away, but he
never regained consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember everything, picture for picture, word for word,"
Meridith said of that day. "I don't feel like I've forgotten a
detail."</TE>
<TE>   The commotion from the helicopter, coupled with the McColls' close
ties to their San Diego community--Emily and Duncan are Presbyterian
ministers-- focused an uncomfortable media spotlight on the family,
Emily said. They soon moved to New Jersey, where they attempted to
put the sorrow and guilt behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "When we moved, we thought it was good to go off as a family and
be alone," Emily said. After nearly four years, the McColls were
ready to return to San Diego. When they did, they immediately
enrolled their children in a junior lifeguard program.</TE>
<TE>   "We came back and started them right up," Emily said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the McColl children were asked to join a local age-group
water polo team. Meridith, one of two girls on the team, quickly
emerged as the starting goalkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, she was invited to the U.S. Olympic training
center in Colorado Springs, Colo., where she received in-depth
training. The next year, she was invited back to Colorado Springs,
and last year she was selected to the U.S. national youth team, for
which she's the No. 1 goalkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   While McColl was in junior high, her family moved to Mission
Viejo. She made an immediate impact at Capistrano Valley as a
freshman, helping the Cougars finish second in the South Coast League
and advance to the section quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   With McColl minding the net and senior Amber Stachowski, the
Division I player of the year, providing the offense, Capistrano
Valley won the league title and advanced to the playoff semifinals
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars couldn't help but be excited about their prospects for
this season, but last spring, Amber's sister, junior Aimee
Stachowski, transferred to Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last summer, their coach, Jason Lynch, took a job at Newport
Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "[The loss of Lynch] was very unexpected," McColl said. "We got
along really well and I assumed he was going to be coaching here
again."</TE>
<TE>   Three other starters have returned this season. Capistrano Valley
(4-8) lost to Carlsbad, 6-3, and to Riverside Arlington, 9-6, Friday
in the first day of the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions, which
includes many of the best teams in the state. McColl had 15 saves
against Carlsbad.</TE>

<HD>Iverson Talks It Up After Rout of Spurs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson scored 37 points, the 76ers beat the San Antonio Spurs,
101-84, but all was still not well in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   In the 76ers' first game since Iverson criticized Coach Larry
Brown and then was kicked out of practice earlier Friday, the league
MVP made 14 of 31 shots and was nine of 10 from the free-throw line.</LD>
<LD>   But rather than discuss beating the team with the NBA's third-best
record, Iverson talked about his relationship with Brown.</LD>
<TE>   "I was asked to leave and I left, those things happen sometimes,"
Iverson said. "But I learned from last game to get myself together
before talking. It becomes a circus."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson was critical of Brown's handling of the team after
Philadelphia's 102-91 loss to the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. Brown
declined to speak about Iverson but said, "obviously, after all
that's happened since Wednesday, this was a huge win."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson offered no apology for comments on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't lie about anything, all I did was speak my mind," said
Iverson, who has sparred with Brown on numerous occasions. "Sometimes
people take it the wrong way. The media thinks I'm trying to battle
my coach, that there's a war between us but I have no problem with my
coach. Sometimes I disagree with him and sometimes he disagrees with
me."</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers forced the Spurs into a season-high 20 turnovers and
held San Antonio to 39% shooting (29 of 75).</TE>
<TE>   "We should be embarrassed by our soft play," Spur Coach Gregg
Popovich said. "It was simple tonight, they were more physical than
us. They put us down 10 and we never got back in it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 102, Cleveland 100--Gary Payton made a 20-footer over
Andre Miller with 0.9 seconds left at Seattle to give the SuperSonics
their 13th consecutive victory over the Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland tied the score at 100-100 on a three-pointer by Lamond
Murray with 7.6 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Barry then inbounded the ball to Rashard Lewis, who passed
the ball to Payton, who hit the winning shot from just inside the
three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   After Payton's basket, Miller lobbed the inbounds pass to 7-footer
Chris Mihm. Mihm touched the ball, but couldn't get off a shot as
time expired.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland 92, Orlando 84--Damon Stoudamire scored 10 of his 25
points in the first quarter at Orlando, Fla., as the Trail Blazers
ended their Eastern Conference road trip with 3-1 record.</TE>
<TE>   The Blazers also got 19 points from Rasheed Wallace and 18 from
Ruben Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic had its four-game winning streak ended. Tracy McGrady
led Orlando with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 97, Chicago 90--Jalen Rose rediscovered his shooting
touch, scoring 38 points as the Pacers kept the Bulls winless on the
road (0-18) this season.</TE>
<TE>   Rose had scored only 18 points in his last three games, shooting
eight of 32 from the field. He hit six of seven in the first half and
never cooled off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 104, Detroit 90--Paul Pierce scored 16 points to offset a
poor shooting night by Antoine Walker as the Celtics won at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Walker finished with a season-low five points and saw his
consecutive streak of scoring in double figures end at 126 games.
Walker was one of 14 shooting but had 11 rebounds and seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 94, Atlanta 91--Alvin Williams scored a career-high 28
points, including a three-pointer with 1.7 seconds left in overtime,
to lead the Raptors at Toronto. Williams, whose previous best was 24
against Indiana on Dec. 19, scored seven points in overtime. Williams
also had seven assists and seven rebounds.</TE>

<HD>Bucks Roll Past Wizards</HD>
<DH>NBA: Thomas outscores Jordan, 16-2, in first quarter and
Milwaukee ends Washington's winning streak at four games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>After a 19-point loss that wasn't even competitive in the second
half, Michael Jordan summed up what was obvious to everyone who had
just witnessed it.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we're not in their class," Jordan said. "I think
they're a little better than we are right now."</LD>
<LD>   Actually, the Milwaukee Bucks looked a lot better than the
Washington Wizards.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Thomas dominated Jordan early, outscoring him, 16-2, in the
first 12 minutes, as the Bucks opened a big lead and cruised past
Washington, 105-86, Friday night, ending the Wizards' four-game
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas tied his season-high with 25 points, Ray Allen scored 27,
Sam Cassell added 18 and Anthony Mason had 12 points, 12 rebounds and
seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   "They played like the best team in the East," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan finished with 22 points, scoring 14 in the second quarter.
The Bucks used Thomas, Mason and Darvin Ham to defend Jordan, who
shot 10 for 24 and committed a season-high six turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee prevented the Wizards from matching last season's
victory total of 19.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't underestimate what we are as a team," Allen said. "We
haven't been showing that a lot, but we're a pretty good basketball
team when we're playing good basketball, and I think we took them out
of the game early."</TE>
<TE>   Washington is 0-9 when allowing 100 or more points. The Wizards
held 14 of their previous 15 opponents below 100, including 11 games
in which the opposition failed to reach 90.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks reached that number when Allen hit a three-pointer with
5:15 left, ending the Wizards' final threat as Jordan sat out the
entire fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee made 10 of 13 three-point attempts, with Allen and
Thomas making four apiece.</TE>

<LD>0-21, COMING RIGHT UP, AND OVER AND OUT</LD>
<LD>   Tampa Bay at Philadelphia, today, 1:30 p.m., Channel 7</LD>
<LD>   Subplot: Tony Dungy could be coaching his final game for Tampa Bay
if the Buccaneers lose, as expected, at Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   The St. Petersburg Times reported Friday that Buccaneer owner
Malcolm Glazer is prepared to hire Bill Parcells should Dungy fail to
reach the NFC championship game. Tampa Bay is 0-20 in games played in
weather 40 degrees or colder--in other words, game-time conditions at
the Vet today--and should the Buccaneers somehow escape Philadelphia
with a win, a trip to St. Louis awaits them. So the prospects of
Dungy posing for another team photo in Tampa Bay would appear to be
bleak.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the situation are comments made by Parcells to Sports
Illustrated last month suggesting that a third trip around the NFL
was not out of the question for the Gray Tuna.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I miss 1 o'clock on Sundays," he said. "It was my life
for a lot of years. But you can't do this forever, and guys like me
aren't for everyone. I do feel this is it for me. If I get through
January, I'll be in the clear forever."</TE>
<TE>   Funny, right about now, Dungy is thinking the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 31/2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE, EITHER</TE>
<TE>   New York Jets at Oakland, tonight, 5, Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   Subplot: Jon Gruden could be coaching his final game for Oakland
if the Raiders lose at home to the Jets, as they did last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   All is not well within Raider Nation, as the team's three-game
losing streak and 2-4 finish might suggest. Gruden said no to his
dream job at Notre Dame in November, when the Raiders were 8-2 and
thinking about an all-L.A.-ex Super Bowl against the Rams. Now, it's
early January and the oldest team in the league is showing its age
and media reports claim that Gruden had his agent look into the
University of Florida job just before the Gators got fed up with
being snubbed and turned to somebody who had no reason to say no, Ron
Zook.</TE>
<TE>   Such media reports, most likely, did not amuse owner Al Davis, who
doesn't like to lose, doesn't like the horizontal passing game Gruden
and Rich Gannon have foisted on the Lamonica/Stabler/Plunkett legend
and doesn't like coaches under contract looking to jump ship with a
playoff game at hand and the greatness of the Raiders on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden could have saved a lot of people a lot of trouble by taking
the Notre Dame job this first time around, but here we are, and there
is George O'Leary, with a newly edited resume, in Minnesota as an
assistant to Mike Tice.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 41/2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUESTION STEVE MARIUCCI MIGHT SOON WANT TO CONSIDER: JEFF GARCIA .
. . OR TONY BANKS?</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco at Green Bay, Sunday, 9:30 a.m., Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   Subplot: Steve Mariucci could be coaching his final game for San
Francisco if the 49ers lose at Green Bay, where Brett Favre is 30-0
when the temperature is 34 degrees or lower.</TE>
<TE>   (That, by the way, is one of the great stats in sports.
Thirty-four degrees. What happens to Favre when the Lambeau
thermometer hits 35? Does he go berserk, firing up interceptions like
Ty Detmer in a wind tunnel, ignoring every other play sent in from
the sideline, calling a running play in the huddle and then taking
the snap and legging it himself right into the waiting arms of
Michael Strahan? Crazy things like that?)</TE>
<TE>   Mariucci has numbers on his side--namely, a 12-4 record after
losing Jerry Rice and Charlie Garner to the other side of the
bay--but he has two old coaches, Bill Walsh and Terry Donahue,
sitting in the 49er administrative offices shaking their heads and
saying they sure wouldn't do it that way.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Washington Post, Mariucci is on the short list of
coaching candidates Redskin owner Daniel Snyder is considering, even
though Marty Schottenheimer hasn't been technically dismissed as
Redskin coach.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 31/2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DISTRACTION? WHAT DISTRACTION?</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore at Miami, Sunday, 1 p.m., Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The only wild-card game in which neither coach is coaching for his
job, which means, alas, the Baltimore media are stuck with Brian
Billick news conferences for at least a few more months.</TE>
<TE>   Billick, you must understand, is writing NFL history every time he
picks up his whistle, and he wants it chronicled for future
generations, which explains why he subjected his Super Bowl champions
to the distraction of HBO's cameras following their every move for
six weeks of summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize a lot of coaches would not have done it," Billick says,
"but it provided a great learning tool for us. I defy anyone to look
at our training camp and equate anything that happened, good or bad,
during the season to what happened during the summer."</TE>
<TE>   All right then.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, HBO's cameras captured Jamal Lewis blowing out
his knee without a decent replacement in sight, Elvis Grbac taking
snaps without Trent Dilfer in sight and Raven defensive players
carrying on like the 1976 Steelers when they were about to be
schooled by the 2001 Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   Equates to an error-riddled, 10-6 wild-card season and a potential
playoff-ending trip to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 21/2.</TE>

<LD>Quarterbacks, coaches and kickers--they are the keys to any Super
Bowl tournament. Except for the last one, which was an aberration, as
the 2001 New York Giants proved, and really something everyone would
prefer to forget.</LD>
<LD>   In deference to the figure skaters who have been engaged in their
own Ice Bowl this week in L.A., here is how the 12 teams still
standing would place on the medals podium:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   QUARTERBACKS</TE>
<TE>   Gold: Brett Favre, Green Bay. Still the man you want if you have
to win one game, on any kind of surface, in any kind of weather.
Unless, perhaps, your scouts report he plays golf with the left
defensive end on the opposing team.</TE>
<TE>   Silver: Kurt Warner, St. Louis. He's 3-1 in four postseason
starts, averaging 27.8 points a game. And it's nothing but slick
plastic grass inside climate-controlled domes from here through the
Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Bronze: Rich Gannon, Oakland. Showed his age down the stretch and
could have used the bye week that the Raiders' 0-3 finish fumbled
away. Still, he's easily the class of the AFC playoff quarterbacks
and the one man the Raiders cannot afford to lose, as last year's AFC
final reminded.</TE>
<TE>   The field: Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia went 1-1 in last
season's playoffs but won't be playing the Giants this time around.
It's not difficult to envision him carrying the Eagles past Tampa Bay
and Chicago into the NFC final.... Jeff Garcia of San Francisco is
cold weather-conditioned, having played four seasons in Calgary. But
in his biggest game of the regular season, at St. Louis on Dec. 9, he
looked like a deer staring into a stampede.... Tom Brady of New
England is the great X factor of these playoffs. No one has a clue
how he'll handle the pressure, but Drew Bledsoe took the Patriots to
a Super Bowl, and Brady beat him out.... When does Pittsburgh's
Kordell Stewart fly off the rails? In the second round? Or the AFC
final? ... Chicago's Jim Miller is this year's Trent Dilfer. Which is
more than Baltimore can say about Elvis Grbac. Brad Johnson of Tampa
Bay took the '99 Redskins to the second round. He'll be lucky to get
that far this time.... If Vinny Testaverde of the New York Jets and
Jay Fiedler of Miami can be classified as "playoff quarterbacks,"
it's time the NFL considered contracting its playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COACHES</TE>
<TE>   Gold: Mike Martz, St. Louis. Frankly, a lot of people were
wondering about him this time last season. But he's smart enough to
admit a mistake (his 2000 defense), correct it (new defensive
coordinator Lovie Smith has the NFC's top-ranked unit) and retool on
the fly.</TE>
<TE>   Silver: Brian Billick, Baltimore. Won a Super Bowl with Dilfer,
convincing himself he was indeed God's gift to coaching. But if he
were half as smart as he thinks he is, wouldn't he have thought twice
before signing Grbac and beginning training camp without a capable
backup for Jamal Lewis?</TE>
<TE>   Bronze: Bill Belichick, New England. Until 2001, his reputation as
a defensive mastermind never translated into head coaching success.
Can create a game plan with the best of them, and now he needs only
two more to reach the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The field: Bill Cowher of Pittsburgh has been to the Super Bowl
before. But if he's pinning this run on Stewart not making big
mistakes and winning it on Kris Brown field goals, he won't be
returning.... If Oakland's Jon Gruden and San Francisco's Steve
Mariucci are really the long-term answers in the Bay Area, why do
they lead the league in next-stop rumors? ... Likewise, Tony Dungy of
Tampa Bay is rumored to be headed here, there and everywhere except
the Super Bowl.... And if the Chicago Bears are truly sold on Dick
Jauron, why did it take the NFC coach of the year until December to
receive a handshake on a contract extension? ... Mike Sherman of
Green Bay is no Lombardi. But at 21-11 in his first two seasons, he's
no Phil Bengston, either.... Andy Reid doesn't have a lot of
resources in Philadelphia, but he shouldn't have struggled until the
16th week to win the flimsiest division in the league.... Herman
Edwards somehow won 10 games with a New York Jet team that has scored
only 13 more points than it has allowed. But let's see him beat the
Raiders in Oakland again.... Dave Wannstedt of Miami can get you to
the second round. But once there, he has been outscored 27-0 with the
2000 Dolphins and 44-15 with the '94 Bears.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KICKERS</TE>
<TE>   Gold: David Akers, Philadelphia. Was 26 for 31 on regular-season
field-goal attempts, and two for three from 50 yards or longer. And
when you kick for the Eagles, every field goal is a potential
game-turner.</TE>
<TE>   Silver: Matt Stover, Baltimore. For most of Baltimore's 2000 Super
Bowl run, he was the long and short of the Ravens' offense. He knows
the drill.</TE>
<TE>   Bronze: Paul Edinger, Chicago. Has the same .839 percentage as
Akers, and is 13 for 16 between 40 and 49 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The field: Adam Vinatieri has driven home a lot a field goals
through freezing winds for New England over the years, and now they
mean something.... The incredible shrinking Dolphin offense has even
swept up Olindo Mare, now a short-range specialist who's only two for
four on attempts longer than 39 yards.... Jeff Wilkins kicks a lot of
extra points for St. Louis.... John Hall of the Jets is three for six
from 50 yards or more, including last week's 53-yarder to clinch the
rematch with the Raiders.... The Raiders would be kicking back this
weekend and waiting for the second round to come to them if Sebastian
Janikowski had a personal trainer.... At Tampa Bay, they finally
found a way to calm down Martin Gramatica: pulled hamstring.... Ryan
Longwell, a good name for a field-goal man, has the misfortune of
taking many of his kicks off the tundra in Green Bay.... Jose Cortez
of San Francisco was one for one from 50 yards and out and one for
two from 19 yards and in.... For Pittsburgh's sake, the less said
about Kris Brown the better.</TE>
<TE>   And that takes us to the big prize....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TEAMS</TE>
<TE>   Gold: St. Louis Rams. They are the Lakers of professional
football, with their own Shaq-Kobe routine in Warner and Marshall
Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   Silver: Green Bay Packers. They are undefeated in postseason games
at Lambeau Field and 2-0 against the Bears this season.</TE>
<TE>   Bronze: Pittsburgh Steelers. They are flawed, but holding the home
field through the AFC side of the tournament counts for something.</TE>

his defense became a liability, he made his coordinator disappear and

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milan Hnilicka is used to facing a lot of shots. He's less accustomed
to getting much help from his defense.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta goaltender had 37 saves and Hnat Domenichelli scored a
second-period power-play goal to give the Thrashers a 1-0 victory
over the Calgary Flames on Friday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the kind of game we want to play--everybody working hard
and contributing," Hnilicka said. "That's what we are aiming for, and
it felt great to achieve it the way we did tonight."</LD>
<TE>   Hnilicka earned his second shutout this season and fourth overall.
He has faced at least 30 shots in 25 games and entered with 1,077
shots against this year, seven less than NHL leader Mike Richter of
the New York Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta, the NHL's worst team, has a two-game winning streak for
only the second time this season, the first since Oct. 26-27 and the
first in its three-year history at home after December.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary, which dropped to 3-6-2 in its last 10 games, managed only
one shot on goal after goalie Roman Turek was pulled with 1:06
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Domenichelli scored 7:53 into the second period, redirecting
Yannick Tremblay's slap shot from outside the left circle and beating
Turek's stick side.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Washington 3--Tomas Kaberle scored his second goal of
the game with 14:21 left in the third period as the Maple Leafs
earned a tie with the Capitals at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals, who have dropped four of five, played without
wingers Peter Bondra (illness) and Jaromir Jagr (groin strain). Their
status for today's game in Florida is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, Florida 2--Daniel Alfredsson had a goal and an assist
and Patrick Lalime made 23 saves as the Senators won at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredsson's 22nd goal tied the game at 1-1 in the first period.
Ottawa then bolted out to a 4-1 lead in the second period, scoring
three goals in a 4:10 span.</TE>

<DH>Pairs: Ina, Zimmerman skate difficult program to win third
straight U.S. title. Scott, Dulebohn also will go to Olympics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman smiled politely. Zimmerman raised one
fist. The celebration of a U.S. Figure Skating national pairs
championship, their third in a row, was an occasion for some
enthusiasm but not for overwhelming joy. Not now, not yet. The goal
is something. An Olympic medal.</LD>
<LD>   It was the silver medalists, Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn,
who skated last and who knew they needed a steady if not spectacular
performance to move from third to second and onto the Olympic team,
who leaped into each other's arms when their scores were posted.</LD>
<LD>   Ina and Zimmerman won their third straight U.S. title with their
technically difficult program skated to Paginini's "Variations on a
Theme." The performance wasn't clean. Zimmerman, a self-effacing
NASCAR fan from Alabama, stumbled badly on his side-by-side triple
toe jump, the same one he had fallen on in the short program.</LD>
<TE>   And Ina, a city girl from New York, put her hand on the ice as she
exited her throw triple salchow. But the Staples Center crowd was
wowed by the danger and innovation of their lifts and was
appreciative of the speed in the program.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing third were 17-year-old Stephanie Kalesavich and
24-year-old Aaron Parchem. This still-learning pair had begun the
night in second place but their lack of experience operating in such
a big moment showed almost immediately. On their second big element,
the triple salchows, Kalesavich put both hands down and Parchem
stumbled with one hand on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   They finished third, a fine performance in their second senior
nationals. But the U.S. can send only two pairs to the Olympics so
Kalesavich and Parchem settled for big smiles and a bronze medal.</TE>
<TE>   It had been a nervous week for Scott and Dulebohn. A fractured hip
had kept Dulebohn sidelined all fall. They were debuting their
competitive programs in the most tense situation--fighting for their
first Olympic berth.</TE>
<TE>   Tears were flowing before the final group of four leading pairs
skated.</TE>
<TE>   The sister-brother team of Danielle and Steve Hartsell, who were
national champions in 1999, had to pull out moments before they were
to skate. Steve Hartsell said he had suffered a groin pull during
practice Monday. The injury worsened to the point where they had to
withdraw. At last year's nationals, Steve Hartsell fell during a
practice session the day before the short program and needed 12
stitches to close a cut in his head. A year earlier Danielle fell on
a throw in practice and shattered her kneecap.</TE>
<TE>   Both Hartsells left the ice crying.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was anything I could do," Steve Hartsell said, "I mean,
I was trying everything but I was more concerned with our safety.
It's taught us a lot in trying to fight through everything but today,
if I could have fought, I would have."</TE>
<TE>   After finishing seventh at the 2001 World Championships for the
second straight year, a frustrated Ina and Zimmerman came home to do
some soul-searching. What followed were long talks and a series of
weekly lunches at a Cheesecake Factory. There was cheesecake to eat
and chatter about everything--skating gossip, personal crises and
skating strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Under the teaching of their coach, Tamara Moskvina, a respected
Russian who has an iron will and adds, as Zimmerman says, "the third
strong personality to this mix," Ina and Zimmerman had a program
Friday night with the most difficult elements and skated with by far
the greatest speed among American pairs.</TE>
<TE>   To beat either the Canadian defending world champions, Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier (who won the 2001 Grand Prix), or the Russian
pair of Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, silver medalists at
the 2001 worlds and the 1998 Winter Olympics, would take a near
perfect program and some luck.</TE>
<TE>   But it is possible to see Ina, who was fourth at the 1998 Olympics
with former partner Jason Dungjen, and Zimmerman stepping onto the
medals podium in Salt Lake City and winning the first U.S. pairs
medal since Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard earned a bronze in 1988 at
Calgary. Since pairs skating debuted at the 1908 Olympics, the U.S.
owns only two bronze and three silver medals.</TE>

<HD>Curses, It's Junior National Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today we think jinx. The jinx of the rinks. The cracked mirror
disguised as a gold medal. The black cat hanging out in the kiss and
cry area.</LD>
<LD>   "The curse of the junior national title," says longtime figure
skating coach Evy Scotvold with a touch of trepidation. "So many
junior ladies never do anything once they move out."</LD>
<LD>   Recite the roll call of U.S. junior ladies champions. Michelle Cho
is there. Michelle Kwan isn't. Jennifer Karl, yes. Nancy Kerrigan,
no. Caroline Song? Dena Galech? Cindy Bortz? Junior champions all,
along with Sydne Vogel, who won the title in 1995, which means Tara
Lipinski didn't. Lipinski went on to the top flight of the Olympic
medals podium in 1998. Vogel tried to qualify for the senior
nationals at Staples Center this week, but failed to make it out of
sectionals.</LD>
<TE>   Go deeper down the list. Allison Oki. Kathryn Adams. Lorilee
Pritchard. Jill Frost.</TE>
<TE>   Kristi Yamaguchi? Won't find her. Nicole Bobek? Not here. Dorothy
Hamill? Debi Thomas? Peggy Fleming? Not present, not accounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Within the realm of sports, there might be worse curses. The
Bambino's, for sure. The Heisman Trophy. The cover of Sports
Illustrated. Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch swept those last two,
making SI's cover a few weeks before winning the Heisman. That
explains the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But the junior ladies title is to figure skating what an Angel
uniform is to baseball. Some, with great fortitude and force of will,
manage to rise above it--Sarah Hughes, Nolan Ryan, Jill Trenary, Tim
Salmon. The vast majority, however, are done in before they've been
handed half a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Scotvold coaches Louann Donovan, who won the 2002 junior ladies
national championship Friday. Formerly the coach of 1994 Olympic
silver medalist Kerrigan, Scotvold knows the score, is mindful of the
history.</TE>
<TE>   Has he warned Donovan, a sweet kid with a pet hedgehog named
Toepic, of the potential danger lurking ahead?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think she really needs it," Scotvold says, speaking
bravely. "She's got a lot ahead of her now internationally. I think
she'll do very well. She has to improve her maturity, her style and
polish. That's the big step she has to make. But she's got content
going solid now. What she has to do is really mature this next year.
That's what we'll focus on."</TE>
<TE>   What happens to the junior champs once they graduate to the senior
circuit?</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, they gather candles on their birthday cakes. They gain a
few inches. They add a few pounds. They acquire interests that lead
them outside the practice arena, or burn into the early a.m. hours
that once were reserved for sleep preparation for the next round of
morning axels.</TE>
<TE>   Others who stay the course aren't always equipped for the long
haul.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes a junior champion can win juniors without being a great
technical jumper," Scotvold says. "Because sometimes they don't do a
lot [of demanding jumps]. Last year, they didn't do much in terms of
technical merit.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't have it by the time they're juniors, if they're not
doing the big stuff by then, they're probably going to fall by the
wayside."</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason why Scotvold holds out hope for Donovan, who's
15 and steps up to seniors this year.</TE>
<TE>   "She's got the hard stuff," he says. "You can make them beautiful
as they get older, but once they get older you can't make them jump
anymore. You got to get that in early, while they're still little
tomboys."</TE>
<TE>   A few other reasons: Hughes, the 1998 junior national champion, is
third heading into today's senior women's free skate. Ann Patrice
McDonough, the 2000 junior winner, is fifth. Two former junior
titlists, skating in the same final group as Kwan and Sasha Cohen. A
ray of hope.</TE>
<TE>   Scotvold has studied the senior field this week. Were Donovan
entered there instead, Scotvold believes "she'd certainly be in the
top 10 right now. Maybe higher. At least technically. Technically,
she'd probably even be higher than that. But style-wise, she doesn't
have the maturity yet."</TE>
<TE>   There's still much to learn. Little things. Like
fashion-coordinating to get the home crowd on your side. Kwan did
this during Thursday's short program, donning Laker purple. The
Staples audience gave her a standing ovation when she was finished.
Hughes skated out in black and purple, King colors. Another standing
ovation.</TE>
<TE>   It looks daunting, no doubt. Donovan blushed and shrugged shyly
when asked Friday evening about the future, her future.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," she answered. "As long as I keep skating well, I
think I'll keep improving. I move up to seniors next year. It's a big
step."</TE>
<TE>   A reporter asked if she planned to take a shot at the 2006
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   More blushing. More shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   That's what they all say, when they are transfixed by the glitter
of newly minted gold. But maybe Louann will be one of the few to go
against the grain, to break on through to the other side. To finally
sink the jinx of the rinks.</TE>

<LD>Drew Gibson, the son of Dorsey High boys' basketball Coach Kevin
Gibson, doesn't hear too many compliments from his demanding father,
but he sensed a sign of satisfaction after scoring a career-high 30
points in the Dons' 75-70 upset victory over No. 2-ranked Fremont in
a Coliseum League game Friday at Dorsey.</LD>
<LD>   "You could see it on his face that he knew I played a good game,"
Drew said. "He doesn't have to say anything."</LD>
<LD>   Gibson, a junior guard, scored seven consecutive points in the
fourth quarter when Dorsey (10-4, 2-0 in league) overcame a 10-point
deficit. The Dons used a ferocious half-court trapping defense that
rattled Fremont (14-2, 1-1).</LD>
<TE>   The Pathfinders had beaten Dorsey by 10 points earlier this season
in a tournament game. Donald Wilson added 22 points for Dorsey, which
upset No. 13 Crenshaw on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had the capabilities of being a pretty good team,"
Kevin Gibson said.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont's only loss this season had come to a team from New York.
Terrell Powell scored 21 points to lead the Pathfinders, who were
unable to find a dependable ballhandler to counter the Dons'
aggressive trapping defense.</TE>

<DH>Soccer: Monarchs can't hold lead against No. 8 Santa
Margarita as Eagles score with two minutes left for 1-1 tie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Margarita and Santa Ana Mater Dei highs battled to a 1-1 tie in
a Serra League boys' soccer game Friday, but afterward the reactions
from the players and coaches of each team were quite different.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Curt Bauer of visiting Santa Margarita felt fortunate to
avoid a loss after his team tied the score on Christian Hanson's goal
with two minutes to play.</LD>
<LD>   Forward Randy Poggio of Mater Dei (15-2-4, 0-0-2 in league) was
disappointed that the Monarchs' upset bid fell short after his 20th
goal of the season gave them a 1-0 lead with seven minutes remaining.</LD>
<TE>   "They picked it up after we scored," Poggio said. "I think we got
a little complacent and we weren't ready for them."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita (16-2-3, 1-0-1), ranked No. 8 in the region by The
Times, controlled the pace of the game for the first 25 minutes of
the second half.</TE>
<TE>   But the San Jose State-bound Poggio began to get some high-quality
shots on goal after that for the defending Southern Section Division
II champions.</TE>
<TE>   He had a header that was wide right with 14 minutes left in the
game and his left-footed shot was wide right again, two minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   His goal came five minutes after that when he headed the ball into
the lower right-hand corner of the net off a crossing pass from Dee
Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita, the two-time defending league champion, played
with a sense of urgency after that.</TE>
<TE>   Tannen Wells had a point-blank shot that was blocked by UCLA-bound
goalkeeper Nate Pena with six minutes left in the game, but Pena was
unable to stop Hanson's header off a crossing pass from Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "They should play every minute like it's their last," Bauer said,
"but they don't until they get behind."</TE>

<LD>Pepperdine's tough defense, which held St. Mary's to 26% field-goal
shooting, propelled the Waves to a 67-51 victory Friday night at
Moraga.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves (8-6, 1-0) got double-figure scoring from five players
and forced the host Gaels (5-9, 0-1) to make only 16 of 62 field goal
attempts.</LD>
<LD>   Forward Jimmy Miggins had 11 points and 13 rebounds for
Pepperdine, which shot 46% (21 of 46) from the field. The Waves also
got 11 points from guard Terrance Johnson. Devin Montgomery, Boomer
Brazzle and Craig Lewis each scored 10.</LD>
<TE>   St. Mary's, led by forward Chase Poole's 12 points and eight
rebounds, trailed throughout the game but pulled to within 40-36 on a
layup by Poole with 11:38 remaining. However, the Gaels could manage
only one field goal and two free throws during the last five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine was efficient at the free throw line, making 22 of 27
(82%). St. Mary's made 15 of 22 free throws (68%).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 75, Loyola Marymount 66--Darrell Tucker had 20
points and 14 rebounds to post his seventh double-double and lead the
host Dons at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Shamell Stallworth scored 23 points, including three three-point
baskets, to tie his season-high, and John Cox scored 14 points for
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman forward Andy Osborn led Loyola Marymount with 17 points
and seven rebounds. Kent Dennis scored 12 for the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   The Dons outscored the Lions, 22-11, over an eight-minute period
to move ahead, 64-54, on Stallworth's layup with 5:46 remaining.
Loyola Marymount closed to within 70-63 on Dennis' three-point basket
with 2:07 remaining, but would get no closer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 65, Portland 64--Jason Blair scored 28 points as San
Diego (9-5) held on to win at Portland. Coky Rochin had 20 points and
17 rebounds for Portland (4-11).</TE>
<TE>   After Sam Adamo's jumper put San Diego ahead 65-62, Portland had a
chance to tie when Rochin scored from close range and was fouled. But
he missed the free throw.</TE>
<TE>   After a missed shot by the Toreros, Portland had another chance
with 10 seconds remaining, but Casey Frandsen missed an eight-footer.</TE>

<HD>Identity Is No. 1 Problem</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Top-ranked Kansas plays in Westwood
today, and UCLA needs to change from the team that was pounded on the
boards against USC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA can only hope No. 1 Kansas arrived in Los Angeles soon enough to
scout the Bruins' devastating loss to USC on Thursday and file a
three-part report to Coach Roy Williams.</LD>
<LD>   * Matt Barnes is the go-to scorer, the team's only pure shooter.
He shies away from contact, though. The kid can light it up from
beyond the arc, but the way the Trojans battered him on the boards
it's obvious he has no toughness.</LD>
<LD>   * Freshmen Cedric Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson
aren't big, fat zeros. They are tall, thin zeros. It's charitable of
UCLA to have a community outreach program like this, taking kids off
the street and giving them some court time, but it sure doesn't help
the team.</LD>
<TE>   * Jason Kapono, T.J. Cummings and Billy Knight are lousy shooters.
They throw up more bricks than the third little pig. We can leave
them alone and focus on stopping that Barnes kid.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins often give misleading impressions. They are not only
chameleons. They are two-headed chameleons, capable of changing
color, mood and identity at the toss of an opening jump ball.</TE>
<TE>   So what if Barnes normally scores more points through toughness
than touch? That the freshmen have had shining moments? That Kapono,
Cummings and Knight go on frequent scoring binges?</TE>
<TE>   Who knows if any of it will be true today?</TE>
<TE>   In one game the Bruins exhibit veteran leadership and freshman
creativity, while in the next the veterans are creaky and the
freshmen clownish.</TE>
<TE>   In one game center Dan Gadzuric scores 20 points, while in the
next he grows mold sitting on the bench saddled with fouls. His only
certainty is that when called for one foul, he will foul again within
90 seconds, take a seat and stare into the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks (13-1) should not expect No. 11 UCLA (11-3) to
duplicate its spotty performance against the Trojans--Barnes scoring
34 points and making seven three-point shots, the freshmen going
scoreless, Kapono, Cummings and Knight shooting a combined 35%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to say what to expect," Barnes said. "I think we'll
play well. We usually do in big, televised games."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA and Kansas figured they'd meet first in a tiny sweltering
island gym in November. But Ball State changed those plans, beating
Kansas, then UCLA in the Maui Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas responded to the upset by winning 13 in a row, slowly
climbing the rankings until reaching the top spot when Duke was
defeated Sunday. The Jayhawks have been convincing, each victory
coming by a margin of at least seven and seven of the wins by at
least 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA responded by improving in fits and starts, beating ranked
Alabama and Georgetown decisively, losing to Pepperdine at home,
struggling to beat outmanned UC Riverside, UC Irvine and the two
Pacific 10 Conference Washington teams.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a similarity, it is in experience. The Jayhawks have
four returning starters, including what is regarded as the best
forward tandem in the nation in Drew Gooden and Nick Collison.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden, who averages 20.6 points and 12.4 rebounds, is one who got
away from UCLA. The 6-foot-9 junior from the Bay Area chose Kansas
over the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big-time thing to go to UCLA," he said. "I had them on
my list, but it just didn't work out."</TE>
<TE>   He remains impressed by UCLA Coach Steve Lavin--as a
conversationalist.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Lavin and I still have a decent relationship," he said. "We
talk, we could talk forever. A lot of coaches just recruit you and
kiss up to you to come to their school. But Coach Lavin, even though
I didn't come to their school, he still treats me with the same
respect and talks to me."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who is 368-90 in 13-plus seasons, is impressed by
UCLA--as a storied program.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Pauley Pavilion as a gym, but when you look at the banners
in that building--and I appreciate history and traditions--I get cold
chills," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin might be in a cold sweat after watching his team against
USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Our challenge is to be sure we don't get beat twice in a week,"
he said. "This is a huge game for us."</TE>
<TE>   A loss would mean a fall to the fringe of the national rankings. A
victory would effectively erase the loss to the Trojans (except in
the conference standings) and reaffirm the Bruins as a dangerous team
capable of beating anyone on a given day.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going up against No. 1," Barnes said. "We know that."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has done reasonably well against top-ranked opponents in
recent years, beating Stanford in two of three games when the
Cardinal was No. 1 and losing to Duke by 13 points in last year's
regional semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas was ranked No. 1 in 1996 during a 96-83 early season win
over UCLA. But current players remember last season's opener, a 99-98
Jayhawk victory in the Coaches for Cancer Classic.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks jumped to a 16-2 lead, which has become a trend. They
led, 28-6, in their most recent game, a 96-57 blowout of Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to keep them from running us out of the gym early,"
Lavin said. "That's my fear. If we stay close, maybe we can find a
way to win the way we have in other games."</TE>
<TE>   That's the Bruin game plan in a nutshell: Hang tight.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Kansas scouting report, it can be just as short and to
the point: Don't believe your eyes.</TE>

<TE>   Records--No. 11 UCLA 11-3, Kansas 13-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Bruins came out of the rough-and-tumble game against
USC on Thursday without significant injury, although forward Matt
Barnes has a slight ankle sprain. UCLA needs to improve its
rebounding. The Trojans held a 46-33 advantage on the boards,
including 24 on the offensive end. Only center Dan Gadzuric, who had
a season-high 16, rebounded well for the Bruins. Kansas is another
physical opponent. Although the Jayhawks lack a true center, forwards
Drew Gooden and Nick Collison are tough on the low post and give the
Jayhawks the edge with their well-rounded games. Guards Jeff Boschee
and Kirk Hinrich are experienced and freshman guard Aaron Miles is a
playmaker. Coach Roy Williams is 3-1 against UCLA.</TE>

<LD>USC had the day off Friday, but that didn't mean the Trojans were
resting on their laurels after beating No. 11 UCLA, 81-77, on
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-2 Trojans, who are 5-0 in Pacific 10 Conference play and
clamoring for a return to the national rankings, were already looking
forward to next Thursday's game at No. 20 Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   "This isn't the biggest win of the season," USC forward Sam Clancy
said of beating the Bruins. "We've still got some big games."</LD>
<TE>   The senior said there's no chance the Trojans would go flat after
such a draining victory, especially not with a week between games.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so, not with our team," Clancy said. "We know where
we are and what's at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Being 5-0 means nothing. We've still got a long ways to go....
[The break between games] gives us time to [recuperate] from such an
emotional game."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, USC has not won at Arizona since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the clock ran down and the horn sounded to end Thursday night's
game at the Forum, Trojan guard Desmon Farmer and his old-school
headband were in mid-flight, heading toward the basket. The sophomore
had the ball in his outstretched left hand, his right hand tucked
behind his head with his elbow sticking out.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer said he had no name for his impromptu move.</TE>
<TE>   "I just did it for the flashiness," he said. "I wish I could have
finished it [with a basket] but the time ran out so I just flipped
the ball up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior point guard Brandon Granville, who took two blows to the
head and experienced blurred vision against the Bruins, was fine
Friday, according to trainer Thomas Mallete.</TE>
<TE>   Granville, who went to the bench with 9:09 left, then returned to
the court with 1:49 to play, made five of six free throws down the
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adding fuel to the fire: As the UCLA pep band played the school
fight song and the Bruin players took the court for pregame warmups,
USC football Coach Pete Carroll toted the Victory Bell to midcourt.
Over the din of the Bruin faithful, Carroll addressed the partisan
USC crowd before tolling the bell to observe the Trojans' 27-0
victory over UCLA at the Coliseum in November.</TE>

<LD>Paul Wylie, a five-time medalist at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships and a silver medalist at the 1992 Olympic Games,
analyzes this week's championships at Staples Center for The Times,
as told to Senior Assistant Sports Editor Randy Harvey.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   I competed at the same time as Kristi Yamaguchi, Tonya Harding and
Nancy Kerrigan, who finished 1-2-3 in the 1991 World Championships.
They were at the head of the deepest field of U.S. female figure
skaters in history.</LD>
<TE>   Until now.</TE>
<TE>   The richness of this year's talent pool is unprecedented because
of the number of outstanding young skaters below the top three.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Patrice McDonough, Jennifer Kirk, Beatrisa Liang skated
beautiful and technically clean short programs Thursday. They
probably will not make the U.S. team for next month's Winter Olympics
in Salt Lake City. But, with their poise and technical prowess, we
might see them four years from now in Turin, Italy. One thing for
sure, we can look forward to years of incredible performances from
the U.S. women.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Salt Lake City Games, tonight's battle in the long
program for the three women's berths on the U.S. team will be fierce.
That is especially true of the third berth. Look for Michelle Kwan
and Sarah Hughes in Salt Lake City. The question is whether they will
be joined by Sasha Cohen or Angela Nikodinov.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan, the leader after the short program, has handled
herself admirably amid controversy surrounding her decision to
compete without a coach.</TE>
<TE>   In a conservative sport that might not condone such an independent
spirit, she made a decision that she felt was right and stuck with
it. We all should respect that she pulled off her short program
without any signs of emotional wear and tear. That bodes well for her
long program.</TE>
<TE>   My concern for her once she arrives in Salt Lake City is what kind
of message she is sending by repeating her Rachmaninov short program.
Although she's comfortable with her program from four years ago in
Nagano, and she performs it beautifully, the judges expect something
new, something decidedly "2002."</TE>
<TE>   Our expectation of Kwan is the same as for a fashion house. They
must come out with something fresh and innovative instead of
repeating an earlier line. She's the same go-to woman she always was
technically. But she needs to be on the cutting edge stylistically
too.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kwan is the reigning world champion, Sarah Hughes has
quickly developed a following among the judging community, especially
internationally. She could be a threat, not just to Kwan but also to
the top Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was third in the short program. But watch her tonight as
she shows the strength of her long program, where she can demonstrate
the consistency of her varied arsenal of triple jumps. In the past
year, she also has matured artistically.</TE>
<TE>   Now for Cohen and Nikodinov. One skater with incredible talent is
not going to make the Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   I'm so happy to see Cohen back. Her return to contention with a
second-place short program created an electricity inside Staples
Center that was palpable.</TE>
<TE>   No one performs a spiral with the extension that she does. She has
a star quality that has to make the Russians and perhaps even Kwan
very nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov, fourth after the short program, had an epiphany at last
year's nationals, where she rewrote her skating career and unveiled
her more balletic style. If she can recreate that magic tonight, she
will make it difficult for the judges to leave her off the team.</TE>

<HD>Singapore Says Terror Ring Planned Attacks on Americans</HD>
<DH>Asia: Group broken up last month had Al Qaeda training, officials
allege. Video details plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia
</DL>
<LD>A terrorist network broken up in Singapore last month was closely
linked to Al Qaeda and had planned to attack U.S. military and business
targets in the island state, Singapore's government said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The clandestine organization, which called itself Jemaah Islamiah, had
been operating in Singapore for years, the government said, and many of
its members had traveled to Afghanistan for weapons training in camps run
by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<LD>   Although some connections to Al Qaeda have turned up in Southeast Asia
as authorities investigate the terrorism network in the wake of the Sept.
11 attacks, the arrests in Singapore provide the most comprehensive look
yet at an alleged Al Qaeda plot in the region.</LD>
<TE>   A detailed plan to attack U.S. service members traveling by shuttle
bus in Singapore was found in Afghanistan on Dec. 14 in the rubble of an
Al Qaeda leader's house, according to a Singaporean government statement.</TE>
<TE>   Also found in Afghanistan was a videotape showing potential targets in
Singapore and explaining the possible use of bicycles to deliver
explosives. The tape was narrated by Hashim bin Abas, one of the suspects
in custody in Singapore, and was broadcast Friday night on Singaporean
television.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the same type of boxes which we intend to use," Bin Abas
says as boxes sitting on top of bicycles are shown. "It will not be
suspicious to have a motorcycle or bicycle there."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged leader of one cell was identified as Khalim bin Jaffar, a
39-year-old printer. He also was among the 13 people arrested. All have
been ordered held without trial for at least two years under Singapore's
strict Internal Security Act. Another suspected cell member who left
Singapore in October was arrested in Afghanistan in November by
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance forces.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the Jemaah Islamiah cells in Singapore were
home-grown. All the alleged members attended Singaporean schools. Six had
served in Singapore's armed forces. Most were quietly recruited through
classes on Islam taught by one of the group's members.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of a terrorist group in the prosperous nation of 4
million came as a shock to many, particularly because Singapore's
government is one of the most authoritarian in the region. Singapore may
be best known for banning chewing gum; it also limits free speech and
political opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its rigid controls, Singapore would make a good staging area
for an attack on U.S. interests. The two countries are close allies. The
U.S. military has a significant presence in the country, and many U.S.
companies also have offices in Singapore. About 15% of the population is
Muslim, providing Islamic militants with a community in which to operate.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. officials praised Singapore's actions. "I think
that the government of Singapore has acted with dispatch, and we're very
pleased that they've been able to do what they've done," Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the
videotape seized in Afghanistan was not the first indication of threats
against U.S. targets in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>Group Reportedly Part of Regional Network</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear how police learned of the existence of Jemaah
Islamiah. However, authorities say the group is part of a regional
network with links to Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. All three
are countries where Al Qaeda is reported to be active, and where there
are Islamists who favor creating Muslim states.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities said the overall leader of Jemaah Islamiah is
an Indonesian religious teacher who goes by the name of Hambali.
Malaysian authorities say he is wanted in that country on charges of
heading a terrorist group known as the Kumpulan Militan Malaysia.
Singaporean authorities said Hambali is also wanted in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last seven months, authorities in Malaysia have arrested 38
suspected terrorists allegedly connected with the Kumpulan Militan
Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that about
50 Malaysians were part of organizations linked to Al Qaeda and Bin
Laden, including those already arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "What we know is these people admitted they were trained in
Afghanistan by the Taliban and by the group of Osama bin Laden," Mahathir
told reporters in Kuala Lumpur, the capital. "As far as we know, their
intentions are very bad, namely to create trouble and to try and
overthrow the government by terrorist means."</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities said Jemaah Islamiah had no apparent
connection with local Muslim groups. The organization was divided into
cells to keep its operations secret, and three cells have been discovered
so far.</TE>
<TE>   "The group appeared to have generally kept away from mainstream
organizations and their activities," Singaporean authorities said. "They
maintained tight operational secrecy, using code names and code words for
communication."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of the three cells began looking for targets as early 1997
and conducted surveillance of places in Singapore frequented by
Americans, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. defense officials said the suspected terrorists appeared to want
to target American sailors and the 17,000 Americans living in Singapore.
In addition to a Navy logistics unit based on the island, U.S. carriers
and other vessels stop to be refueled in Singapore at a naval facility
built especially for them. The logistics base has a permanent American
staff of about 100.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities said Khalim, the alleged leader of the cell,
briefed Al Qaeda leaders on the plan to blow up a bus carrying U.S.
military personnel when he went to Afghanistan for training between
August 1999 and April 2000. It was for this plan that the video was made.</TE>
<TE>   But for reasons that are unclear, the government said, Al Qaeda
leaders chose not to have the cell carry out the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The cell also allegedly developed a plan to attack U.S. Navy vessels
off Singapore's northeastern coast. Police found a map among Khalim's
possessions marking observation posts on shore and a "kill zone" in the
water.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities discovered that Khalim had a list of more than 200 U.S.
companies in Singapore. Three of them were highlighted as potential
targets, authorities said, but they did not identify them.</TE>
<TE>Surveillance Targeted Air Base and Embassies</TE>
<TE>   The second cell was developing a plan to attack U.S. military planes
at Singapore's Paya Lebar air base, officials said. One member took more
than 50 photos of the base--where about 30 U.S. Air Force trainers
work--and airplanes there, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In September or October, unidentified foreigners using the code names
"Sammy" and "Mike" made contact with the cell. Together they conducted
surveillance of the U.S. and Israeli embassies, British and Australian
government offices and buildings where American companies are based. They
also videotaped the locations, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The foreigners enlisted members of the cell in efforts to acquire 17
tons of ammonium nitrate to make truck bombs, the government said, adding
that they apparently had already collected 4 tons in Malaysia. The
suspected terrorist cells were broken up before the plan could be carried
out.</TE>
<TE>   The third cell was formed after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United
States. It began conducting preliminary surveillance of potential
targets, including U.S. companies, but stopped when the first arrests
were made in early December.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 13 arrested, at least eight are suspected of having received
weapons training at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan beginning as early as
1991, the government said. The training included how to shoot a
Kalashnikov assault rifle, fire a mortar and make bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Two suspects arrested with the 13 others were later released. The two
had contributed funds to Muslim separatists in the Philippines but did
not belong to Jemaah Islamiah, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "Investigations are continuing," the government said. "Several suspect
operations cell members have fled the country and efforts are being made,
in cooperation with the authorities of neighboring countries, to locate
them."</TE>

<KH>THE ENRON INQUIRY</KH>
<KH>NEWS ANALYSIS</KH>
<HD>A Question of Balance on Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Enron Corp. scandal is approaching a stage where questions
about the investigative process may threaten the White House as much as
revelations about its substantive dealings with the bankrupt energy
giant.</LD>
<LD>   In the next several days, the most pointed questions confronting the
administration may not be whether officials provided favored treatment
for Enron as it slid toward ruin. Instead, the White House is likely to
be pressed about whether it is providing enough information to the
public--and whether the Justice Department can be trusted to perform an
unbiased investigation into the company's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Like the Clinton administration before it, the Bush White House may
soon learn that Washington investigations tend to feed on themselves,
generating a sustained stream of controversies about the inquiry
itself--with or without evidence of underlying wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   "The average person out there believes two things: politicians are
corrupt and hiding things; and where there is smoke, there is fire," said
University of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato, author of a
book about Washington scandals. "The questions being raised today are the
smoke. You don't need fire to do damage to the administration."</TE>
<TE>   The smoke grew thicker Friday, when some government reform
advocates--citing the dense web of connections between the administration
and Enron--issued the first calls for the Justice Department to appoint
an outside counsel to manage the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "This company . . . is inextricably tied to the president and top
officials in this administration. And therefore, for public credibility .
. . there ought to be an outside counsel," said Fred Wertheimer,
president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan group.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Charles Lewis, executive director of the nonpartisan Center
for Public Integrity, said, "Having watched the independent counsels and
all the special counsels that have been named over the years, this is a
classic situation . . . where you would do something like that. So the
stars are lined up to necessitate consideration of this."</TE>
<TE>   Congress let the law establishing the independent counsel's office
expire in the backlash against Kenneth W. Starr's inquiry into President
Clinton. But Lewis and Wertheimer note that the Justice Department still
has the authority to name an outside counsel to conduct the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "When the independent counsel law was not renewed, one of the
arguments was that the Justice Department could bring in an outside
counsel when it needs one. It needs one," Wertheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials say they see no need for an outside counsel.
"What you have is a situation where the administration is on a
multi-front effort leading the investigation, through the Department of
Justice and the Department of Labor," White House spokeswoman Claire
Buchan said.</TE>
<TE>   Political strategists in both parties believe that a sustained focus
on Enron's collapse will likely hurt the administration at least
somewhat, even if no evidence emerges that officials provided the company
any favors.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer demands of responding to the overlapping
investigations--several congressional committees also are probing the
company's failure--create distracting burdens on staff members. One GOP
lobbyist said Friday he was fielding questions from White House aides
wondering if they needed to retain lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Said one former Clinton White House aide: "As somebody who lived
through this, I would not underestimate the drain on a White House when
you spend your whole day running around trying to find a phone message
that [Enron Chairman and Chief Executive] Ken Lay left for [Vice
President] Dick Cheney eight months ago."</TE>
<TE>   More significantly, operatives in both parties believe that the close
ties between Enron and Bush--the company has been among the most generous
financial contributors to his campaigns--may again expose the president
to charges prevalent before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks: that he is
too sympathetic to corporate interests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be very useful to Democrats in 2002 and maybe even
2004, because . . . I can't think of an administration as close to
corporate and energy interests as this Bush administration," Sabato said.
"And you have that powerful image, that powerful populist image, of the
greedy big boys versus the little guys who get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond this broader political threat, the White House faces the
day-to-day challenge of responding to the overlapping inquiries. In the
days ahead, demands from the press and Congress for a full accounting of
all administration contacts with Enron officials are likely to intensify
after the revelations this week that Lay spoke with Commerce Secretary
Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill weeks before the firm's
Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing. Both officials said they did nothing to aid
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said Friday it is not seeking to compile a
comprehensive list of administration contacts with Enron. But it said it
was encouraging individual departments to respond to such requests from
the media as they arise.</TE>
<TE>   If the administration holds to its opposition to an outside counsel or
refuses to provide full details about the substance of its Enron
contacts, it could face days, if not weeks, of media debate about whether
it is fully cooperating with the various investigations.</TE>
<TE>   But after watching Clinton's death-match struggles with independent
counsels, no president is likely to be inclined to accept demands for
such an investigation. "Everybody who watched Clinton knows you do not go
down that slippery slope lightly," one high-ranking GOP strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also face difficult choices about how aggressively to
pressure the administration concerning Enron. On the one hand, many may
be reluctant to be seen as hectoring a popular commander in chief during
a time of military action.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, because so many congressional Republicans
repeatedly agitated for independent counsels under Clinton, Democrats may
feel entirely justified to call for one in a case in which so many
administration officials have business and political connections to the
company under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the leadership will be reluctant to [call for an independent
counsel]," one congressional Democratic leadership aide said. "But I
wouldn't be surprised if there are those within the party . . . who will
do it. And I don't think the leaders are going to be out there
aggressively saying, 'Don't do that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, after accusing the Republicans of politicizing the use of
special counsels under Clinton, some Democrats caution that it would look
inconsistent if they urge such an investigation against Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "If, after all the denunciations of the independent counsel statute
and the misuse of it, if we go down that road, it would be hypocritical,"
said Lanny J. Davis, a former White House lawyer for Clinton. "We have to
trust the Justice Department . . . and not create a monster [with a
special counsel]."</TE>

<HD>Father Convicted in Hockey Killing</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jurors find Thomas Junta guilty of a lesser charge in the
death of another sports dad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>In a case that has come to symbolize the perils of excessive
parental involvement in youth sports, hockey father Thomas Junta was
found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Friday in the beating death of
fellow sports dad Michael Costin.</LD>
<LD>   The 44-year-old Junta gazed down and his chin jutted out briefly as
the guilty verdict was read, following a day and a half of deliberation
by the jury of nine women and three men.</LD>
<LD>   In a crowded courtroom filled with Junta's large and loyal family, the
tension of the moment was heightened when the jury forewoman at first
offered no verdict. Three times, the court clerk requested the decision.
And Superior Court Judge Charles Grabau was forced to inquire twice, "Is
he guilty or not guilty?" Finally, the forewoman said, "Number
three--guilty," referring to the lesser charge of involuntary
manslaughter on the jury's verdict form.</LD>
<TE>   From the spectators' seating area, an anguished cry rang out from the
Junta family. One of his five sisters, Jessica, buried her head in her
hands and wept. Several of his six brothers also sobbed.</TE>
<TE>   Junta showed little emotion as he was immediately led away into state
custody.</TE>
<TE>   For the killing of Costin during a fight watched by children at a
hockey rink, Junta faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
However, state guidelines for first offenders prescribe a sentence of
three to five years. Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 25.</TE>
<TE>Defense Worried Jury Would Compromise</TE>
<TE>   As prosecutors hoped--and as the defense team feared--the involuntary
manslaughter conviction represented a middle-ground decision. The
conviction implies that Junta used excessive force but did not
necessarily intend to kill his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Though the prosecution had asked for a verdict of voluntary
manslaughter, Dist. Atty. Martha Coakley said she was satisfied with the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   But noting that as a result of the decision there were now two sets of
children with no father at home, Coakley said: "There is no joy therefore
in this resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Thomas Orlandi Jr., who had argued that Junta was not
guilty because he acted in self-defense, said in a statement that his
client was "sorry and sympathetic for the Costin family's loss and
crushed that he will be separated from both his wife and two children."</TE>
<TE>   The fatal fight occurred July 5, 2000, at Burbank Ice Arena in nearby
Reading. The three sons of Costin were on one side of a pickup hockey
game, while Junta's son, Quinlan, was on the other. All the boys were 10
to 12 years old at the time.</TE>
<TE>   When the game turned rough, Junta challenged Costin, who was
supervising on the ice in hockey gear. Their dispute spilled over into a
locker room, where a college-age hockey player separated the two men as
they traded punches.</TE>
<TE>   Junta, a truck driver who then weighed 275 pounds, left the arena but
returned. In front of a dozen children, including their own sons, the two
men fought again, this time in an open area near the rink. Several
onlookers who appeared as witnesses in the trial--among them, Quinlan
Junta--said they yelled at Junta and Costin to stop.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation was swift: a fracas that began and ended in a matter
of minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-year-old Michael Costin, a carpenter who weighed 156 pounds, was
left unconscious on a rubber mat. He died the next day of injuries so
severe that a medical expert said his head was nearly severed.</TE>
<TE>   With 35 million American children involved in organized sports, the
nationally televised case became emblematic of what youth-sports
specialists say is a growing trend of violence among parents at
children's sports events.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Coakley said Friday that "if any good can come of this, it
will be that we will not see another parent on an autopsy table as a
result of parental rage over children's sports."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the weeklong court proceedings, the Costin and Junta
families passed each other icily. During courtroom breaks, the hallways
resembled a demilitarized zone, Costins on one side and Juntas on the
other.</TE>
<TE>Difficult Encounter Goes Peacefully</TE>
<TE>   Inadvertently in the hallway on Friday, Thomas Junta found himself
face to face with Gus Costin, the father of his victim.</TE>
<TE>   The older man reached out to touch Junta's shoulder, telling him, "I
don't have any animosity toward you. I don't hate you."</TE>
<TE>   Junta, Costin said, nodded and put his hand out. As the two men shook
hands, Costin said, "I forgive you."</TE>
<TE>   Gus Costin said his grandsons have had a rough time since their
father's death. Two live with their mother--who was separated from
Michael Costin--and one is in foster care. All three have had therapy to
cope with their father's death, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Costin suggested Friday that after he is released from prison, Junta
might consider working to educate other parents about what can happen
when tempers rage out of control at children's sporting events.</TE>
<TE>   Though present earlier in the trial, Junta's son, Quinlan, and
daughter, Kendall , were absent when the verdict was returned. Orlandi
said his client spent much of the day Friday writing letters to both
children--as well as his wife, Michelle--"telling them all how much they
mean to him and thanking them for standing by him."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors, including two alternates, came out as a group after the court
was recessed and termed the verdict "a very difficult but proper
decision."</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by the dead man's children Brendan, 14, Michael, 13, Sean, 12,
and Tara, 11, a sister of Michael Costin, Mary Barbuzzi, read a statement
praising him as "a loving brother, caring son, but most of all . . . a
dedicated father."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Orlandi offered much the same assessment of his client.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Junta is not the person he has been made out to be, but in fact
is a loving father and husband" who has "spent his entire married life
driving a truck, four long days, weekly, to allow him participation in
his children's sports activities during the other three days," Orlandi
said.</TE>
<TE>   The case was an all-around tragedy, Orlandi said: "Everyone lost
here--everyone lost."</TE>

<HD>Enron Sought Cabinet's Help With Bankers</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Failing energy company called a top Treasury Department
official, the government says. Congress is looking into whether politics
may have played a role.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Struggling to avert a financial meltdown, Enron Corp. asked a top
Treasury Department official for help in securing a much-needed loan from
the company's bankers during a series of phone calls last fall,
government officials revealed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure is the strongest indication yet that Enron, one of
President Bush's biggest campaign supporters, appealed to administration
officials for specific assistance before its Dec. 2 bankruptcy, and
before the full extent of its problems were known. Treasury officials
said they declined to intervene.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to calling government officials themselves, Enron
executives received an assist from one of the company's powerful lenders,
New York-based Citigroup.</LD>
<TE>   Robert E. Rubin, head of Citigroup and a former Clinton administration
Treasury secretary, called the same Treasury Department official, Peter
Fisher, on Nov. 8 to suggest that Fisher take steps to prevent Enron's
credit rating from being downgraded, according to Treasury Department
spokeswoman Michele Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Fisher responded that he didn't think it advisable to make such a
call," Davis said. "Rubin said he thought that was a reasonable position.
Fisher made no such call."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Citigroup could not be reached for comment late Friday.
It was unclear whether Rubin was concerned about his bank's investment or
about how Enron's collapse might affect the nation's financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's disclosures heightened the debate in Washington about whether
energy giant Enron had attempted to use its political clout to ease its
financial problems or was merely consulting with government leaders
concerning issues that might have roiled financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of Enron's contacts with government officials had some members
of Congress vowing Friday to step up their investigation into whether
political relationships played any role in the government's actions in
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Since Enron's collapse, Congress, the Justice Department and
government regulators have begun looking into whether the company
illegally concealed the extent of its financial problems from its
investors and accountants. Enron's bankruptcy wiped out the retirement
savings of thousands of employees and cost investors billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles called on administration officials
to make public the details of all contacts with Enron representatives
before the company's bankruptcy filing last month.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee,
said in a letter Friday to administration officials that he wants to
determine why the administration "apparently did nothing to mitigate the
harm of the Enron bankruptcy to thousands of its employees and
shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, said the contacts between Enron and
administration officials are a "source of concern."</TE>
<TE>   "The close ties between Enron and the administration eventually have
to be a subject of inquiry," he said in a television interview. But, he
added, "it's important that we don't jump to conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the government disclosed that Enron Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, Commerce
Secretary Don Evans and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to inform
them about Enron's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Lay told Evans, Bush's former campaign manager, that Enron would
welcome any assistance he could provide in helping Enron prevent a credit
rating agency from downgrading the company's debts.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer insisted that the Enron case
would have no political ramifications for the president.</TE>
<TE>   "This dog won't hunt," he said. "The president's approach is that
people need to be helped. And this needs to be fully investigated to
determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing by Enron."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Treasury Department said that, after Lay called
O'Neill, Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Whalley followed up with six to
eight phone calls to Fisher, Treasury's undersecretary for domestic
finance, in late October and early November. On Nov. 8, Enron disclosed
that its accounting practices for five years had grossly overstated
profits, triggering its meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, at least some of the calls were made before Enron publicly
disclosed the depth of its problems.</TE>
<TE>   Whalley asked Fisher to call Enron's bankers to help secure a loan,
Davis said. Fisher is a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York who played a large role in the government bailout of hedge fund
Long Term Capital Management in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "As Enron's negotiations with its bankers for an extension of credit
neared a decision point, the president of Enron asked Undersecretary
Fisher to call the banks," Davis said. "Undersecretary Fisher inferred he
was being asked to encourage the banks to extend credit. He made no such
calls."</TE>
<TE>   Enron attorney Robert S. Bennett said the calls by Enron executives to
Bush administration officials were "perfectly appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett, a Washington attorney whose clients have included President
Clinton, acknowledged that Whalley called Fisher to talk about "what
impact Enron's difficulties would have on [financial] markets."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said Whalley didn't ask Fisher for anything but acknowledged
that Whalley remarked at one point: "If you can get these banks to lend
us money, great. But our credit isn't very good."</TE>
<TE>   "And he laughed. . . . He didn't seriously think that would happen.</TE>
<TE>   "There is almost an obligation to notify senior officials in the
government who have responsibility for those areas," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said that he spoke Thursday with Lay and that the Enron chief
had "no recollection" of asking for any specific help. But he
acknowledged that Lay did raise the example of Long Term Capital
Management, a large investment firm that was saved by a federally
orchestrated private bailout.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of the White House, other Cabinet agencies began
checking their own records and phone logs Friday for potential contacts
with Enron officials.</TE>
<TE>   At the Energy Department, an aide to Secretary Spencer Abraham said
that Abraham called Lay on Nov. 2 to ask him about the company's
financial problems. The aide called it a "very short conversation. Mr.
Lay did not ask for any help from the secretary or the department. Nor
did Secretary Abraham offer any."</TE>
<TE>   "It is not unusual for the Energy secretary to speak to an energy
company official," department spokeswoman Jeanne Lopatto said.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce Department officials thus far have not turned up any
additional phone calls from Enron or any efforts by department officials
to assist the company, according to spokesman Jim Dyke.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving as quickly as we can to find everyone in the Department
of Commerce who may have talked to the company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The department's general counsel, Ted Kassinger, who represented Enron
at a Washington law firm before joining the Bush administration, has not
been contacted by the company since taking his new post, Dyke said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, a Senate committee issued 51 subpoenas to Enron and its
auditor, the accounting firm Andersen, for documents in its investigation
of the energy giant's collapse. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of
the subcommittee on permanent investigation, added to the subpoena
request a demand for Andersen to include all documents related to the
destruction of records related to its audit of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Lieberman, plans
to hold the next series of hearings into Enron's collapse Jan. 24.</TE>

<HD>'Bad Guys' 1st to Arrive at U.S. Base</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The first clutch of 20 prisoners arrived Friday at a makeshift
prison at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, four months after the Sept.
11 attacks that touched off the U.S. war on terrorism and 27 hours after
leaving a Kandahar, Afghanistan prison.</LD>
<LD>   The first detainee limped off the Air Force C-141 Starlifter plane at
1:50 p.m. local time, bound and shackled, wearing an orange jumpsuit,
turquoise face mask and a cap with goggles. The 20 were chosen by the
threat they posed, said Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Lehnert, commander of
the joint task force responsible for the prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   "These represent the worst elements of Al Qaeda and the Taliban,"
Lehnert said. "We asked for the bad guys first."</LD>
<TE>   Several appeared to resist as they stepped into the 85-degree heat,
although Army Lt. Col. Bill Costello said they might have been
disoriented from the flight.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, members of a small media pool allowed to observe heard
shouting, but it was unclear whether it came from beneath the detainees'
face masks or from Marines barking commands. Some prisoners were briefly
pushed to their knees before being frisked. Some were ordered to remove
their shoes for inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Looming amid the vultures circling overhead was a Navy Huey helicopter
with a gunner leaning out the side. On the cactus-strewn plain below
stood about 50 heavily armed soldiers from all four U.S. military
services, many wearing Kevlar vests, helmets and face shields. One Humvee
bore a grenade launcher. Two had 50-caliber machine guns. Offshore was a
small Navy patrol boat.</TE>
<TE>   One prisoner was sedated en route, military officials said without
elaborating. Military commanders, who had studied pro-Taliban prisoner
uprisings in Pakistan and in Mazar-i-Sharif, were taking no chances, said
Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who would gnaw through hydraulic lines in the back
of a C-17 to bring it down," Myers told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld denied that the cage-like cells,
hoods and sedatives might violate international standards, as charged by
the human rights group Amnesty International.</TE>
<TE>   Lehnert, the general overseeing the prisoners, said their existence at
Guantanamo would be "humane but not comfortable." They would be free to
practice their religion and given meals consistent with their Muslim
diet, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has banned photography, arguing that the Geneva
Convention says prisoners of war must be protected "against insults and
public curiosity." A senior Defense official said the rule is generally
understood to bar governments from parading prisoners before jeering
citizens, not news photographs, but blamed Pentagon lawyers for the
strict interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Pentagon plans to use the Geneva rules as a general
guide, Rumsfeld said, the detainees would not fall under those rules
because they were not uniformed soldiers in a recognized military.
Instead, they would be treated as "unlawful combatants."</TE>
<TE>   That came as a surprise to some senior Defense officials, who said an
intense debate had been waged over whether that definition fit the
Taliban soldiers, who are Afghans. One noted that Taliban soldiers did
not attack the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just sitting in his country. We fired and he just fired back,"
the official said. "How does that make him an unlawful combatant?"</TE>
<TE>   From the ranks of these and other prisoners, U.S. intelligence
officials have culled a bonanza of information, Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Interrogations and hundreds of items seized from prisoners and their
cave and bunker hide-outs--computers, books and cell phones--are helping
to identify the fates of other senior leaders and prevent terror attacks,
Rumsfeld said in a Pentagon briefing.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape and surveillance notes found in a house in Afghanistan
revealed a plot to kill U.S. Navy sailors based in Singapore, government
officials said. Rumsfeld said prisoner interrogations had yielded the
news that two senior Taliban leaders had been killed in bombing before
the end of December.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, American warplanes continued to strike caves and
tunnels in the Zhawar Kili al Badr area south of Kabul, the capital, as
they have for the last several days, and the number of U.S. prisoners
rose to 445. Defense officials would not say how many would be moved to
Guantanamo or how soon, but Lehnert said he expected "periodic
shipments."</TE>
<TE>   There were reports that seven Taliban officials, including senior
leaders, were allowed to negotiate their freedom rather than be
imprisoned, but Rumsfeld said he had not been able to verify the
accounts. Conflicting versions of the incident also circulated in Kabul.
Afghan officials told Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Joseph R. Biden
Jr. (D-Del.), who is touring the region, that six Taliban were involved
in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Biden, in a telephone interview, said he also was told that the six
had not actually been in custody, but were seeking to negotiate terms of
surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of the six, Biden said he was told, was a "real bad guy"--a
former Taliban interior minister.</TE>
<TE>   Biden said Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's interim leader, told him that
he had contacted regional and military officials to stress that the
former Taliban minister is a fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants him captured," Biden said.</TE>

<DH>A surge in evictions across the country illustrates the depth of
the economy's recession. Help is dwindling for those in trouble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>From the duplex on the west side of town, they cart out an empty
bird cage, a rusted exercise bike, a mattress, a dictionary. From the
yellow house with green trim emerges a broken dresser and some hangers.
The Victorian house with the turret yields a sofa bed, a recliner, a
table.</LD>
<LD>   On it goes, all day, every day. One home after another is emptied onto
frozen lawns, furniture and flannel shirts piled helter-skelter at the
curb. Movers do the heavy lifting. Court bailiffs supervise, then post a
notice on the door: "Your property and effects were moved into the
street."</LD>
<LD>   This is the eviction circuit--and it's busier than ever.</LD>
<TE>   "Evictions reflect the conditions in society as a whole," Cleveland
Housing Court Judge Raymond Pianka likes to say. In other words, as a
recession squeezes, people lose their homes.</TE>
<TE>   This recession has begun to squeeze hard.</TE>
<TE>   Record numbers of homeless people are seeking emergency shelter in
Boston, New York, Milwaukee and other cities gripped by winter cold. In
Cleveland, evictions have surged to an all-time high. In Las Vegas, only
charity has kept thousands of laid-off casino workers in their homes. The
constable there who handles evictions fears a crush of new cases this
month as the handouts dwindle.</TE>
<TE>   In city after city, social workers and tenant advocates report frantic
calls from the newly jobless, desperate to get out of leases they no
longer can afford. Pleas for food, for help paying utility bills and,
above all, for shelter are soaring. The Catholic Charities basic-needs
hotline here logged 82% more calls in 2001 than the year before. Nearly
three-quarters were from people with housing emergencies--some of them
still employed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to see some people who never dreamed of being homeless,
homeless or living in their cars. Or desperate," said J. Thomas Mullen,
president of Catholic Charities for the Cleveland diocese.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Etchison is one. She's 51 and single, lives alone and, for the
last five years, has cleaned rooms in a downtown Cleveland hotel. She'd
worked her way up to earning $8 an hour, plus benefits. She was in
control. Then came Sept. 11. The hotel's business collapsed. Etchison was
laid off.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to get unemployment benefits. But the bureaucracy has been
maddeningly slow. To buy groceries, she has sold her belongings,
everything she can spare. The video "Wild Wild West" brought in $3 the
other day, enough for a few meals of macaroni and cheese. Not enough,
however, to pay her rent, $115 due every two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   So Etchison stood before Magistrate Ruben E. Pope III one recent
morning in the Cleveland Justice Center, Courtroom 3A. The landlord
presented his case. Etchison, her voice barely a whisper, affirmed that
she had not paid the rent since Nov. 26. She admitted she could not pay
it now.</TE>
<TE>   "You have 10 days to vacate the premises," the magistrate said.</TE>
<TE>   Etchison stood there a moment, face taut, then left the courtroom. It
was packed with other landlords, other tenants; they filled every bench
and lined the sides of the room, jostling their baby strollers or leaning
on their canes, gripping folders crammed with the rumpled records of
their despair.</TE>
<TE>   Etchison walked past them. Her eyes were beyond tears, clouded with
shock. She took a breath. She planned her next move. "I'm going to have
to get a lot of quarters," she decided. "I'm going to have to call a lot
of shelters." The tears surged back and her voice again dropped to a
ragged whisper. "I don't know what else I can do."</TE>
<TE>   Her desperation echoes loud these days. Any number of statistics can
track it.</TE>
<TE>   There's the national unemployment rate, which stood in December at
5.8%, the highest in nearly seven years.</TE>
<TE>   There are the swelling counts of homeless people in nearly every urban
area--a record 29,800 in New York City alone, more than half of them
children. Shelters everywhere are overflowing, their directors setting
cots in the hallways and mats on the floor and still turning people away.
A recent survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found a huge jump in the
need for shelter in two dozen major cities. Requests for shelter beds
this winter were up 26% in Trenton, N.J., 25% in Kansas City, Mo., 20% in
Denver and New Orleans. Los Angeles showed a 6% increase in requests for
emergency shelter.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, the crisis is so acute that officials have taken to putting
up the homeless in suburban hotels, 30 miles from downtown, because there
is no more space in the city--save the streets. In Minneapolis, several
shelter directors hold nightly lotteries to determine who will get bunks.</TE>
<TE>   In Cleveland, the last-resort shelter for families is so crowded that
guests are allowed to bring only one trash bag of belongings. Even then,
the thin floor mats are packed so tight that there's barely an inch of
space between them. That means there's no room for 8-year-old Jada Gray
to escape the fights that break out too often. Jada tells of split lips,
of wild cussing. "It's real, real, real loud," she said. Her brother,
12-year-old Rashawn, shrugs. "We just pretend it's music," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Telling too is the surge in court-ordered evictions.</TE>
<TE>   While the number in Los Angeles has remained fairly steady, and the
bump has been minimal in other urban areas such as Seattle, court
officials in Cleveland supervised a record number of evictions last year,
up 24% over 2000. In central Florida, the recession helped drive
evictions to their highest level in years even before the full effect of
the terrorist strikes hit: up 15% through October.</TE>
<TE>   Even in cities that have seen little change in the eviction rate,
tenant advocates are noticing a shift in the tenor of calls they receive.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, crisis counselors in Austin, Texas, Chicago, Northern
California and elsewhere dealt mostly with tenants complaining about rent
hikes or facing immediate eviction. Now they are swamped with calls from
laid-off workers desperate to break their leases so they can move to
cheaper apartments or stay with relatives before their credit is stained
with a formal eviction. Many are hoping to move to other cities in search
of work.</TE>
<TE>   "They're wanting out," said Pamala Alfonso, executive director of the
Metropolitan Tenants Organization in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say this recession has hit tenants particularly hard for
several reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, rents soared during the boom years of the late '90s. As a
result, many families spent two-thirds or more of their incomes to pay
for shelter. So any reduction in their paychecks--even the end of a few
hours' overtime they used to count on--left them unable to pay the
landlord.</TE>
<TE>Welfare Payments End, Adding to the Misery</TE>
<TE>   In Cleveland, for example, the recession has knocked out thousands of
manufacturing and steel-industry jobs carrying annual salaries of $70,000
and up. Workers lucky enough to land on their feet often end up with
paychecks half what they're used to--and landlords drumming on their
doors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a broader base of people facing housing crises," Mullen
said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are stunned. They can't believe this is happening to them,"
agreed Jennifer Lainge, who works with Boston tenants facing eviction.</TE>
<TE>   The recession also has coincided with deadlines ending cash welfare
payments to tens of thousands of people across the country. Many who made
their way off welfare as the deadlines approached found jobs in the very
sectors hit hardest by this downturn, from restaurants to hotels to
retail stores. As the most recent hires, they were first to be fired. And
they have run out the clock on government aid, so there's no safety net
to catch them.</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there's Sept. 11. In Las Vegas, 15,000 hotel and
casino workers lost their jobs almost immediately as tourism plummeted.
Holding rock concerts and a golf tournament to raise money, the United
Way of Southern Nevada saved 795 families from eviction in just the first
few weeks following the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was stunning, the amount of need in the community," said Gena
Satori, a United Way spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Among the newly needy was Rene Abdulrahim, a sales administrator for a
charter airline that ferried tourists around Nevada. Two weeks after the
terrorist strikes, with the airline's business near collapse,
Abdulrahim's boss told her she would lose her job--that afternoon. Her
$30,000-a-year salary evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   Abdulrahim, 38, applied for unemployment benefits. But the caseworkers
were so deluged with claims that they told her it would be two months
before they could look at her file. In the meantime, the bills kept
coming. Phone bills, light bills, heating bills. Rent. Abdulrahim, a
single mother with two girls, scraped her bank account bare. The bills
kept coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like everything was stripped away, like I was naked," she
said. "I felt hopeless." Her voice snagged at the memory. "I felt so many
emotions I didn't even know were there."</TE>
<TE>   Suicidal with despair, Abdulrahim said, she found the United Way. The
agency hooked her up with county programs that will provide food stamps,
welfare benefits and rental assistance for the next few months. "I'm
going to make it," she now vows.</TE>
<TE>   But the aid that is keeping Abdulrahim afloat is not available
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio used to bail out families facing eviction with emergency grants.
Over the last 14 months, the program helped 7,000 families in the
Cleveland area remain in their homes. But a tight budget forced the state
to cancel the program this year. At the same time, the few charities that
offer rent relief have found their funds depleted by overwhelming demand.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing out there, absolutely nothing," said Sharon Malafa, a
social worker with the Salvation Army who hears pleas for rental aid
daily.</TE>
<TE>   Malafa can offer the poor help with their electricity bills. She can
offer a few grocery bags from the food pantry, filled with Lucky Charms
and dried soup, powdered milk and tuna. But the Salvation Army, which has
laid off some of its own staff in recent months, has no money for rental
aid--and few suggestions of who might.</TE>
<TE>   "It's heartbreaking," Malafa said. "You try to give them leads, but
you can't help people when there's nothing to help them with."</TE>
<TE>   The last stop for many is Courtroom 3A.</TE>
<TE>   It's all business here, brisk and impersonal, the bailiff calling case
after case, the magistrate ordering eviction after eviction. Landlords
willing to negotiate with tenants are sent to court mediators, whose
caseloads have doubled in the last seven months. But there are many
landlords who cannot afford patience.</TE>
<TE>   "I have bills too. I have struggles," said Misko Maslac, 62, who lost
his job as a mechanical designer last fall and now relies on rent from
his apartments for income.</TE>
<TE>   Maslac was in court to evict a tenant who had fallen three months
behind on the rent. It took just two minutes. The bailiffs set a move-out
date for mid-January. If the tenant was not gone by then, her belongings
would be hauled to the curb--another pile of sofa cushions and plastic
chairs marking another stop on the eviction circuit. These days, the
bailiffs schedule 150 such move-outs a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been quite busy," said Dave Thompson, who owns a moving company
that specializes in evictions.</TE>
<TE>   He watched as his crew cleared out an apartment full of furniture the
tenant had left behind when he vacated the premises under court order.
The air was frosty. The pile at the curb grew. The bailiff wrote up an
orange eviction notice to stick on the apartment door.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite busy," Thompson said.</TE>

<HD>Ford to Cut 35,000 Jobs, Shutter Five Factories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEARBORN, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>Attempting to reverse its sudden fall from prosperity, Ford Motor
Co. said Friday that it will cut 35,000 jobs around the world, close five
North American factories and discontinue four models, including the
storied Lincoln Continental.</LD>
<LD>   The world's second-largest auto maker hopes the draconian moves will
help it recover from myriad problems of the last year, including quality
lapses, a slide in productivity, loss of market share to its major
competitors and eroded profit. The Firestone tire recall, for example,
cost Ford billions, and its last four new models to be launched all were
recalled numerous times or delayed because of quality glitches.</LD>
<LD>   The plants to be closed beginning in 2003 are the Edison truck plant
in New Jersey, which makes Ranger pickups; the Ontario truck plant in
Canada, which produces F-series pickups; the St. Louis assembly plant,
which produces Explorer sport-utility vehicles; Cleveland Aluminum
Casting; and Vulcan Forge in Dearborn, which produces engine parts that
soon will be obsolete.</LD>
<TE>   The closings will reduce Ford's production capacity by about 900,000
vehicles, from 5.7 million to 4.8 million. The massive job cuts include
22,000 positions in North America. Of the 35,000 total cuts, about 15,000
previously had been announced.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to phasing out the luxury icon Continental, Ford said it
will discontinue the low-profit-margin Ford Escort, Mercury Cougar coupe
and Villager minivan as part of a plan to realize $9 billion in profit
improvement by the middle of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a comprehensive plan, but not a magic wand," Chief Executive
William Clay Ford Jr. told more than 300 industry analysts and
journalists in this Detroit suburb, where Ford is headquartered.</TE>
<TE>   The program "is based on executing the fundamentals of our business to
build great products. It's going to take everyone in the extended Ford
family--employees, suppliers and dealers--working together, over time, to
make it work," Ford said, standing under a huge sign that read Corporate
Revitalization Plan.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, the 44-year-old great- grandson of company founder Henry Ford
who has been chief executive for only 10 weeks, said he will forgo his
salary in 2002 and perhaps in 2003, until Ford turns around.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and President and Chief Operating Officer Nick Scheele expressed
regret at the measures taken, especially the five plant closures. In
addition, no new products have been assigned to two other plants: Ohio
Assembly, which produced the Villager and the Nissan Quest minivans, and
Cuautitlan Assembly in Mexico, which builds smaller vehicles primarily
for the Mexican market. Eleven other factories will see major downsizing
and shift reductions, and nine plants will undergo line-speed reductions
to limit output.</TE>
<TE>   Ford cannot close any U.S. factory until after the current labor
contract with the United Auto Workers ends in September 2003. The UAW was
informed before Friday's announcement but has little leverage to stop
Ford from carrying out its plans.</TE>
<TE>   The UAW issued a statement claiming credit for maintaining union jobs
in tight times.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of our contract, Ford has been required to plan its
restructuring in a way that respects the seniority rights--including job
placement rights, income, pension, health care and many other protections
of UAW-Ford members," said UAW Vice President Ron Gettelfinger.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the actions we're outlining today are difficult, they are
necessary steps to lead Ford back to a strong financial and competitive
position," Scheele said.</TE>
<TE>   First and foremost, Ford must improve its vehicle quality, Scheele
said, noting that Ford slipped to seventh place among the top seven auto
makers in initial quality, according to May's quality report by J.D.
Power &amp; Associates. He pledged to improve on that by the time the next
J.D. Power report is released.</TE>
<TE>   Ford lost $692 million in the second and third quarters of 2001 and is
expected to finish the year about a billion dollars in the red. The first
quarter of 2002 is expected to be the toughest, with subsequent quarters
showing gradual improvement, Chief Financial Officer Martin Inglis said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, in general, applauded Ford's moves.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes a lot deeper than I had expected," said Burnham Securities
auto industry analyst David Healy. "I think the long-term results, for
that reason, will probably be greater and the near-term effects are
unfavorable. The company is looking at no better than break-even for 2002
despite the $2 billion in savings.</TE>
<TE>   "Ford probably has gotten most of its bad news out of the way," Healy
said. "They've written off everything and taken provisions for everything
they can see currently to get back to a solidly profitable position in a
couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   But Saul Rubin, auto analyst with UBS Warburg, said it was just a
beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are going to have to go beyond the plans they've laid
out today. This is just stage one of what will have to be a multistage
program," Rubin said. Ford needs to do "more of the same" to reach and
sustain profitability, including additional personnel and capacity cuts,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares rose 21 cents to close at $15.50 on Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange after sinking $1.02 on Thursday in advance of the
restructuring plan.</TE>
<TE>   But two credit rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch, said
Friday that they are cutting their credit ratings on Ford and its
financing arm, Ford Credit, citing the auto maker's weak profit,
shrinking market share and deteriorating liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it will take a $4.1-billion charge against
fourth-quarter earnings. Ford also will reduce its dividend for the
second quarter in a row, from 15 cents to 10 cents, after cutting it from
30 cents in the second quarter, sell non-core assets amounting to a
billion dollars this year and work with suppliers to reduce material
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also said Friday that it will offer $2,500 rebates and continue
its interest-free loan offers on certain vehicles as it counters costly
incentives from General Motors and Chrysler Group.</TE>
<TE>   Of the four vehicles Ford is eliminating, none is a big seller, and
the company had said it will end production of the Mercury Villager and
the Ford Escort, which has been replaced by the Focus. Speculation about
the impending death of the Continental and Cougar brands began spreading
in earnest last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating model names isn't unusual. They often are retired for a
year or two, then brought back on redesigned vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougar name, for example, originated in 1967 on a Mercury version
of the Ford Mustang and remained in use through the 1997 model year. It
was resurrected in 1999 on what Mercury hoped would be a competitor in
the import-dominated sports coupe segment. But the new Cougar never
became a contender.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln retired the Continental once before, but by eliminating it
again it ends the reign of the second-oldest continuously used passenger
car model name in the U.S. auto industry. Corvette and Eldorado,
introduced on GM cars in 1953, are the oldest.</TE>
<TE>   The Continental name initially was used on a 1941 Lincoln Zephyr and
was retired in 1948 when Lincoln redesigned its entire lineup. It was
reintroduced in 1956 on the Continental Mark II and has been part of the
Lincoln line since. Perhaps the most famous Continentals were the
slab-sided models with center-opening doors made in the 1960s; President
Kennedy was riding in one when he was assassinated in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury, which loses two models, remains a moneymaker for Ford, and
Irvine-based Lincoln Mercury President Brian Kelly insists that the
marque is here to stay. Indeed, Mercury is developing a replacement for
the Villager, an all-new minivan expected to be launched in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   As if to underscore the company's commitment to Mercury, William
Ford's cousin Elena Ford was recently assigned to Irvine as group brand
manager for Mercury. "I like my cousin," Ford told The Times at lunch. "I
didn't set her up."</TE>

<HD>In Nairobi, Tax Tiff Takes Racial Turn</HD>
<DH>Kenya: Mayor of capital tells whites to pay fees or poor may take
over their land. But residents say the city is corrupt and have put the
funds in escrow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>The Zimbabwe-style seizures of white-owned farms and homes haven't
begun here--at least not yet.</LD>
<LD>   But Nairobi Mayor Dick Waweru recently warned white residents of the
city's richest neighborhoods that their homes could be invaded by slum
dwellers unless they pay outstanding land taxes.</LD>
<LD>   "It's either do or die," he told a news conference. Using the Swahili
word for whites, he added, "We must get our money by all means [or]
wazungus will have to pack up and go."</LD>
<TE>   So far, there has been no denouncement of Waweru's remarks by the
government of Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, but the mayor's attack
has rattled the nerves of white residents, who say Waweru is trying to
stir up a race war so he can fatten city coffers.</TE>
<TE>   Waweru's remarks last Saturday marked the latest volley in a running
battle involving taxation and government accountability in this capital
city.</TE>
<TE>   Angered by the poor condition of roads, the lack of garbage collection
and the absence of basic municipal services, residents of the Karen
neighborhood--named after Baroness Karen Blixen, the Danish author of
"Out of Africa"--began withholding their property taxes a few years ago
to force politicians to account for the tens of millions of dollars that
pass through City Hall each year.</TE>
<TE>   The residents received court approval to pay their taxes into an
escrow account, which they used to pave roads and provide services for
their neighborhoods. The unspent money was set aside for City Hall--but
would be handed over only if officials published audited records of how
funds were being spent.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of other rich--and poor--neighborhoods followed Karen's
example. Waweru estimated recently that the city is owed more than $110
million from "recalcitrant" boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Activists have long argued that corruption by city officials has
helped transform Nairobi from one of Africa's most promising metropolises
to one of its most neglected. Power outages and water shortages are
common. Telephones often go dead. Navigating some potholed city streets
requires a four-wheel-drive vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two months ago, a U.N. report concluded that Nairobi is one
of the most unsafe cities in the world. A third of 8,600 residents
surveyed by U.N. researchers reported being robbed by bandits wielding
machetes, axes, wooden clubs and guns.</TE>
<TE>   Many robberies are committed by off-duty police officers or bandits
who rent guns from their police comrades.</TE>
<TE>   Waweru said the city cannot provide efficient services without the
withheld funds.</TE>
<TE>   But he was dealt another blow two weeks ago when a Nairobi judge ruled
that the City Council had failed to follow the correct procedure when it
recently increased land valuations--some by as much as 3,000%.</TE>
<TE>   The motion against the valuations was filed by the We Can Do It
neighborhood coalition, headed by Jacqueline Resley, who hails from
Russell, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Resley, who runs a successful pottery business here, began urging
neighborhood groups in 1998 to take matters into their own hands by using
their taxes to improve their communities. Residents of some slum
communities have since joined upscale neighborhoods to fight city hall.</TE>
<TE>   The groups' recent court victory irked Waweru. At a news conference,
he alluded to the ongoing crisis in Zimbabwe, where President Robert
Mugabe has allowed political supporters to seize the farms of white
citizens. "We can also incite our poor people in Mathare [a slum
community] to invade those houses and subdivide those plots," Waweru
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharad Rao, an attorney who represented the neighborhood groups in the
fight against the increased land valuations, said Waweru's tactics "are
aimed at getting the residents to back down and are very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he should be trying to incite the public," said Rao,
Kenya's former top prosecutor, who is now in private practice.</TE>
<TE>   Activists said that despite Waweru's remarks, land seizures are
unlikely to occur here. In Zimbabwe, about a third of farmland is owned
by white residents. In Kenya, land reform has placed most of the land in
the hands of government supporters. Kenya's 30 million people include
about 15,000 whites, and they own less than 5% of the land, by some
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   John Githongo, who heads the local chapter of Transparency
International, an anti-corruption group, said the white-led neighborhood
associations have set an important precedent for all Kenyans--rich and
poor, black and white.</TE>
<TE>   "Successfully using the legal system to force government to account
for taxpayers' money is the greatest innovation in civil action we've
seen in Kenya," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Waweru confronted another worrisome problem. The Kenyan
government proposed a law that would require all mayors to hold a college
degree. Waweru is a high school graduate.</TE>

<HD>Floating Argentine Peso Declines by About 40%</HD>
<DH>Economy: As currency trading resumes after a three-week 'partial
banking holiday,' citizens reveal how low confidence has sunk.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Showing little confidence in their country's economic future,
Argentines drove down the value of their national currency, the peso, as
it floated on the open market for the first time Friday after a decade
when it was worth a dollar.</LD>
<LD>   The peso traded at about 1.7 to the dollar at Buenos Aires exchange
houses and banks, which reopened to currency trading following a
three-week "partial banking holiday" imposed by a government trying to
stem the flight of capital from the recession-ravaged country.</LD>
<LD>   Long lines formed outside exchange houses Friday as desperate
Argentines sought to get their hands on greenbacks. By the end of the
day, the peso had lost about 40% of its former value.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel awful, like everyone," said David Esequiel, a schoolteacher
who needed to buy dollars for a vacation in Mexico. "I have very little
hope for the future. Rates will rise. Many people are speculating."</TE>
<TE>   The administration of new President Eduardo Duhalde set the exchange
rate of the peso for government transactions at 1.4 to the dollar earlier
this month but also said it would allow the currency to float on the
market. At one point Friday, some exchange houses here were selling
dollars for 1.8 pesos, although the peso firmed slightly during the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The return of currency trading came amid a climate of tension
throughout this capital. Late Thursday and early Friday, thousands of
people took to the streets, beating pots and pans, to protest the
government's decision Thursday to freeze bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   A number of downtown banks were looted and burned early Friday as the
peaceful protests turned violent. Four people were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "The outrage of the Argentine people is total," said Juan Appes, a
merchant seaman waiting to exchange dollars for pesos so he could pay
bills. "There will be more looting, more deaths. This is nothing more
than a banana republic."</TE>
<TE>   At least 27 people died in protests and rioting last month when tens
of thousands of people took to the streets and drove Argentina's
president, Fernando de la Rua, from office.</TE>
<TE>   De la Rua imposed the banking holiday and placed limits on bank
withdrawals after depositors had withdrawn nearly $15 billion--about 20%
of the money in the banking system--since the beginning of April.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde took office Jan. 2. His spokesman said Friday that the
government shares "the pain, the anger and the need" of the most recent
protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is likely we will have more of these episodes," spokesman Eduardo
Amadeo said. "One day it will be 5,000 people protesting; another day,
300."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the administration of President Carlos Menem tied the value
of the peso to the dollar. Observing a strict monetary policy, the
government printed pesos in a quantity equivalent only to the number of
dollars it held in reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar peg began to crumble late last year as a fourth year of
recession increased the budget deficit and sent the nation's public debt
soaring to $135 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Fears of devaluation had already led many businesses to raise the
prices of many goods this week, including basic foodstuffs such as bread
and sugar.</TE>

<HD>Russia's Last Free Channel Dealt a Blow</HD>
<DH>Media: Higher court rules that the TV station is insolvent and must
be liquidated. Critics say the Kremlin is cracking down on free speech.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The only Russian television network that consistently airs
criticism of President Vladimir V. Putin lost a pivotal fight for
survival Friday when the Supreme Arbitration Court upheld a ruling that
the station is insolvent and must be liquidated.</LD>
<LD>   The decision against TV6 triggered a new outcry that the Kremlin is
prodding the judiciary to silence any media critic of nationwide reach.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just laughable to talk about an independent judicial system in
our country now," said Boris Y. Nemtsov, an opposition parliamentary
leader.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration has treated the case as a test of Russian
democracy. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told Kremlin leaders here
last month that he wanted the network's fate decided without political
interference, and to show his support for TV6, he granted the station's
general manager, Yevgeny Kiselyov, an on-air interview.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday that
"there's a strong appearance of political pressure" in the TV6 case,
resulting in "unusually rapid developments . . . at high judicial levels
where legal action usually takes months."</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's ruling, the 13 arbitration judges concurred with a lawsuit
by one of the network's minority shareholders, the Lukoil petroleum
company, which is partly owned by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Lukoil, which says the dispute is purely commercial, used an obscure
law that grants shareholders the right to dissolve a company if its net
worth falls below a certain level for two years. TV6 says its net worth
plunged in 1998 but rebounded last year, when the lawsuit was filed, and
now exceeds the legal level.</TE>
<TE>   TV6 remained on the air Friday, its 1,200 employees going about their
tasks in a state of disbelief. The ruling didn't affect its broadcast
license but set a May 26 deadline for a state-supervised liquidation.</TE>
<TE>Case Allegedly Decided Before Hearing</TE>
<TE>   "It is not clear how the liquidation will be carried out--whether the
TV screen will go black or the channel will simply change hands and be
run by a different owner," Dmitry Shtokolov, a TV6 correspondent, said in
a live report from a snowy sidewalk outside court headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Off camera, he said a court security guard had asked him before
Friday's hearing why he had bothered to come. "The case is already
decided," the guard told him.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart went numb," the 26-year-old journalist said.</TE>
<TE>   TV6 spokeswoman Tatyana Blinova said the network may challenge the
ruling in Russia's Constitutional Court on the grounds that the
arbitration judges ignored an amendment to the bankruptcy law
underpinning the case. The change, effective Jan. 1, bars minority
shareholders from initiating bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "If you measure Russian companies by the standards of this law, most
of them would perish," said Pavel Korchagin, the network's deputy
director. "The essence of this case is that we are independent from the
state and the state can never rely on our loyalty."</TE>
<TE>   TV6's dissolution would mean the silencing of two independent
broadcast voices in less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   After the state-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom wrested control of NTV
from media tycoon Vladimir A. Gusinsky in April, many of that network's
journalists moved to TV6. The journalists claim that Putin engineered the
takeover to silence the independent outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Boris A. Berezovsky, a business tycoon who owns 75% of TV6's stock,
took in the NTV team and allows Gusinsky to manage TV6 from Spain. Both
Gusinsky and Berezovsky, who rose to financial power after the Soviet
collapse and are fierce critics of Putin, have fled Russia rather than
face what they call politically inspired criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   The influx of NTV talent has helped double TV6's share of the Russian
audience, vaulting it ahead of NTV and slightly behind both state-owned
networks, ORT and RTR. General manager Kiselyov is host of television's
highest-rated program, the weekly political talk show "Itogi."</TE>
<TE>   TV6 has also profited from a popular thrice-daily series called
"Behind the Glass," Russia's first foray into reality TV, in which young
contestants living in a downtown Moscow apartment shed their clothes and
cavort before cameras.</TE>
<TE>TV6 Newscasts Took a More Subtle Approach</TE>
<TE>   But it is the network's newscasts that irritate the Kremlin. Although
NTV had openly criticized Putin's conduct of the war in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, TV6's newscasts are more cautious and subtle but
still hit home.</TE>
<TE>   Recent footage from the Black Sea city of Sochi showed residents
complaining that a snowstorm had blacked out every building in town for
three days--except a Kremlin resort where Putin skis.</TE>
<TE>   Two lower arbitration courts decided against the network last fall.
Then, surprisingly, an appeals court overruled them Dec. 29. Lukoil
appealed, prompting a lightning-fast decision by the Supreme Arbitration
Court to review the case Friday. Its open hearing lasted one hour,
followed by 70 minutes of closed-door deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   The judges gave no explanation for their "consensus" decision,
although one later told Russia's Interfax news agency that the company's
2001 financial records were not taken into account. TV6 says it turned a
$1.6-million profit last year and acquired enough assets to offset a
$22-million debt.</TE>
<TE>   "We have put the network in the black," TV6 attorney Geralina
Lyubarskaya told reporters after the ruling. "Why are we being destroyed
after doing so?"</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Lukoil's pension fund, which owns 15% of TV6's shares,
argued Friday that the shares' decline in value between 1998 and 2000
left the oil company unable to deliver a promised increase in benefits to
fund members.</TE>
<TE>   Lukoil's lawyer, Yuri Krivosheyev, acknowledged under questioning that
Berezovsky had offered to buy back the oil company's shares for $10
million, but "he's not a trustworthy businessman and we didn't take the
offer seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Krivosheyev rejected suggestions that the Kremlin pressed Lukoil and
the courts to shut down the network.</TE>

<HD>Green Campaign's Edges Turn Brown</HD>
<DH>Europe: A year after it began, Germany's effort to improve food
safety has lost its urgency and accomplished little, consumer advocates
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Black ice still encrusts the sidewalks, and it's dark by 4 p.m.,
but thoughts have turned to all things green this week as Germany's
guardians of consumer protection assess the costs and benefits of a
yearlong campaign against "mad cow" disease and other food crises.</LD>
<LD>   Even before foot-and-mouth disease added a second food scare across
Europe, mad cow fears had so engrossed Germans in early 2001 that the
government created a new "super-ministry" empowered to reform agriculture
and elevate food safety to a national security issue.</LD>
<LD>   But a year after Renate Kuenast, a lawyer and firebrand Greens
politician, was given the job of turning around a food industry long
oriented toward the concerns of producers, consumer advocates complain
that too little has been accomplished and that the wandering eye of
officialdom is now focused elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   No one is openly blaming the Sept. 11 terror attacks for diverting
resources or attention from the food safety priorities identified a year
ago. But Friday's opening of the annual International Green Week
exhibition has provoked the first serious attention in four months on the
issues that had burned in the headlines last January.</TE>
<TE>'Piecemeal' Reforms</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Green Week gathering served as a tribunal for
condemning mass-production practices and urging investment in
ecology-friendly farming. By contrast, this year's run of the 10-day
forum is providing only a quiet yardstick by which to measure the
half-steps and unfulfilled good intentions of the past year.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the new Ministry for Consumer Protection, Nutrition and
Agriculture, Kuenast has succeeded in launching a system to bestow
ecological seals of approval on food products. Those labels will begin
showing up in supermarkets in spring.</TE>
<TE>   She has also formulated new regulations on the care of egg-laying hens
and has urged European Union officials in Brussels to rethink a subsidy
system that rewards quantity over quality, hindering moves to encourage
more politically and environmentally correct farming.</TE>
<TE>   "But all these reforms have been piecemeal from the consumer's
viewpoint," Franz-Georg Rips, head of the federal Assn. of Consumer
Affairs Bureaus, said at a news conference Wednesday to kick off Green
Week, which promoters contend is the world's biggest food, agriculture
and gardening convention.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a ministry that holds consumer protection to be as important
as environmental protection and is willing to rap other agencies on the
knuckles when they disregard consumer interests," Rips said.</TE>
<TE>   No new cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the scientific term
for mad cow disease, have been discovered for months since testing of
older cows has become mandatory and feed containing meat-and-bone
meal--blamed for transmitting the disease--has been outlawed throughout
the 15-nation EU.</TE>
<TE>   But most of Kuenast's other projects remain on the drawing board. An
appeal from the consumer affairs bureaus for more detailed content
labeling on food products has been stifled by industry protests, as has a
push for expanding eco-farming to account for 20% of food production.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the share of farms prohibiting destructive chemicals and
fertilizers remains around the 2% that existed at the start of the
initiative. And nothing has yet changed in the EU subsidy system that
drives mass production.</TE>
<TE>Industry Regains Clout</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the German Farmers Assn. and the Federal Union of German
Food Industries, which fought vehemently against the efforts to expand
eco-farming, have recently recovered most of the clout they lost when
consumers were more focused on food safety.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the farmers association chief, Gerd Sonnleitner, used the
occasion of the Green Week kickoff to lash out at Kuenast and her
consumer protection lieutenants as too concerned with ecology and
indifferent toward the threat posed by her reform proposals to as many as
50,000 agriculture jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "The insecurity created is so huge that farmers are more inclined to
take their money out of agriculture altogether than invest in new
equipment and buildings," Sonnleitner complained, estimating an average
cost of 10,000 euros, or nearly $9,000, for each farmer trying to meet
new environmental protection standards.</TE>
<TE>   Germans also learned this week that unemployment has reached a
three-year high, providing a sensitive backdrop for the agro-industrial
lobbyists warning consumers that they face higher prices and more
joblessness as they go green.</TE>
<TE>   Food industry spokesman Peter Traumann was likewise flexing newly
restored muscle. Like many German industry leaders, he chastised
supermarket and retail chains that embraced the Jan. 1 introduction of
the euro common currency by slashing prices.</TE>
<TE>   German food producers enjoyed a 5.5% increase in revenue last year,
but Traumann insisted that the boost in sales has meant little profit for
the industry because of growing output costs.</TE>
<TE>   Kuenast has kept a low profile during her first year in office,
although her duties included launching the Green Week event Thursday
night with a televised stroll through the more than 1,600 exhibits from
56 countries filling 1.2 million square feet of display space.</TE>
<TE>   Her behind-the-scenes approach to reforming food production has left
her exposed to the more direct tactics of political opponents--the
conservative Christian Democratic Union, which has long been the more
trusted friend of tradespeople and farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Denouncing Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's left-of-center government as
populist and anti-agrarian, the opposition's agricultural affairs chief,
Heinrich-Wilhelm Ronsoehr, accused Kuenast of defaming German farmers by
blaming mass production of food for the mad cow and foot-and-mouth
crises.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates, however, warn that industry remains too powerful
in setting the balance between protecting prices and consumer interests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still an event for producers and sellers," said Thomas
Isenberg, head of health and nutrition affairs for the consumer
association. "There may be lots of consumers visiting the fair, but their
influence is not so apparent."</TE>

<HD>Colombians in Rebel Zone Fear for Their Safety</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Residents worry that they will be targeted as leftist
sympathizers by paramilitary forces filling a void left by the
guerrillas' departure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>This frontier town looks pretty much the same as another one just
30 miles southwest called Puerto Rico. In both places, music blares from
bars along the main drag. Pigs and cows amble through dusty streets.
People crowd into roadside stores selling saddles, machetes and sides of
beef.</LD>
<LD>   But in Puerto Rico, the mayor was killed this week. He had replaced
another mayor killed in August. Two other civil servants have been slain
since June. Dozens of other residents have been shot to death.</LD>
<LD>   San Vicente del Caguan sits in the center of a demilitarized zone that
the Colombian government ceded to leftist rebels three years ago, and has
been sheltered by a heavy guerrilla presence. Puerto Rico lies just
outside the zone and has been the scene of vicious battles between the
rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups.</LD>
<TE>   As the United Nations and international diplomats made a last-ditch
effort Friday to keep the zone intact and save Colombia's peace process,
residents here have become terrified that they may soon share the fate of
their neighbors to the southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of families have already fled, and one transit company has
doubled the number of buses leaving the zone, a Switzerland-sized region
in southern Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the rebels leave, the army will come in, and then the
paramilitaries," one 33-year-old farmer said as he sat in the town square
here Friday. "They will kill everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Fear has spread to every corner of the demilitarized zone since
Colombian President Andres Pastrana broke off talks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, this week, and gave the
rebels 48 hours to leave the protected zone.</TE>
<TE>   The army continued to send troops to surround the zone Friday as the
military prepared to invade with a force of 12,000, including members of
an elite rapid-deployment force.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. special envoy James LeMoyne arrived in the zone Friday afternoon
in sweltering heat to meet with a trio of guerrilla leaders. He has until
tonight to produce a breakthrough before Pastrana officially starts the
clock ticking on the 48-hour eviction notice.</TE>
<TE>   The impasse began after Pastrana imposed new security restrictions in
October. Accusing the FARC of abusing the zone by using it to hold
kidnapping victims and train rebels, Pastrana increased air force
overflights and military patrols and restricted the entry of foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana has said that the talks are over unless the FARC, the
country's largest rebel group, takes concrete steps toward peace. But
rebel leaders have said Pastrana must revise the restrictions before
talks can resume.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after several hours of meetings Friday, both sides sounded
optimistic and pledged to continue meeting today.</TE>
<TE>   "We can qualify today's work as valuable and constructive," said
Carlos Antonio Lozada, a FARC negotiator. "We have decided to agree to
prolong our meeting . . . in the hopes of finding a formula to save this
difficult moment that the peace process is passing through."</TE>
<TE>   LeMoyne was also optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that we will manage to make advances tomorrow. I continue
hoping that it's possible to solve this crisis," LeMoyne said after
meeting with rebel leaders Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the estimated 90,000 residents of this region of rolling
hills and riffling streams worried and waited. Life seemed to go on as
normal. The streets in San Vicente del Caguan were filled with shoppers.
Guerrillas, a common sight, could be seen walking in the town's main
shopping district, browsing a display of boomboxes.</TE>
<TE>   But many of those interviewed Friday said appearances are deceiving.</TE>
<TE>   "We are used to living with fear," said one woman, a 36-year-old nurse
who has worked in the region for 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   Paramilitary forces entered the region about 10 months ago, according
to a local human rights official. Puerto Rico, long a guerrilla
stronghold, was one of their first targets as they began killing public
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Puerto Rico Mayor Jose Rojas was killed in August. Mayor Luis Elias
Marin of nearby Cartagena del Chaira was slain in October. The new Puerto
Rico mayor, John William Lozano, 34, was cut down by six bullets as he
left his office this week.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, rumors spread that paramilitary spies had entered the
zone. That, plus the killings all around, has spread panic.</TE>
<TE>   Because the zone has been controlled by the FARC, many residents fear
that if the zone disappeared, paramilitary forces would go on a murderous
rampage, intent on punishing a population that they believe is filled
with leftist sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   San Vicente Mayor Nestor Leon Ramirez said the safety of the zone's
residents depends on the presence of officials from government and peace
groups. Military forces and armed police have been barred from entering.</TE>
<TE>   He said his phone has been ringing constantly the last few days as top
political officials and human rights workers call to express their
support. But so far, he said, the only group that has shown up is the
International Committee of the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Leon now travels outside the zone only by air, afraid to use a car
since the paramilitary forces began slaughtering public figures in
surrounding towns.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel abandoned here," he said. "They must pay attention to us."</TE>
<TE>   Although many residents had hope that the peace process will be
revived--something that has happened many times in the past--there was
also resignation. Although the paramilitary groups are violent, the
guerrillas also have committed assassinations in the zone.</TE>
<TE>   "We are simply a soccer ball between the two teams," the nurse said.
"They never asked us anything when they created the zone, and they are
not going to ask what they should do if they end the zone."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said they would be trapped if the rebels are forced to
leave the zone. They said they can't leave because of the stigma of
coming from the zone, which is considered guerrilla territory. But
staying means facing possible death at the hands of paramilitary forces.</TE>
<TE>   One distraught single mother said she wants to leave but can do
nothing because she has four young children. Another man, a government
worker, said he had stayed up until 2 a.m. discussing with his partner
whether to leave.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, they decided to stay in the hopes that the government
would rescue them.</TE>
<TE>   "I am afraid," he said, "but what can I do?"</TE>

<LD>A former administrator on the French Mediterranean island of
Corsica was convicted of ordering arson attacks that destroyed two
seaside cafes in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Bernard Bonnet, 53, was sentenced to three years in prison--two of
them suspended--after a court convicted him of destroying property by
fire and complicity. He immediately appealed the decision.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors argued that Bonnet ordered the attacks out of revenge
after having been unable to close the cafes by legal means. The cafes
reportedly were popular with nationalists who have waged a campaign of
violence for more autonomy.</LD>

<HD>Palestinians Arrest 2 Officials Over Arms Seizure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian police on Friday detained two senior Palestinian
officials suspected of trying to smuggle a boatload of arms into the Gaza
Strip, Palestinian security sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Israel called the move insufficient. Hours later, Israeli missile
boats opened fire on Palestinian naval targets in Gaza, setting a fuel
depot and a barracks on fire, Palestinian security sources said. A small
patrol boat was also hit.</LD>
<LD>   The barracks had been abandoned and there were no immediate reports of
casualties.</LD>
<TE>   The Israeli army said the missile boats also destroyed the "Jindalla,"
a cargo and fishing boat operated by the Palestinian naval police.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Israeli forces intercepted a ship carrying 50 tons of
weapons. The ship's captain said in a televised jailhouse interview that
he loaded the arms in Iran under orders from a Palestinian official and
that the weapons were destined for Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said the captain was previously commander of the
"Jindalla."</TE>
<TE>   The seizure of the weapons came after four weeks of relative calm and
again put Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has blamed Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, saying they
were behind the shipment of arms, which included rockets and antitank
missiles. The Palestinian Authority denies that.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian leadership emphasizes that it does not have any
information about the ship issue," the Palestinian Authority said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The two men detained were identified as Fuad Shubaki and Adel
Mughrabi. Israel says Shubaki is a senior official who authorized
payments for the ship and the arms. A third man, Fathi Razim, deputy
commander of the Palestinian Authority's navy, was being sought by
Palestinian security forces.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrest of certain senior members of the Palestinian Authority . .
. is an attempt by Yasser Arafat to exonerate himself," said Raanan
Gissin, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. "The real
issue is . . . dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and stopping
altogether the smuggling of illegal weapons."</TE>

<HD>Schroeder Challenger Selected</HD>
<DH>Europe: Bavaria's rightist governor is likely to focus his campaign
on German economic issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Germany's conservatives chose a state governor with a rightist
image and strong economic credentials Friday to challenge Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, ending months of wavering over their political
direction heading into September parliamentary elections.</LD>
<LD>   Edmund Stoiber, 60, is expected to campaign heavily on the stagnating
economy and stubborn unemployment, which in recent months have undermined
Schroeder's seemingly unassailable lead in the polls.</LD>
<LD>   Stoiber won the nomination after Angela Merkel, the leader of the
Christian Democratic Union, Germany's largest opposition party, withdrew
her bid, ending a two-way battle over the conservatives' direction marked
by intrigue and backbiting.</LD>
<TE>   Although Merkel was viewed as challenging Schroeder for the centrist
votes that lifted him to power in 1998, the conservatives instead looked
to their right wing for a candidate. Stoiber, leader of the
ultraconservative Christian Social Union, is known for his tough stand on
immigration and law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The CSU has governed Bavaria, a staunchly conservative, Roman Catholic
southern state, since World War II. The party operates only in the state
but campaigns together with the CDU in national elections.</TE>
<TE>   Though Schroeder's personal popularity remains high, polls
consistently show that Stoiber would be a stronger challenger than
Merkel--largely because he has presided over economic success in Bavaria.</TE>
<TE>   The state has the nation's lowest unemployment rate, and its
politicians pride themselves on having turned a rural region into a
postwar hub of information technology, auto making and engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's Social Democrats mocked the conservatives' choice,
claiming that it shifted the conservatives to the right and showed that
Merkel's attempts to reach out to new voters were at an end.</TE>

<HD>Egyptian Accused of Lying to FBI</HD>
<DH>Charges: Student had an air-band radio in a hotel room overlooking
the trade center on Sept. 11. He initially denied owning the device.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors on Friday charged an Egyptian graduate student
with lying to investigators about possessing a radio capable of
communicating with pilots while he stayed in a hotel room overlooking the
World Trade Center on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Magistrate Judge Frank Maas, citing what he said appeared to be "a
very strong case of false statements," held Abdallah Higazy, 30, without
bail in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   "There is the reality this is a very important investigation the
government is conducting, and he might have a substantial incentive to
flee," Maas said.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, he said that Higazy, a computer science student at
Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, was placed at the Millennium Hilton
Hotel by the Institute of International Education while he looked for
permanent housing.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact IIE put him in the hotel suggests this may not be a
terrorist case," Maas said.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint said Higazy, who checked into the hotel Aug. 27 and was
scheduled to leave Sept. 25, stated during an interview that he had
served in the Egyptian Air Corps and had "some expertise in
communications and communications devices."</TE>
<TE>   In court, his lawyer, Robert S. Dunn, said Higazy didn't know how the
radio got into his room. "It is not his radio," Dunn said outside the
courtroom, stressing that anything could have happened after the hotel
was evacuated during the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   However, Assistant U.S. Atty. Dan Himmelfarb told the judge Friday
that Higazy agreed during a third interview that the radio belonged to
him but told three conflicting stories about how he got it.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI affidavit said the hand-held radio, marketed for use by pilots,
was discovered by a hotel security officer who helped inventory property
that guests left behind when they fled the hotel Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy's corner room was on the 51st floor, overlooking the twin
towers, on the day they were hit by two hijacked airplanes. In early
October, the security officer entered the room and found that the safe
used by guests was locked.</TE>
<TE>   "The security officer opened the safe using an override key available
only to hotel security personnel," the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, along with Higazy's Egyptian passport, a book and other items,
was an air-band transceiver, the security officer told the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The radio can be used for air-to-air and air-to-ground communication
with someone possessing a similar radio, including the pilot of a
commercial plane. It also can be used to monitor transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers said that when Higazy arrived at the hotel to retrieve
his possessions Dec. 17, he was shown the radio by FBI agents. He stated
that he had never seen it before and that it did not belong to him. He
also said he never had visitors in his room, aside from the hotel's
housekeeping staff.</TE>
<TE>   He was then arrested as a material witness in the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned a second time, he said one of his duties in the Egyptian
Air Corps was to repair radios used by pilots to communicate with people
on the ground. He repeated he had no knowledge of the transceiver. Higazy
also said he did not give the safe's combination, which he had created,
to anyone during his stay at the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy, dressed in a blue prison uniform, sat quietly in court Friday
while his bail was argued. A U.S. marshal towered over the slight,
dark-haired defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Himmelfarb told the judge that, while Higazy was being charged with
one count of making false statements, additional charges could be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Arguing against bail, he cited Higazy's lack of community ties and
alleged: "He first denied ownership of the radio, then admitted
possession and told three different versions [of] how he got possession
of it."</TE>
<TE>   "The crime that was being investigated when the false statements were
made is perhaps the most serious in the country's history," he said. "A
radio that can be used for air-to-air and air-to-ground communication is
a significant part of that investigation.</TE>

way," he said.</TE>

and junior high school in the Washington area. He said Higazy's father
had worked for a time at the Egyptian Embassy in Washington but added no
further details.</TE>

<HD>Missiles Not Biggest Threat, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: 'Ships, trucks, airplanes and other means' are called
likely methods of conveyance for chemical, biological or nuclear attack
on U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States is more likely to be attacked in the coming
decade by terrorists with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons than by
a hostile nation firing intercontinental missiles, U.S. intelligence
agencies have concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The annual assessment of the ballistic missile threat, released this
week, highlights what Sept. 11 made abundantly clear: that "ships,
trucks, airplanes and other means" may be used to deliver--or to
become--weapons of devastating power.</LD>
<LD>   An unclassified summary of the National Intelligence Estimate says for
the first time that the United States is "more likely to be attacked with
[weapons of mass destruction] using non-missile means" than conventional
weapon systems.</LD>
<TE>   Such weapons, the report notes, are "less expensive, more reliable and
accurate, more effective for disseminating biological warfare agents . .
. and would avoid missile defenses."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the assessment appears more cautious about the development
and spread of ballistic missile systems around the world than the last
threat report, which was issued in September 1999.</TE>
<TE>   That report suggested that hostile countries were racing to build new
ballistic missile systems and that the U.S. was vulnerable to missile
attack with little or no warning. It became a key part of the debate that
led to the Bush administration's decision to push forward with a national
missile defense system.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a step away from the hyperbole of the previous
assessments," said missile proliferation expert Joseph Cirincione of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think
tank. "It's a more balanced appreciation of the threat."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official said the difference was more in tone than
substance. "There are no major changes" since the 1999 report, the
official said. "The threat remains and is growing."</TE>
<TE>   But the report--the current assessment by the CIA and 12 other
intelligence agencies--says the threat is changing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence experts do not foresee a "large increase" in the
number of nations seeking or obtaining sophisticated missiles. Rather,
they expect countries with existing missile programs to try to improve
their range, reliability and accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, before 2015, the United States is most likely to face a
ballistic missile threat from North Korea, Iran and "possibly" Iraq, as
well as from existing stockpiles in China and Russia, the report
concludes.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare sign of dissent, however, the report notes that one
agency--said to be the State Department's intelligence bureau--disagreed
about the threat from Iran, judging Tehran unlikely to field an
intercontinental ballistic missile before 2015.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the assessment warned that China could have "tens" of
missiles able to hit U.S. shores by 2015. The current report says China's
expected nuclear strike force will be "around 75 to 100."</TE>
<TE>   China currently has about 20 such missiles, the same as before. Russia
and the U.S. each have more than 4,000.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea again drew intense scrutiny. Pyongyang has extended a
voluntary moratorium on flight-testing new missiles until 2003, but the
Communist regime "may be ready" to test a multiple-stage Taepo Dong-2
missile capable of reaching U.S. shores with a nuclear weapon-size
payload, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   The report also notes that U.S. intelligence concluded in the
mid-1990s that North Korea had produced one or two nuclear weapons. A
senior CIA official first disclosed that assessment last April, but his
speech drew little notice at the time.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea also is of concern to the U.S. because it "has assumed the
role as the missile and manufacturing technology source" for many
countries, including Pakistan and Iran.</TE>

<HD>New Cockpit Door Standards Issued</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Rules call for making it harder for an intruder to enter
the flight deck by force. Critics say explosives risk was not addressed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration issued new standards Friday to
strengthen airliner cockpit doors, but some critics in the aviation
security industry complained they were insufficient.</LD>
<LD>   The FAA rules call for making doors harder to bash in or shoot open,
even at point-blank range. And the rules also call for building in
resistance to shrapnel from a grenade. But critics say the standards do
not fully address a possible attack using plastic explosives.</LD>
<LD>   Increasing cockpit security is one of the main goals of the
government's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, in which
hijackers were able to charge into the cockpits and take control of four
airliners.</LD>
<TE>   The FAA standards envision replacing temporary safeguards, such as
reinforcing bars that were installed immediately after the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Airlines will have until April 2003
to install the hardened doors on about 6,000 planes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is weak for the U.S. scenario," said Jimmy Yoh,
president of Galaxy Scientific, a New Jersey-based company that makes
products for the aviation industry, including a blast-resistant cockpit
door. "To our disappointment, there is no blast-resistance standard."</TE>
<TE>   FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette defended the standards. "The new doors
will provide an extremely high level of protection," she said. "It will
complement other security measures that will be implemented," such as
screening with additional explosives detection systems.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to making the doors stronger, the FAA rules require that
keys to the cockpit be restricted to flight crew members. Traditionally,
the senior flight attendant also has carried a key.</TE>
<TE>   Cockpit doors will have to remain locked during flight and will be
designed so they can be unlocked only from the inside. Crew rescue
procedures will be changed.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co. spokesman Jim Proulx called the standards "an important
step in the process" but said the company also is working on doors that
can stand up to a bomb blast. "We are building explosive-resistant doors.
We are trying to meet the demands that our customers are putting on us."</TE>
<TE>   Without a blast-resistant design, an attacker might still be able to
use an explosive charge around the edges of a door to blow it open, Yoh
said. "A Sept. 11 event could still take place, and I am concerned those
doors would be fully compliant with the [new] FAA requirement."</TE>
<TE>   Questions also were raised about the new requirement for making
cockpit doors more resistant to physical intrusion. Yoh said his
engineers reviewed the FAA specification and concluded that the new doors
could withstand a couple of hits by a 250-pound man but maybe not a
third.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still vulnerable to a well-trained person who pounds repeatedly
on the door," Yoh said. "We had just better hope there is a Marine Corps
guy or a Navy SEAL sitting there to intervene."</TE>
<TE>   Duquette declined to discuss the specific strength requirements for
the doors, but Yoh was not alone in his skepticism. Mike Markushewski, a
Philadelphia-area mechanical engineer, said his initial conclusion was
that the specifications are an improvement over the current doors but are
not fail-safe.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA estimated that the new doors will cost between $12,000 and
$17,000 per aircraft. The total cost to the airline industry, including
increased fuel consumption from heavier doors, could be as much as $120
million over 10 years. Some airlines, including Alaska and Jet Blue,
already are moving ahead with hardened doors.</TE>

<HD>Security Tightened Around Gov. Bush</HD>
<DH>Threat: Assassination plot against president's brother may be a
hoax, but authorities are taking all precautions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>Because of either an assassination threat or a jailhouse
hoax--authorities don't know which yet--security has been reinforced
around Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's younger brother, officials
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "These allegations could, and I emphasize could, turn out to be
without merit," James T. Moore, commissioner of the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement, said from Tallahassee, the state capital. "However, we
do not have the luxury of anything other than a complete and thorough
investigation of these allegations."</LD>
<LD>   Extra guards were posted Friday at the high-rise Capitol, where
beefed-up anti-terrorist measures, including metal detectors at the
entrances and concrete street barriers to deter car bombs, have been in
effect since Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI, Secret Service and Florida law enforcement agencies have
pooled their forces to determine whether the 48-year-old Republican
governor is indeed the target of a genuine assassination plot.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the credibility of a prison informant. Authorities say the
inmate sent a letter to Bush late last month, spelling out the threat and
naming four Middle Eastern men who he said were involved. The governor
was made aware of the letter, and Moore said that he talked with Bush
again Thursday night to update him on developments.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Miami Herald, the unidentified informant, who
reportedly is behind bars in the Fort Lauderdale area, claimed that the
men were planning to drive a truck packed with explosives to Tallahassee
and then detonate it close enough to the governor to kill him.
Information provided by the prisoner led police Thursday to a van, which
drew a reaction from bomb-sniffing dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Moore said two people also were taken into custody on immigration
charges in South Florida on Thursday in connection with the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The informant's story, however, should not be taken at face value,
officials cautioned. He has failed numerous polygraph tests, and Moore
said it is "a giant leap" to assume there is a terrorist conspiracy
against Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Bush met with President Bush on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.,
attended fund-raisers in Pennsylvania for his gubernatorial reelection
campaign Thursday and was back at work at the Capitol on Friday.
Officials in his office said that, whatever the legitimacy of the threat,
his calendar was unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this is disconcerting. But the governor has full faith in
our state's law enforcement, and he is going to let them do their job,"
said Katie Baur, Bush's director of communications, in a statement
released overnight.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier statement, Moore had said that all threats against the
governor are taken seriously and that "all necessary precautions" were
being taken.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, access to the Capitol has been restricted,
and even members of the Florida Legislature now have to carry security
cards to gain entry.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Steve Geller said the consensus in Tallahassee seemed to be
that the informant had concocted the tale to win favors or a shorter
sentence.</TE>

<HD>Somalia Assails U.S. Terror Allegations</HD>
<DH>Africa: Leader says fears of military strikes are hindering efforts

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KHARTOUM, Sudan
</DL>
<LD>The president of Somalia's transitional government said Friday that
his people had been "terrorized" by a U.S. propaganda campaign portraying
the country as a possible haven for Osama bin Laden's followers.</LD>
<LD>   President Abdiqassim Salad Hassan told Reuters television that fears
of U.S. military strikes were hindering efforts to bring peace to the
country, considered by Washington as a potential target in its war on
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "People are terrorized by this campaign of propaganda against
Somalia," the president said in an interview in the Sudanese capital,
Khartoum, where he was attending a summit.</LD>
<TE>   "People are terrorized to see the largest country in the world
threaten this poor country that has been ravaged by civil war for 10
years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States says it is gathering more intelligence on Somalia,
fearing that Islamic militants may have exploited the lack of a strong
central authority to pursue their activities far from the eyes and ears
of government.</TE>
<TE>   The Somalian president reiterated that there are no bases of the Al
Qaeda terrorist network or other extremists in his country, and he
appealed for help from Washington to stabilize his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to unite our country, and have for that the help of the
international community, so that Somalia will not be a breeding ground
for future terrorists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdiqassim said that his fledgling government had set up a committee
to combat terrorism and has arrested several suspects but that its
efforts were being hampered by a lack of resources.</TE>
<TE>   East African leaders concluding a two-day summit in Khartoum called on
Somalia to rid itself of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The summit brought together Abdiqassim and the leaders of Sudan,
Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Djibouti.</TE>

<HD>Several Clinton Alumni Staking Political Claims</HD>
<DH>Government: Former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno is among the familiar
faces running for office in upcoming elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Love him or hate him, you won't find Bill Clinton's name on the
ballot anywhere this year. But plenty of folks who worked for the 42nd
president are lining up to fill that void.</LD>
<LD>   Several veterans of the Clinton Cabinet are running for governor in
campaigns across the country, including former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in
Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Today, former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is expected to formally
announce his gubernatorial bid in New Mexico. Former Labor Secretary
Robert B. Reich earlier this week kicked off his bid to govern
Massachusetts. And Andrew Cuomo, former secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, is running in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Another batch of former White House aides and others with posts in the
last administration are aiming to join the former first lady, Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of renewed political life for these Clinton acolytes is
sure to torment those Republicans who despised Clinton from the day he
entered the White House to the day he left it.</TE>
<TE>   But at heart, the phenomenon appears to be a typical show of political
ambition by former public servants who believe their careers are far from
over, even if the Clinton presidency is.</TE>
<TE>   One virtual certainty is that any candidate this year with a resume
link to the Clinton administration will attract extra attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The day people stop being somewhat obsessed with Bill Clinton, I'll
have a party at my house," said former White House Press Secretary Joe
Lockhart. "Everybody's invited. But I'm not calling the caterer yet."</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart, who is not running for office, said he's gotten a number of
letters from his former colleagues in search of cash for their campaigns.
"It's getting expensive for me."</TE>
<TE>   For Republicans, there are pluses and minuses to the boomlet of
Clinton-connected candidates. On one hand, many of them get lots of free
press and some will be able to raise lots of money, making them
potentially formidable opponents. On the other, the GOP is well-schooled
in the art of attacking all things Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently these former Clinton staffers share a great deal of the
love for the limelight that their old boss certainly enjoyed," said Rudy
Fernandez, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. "That
apparently was an addictive thing running through the Clinton
administration. They're having trouble accepting the role of regular
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Warming to the subject, Fernandez added: "I have great faith in the
American voters, and most people are not going to want to return to the
Clinton era, which was plagued by scandals."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are tied to Clinton in varying degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Reich, for instance, was a longtime Clinton friend and his first Labor
secretary. But he left the administration after its first term, clearly
disenchanted that Clinton had not pursued various liberal initiatives.
The memoir on his service was titled "Locked in the Cabinet." He now is
waging an underdog candidacy to win the Democratic nomination to oppose
acting Gov. Jane Swift, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Reno, running for the Democratic nomination to oppose Republican Gov.
Jeb Bush, was the administration's only attorney general. Although White
House aides sometimes were frustrated by Reno's independence, Republican
critics charged that she protected the White House by refusing to
investigate alleged campaign finance abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, seeking an open governor's seat, had a political life
before Clinton. He was an eight-term congressman from New Mexico before
Clinton elevated him to U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1997 and
then to Energy secretary. He is attempting to resurrect his political
fortunes after controversies tarred that agency.</TE>
<TE>   Cuomo, running for the Democratic nod to challenge Gov. George Pataki,
is himself the son of a former New York governor, Mario M. Cuomo. The
younger Cuomo was HUD secretary from 1997 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Curry, a onetime aide in the Clinton White House, is competing in
Connecticut to take on incumbent Republican Gov. John Rowland.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates with greater and lesser ties to Clinton are vying for
Senate and House seats. Erskine Bowles, White House chief of staff when
the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal erupted, is the leading Democratic
candidate for an open Senate seat in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The leading Republican contender is Elizabeth Hanford Dole, wife of
Clinton's opponent in the 1996 presidential race, Bob Dole.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, former Clinton White House advisor Rahm Emanuel is running
in a crowded Democratic field for an open House seat. The winner of a
March primary, in the heavily Democratic district, likely will be elected
in November.</TE>
<TE>   Another former White House aide, Fred DuVal, is running for an open
House seat in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   One factor behind the Clinton-linked candidates is that many were
relatively young when they served in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys were barely shaving" when Clinton took office, said Amy
Walter of the Cook Political Report in Washington. "They were young,
ambitious folks. Now they're at 'that age.' "</TE>

<HD>Justices Look at Taxing Tips</HD>
<DH>Law: The Supreme Court weighs the IRS' use of estimates when
assessing a restaurant's federal payroll levy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court took up a case Friday from San Francisco's oldest
Italian restaurant to decide whether the government can tax eating
establishments based on an estimate of the tips earned by their waiters
and bartenders.</LD>
<LD>   The outcome is not likely to have a direct impact on waiters and other
employees, but it may result in higher payroll tax bills for restaurant
owners.</LD>
<LD>   These owners are required to pay a Social Security tax of 7.65% on the
money earned by their waiters and other employees. However, because much
of their income comes through tips, the owners cannot know exactly how
much their waiters earn.</LD>
<TE>   They might rely on the reports from waiters themselves, but the
federal tax collectors say only about half of tip income is reported.</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of collecting more money, the Internal Revenue Service has
turned to estimates drawn from credit card receipts.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Fior d'Italia, a North Beach restaurant that dates to
the 1880s, tax collectors decided that the income from tips must be about
15% of the restaurant's total gross receipts for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Using this method, the IRS figured the restaurant had underreported
its tip income by $156,545 in 1991 and $147,529 in 1992. It then sent the
restaurant a back tax bill of $11,976 for 1991 and $11,286 for 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The owner paid a portion of the bill, but went to court to challenge
the IRS' method of calculating tips.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, on a 2-1 vote, said
the IRS had erred by "assessing restaurants based only on the rough, and
somewhat inflated estimates" of the tips earned by their employees.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Alex Kozinski said the IRS should "audit the employees" rather
than "slap the employer with assessments based on aggregate estimates."</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Judge Margaret McKeown said there "is nothing magical"
about what the IRS is doing. It "has simply devised a practical means of
calculating the tip income."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers appealed the issue to the Supreme Court,
saying the appeals court ruling threatened to undercut the government's
stepped-up collection efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of tip income reported nationwide has risen from $8.52
billion in 1994 to $14.31 billion in 1999, the solicitor general said.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court will hear the case, U.S. vs. Fior d'Italia, 01-463,
in late April and issue a ruling by July. The National Restaurant Assn.
says 170,000 restaurants would be affected by the outcome.</TE>
<TE>Death Penalty Sentencing by Judges Reviewed</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide a crucial question on how
the death penalty is imposed in Arizona and eight other states.</TE>
<TE>   In these states, a judge, not the jury, decides whether a convicted
murderer will receive a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Until two years ago, the Supreme Court had upheld these laws as
constitutional. But in a New Jersey hate crime case, the court ruled,
5-4, that extra prison time imposed by a judge on a man who had
threatened his neighbors was unconstitutional. The court's opinion said
jurors must decide whether the extra punishment was warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Timothy Ring, an Arizona murderer, said the same principle
should apply to their client. A jury convicted him in the 1994 killing
and robbery of a Wells Fargo driver. In a separate hearing, the judge
concluded that Ring planned the crime and shot the driver. The judge
sentenced him to die.</TE>
<TE>   The majority in the New Jersey case, however, was an odd
configuration. It included liberal Justices John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by conservatives Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   If the high court rules that the Arizona system is unconstitutional,
it could affect 795 death row inmates in Arizona, Alabama, Colorado,
Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Montana and Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Arguments in Ring vs. Arizona, 01-488, will be heard in April.</TE>
<TE>Punitive Damages</TE>
<TE>   The court agreed to decide if local governments can be hit with
punitive damages, as well as payment for actual losses, if they violate
the rights of a disabled person.</TE>
<TE>   An appeals court upheld $1.2 million in punitive damages, in addition
to $1 million for actual damages, in the case of a paraplegic who said he
was mistreated by Kansas City police after being arrested (Barnes vs.
Gorman, 01-682).</TE>
<TE>Student Information</TE>
<TE>   The court also said it would decide whether colleges can be sued for
disclosing private information about a student or a former student.</TE>
<TE>   The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act was intended to protect
the privacy of students' records, but it is unclear whether Congress
meant to allow damage suits against schools and colleges (Gonzaga
University vs. Doe, 01-679).</TE>

<HD>Troopers Reach Deal in N.J. Shooting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Two New Jersey state troopers who fired 11 shots at a van carrying
minority passengers reached a plea bargain with the state Friday,
avoiding a trial on charges of attempted murder, attorneys said.</LD>
<LD>   Troopers John Hogan and James Kenna are expected to plead guilty
Monday to lesser charges, according to defense attorney Robert
Galantucci. As part of the agreement, federal prosecutors will drop any
plans to get involved in the controversial 1998 case. "It's over. There
will be no prosecution from the federal authorities," Galantucci said.</LD>
<LD>   Although details of the plea remained under wraps, both men are
expected to serve probation rather than prison time and to resign from
the state police force, sources close to the case said. State and federal
attorneys did not comment or return phone calls Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike, which sparked a nationwide
protest concerning racial profiling, led to sweeping reforms in the
Garden State's police tactics and admissions by officials that minority
motorists had been targeted.</TE>
<TE>   The case also shook up the state politically, embarrassing former Gov.
Christie Whitman and triggering an unsuccessful effort to impeach Peter
G. Verniero, a member of the state Supreme Court. Verniero, who was
attorney general at the time of the shooting, was accused by legislators
of covering up the incidence of racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey minority leaders had charged that Hogan and Kenna's
behavior was widespread among troopers. While state officials initially
defended the agency against charges of racism, Whitman and others
eventually pledged to root out police behavior that they admitted had led
to the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department, which had threatened
to sue the state for violating motorists' civil rights, New Jersey
officials vowed to eliminate racial profiling, a practice in which police
pull over a disproportionate number of minority drivers based solely on
race. Studies at the time showed that minorities accounted for 30% of
turnpike traffic but made up more than 70% of drivers stopped.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1998, the two troopers pulled over a van carrying four men:
three blacks and one Latino. They were headed to a basketball clinic in
North Carolina; none of them was armed.</TE>
<TE>   What should have been a routine traffic stop for speeding turned
violent when the van accidentally shifted into reverse and began rolling
slowly toward the approaching officers, according to court documents.
Hogan and Kenna together fired 11 shots into the van, wounding three of
the men.</TE>
<TE>   State investigators later concluded the troopers were not in imminent
physical danger, as they had claimed, and that they had fired
unnecessarily. The defendants settled a lawsuit with New Jersey for
$12.95 million.</TE>

<HD>'Brownfield' Cleanup Law Signed by Bush</HD>
<DH>Land: The program offers financial and legal aid to communities to
develop abandoned industrial sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush signed into law Friday a bill that offers new
incentives, including $200 million in aid, for communities and developers
to clean up abandoned industrial sites and turn them into commercial,
residential and recreational spaces.</LD>
<LD>   The law also provides expanded liability protection for those willing
to develop such "brownfields."</LD>
<LD>   That provision, Bush said, plus the new funding--a doubling of current
federal spending for brownfields cleanup--should hasten the restoration
of such sites.</LD>
<TE>   Bush estimated that nationwide there are 500,000 to 1 million
brownfields. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a coauthor of the bill, said
67,000 have been identified in California.</TE>
<TE>   Bush described the new law as a job-creating measure and a tool to
help curb urban sprawl, saying it will "enhance prosperity and the safety
of Americans living in urban areas."</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize the issue, the president traveled to this western suburb
of Philadelphia and signed the legislation at the Millennium Corporate
Center, a onetime 30-acre steel foundry that is now a high-tech business
complex with more than 800,000 square feet of office, retail and
recreational space.</TE>
<TE>   Gesturing to a young family in the audience, Bush said: "When I saw
the family over there, it reminded me that we have more responsibilities
than just those on the war [on terrorism]. And that is, we've got a
responsibility of making sure every child is educated and that the
environment in which our children grow up is healthy and clean."</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony capped a week during which Bush sought to tout his
environmental credentials, which are highly suspect among some activists.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he signed an agreement to ensure that the water-deprived
Florida Everglades has first claim rights to water from a massive
$8.4-billion reclamation project. On Thursday, he signed two measures to
help conserve endangered African elephants, rhinoceroses and tigers.</TE>
<TE>   "Environmental protection and economic growth can go on together,"
Bush said Friday. "It is possible for the two to exist, if we're wise
about public policy."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's event also afforded Bush another opportunity to spotlight a
popular and bipartisan measure. On Monday, he traveled to three states as
part of signing ceremonies for a sweeping education reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   The White House relishes these opportunities, in part because this
year's congressional session is likely to be marked by sharp
disagreements, and potential stalemate, on an array of domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's bill-signing elicited an outpouring of favorable reaction.
"Enactment of this brownfields law shows that when Congress and the
president work together, we can help our economy, protect our environment
and improve the quality of life for all Americans," said Sen. Harry Reid
(D-Nev.).</TE>
<TE>   The measure provides liability protection for prospective purchasers
of brownfields, contiguous property owners and landowners who did not
contribute to a site's pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "Many communities and entrepreneurs have sought to redevelop
brownfields. Often they could not, either because of excessive regulation
or because of the fear of endless litigation," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a consequence, small businesses and other employers have located
elsewhere, pushing development farther and farther outward, taking jobs
with them and leaving cities empty."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation also gives assurances to developers that once a state
approves a brownfield cleanup plan, the federal government will not
require additional work.</TE>
<TE>   With the law, Bush said, "we are returning common sense to our cleanup
program. We will protect innocent small-business owners and employees
from unfair lawsuits and focus our efforts instead on actually cleaning
up contaminated sites."</TE>

<KH>THE ENRON INQUIRY</KH>
<HD>Houston Leaders Back CEO Lay--for Now</HD>
<DH>Community: Many in Enron's hometown are not ready to alienate one
of the city's most generous benefactors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>While politicians in Washington distance themselves from Enron
Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay, leaders in the energy
company's hometown say they aren't turning their backs on the embattled
executive. At least, that is, for now.</LD>
<LD>   Snubbing Lay likely would mean alienating one of the city's most
generous benefactors--something that many leading Houstonians don't seem
prepared to do.</LD>
<LD>   That goes for political candidates too, said Bob Stein, a political
scientist at Rice University. "So far, the feeling is, 'If I got money
from Ken Lay, I ain't giving it back. I didn't do anything wrong.' "</LD>
<TE>   Stein, who is helping recruit candidates for an endowed chair in Lay's
name in Rice's business department, added, "This is the Ken Lay chair. I
can tell you my president and my provost have no problem going on
recruiting."</TE>
<TE>   Lay and his wife, Linda, are still on the Houston charity circuit.
They are among the numerous co-chairs of the annual "A Celebration of
Reading" fund-raiser chaired by former President Bush and Barbara Bush,
scheduled for April.</TE>
<TE>   And the Lays are the honorary chairs of the Holocaust Museum Houston
dinner in March.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some signs of fraying have emerged in the Lays' social network.
The Lays stepped aside as honorees of the nonprofit I Have a Dream
organization's gala in April, which raises money to help low-income
children stay in school and take advantage of tutoring and mentoring
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Kaitlyn Bloomquist, a spokeswoman for the charity, said the Lays were
concerned about "the prospect of asking for financial support [for the
charity] at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it was announced Friday that Lay had resigned effective
Dec. 31 from the board of Compaq Computer Corp., another corporate giant
based in Houston. Lay had been on the computer maker's board for 15
years. A company spokesman said he had no information about why Lay quit.</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, there is a "reservoir of goodwill for Ken Lay because the
company has been a philanthropic and civic leader for years," said
Richard Murray, a political scientist at the University of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "I suspect he'll be ordering out more for food. Too many people
have been hurt profoundly," Murray said, referring to thousands of
employees who have lost jobs and had retirement investments nearly wiped
out by Enron's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Texas politicians who have benefited from Lay or Enron's wide-ranging
contributions probably will feel some heat too. That includes Gov. Rick
Perry, who, after President Bush, is the biggest Texas recipient of
political donations from Enron, its executives and politician action
committee, according to Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, political scientists say the Enron collapse has killed Lay's
political aspirations and those of another prominent businessman, Marc
Shapiro, who oversees finance and risk management at J.P. Morgan Chase,
which provided billions to Enron. Lay and Shapiro once were thought to
have a good shot at the Houston mayor's seat in 2003, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim C. Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, the
city's chamber of commerce, said Houstonians generally feel empathy for
Lay. But he and others acknowledged that creditors and ex-employees
probably feel differently.</TE>
<TE>   Kollaer said that though he normally runs into Lay frequently at
social events around town, he hasn't seen Lay socially since the company
sought Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Court protection last month.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, Stein said, most Texans haven't been troubled by cozy
relationships between business and politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Texans are much less moralistic about the kind of things we expect or
tolerate," he said. "It's just business." And with Houston's boom and
bust economy, bankruptcies are built into the culture here.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Stein said, the Enron bust and the controversy surrounding Lay
might arouse ill will.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day brings a new story about someone who was laid off from
Enron and just had a baby and can't get insurance," he said. "This one is
different. A lot of people were affected personally."</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Baehr, a spokeswoman for the Society for the Performing Arts in
Houston, said, "I think everyone's willing to give Ken Lay the benefit of
the doubt until proven guilty. He was such a huge supporter of the arts
in Houston."</TE>
<TE>   Baehr offered her thoughts from the partly darkened 37th floor of the
Enron building in downtown Houston. Enron allowed the Society of the
Performing Arts to move in temporarily after its offices were flooded
during a tropical storm last year. "We don't know what's going to happen
to Enron and what's going to happen to us," she said.</TE>

<HD>Contested Bush Nominees Bypass Senate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Leading Democrats criticize a pair of controversial
recess appointments made by the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush appointed two controversial nominees to senior
administration jobs on Friday, using his executive powers to skirt a
recalcitrant Senate that had refused to act on the nominations of Eugene
Scalia and Otto J. Reich.</LD>
<LD>   The appointments, made while Congress is in recess, further strain a
worsening White House relationship with Democrats, which was growing all
the more rocky Friday over questions about administration contacts with
Enron Corp. executives.</LD>
<LD>   Without fanfare, the White House announced that Bush was placing Reich
in the post of assistant secretary of State for Western Hemisphere
affairs and Scalia in the job of solicitor of the Labor Department.</LD>
<TE>   Both took office Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The two men have been magnets for criticism--Reich for his role during
the Reagan administration, when he oversaw a covert program seeking to
gain support for the contras who were fighting to overthrow the leftist
Sandinista government in Nicaragua, and Scalia for his opposition to
ergonomics regulations for workers.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate had refused to hold a committee hearing on Reich's
nomination. Scalia's nomination narrowly won committee approval, but
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) had delayed a full chamber
vote on him.</TE>
<TE>White House to Press for Confirmations</TE>
<TE>   Under the Constitution, while Congress is in recess the president can
appoint individuals to serve for the remainder of a congressional
session. Thus, Reich and Scalia will serve, without Senate confirmation,
until the conclusion of the congressional session that begins this month
and is likely to end shortly before the November election.</TE>
<TE>   The White House says it will still press the Senate to confirm the
two, allowing them to serve beyond the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Their appointments had been telegraphed by the White House, and Bush's
action drew only muted criticism in the Senate, even from some of their
most vocal critics. They drew quiet praise from longtime supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said Bush's decision to make recess appointments was
"regrettable."</TE>
<TE>   He said Democrats had promised to schedule a vote on Scalia but that
his "record of hostility toward worker protections would have made his
confirmation unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   Ann Womack, a White House spokeswoman, said the Senate's failure to
act on either Scalia or Reich "left the president with no other options."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) was among Reich's most outspoken
critics, and he said Friday that there was little chance Reich would win
confirmation to his new post as long as Democrats control the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd, a veteran member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the
assistant secretary would be "a lame duck as soon as he takes the
position."</TE>
<TE>   He said Reich's appointment meant that U.S. policy in Latin America
"is being sacrificed for a narrow domestic political agenda."</TE>
<TE>   This was a reference to the support Reich has received from the
Cuban-American National Foundation, a conservative, anti-Castro group
with strong political roots in South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The nomination of Reich, who was born in Cuba, has been a cause
celebre among many in the politically active Cuban American community.</TE>
<TE>Both Nominees Are Conservative Favorites</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called Reich, a former ambassador
to Venezuela, the most important among the State Department's unconfirmed
nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "He has done nothing--nothing at all--in his career in government that
should be seen as disqualifying for this job," Powell said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia has also been a favorite among conservatives, in part because
his father is Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said: "I regret the
administration's action. I continue to believe that Mr. Scalia is not the
right person for this important Labor Department position. His record and
experience do not reflect a commitment to the rights of America's
workers."</TE>
<TE>   In a more blunt reaction, John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO,
said Scalia's appointment is "a slap in the face of American workers."</TE>
<TE>   The solicitor of the Labor Department is responsible for enforcing
about 180 laws governing workplace safety and health, unemployment
compensation, minimum wage provisions and job training, and is the
department's third-highest position.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives lauded Bush for bypassing the Senate with the two
appointments. Thomas L. Jipping, director of the Center for Law &amp;
Democracy, said Senate Democrats played "vindictive partisan games" with
the nominations.</TE>
<TE>   In modern times, as the size of the government has grown, presidents
have often resorted to recess appointments to fill positions while the
Senate is out of session.</TE>
<TE>   During his two terms, President Clinton used the power 140 times,
according to a tally by the Congressional Research Service. Bush's father
made 77 recess appointments in four years; President Reagan made 240 in
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Most recess appointments are not controversial. Senators shrugged this
week when Bush appointed John Magaw to head a new transportation security
agency in an effort to place him in the job quickly.</TE>
<TE>Clinton Used Power to Fill Key Post</TE>
<TE>   But some attract notice, particularly when presidents use the power to
go around obstacles to confirmation raised by an opposing party.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, in his second term, was thwarted by the Senate Republican
majority when he sought to appoint Bill Lann Lee as assistant attorney
general for civil rights. But ultimately Clinton found other means to put
him in the job, including a recess appointment.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Communist Reich Given State Dept. Post</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>His father was an Austrian Jew who escaped the Nazi Holocaust by
fleeing to Cuba. His mother was a Catholic Cuban who escaped Havana after
Fidel Castro came to power. Their son, Otto Juan Reich, came to America
at 14 with a personal and passionate distrust of dictatorships.</LD>
<LD>   Now 56, he is the assistant secretary of State for Western Hemisphere
affairs, named by President Bush in a recess appointment Friday intended
to circumvent the opposition of Democrats who refused to hold hearings on
his nomination.</LD>
<LD>   Critics, led by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), revile Reich for
what the U.S. comptroller general called "prohibited, covert propaganda
activities" in support of the contras who battled the communist
Sandinista government of Nicaragua in the 1980s. At the time, Reich was
public diplomacy advisor at the State Department.</LD>
<TE>   They charge that Reich, while U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, helped a
known terrorist, Orlando Bosch, seek asylum in the U.S. (State Department
officials say Reich opposed the visa request.)</TE>
<TE>   And opponents say Reich is an ideologue, not a diplomat, whose
appointment is a bouquet to the Cuban Americans in Florida who helped put
Bush in office.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, this wasn't [Secretary of State] Colin Powell's choice,
this was [White House political director] Karl Rove's choice," said
William Goodfellow, executive director of the Center for International
Policy. During the confirmation process, Goodfellow started an anti-Reich
site on the Internet: http://www.stopottoreich.net.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders counter that Reich, unapologetic for his fierce
anti-communism, is an ideal candidate. With Argentina in financial
meltdown, Colombia's fragile peace talks with guerrillas in collapse and
Mexico suffering from Washington's focus on anti-terrorism, Latin
America, they argue, needs Reich.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have to fight for controversial policies, you need a
political type who knows about [Congress] and can fight within the
administration for time and attention," said Jose Sorzano, a former U.S.
diplomat at the U.N. who now runs a consulting firm that arranges joint
ventures between U.S. and Latin American companies.</TE>
<TE>   Reich wrote his master's thesis in Latin Studies at Georgetown
University on the totalitarian trademarks of dictatorships. A disciple of
Thomas Jefferson, he is fond of quoting the former president's famous
line: "I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every
form of tyranny over the mind of man."</TE>
<TE>   Reich, raised as a Roman Catholic, is proud of the background of his
father, a furniture manufacturer who fled oppression in Europe and Cuba
before coming to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But Sorzano, who served with Reich in the Reagan administration,
thinks he knows the key to Reich's character: "Regardless of where his
parents came from, he's a Cuban. Like any Cuban, he's voluble."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Like his father, conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia,
Eugene Scalia prompts a strong reaction.</LD>
<LD>   In the eyes of labor groups and occupational safety experts, Scalia,
38, is a flat-out "danger" to the safety of U.S. workers. They see a
lawyer who has worked for the last decade on behalf of big business,
someone who has dismissed ergonomic studies and the rules generated by
them as "junk science."</LD>
<LD>   Conservatives, on the other hand, defend Scalia as a skilled attorney
whose nomination to the No. 3 slot at the Labor Department was held up by
Democrats as payback for his father's part in the Supreme Court's
decision that tilted the Florida recount--and the presidential
election--toward President Bush.</LD>
<TE>   No one has quarreled with his credentials, just the assignment Bush
had for him as the Labor Department's chief lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who chairs the Health, Education and
Labor Committee, called Scalia an "outstanding lawyer" who was ill-suited
for the Labor Department post.</TE>
<TE>   In an October vote, the committee forwarded Scalia's nomination to the
full Senate by the narrowest of margins, 11 to 10, with former GOP Sen.
James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.) lining up with his old party.</TE>
<TE>   "The Solicitor of Labor is the workers' lawyer, responsible for
protecting the interest of millions of working men and women," Kennedy
said at the time. "Yet Mr. Scalia is well-known for his long-standing
opposition to workers' rights and protections."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to such complaints, Senate Democratic leaders made clear
they had no plans to schedule a final vote on his nomination.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago
Law School--both schools where his father had been a professor--Scalia
has worked as an attorney for the last decade. He has been married for
eight years and has three children.</TE>
<TE>   At Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, a powerful law firm with offices a short
walk from the White House, Scalia almost exclusively has represented
major corporations. When he testified on Capitol Hill at the October
hearing, he conceded that in his 10-year labor-law career, he has
represented only two workers.</TE>
<TE>   Foes of his nomination say articles Scalia wrote on his own time--most
notably a commentary that appeared two years ago in the Wall Street
Journal--indicated a level of hostility toward workers that went beyond
professional concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia asserted in the Wall Street Journal piece that unions were
seeking ergonomic regulations as a means of increasing their dues-paying
ranks by slowing down productivity with added breaks and forcing
companies to hire more employees.</TE>
<TE>   The article infuriated organized labor and union officials say it is
statements such as those--not anything to do with his father--that fueled
their opposition.</TE>

<HD>1 Man Dead, 3 Missing After Fast Boat Flips Over</HD>
<DH>Accident: A 30-foot leisure craft being tested at high speed on
Lake Castaic capsizes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rescuers recovered one body and searched Friday night in deep, dark
water for three others after a high-performance family boat the men were
testing capsized in Castaic Lake, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   All but one of the men were employees of High Torque Marine, an Agua
Dulce, Calif., company that specializes in building and selling
high-speed boats.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County lifeguards recovered the body of Ken Lane, 41, of
La Crescenta about 2 p.m., almost immediately after the boat flipped. He
was the firm's engine builder, according to a company official.</LD>
<TE>   "We do understand that they were traveling at high speed in a
speedboat, but we don't know yet if that's why they capsized," said Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Brenda Cambra. The speed limit
on the lake is 35 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Missing are Steve Coulombe, 38, of Agua Dulce, the company's owner;
Nelson Ray Brinkman, 30, an assistant engine builder from Phelan; and
Chuck Wiseman, 47, a customer and Coulombe's friend.</TE>
<TE>   The county dive team arrived about 8 p.m. and began searching the area
about a quarter-mile north of Castaic Lake Dam. The lake is about 30
miles north of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At about 11 p.m., the search was called off after a sonar scan located
the boat at a depth of about 246 feet. The search was expected to resume
at daybreak, but county divers would not return, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that we don't have the capability to dive 240
feet," Deputy Bryan White told the two dozen family members and friends.</TE>
<TE>   The boat "just came out of the mold about three or four weeks ago,"
said Roy Ayers, a company design engineer and manager.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve would never hand a boat to a person that was untested," he
said. "He was known for making sure that anything produced by him was
fully tested, certified and safe for a family to get in."</TE>
<TE>   Ayers described the boat as fast, about 30 feet long with amenities
such as a stateroom bed and a DVD player.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd compare it to, say, the Corvette of boats," Ayers said. Although
fast, it's not the kind of boat--large as it is--that he thought would
have this kind of accident, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was very unexpected," Ayers said. "This was more like a family
boat."</TE>
<TE>   Coulombe and the others probably had gone to the lake to see if the
vessel needed to be fine-tuned, Ayers said. Coulombe was proud of the
craft, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve said, 'This boat is beautiful. We got another winner in our
hands. People won't believe how great it is,' " Ayers recalled.</TE>
<TE>   High Torque Marine has about 25 employees and has been in operation
about six years, Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a very tightknit group," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He described Coulombe and Lane as "two people who talked motor talk.
Both were motorheads."</TE>
<TE>   "Ken was a very personable guy," Ayers said. "He was an avid engine
builder; he had his own company building motors. He and Steve just hit it
off real good. . . . He was a very meticulous mechanic."</TE>
<TE>   Lane was married and had a son, Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   Coulombe, a speedboat racer, was married and had two daughters, 12 and
8, Ayers said. He described him as affable, with an infectious
personality that lent itself to making friends easily.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkman had visited the company with a customer several years ago,
was between jobs, and was recruited as an employee, eventually becoming

<HD>1 Dead, 3 Are Missing in Boat Accident</HD>
<DH>Castaic Lake: All but one of the men are employees who were testing
out a new model that capsized.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rescuers recovered one body and searched hours Friday night for
three others after a high-performance family boat the men were testing
capsized in Castaic Lake, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   All but one of the men were employees of High Torque Marine, an Agua
Dulce, Calif., company that specializes in building and selling
high-speed boats.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County lifeguards recovered the body of Ken Lane, 41, of
La Crescenta about 2 p.m., almost immediately after the boat flipped. He
was the firm's engine builder, according to a company official.</LD>
<TE>   "We do understand that they were traveling at high speed in a
speedboat, but we don't know yet if that's why they capsized," said Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Brenda Cambra.</TE>
<TE>   Missing are Steve Coulombe, 38, of Agua Dulce, the company's owner;
Nelson Ray Brinkman, 30, an assistant engine builder from Phelan; and
Chuck Wiseman, 47, a customer and friend of Coulombe.</TE>
<TE>   The county dive team arrived about 8 p.m. and began searching the
300,000-acre lake, which is about 30 miles north of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The boat had "just came out of the mold about three or four weeks
ago," said Roy Ayers, a company design engineer and manager.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve would never hand a boat to a person that was untested," he
said. "He was known for making sure that anything produced by him was
fully tested, certified and safe for a family to get in."</TE>
<TE>   Ayers described the boat as fast, about 30 feet long with amenities
such as a stateroom bed and a DVD player.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd compare it to, say, the Corvette of boats," Ayers said. Although
fast, it's not the kind of boat--large as it is--that he thought would
have this kind of accident, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was very unexpected," Ayers said. "This was more like a family
boat."</TE>
<TE>   Coulombe and the others probably had gone to the lake to see if the
vessel needed to be fine-tuned, Ayers said. Coulombe was proud of the
craft, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve said, 'This boat is beautiful. We got another winner in our
hands. People won't believe how great it is,' " Ayers recalled.</TE>
<TE>   High Torque Marine has about 25 employees and has been in operation
about six years, Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a very tightknit group," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He described Coulombe and Lane as "two people who talked motor talk.
Both were motorheads."</TE>
<TE>   Coulombe was married and had two daughters, 12 and 8, Ayers said. He
described him as affable, with an infectious personality that lent itself
to making easy friends.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkman had visited the company with a customer several years ago,
was between jobs, and was recruited as an employee, eventually becoming
an assistant engine builder, Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very anxious to learn," Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   Wiseman was a customer who became a fan of the company's boats after
buying one, Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   He owned Mr. Pump, a concrete foundation company, and Creative Works,
a subcontracting company, both in Castaic. Dave Johnson, who has worked

<HD>Schools Shake-Up Pleases Some, Worries Others</HD>

<LD>Cheryl Smith has spent 18 frustrating years teaching English to
students who sometimes can barely read. So she hopes the upcoming
reorganization of Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights will improve
literacy for the school's 5,000 students. "I'm extremely happy," she
said.</LD>
<LD>   Many other staff members at Roosevelt are embracing the personnel
shake-up--including the pressured retirement of its principal--that is
part of the Los Angeles Unified School District's new campaign to improve
10 of its most troubled schools. But the effort also is rattling nerves
at Roosevelt and the other targeted campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Some staffers at these schools are skeptical about whether the changes
will address such deeper problems as overcrowded classrooms and
inexperienced teachers. Others say they will leave for easier
assignments. Many are simply anxious about job security, so fearful that
they ask not to be identified.</LD>
<TE>   "I just think it's really unfair," one teacher said about the
principal's removal and a state audit that strongly criticized
instruction at Roosevelt. "We're good teachers without good conditions to
work in."</TE>
<TE>   In the first wave of shake-ups in the nation's second-largest school
district, administrators are being reassigned or pressed to leave at
Roosevelt, Wilson High in El Sereno, Locke High in South Los Angeles and
Sun Valley Middle School in the San Fernando Valley. Three Sun Valley
teachers also will leave.</TE>
<TE>   The district's actions come in response to state audits last fall that
found low expectations, rundown buildings, weak teaching in many
classrooms, and little parental involvement at the campuses.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Supt. Roy Romer reiterated the district's commitment to
carry through and possibly expand the staff changes in coming months. The
district is looking at 14 other schools that could face similar
shake-ups, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer also said the reassignments are part of an improvement campaign
that will significantly increase teacher preparation. Instructors at some
campuses will have to agree in writing to get extra training and abide by
other conditions to keep their current jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make these schools perform at a much higher level,"
Romer told a news conference at district headquarters. "We really mean
business here."</TE>
<TE>   Some campuses will be broken up into smaller "academies," where
students can get more attention and the separate administrations are
supposed to be more accessible. Roosevelt, for example, could have three
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   District officials have already decided that Sun Valley will have
three such academies.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Christina Serrano accepts the reassignments of Sun Valley's
principal, four other administrators and three top teachers. But Serrano
said her fellow teachers also need to stop blaming others and take a
serious look at their own low expectations for their students.</TE>
<TE>   "No one here has asked themselves how willing they are to change," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Serrano and others said the fury over the personnel changes has
overshadowed the dedication of many teachers who want to improve academic
achievement, a sentiment shared by the school's interim principal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a very concerned faculty that wants a change. Nobody
should be arrogant to think that their plan is the only plan," said Peter
Ferry, who is leading the campus temporarily since the departure of
Principal Manuel Rangell.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-grader Samantha Aguado, 12, said students will have their own
responsibility in trying to improve Sun Valley's image. "It's not the
teachers' fault that students don't learn," she said as she was walking
to class. "It's the students' fault. They don't concentrate."</TE>
<TE>   At Roosevelt High, senior Daniel Torres carried a chunky paperback of
Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace" in his hand and complained that teachers
didn't give him enough to read in class.</TE>
<TE>   He said one teacher spent nearly an entire semester on one novel, "The
Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck. "They have really low expectations,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes are encouraging some Roosevelt teachers, but eroding the
confidence of others. At least five have indicated that they may transfer
to other schools in the district or leave it altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Ronquillo, Roosevelt's principal, blamed elementary and middle
schools for failing to teach basic reading skills before students enter
high school. Ronquillo has a strong following in Boyle Heights, where
supporters call him an "institution" and the "face of the campus."</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers say it's time for him to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is long overdue," said Ron Kendrick, who has taught at
Roosevelt for 33 years and is the teachers union representative on
campus. "Ronquillo's been here for nearly 20 years, and there's been no
significant improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Drafts of the shake-up plans are drawing a mixed reaction from members
of the Board of Education.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not plans that will bring any lasting change because schools
are very complex human organizations, especially inner-city poor
schools," said board member David Tokofsky. "We're responding to this in
stereotypical fashion without any deep assessment about how these schools
are functional or dysfunctional. Moving two or three people is not a
lasting or significant solution."</TE>
<TE>   But board President Caprice Young said the reassignments will give the
schools a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's time for people to stop making excuses and to do what's
right for the kids," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Board Vice President Jose Huizar said the district must now find
competent replacements and give them financial and moral support.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken some bold steps," he said. "We need to see who we
actually place in these schools, to make sure they have the vision and
ability to swim upstream."</TE>

<CX>   School reorganization--An article in Saturday's California section
about reorganization at some Los Angeles schools incompletely described
faculty member Cheryl Smith's reaction to changes at Roosevelt High.
Although she expressed no opinion about the departure of the school's
principal, the English teacher said she supports state-recommended
changes to improve students' literacy. "I'm extremely happy that the
state is finally focusing on the same thing I was focused on for 18
years," she said.</CX>

<HD>State to Allow Radioactive Debris at Regular Landfills</HD>
<DH>Environment: Group that fought nuclear waste dump in Mojave Desert
files suit over new disposal policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A little more than two years after the state abandoned plans to
open a nuclear waste dump at Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert, officials
are set to allow shipment of radioactive debris to ordinary landfills
never designed to safely store such material.</LD>
<LD>   Under a policy finalized in November by the state Department of Health
Services, dirt and debris from decommissioned nuclear power plants and
other mothballed facilities could be disposed of without the oversight,
licensing and monitoring that have long been required of all radioactive
waste.</LD>
<LD>   Although Ward Valley would have been closely monitored, the site,
about 20 miles from the Colorado River, raised fears that radioactive
particles could migrate to the river or into other drinking water
sources.</LD>
<TE>   Now, critics of the latest policy fear that similar radioactive waste
will instead wind up in poorly designed landfills, where it could emit
radiation at levels more than 10 times higher than would have been
permitted at the Mojave Desert site.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 170 municipal waste facilities in the state and no one
knows if they'll become nuclear waste sites, and it's all happened
overnight and under cover of dark," said Dan Hirsch, president of the
Committee to Bridge the Gap, which opposed the Ward Valley site and is
suing the state over the new disposal policy.</TE>
<TE>   The state's top radiologic health official countered that a provision
of federal law has always allowed disposal in landfills of radioactive
debris and soil from decommissioned nuclear sites.</TE>
<TE>   The official said his agency has adopted recently toughened federal
standards for how much radiation can remain at dismantled nuclear
facilities before they are freed from regulation and material from them
is eligible for disposal elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been released a few years ago at much higher
[radiation] levels," said Edgar Bailey, chief of the Radiologic Health
Branch of the state Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, just more than two years ago, Bailey informed
Safety-Kleen Inc., an industrial waste site operator in Kern County, that
accepting any material with the most minimal amounts of radiation "would
be a violation of California law." Safety-Kleen had been accepting
material from a former Manhattan Project site in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The new state policy, however, applies only to material from sites
that have been "released for unrestricted use," which had not happened at
the New York site that sent its material to Safety-Kleen.</TE>
<TE>   In California, at least half a dozen power plants and laboratory sites
are poised for decommissioning. If the sites are given a clean bill of
health by regulators, they can be used for a variety of purposes, even
for new housing or parks.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission allows unrestricted use of a
decommissioned facility if what remains at the site won't expose a
hypothetical resident to more than 25 millirems of radiation
annually--roughly equal to about 2 1/2 chest X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing on the site can exceed that amount," Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   "To get that dose, you have to be living on the site, you have to grow
your crops there, and you have to drink from the wells there."</TE>
<TE>   But the 25-millirem exposure level is not a measure of the
radioactivity of specific waste matter or chunks of soil. It is a measure
of the intensity of radiation that would percolate out on hypothetical
pathways, and is based on factors that include soil densities and the
type of development expected in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Activists and landfill regulators worry that truckloads of dirt or
individual items of debris could be both "hotter" than would have been
allowed at Ward Valley and much more exposed to the public at municipal
landfills, which are not equipped or licensed to isolate radioactive
waste.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey acknowledged that there is "a remote possibility" that some
debris from a decommissioned site could be more radioactive than the
overall average for the site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's astounding that [the Department of Health Services], not even
having a clue on how municipal landfills are set up, makes a rule that
affects all the landfills in the state," said David Roberti, a member of
the California Integrated Waste Management Board, which oversees the
operation of municipal landfills statewide.</TE>
<TE>   The Ward Valley facility, near Needles, was to have radiated no more
than 2 millirems per year--less than one-tenth of the 25-millirem level
the Department of Health Services now would allow a decommissioned site
to radiate.</TE>
<TE>   A closer look at the federal regulations adopted by the state,
however, shows that exceptions can be granted that would allow
decommissioned sites to radiate at levels many times higher than 25
millirems.</TE>
<TE>   Antinuclear activists warn that such a scenario is likely. This week,
they said, the Department of Energy decided it would clean up the former
Rocketdyne site in Simi Valley only to its department standards and not
to the stricter levels required by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. That difference in standards can translate to a steep increase in
the statistical odds of cancer in populations exposed to hazardous
chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey said material from the former Rocketdyne facility could be sent
to landfills, but only after it has been cleaned up to a promised level
of 15 millirems.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the waste that is leaving that is above 15 millirems is
presently going to a low-level waste site, and it probably would go out
of state anyway because it's a Department of Energy project," Bailey
said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Flood Insurance Mandate Ends in Southeast L.A. County</HD>
<DH>Water: Completion of the Los Angeles River restoration project
reduces the risk for property owners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 50,000 property owners in southeast Los Angeles County will
no longer be forced by the federal government to maintain costly flood
insurance now that a $210-million restoration project along the Los
Angeles River has been completed.</LD>
<LD>   The project, launched in 1996 and finished five years early and $154
million under budget, reduced the flood risk for property owners in 11
cities and unincorporated county areas from Downey south to Long Beach
Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   About 250,000 property owners around the Los Angeles River and the Rio
Hondo have paid an estimated $22 million collectively for flood insurance
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had mandated since 1998.</LD>
<TE>   That is when the Army Corps of Engineers determined that the lower
river could not contain a so-called 100-year flood. FEMA maps were
redrawn to indicate the increased flood risk, and lenders insisted on
insurance to protect their interests. The premiums averaged $400 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Irate policyholders, who consider the premiums a "flood tax," have
badgered politicians ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In blue-collar Paramount, nearly every property owner was affected,
said Mayor Manuel Guillen, who got his own renewal notice for his flood
insurance Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very-low-income people who are the least able to pay for it.
They've been knocking on our front doors about this," he said, referring
to the City Council. "So it's a real monkey off our backs."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Drainage Area Project was created by Congress
in 1996 to better protect citizens from a potential 100-year flood--an
event with a 1% chance of occurring in any given year.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, it was championed by Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Long
Beach), who has worked with federal, state and local officials to lobby
for the project.</TE>
<TE>   Horn was praised for his commitment to the flood-control project by a
parade of public officials at a news conference at Downey City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's hard to get excited about . . . flood insurance," said
county Supervisor Don Knabe, whose 4th District includes most of the
affected area. But he noted that for the people involved, "it's a big
deal."</TE>
<TE>   As originally envisioned, the project called for raising the river
banks, or levees, by four feet or more on each side. The new levees would
allow a third more water to flow in the Los Angeles River, which acts as
a mega-flood-control channel dumping into the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The restoration was expected to cost $364 million and take 10 years to
complete. A big part of the cost and time would have come from raising 23
bridges--most of them vehicle overpasses--along with the riverbanks.</TE>
<TE>   But the Army Corps of Engineers came up with an ingenious way to avoid
some of that work. Although levees were raised in some areas, most of the
bridges were not. Devices to streamline water flow were attached to the
bridge support pilings, which allowed more water to move faster
downriver, eliminating the need to raise the banks in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   The work was done in three phases, as federal funds budgeted by
Congress allowed. The first phase was finished Feb. 25, 2000, and
property owners in its vicinity were released from the flood insurance
mandate. The second phase was completed May 24, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The project was completed just weeks ago. Price tag: $210 million. The
Army Corps did the work along with crews from the county Department of
Public Works.</TE>
<TE>   So what actually happened Friday? FEMA redrew its flood insurance rate
maps. And that set into motion the prospect of 50,000 policyholders
seeking government help to be released from the insurance mandate and to
seek refunds.</TE>
<TE>   This being a federal project, many acronyms and maps with expressions
such as Zone X are employed to help guide property owners.</TE>
<TE>   FEMA's Web site, http://www.fema.gov, has information on the project,
as do the offices of Rep. Horn, Supervisor Knabe and most of the city
halls in the communities affected--Bellflower, Carson, Compton, Downey,
Lakewood, Long Beach, Lynwood, Montebello, Paramount, Pico Rivera, South
Gate and the unincorporated area of Rancho Dominguez.</TE>
<TE>   Property owners can find out if they are still required to have flood
insurance from FEMA or their local government. If the insurance is no
longer mandatory, they should contact their mortgage lender or bank and
request the all-important "Letter of Map Revision." Only the lender can
provide it.</TE>
<TE>   An important note federal officials made Friday: A lender may still
demand flood insurance.</TE>
<TE>   But "a vast majority of the lenders will not require the flood
insurance," said Michael Shore of FEMA's National Flood Insurance
Program. All premiums are deposited in the program's trust fund. It may
refund a property owner's last annual premium; form letters are available
from Horn, FEMA, Knabe or city offices.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a pleasure tomorrow to go down and apply for my rebate,"
Bellflower Mayor Ray Smith said.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Targets Plan for Yosemite</HD>
<DH>Parks: Proposal to limit parking spaces, campsites is too severe,
prominent GOP congressman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>A prominent California congressman is pushing to undo key elements
of the Yosemite Valley preservation plan that is meant to reduce traffic
and keep campsites away from ecologically sensitive areas.</LD>
<LD>   As the new chairman of the House's national parks subcommittee, Rep.
George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa) has raised questions about what he
considers too few parking spaces and campsites allowed by the Yosemite
planning blueprint, which he considers biased against the needs of
tourists.</LD>
<LD>   "What we're trying to do is seek a balance between environmental
preservation and public use," Radanovich said Friday. "I think they erred
on the side of the environmentalists. They want to make the park so hard
to get into that people just won't come."</LD>
<TE>   But environmentalists, who fought hard to see the valley planning
blueprint pushed through in the waning days of the Clinton
administration, expressed fears over the direction Radanovich could steer
the park restoration process, which is expected to be phased in over the
next 10 to 15 years at a cost of $442 million.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Watson, the Wilderness Society's California regional director,
said the reductions in campsites and parking spots--efforts meant to help
nature recover from a century of trampling by mankind--represent the
heart and soul of the restoration plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these changes would render the plan almost meaningless,"
Watson said. "It is a serious challenge to the plan."</TE>
<TE>   Radanovich toured the park Thursday and Friday with the Bush
administration's new national parks director, Fran Mainella. After talks
with parks officials, Radanovich said the various players agreed to go
forward with noncontroversial parts of the Yosemite plan and put off the
tough decisions for later.</TE>
<TE>   He said no consensus was reached on two key issues--how many day
parking spaces and campsites should be tucked between the valley's sheer
granite cliffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are really the two things that we feel we need to continue
working on," Radanovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Until flood waters in 1997 swept through the valley, 849 campsites
were nestled in the valley, many along the banks of the Merced River. The
plan proposes allowing only 500 campsites on the floor of the park, which
is visited by about 4 million people each year.</TE>
<TE>Parking Feasibility Study Is Underway</TE>
<TE>   Congress, however, has approved funding for a study of the feasibility
of boosting the number of campsites to the historic levels desired by
Radanovich. The study is to be finished by December.</TE>
<TE>   Radanovich also said a decision on parking cuts will be delayed for
several years while various roadway system improvements are made. The
valley has about 1,600 day parking spaces, but the plan calls for a
reduction to 550 in conjunction with improvements in shuttle service from
remote lots outside the park.</TE>
<TE>   Radanovich said he would prefer 1,200 spaces remain in the park and
questions whether a robust shuttle bus system will be needed.</TE>
<TE>   He said such a plan would send tourists through a virtual "Checkpoint
Charlie" system. Once valley parking reached a limit, "some would be
stopped and turned around," he said. "The public is not going to tolerate
a goofy system like that."</TE>
<TE>   Radanovich also vowed to use Congress' power of the purse strings if
necessary. "Having the plan is one thing," he said. "Getting it funded by
Congress is another. Those who want the plan are going to have to get
money for it."</TE>
<TE>   The congressman said he is hopeful that efforts will focus on the most
simple and least costly improvements. "Then, we'll step back and see if
those things solved our problems."</TE>
<TE>   Wrangling over the park's future has dragged on for decades. But the
flood waters of five years ago forced the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Congress approved $178 million in emergency funds, and shortly
thereafter work began in earnest on planning to carry the park into the
21st century.</TE>
<TE>   After four years of planning and more than 10,000 public comments, the
Yosemite Valley Plan was heralded as the solution to a century of human
impact in the narrow, seven-mile valley.</TE>
<TE>   It calls for the removal of several dams and bridges on the Merced
River. Park offices would be shifted to adjacent towns. Meadows and
woodlands sullied by development would be restored. Hiking and biking
trails would be expanded. Half the park workers would be moved out of the
valley.</TE>
<TE>   Radanovich has long been at odds with the final version of the valley
plan. After it was approved in November 2000, he called for hearings,
saying the blueprint would prove too costly to taxpayers and hurt
surrounding gateway communities economically linked to Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   Many business owners in those communities at Yosemite's doorstep fear
that reducing overnight accommodations inside the park and boosting bus
ridership could freeze out family campers who have been their best
customers over the years.</TE>

<HD>Panel Urges State to Limit Human Cloning to Research, Therapy</HD>
<DH>Science: Report calls for a ban on using the process to produce
babies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES MEDICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California should ban cloning of human embryos for the purpose of
producing babies but allow cloning for research and medical purposes,
according to a long-awaited report drafted for the state government by a
team of medical, legal and ethics experts.</LD>
<LD>   The committee recommends that cloning be allowed only under
regulation, and says cloned embryos should not be implanted in a womb or
grown past a very early stage of embryo development--roughly 14 days
after fertilization.</LD>
<LD>   The report comes at a time of rapidly developing scientific interest
in cloning and a growing national debate.</LD>
<TE>   At the federal level, a stalemate has so far blocked efforts to enact
legislation on the subject. The House of Representatives has passed a
bill to ban all forms of human cloning. But in the Senate, scientific and
health organizations that argue for allowing so-called therapeutic
cloning so far appear to have enough support to block that bill.</TE>
<TE>   The debate gained additional urgency late last fall when a
Massachusetts company, Advanced Cell Technology, said it had cloned a
handful of human embryos that grew to the six-cell stage.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of action in Washington could leave control of the issue to the
states. As the state with the largest number of biotechnology
companies--and one of the few that has a law banning
cloning--California's actions could be of particular importance.</TE>
<TE>   "Things seem to have come to a standstill right now in Congress," said
state Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), head of the Legislature's committee
that will consider cloning. "I do think other states are watching and
waiting. If Congress fails to act, then they may be looking to see what
California's law looks like."</TE>
<TE>   California has a temporary five-year ban on reproductive cloning that
expires at the end of this year. The committee's report was mandated to
help shape legislation before then.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimous report of the 12-member committee, which will be
presented to the Legislature on Monday, is being lauded by experts in
bioethics and science. Supporters praise the panel for carefully
considering the contentious issue and reaching what they think is a
palatable middle ground.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a balanced and thoughtful report whose recommendations are based
on good science and good ethics," said Eric Meslin, director of the
Indiana University Center for Bioethics in Indianapolis and former
executive director of President Clinton's National Bioethics Advisory
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But others, including Catholic and antiabortion groups, say the
report's recommendations are morally repugnant because they permit human
embryos to be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's proposal is not "a ban on cloning at all--it's a ban
on live birth. It allows unlimited cloning and then requires the clones
to be destroyed instead of being born alive. That's an immoral policy,"
said Richard Doerflinger of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The chief medical argument for cloning of embryos is linked to yet
another controversial research arena--that of embryonic stem cells. Such
cells, which exist in very young embryos, can develop into all the
tissues of the body. If scientists can learn to guide these cells' fates,
they could create new therapies for maladies such as Parkinson's disease
and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   If such tissues were grown from a clone of the intended patient, the
body would be far less likely to reject the tissue as foreign,
researchers believe. That would greatly increase the usefulness of the
therapies while reducing side effects.</TE>
<TE>   "There's enormous promise, though there's still a long way to go,"
said committee member Dr. Larry Shapiro, professor and head of the
department of pediatrics at UC San Francisco and past president of the
American Society of Human Genetics.</TE>
<TE>   The committee members said the medical promise of such research
justifies it. Studying very early embryos raises fewer ethical problems
than allowing cloned children to be born, committee members said.</TE>
<TE>   The panel recommended that any work on cloned human embryos be done
with full informed consent of those supplying biological materials, and
that all experiments--whether paid for with private or public funds--be
subject to approval by a review board that would assess the ethical
nature of the research.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the committee recommended that embryos not be studied
past the primitive "streak stage" of development, about 14 days after
conception. Until that point an embryo does not have any nerve cells and
therefore cannot feel pain or be aware of its circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Zoloth, a bioethicist and head of the Jewish studies department
at San Francisco State, applauded those conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "Their policy would allow creative science to go forward--which the
House bill does not--yet allow for the public concern about the abuse of
cloning to be recognized," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But USC bioethicist Alexander Capron said he would prefer to see a
moratorium on all forms of cloning.</TE>
<TE>   If some forms are allowed, it will be almost impossible to prevent
unscrupulous laboratories from trying to clone babies, he said. Since
researchers are nowhere near being able to produce clones for therapy,
there would be little cost to continuing a moratorium, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning for reproductive purposes has considerably less scientific and
political support.</TE>
<TE>   Since the first cloned mammal--the sheep Dolly--was created in 1997,
many animals have been cloned, including cows, pigs, goats and an
endangered species of ox. But only a small fraction of cloned embryos
survive to birth and those that do can have serious health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists suspect that these and other problems arise because the DNA
of cloned animals is subtly abnormal--it may, for instance, be already
"old" because it came from cells of adult animals instead of eggs and
sperm.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of such safety issues is still not clear, but the risks
alone are more than enough to justify a ban on reproductive cloning, said
committee member Henry Greely, co-director of the program in genomics,
ethics and society at Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about a cow miscarrying very much, but I am worried
about women miscarrying, having stillbirths and having babies with birth
defects," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, most of the committee said reproductive cloning should be
banned for societal and moral reasons too, Greely said.</TE>
<TE>   Some advocates for infertile couples disagree with that position.</TE>
<TE>   The societal and safety risks of human cloning have been overstated,
said Mark Eibert, a lawyer who works as a patient advocate for people
with fertility problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Cloning is a cure for infertility," he said. "It should be developed
in the same responsible way that other medical treatments are developed."</TE>

<HD>Airlines Want End to Noise Limits</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Restrictions at John Wayne, including nighttime flight
curfews, should end in 2005, trade group says. City, county seek
extension to 2015.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A powerful trade group of the nation's airlines will fight a
proposal by Orange County and Newport Beach to extend landmark noise
limits at John Wayne Airport, including preserving its nighttime curfew.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for the Air Transport Assn. warned county officials this
week that airlines believe the constraints on hours of operation, jet
noise and the number of passengers each year must end as scheduled Dec.
31, 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The deadline is contained in a 1985 court agreement that governs
airport operations. City and county officials hope to extend the
agreement next month until 2015, with a slight expansion of flights.</LD>
<TE>   Katherine Andrus, assistant general counsel for the association, said
the county will have to conform to the 1990 Airport Noise and Capacity
Act, a federal law that ended the power of local governments to limit
airport activity. The law also requires airlines to replace their fleets
with quieter jets, a conversion to be completed by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no mention of the requirements of federal law" in the county
proposal to extend the restrictions, Andrus wrote to local officials. It
"fails to recognize that operations at John Wayne Airport will be
unconstrained by the agreement as of Jan. 1, 2006."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Gatzke, who has represented the county on aviation issues for
30 years, said officials will defend their right to continue the curfew
and other airport limits. He added that the restrictions are contained in
ordinances passed before Congress changed the law in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The county's attorney noted that the airline industry group's
perspective was expected because it generally opposes operational
restrictions at airports. "We'll deal with it as part of the
environmental [review] process," Gatzke said.</TE>
<TE>   The showdown comes as voters prepare for Measure W, a March ballot
initiative that calls for an urban park instead of a commercial airport
at the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach officials, pushing to prolong the controls, fear that
pressure will grow to expand John Wayne if a new facility isn't built at
El Toro. Newport Beach and other cities near the airport benefit from the
curfew and limits on jet noise.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions resulted from a 1985 settlement signed by Newport
Beach, the county and two neighborhood groups that fought airport
expansion. A federal judge accepted the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne Airport is one of two California airports that restrict the
number of daily flights. The other is Long Beach Airport, with a limit of
41 commercial flights a day. Restrictions there also were grandfathered
in because they were approved before 1990.</TE>
<TE>   At John Wayne Airport, airlines are limited to 73 daily flights using
louder aircraft and bonus flights for airlines using jets that create
less noise on takeoff. There are about 130 commercial flights a day.</TE>
<TE>   The county, which began enforcing a nighttime flight curfew in 1968,
bans commercial takeoffs between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., and arrivals between
11 p.m. and 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also limits the airport to 8.4 million passengers a
year through 2005. About 7.3 million passengers used the terminal last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Under several expansion options being considered by city and county
officials, the passenger cap could be eliminated immediately. The
preferred option calls for no more than 10.8 million passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, as many as 10 loading gates would be added, bringing the
total to 24. The number of daily flights would jump as high as 181. More
cargo activity would be added to the present two flights a day.</TE>
<TE>   If the county wants to keep its restrictions, Andrus said, it would
have to comply with the 1990 law, which includes a comprehensive noise
study proving that the controls would not hurt interstate commerce. The
prospect is so onerous that no airport has been granted a waiver to the
1990 law.</TE>
<TE>   In October, voters endorsed a curfew for Burbank International
Airport, which is being challenged in court. The restriction is part of a
measure that prohibits the city from approving airport construction or
renovation unless certain conditions are met.</TE>
<TE>   The Burbank measure forbids the city from adding new runways,
lengthening existing ones or building a new terminal without approval by
two-thirds of the city's voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Agency has insisted that Burbank cannot impose a
curfew without first conducting a noise study. That study, which is
underway, will not be finished for a year.</TE>

<HD>Judge Clears Man Who Spent 2 Years in Jail</HD>
<DH>Courts: Authorities believe someone else committed Anaheim robbery
for which he was imprisoned. D.A., challenger disagree on the review
process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Friday dismissed charges against a man who spent two
years in custody for a robbery authorities now believe someone else
committed--prompting a candidate for Orange County district attorney to
propose an examination of recent wrongful convictions.</LD>
<LD>   George Lopez's case marks the fifth instance in two years that charges
have been dropped against people convicted of robberies in the county.
The cases turned on eyewitness testimony that ultimately proved
unreliable.</LD>
<LD>   Wally Wade, a veteran prosecutor running for district attorney, said
the office should take a hard look at all five cases, then use lessons
learned to train prosecutors and police on how to prevent wrongful
convictions.</LD>
<TE>   "The reason you analyze the past is to learn from it. I think these
cases would be good examples," Wade said. "There are too many of these
cases. I have no doubt the prosecutors and police are acting in good
faith. But good faith doesn't get a man a year or 20 years of his life
back."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, 19, was serving a 13-year sentence for the armed robbery of an
Anaheim loan office when questions about his conviction began to surface.
First, two victims of the crime stepped forward to profess his innocence.
Last summer, another man told The Times that he, not Lopez, committed the
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, who is running for reelection, said his
office acted prudently in the Lopez case, agreeing to dismiss the case
this week after its own investigation cast doubt on Lopez's guilt. He
said Wade's suggested remedies are unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Our prosecutors train about eyewitness cases all the time,"
Rackauckas said. "This is not anything new. . . . He just sees this as an
opportunity to try to help his campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said that in 2000 he teamed with Public Defender Carl
Holmes to launch a first-of-its-kind project that investigates prisoners'
claims of wrongful convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason these people are being released is we have an attitude, if
someone's not guilty, we're going to let them out," Rackauckas said. "I
didn't see that under the past administration."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, 19, spent more than two years in custody before a judge ordered
his release in September as questions about his guilt mounted. Lopez left
the Santa Ana courthouse Friday hand-in-hand with his wife, saying he
hopes that the dismissal of the case will help him find a job.</TE>
<TE>   He said no one should have to go through what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my job. All the money I'd saved for an apartment and wedding
went to pay the lawyer," Lopez said. "This can't keep happening. They're
playing with people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Wade questioned Rackauckas' handling of the Lopez case, faulting the
district attorney for not ordering an investigation when questions about
Lopez's conviction first surfaced more than a year ago. Wade also said
Rackauckas has a duty to examine what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to analyze why this is happening because it shouldn't be,"
Wade said. "Police officers and D.A.s cringe at the idea that an innocent
person is going to be convicted. So for this many to have been wrongly
convicted is disturbing to everyone in law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   The five recent wrongful convictions in Orange County had some common
threads. All involved armed robberies, and the convictions were based in
large part on the testimony of victims.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists have reported for many years that testimony from victims
of crime can be unreliable. Wade said prosecutors need to make sure they
take additional caution in dealing with those cases.</TE>
<TE>   "All jurors receive special instructions in cases involving eyewitness
testimony. Prosecutors should also receive specialized training on
evaluating eyewitness testimony," Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Giannini, director of the Orange County Alternate Defenders
Office, agreed that a new approach to eyewitness testimony is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone in this business, we know the most unreliable evidence is
eyewitness evidence," he said. "When it's a total stranger who's robbing
you and you're under stress, the reliability goes way down."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said his concern now is providing for his family and raising the
money to have a traditional wedding. He and his wife, Leah, were married
by Judge Daniel J. Didier moments after his sentencing in 2000. It was
Didier who dismissed the case Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I remember from our wedding day is he had to sign the
wedding certificate and I could hear the handcuffs hitting the table,"
Leah Lopez said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Judge's Porn Case Must Move</HD>
<DH>Courts: All three federal jurists in the county recuse themselves
because of personal ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing numerous conflicts of interest, the entire Orange County
bench of federal judges has removed itself from the criminal case of a
local Superior Court judge accused of possessing child pornography,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The case against Judge Ronald C. Kline will be moved to federal court
in Los Angeles, said U.S. attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek.</LD>
<LD>   Kline, 61, has pleaded not guilty to seven felony charges alleging
that he stored more than 100 illegal pornographic images on computers at
home and work.</LD>
<TE>   Mrozek said federal prosecutors learned Friday that two of the three
U.S. judges based in Santa Ana had recused themselves because of close
ties to Kline.</TE>
<TE>   The third jurist, District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, had removed
herself in December, noting a "friendship and professional relationship"
that she and her husband have with Kline.</TE>
<TE>   After Stotler, the case was reassigned to U.S. District Judge Gary L.
Taylor. But defense attorneys told the judge last week that he might have
a conflict as well.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers said in court papers made public Friday that Taylor had a
perceived "close and congenial relationship" with two men who had
promised to support Kline's defense as character witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The prospective witnesses, attorney William Wenke and Orange County
Superior Court Judge Raymond J. Ikola, once worked alongside Taylor when
all three were partners at a law firm, according to the court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Ikola worked as a civil judge down the hall from Kline's judicial
chambers in the county's Santa Ana courthouse. Three weeks after Kline
was indicted, Ikola signed papers nominating Kline for reelection to the
bench, the court records said. Wenke has twice visited Kline in recent
weeks, documents said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, nevertheless, urged Taylor to keep the case, arguing that
"the citizens of this community are entitled to have the case heard in
[Orange County] where the crimes occurred."</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor disagreed. And he was joined this week by U.S. District
Judge David O. Carter, who worked as a state court judge alongside Kline
before joining the federal bench in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate criminal case, state prosecutors on Thursday charged
Kline with molesting a 12-year-old boy a quarter-century ago. That case,
too, has been moved to Los Angeles County to avoid a conflict of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   The latest charges make for a highly unusual judicial election in
March. The judge remains a candidate for reelection even though he is
confined to his home. Kline is running unopposed on the ballot, though
eight people have announced they will be write-in challengers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 43-year-old Simi Valley man has been arrested on suspicion of
worker's compensation insurance fraud for allegedly lying to his employer
about a car accident.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Brendon Crump, an online sales manager for the Ventura County
Star, allegedly told his employer and the newspaper's insurance carrier
he was injured in a hit-and-run accident while on the job.</LD>
<LD>   But a five-month fraud investigation revealed that Crump was actually
injured when he was run over by his own BMW while trying to stop the car
from rolling out of his garage, according to county prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Crump, who was released on $10,000 bail, is scheduled to be arraigned
on fraud charges Jan. 25. He faces up to five years in state prison if
convicted.</TE>

<HD>4 Are Charged in Rape of Woman, 18, at Home</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police say the suspects--three of whom live in North
Hollywood, the other in Studio City--may have drugged her with GHB.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four men were arrested early Friday and charged with rape and
sexual assault after an 18-year-old Simi Valley woman said they had
attacked her in her bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   Police are investigating the possibility that the woman was drugged
before the attack.</LD>
<LD>   Det. Sgt. Mike King of the Simi Valley Police Department said a 911
call was received at about 4 a.m. from the victim's male roommate, who
said the woman had been raped.</LD>
<TE>   King said the victim knew one of the suspects, 19-year-old Jeffrey
Pineda, and had expected him to visit her. The man showed up with three
male friends the victim didn't know. The woman let them into the house,
where she rents a room. The four men had an alcoholic drink and gave the
victim a glass of water. They all went to her bedroom to watch
television, police said.</TE>
<TE>   King said the victim later became aware that she was disrobed and was
being sexually assaulted by the men, who allegedly ignored her cries to
stop.</TE>
<TE>   At about 5:30 a.m., police arrested the suspects in their car near the
Ronald Reagan Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The men were identified as Pineda of North Hollywood; Dejon Lashadell
Lee, 19, of North Hollywood; Brian Ali Jafari, 19, of Studio City; and
Yan Karim, 19, of North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   King said the victim's blood and other liquids around the house will
be tested for GHB, or gamma hydroxybutrate. The drug, a powerful
tranquilizer, can be mixed in a drink and can render a victim incapable
of resisting an attack. It has been used frequently in sexual assaults.</TE>

<HD>Bus Driver Faces 11 Additional Counts</HD>
<DH>Crime: The charges stem from alleged assaults by suspect over
5-year span.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An MTA bus driver already awaiting trial for allegedly molesting a
15-year-old boy aboard a bus will also be tried for allegedly sexually
assaulting a police officer and his brother when they were minors two
decades ago, a judge ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell said there
was sufficient cause for Anthony Zaragoza to stand trial on 11 felony
counts involving the brothers, whom he met while driving for a Montebello
bus line.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy-Powell ordered that Zaragoza be held on $1-million bail
pending his next court appearance Jan 25. Zaragoza has pleaded not guilty
to the 11 counts, which include lewd conduct, sodomy and oral copulation.
He also pleaded not guilty to molesting the 15-year-old boy he met on his
bus last summer.</LD>
<TE>   The officer and his brother, who were identified as John Doe 1 and
John Doe 2 respectively in court, came forward after they saw a news
report about Zaragoza last year.</TE>
<TE>   As a 13-year-old in 1979, the officer, with his 11-year-old brother,
met Zaragoza as he drove a Montebello transit bus they took back to their
Pico Rivera home from a movie theater. Zaragoza became friends with the
brothers' family and became their godfather. They sometimes stayed
overnight at his home.</TE>
<TE>   The officer testified that on one overnight stay, a naked Zaragoza,
under the guise of showing how to put on a condom, forced the boy to
touch the driver below the waist.</TE>
<TE>   "In a stern voice he said, 'Touch it,' " the officer, now 35,
testified. "I was scared. I trusted him." That same night, he said, the
bus driver also asked him to put on a condom, an act he refused to do.</TE>
<TE>   The officer testified that he never told anyone of the incident until
August when he saw a television broadcast involving the charges against
Zaragoza. He immediately called his brother, then contacted the Los
Angeles police.</TE>
<TE>   His younger brother testified that he was molested by Zaragoza the
first day they met, in April 1979, and "every time I'd seen him." Often
teary-eyed on the witness stand, he recalled details of at least eight
incidents that began the night he met the driver.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened a lot of times after that . . . till I was 16 years old,"
John Doe 2 said.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that Zaragoza molested him in a bathroom at the
Montebello transit station, the boys' home in Pico Rivera, a U-Haul
lock-up and a Motel 6 in Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   John Doe 2 said he finally revealed the incidents to his family in
1987. At the time, he said, keeping it all bottled up had made his life
unbearable. He said he had lost his job, lost his girlfriend and was
contemplating suicide.</TE>
<TE>Mother, Son Shared Secrets</TE>
<TE>   Finally, when he talked to his mother about his confusion and pain,
she revealed a secret too. He said, "My mom said to me she was molested
as a child. And I said so was I."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Christina Weiss brought the prosecution under a
state statute that allows old incidents to be tried where there is
independent corroborating evidence.</TE>
<TE>   That evidence, prosecutors say, was captured in June when Zaragoza
allegedly tried to molest the 15-year-old, who happened to be carrying a
video camera while he rode Zaragoza's bus.</TE>
<TE>   With the camera pointing down, the boy pressed the "on" button when
Zaragoza approached him. Los Angeles Police Det. Raymond Conboy testified
that Zaragoza is heard on tape trying to persuade the boy to engage in
sex, saying he had done it with boys before.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza, 49, was placed on unpaid leave by the MTA after his arrest
last year.</TE>

<HD>MTA to Add Electric Scooters, Bicycles to Its Fleet</HD>
<DH>Transit: Devices would be leased to commuters living near stations
and park-and-ride lots to ease parking congestion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles may be the car capital of the world, but transit
officials think it is time commuters consider a new way to get around
town. Their chosen alternative: the electric scooter.</LD>
<LD>   Under a program scheduled for launch in April, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority will lease dozens of electric scooters and
bicycles to commuters who live near crowded transit parking lots.</LD>
<LD>   The program will offer the scooters and bicycles at a discounted
rate--as little as $10 a month--to people who now drive a mile or two to
catch a train or bus to work. After leasing the electric devices for a
year and a half, the commuters will own them outright.</LD>
<TE>   In exchange for the low lease rates, the chosen commuters would
participate in a survey about the benefits and drawbacks of using the
bikes and scooters to get around.</TE>
<TE>   The idea came from a handful of MTA transportation managers who are
determined to ease the crowding at transit stations and park-and-ride
lots.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been kicking around this idea for a while," said MTA
transportation project manager Walt Davis. "Why pay $20 a month for a
space at a park-and-ride lot when you can pay $10 a month for a scooter?"</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials have yet to decide how to select the commuters who would
qualify for the three-year pilot program.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is requesting $368,000 from the state to buy up to 500
electric scooters and bicycles, and even a few of the electronic
two-wheeled vehicles known as the Ginger.</TE>
<TE>   The Ginger is the much-ballyhooed, battery-powered gadget that debuted
in the national media last month. It looks like a lawn mower that is
ridden while standing up. The "self-balancing human transporter" costs
about $3,000 and can reach speeds of 17 mph.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials hope the sight of commuters in business suits zipping on
and off buses and trains will spark a new transportation trend.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea has already drawn some criticism from alternative
transportation advocates and others.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Crowley, president of California Cycleways, a Pasadena-based
group promoting the use of bicycles, said he is happy to see the MTA
promoting alternatives to smog-belching cars. But he wonders why the
agency doesn't simply encourage more people to buy human-powered
bicycles.</TE>
<TE>   "These electric bikes are expensive and they are heavy," Crowley said.
"I can't help but think that a regular old bicycle would work better."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the MTA could purchase regular 10-speed bikes for less
than $200 each.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials say they have been promoting the use of human-powered
bicycles by installing lockers at transit stations and bicycle racks on
MTA buses.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis said he hopes the electric scooters and bicycles will be
more acceptable to commuters who may want to avoid the physical exertion
of getting to and from a transit point.</TE>
<TE>   Crowley retorted: "We are talking about a mile or two here. We are not
talking any exertion."</TE>
<TE>   Russell Travis, a sociology professor at Cal State Bakersfield, agrees
with Crowley. Because most Americans can stand to lose a few pounds, he
suggests that the MTA simply promote the idea of walking to train and bus
stations.</TE>
<TE>   "Just walking a mile a day would do wonders for people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Ginger, it already has run into a few speed bumps.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, transportation experts said it probably would not be
legal to drive the device on sidewalks, and it would probably be too slow
to operate on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles transportation officials could not be reached to comment
on the use of the device.</TE>
<TE>   Segway, the company that developed the Ginger, plans to offer the
vehicle first for commercial use at such enterprises as Amazon.com and
the U.S. Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said MTA officials are expected to get a demonstration of the
Ginger in April.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Centers' Parent Tackles Financial Woes</HD>
<DH>Management: Nonprofit agency institutes bookkeeping procedures
designed to prevent the cash-flow problems that threaten to close four of
its seven sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Operators of a network of financially troubled Jewish community
centers in Los Angeles said Friday they will try to turn their agency
around with tighter budgeting and using outside accountants to oversee
money management.</LD>
<LD>   The changes are designed to prevent the nonprofit Jewish Community
Centers of Greater Los Angeles from ever again being caught by surprise
by cash-flow problems like the one that now threatens to close four of
its seven sites, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish leaders initially feared they would have to close five of the
centers when they discovered in October that they faced a $2.8-million
deficit in their $16-million operating budget. As the extent of the
crisis became known, the centers' chief financial officer resigned, and
officials announced that cultural and recreational programs would be
slashed and 49 employees would be laid off.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the popular Westside Jewish Community Center was spared
from closure and some of its programs and jobs were restored after
members raised $113,000. The fates of centers in Silver Lake, Santa
Monica, Sherman Oaks and Granada Hills are expected to be decided Tuesday
by directors of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The new bookkeeping procedures announced Friday include the hiring of
a Century City accounting firm, Licker+Ozurovich. The firm's founding
partner, Andy Ozurovich, will serve as the Jewish Community Centers'
chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   The changes were recommended by an independent consultant who spent
several months studying the organization's financial structure. The
consultant suggested that new daily and monthly financial reports be
implemented to allow for "accurate management monitoring," officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "With these moves, our agency will have the accountability in place
for all our financial systems," Marty Jannol, president of the community
centers, said in a statement. "This will allow us to move forward with
our restructuring with full financial accountability and transparency for
the community."</TE>
<TE>   Using the accounting firm for payroll administration, budget
preparation and other bookkeeping chores will save the centers $200,000 a
year, said David Novak, a spokesman for the centers.</TE>
<TE>   By more closely monitoring expenditures, directors of the agency will
be able to avoid future calamities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The agency has always run at a deficit. This year the magnitude of
the deficit was too large for us to continue going forward as we were
presently structured."</TE>
<TE>   Novak said the centers in Silver Lake and Santa Monica have been put
up as collateral for a $1.1-million loan to help with current bills. He
characterized the status of those centers and of the ones in Sherman Oaks
and Granada Hills as "fluid."</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the Jewish Community Centers will probably be sold. Decisions
will be made next week as to programming and which centers may be sold,"
Novak said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the extent of the financial crisis was a jolt, it came as the
result of decades of poor decision-making, said Jannol, a lawyer who
lives in Studio City and took over the unpaid position of agency
president last month. Declines in revenue accelerated last year as income
from activity fees dropped 20%; last fall, nearly a third of the centers'
users failed to renew their memberships, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, when "all of the indicators pointed to closing centers,
modifying programming and relocating, we lacked the courage to make the
hard decisions. . .," Jannol said. "Now we're prepared to."</TE>

<HD>County Jobless Rate Falls, but So Do Job Totals</HD>
<DH>Economy: Unemployment for December declines to 5%. There are also
900 fewer positions. One expert says the region 'was due for a hiccup.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's unemployment rate dropped sharply in December, but
the effects of the U.S. recession and statewide downturn were clearly
seen as the number of local jobs fell for the first time since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The county's jobless rate declined from 5.4% in November to 5.0% in
December, compared with 5.7% in California and 5.4% nationwide, without
seasonal adjustments.</LD>
<LD>   About 20,600 county workers were jobless last month, down from 22,000
in November but much higher than the 16,900 workers without a job in
December 2000.</LD>
<TE>   But analysts said the most telling development last month was that
total jobs in this affluent coastal county dropped by 900 to 297,700 from
November and were 200 below the total from a year before.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first loss of jobs since July 1996," said economist Mark
Schniepp of the California Economic Forecast in Santa Barbara. "We've
created more jobs every single month for 5 1/2 years. So Ventura County
was due for a hiccup."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly important was the year-to-year difference in employment
in businesses not related to farming, where jobs rise and fall with the
seasons, Schniepp said. Nonfarm jobs were off 1,200 from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting to lose more jobs than we're creating in the nonfarm
sector," he said. "This is the weakest employment report from that
standpoint that I've seen in many years."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers for one month do not yet indicate a trend, especially
since preliminary labor market statistics often change. Schniepp said it
would take three months of year-to-year job declines to indicate real
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "And when I look at other indicators, like home sales, home prices,
and commercial vacancy rates and construction, I'm not very concerned
about Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   The rate of increase in Ventura County home sales was the highest in
Southern California for the first 11 months of 2001, according to
DataQuick Information Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the loss of jobs is a concern, said Bill Watkins, director of
the Economic Forecast Project at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "The job loss is concentrated in the durable manufacturing sector, and
these are among the better-paying jobs in the county" he said. "It's this
sector nationwide that's really depressed, and we're seeing it here. But
it's relatively small, less than 10% of the employment base [here]."</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers of durable goods--such as machinery, industrial
equipment, tools and refrigerators--provided 25,800 local jobs in
December, 1,200 fewer than the year before.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is that this is associated with [cutbacks at] Boeing,"
Watkins said. "You have a bunch of little machine shops here that supply
the aviation industry."</TE>
<TE>   Local jobs in the manufacturing of nondurable goods--such as clothes
and food--remained stable at 14,500.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the job losses, Ventura County and the Southern California
region remained relatively strong compared with the overall California
economy.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the unemployment rates in Orange and San Diego counties
were the third and fourth best in the state at 3.2% and 3.3%,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's balanced economy produced strong gains in December in
retail businesses that hired 700 new workers for the holiday season.
Stores selling general merchandise also added 400 new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The agricultural industry accounted for 1,000 fewer jobs last month,
with a total of 19,100, 1,000 more than during December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   About 700 jobs were lost in the business services sector, which
Schniepp said reflected the beginning of Kinko's moving its headquarters
from Ventura to Texas. Construction employment also lost 200 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see what happens in the next month or two,
to see whether this is a trend," said Dan Hamilton, a colleague of
Watkins at UCSB. "If it doesn't last, and we still have Baxter and Amgen
[biomedical companies] still cranking along, the next few months could
look pretty good."</TE>

<HD>Cramming Over, Students Vie Today in Academic Decathlon</HD>
<DH>Brainpower: Fourteen Ventura County high schools battle in the
first round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moorpark High School senior Sheena Sidhu knew she had been studying
way too much when highlighters began cropping up in her dreams.</LD>
<LD>   Sheena, 17, has spent nearly 1,000 hours poring over mounds of study
material in preparation for this year's Academic Decathlon, the nation's
premier scholastic competition.</LD>
<LD>   Her collection of bright-colored pens has kept her organized--and,
oftentimes, sane.</LD>
<TE>   "If I can't find a highlighter, I start to panic," Sheena said.</TE>
<TE>   She is among nearly 200 Ventura County students who will compete at
Oxnard High School today in the first round of the Ventura County
Academic Decathlon.</TE>
<TE>   For the past six months--after school, before class, on weekends and
through winter vacation--the teenagers from Ventura to Simi Valley have
been crunching numbers, memorizing sonnets and rehearsing speeches.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen teams from 14 high schools will participate in this year's
event, which begins today with essay, speech and interview contests and
will culminate Feb. 2 in a second round of tests and the final Super
Quiz.</TE>
<TE>   The winning team, to be announced at a Feb. 4 awards ceremony at
Pacifica High School in Oxnard, will go on to a statewide competition in
Modesto at the end of March. The country's top teams will then face off
at the national finals in Phoenix in April.</TE>
<TE>   "The team to beat would be Moorpark High School, because they are the
defending county champion from last year," said Phil Gore, the county's
Academic Decathlon coordinator. "But we have several strong teams, so it
should be quite exciting."</TE>
<TE>   This year's contest again involves students from rival Moorpark and
Simi Valley high schools, who have traded the county title for the past
eight years. In 2000, Simi Valley beat Moorpark's team in the state
competition by one question.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, no teacher stepped up to coach Simi Valley's team so the
school was left out of the contest.</TE>
<TE>   This year's group, led by new English teacher Debbie Mjoen, is made up
mostly of sophomores who promise they will be a force to be reckoned with
in years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our first year, so the main thing is we want to make a good
impression," said Aroon Karra, 15. "We want to show that we're back and
that Moorpark will have some competition next year."</TE>
<TE>   One day last week, the teens were gathered in Mjoen's classroom, which
is decorated with study notes made into colorful posters. They watched
videos of themselves giving their prepared speeches and got tips from
Bruce Louie, a former decathlon judge.</TE>
<TE>   They also bounced around the room doing loud "speech circles"--in
which everyone delivers his or her four-minute soliloquy at the same
time--as a way to practice good concentration.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Jessi Pinkerton, 16, said she joined the team to meet
people. She accomplished that, she said, whether the team wins or not.</TE>
<TE>   Each team prepares for the event differently. At Oak Park High School,
students take a more relaxed attitude, said coach Cheryl DiSpaltro.</TE>
<TE>   They meet only twice a week for an hour and a half and try to study
using games they invent, such as a quiz styled on the game show "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see the kids put so much pressure on themselves that they
become over-stressed, so I try to keep it a little more casual," she
said. "They end up learning a lot about team spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in Moorpark, students sat in desks forming a small circle
and critiqued each other's practice essays. They did a test on music and
then took a break to read up on material for the Super Quiz.</TE>
<TE>   Their coach, history teacher Larry Jones, said this year's group is
one of the most dedicated he has seen. They go to Starbucks at 5 a.m. to
study before school and stay in his classroom until 8 p.m. four nights a
week. When he was scheduling study time during the holiday break, they
asked him for more days.</TE>
<TE>   "They are determined to do their best," Jones said. "If someone does
better than them, that team is going to have to be really good."</TE>

<HD>Report on Valley City's Administrative Costs OKd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sparking new protests from San Fernando Valley secessionists, the
Los Angeles City Council approved a report Friday pegging the first-year
cost of administering service contracts for a new Valley city at $16.3
million.</LD>
<LD>   That cost, which includes creation of a new citywide contract office,
would probably be factored into the contracts for the proposed Valley and
Harbor area cities for continued police, fire and other services during a
transition period of up to three years, said Chief Legislative Analyst
Ron Deaton.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think there is any doubt that there are going to be costs to
administer this contract," Deaton said.</LD>
<TE>   Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain dismissed the estimate as
"exaggerated."</TE>
<TE>   Brain said the deputy police chief in charge of Valley policing can
continue in that role, and the assistant general manager in charge of
parks in the Valley can maintain his oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't need to require a new department," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton said there will be additional duties involved in administering
the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not running a department when you are administering the
contract," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of the costs for administering the contract the first
year--$16 million--come from the Information Technology Agency, which
says it will be expensive to revamp the city's 145 computer systems to
handle two or more cities.</TE>
<TE>   "The estimate was based on the city's experience with Y2K-related
systems costs," said City Administrative Officer William Fujioka in a
report to the council.</TE>
<TE>   The report goes to the Local Agency Formation Commission, which is
studying whether it is financially feasible to create new cities in the
Valley, Harbor and Hollywood areas. LAFCO, which has not yet decided
whether to put the cityhood proposals on the November ballot, had
previously estimated the transition costs for changing computer systems
for contracting would be about $3.6 million for the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said Friday that they would need to dedicate 36
employees to contract administration functions, as well as provide office
space, adding to the costs. After the first year, the city would need $3
million annually to administer the contract, Fujioka said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming a week after city officials estimated they may need $304
million in alimony from the Valley city after contracts end, the latest
city report was denounced by Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close as
"another attempt to sabotage the process."</TE>
<TE>   "This report today is just another accounting fiction put out by the
city," Close said.</TE>

<LD>A private plane with crippled landing gear landed safely Friday
night at John Wayne Airport after the pilot circled for almost three
hours to burn off fuel and tried to lower a stuck wheel.</LD>
<LD>   Airport spokeswoman Christie McDaniel said the Cessna 172 RG landed at
7:43 p.m. and skidded about 2,700 feet before stopping in a grassy area.
The pilot and two passengers were not hurt, she said.</LD>
<LD>   The runway, which is also used by commercial jets, was closed for 30
minutes as crews removed the plane and some debris. Some arriving flights
were delayed but none were diverted, McDaniel said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The sentencing of a former California Highway Patrol officer
convicted of murdering his business partner was delayed Friday after
claims that jurors at his trial were guilty of misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Woods, 59, who was convicted of first-degree murder 12 1/2
years after Horace "Big Mac" McKenna was machine-gunned outside his Brea
residence, will appear in court again next month as a judge reviews the
claims.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to assertions by Woods' lawyers, Superior Court Judge
Kazuharu Makino has subpoenaed three jurors for questioning on Feb. 19.</LD>
<TE>   The accusations of juror misconduct are contained in a sealed file and
neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors would discuss the claims.
However, a source familiar with the case said the claims concerned
jurors' alleged impaired hearing ability and inattentiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The misconduct claims are part of a motion filed by defense lawyers
for a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   In August, prosecutors convinced jurors that Woods paid his bodyguard
$50,000 to arrange the slaying of McKenna in a bid to gain control of
several Los Angeles strip clubs the men owned.</TE>
<TE>   Woods faces a possible sentence of life without parole.</TE>

<LD>A 12-year-old Texas boy accused of starting a brush fire that
destroyed six homes in San Clemente pleaded innocent Friday during an
arraignment in juvenile court.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was released to his father's custody and will be permitted to
return to his El Paso home. The youth, however, must appear in Orange
County for a hearing Feb. 8.</LD>
<LD>   He faces three counts of arson of an inhabited structure and one count
of arson of a forest. The charges include destroying property worth more
than $2.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   The charges stem from an Aug. 1, 2001, fire that raged through
Trafalgar Canyon and caused $4 million in property damage. Authorities
say the boy was tossing matches into brush at the bottom of the canyon
because he wanted to see a fire grow.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by ocean breezes and heavy coastal sage, the fire raced up a
steep, quarter-mile slope and engulfed a million-dollar condominium
complex on Cazador Lane. It jumped to a second complex and destroyed more
units.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured, but dozens of residents were evacuated. Several
witnesses reported seeing two or three teenagers running from the area
near the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said it will seek restitution from the
boy's parents.</TE>

<LD>I wonder if this is how Atlantans felt when "Gone With the Wind"
debuted in 1939.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's going to bag on some things," 22-year-old Steve Hubert
says, standing in the lobby of a Brea theater before going in to see
"Orange County," the new movie about a high school senior who wants to
bolt Orange County for Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   It would be stretching things to say Hubert was stewing about it ("It
doesn't concern me, because I am what I am"), but I share his
trepidation, if only because I don't like being bagged on either, even
though I also am what I am.</LD>
<TE>   What I am not is a native Orange Countian, but my 15 years here has
engendered enough pride that I don't want Hollywood to make me look like
a danged fool. We all know how these movie people can be. I spent two
weeks in North Dakota in the summer of 2000, and many there still were
smarting--4 1/2 years later--from "Fargo," which made them look like
snowbound dullards.</TE>
<TE>   What if "Orange County" leaves America thinking we're nothing but a
bunch of shallow, materialistic sun-worshipers who talk really hip?</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry. Only most of the main characters in the movie are like
that. The hero is Shaun, a steadfast high school (Vista Del Mar?) senior
played by Colin Hanks (Hanks? Hanks? The name sounds familiar).</TE>
<TE>   Shaun opens the movie by saying, "I live in California in a place
called Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, so do I. At that moment, the movie had me.</TE>
<TE>   We quickly learn that Shaun's mother drinks too much, his father is
distant and remarried to a 20ish nympho and his older brother is a
perpetually high parolee and lovable lout. There's also the foxy,
promiscuous cheerleader and the inept high school guidance counselor and
English teacher.</TE>
<TE>   With these American archetypes firmly established, the movie gets on
with the story.</TE>
<TE>   That's when I really got hooked.</TE>
<TE>   One of Shaun's surfing buddies doesn't survive the Ultimate Wipeout,
and his death leaves Shaun pensive. He also finds a book left in the sand
and devours it. Wildly motivated, Shaun decides to become a writer but
concludes: "I don't know if Orange County is the best environment for an
aspiring writer."</TE>
<TE>   Bro, that exactly captures my life, except for the part about a buddy
drowning while surfing or finding a book half-buried in the sand. "I've
got to get out of here," Shaun decides. "I've got to get out of Orange
County."</TE>
<TE>   By now, I'm transfixed, practically seeing my life on screen. I am
totally relating to Shaun, dude, even though he's 18 and I'm 52 and he
has a sensitive high school girl friend and I don't.</TE>
<TE>   I won't give away the story, but let's just say Shaun overcomes all
the obstacles put in his path by bumbling people who all got together at
some unknown point and conspired to keep him from attaining his rightful
place on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun decides he doesn't need to go to Stanford to be a writer.</TE>
<TE>   I've reached the exact conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the theater, I was flushed, lightheaded.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, I compared notes with Steve Hubert, his twin brother Jeremy
and their pal, Nathan Keller, all of Brea.</TE>
<TE>   All three gave the movie six giant thumbs up. "I was, like, tearing up
laughing," Jeremy says. "Getting all jacked up at parties, it reminded me
of my old days."</TE>
<TE>   "It was totally O.C.," Nathan, 23, says enthusiastically. "That's how
being in high school in Orange County is. They got it perfect: the
parties, going to the beach . . . all the moms on anti-depressants."</TE>
<TE>   I ask Steve if the movie bagged on O.C., as he feared it might. "It
didn't really bag on it," he says. "If anything, it was a cool kind of
message that everybody is so worried about going to college. I thought it
was great."</TE>
<TE>   I predict big business for the movie. Word of mouth should be good,
and young Hanks has the same kind of likability as that guy who starred
in "Cast Away" and "Forrest Gump."</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, it didn't make Orange County look too bad.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so our teens like to party down and head for the beach. Who can't
relate to that? I know I do.</TE>
<TE>   Totally.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles officials told a group of Granada Hills residents on
Friday to open voting in elections for a proposed neighborhood council to
people who work in the area, as well as residents, even if it means
including employees of a controversial landfill.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute caused city officials to recommend a postponement on
certification of the Granada Hills Neighborhood Council, which had been
scheduled for Tuesday. Officials said they will not certify the council
unless the bylaws are changed.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Nelson, administrator of the city Department of Neighborhood
Empowerment, said the City Charter is clear on the matter.</LD>
<TE>   "The City Charter very clearly says that stakeholders include anyone
who lives, works or owns property in the area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Edwards, a council organizer and longtime foe of the
controversial Sunshine Canyon Landfill, said she disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel it would undermine our neighborhood council," she said. "This
is supposed to provide parity for the neighborhoods. Business does not
need more representation at City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the North Valley Coalition, who for years have fought an
expansion of the landfill, are helping organize the 19-member
neighborhood council, which would advise city leaders on local issues.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers have proposed that each business receive one vote in
council elections, but that employees of firms not get individual votes.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards fears changing the bylaws might allow Browning Ferris
Industries, which operates the dump, to bus in employees for the election
in a bid to stack the neighborhood council with pro-landfill members.</TE>
<TE>   A BFI spokesman said the firm would like to participate in the
neighborhood council, but has no plans to try to take control.</TE>
<TE>   "That is paranoia at best," said Arnie Berghoff, a spokesman for the
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Berghoff said the Los Angeles City Council in 1999 voted to give BFI
permission to expand the Sunshine Canyon Landfill into Granada Hills.</TE>

<HD>Arts Community Memorializes a Leading Light</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Naomi Vine, the Orange County Museum of Art's founding
director, was a 'rare commodity.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a traditional Catholic memorial service filled with hymns,
incense and sunlight beaming through stained-glass windows, friends and
relatives of Naomi Vine paid tribute Friday to the Orange County Museum
of Art's founding director, who died of cancer on Christmas Eve.</LD>
<LD>   A Mass, led by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony at St. Barnabas Church in Long
Beach, celebrated the life of the 52-year-old Vine, who was remembered as
a tough-minded professional who led two of Orange County's most prominent
museums through troubled times. She also was a recently baptized Catholic
and a devoted mother, Mahony said.</LD>
<LD>   "The people who didn't know her misunderstood her," said Los Angeles
artist Peter Alexander, who met Vine when he was a board member and she
had started her tumultuous days as director at the Laguna Art Museum in
1995. She became founding director of the Orange County Museum of Art in
1996.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 300 who attended the service were leaders of Orange County's
arts community. Some were moved to tears as they listened to eulogies
detailing Vine's recent conversion to Catholicism, her decision to adopt
a child and her battle with cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm going to die, my dying wish is: You have to love Victor as
much as you love me," Vine told husband Albert Milano on learning that
her illness was terminal. It was Vine who persuaded her husband to adopt
their Cambodian-born son Victor, now 11, after she learned that she could
not have a child.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to come home at night and have someone call her 'Mom,' "
said Milano, who carried Vine's ashes to the front of the church in a
black urn.</TE>
<TE>   Vine met Milano in 1994. He was drawn to her "fabulous smile." "She
was my inspiration," he said. Shortly after, she fought her first bout
with cancer. Her illness returned in September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   She and Milano moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1995 so she could
"realize her life's dream of directing a museum of art."Milano found work
as a fund-raising consultant, joining Mahony's capital campaign to build
the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Vine's wish is to be interred in
the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "She was on the Catholic fast track," said Msgr. John P. Twomey in one
of the ceremony's lighter moments. He said Vine became a Catholic last
April and met the pope in July. Despite her busy schedule, she made time
to go to weekday Mass at 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "She had three great loves: Love of God, love of family and love of
art."</TE>
<TE>   Her last love put her at the center of a controversial merger attempt
between the Laguna Art Museum and the former Newport Harbor Art Museum in
1996, which eventually created the Orange County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Vine dealt with face-to-face confrontations, slashed tires, even death
threats.</TE>
<TE>   But she stood firm, Milano said, "Instead of expressing fear, she
would remark to me how thrilled she was that people were taking art that
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   OCMA board Chairman Darrel Anderson called Vine's death a "very
personal loss."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of the people who convinced Naomi to come to California eight
years ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Her death leaves a tremendous void that we are not prepared for. She
was an important manager, fiscally responsible, and in an arts
organization, that's a rare commodity."</TE>
<TE>   "She was one of the great artistic visionaries in our community and
she was also a very spiritual, loving, caring human being," said John
Forsyte, president of the Pacific Symphony Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The black cube that contains her ashes is a nod to her 1989 doctoral
dissertation in art history for the University of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   It represents the works of one of her favorite abstract painters, Ad
Reinhardt, who was known for his muted black square canvases containing
barely discernible crosses.</TE>
<TE>   Milano paraphrased the ideals of the artist as Vine wrote about them:
"Reinhardt believed art always expressed that the human spirit can be
united with all being and nonbeing in a state of perfect harmony and
eternal peace."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's insight into Vine's love of art and her spiritual journey was
stated more simply: "Art is a reflected part of God's creation. Now she
beholds beauty like none of us can ever imagine."</TE>

<LD>Hope this doesn't throw cold water on the romance: The Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise's police log reported that "a woman was pounding on her
boyfriend's front door with a lawn sprinkler."</LD>
<LD>   From Russia with menu concerns: "I've been entertaining a friend from
Moscow who informed me that virtually her whole concept of L.A. has come
from reading your Only in L.A. column in her homeland (through the
Internet)!" says writer Tom Greene of L.A.</LD>
<LD>   "The title 'Only,' in Russian, according to her, translates as 'The
Absolute Truth.' So she takes everything you say as Gospel."</LD>
<TE>   Greene said his friend, Anya Zontova, was taken aback to find that
restaurants here are much less "adventurous" than my menu items had
indicated. But then he took her to a Hollywood reception at a ritzy
eatery where she became a bit nervous over a nearby sign.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her in my very bad Russian, 'Not to worry--at least restaurant
supplies nearby emergency treatment!' " Greene quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, the story has a happy ending. Zontova not only ate there
without incident, but felt well enough to snap a shot of the sign (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   Now that's scary! Ex-Pasadenan Peter Jacobson went into a Sacramento
restaurant and found a display of Pepto Bismol coupons available. "First
Aid for heartburn, diarrhea, nausea, indigestion and upset stomach," the
display said. "Next time, think pink." Jacobson's reaction: "There won't
be a next time."</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Speaking of food establishments (see
accompanying), Dan Fink of L.A. found a place that evidently specializes
in baked chicken. Richard Zigrang came upon a store that doesn't know the
meaning of big. And Sandra Walker of Temple City isn't sure if a seller
of a barbecue-type set is just blowing smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Lost Angels: The Arizona Diamondbacks won a World Series in their
fourth year, while the Anaheim Angels have never even made it into the
fall classic in 40 years. Steve Koenig wonders if the Angels' problem
might be disorientation.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he points out, this is a team that has played in two cities
(L.A. and Anaheim), has had three names (L.A., California, Anaheim), and
has played in three ballparks (Wrigley Field, Dodger Stadium and Edison
International Field; four, if you count Edison in its former life as
Anaheim Stadium).</TE>
<TE>   And, as if all that isn't dizzying enough, the team just announced its
sixth uniform change. The team, by the way, has never won any fashion
awards, though I'm surprised that Mr. Blackwell didn't take note of the
just-abandoned ensemble that featured periwinkle (blue/purple) stripes
and a logo being propelled by angel wings.</TE>
<TE>   Almost enough to make you think pink.</TE>

<HD>Controversial Novel Returns to Library</HD>
<DH>Censorship: District says the principal took 'Sophie's Choice' to
review it after a parent complained. The ACLU had threatened a lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three months after the William Styron novel "Sophie's Choice"
disappeared from library shelves at La Mirada High School amid arguments
over possible censorship, the book is back.</LD>
<LD>   It returned this week with a message from the school district.</LD>
<LD>   "We are definitely not into censorship," said Ginger Shattuck,
superintendent of Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School district.</LD>
<TE>   Students had said the book about a traumatized Holocaust survivor was
pulled from the library after a parent learned it was on a teacher's
recommended reading list. The parent had objected to parts of the book
that contained profanity and some sexual content.</TE>
<TE>   The matter attracted the attention of the American Civil Liberties
Union, which threatened a 1st Amendment lawsuit if the book was not
returned.</TE>
<TE>   La Mirada Principal Andrew Huynh deferred comment Friday to the
district superintendent. Shattuck said the book was not pulled as an act
of censorship, but was borrowed by the principal--admittedly, for longer
than was needed--to review it for possible inclusion in the curriculum.
Huynh was prompted by the parent's concern and took the school's one copy
of the book, Shattuck said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who want to incorporate books into their curriculum that
aren't already approved by the state must submit an application to the
district. A committee from the district reviews the book.</TE>
<TE>   But the managing attorney for the ACLU of Southern California disputed
Shattuck's account. "I don't see why it would need to be off the shelves
for a couple months," said Peter Eliasberg. "I just don't buy that
story."</TE>
<TE>   Eliasberg said he believes the book is back in the library because
district officials got some good advice from their attorneys--and
realized they was in the wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed that this ever happened, but at the same point, I'm
glad it could be resolved so quickly, without [the district] dragging its
feet and forcing us to litigation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sophie's Choice" chronicles the postwar life of Sophie, a Polish
refugee whose sufferings in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp are
revealed in flashbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Kat Kosmala, a senior at La Mirada High who was among those who
protested the book's removal, said she was overjoyed by its return. She
said the book belongs in an environment where young people can easily get
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is a wonderful book on many levels," she said. "It has a
great deal of literary merit, historical and cultural value."</TE>
<TE>   Kosmala, 18, hopes the controversy surrounding "Sophie's Choice"
attracts more students to it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's now become a little more famous than before. I hope most of them
read it at some point," she said.</TE>

<HD>Indian Americans Will Honor a Hero</HD>
<DH>Tribute: Cerritos gathering will pay homage to the late Dalip Singh
Saund, who served three terms in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indian Americans from across the nation will converge Sunday on
Cerritos to pay belated tribute to their long-forgotten hero: the late
Dalip Singh Saund, the first Asian American member of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Though few remember or know it, India-born Saund, a Sikh who earned a
PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley in 1924, made history in 1956 when he
was elected to Congress from the 29th District, which included Riverside
and Imperial counties. He died in 1973 at age 73.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a great man who is an inspiration not only to 1.7 million
Indian Americans, but to us all," said Inder Singh, president-elect of
the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin and an organizer of
the event marking the 45th anniversary of Saund's swearing in.</LD>
<TE>   The initiative to honor the long-forgotten "congressman from India,"
as Saund referred to himself in his autobiography, started on what would
have been his 100th birthday two years ago when Singh wrote an article
that appeared in Indian newspapers across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In this post-Sept. 11 era, when some people of Indian ancestry have
been targets of harassment because of their appearance, it is doubly
important that Saund's legacy be shared with other Americans, Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   An admirer of Abraham Lincoln, Saund persuaded his reluctant family to
send him to America for advance studies in 1920. Within four years of his
arrival, he had completed a master's degree and doctorate in mathematics,
but he couldn't find work in his field because of discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   So, like many of his countrymen, Saund became a farmer instead,
settling in the Imperial Valley. He began participating in civic affairs
and Democratic politics when anti-Asian exclusion laws barred him from
gaining citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   He led a nationwide campaign that won his people the right to
naturalize in 1946. He became a citizen in 1949 and was elected a justice
of the peace in Westmoreland, a town just south of the Salton Sea, in
1950.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, Saund, by then a prosperous businessman, was elected chairman
of the Imperial County Democratic Central Committee and a member of the
state Democratic Executive Committee. He was elected to Congress in 1956
and served three terms. A stroke debilitated him in 1962 as he sought a
fourth term.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's event at the Cerritos Sheraton Hotel will include a seminar
on the Indian diaspora, a screening of "Roots in the Sand," a documentary
on early immigrants, and a banquet, where state lawmakers of Indian
ancestry from Maryland, New Jersey and Minnesota will speak. The seminar,
which begins at 2 p.m., and the film, which follows it, are free.</TE>
<TE>   Singh, a retired computer scientist from Tarzana, and Jayasri Hart,
producer of the documentary chronicling the struggles of Punjabi Sikhs in
California, hope the occasion will also awaken Indian Americans to their
century-old American heritage, which began in 1907, when Sikhs from
Punjab first came to the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Since he was the first Asian American person to be elected to
Congress, it's the perfect person to organize around," Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their numbers, education and wealth, Indian Americans have
wielded less political power than other Asian immigrant groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Indians lagged behind because they were mostly professionals" who
tended to be focused on their careers and kept to themselves, Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   Indians also went through identity problems in this country because,
although the Census Bureau considered them Caucasians, white society
refused to accept them as members.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at a crossroads in establishing our identity," said Hart,
whose grandfather came to study in the United States at the turn of the
20th century.</TE>
<TE>   With the advent of the Internet, Indians living outside
India--numbering 18 million worldwide--are connecting more.</TE>
<TE>   "Until the Internet, we never met except when we went back to the
homeland," Hart said. "The first generation who stayed here dreamed of
the past, and the new generation had no past to dream of."</TE>

<HD>Bank Heists Drop Sharply Over 9-Year Period, FBI Says</HD>
<DH>Crime: L.A. area data, however, show a rise in violent encounters
between robbers and customers, employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of bank robberies has sharply declined in Los Angeles
and neighboring counties in the last nine years, the FBI reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But assaults against bank customers and employees have increased, said
John H. McEachern, supervisory special agent for bank robberies in the
Los Angeles area.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the number of such violent acts in 2001, at 49, was the
highest for any year in records compiled since 1993. The counties in
question are Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino,
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.</LD>
<TE>   McEachern said the number of bank robberies in those counties, 677,
was considerably less than half the 1993 total of 1,674.</TE>
<TE>   Most such crimes are not only nonviolent, they also occur so quietly
that few bank customers or employees notice, the FBI agent said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 677 robberies in 2001, 205 were of the "takeover" variety, in
which the robber or robbers make such a display that everyone in the bank
is aware of what is happening.</TE>
<TE>   McEachern called this a disturbing number and said it has risen as
what he terms "master planners" recruit gang members to rob banks with
stolen cars, masks and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The number of takeover robberies ranged from 154 in 1998 to 144 in
1999 to 156 in 2000, he said, before spiking to 205 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Most violent robberies do not include the use of guns, the FBI said,
citing the effects of the relatively new use-a-gun-go-to-prison laws.
Other kinds of assaults, with knives or fists, are more common.</TE>
<TE>   The number of customers and employees shot in the last seven years in
the seven-county region totals only 17, McEachern said, and just four of
those have been in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   But over that period, from 1998 through 2001, the number of assaults
and individual robberies of employees and customers has risen from 20 in
1998 to 31 in 1999, 40 in 2000 and 49 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   By county, the lion's share of all bank robberies occurs in the most
populous: Los Angeles and Orange. In 2001, there were 397 bank robberies
in Los Angeles County, 128 in Orange, 54 in San Bernardino, 52 in
Riverside, 30 in Ventura, 14 in Santa Barbara and two in San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   The all-time record for bank robberies in the seven-county area was in
1992, when 2,641 occurred, amounting to an average of one every 42
minutes each banking day, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   However, even with the decline since then, the number last year still
makes the Los Angeles region the national leader for bank robberies,
McEachern said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Halts Dredging in Ballona Wetlands</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has ordered work stopped on a city project that involves
dredging the Grand Canal area of the contentious Ballona wetlands.</LD>
<LD>   The order, by a San Francisco Superior Court judge, came two days
after the Wetlands Action Network filed a lawsuit against the city and
the San Francisco-based California Coastal Commission, which approved the
project in November.</LD>
<LD>   The group contends the project would wipe out fish and marine
invertebrates in the canal.</LD>
<TE>   Work could resume late next week, when the court is scheduled to
consider whether to extend the work stoppage with a preliminary
injunction.</TE>
<TE>   The project would clean and partially grade the 2,000-foot-long Grand
Canal, the remnants of a tidal lagoon near Los Angeles' Venice Canals.
They underwent renovations of their own a decade ago.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Attempt to Void Approval of Sand, Gravel Mine</HD>
<DH>Environment: Ruling allows the Board of Supervisors to impose
mitigating measures at next month's vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An administrative judge for the U.S. Interior Department has
rejected a legal challenge to the federal government's endorsement of a
massive mining project near Santa Clarita.</LD>
<LD>   The decision issued Tuesday is a setback for the city of Santa Clarita
and other opponents of the Transit Mixed Concrete Co. mine, which is
designed to extract 78 million tons of sand and gravel from federal land
in Soledad Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clarita spokesman Jason Smisko said the city is now resigned to
the fact that the mine will be built and is working on ways to reduce its
impact on the city.</LD>
<TE>   "We're disappointed, but we're not disheartened," he said. "In an
effort like this, you prepare yourself for some setbacks."</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the 460-acre
mining project at a Feb. 26 hearing. Federal officials say the board
cannot stop the mine, but can impose reasonable mitigating measures to
protect the environment.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management gave Transit Mixed
Concrete--a subsidiary of Mexican concrete giant Cemex--the right to
operate the mine.</TE>
<TE>Measures to Protect Endangered Toad</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita, the Sierra Club and other groups, in a lengthy appeal
to the Department of Interior, argued that the BLM did not adequately
study the mine's possible effects on air quality, water supplies and
endangered species in the area.</TE>
<TE>   In a 26-page decision, Administrative Judge C. Randall Grant rejected
nearly all of those charges. Grant did say that the BLM approval should
include measures to protect the endangered arroyo toad, which was found
in the Santa Clara River last year.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials had determined that the mine would not harm the toad
or an inch-long fish called the unarmored three-spine stickleback if
river levels are monitored.</TE>
<TE>   Cemex spokesman Brian Mastin said the Interior Department ruling shows
that the company has thoroughly complied with all environmental
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "The city raised every issue they could imagine and we had to respond
to all of those things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Prosser, attorney for the mine opponents, said Friday that she
had not read the decision. She added that her clients have the option of
refiling the suit in federal district court.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Officer Tipped Off Drug Suspect</HD>
<DH>Courts: Task force member sought money before major bust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Ontario police officer assigned to a federal drug task
force pleaded guilty last July to tipping off a suspect in a narcotics
investigation that resulted in more than 100 arrests nationwide, the U.S.
attorney's office disclosed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The case against Douglas John Bos, 34, was filed under seal so as not
to further damage the investigation, which ended Thursday with the
arrests of suspects in 12 cities, including Los Angeles, Riverside and
Fresno, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects are accused of smuggling tons of pseudoephedrine, used to
make methamphetamine, from Canada to California.</LD>
<TE>   Among those apprehended in the three-year probe was the man Bos was
accused of tipping off, Nidal Hamayel, 45, of Moreno Valley.</TE>
<TE>   According to a court document unsealed late Thursday, Bos was part of
a six-member law enforcement team that was using a confidential informant
to buy pseudoephedrine from Hamayel.</TE>
<TE>   The informant, fitted with a concealed transmitter, was to meet with
Hamayel on Oct. 28, 2000, the document said. On the morning before the
meeting, Bos allegedly telephoned Hamayel, warned him about the informant
and asked for money.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Rebecca S. Lonergan said that Hamayel met the
government informant anyway and confronted him, saying his cover had been
blown by a drug agent assigned to the case.</TE>
<TE>   The Drug Enforcement Administration launched an investigation, aided
by the FBI, the IRS and the Ontario Police Department, which Bos joined
in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Bos, who lives in Canyon Lake, admitted in a plea agreement that he
telephoned Hamayel on three dates before the Oct. 28 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Bos faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is
sentenced Jan. 28 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Bos' defense lawyer, Edward Robinson, said his client made the
solicitation at a time "when he was going through a dreadful emotional
crisis." He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Bos remains free on $50,000 bond.</TE>

<HD>$345,000 Stolen From Back Seats of 2 Vehicles</HD>
<DH>Crime: A reward is offered for return of money stolen while men
were at lunch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thieves got $345,000 left on the back seats of two vehicles in the
Exposition Park area while the owners ate lunch nearby, police said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Moreno, owner of a Los Angeles check-cashing business who
usually hired an armored truck to carry money to work, decided to break
with routine on Jan. 5 and carry it himself along with an employee,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   After taking the money out of the bank, the two stopped at Panda
Express on Figueroa Street, said Det. Ted Williams of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Southwest Division.</LD>
<TE>   Moreno parked on the street and his employee parked in the
restaurant's lot. Moreno's Mercedes-Benz had about $150,000 in a bag on
the back seat. The employee had a bag with about $195,000 on the back
seat of a Nissan Xterra.</TE>
<TE>   When they returned after about half an hour at 2:30 p.m., they found
the windows smashed and the money gone.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Moreno's brother Oscar announced a $10,000 reward plus 10%
of any money recovered for information leading to the thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives and Oscar Moreno declined to say why Victor Moreno decided
to transport the money and why it was left in the vehicles. "It wasn't a
normal procedure. It was a one-shot deal," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call Williams at (213) 485-6777
during business hours or the LAPD's 24-hour hotline at (877) 529-3855.</TE>

<HD>Death Penalty Sought in Killing of College Student</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutors allege an unemployed Simi Valley man shot and
attempted to rape Megan Barroso in July. He faces trial March 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against an unemployed
carpenter accused of killing and attempting to rape a Moorpark College
student, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Vincent Henry Sanchez of Simi Valley faces a March 11 trial for
allegedly shooting Megan Barroso as she drove home from a party,
kidnapping her from her car and then trying to rape her, Chief Deputy
Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth said.</LD>
<LD>   The kidnapping and attempted rape charges make him eligible for the
death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez, 31, already has pleaded guilty to rape, burglary and assault
charges in connection with a series of attacks in Simi Valley. But he
pleaded not guilty to other charges related to those crimes, including
carjacking, sexual assault and kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to be tried on those charges at the same time he is
tried for Barroso's death.</TE>
<TE>   Art Barroso, Megan's father, said prosecutors made the right decision
in seeking the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I dread it but logically I cannot think of them not pursuing it,"
Barroso said. "It is good news for me. It is what we were looking for,
and I have faith in the prosecutors."</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn, Sanchez's attorney,
called the decision to seek the death penalty "a disgrace."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said prosecutors should have accepted an earlier plea by Sanchez
and avoided a lengthy trial that could force rape victims to testify.</TE>
<TE>Sanchez Faces Multiple Life Sentences</TE>
<TE>   In October, Sanchez pleaded guilty to 59 counts related to those
crimes. For those crimes alone, he was facing multiple life sentences. He
also offered a guilty plea in Barroso's death but prosecutors rejected
it, saying they would not accept anything less than a plea to
first-degree premeditated murder with special circumstances. Such a plea
would have made him a candidate for capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to kill him, and the only way they can kill him is to prove
that he raped her," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe Sanchez accosted Barroso in the early morning of
July 5. Her bullet-riddled rental car was found later that morning under
a freeway overpass.</TE>
<TE>   A month later her decomposed body was found by a search team at the
bottom of a ravine off Black Canyon Road in the foothills south of Simi
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez was arrested July 27 on suspicion of burglarizing a neighbor's
Simi Valley home.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence collected at his house led officers to arrest him in
Barroso's killing as well as a series of sexual assaults in Simi Valley
dating back five years.</TE>
<TE>   Transcripts from testimony before the Ventura County Grand Jury
detailed a crime spree that became increasingly violent and allegedly
culminated with the killing of Barroso.</TE>
<TE>   According to the transcripts, Sanchez threatened to kill his victims'
relatives if the victims did not comply with his demands. During the
assaults, he allegedly collected underwear and jewelry from his victims
and videotaped them during sexual acts.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez could be executed if a jury accepts the prosecution's
contention that he killed Barroso during an attempted rape.</TE>

<LD>A school bus struck and killed a 4-year-old boy Friday when he
apparently fell from his bicycle into its path.</LD>
<LD>   California Highway Patrol spokesman Greg Williams said it appeared
that the boy, whom the county coroner identified as Sergio Lara, may have
fallen just as the bus was pulling away from a stop at about 2:40 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "It's completely an accident," Williams said. "The bus driver never
saw the child and would have never known the child was there."</LD>

<HD>Man Jailed 2 Years Sees Case Voided</HD>
<DH>Courts: Authorities believe someone else committed robbery for
which he was imprisoned. D.A., challenger disagree on the review process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Friday dismissed charges against a man who spent two
years in prison for a robbery authorities now believe someone else
committed--prompting a candidate for Orange County district attorney to
propose an examination of recent wrongful convictions.</LD>
<LD>   George Lopez's case marks the fifth instance in two years in which
charges have been dropped against people convicted of robberies in the
county. The cases turned on eyewitness testimony that ultimately proved
unreliable.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez, 19, was serving a 13-year sentence for the armed robbery of an
Anaheim loan office when questions about his conviction began to surface.
First, two victims of the crime stepped forward to profess his innocence.
Last summer, another man told The Times that he, not Lopez, committed the
crime.</LD>
<TE>   Wally Wade, a veteran prosecutor running for district attorney, said
the office should take a hard look at all five cases, then use lessons
learned to train prosecutors and police in how to prevent wrongful
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason you analyze the past is to learn from it. I think these
cases would be good examples," Wade said. "There are too many of these
cases. I have no doubt the prosecutors and police are acting in good
faith. But good faith doesn't get a man a year or 20 years of his life
back."</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, who is seeking reelection, said his staff
acted prudently in the Lopez case, agreeing to dismiss it this week after
the office's investigation cast doubt on Lopez's guilt. He said Wade's
suggested remedies are unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Our prosecutors train about eyewitness cases all the time,"
Rackauckas said. "This is not anything new. . . . He just sees this as an
opportunity to try to help his campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said that in 2000 he teamed with Public Defender Carl
Holmes to launch a first-of-its-kind innocence project that will
investigate prisoners' claims of wrongful convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason these people are being released is we have an attitude if
someone's not guilty, we're going to let them out," Rackauckas said. "I
didn't see that under the past administration."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez spent more than two years in custody before a judge ordered his
release in September as questions about his guilt mounted. Lopez left the
Santa Ana courthouse Friday hand in hand with his wife, saying he hopes
that the dismissal of the case will help him find a job.</TE>
<TE>   He said no one should have to go through what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my job. All the money I'd saved for an apartment and wedding
went to pay the lawyer," Lopez said. "This can't keep happening. They're
playing with people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Wade said he questioned Rackauckas' handling of the Lopez case,
faulting the district attorney for not ordering an investigation when
questions about the conviction first surfaced more than a year ago. He
also said Rackauckas has a duty to examine what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to analyze why this is happening, because it shouldn't be,"
Wade said. "Police officers and D.A.s cringe at the idea that an innocent
person is going to be convicted. So for this many to have been wrongly
convicted is disturbing to everyone in law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   The five recent wrongful convictions in Orange County had some common
threads. All involved armed robberies, and the convictions were based in
large part on the testimony of victims.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists have reported for many years that such testimony can be
unreliable. Wade said prosecutors need to make sure they take additional
caution in dealing with those cases.</TE>
<TE>   "All jurors receive special instructions in cases involving eyewitness
testimony. Prosecutors should also receive specialized training on
evaluating eyewitness testimony," Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Giannini, director of the Orange County alternate defender's
office, agreed that a new approach to eyewitness testimony is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone in this business, we know the most unreliable evidence is
eyewitness evidence," he said. "When it's a total stranger who's robbing
you and you're under stress, the reliability goes way down."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said his big concern now is providing for his family and raising
the money to have a traditional wedding. He and his wife, Leah, were
married by Judge Daniel Didier moments after his sentencing in 2000. It
was Didier who dismissed the case Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I remember from our wedding day is he had to sign the
wedding certificate, and I could hear the handcuffs hitting the table,"
Leah Lopez said.</TE>

<HD>Service Honors Museum Official Naomi Vine</HD>
<DH>Rite: She is remembered as a tough-minded professional who steered
institutions through difficult times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a traditional Catholic memorial service filled with hymns,
incense and sunlight beaming through stained-glass windows, friends and
relatives of Naomi Vine paid tribute Friday to the Orange County Museum
of Art's founding director, who died of cancer on Christmas Eve.</LD>
<LD>   A Mass led by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony at St. Barnabas Church in Long
Beach celebrated the life of the 52-year-old Vine, who was remembered as
a tough-minded professional who led two of Orange County's most prominent
museums through troubled times. She also was a recently baptized Catholic
and a devoted mother, Mahony said.</LD>
<LD>   "The people who didn't know her misunderstood her," said Los Angeles
artist Peter Alexander, who met Vine when he was a board member and she
had started her tumultuous days as director at the Laguna Art Museum in
1995. She became founding director of the Orange County Museum of Art in
1996.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 300 who attended the service were leaders of Orange County's
arts community. Some were moved to tears as they listened to eulogies
detailing Vine's recent conversion to Catholicism, her decision to adopt
a child and her battle with cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm going to die, my dying wish is: You have to love Victor as
much as you love me," Vine told her husband, Albert Milano, on learning
that her illness was terminal. It was Vine who persuaded her husband they
should adopt Cambodian-born Victor, now 11, after she learned that she
could not have a child.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to come home at night and have someone call her 'Mom,' "
said Milano, who carried Vine's ashes to the front of the church in a
black urn.</TE>
<TE>   Vine met Milano in 1994. He was drawn to her fabulous smile, he said.
"She was my inspiration," he said. Shortly after, she fought her first
bout with cancer. The illness returned in September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   She and Milano moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1995 so she could
realize her dream of directing a museum of art. Milano found work as a
fund-raising consultant, joining Mahony's capital campaign to build the
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Vine's wish is to be interred in the
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "She was on the Catholic fast-track," said Msgr. John P. Twomey in one
of the ceremony's lighter moments. He said Vine became a Catholic last
April and met the pope in July. Despite her busy schedule, she made time
to go to weekday Mass at 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "She had three great loves: Love of God, love of family and love of
art."</TE>
<TE>   The black cube that contains her ashes is a nod to her 1989
dissertation in art history. It represents the works of abstract painter
Ad Reinhardt, who was known for his muted black square canvases
containing barely discernible crosses.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's insight into Vine's love of art and her spiritual journey was
stated simply: "Art is a reflected part of God's creation. Now she
beholds beauty like none of us can ever imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Ann Conway contributed to this report.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 12-year-old Texas boy who stands accused of starting a brush fire
that destroyed six homes this summer in San Clemente pleaded innocent
Friday during an arraignment in Juvenile Court.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was released into his father's custody and will return to his
home in El Paso. He must appear in Orange County for a hearing on Feb. 8.</LD>
<LD>   The boy faces three counts of arson of an inhabited structure and one
count of arson of a forest. The charges include enhancements of
destroying property worth more than $2.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   The charges stem from an Aug. 1 fire that raged through Trafalgar
Canyon and caused $4 million in property damage.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the boy was tossing matches into brush at the bottom
of the canyon because he wanted to see a fire grow.</TE>

<HD>Condit Takes Reelection Bid to Constituents</HD>
<DH>Politics: Intern Chandra Levy's disappearance draws scant mention
at the forum. The congressman's top opponent doesn't attend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>MERCED, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>'I'm Gary Condit. I'm from Ceres. I've represented the valley for
over 30 years.'</LD>
<LD>   With that, the beleaguered congressman faced a hometown crowd Friday
for the first time since his name became a tabloid staple and his career
spun into political infamy.</LD>
<LD>   It was a gentle audience at a Chamber of Commerce political forum,
which drew more than 150 guests, 13 television cameras and nine
candidates seeking to replace the incumbent-all but his most serious
Democratic opponent.</LD>
<TE>   The name Chandra Levy was never spoken. Indeed, the whole matter of
the missing intern went unmentioned throughout the 90-minute campaign
forum, until practically the end.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Bill Conrad, a Modesto councilman and Republican candidate
for Condit's seat, burst out: "Gentleman and ladies! I have a 15-year-old
son and Gary Condit should not be in Congress. He's an embarrassment.
What he has done this summer with his attitudes and the things that have
happened, he's just like Clinton. He shouldn't be there He's the wrong
man [in] the wrong place and this is about family values.'</TE>
<TE>   Condit, far from Conrad at the end of a long table, gulped from a
glass of water. He found a friendly face in the crowd and smiled, as
scattered boos and hisses nearly drowned out Conrad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's what you're going to run into in the valley," Condit's
son and campaign manager, Chad, said afterward. "I think people are fair.
They want to hear everyone and they're going to evaluate and judge for
themselves.'</TE>
<TE>   Condit, a 13-year veteran of Congress, was a shoo-in for reelection
until Levy disappeared last spring. Now, abandoned by Democratic Party
leaders and scrapping for campaign contributions, he is struggling as the
March 5 primary approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the 24-year-old intern have said she and the 53-year-old
Condit were having an affair. Condit, who is married, has refused to
discuss details of their relationship, other than to say they were close.
Police have said he is not a suspect in her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, Condit has given a series of media interviews,
and last summer he sent a letter to his Central Valley constituents
denying any involvement in Levy's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   But the event Friday marked the first time that Condit has stood
before his Central Valley constituents in such a forum.</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, the organizers allowed each candidate just a single
question-Condit's was about education reform-under a format that treated
all 10 candidates as equals, including two who do not live in the
district and one who used his opening remarks to sing an a cappella
version of Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the U.S.A.'</TE>
<TE>   The front-runner for the 18th Congressional District seat, Democratic
state Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, begged off the event, citing a
scheduling conflict. But he promised to attend a candidate's debate
scheduled for next month.</TE>
<TE>   That left Condit even more alone as the focus of Friday's candidate
forum.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a blue shirt, burgundy tie and a suit that matched his
steel-gray hair, Condit slipped into the Branding Iron steakhouse through
a back door, arriving late and avoiding the media. He moved briskly
through the banquet room, up and down the long rows of tables, shaking
nearly every hand before sitting down.</TE>
<TE>   The questions posed to the various candidates were screened by the
Chamber of Commerce, so it was unclear who-if anyone-was interested in
plumbing the depths of the Levy scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Several in the audience professed to be sick of the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody here is looking for any more gossip or any more
dirt than has already been slung," said Ed Anderson, 49, a commercial
loan officer at the local Community Bank and who is undecided in the
congressional race. "We just need to weigh all that stuff against the
good that [Condit] has done for the district.'</TE>
<TE>   Doug Fluetsch, 31, said afterward he was pleased that so many in the
audience hooted down Conrad when he interjected the Levy matter into the
forum.</TE>
<TE>   "People are sick of hearing about it," said Fluetsch, who is weighing
a vote for Condit or Republican state Sen. Dick Monteith of Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   "The stuff he did with the lady and all that is not right," Fluetsch
said. "But he has done a good job for the district.'</TE>
<TE>   Under the structure of the candidates forum, Condit was given the same
four minutes to speak as everyone else. As the incumbent, he spoke last.</TE>
<TE>   Condit repeatedly cited the bipartisan approach that has been a
hallmark of his time in Congress, as well as his years as a state
lawmaker in Sacramento. He spoke of the Central Valley as California's
perpetual underdog, overlooked and disrespected by the rest of the state.
When he came to his minute-long closing remark, he sounded almost
plaintive.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been effective on your behalf," Condit said. "And I'm going to
ask you: I've helped you. I'm asking you to help me.'</TE>
<TE>   That completed the forum. And as the other candidates mixed and
mingled with the crowd, Condit rose and slipped out a side door.</TE>

<HD>Simon Calls for Dumping New Programs to Help Ease the State's
Budget Shortfall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. on Friday called
for closing the state's budget shortfall by eliminating all recently
approved government programs. He criticized the plan proposed this week
by Gov. Gray Davis as relying upon "fiscal sleight-of-hand."</LD>
<LD>   Simon acknowledged that he may discover some new programs that deserve
to be spared once he has the chance to review the entire budget. But he
said eliminating new spending was only one of a dozen steps needed to
extract California from its projected $12.5-billion shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to the Public Policy Institute of California, Simon also
called for 6% of the state's annual budget to be set aside in coming
years to deal with tight times and natural disasters--a step that would
require even deeper cuts.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to make difficult choices now," said Simon, a Los Angeles
businessman and son of former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's comments are the latest by Republican challengers to Davis
criticizing the governor's budget, released this week. Secretary of State
Bill Jones and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan both have blamed
Davis for mishandling the state's energy crisis and for what they
consider overspending during flush years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to halting new programs, Simon proposed a 15%
across-the-board cut in all state operational spending, with exemptions
for public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he was advocating spending cuts, Simon also called for a
reduction in the state's capital-gains tax, long a popular cause among
Republicans and conservatives. Simon joined with some conservative
economists who argue that cutting capital-gains taxes helps spur
investment and thus generates revenue. Others question that assumption,
however, and say that such cuts are likely to reduce the money coming to
the government.</TE>
<TE>   Simon criticized Davis for relying on economic projections that may
not materialize and for failing to make the cuts needed to pull the state
out of its budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking for trouble with the sort of budget Gov. Davis has put
forward," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis campaign, said it was easy
for critics to question the governor's budget and to offer what he called
vague alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone can put together a wish list and throw it out there," Salazar
said. "But unless they've got the responsibility for implementation, as
Gov. Davis has, and unless they've got a track record of making things
happen, they should be careful about throwing stones."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he was spending so much time criticizing Davis' budget and
so little talking about how he differed from his opponents in the
upcoming Republican primary, Simon replied that Riordan had not put
forward a detailed budget proposal to analyze. Simon did not mention
Jones' budget plan.</TE>
<TE>   Jones campaign consultant Sean Walsh said Simon's plans show his
unfamiliarity with Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   If the state were to salt away cash reserves every year, Walsh said,
it would have a hard time justifying going into debt to do needed public
works projects. Walsh added that a 15% across-the-board cut would never
make it through the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows a fundamental non-understanding of how state politics and
policy works," Walsh said. "On the surface, it sounds good, but it's not
really sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has never run for elected office before, acknowledged that
many of his proposals would not be popular in Sacramento. But he said he
believes that, if elected, he could enact them.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not I've had legislative experience, I don't think is as
much of an issue as whether I have good ideas," Simon said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Henri Verneuil, 81, a prolific filmmaker who directed some of
France's greatest movie stars, died Friday, according to the French Fine
Arts Academy. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Verneuil directed such giants of the French cinema as Jean Gabin and
Jean-Paul Belmondo. Both appeared in Verneuil's 1962 film "Un Singe en
Hiver" (A Monkey in Winter).</LD>
<LD>   Born Achod Malakian in Rodosto, Turkey, Verneuil was a naturalized
French citizen of Armenian ancestry. After starting out as a journalist
and radio commentator, he began directing shorts in 1946 and turned to
features in the early 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   In 1991, he directed "Mayrig," a movie dealing with the Armenian
genocide and starring Omar Sharif and Claudia Cardinale.</TE>
<TE>   Among Verneuil's most memorable films is "La Vache et le Prisonnier"
(The Cow and I), a charming 1959 movie about a man's adventures with a
stubborn cow.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Verneuil was awarded an honorary Cesar, France's equivalent
of the Oscar, for lifetime achievement in film.</TE>

<HD>Bill McCutcheon, 77; Comedic Actor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill McCutcheon, a Tony Award-winning comedic character actor who
played the grandfatherly Uncle Wally for eight years on "Sesame Street,"
has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   McCutcheon, who lived in Mahwah, N.J., died Wednesday of natural
causes at a hospital in Ridgewood, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   In his nearly 40-year acting career, McCutcheon appeared in numerous
Broadway and off-Broadway shows, regional theater productions, television
programs, commercials and movies, including "Steel Magnolias," in which
he played Shirley MacLaine's husband. He even played Leo the Leprechaun
on "Howdy Doody.'</LD>
<TE>   His forte was comedy.</TE>
<TE>   He won an Obie Award in 1985 for his comedic portrayal of a stroke
victim in Christopher Durang's "Marriage of Bette and Boo" at the Public
Theater in New York. He also won the Tony for his role as a comic
gangster on the lam in a 1988 revival of "Anything Goes" at Lincoln
Center.</TE>
<TE>   He also earned three daytime Emmys for contributing to the Emmy
Award-winning "Sesame Street" program on PBS, on which he played the bow
tie- and cardigan-wearing Uncle Wally from 1984 to 1992, the year he
retired.</TE>
<TE>   "Uncle Wally was a fun-loving, down-to-earth, endearing older
gentleman," said Danette DeSena, "Sesame Street" talent producer. "That's
really how Bill was in real life.'</TE>
<TE>   "He was the sweetest man in the world and the funniest man I ever
worked with in a sketch," said Dom DeLuise, a longtime friend, who cast
McCutcheon as a regular on his 1968 comedy-variety show. "He was the best
of the best.'</TE>
<TE>   McCutcheon's impish face-and what he did with it-played a significant
role in his success as a comedic actor.</TE>
<TE>   In the revival of Cole Porter's Depression-era "Anything Goes," he
played Moonface Martin, Public Enemy No. 13, a gangster disguised as a
parson on a trans-Atlantic luxury liner.</TE>
<TE>   "To say he has a moon face," New York Times theater critic Frank Rich
wrote, "is to do the performer's priceless mug a disservice. His is a
moon face that might have been carved out of pink, quivering Jell-O, with
a bite taken out where the chin should be. Throw in a slow-burn comic
delivery that harks back to the vanished traditions of burlesque-not even
a dog's invasion of his trousers can excite Mr. McCutcheon-and you have
to wonder if even the fabled Victor Moore got more laughs in the role.'</TE>
<TE>   Born in Russell, Ky., McCutcheon formed a comedic Spike Jones-inspired
jazz band in high school. After serving in World War II, during which he
was wounded in Italy, he studied acting at Ohio University and started a
dance band.</TE>
<TE>   Moving to New York after graduating in 1948, he formed a jazz comedy
trio that played Catskill resorts and Manhattan jazz clubs. But his
interest was in acting, and he worked a variety of jobs to help make ends
meet between roles.</TE>
<TE>   While working as an usher at CBS in 1954, McCutcheon was asked to
appear on Edward R. Murrow's live "Person to Person" program, in which
the renowned journalist interviewed celebrities in their homes while he
sat in a comfortable chair in the CBS studios.</TE>
<TE>   In a unique program twist, Murrow interviewed McCutcheon and his wife,
Anne, in their humble Greenwich Village apartment-to contrast the life of
a struggling unknown with the enormously successful Arthur Godfrey.</TE>
<TE>   "Anne and I lived in one room. Godfrey had a palatial mansion in
Virginia," McCutcheon recalled in a 1988 interview. "When Murrow visited
us, I said, 'This is our library,' while pointing to the bookcase, and
'This is our guest room,' while pointing to our cot.'</TE>
<TE>   McCutcheon's unlikely appearance on the popular show was a turning
point in his career, generating interest from agents and landing him
roles in live productions on "Studio One" and "Armstrong Circle Theatre.'</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, McCutcheon is survived by a son, Jay, of
Baltimore; two daughters; Carol Crevani of Mahwah and Kenna Colley of
Blacksburg, Va.; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Moe Foner, a longtime union leader whose efforts to bring the arts
into workers' lives led to his status as the Sol Hurok of the labor
movement, died Thursday at his home in New York City. He was 86 and
suffered from heart problems and other ailments.</LD>
<LD>   Foner was for many years executive secretary of Local 1199, New York's
largest union of health-care workers. He was a key strategist in labor
battles four decades ago that paved the way for organizing hospital
workers in New York and across the country.</LD>
<LD>   His proudest legacy was the creation in 1979 of Bread and Roses, a
nonprofit cultural program with national reach that gives workers access
to the arts through lunchtime theater, music and poetry presentations,
films, concerts at Lincoln Center and exhibits at the only permanent art
gallery run by a union.</LD>
<TE>   Over several decades, he organized events with performers such as
Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Alan Alda and
Pete Seeger, often showcasing artists before they became stars. Through
Bread and Roses, he also helped union members find artistic outlets,
employing them as actors and authors of plays inspired by the dramas of
their daily lives.</TE>
<TE>   Dee, an actress and author, once said of Foner: "I've just not known
anybody else who is so richly aware of the benefits, the joys, the
necessity of arts to ordinary people.'</TE>
<TE>   "The idea behind Bread and Roses is to challenge the idea that culture
is elitist, somehow alien to working people," Foner said at a December
ceremony honoring him at the union's art gallery on West 43rd Street in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Foner was one of four brothers who were prominent on the American
left. Philip Foner was a leading labor historian; his twin, Jack, was the
author of many highly regarded books on African American history. The
youngest brother, Henry, became president of New York's furriers union.</TE>
<TE>   Morris "Moe" Foner was born Brooklyn, the son of Russian and Polish
immigrants. His father was a seltzer deliveryman and his mother was a
homemaker. As a teenager, Foner played saxophone in a swing band with his
brothers and met many musicians, actors and artists while performing at
Manhattan hotels and Borscht Belt retreats.</TE>
<TE>   He worked for several unions before becoming education and cultural
director for Local 1199 in 1952, when it represented pharmacy employees.
The union expanded its scope several years later when it sustained two
long strikes and won the right to represent orderlies, laundresses and
other low-paid, largely minority workers in New York hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Foner was instrumental in winning the support of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. in the union's fight, and the two became allies in civil
rights battles of the 1960s. In the 1970s, he helped mobilize labor
against the Vietnam War and landed on President Richard Nixon's enemies
list.</TE>
<TE>   He lost the position of executive secretary in a power struggle in the
early 1980s and focused his attention on Bread and Roses. The
organization ran workshops for union members that resulted in a 1980
musical about hospital workers called "Take Care" that was seen by 35,000
people in 11 states.</TE>
<TE>   "He was incredibly proud of his work in creating a bridge between the
labor movement and intellectuals and the arts and cultural community,"
said Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199/SEIU of the New York Health
and Human Service Union, which has more than 200,000 members in New York,
New Jersey and Florida. "He was a man who read a lot and who felt
comfortable with poor people who had not had [the same] opportunity. He
could debate philosophy with intellectuals, or hang out with artists in a
bohemian setting.'</TE>
<TE>   One of Foner's last projects was a poster series called "Women of
Hope" that celebrates African American, Native American, Asian American
and Latina women, including Maya Angelou, Dolores Huerta and Maxine Hong
Kingston. Thousands of the posters have been circulated across the
country in schools, subways, airports and other public spaces. Foner
initiated the project after visits to schools made him aware that the
accomplishments of black women were rarely included in lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "His work has helped change the way that people think of themselves in
history," said Mary Marshall Clark, director of the Oral History Research
Office at Columbia University, which has preserved a series of lengthy
interviews with Foner. "In various conversations I've had in subways and
at meetings and private dinners with strong, activist women, they've all
said how moved they were by these posters.'</TE>
<TE>   Foner is survived by his wife, Anne; two daughters, Nancy and Peggy; a
granddaughter; and his brother Henry.</TE>

<LD>Social Distortion leader Mike Ness half apologized to the SRO
audience at House of Blues in Anaheim this week for letting another year
pass without a new album from the band.</LD>
<LD>   "I know we promised to have one out In 2001, but well...," Ness said
from the stage, smiling as he let the thought trail off. "We're going to
get something out in the spring."</LD>
<LD>   The veteran O.C. punk quartet previewed some songs scheduled for the
next Social D album, its first studio effort since "White Light White
Heal White Trash" in 1996. It will also be the first since Ness put the
band on hiatus while he put out two solo albums and went on a solo tour.</LD>
<TE>   The band, which has been in the studio, is recording for the first
time without rhythm guitarist Dennis Danell, who died of a brain aneurysm
two years ago and is the subject of "Don't Take Me for Granted," one of
three recent songs Social D played during six nights in Anaheim that
ended Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ness premiered that song at the May 2000 memorial concert for Danell.
Two newer numbers show the band is not slowing down more than 20 years
after forming. "I Wasn't Born to Follow" charts the band's commitment to
remaining outside the mainstream, and "Angels Wings" is Ness' exhortation
to fans, many of whom are now in the 20s, 30s and 40s with kids of their
own, to take their responsibilities as adults and parents seriously.</TE>
<TE>And the Orange County Grammy Nominees Are ...</TE>
<TE>   Orange County transplant Kim Wilson is among the nominees for the
Grammy for traditional blues album for his solo album "Smokin' Joint."
Among his competition: Maria Muldaur, James Blood Ulmer, a multi-artist
tribute to seminal blues man Robert Johnson, and, ironically, Jimmie
Vaughan, Wilson's former partner in the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Vaughan is
nominated for his latest solo effort, "Do You Get the Blues?"</TE>
<TE>   Former Orange County resident John Patitucci, jazz bassist
extraordinaire-turned-composer, is also vying for a Grammy, for
instrumental composition, for his piece "Communion."</TE>
<TE>   One more Grammy contender with an O.C. connection is Rage Against the
Machine, nominated in the hard-rock performance category for its song
"Renegades of Funk."</TE>
<TE>A Broad Range of Styles for the Folkies in Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   The Living Tradition folk series features a double bill Jan. 19, with
headliner Harvey Reid and L.A. based alt-folkie Claudia Russell.</TE>
<TE>   Multi-instrumentalist Reid takes the concept of one-man band in a
different direction, accompanying himself with a cadre of stringed
instruments, including guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, six-string banjo and
autoharp. He applies them to an equally wide range of styles, running
from folk, blues and country to Celtic, ragtime and classical music.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, a former member of the Life Is Grand Band and Maggie's Farm,
released her debut solo album, "Song Food," last year and recently was
selected new artist of the year by Boston radio station WUMB. She'll be
accompanied by her husband, guitarist-mandolinist Bruce Kaplan.</TE>
