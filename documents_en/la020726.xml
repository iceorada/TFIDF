<HD>Cameos Make a Comeback as Audiences Get the Inside Joke</HD>
<DH>Filmmakers show they know we know the score with a rash of
star surprises this summer.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cameos are mushrooming at the movies this summer, and nowhere do they
crop up in greater abundance than in "Austin Powers in Goldmember."
The film is the latest installment in the tongue-in-cheek spy
franchise built around a protagonist lifted from London's swinging
'60s, who has already oscillated his way through two blockbusters in
the last five years.</LD>
<LD>   Notable for its onslaught of pop culture references, the series
also is known for roping celebrities for blink-and-you-miss-them
appearances--Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello and Woody Harrelson have
done the honors in the past--but the current episode goes for broke.
A slew of bona fide Hollywood stars take turns in support of the
orthodontically challenged hero.</LD>
<LD>   Attentive moviegoers can attest to the roster of celebrities
whizzing through several recent films: Michael Jackson, Martha
Stewart and Peter Graves sashayed through "Men in Black II," while
John McEnroe, Al Sharpton, Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi popped in
and out of "Mr. Deeds" in sequences meant to elicit knowing chuckles
from the audience.</LD>
<TE>   Using cameos by well-known personalities in a joking way is
nothing new. But in current features, they assume a particularly
self-referential quality and depend heavily on an audience steeped in
movie culture and more than a little familiar with the inner workings
of show business. In a sense, cameos these days are used to establish
a conspiratorial relationship with the audience--to give them the
satisfaction of partaking in an insider's joke.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of cameos is part of our pitch to the audience," says Jay
Roach, who directed all three Austin Powers movies. The fact that
A-list Hollywood celebs appear in "Goldmember" is a jibe directed at
Hollywood itself, the filmmaker explains. "We are aware of the fact
that we are a cameo-oriented series, and we wanted to be cheeky--wink
at the audience and say, 'Look at us, we are gonna pretend like our
strange, goofy series has penetrated the Hollywood culture.'</TE>
<TE>   "So we had to get some of the most Hollywood of the Hollywood
people. In each case, the person was carefully cast for the part,"
says Roach, adding that the sequence was intended not only to meet,
but to trump the expectations of a public accustomed to over-the-top
Hollywood productions.</TE>
<TE>   Spoiler alert: If you don't want to know who's among the cameos,
stop here.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise guests include Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito, who all appear in a sequence
that explores the possibilities of Austin Powers going Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of these walk-on performances by well-known actors also
relies on the audience's familiarity with their career trajectory.
When Peter Graves appears briefly in the sci-fi parody "Men in Black
II" as host of a show called "Mysteries in History" and explains
pivotal plot points, the cameo draws bigger chuckles from viewers who
happen to know the actor once was host of the "Biography" series on
the A&amp;E cable network. He also appeared in several low-budget sci-fi
flicks in the 1950s, such as "It Conquered the World" and "Beginning
of the End"--the latter "a fabulous tale of grasshoppers taking over
Chicago," as Graves describes it, pointing out the analogy to "Men in
Black II," in which Earth is infiltrated by insect-like aliens.</TE>
<TE>   Graves says the function of his cameo was "really ticking two
parts of my career. And I thought it was flattering."</TE>
<TE>   The recent avalanche of cameos offers renewed testimony to the
extent to which mainstream comedies draw from recycled premises and
familiar archetypes.</TE>
<TE>   "So many modern films are referential to old films, remakes of
classic TV series and movies, or parodies of those," says UCLA film
professor Jonathan Kuntz. "Many of them have incorporated cameos that
refer back to the earlier incarnations--I already heard that [the
upcoming feature ] 'Incredible Hulk' will feature a cameo of Lou
Ferrigno, the actor who played Hulk in the original '70s TV show."</TE>
<TE>   The Austin Powers franchise is built on a cornucopia of references
to British espionage flicks from the 1960s, like "The Ipcress File,"
and it is no coincidence that Michael Caine, the spy in those movies,
makes a comeback in "Goldmember" as Austin Powers' father.</TE>
<TE>   And of course the series pokes fun at the James Bond movies,
although MGM, the studio that distributes the James Bond films,
initially blocked New Line Cinema from using the title because of its
reference to "Goldfinger," but the dispute was resolved amicably.</TE>
<TE>   The series has enjoyed success, explains Roach, because "we
embrace as much as we send up."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the "Goldmember" cameos fit in a larger effort to connect
with the audience by tapping into a shared pop-culture idiom.
Celebrity sushi chef Nobu Matsuhisa makes a brief appearance as Mr.
Roboto, a devious Japanese entrepreneur on the payroll of the evil
power-monger of the "Austin Powers" series, Dr. Evil. Matsuhisa's
presence prompts Austin Powers to utter the line, "Domo arrigato, Mr.
Roboto," which also happens to be a well-known lyric from the early
'80s pop tune "Mr. Roboto." Not only does teen idol Britney Spears
contribute a number to the "Goldmember" soundtrack; she also appears
long enough to confront Austin Powers in a dance-off. TV personality
Katie Couric dashes through, disguised as a prison guard, and John
Travolta pops up an another sequence.</TE>
<TE>   But being in lock-step with the zeitgeist can backfire. Given the
recent troubles that have befallen Martha Stewart and Michael
Jackson, their cameos in "Men in Black II," intended to gently
lampoon their public images, have been "likely to produce louder and
nastier laughter than they or the filmmakers intended," a New York
Times review of the movie noted.</TE>
<TE>   The origins of self-reflective cameos can be traced to early films
that dealt with the film business itself, UCLA's Kuntz says, like the
1928 "Show People" directed by King Vidor, in which Marion Davies
plays a country bumpkin trying to break into the movies. Hollywood
producers and stars played themselves in the film, which, says Kuntz,
made sense.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with the 1950s, well-known actors began showing up in
cameo performances not as themselves, but as characters. "Around the
World in Eighty Days" (1956) was built around a massive number of
cameos, with actors playing one-scene character parts, and became a
blockbuster for it.</TE>
<TE>   Cameos became an even more entrenched practice in the 1960s
"Batman" TV series, with a celebrity playing a villain every week.
Even people such as Frank Sinatra made one-shot appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Although such use of celebrities may have been designed primarily
to tickle the audience, Roach insists that the cameos in "Goldmember"
are not gratuitous. "It's kind of a variety show in a James Bond
setting. They all do something really funny; they don't just stand
there and wave," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Paltrow, Cruise, Spielberg and the other A-listers make
seconds-long appearances that incorporate and send up their
established Hollywood personas.</TE>
<TE>   Roach declined to discuss the specifics of the cameos, which have
been shrouded in what he calls "a very benign conspiracy," hatched by
the producers and distributor to preserve a sense of surprise for the
moviegoing public. (star Mike Myers, Paltrow, Cruise, Spielberg and
Spacey declined to be interviewed for this article through their
publicists, and DeVito responded through his representative that he
had promised not to talk about it.)</TE>
<TE>   At advance screenings, fliers were distributed urging viewers, in
Dr. Evil-speak, to "zip it," or keep mum about the cameos. Some
details have emerged, though, revealing that the creme of Hollywood
simply wanted to be part of the Austin Powers cultural maelstrom.
"Some of them mentioned to us after seeing [the second installment in
the franchise, "The Spy Who Shagged Me"] that they liked the series
and just wanted to be part of it somehow," Roach said. "They asked,
'Could I be a villainess?' " In several other instances,
co-screenwriters Myers and Michael McCullers wrote the cameo part
first and then cast it, encountering unanimous enthusiasm from
hyper-busy performers. "The first person we asked in each case is the
person who did it," Roach says.</TE>
<TE>   The stars, who usually command tens of millions per film, got "a
very negligible amount," "Goldmember" producer John Lyons says. "I
think all of them donated the money to charity."</TE>
<TE>   Although both Roach and Lyons insist that the Hollywood
personalities agreed to do cameos mostly for the fun of it, and
without expecting compensation commensurate with their customary
salaries, "for people who perform the cameos, this is another kind of
exposure," Graves says.</TE>
<TE>   "If their careers are not exactly red-hot at the moment, maybe
they can benefit from the exposure. Everywhere I go, people say, 'I
saw you in "Men in Black II,' " the actor says.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, I open the picture, and in the end credits I'm listed
as myself. That's not your average cameo, it's a hot cameo."</TE>

<HD>A Wistful Glimpse of Westernizing China</HD>
<DH>'Happy Times' continues director Zhang Yimou's run of
intimate films about ordinary people and their problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It sounds like a simple title, but "Happy Times" is open to multiple
interpretations. It can be applied seriously or ironically to what
transpires in Chinese director Zhang Yimou's fine new film, or simply
be taken at face value as the name of one of the plot's key
locations.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, "Happy Times" itself can be viewed from several vantage
points. The film makes use of unashamedly sentimental plot devices,
but its emotions are realistic and true to life. Although somewhat
old-fashioned, there is nothing cheap or easy about it, and it
provides a sharp picture of how life is lived in today's rapidly
Westernizing China. Simultaneously poignant, engagingly funny and
bittersweet, it mixes its elements in a way that is completely its
own.</LD>
<LD>   "Happy Times" also provides the latest example of a remarkable
change of pace for director Zhang, one of China's top filmmakers. A
former cinematographer, he came to the attention of the West with a
series of impressively shot tales of passion, including "Raise the
Red Lantern," "Red Sorghum" and "Shanghai Triad," all starring
actress Gong Li.</LD>
<TE>   Zhang's last several films, by contrast, have forsworn steamy
plots and dazzling cinematography. Simply photographed, with some
shots apparently caught on the fly in real locations, these new
films--including "Not One Less," "The Road Home" and now "Happy
Times"--are intimate and human-scaled, concentrating on ordinary
people and their problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Times," written by Gui Zi and based on a novella by Mo Yan,
is not in any hurry to get to the meat of its story, which focuses on
a middle-aged ne'er-do-well named Zhao (popular actor Zhao Benshan)
trying to get by in a large city so overrun by fast-food joints that
Haagen-Dazs is considered the treat of choice.</TE>
<TE>   Actually Zhao is not just trying to get by, he's trying to get
married. We see him sweet-talking a likely candidate, proclaiming "no
skinny women for me" to a plus-sized divorcee (Dong Lihua), although
we later learn that it's skinny women who've rejected him, not the
other way around.</TE>
<TE>   The divorcee wants a 50,000-yuan wedding, and the impecunious Zhao
asks co-worker Fu (Fu Biao) for help. Fu comes up with the idea of
refurbishing a derelict bus behind their factory and turning it into
a kind of love motel called the Happy Times Hut.</TE>
<TE>   A big talker for whom exaggeration is as natural as breathing,
Zhao promptly tells his intended that he is the owner of a major
hotel. This conniving woman, the mother of a boxcar-sized son, also
has a blind stepdaughter, Wu Ying (Dong Jie), from a previous
marriage whom she'd like off the premises. Surely there's a job for
this person, she insists, in Zhao 's enormous establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to confess the truth and hoping that the blindness of
Little Wu (as he comes to call her) will work in his favor when it
comes to hiding reality, Zhao agrees to find some kind of work for
this rail-thin 18-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of "Happy Times" is the quasi-paternal relationship that
develops between these two highly unlikely companions. A natural
conniver and truth-bender, Zhao is astonished by Wu's straight-line
intensity and refusal to prevaricate. Used to abuse and hostility,
she's initially sullen and defensive, a proud defender of the absent
father who's promised to return.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, things don't go smoothly for Zhao at the Happy Times
Hut, or anywhere else for that matter. Zhang's film is at its best
showing its protagonist desperately trying to cope with a shifting
and increasingly untenable reality while trying to keep the truth
from Little Wu, whom he's become increasingly fond of and who is more
aware than he realizes. Zhao's antics create a lot of humor, but a
kind of wistful sadness is never far from the surface.</TE>
<TE>   With a blind-girl-facing-the-world plot that might have served for
a silent picture premise, "Happy Times" is unafraid of emotion, but
that doesn't mean there is anything preordained about it.</TE>
<TE>   This is a film that goes its own way to the end as it asks the
audience, "What you just saw, were they happy times or not?" The
question is a good one, and the answer, like this film, is sure to
stay with you.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Considers Adding Adult Channels</HD>
<DH>Television: The beleaguered cable company is looking for
new sources of income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications' much-publicized financial
problems--culminating in the arrest of three members of its founding
family Wednesday--have more pragmatic implications for the cable
operator's estimated 1.2 million subscribers in Southern California.
They could see adult entertainment become available on their channel
lineup and already find themselves being courted by a satellite TV
service hoping to cash in on the company's woes.</LD>
<LD>   Among the changes being contemplated by Adelphia--the largest
cable TV provider in Southern California--is the introduction of
adult channels such as Playboy's Spice and the Hot Zone, which
company founder John Rigas had refused to carry on moral grounds.
Although standards vary by communities, Adelphia was alone among the
top eight cable system operators in setting forth such a blanket
policy.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, suppliers of adult entertainment have been quick
to point out the irony of that stance, given that Rigas and two of
his sons were not only arrested on securities, wire and bank fraud,
but were also sued by their former company Wednesday, in a lawsuit
claiming that they are "responsible for one of the largest cases of
corporate looting and self-dealing in American corporate history."</LD>
<TE>   In regard to introducing adult channels, Adelphia spokesman Eric
Andrus confirmed that the Coudersport, Pa.-based company, which filed
for bankruptcy protection in June, is "looking at a range of
additional revenue-generation steps that it can take, and at this
point nothing has been ruled in and nothing has been ruled out."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, representatives for Playboy Entertainment Group and New
Frontier Media, an adult entertainment firm in Boulder, Colo., said
they have already engaged in talks with Adelphia's new management.
Playboy, which acquired Vivid TV, Hot Network and Hot Zone last year,
operates seven networks that offer varying degrees of explicit
material.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy and other adult entertainment companies say they are
excited about the possibility of having access to Adelphia's nearly 6
million subscribers across the United States. In the Los Angeles
area--the nation's second largest television market, reaching 5.3
million households--Adelphia provides cable to more than one-third of
cable homes and more than 20% of all households.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy Entertainment Group spokesman Scott Barton said there is
"a huge market out there" for adult entertainment denied access by
Adelphia, and added that because so much production of adult films
occurs in the Los Angeles area, "it's almost like being in Nebraska
and not having anyone sell beef."</TE>
<TE>   Groups that applauded the previous position, however, are urging
Adelphia not to alter its strategy in pursuit of a quick financial
fix. "I would encourage the new management not to carry pornography,"
said Jan LaRue, chief counsel for the Washington-based lobbying group
Concerned Women for America, which seeks to promote biblical values.
LaRue added that many consumers "don't want to be subjected to it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ken Boenish, president of New Frontier's the Erotic
Networks, noted that with digital safeguards, Adelphia can meet the
demand from viewers who want the option of adult entertainment while
preventing those who don't from being exposed to it in any way.</TE>
<TE>   "Their decision never came from customer outcry or community
standards," he said of Adelphia. "Clearly, Los Angeles is not a
conservative community."</TE>
<TE>   Boenish added that adult films--a market that exceeds $800 million
annually via cable and satellite TV--provide much higher profit
margins than other pay-per-view movie titles and that the anticipated
shift by Adelphia systems, even if they are eventually sold to
another operator, will be "a significant boon to us."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's perceived vulnerability, meanwhile--including the many
customer complaints registered when the company began making the
transition to digital cable--has also inspired DirecTV to target
Adelphia in a radio and print ad campaign initiated this month.</TE>
<TE>   "Satisfied With Adelphia Cable? We didn't think so," read one ad
in The Times, offering discounted installation as well as $39.99
monthly service to Adelphia subscribers in Los Angeles, Ventura,
Riverside and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Although the advertising mentions Adelphia by name, DirecTV has
not limited the offer to its subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman said it was too soon to tell what response the
campaign has generated, but Adelphia has countered with its own print
ads, reassuring subscribers that the company intends to proceed with
service upgrades and "will continue to be available to you
uninterrupted."</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV declined to provide distribution figures, but data from
Nielsen Media Research indicates that 13% of households in the area
(or fewer than 700,000 homes) receive programming from "alternate
delivery systems," a category that encompasses satellite dishes, with
DirecTV accounting for the lion's share of that total.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, the competition is circling," Adelphia's Andrus noted.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia bought its way into Southern California in 1999 by
acquiring Century Communications, and began dropping adult networks
on those systems the following year. Its service currently reaches
more than twice as many homes as AT&amp;T, the next largest cable
provider in the Los Angeles market, which has a little more than
500,000 subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the barrage of headlines about Adelphia's former
management, cable industry representatives say that as long as the
company fulfills its obligations and viewers receive the programs
they want, consumers will have little incentive to make a switch. As
one cable executive put it, "In the end, we know that consumers don't
sit at work and say, 'Gee, I can't wait to go home and watch
Adelphia.' "</TE>

<HD>Garcia Lorca Reimagined</HD>
<DH>'The House of Bernarda Alba' gets a lighter touch at the
Taper</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the classic plays that are inappropriate for Mother's Day, "The
House of Bernarda Alba" is almost up there with "Medea." The
tyrannical titular character of Federico Garcia Lorca's drama doesn't
murder her children, but she tries hard to prevent them from fully
experiencing the variety of life. After her husband dies, she decrees
that her five adult female offspring will do nothing but mourn for
eight years--prisoners in their own home, with marriage as the only
possible escape route.</LD>
<LD>   In a small village in 1936 Spain, she would probably argue, what
choice did she have? If women aren't madonnas on their wedding day,
they'll be considered whores.</LD>
<LD>   The recent attention focused on misogyny, Taliban-style, is a
reminder that this kind of cultural conditioning is hardly extinct.
Still, it seems so remote from contemporary urban society that a
theatergoer entering the Mark Taper Forum to see Chita Rivera as
Bernarda Alba may wonder whether this play can be anything beyond a
grim documentary about another time, another place.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia Lorca's notation that the play was "intended as a
photographic document"--which appears prominently at the beginning of
the English translations--seems to reinforce that point of view.</TE>
<TE>   But Chay Yew, author of the adaptation at the Taper, and director
Lisa Peterson generally ignore that admonition. And the play comes
alive.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in the program, Yew acknowledged Garcia Lorca's
intent but said, "I was interested in bringing back some of the
lyricism that permeates most of Lorca's plays and poetry." Yew's text
is not only more lyrical but more explicit than the authorized
English translation by Richard L. O'Connell and James Graham-Lujan.
The daughters' personalities are individuated more fully, with one
even becoming a budding, book-taught--albeit ineffective--feminist.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's staging uses Rachel Hauck's set, Mark Bennett's score,
ritualized movement and a touch of dance in ways that allow the
audience to sense the feelings that are being repressed, as well as
the repression itself. Likewise, we see the stifling torpor in the
household without literally experiencing it inside the theater.</TE>
<TE>   In another review a few years ago, I wrote that "Alba" makes "King
Lear" look lighthearted. I take it back. There are rich, bawdy laughs
to be found in "Alba," and this company has found them.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while it's predictable enough that the always commanding
Rivera has the overweening imperiousness of Bernarda well in hand,
it's more surprising to see her chuckling as she relishes a tidbit of
gossip from her longtime housekeeper, Poncia.</TE>
<TE>   Yew's text also enables Rivera to express a human pang of
sentiment, missing from the authorized translation, about the fate of
her youngest and most rebellious daughter (Sandra Oh). This Bernarda
is not a witch.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the play's comedy and its warmer tones emerge from the
eye-opening performance of Camille Saviola as Poncia. She pokes her
squat frame into every corner of the household, regaling the
daughters with tales from her own marriage, offering words of wisdom
to her employers despite their class-based prejudices against her,
occasionally exploding with curt Anglo-Saxon imprecations.</TE>
<TE>   Shaheen Vaaz plays the younger, quieter maid with almost equal
authority. Yew's text, in contrast to the original, provides more
specific allusions to her affair with Bernarda's late husband.</TE>
<TE>   The casting of Bernarda's old mother and daughters is one of the
production's most decisive breaks with photo-realism: Four of these
women have Asian features, and the sisters' ages are not as obvious
as Garcia Lorca appeared to desire. This may alienate those who can't
manage an additional suspension of disbelief, but it will expand the
meaning of the play for others beyond the confines of 1936 Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Oh--the house's free spirit--and Rita Wolf as her most envious and
eagle-eyed sister handle the play's most torrid exchanges well,
including a moment in which the former sucks the latter's finger in a
brief physicalization of their repressed sexuality. Giving Lydia Look
thick-framed glasses for her role as the proto-feminist is too
obvious, but Look's girlish voice adds a note of irony to her talk.</TE>
<TE>   Marissa Chibas plays the eldest, betrothed sister with hapless
befuddlement, accented by an amusing polka-dotted mourning outfit
from costumer Joyce Kim Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Galindo capably portrays the most cynical sister. Tsai Chin
stalks the house as Bernarda's mad mom, her white tangle of hair a
reminder of the general decay.</TE>
<TE>   The color palette is primarily white and black, with red accents
and rosy margins, exemplified in beds of petals that fit the symbolic
framework but are unfortunately reminiscent of "American Beauty." A
row of small trees hovers overhead.</TE>
<TE>   A strolling Annas Allaf stirs up the surfaces not only with his
oud and guitar, but also as the only tangible evidence that the
mysterious other sex actually exists.</TE>

<HD>No, Baby: Humor Stays Undercover in 'Goldmember'</HD>
<DH>Stunt casting aside, Mike Myers' third go at 'Austin
Powers' wilts under gross-out gags.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone likes the idea of Austin Powers, but the actuality of
"Austin Powers in Goldmember" is a lot harder to take.</LD>
<LD>   The swinging 1970s London spy with the "yeah, baby, yeah" attitude
is a clever conceit, and the gifted Mike Myers' passion to play him,
his arch nemesis, Dr. Evil, plus assorted other bad guys has made
this James Bond-Harry Palmer parody so popular that some of
Hollywood's biggest stars agreed to appear in "Goldmember."</LD>
<LD>   These major players can be seen in the film's opening sequence,
taking the parts of Austin, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and others in the
putative big-studio version of an Austin movie--creating what is, in
effect, a spoof of a spoof.</LD>
<TE>   New Line Cinema has asked the media not to ruin the joke by
revealing the names of these heavyweights, even going so far as
handing out a picture of Dr. Evil emblazoned with the slogan "Zip
It!" at the film's main press screening. That wish will be respected
here because it'd be a shame to ruin what turns out to be the only
consistently funny part of this third Austin extravaganza. Long after
the glamorous heavyweights have packed up and gone on to their A-list
careers, the audience is left to slog through a wearying hit-and-miss
affair that gradually disintegrates under the weight of what might be
a world-record number of scatological references and bodily function
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Goldmember" is directed by Jay Roach, who did the honors
on the first two, its guiding light is clearly Myers, who co-wrote
(with Michael McCullers), co-produced and played four roles.</TE>
<TE>   Myers' idea of a movie turns out to be similar to Ed Sullivan's
idea for a variety show: Toss in a little bit of everything and hope
for the best. There are songs, there are dances, there is action,
there are well-known co-stars (Michael Caine, Fred Savage of TV's
"The Wonder Years") and there are, of course, a lot of girls.</TE>
<TE>   There are also attempts at humor, some of which are actually
funny. Myers throws himself into his numerous parts with considerable
gusto and occasional success. A scene of Dr. Evil and alter-ego
Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) joining a bunch of cons in a riff on rapper
Jay-Z's version of "It's a Hard Knock Life" from "Annie" is as
boggling as it sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Even some of the stunt casting is amusing if you're in on the
joke. The part of Mr. Roboto, an evil Japanese businessman, is played
by top L.A. restaurateur Nobu Matsuhisa. "We cast Nobu," Myers says
in the press notes, at least half-seriously, "because if it was 8
o'clock on Saturday night and we wanted to go to Matsuhisa, which is
always packed, we'd still be able to get a table. We're not idiots.
It's the best food on the planet."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that won't make you laugh, unless you've got a
12-year-old's sense of humor, is the film's tireless parade of
gross-out gags and scatological verbal jests. Myers gets a charge out
of this material--it wouldn't be here if he didn't--but so much of it
is so tedious it's difficult to believe an adult actually sat down
and wrote it.</TE>
<TE>   "Goldmember's" plot, such as it is, involves the criminal
machinations of Johann van der Smut (Myers, again), a criminal
mastermind who "lost his genitalia in an unfortunate smelting
accident" and has had it replaced by the precious metal. Joining
forces with Dr. Evil, he plans--no surprise here--to destroy the
world unless you know who can stop him.</TE>
<TE>   You know who, however, has problems of his own, especially the
degree to which his celebrated secret-agent father, Nigel Powers
(Caine), has no respect for him. Dr. Evil is having family
difficulties as well, as a sibling rivalry breaks out again between
Mini-Me and the evil one's natural son, Scott (Seth Green).</TE>
<TE>   Fitting in here somewhere is Beyonce Knowles of Destiny's Child,
making her big-screen debut as the Pam Grier-influenced FBI agent
Foxxy Cleopatra. Knowles has a pleasant screen presence, but has
difficulty overcoming the film's conception of her as an afterthought
in a gold bikini.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most surprising information in the "Goldmember" press
material is Myers' contention that "broad comedy is as legitimate and
valid a delivery system for expansive, spiritual ideas as any other
art form." Maybe and maybe not, but anyone finding anything spiritual
in "Goldmember" is invited to join Myers for dinner at Matsuhisa.
It's likely to be a very small group.</TE>

<HD>A Word From the Sponsor: Read the Radio</HD>
<DH>Technology widely used in Europe is offered on five local
Clear Channel stations. If it catches on, expect written ads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music fans driven crazy by disc jockeys who never identify the songs
or artists they're playing can rejoice: Now the radio itself will
name that tune.</LD>
<LD>   For listeners who already think there are too many advertisements
on the radio, this is not good news; the ads are starting to appear
on the radio in the form of text messages scrolling across the
display screen.</LD>
<LD>   Radio Data Service is a technology that has been around about a
decade, enabling FM receivers to automatically display the call
letters of a station or identify the song and artist being played.
Advanced systems can shut off a CD or cassette if a traffic report or
weather warning comes on the air, if the user has programmed it to do
so.</LD>
<TE>   Widely popular in Europe, where the receivers can also switch
between stations of the same format to find the best reception, Radio
Data Service has mainly languished in the United States because
neither broadcasters nor the electronics industry ever embraced it.
Only about 700 of the 5,000 radio stations in the United States
employ it, according to the National Assn. of Broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   "To date it's never been a successful commercial medium. In some
respects this is a solution in search of a problem," said Steve
Herbert, chief engineer at KCRW-FM (89.9), which has used Radio Data
Service for about eight years to display call letters and program
information. "Anything that we could do to stand out was viewed as a
good thing."</TE>
<TE>   But now a Newport Beach company, dMarc Networks, has partnered
with radio giant Clear Channel Communications to start offering song
information, traffic reports, stock quotes, news headlines, sports
scores and, of course, advertisements, on the company's five
L.A.-area FM stations: KHHT (92.3), KYSR (98.7), KIIS (102.7), KOST
(103.5) and KBIG (104.3).</TE>
<TE>   On Radio Data Service-equipped receivers--found in some home
stereos and appearing recently in General Motors, Ford, Chrysler,
Toyota and others' car radios--the messages will flash in bursts up
to eight characters long, in the space where the time or station
frequency is usually displayed.</TE>
<TE>   The messages are beamed from radio stations on a "sub-carrier," a
signal on a separate frequency that piggybacks the broadcaster's
audio transmission. DMarc president Ryan Steelberg said he saw the
potential in this resource that all FM stations have. And though
Radio Data Service isn't ubiquitous, about 12% of all cars and 40% of
all new cars in Southern California have the technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers just made it seem like an interesting opportunity,"
said Roy Laughlin, Clear Channel's regional vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to pioneer it as a way to service the listeners
better. And once you get somebody to enjoy an additional service,
there should be a way to monetize it," Laughlin said, such as by
offering information on buying albums or concert tickets.</TE>
<TE>   KCRW, a public radio station based in Santa Monica, tried Radio
Data Service as a funding source when it started using the system,
scrolling "See your name here" messages, Herbert said. But KCRW got
more angry calls from listeners who didn't want commercials coming
from their noncommercial station than it got inquiries from potential
underwriters.</TE>
<TE>   "We abandoned that experiment pretty quickly," he said, and now
the station uses the system only to identify itself and show what
program is on.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, that whole technology has undergone the
chicken-and-egg phenomenon," Herbert said; stereo companies weren't
manufacturing the receivers because not enough stations were using
the technology, and stations didn't want to bother with the system
because so few radios could pick up the messages.</TE>
<TE>   But even though Radio Data Service-enabled radios aren't numerous,
Steelberg sees them as an untapped market. And the equipment that
stations need to transmit the messages "is pretty cheap right now,"
he said, a few thousand dollars compared to the $67,000 to $100,000
price tag expected for stations that want to convert to all-digital
transmission within the next couple of years. That technology, when
it arrives, will also feature text messages and, unlike the Radio
Data Service system, graphics, interactivity and better sound
quality.</TE>
<TE>   Steelberg said his company's offerings will be compatible with
digital radio, so it won't be obsolete in a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pushing the RDS right now because it's in the marketplace,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   With its system, dMarc sells the ads and splits the revenue with
the station. Steelberg said radio stations are "obviously excited,
because it adds to the bottom line. Our job is to make it not only
profitable but turnkey for them."</TE>
<TE>   Each station and its transmitter are connected to dMarc via the
Internet. A station sends its computerized playlist to dMarc, which
receives the information four to 10 milliseconds before a song
begins. If a Madonna song is playing, for example, dMarc's computer
searches its database for the current ad campaign related to
her--whether it's an announcement of an upcoming concert or a pitch
to buy her new album at Wal-Mart--then sends that message to the
station's transmitter so it can be broadcast along with the song.</TE>
<TE>   The ads can also be independent of whatever is airing on the
station: A message can be programmed to appear at a certain time of
day, or if the temperature hits 80 degrees, when your radio might
suggest you stop at a 7-Eleven and buy a Coke.</TE>
<TE>   Steelberg said dMarc has already tried a stock-ticker program
during morning drive time on KYSR. "Unfortunately, the market wasn't
doing what people wanted, so I don't think the consumers liked what
the content said," he noted.</TE>
<TE>   But a drop in the Dow may not be the only crash a driver has to
worry about while rolling at 60 mph trying to read stock quotes, the
Dodgers score, the date of an upcoming Paul McCartney concert and the
greeting, "You ... are ... tuned ... to ... KBIG.... Please ... drive
... safely."</TE>
<TE>   A study by the Center for Transportation Research at Virginia Tech
University showed that in-car devices requiring more than 15 seconds
of attention or more than four glances greatly increase the risk a
driver will veer from his lane or deviate at least 10 mph from his
intended speed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an in-dash billboard. We don't feel it's any more
distracting than the bells and whistles that are in your car now,"
said Steelberg, who, with his brother Chad, founded the online
advertising company AdForce.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of safety, the main problem children out there are the
interactive devices," such as cellular phones and navigation systems,
he said. "Our product is no more distracting than your oil gauge
light going on. It's not like we're pumping motion video into the
system."</TE>
<TE>   DMarc hopes to expand the service elsewhere in the country by the
fall, with Steelberg saying the company can--by using the
Internet--work with stations in New York and Dallas as easily as with
those in Los Angeles and even coordinate ads in several cities. He
said the company also hopes to work with other chains and with
independent broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nifty technology," Herbert said. "Hopefully it will catch
on. It would be nice to have a reason to have it."</TE>

<HD>'Who Is Cletis Tout' Offers Clever Answers</HD>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The answer to "Who Is Cletis Tout?" lies in a gem of a romantic crime
comedy that turns out to be clever, amusing and unpredictable.</LD>
<LD>   Writer-director Chris Ver Wiel, in only his second feature, has
some fresh ideas and knows just what to do with an ensemble cast
headed by Christian Slater, with Tim Allen, Richard Dreyfuss, RuPaul,
Billy Connolly and "Ally McBeal's" Portia de Rossi. The film has an
inviting mellow look, having been shot in an unnamed Toronto amid
fine old buildings for a deliberately retro feeling.</LD>
<LD>   Escaped con Trevor Finch (Slater) has just checked into a
comfortable old hotel when he finds Allen's Critical Jim pointing a
gun at him. Jim is a hit man hired to eliminate one Cletis Tout,
whose identity Finch has assumed. Jim is not your everyday
coldblooded killer-for-hire. They don't call him Critical for
nothing, as he is an impassioned, discriminating movie buff who loves
the good stories the great old movies told. Because good stories have
grown scarce on the screen, Jim is keen to hear Finch's. Quick on his
feet, Finch says: "It's got it all. A jewel heist, a prison break, a
girl."</LD>
<TE>   Finch is not exaggerating: His tale is tall, funny and
confounding, and shouldn't be given away here; let's just say the
plot is deliciously convoluted. All that's necessary to know is that
Finch and Dreyfuss' Micah have become pals in prison, and the idea is
that once they break out, Micah will retrieve loot he concealed
before being caught.</TE>
<TE>   All of Ver Wiel's developments are clever: how Micah pulled off
the caper in the first place and how Finch intends to retrieve the
goods once complications inevitably escalate are funny, inspired
sequences.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, mutual attraction blossoms between Finch and
Micah's daughter Tess--and Critical Jim becomes more concerned that
life imitates art. At every turn, Ver Wiel, who has been a stand-up
comic and an actor, knows what he's doing. When Finch begins to spin
his story, reaching back in time, Critical Jim exclaims, "Ah, the
flashback! Much maligned, often misunderstood!"--and goes on to cite
Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" as the perfect example of its use.</TE>
<TE>   Ver Wiel himself is no slouch at the flashback. When he's building
action, furthering plot and cutting back to Critical Jim and Finch in
that hotel room, their dialogue is always witty. At the right moment,
the story takes off with no looking back.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine anyone in the cast not having a good time;
the high spirits are contagious yet the portrayals are free of winks
and nudges. Connolly is hilarious as a free-spirited, corrupt coroner
and RuPaul is reliably outrageous as the real Tout's nosey,
insinuating neighbor. Randy Edelman's score is rightly romantic, and
director of photography Jerzy Zielinski's camerawork casts a warm
glow over everything. "Who Is Cletis Tout?" is crisply contemporary
in its sensibility while offering a deft tip of the hat to beloved
genres--the heist, the prison breakout thriller, the gangster picture
and screwball comedy.</TE>
<TE>   After "Who Is Cletis Tout?," no one should have to ask, "Who is
Chris Ver Wiel?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language, some violence and sexuality. Times
guidelines: Some of the jokes are too adult for youngsters and some
of the brief violence too intense.</TE>

<HD>A Neglected Stretch of Land Becomes Community's Pride</HD>
<DH>Parks: In Washington, a group transforms derelict Watts
Branch creek land into a kids' haven.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN A. CROCKETT Jr.</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Parks can be majestic places with serene settings and gentle breezes
that touch the soul. Marvin Gaye's music is like that too. Put on any
of the soulful crooner's early love songs, and they can take the
place of a glass of wine or a setting sun.</LD>
<LD>   Six blocks from where Gaye grew up in northeast Washington is a
patch of grass and woods along Watts Branch, a 3.7-mile creek that
runs into the Anacostia River. It's perfect for a park, except for
years it's been a shady spot for winos and drug addicts. Local kids
didn't play there. The community nicknamed it "Needle Park" because
it was littered with used syringes.</LD>
<LD>   Today there's a handmade sign nailed to a light pole calling the
patch "Marvin Gaye Amphitheatre." It's a small sign, but it signals
great hope.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Coleman, director of Washington Parks &amp; People, wants to
turn the entire Watts Branch creekside into a tribute to Marvin Gaye,
starting with Needle Park.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman's nonprofit group goes into neighborhoods and rehabs
parks. Its mission is "to reconnect people with the land and use the
land to reconnect people with each other." In northeast Washington,
"we started talking to people and we kept hearing these great stories
about Marvin Gaye and thought, why not call the park Marvin Gaye
Park?"</TE>
<TE>   Last year on Marvin Gaye's birthday--April 2--Parks &amp; People began
cleaning up a 1.6-mile section of Watts Branch. During the next 14
months, more than 4,000 volunteers contributed to the effort. More
than 7,000 bags of garbage were collected. Twenty-six abandoned cars
were hauled away--including one that contained a body. About 2,000
hypodermic needles were picked up. Finally, in June, the park was
ready.</TE>
<TE>   On several recent Saturdays, Coleman and his team set up shop
there. Thanks to the D.C. Department of Recreation and Parks, which
donated a mobile stage, they've been holding summer concerts and
showing movies.</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday, a carnival was sponsored by a church group, then a
concert featured the East of the River steel band and a Native
American flute player. From 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays through the
summer, children growing crops at the nearby Robert Lederer Youth
Gardens, a half-acre farm that neighborhood kids run, come to sell
their produce.</TE>
<TE>   Needle Park has been clean for more than a month, and the kids are
returning.</TE>
<TE>   Before Marvin Gaye became the Marvin Gaye who would pen songs
about revolution, social protest and, of course, sexual healing, he
was a lanky kid in Washington who loved basketball. When he was 14,
he and his family moved to East Capitol Dwellings, a housing complex
in easternmost Washington. That would be his home until the '60s,
when he'd leave for the bright lights and "shoo-wop sound" in
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   In East Capitol Dwellings, he met two people who became lifelong
friends, Reese Palmer and Peasie Adams. They loved to sing too.
Palmer, Gaye and a few other neighborhood cats would stand on corners
and sing doo-wop.</TE>
<TE>   "Marvin's house was the last stop on the bus line," remembers
Palmer, 64, who sings with the Orioles, a doo-wop group. "After
school, we would get off the bus and just sing, didn't matter where."</TE>
<TE>   Often, kids would meet at Adams' house to sing. Marvin's father, a
Pentecostal minister who ruled his house with an iron hand and a
fire-laced tongue, never approved. Marvin and his father would often
clash.</TE>
<TE>   "His father would trip, man," Palmer says. "His dad used to tell
my father that people that sang on corners were bums. He used to
refer to me as the 'head bum' and tell me that I was leading Marvin
down the wrong path."</TE>
<TE>   That path took Marvin to superstardom. Along the way, he developed
a cocaine habit. Convinced that someone was trying to harm his
family, he demanded that his father keep a gun--and sent one via his
bodyguard. One day when Marvin came to visit, a fight broke out
between him and his dad. Marvin's father grabbed the gun from under
the pillow where he kept it and shot Marvin dead.</TE>
<TE>   On a sunny July afternoon in the park, there are no more needles,
only children and folks from People &amp; Parks setting up a youth talent
show.</TE>
<TE>   None of the kids has a prepared routine. About 20 children, 15 and
younger, stand on the stage. A dozen slate-gray folding chairs sit in
the grass. Microphones rest in their cradles. Two speakers stand on
metallic legs. This is the Marvin Gaye Amphitheatre.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Lil' Bow Wow's voice comes through the speakers, all 20
kids become Lil' Bow Wow. When someone pops in the go-go band
Backyard, 20 little bodies become Jell-O, giggling and jiggling
across the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Off to the right of the stage is a small bridge that separates
Clay Terrace, a tough housing complex, from the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Just look at this," says Clay Terrace resident Reg Ward, 24
stretching his arms toward the kids. "This is why I come down here.
What's that saying? In Africa, one child is raised by the village.
That's how it is down here. People come through here now and throw
trash in the trash cans. I know that don't sound like much, but Rome
wasn't built in a day."</TE>

<HD>Networks Planning Sept. 11 Observations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NBC plans a prime-time concert to mark the first anniversary of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, while its two chief rivals are sticking
with news coverage that night.</LD>
<LD>   First Lady Laura Bush will be on NBC's "Concert for America" at
the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. She said she hopes it "will
allow us to use the arts to soothe our emotions."</LD>
<LD>   For the past few months, television network executives have been
wrestling with what tone to set for their Sept. 11 coverage and how
extensive it should be, trying to anticipate the public's desire to
reflect.</LD>
<TE>   "My own strong impression is there has been a drifting away
emotionally and intellectually" from the events of Sept. 11, NBC
News' Tom Brokaw said.</TE>
<TE>   NBC hopes, with its news coverage, to remind people of what the
country went through and tell what's been learned since then, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, CBS and NBC all will air expanded editions of their morning
news shows that day to cover planned commemorations. Many of those
are timed to coincide with what happened exactly a year ago; the
first plane hit the World Trade Center at 8:48 a.m. Eastern Daylight
Time.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the network plans diverge. ABC News will stay in
continuous coverage through prime time, with breaks for local news.
NBC will also show news that afternoon, including a town
meeting-format interview featuring Brokaw and rescue workers,
survivors and family members.</TE>
<TE>   CBS hasn't set its afternoon plans, in part because it's still
trying to gauge the level of interest among the public and its
affiliates. The network will turn its prime-time schedule over to its
newsmagazines, "60 Minutes" and "60 Minutes II," for Sept. 11-related
programming, CBS News spokeswoman Sandra Genelius said.</TE>
<TE>   CBS will also rerun its two-hour "9-11" documentary featuring
footage from inside the World Trade Center on Sept. 8. Fox will air a
two-hour prime-time special, "The Day America Changed," on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's prime-time news coverage will feature a reconstruction of
events within the World Trade Center, the network said.</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw said NBC was approached by the Kennedy Center about a
concert, and the network thought the music would be "an important and
necessary ingredient" to the coverage.</TE>

<HD>Cole Continues a Career Transition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Natalie Cole's multifaceted career has been moving more and more
deeply into jazz territory over the past few years. Curiously, her
passage is a kind of inversion of the career of her father, Nat King
Cole, in the sense that he transited from the jazz world into the pop
arena. Although Natalie Cole has never completely abandoned the pop
and R&amp;B stylings of her earlier career, she has displayed
consistently greater ease with the elements of jazz in each of her
recent appearances.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday night's performance at the Hollywood Bowl was no
exception. Accompanied by a large ensemble consisting of a big jazz
band, a string section, French horns and three backup singers, Cole
entranced an audience of more than 12,000 with a program ranging from
songs associated with her father to a trio of tunes from her upcoming
Verve album, "Ask a Woman Who Knows."</LD>
<LD>   Her very first offering, "I Haven't Got Anything Better to Do"
(first recorded by Dinah Washington), is the opening track on the CD,
her first new album in three years. Well suited to Cole's elegant,
interpretive manner, it flowed with an undercurrent of rhythmic swing
that would characterize much of the evening's music.</LD>
<TE>   More familiar items--"Teach Me Tonight," "Let's Face the Music and
Dance," "Paper Moon," "Stardust" among them--ranged from hard-edged
vocal-with-big-band jazz to intimate balladry. And, predictably,
there was the now-obligatory rendering of "Unforgettable,"
synchronized to a duet with a big screen video projection of her
father.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive moments of the evening, however, were not the
more obvious ones. Although it may have appeared as though Cole's
jazz talents were best displayed in her vigorous, up-tempo scatting,
the contrary was the case. There was no denying the gritty sense of
swing present in her vocalized forays into her upper register. But
both the abrasiveness of her sound in these passages, as well as her
tendency to rely on repetitive riffing, diminished her believability
in this area.</TE>
<TE>   She was far more effective in numbers such as Michael Franks'
"Tell Me All About It" (also on the new album) and the Gus Kahn and
Walter Donaldson standard, "My Baby Just Cares for Me"--songs in
which she balanced her impressive, storytelling qualities with
poised, beautifully articulated phrasing.</TE>
<TE>   Other, different aspects of Cole's versatility surfaced with an
incendiary rendering of Leiber &amp; Stoller's "I'm a Woman" and crisply
rhythmic interpretations (with her backup singers) of Lambert,
Hendricks &amp; Ross versions of a pair of Count Basie pieces, "It's
Sand, Man" and "Two for the Blues." Impressive work from a performer
who is slowly maturing into an engaging, jazz-oriented artist.</TE>
<TE>   Pianist Joe Sample, whose trio opened the evening with a typically
vigorous, groove-driven set, also joined Cole on two of the songs
from her new album.</TE>

<HD>Universal Studios in Florida Is Earning Its Last Name Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Phyllis and Melvin Miles, visiting Universal Studios here from
Seabrook, Md., are squealing happily while they bounce several inches
off the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "Who knew we would be taking 'bouncing lessons' on our vacation in
Orlando?" said Phyllis Miles, a 47-year-old music teacher.</LD>
<LD>   "They really want you to show enthusiasm if you win, and my
bouncing needed some work," added her husband, Melvin, 46, a jazz
pianist.</LD>
<TE>   The Mileses were contestants at the taping of a revival of "Beat
the Clock," a game show that harks back to 1950s origins with host
Bud Collier. The program is being taped at Universal Studios in July
and August to air on the Pax TV channel for 13 weeks starting in
September.</TE>
<TE>   "Having this show has a big impact at Universal. It's putting more
than 70 people to work and it gives us an extra attraction for
guests, who can be part of the live audience or even audition as
contestants and win cash and other prizes," said Paul Meena, vice
president and general manager of studio production at the attraction.</TE>
<TE>   The show is corny in the tradition of its genre, with contests
that include stacking huge empty cardboard boxes. But it's a real
working-studio show, and that's a novelty lately to Orlando tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Although both Universal and Walt Disney World's Disney-MGM Studios
opened more than a decade ago billed as working centers for
filmmaking, the theme parks haven't been able to keep that promise.</TE>
<TE>   Competition from Canada--which offers sizable economic incentives
to such projects, and Miami, with more glamorous location sites--has
nipped a once-budding Orlando screen-entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Pax is delighted to find rental space in Orlando,
with Universal providing free audiences. "If you were doing this in
California, you'd have to pay people," said S. William Scott,
programming president.</TE>

counterculture movement.</DH>

<LD>"The Cockettes" confounds the cliche that if you remember the '60s,
you weren't really there. An irresistible documentary look at the
ensemble of the moment in the hippie kingdom of San Francisco, this
comprehensive and charming film not only recalls those days exactly,
it also manages the wonderful trick of taking us back there along
with it.</LD>
<LD>   Directors David Weissman and Bill Weber have used excellent
interviews and remarkable vintage footage (some of it compiled by
former Cockette Martin Worman for a doctoral dissertation) to
illuminate a corner of half-forgotten countercultural history.</LD>
<LD>   By doing so, they've also managed to capture the feeling of an era
now dealt with largely in terms of bromides about license and free
love. If you want to not only see what the '60s looked like but
experience what it was like to be in them, it's hard to improve on
what's here.</LD>
<TE>   The Cockettes were a performing troupe best defined (by director
and early fan John Waters) as a bunch of "hippie acid freak drag
queens." Men and women, some straight but mostly gay, they were
united by a passion for LSD, by a belief in "complete sexual anarchy,
always a good thing" (Waters again), and by something else, something
that can best be described as an unlikely, almost heroic naivete.</TE>
<TE>   As much as the drugs and the blurring of sexual lines, the
Cockettes were characterized by a belief that they were part of a
revolutionary movement that was going to change the world into
something better. It's hard not to be charmed by their messianic good
cheer, their enthusiastic guilelessness and sense of play. These were
people who built their own reality, who were, as someone vividly
says, "allowed to live at the end of their imagination."</TE>
<TE>   "Cockettes" begins with a moment--a November 1971 appearance at a
New York theater thick with celebrities--that seemed to mark a
collective high point for the group but, as we come to see, actually
finds them already on a downward slide.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days, the dozen or so former Cockettes interviewed
for the film just seemed to find each other in the spaced-out melting
pot of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury. What united them was a passion
for dressing up like you wouldn't believe; it was, someone says, as
if they communicated through drag.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of this pack was New York transplant George Harris, now
known as Hibiscus, accurately described as looking like "Jesus Christ
with lipstick."</TE>
<TE>   Still intensely charismatic in vintage videos, Hibiscus was the
group's acknowledged visionary inspiration, and it was his idea that
what the company (named for Radio City's Rockettes) needed was to be
on stage.</TE>
<TE>   As chance would have, North Beach's Palace Theater was running a
midnight film series called the Nocturnal Dream Shows.</TE>
<TE>   Agreeing to appear in exchange for free tickets, the Cockettes'
can-can dancing combination of anarchy, nudity, glitter, drugs and
lace became an instant success, and a San Francisco institution was
born.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers Weissman and Weber have done a heroic job of getting
the surviving Cockettes on film, from the guileless Sweet Pam and the
waspish Goldie Glitters to token male heterosexual Marshall and
self-described bad girl Fayette, whose life ambition was to be an
adventuress.</TE>
<TE>   The group put on a series of loosely constructed shows with names
like "Gone With the Showboat to Oklahoma" that, remembers Sweet Pam,
"were so untraditional, so far from the mainstream, they were almost
illegal." Film was also dabbled in, from "Elevator Girls in Bondage"
to the mock "Tricia's Wedding," which debuted at the Palace on the
same day as the actual event in the Nixon White House.</TE>
<TE>   As show followed show, the big question with the Cockettes became,
one member put it, "can mediocrity stand success?" Celebrity led to
ego problems, and a split developed between Hibiscus and his allies,
who believed in the purity of free performance, and those who
believed in professionalism and felt money should be changing hands.</TE>
<TE>   But the truth was that what the Cockettes did was always more the
public expression of a lifestyle than a stage event that could be
planned or transplanted, hence the group's celebrated flop in New
York. In addition to personality clashes, the ensemble was also done
in by early deaths, first from drug addiction and later from AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's possible to see in their idiosyncratic work a
prefiguring of everything from gay liberation to glam rock. As
journalist Lillian Roxon predicted back then, "Every time you see too
much glitter, or a rhinestone out of place, you [will] know it's
because of the Cockettes."</TE>

<HD>'Swimming' Gracefully Evokes Teen Moods</HD>
<DH>Lauren Ambrose, from HBO's 'Six Feet Under,' stars as a
teenager learning about herself and love.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Swimming" makes the coming-of-age experience seem as fresh as
tomorrow because its makers take this inevitably painful and often
perplexing transition seriously without being solemn, bringing to it
a sense of humor that is wry rather than jokey.</LD>
<LD>   Director Robert J. Siegel depicts its unfolding with a grace and
sunny sensuality, and he and his co-writers have created a group of
young people who are drawn with a deftness and an awareness of their
complexity that is more common to French rather than American movies.</LD>
<LD>   Yet "Swimming" is as American as apple pie. The setting is the
summer resort town of Myrtle Beach, S.C., where a brother and his
sister have taken over a busy boardwalk restaurant from their
parents, who have retired to Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   The film's central figure is the sister, Frankie (Lauren Ambrose,
an Emmy nominee for her role in HBO's "Six Feet Under"), who is about
15 or 16. It's hard to tell, for Frankie has not yet blossomed. She's
a pale, apple-cheeked redhead who wears no makeup, and her standard
uniform is baggy coveralls over a T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Older brother Neil (Josh Pais) is boss, and she lives with him,
his wife and their two small sons. Next door to the family restaurant
is a body-piercing parlor run by Frankie's longtime best friend,
Nicola (Jennifer Dundas Lowe), a brash, extroverted, tousle-haired
blond loyal to and protective of the inexperienced Frankie.</TE>
<TE>   At one point Frankie exclaims that she hates her environment, and
no wonder. She is a waitress at the family restaurant and surely must
feel like a wallflower amid the summertime crowd of stunning-looking
young men and women, who all fervently believe that if you've got it,
flaunt it. Into the lives of Frankie, her family and friends walks
the tall, gorgeous Josee (Joelle Carter), a classic beauty in the
Candice Bergen tradition, whose looks have given her a well-justified
self-confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Josee takes a waitress job alongside Frankie, who is bowled over
by this glamour girl, which instantly triggers jealousy within
Nicola. In the meantime, Frankie catches the eye of Heath (a very
likable Jamie Harrold), who has arrived in town in an old
hippie-esque van with his dog and a load of tie-dyed T-shirts to
sell.</TE>
<TE>   With the disturbingly attractive and uninhibited presence of Josee
stirring things up around her, Frankie finds herself increasingly
drawn to Heath, who is as sweet and affectionate as a puppy and whose
attraction to her is more than sexual but has no promises of love,
undying or otherwise. Frankie at last begins to see in herself the
desirable young woman she is in the process of becoming.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose's Frankie, who is more intelligent and capable of
reflection than those around her but is even more unworldly than she
realizes, is tremendously appealing. So is Nicola, for all her
headstrong, reckless ways, and Lowe reveals the emotional
vulnerability and capacity for caring for others that lurk beneath
Nicola's bold facade. Refreshingly, Carter's Josee is not some
unbalanced troublemaker or calculating villainess, but a spontaneous,
amoral creature.</TE>
<TE>   As actresses, Lowe and Carter are as promising as the radiant
Ambrose. "Swimming" is a wonderfully evocative title for this movie
of ever-shifting moods, suggesting Frankie's growing awareness that
when it comes to living her life, she's got to more than stick her
big toe in the water and instead jump right in and start swimming.</TE>

<HD>Desert Blooms With Music</HD>
<DH>Touring musicians play rare songs from South Africa's Karoo
region</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DINA KRAFT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The sound is a mix of scratch and soul once strummed on guitars made
of oilcans and catgut by shepherds, washerwomen and men walking down
roads in search of work.</LD>
<LD>   Only now, when it is in danger of dying out, has the music of the
Khoisan--indigenous people of southern Africa--come out of the nooks
of South Africa's Karoo Desert and found a national stage.</LD>
<LD>   In South Africa's answer to the Buena Vista Social Club, a group
of aging Karoo musicians has embarked on a sold-out national tour,
produced a CD and is exploring a documentary and tour abroad.</LD>
<TE>   Audiences have been giving standing ovations to the group's unique
tunings, chord shapes, and scratching and picking, which produce a
bent, melancholy twang.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent night in one of Johannesburg's premier theaters, a
sampling of Karoo Blues players shuffled onto the stage. They are
shepherds, retired farm laborers, men who worked on the railroad and
women who cleaned homes.</TE>
<TE>   Heads down and hands flying over the guitar strings, the musicians
played in a vibrant style merging African cycles and European
melodies, mostly borrowed from Dutch settlers, to create a sound that
has been compared to Cajun music.</TE>
<TE>   The music's quirky edge sprang from the players' isolation and
lack of formal training.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Coetzee, who gathers aloe for a living, developed his talent
during the long hours spent alone waiting for aloe plants to drain.
With nobody to accompany him on guitar, Coetzee, 58, decided to
accompany himself using a spoon in his mouth to play slide guitar
while his hands pluck and strum a complementary rhythm on the same
instrument.</TE>
<TE>   Another player, Helena Nuwegeld, 75, sings in a raspy, full voice
about her brother-in-law, who missed the train to work and stands
with a "handful of tears," trying to "raise 12 children with six
slices of bread."</TE>
<TE>   She garnered huge applause and laughs for another song about a
man's lack of sexual prowess.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians came together at the urging of David Kramer, 51, a
South African singer and songwriter who toured the tiny towns that
dot the wind-swept plains and low mountain ridges of the Karoo, in
western South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Kramer was inspired by the father-son team of
folklorists, John and Alan Lomax, who traveled the American South
collecting and recording blues and folk songs for the Library of
Congress. (Alan Lomax, the son, died this month at age 87.)</TE>
<TE>   Under the racist apartheid regime, the South African government
had no interest in exploring nonwhite cultures. In the 1970s, Kramer
feared that if he explored black shantytowns with a tape recorder, he
would meet the wrath of security police.</TE>
<TE>   "Ach, it was a stupid time," Kramer says, shaking his head. "You
were intimidated by the regime.... [The music] has never really been
acknowledged up until now. Because of the racism and oppression, it
was not considered worthy."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, while working on a documentary about Karoo guitarists
for South African television, Kramer took to the back-country roads
to find the musicians who helped shaped South Africa's folk music
traditions. The result is a CD, "Karoo Kitaar Blues," distributed by
JNS Music in Johannesburg. Kramer also plans to make a feature
documentary.</TE>
<TE>   He mourns what has been lost: the talented musicians who died
without recognition, and the songs that died with them.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing the last generation, just an echo of what the music
was. It's quite sad," Kramer says.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians speak of children and grandchildren more interested
in pop music on the radio than in the sounds picked out on homemade
instruments on store porches and in the fields.</TE>
<TE>   The Karoo musicians say no one really taught them how to play.
They looked on as an older brother or father played and eventually
picked up instruments themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a worn fedora and speaking with a soft lisp, Coetzee
speaks of going to the fields with his homemade "blik" guitar and
learning from a shepherd who kept one eye on the guitar, the other on
a herd of goats.</TE>
<TE>   Coetzee knew he was good, he says, but the tapes he sent out to
the cities were all rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of disappointment," he says. "I feel vindicated
now, being able to stand before a large audience and get a good
reaction.... At last there is something like real recognition."</TE>
<TE>   His face breaks into a sheepish smile. "I love the attention," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Nuwegeld, stout with a bright red head scarf, grew up in a musical
family. She sings with her brother, sister and husband accompanying
her on guitar and accordion. She writes some lyrics, improvises
others. Her words speak mostly of the harsh life in the Karoo.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think about my life, my parents and their life. I think
about how difficult it has been. I think about it and the words just
come out of me," Nuwegeld says.</TE>
<TE>   At this recent concert, the audience, made up mostly of white
South Africans, responds with wild applause, standing ovations and
even some tears.</TE>
<TE>   "They are hungry for it," Kramer says.</TE>
<TE>   The price of neglecting a culture for so many years cuts deep.</TE>
<TE>   "It touches something quite deep inside yourself, the loss of
opportunity through oppression," Kramer says. "You think, how could
this happen? How could we be part of a process of denial?"</TE>

<HD>At the O'Neill Center, the Process Is the Thing</HD>
<DH>Theater: For nearly 40 years, the Connecticut institution
has nurtured playwrights. Now a new team is at the controls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KUCHWARA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WATERFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>In the velvety darkness of an old wood-beamed barn, actors Chris Noth
and Mark Blum sit on a small, dimly lighted stage and rehearse their
lines.</LD>
<LD>   "Try to keep this next section clean--don't slur too much,"
cautions director Harris Yulin as veteran playwright Romulus Linney
stretches out on a nearby bench and listens. The play is called
"Klonsky and Schwartz," Linney's take on the argumentative
relationship between poets Milton Klonsky and Delmore Schwartz.</LD>
<LD>   Outside, underneath a mammoth copper beech tree, a similar
exploration is taking place. The play is called "The Bebop Heard in
Okinawa," the author a 23-year-old newcomer from Naperville, Ill.,
named Mat Smart. Half a dozen actors huddle around Smart and director
Steven Williford as they rehearse the young writer's turbulent tale
of a racially mixed family in present-day Okinawa.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly five decades--and a lot of theater experience--separate the
71-year-old Linney and Smart, but they are here at the Eugene O'Neill
Theater Center for the same reason: Both have written new plays.</TE>
<TE>   Each is taking part in the center's annual Playwrights Conference,
one of six major theater-related programs run on the grounds of the
old Hammond Mansion, a rambling yellow-frame structure that overlooks
Long Island Sound.</TE>
<TE>   "We are where things begin," says executive director Howard
Sherman, who is in charge of the entire operation. "We are not the
end. The O'Neill is a starting place."</TE>
<TE>   A starting place, over the years, for a lot of plays that went on
to have lasting lives on stage: works by August Wilson, including "Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom," "Fences" and "The Piano Lesson"; John Guare's
"The House of Blue Leaves"; Wendy Wasserstein's "Uncommon Women and
Others"; Lee Blessing's "A Walk in the Woods"; and the musical
"Nine."</TE>
<TE>   For much of its nearly 40-year existence, the center, which began
in 1964, was the domain of two men: founder George C. White and Lloyd
Richards, the first artistic director of the Playwrights Conference.
After a long, successful run, Richards left in 1999 and was succeeded
by James Houghton. White retired the following year, and Sherman
arrived in October 2000. Now, the new team is hard at work, slowly
putting its mark on the center and what it represents.</TE>
<TE>   The Playwrights Conference is the center's best-known program, but
the estate is also home to a music-theater conference, a critics'
institute for theater reviewers, a puppetry program, a residency for
trustees of nonprofit theaters and the National Theater Institute. It
is an accredited college-level training program for actors. The
institute's tuition helps cover much of the center's $2.4-million
annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   The center was named for O'Neill, whose family vacationed in
nearby New London and whose summer home there, the Monte Cristo
Cottage, was the setting for his "Long Day's Journey Into Night." The
center now owns the house and is in the process of restoring the
structure.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman, who has worked at such regional theaters as Geva in
Rochester, N.Y., and Connecticut's Goodspeed Opera House, oversees
them all. Yet artistic control of the Playwrights Conference is in
the hands of Houghton, who also heads the Signature Theatre in New
York and is an artistic advisor at the Guthrie in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 43-year-old Houghton, a soft-spoken, unassuming man,
who ultimately decided which writers filled the 15 slots--out of 700
or so submissions--in this summer's monthlong Playwrights Conference,
which ends Sunday. Then the music-theater conference takes over,
running Aug. 3 through 18.</TE>
<TE>   There is a three-tiered selection process, beginning with a letter
of intent from applicants, a biography and a character breakdown for
their plays. Scripts are read and evaluated by more than 50 theater
professionals before Houghton and a small advisory board make the
final decisions.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's 15 plays are a diverse lot and so are their authors.
Besides works by Smart and Linney, they include "Hindustan," which
deals with the love affair between Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime
minister of India, and Edwina Mountbatten, wife of the British
viceroy. It was written by William di Canzio, a college professor
from Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's "Millicent Scowlworthy," a look at how a group of
teenagers deals with the aftereffects of violence, not unlike
Columbine, by Rob Handel, a development director for the Mark Morris
Dance Group in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great things about this place is that there is all
this support--not only from the staff members, but from other
people," Linney says. "Jim sets a tone here so that there is no
competition. All the playwrights support each other."</TE>
<TE>   Linney was among several established playwrights asked by Houghton
to participate in this year's conference. They didn't go through the
selection process. Several other playwrights, including August
Wilson, were also present as writers-in-residence, able to work on
their latest efforts without the pressure of public performances.</TE>
<TE>   Those staged readings are put together quickly. The actors in each
show are at the center for a week. There are four days of rehearsal,
an afternoon of technical rehearsal and then two performances,
scripts in hand, in one of four theater spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "I am working here with people I really trust--I know these guys,"
Linney says of his director, his two actors and Houghton, who
presented a season of Linney plays at the Signature a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   It was Noth who suggested to Linney, a friend since they worked
together at off-Broadway's Ensemble Studio Theatre, that he write
something about Schwartz. Some two years later, "Klonsky and
Schwartz" found its way here.</TE>
<TE>   "We are able to do things that would drive other people crazy,"
Linney says, discussing the intense preparation for his two staged
readings. "People sitting here watching these rehearsals think the
whole thing is chaos, and we are all nuts. I have changed a million
things. There is a lot of give and take. Chris and Mark are ace
actors, and if you have any sense as a playwright, you pay a lot of
attention to what they are saying."</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about discovery," adds Noth, best known for his
television roles as a detective on "Law &amp; Order" and as Big on "Sex
and the City."</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to articulate for Rom--to help him find out what's
not working. Illuminating the different rooms of this play--and there
are a lot of them. It's good, hard work but it's scary."</TE>
<TE>   For Houghton, that cooperation is part of the process. He and
Sherman have instituted operational changes that are not readily
apparent to visitors or people attending the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "What I tried to do when I came here was to start fresh, to ask
some of the same questions that were asked initially when this place
began," Houghton says. "How can we serve our writing community now?
What are the challenges a writer faces in the field as it stands now?
And apply those answers and ask those questions every single year.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we can do is bring as many new people here as
possible every year so that we are constantly refueling and seeing
this event fresh, seeing it through a first-time experience.... There
are no givens except to be flexible and open to change."</TE>
<TE>   The playwrights now live on the O'Neill campus and can bring their
families. Originally, the conference employed five or six directors,
who would divide up the plays and hire what essentially became a rep
company of actors, who would be around for the duration of the
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, there is a director per project, and each show is cast
individually," Sherman says. "This made enormous artistic sense in
terms of giving each playwright the best resources for their specific
plays."</TE>
<TE>   Ask Smart, an O'Neill success story, who worked at the center for
two summers as a writer's assistant before submitting a play to the
Playwrights Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "The wonderful thing about having 'Bebop' at the O'Neill is that I
can have the appropriate actors in the roles," says Smart, who just
finished his first year in the master of fine arts playwriting
program at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Bebop" grew out of a summer visit to Japan and later a trip to
Okinawa.</TE>
<TE>   "In a school production, I wouldn't have a 50-year-old and a
70-year-old Japanese woman. I would probably have a 25-year-old white
girl. It's wonderful to have the people that I need to do the play.
It is empowering to have all these people working with you and just
trying to help you tell the story you want to tell."</TE>
<TE>   As Sherman explains it, "Everybody does workshops these days. You
can't turn around without someone telling you about their play
development series. What we offer is the idea that there are all of
these artists at varying levels of their careers here together in the
same boat and, ultimately, if they each choose, acting as resources
for each other. That's a very different dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the greatest experiences at the O'Neill come out of who
you sit next to at lunch--there are no barriers," he adds. "We all
walk around wearing name tags. It creates a leveling effect. Jim and
I wear them because it sets the tone. It says, 'If we can do it, you
can do it.' "</TE>
<TE>   On a recent cool, mosquito-flecked evening, Smart stood with his
actors under the same copper beech tree where they rehearsed for four
days.</TE>
<TE>   He smiled broadly as the crowd on bleachers cheered.</TE>
<TE>   A new play and a real playwright were meeting their audience.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pop-punker Ben Kweller hits a couple of emotional notes with such
accuracy and frequency that he ought to call his latest round of
concerts the Anger and Anguish Management Tour.</LD>
<LD>   Some musicians excel at venting rage, others at revealing hurt,
but Kweller is one of the few who can do both convincingly in the
same song, often within the same verse. And he's one of the even
rarer few who do so with instantly indelible melodic and lyrical
hooks.</LD>
<LD>   Working primarily from his solo debut album, "Sha Sha," on
Wednesday at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, the former frontman of punk
trio Radish cut a figure that was part young Pete Townshend, part
"Almost Famous" star Patrick Fugit. He jumped between piano and
guitar from song to song with help from a three-piece band that could
turn on a dime from alt-country to punk thrash.</LD>
<TE>   Fans who packed the club sang along with nearly everything, a sign
of the loyalty Kweller generates with songs that course through the
briar patch of life without sacrificing a sense of humor.</TE>

<LD>   Whither Thou Goest, Arthur, So Do They</LD>
<LD>   Steven Spielberg is hooking up with Tony To ("Band of Brothers")
to executive produce an eight-episode HBO miniseries about the life
of King Arthur from DreamWorks Television. And members of Parliament
from Scotland, Wales and the West Country are battling to promote
their region's ties with the legendary court in an effort to get a
piece of the action.</LD>
<TE>   In a motion tabled in the House of Commons, David Heath noted that
the king's "historical and mythological" connection with Somerset,
particularly Cadbury Castle and Glastonbury. He recommended the
"beautiful and unspoilt" countryside in the area as an ideal location
for filming.</TE>
<TE>   Upholding a Welsh claim, Paul Flynn called for a debate on the
motion, which he said contained the "dastardly and preposterous
suggestion" that King Arthur's court was located on a site other than
Caerleon, near Newport. Robin Cook, the leader of the Commons,
pointed out that many Scots believe the mythological hero was a
prince of Strathclyde. Fears of runaway production notwithstanding,
no American politicians have yet staked a claim.</TE>

<TE>   Missing Chagall Is Back Home in Russia</TE>
<TE>   The Marc Chagall painting stolen last year from New York City's
Jewish Museum is back on display at its home at the Russian Museum in
St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   The 1914 work, "Study for 'Over Vitebsk' "--valued at $1
million--had been on loan to the Jewish Museum as part of an exhibit
when it was stolen sometime after a museum reception on June 7, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, an undeliverable package was opened for
identification at a postal center in Topeka, Kan. Workers there found
the painting and, after noticing stickers from several museums on the
back, called the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Experts identified the painting in February, and its owner--an
unidentified, private St. Petersburg collector--requested that it be
returned to the Russian Museum, where it had been part of the
collection since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   It was returned last week, and was formally unveiled Wednesday.

<TE>   A New Ring Cycle (Apologies to Wagner)</TE>
<TE>   A composer has written a symphony for what may be the most
irritating instrument in the world.</TE>
<TE>   According to the BBC, Simon Turner's latest composition is "New
Ring Cycle," written for mobile phones--and masochists, of course. It
premieres at the Cheltonham International Music Festival in
Gloucestershire, England, on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Marcus Moore defends the venture, saying that cell
phones are far more than a means of communication. "They have got all
the different ring tones on them," he explains. "Each key makes a
separate little sound. It is a creative thing. At all concerts, the
one mobile phone that goes off is an anathema; here is one occasion
when we can harness those fascinating tones in a positive way."</TE>
<TE>   Squeezed between an exploration of the history of the cell phone
and a "celebratory finale" is a section encouraging audience
participation. "[It's] an opportunity for people to play with these
things and think, 'Hey, maybe I can compose something,' " Moore says.</TE>

<TE>   LEGAL FILES</TE>
<TE>   Settlement Reached on Destiny's Child Suit</TE>
<TE>   Two former members of the R&amp;B group Destiny's Child have settled
their lawsuits against the group's current members, its manager and
Sony Music. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, original members of the
group, quit Destiny's Child in 2000. They later sued lead singer
Beyonce Knowles, her father and group manager Mathew Knowles,
original member Kelly Rowland and Sony Music for breach of contract,
defamation, libel and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs left the group because of dissatisfaction with
Mathew Knowles, who took over after the original manager died in
1997. They were also unhappy about the 2001 single "Survivor," which
they contended was a violation of an agreement that precluded either
side from making disparaging comments about the other in public.</TE>
<TE>   Beyonce Knowles, who co-wrote "Survivor," insisted that the song
was about everybody who had ever discouraged the group.</TE>

<TE>   Agency Is Victorious in Suit Against Disney</TE>
<TE>   After deliberating for two days, a jury awarded Agency for the
Performing Arts $14.8 million Wednesday in its case against the Walt
Disney Co. At issue: packaging fees allegedly due from the ABC hit
"Home Improvement."</TE>
<TE>   APA, which represented the show's creator, Matt Williams, when the
series first aired, contended that it had been underpaid. According
to insiders, the studio will be responsible for 22% of the judgment,
with the rest to be picked up by other profit participants.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Disney said "there are solid grounds for appeal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   In a preemptive bid, Twentieth Century Fox has purchased the
motion picture rights to Michael Crichton's upcoming novel, "Prey,"
to be published by Harper Collins in November. The story is said to
incorporate themes previously developed by the author in "The
Andromeda Strain" and "Jurassic Park." Theatre L.A. will hold the
Ovation Awards at the newly refurbished, 2,000-seat Orpheum Theatre
on Broadway in downtown L.A. on Nov. 24.</TE>

<HD>Monkey See, Monkey Do at Svenson Exhibition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All forms of portraiture are based on the idea that it's possible to
capture that certain something that makes each of us unique. For a
painter or photographer, the goal is to make an image that comes
alive when viewers stand before it. That's also what happens when
children play with toys. Entire worlds appear in their imaginations,
where complex narratives unfold with the greatest of ease.</LD>
<LD>   At Jan Kesner Gallery, a series of silver prints by New York
photographer Arne Svenson links portraiture and playthings. Titled
"Sock Monkey, Sock Monkey, Sock Monkey," this terrifically silly
exhibition triggers sympathies that embarrass the hard-hearted and
cause sentimental viewers to gush.</LD>
<LD>   Each of Svenson's 33 photographs depicts the head and shoulders of
a sock monkey from the 17-year-old collection of New Yorker Ron
Warren. Posed against a black backdrop, no two look alike. Their
range of facial features, physiques and postures is wide--and
amazingly human.</LD>
<TE>   With a furrowed brow, floppy hat and close-set eyes half-hidden by
a bulbous nose, one resembles a grumpy chef whose beefy physique
makes it hard to tell where his shoulders end and his neck begins.
Another, with jingle bells for eyes, appears to be a dimwitted
sidekick who always sees stars because he's constantly knocking his
head against things. A third looks like a motley middle-manager whose
collar and tie are undone because it's well past quitting time and
his work is far from finished. And a fourth, whose ancestors could be
Curious George and Casper the Friendly Ghost, seems to specialize in
making a mess of things and then charming his way out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   A half-dozen wear the outfits and expressions of circus clowns.
Their demeanors range from amiable, fun loving and wholesome to dark,
sinister and menacing.</TE>
<TE>   Like the best portraits of people, Svenson's best portraits of
sock monkeys focus on sitters that seem to have complicated inner
lives. The standouts include a handful dolled up in garishly
patterned dresses, over-the-top hairdos, extravagantly stitched
eyelashes, and lips that never go out the front door without a thick
coat of lipstick--the brighter the better. Pinwheel eyes, fuzzy
earmuffs and larger-than-life smirks give them the presence of
eccentric aunts who drive the whole family nuts while still endearing
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As works of art, Svenson's photographs fall between David
Levinthal's Polaroids of emotionally loaded toys and Cindy Sherman's
pictures of herself decked out as women whose self-images are
profoundly out of sync with their physical features and social
positions. They also recall Mike Kelley's queasy installations, in
which hundreds of homemade stuffed animals are laid out on long
tables, as if for a bargain-basement sale or scientific study.</TE>
<TE>   As historical documents, they catalog Warren's 1,863 sock monkeys.
All are made from red-heeled cotton work socks whose design was
patented by Chicago manufacturer George Nelson in 1915. During the
Depression, people who used all types of socks to make homemade toys
preferred Nelson's brand because the red heels made such good lips.</TE>
<TE>   Svenson's exhibition demonstrates that the ordinary folks who
sewed sock monkeys were as adept at following directions as they were
at bending the rules. His potent pictures of their customized monkeys
pay homage to the thrift and ingenuity that once were an essential
part of American identity but now seem to be memories from a bygone
era.</TE>

<TE>   The Art of Utility as Practiced by Sam Maloof</TE>
<TE>   Sam Maloof's carved wood furniture is so breathtakingly beautiful
that it seems unreasonable not to call it art. But old habits die
hard, and we're not used to calling things we sit on, eat off of and
store our clothes in sculptures. In the popular imagination, art and
utility go together like oil and water. If something's useful, we say
it belongs to the world of craft.</TE>
<TE>   At the Beverly Hills Municipal Gallery in City Hall, "The
Furniture of Sam Maloof" brings together 24 gorgeously designed and
fabulously crafted pieces that the 86-year-old woodworker has made
over the last five decades. His user-friendly furniture makes no
grandiose claims about art and how we define it. Instead, it invites
viewers to redefine our ideas about usefulness.</TE>
<TE>   A pragmatist to the core, Maloof doesn't care if we define art too
narrowly. The real problem is that our definition of use is too
narrow to account for how we actually live with things.</TE>
<TE>   In the center of the gallery stand a casually elegant drop-leaf
dining room table and six upright chairs with leather upholstery,
from the 1960s. To their left is a simple cork-topped desk and
matching chair from the '50s. Maloof has softened their angular
austerity by rounding their corners and tapering the ends of the
desktop, which gives it the appearance of an aerodynamic wing. In
contrast, the eight tapered legs look plump and sturdy, both
down-to-earth and unpretentious. The marbleized pattern formed by the
cork top is framed by honey-colored maple, which Maloof has set off
with dark walnut highlights.</TE>
<TE>   Across the gallery, a desk hutch from the '70s stands like a
friendly sentinel, its doors, drawers and legs echoing one another to
form complementary rhythms that are not interrupted by any metal
hardware. Also made of dramatically grained walnut is a small, round
table from the '90s, whose four sensuously curved legs dovetail into
a single ribbed column.</TE>
<TE>   A squat hall cabinet, which does double duty as a bench and an end
table, suggests that utility means different things in different
situations. A pair of rocking chairs, one designed for a child, makes
you wonder where usefulness ends and relaxation begins. And two
extraordinary music stands demonstrate that one man's functional
object is another's luxurious indulgence.</TE>
<TE>   Made of Brazilian rosewood and accompanied by a sleek little chair
that looks light on its feet, a double music stand from 1972 is
profoundly anthropomorphic. Its outstretched arms hold two flanged
shelves for two musicians to set their sheet music on as they perform
side by side. The other one, made of maple, ebony and purple-heart,
has adjustable music rests that allow the singers to face one
another.</TE>
<TE>   Like all of Maloof's works, these serve a purpose. It just happens
to be one of pleasure rather than strict necessity. More important,
his pieces require participation on the part of the people who use
them. With built-in sociability, they aren't all that different from
sculptures or paintings, which also stimulate social intercourse by
bringing people together to experience--and argue about--all forms of
civilized refinement.</TE>

<TE>   Intimate Portraits From Bygone Era of Celebrity</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, when singer Robert Goulet showed up in Lancaster, Pa.,
for a United Way fund-raiser, 15-year-old Gary Lee Boas snapped his
photograph. An obsession was born.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 35 years, the painfully shy fan took more than
50,000 snapshots of stars and celebrities, with a few hundred
politicians, athletes and intellectuals thrown in for good measure.
At Karyn Lovegrove Gallery, 540 of these candid pictures are mounted
in tidy grids on six plain white panels. An exhibition checklist
(which is about the size of a small-town phonebook) identifies
everyone pictured and provides the date and location of the
photograph. Many are faded, slightly out of focus and less than
perfectly exposed. The result is a fascinating portrait of the
changing face of American fame and one man's undying obsession with
the glamour of celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Arranged in loose chronological order, Boas' little square photos
begin in 1968 and end in 1980, the year Mark David Chapman
assassinated John Lennon and the golden age of fandom came to a
close. One of the most amazing aspects of the old-fashioned fan's
awe-inspiring collection is the goodwill and trust embodied by the
vast majority of its pictures.</TE>
<TE>   In shot after shot, movie stars, Broadway legends, musicians and
TV heroes greet their fans with more gracious equanimity than we see
today. Nearly every celebrity patiently puts up with throngs of
autograph seekers whose hastily aimed cameras flash continuously.
Many smile politely, but more do so warmly. Others chat amiably,
while a good number go above and beyond the call of duty, hamming it
up for their fans as if they were actually enjoying themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Boas' pictures are not airbrushed fantasies or approved releases.
They occupy the real world, giving viewers a glimpse of the
unrehearsed sentiments and unplanned expressions that lie behind a
star's public image. Fatigue, trepidation, kindness, curiosity and
playfulness can be read on the faces of Boas' celebrities. So too can
confusion, amusement, arrogance and vulnerability. The distance
between stars and ordinary folks shrinks--but never disappears--in
these unadorned shots of those rare moments when fame and
facelessness come into contact.</TE>
<TE>   Although it would be foolish to describe Boas' portraits as
innocent--they depict, after all, publicity-conscious celebrities
just outside the backdoors of theaters, restaurants and studios--they
have nothing in common with the intrusive pictures shot by
professional paparazzi or the slick promotional fare churned out by
publicists. Their amateur charm is palpable and touching--and no
longer a part of public life in this country. Heightened security and
the corporate marketing of celebrity have closed the gap in which
Boas lived out his fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   A testament to a time when an ordinary guy (with an ordinary
Brownie Bullseye camera) could come face-to-face with fame, his
gigantic scrapbook is a piece of history that makes the present look
cold and heartless.</TE>

<TE>   Nick Lowe's Collages: The Look of Disorder</TE>
<TE>   Manic activity meets a strange sort of discipline in the
rambunctious collages and mural-size drawing that make up Nick Lowe's
solo debut at the Black Dragon Society on Chinatown's Chung King
Road. Each of the young artist's four collages, which range in size
from 20 to 50 square feet, looks like an elaborate mandala that has
crash-landed.</TE>
<TE>   An impressive inventory of oddly shaped and variously textured
bits of fabric, chunks of cardboard and scraps of paper form
out-of-whack patterns. These spindly shapes, which include passages
of lacy openness and tangled density, transform the symmetry of
Rorschach blots into chaotic free-for-alls filled with whiplash scale
shifts and jarring collisions of solid color. Sparks fly as Lowe's
high-octane cutouts fuse madcap animation and hard-edge abstraction.</TE>
<TE>   Yet all is not chaos amid the riot of mangled forms. Out of the
mix-and-match messiness emerges an order all the more poetic for
being unexpected. Loose, slippery and forgiving, the underlying
structure of Lowe's deliberately engineered compositions allows for
freewheeling improvisations that come close to spinning out of
control but never go over the edge.</TE>
<TE>   His colored pencil drawing is a fantastic dreamscape in which a
rock band plays a concert around Stonehenge-like ruins. A pyramid of
oversize human skulls, interspersed with glowing vocalists, stands to
the right. In the star-studded sky, electric zips, gaseous bubbles,
labyrinthine lines and upside-down snowmen provide the visual
complexity of the collages.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, ornamental works such as Lowe's were meant to
overwhelm a viewer's eyes with patterns so elaborate that
contemplating them induced a sense of serene well-being. In contrast,
his discombobulated images take your eyes on herky-jerky rides that
deliver anything but tranquillity. To look at them is to know that
there's no rest for the wicked--and even less for the virtuous.</TE>

<HD>If Nothing Else, 'Bears' Is a Warm Fuzzy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've been to Disney World more than once, you've probably
appreciated how useful that "Country Bear Jamboree" of singing
automated bears can be when you're trying to cool down young 'uns who
have been overstimulated by thrill rides.</LD>
<LD>   Still, no matter how cute those big, furry fellows can be, one
must acknowledge that they make up, at best, an appetizer or side
dish when compared with the other attractions.</LD>
<LD>   So why in Mickey's name would anyone make "The Country Bears"?
Because somebody found a story there somewhere. Although it's a
blatant rip-off of "The Blues Brothers," the idea of making the
beasts into a prototypical 1970s-style country-rock band that, as
with many of its real-life counterparts, broke up from being on the
road too long isn't a bad one.</LD>
<TE>   The opening montage of faded concert footage, faux Billboard and
Rolling Stone clips and sound bites from Willie Nelson is winsome and
clever enough as a self-contained entity. The movie could have
stopped there.</TE>
<TE>   But it doesn't. The story really begins with an 11-year-old cub
named Beary Barrington (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) whose obsession
with the long-defunct Country Bears makes him oblivious to the fact
that he is, in fact, an adoptive child of human beings.</TE>
<TE>   Only his older "brother" Dex (Eric Marienthal) seems to notice how
peculiar it is that bears walk and talk among us.</TE>
<TE>   And because he does, so does Beary, who sets off to seek his own
kind and, in the process, reunite the C-Bears for a reunion concert
that will save the ramshackle music hall in which they started. The
hall lies beneath the wrecking ball of one Reed Thimple (Christopher
Walken in gleeful sputtering mode), an evil banker with his own
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Only the very wee ones may be enthralled by the chase scenes, most
of which seem like outtakes from the old "Banana Splits Adventure
Hour."</TE>
<TE>   (There as here, other actors give voices to actors dressed in
funny costumes.)</TE>
<TE>   There are also musical numbers in which Krystal, Brian Setzer,
Queen Latifah, Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley show up to sing or watch
or do both. (You see, Raitt and Henley lend their singing voices to
two of the bears. You see.)</TE>
<TE>   After a while, the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to
get through "The Country Bears" is to ponder how a whole segment of
pop-music history has been allowed to get wet, fuzzy and sticky.</TE>

<HD>'Brooklyn' Serves a Slice of Italian With Vitality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols;F. Kathleen Foley;Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"There's two kinds of people in the world: Italians, and people who
wish they were." This observation typifies "West of Brooklyn," a 68
Cent Crew production at the Space Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Writer-producer Ronnie Marmo--who also plays emotionally isolated
protagonist Sebastiano "Sebi" Pascuzzi--sets the action in Los
Angeles, where transplanted Brooklynites scramble for a piece of the
Hollywood pie, usually at the pizzeria of paternal surrogate Papo
(the convincing Robert Costanzo).</LD>
<LD>   Others in Sebi's crew include his younger brother Jimmy (the deft
Jerry Ferrara), tough girl Donna (the vivid Angela Pupello), and
aspiring crooner Frankie (director-designer Danny Cistone).</LD>
<TE>   Into this expletive-laced atmosphere comes Madison (the delicious
Dany Daurey), a wealthy wounded bird with whom Sebi is instantly
smitten. A comedy of bad manners develops, until tragic events
imperil the romance of the attracted opposites.</TE>
<TE>   Cistone's staging impressively negotiates the tiny venue, his
inventive designs moving from the Hollywood Hills to the hills of
Sellinunte with brio. The cast is appealing, with Marmo and Daurey
generating palpable sparks, and their compatriots all authentically
amusing.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by audience reaction, such vitality counters the
discrepancies of Marmo's script, whose form and content expose its
screenplay origins. Act 1 counts 20 scenes, explicating information
more suited to subtext, and the tragedy's arrival at intermission is
jarringly melodramatic. But given the property's crowd-pleasing
properties, Marmo might just get a development deal, so he's already
ahead of the Tinseltown shell game.</TE>

<TE>   Picnique,' an Eclectic Hybrid of Wit, Whimsy</TE>
<TE>   In "Cirque Picnique" at the Sacred Fools Theater, Tina Kronis and
Richard Alger once again display the wit, whimsy and rigor that
distinguished "Dumbshow," their most recent previous production with
the Fools.</TE>
<TE>   It's no coincidence that the creative duo's production company is
named Theatre Movement Bazaar. The typical Kronis and Alger
production is a marketplace of movement--riotous, exotic and packed
with an eclectic display of goods. A hybrid of dance, theater and
performance art, "Cirque Picnique" was inspired by William Inge's
"Picnic," as well as other "Cold War texts" ranging from McCarthy
hearing transcripts to Betty Crocker commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The dialogue is nonlinear and cryptic, fraught with period
paranoia. A blank-faced woman pronounces, "My deepest fulfillment is
food preparation and housekeeping." Two men in suits react with alarm
to the sound of a ringing telephone. Three men, perhaps government
functionaries, obliquely discuss the prerogatives of power.</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds dry, it isn't. Kronis directs with firm hand and
tongue in cheek, lacing her austere staging with moments of telling
humor.</TE>
<TE>   Obvious lampoons of the era's gender stereotypes abound. To the
sound of snappy music, a man removes his perfectly starched white
shirt, only to reveal another white shirt underneath, and another and
another, in cartoonish succession. Prostrate women are picked up by
men and placed carefully on their feet, only to flop lifelessly to
the ground as soon as the men leave their sides.</TE>
<TE>   The production design by Kronis and Alger is first-rate,
particularly the sound, a perky blend of cha-cha and dissonance that
is an effective counterpoint to the atmosphere of underlying dread.</TE>
<TE>   A crack ensemble brings Kronis and Alger's creative vision to full
life.</TE>
<TE>   From the opening scene, in which the performers simply walk across
the stage at different gaits, to the more intricately choreographed
sequences, the actors display such precision and purpose, even their
eye movements seem syncopated.</TE>

<TE>   'Coming Attractions' a Satirical Sign of Times</TE>
<TE>   Manny Alter may not be the world's most successful talent agent,
but he knows potential when he sees it, and he currently sees it in
the novice gunman who's locked in a hostage standoff with police.
Manny figures that if he invents a creepy new image for the young
thug and sends him out to get a few murders under his belt, the kid
could be a star.</TE>
<TE>   The scary thing about this grim little scenario, as envisioned in
Ted Tally's early '80s satire "Coming Attractions," is that it's
awfully close to the truth. In a stylish revival by Theatre Neo, it
tickles some chilling laughs out of the American tendency to treat
criminals as celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   Tally's humor (which is sprinkled with brief musical interludes by
Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman) gets too goofy at times, and his
testing of boundaries sometimes steps over the line into bad taste.
But Matt Kirkwood's staging is so slick that the problems don't
stick.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Scarpino's blank-walled set places all of the action in
what looks, fittingly, like a television studio. Simple yet evocative
adjustments in David E. Miller's lighting and Jeff Scott's sound
design turn this artificial environment into everything from the
stage of the Miss America pageant to a seashore painted blood-red at
sunset.</TE>
<TE>   As Manny coaches his client to top billing in news reports and
orchestrates a fiendish appearance at that Miss America pageant,
actors Michael E. Dempsey, as Manny, and Tripp Pickell, as
fresh-faced killer Lonnie Wayne Burke, reveal some surprising
vulnerabilities. This helps to keep audience members engaged--even a
little empathetic--rather than just disgusted.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wittner draws the biggest laughs with some, um,
unconventional sign language as she speaks and signs her way through
a Miss America speech, while a gag involving an Arab terrorist
stand-up comic--performed by Greg Albanese--is so outrageous, given
the current world situation, that the audience is almost too stunned
to respond. Michael Merton, Courtney Vine, Ursula Whittaker and Karl
T. Wright provide solid support in multiple scene-setting roles.</TE>

<TE>   'Fairy Tale Engineers' a Hackneyed Adult Fable</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, in the land of Hollywood, the villagers of
Theatre of NOTE decided to enact a fable for adults called "The Fairy
Tale Engineers."</TE>
<TE>   The story was set in a puppet theater that had become a late-night
refuge for a sad young woman and a sad young man who worked there.
Hilda (Jennifer Ann Evans) clandestinely slept in the theater because
her home was haunted by memories of her dead lover, Fanny. Eddie
(Richard Werner) showed up in the wee hours to work on props and
effects for the puppet shows.</TE>
<TE>   In Hilda's dreams, Fanny (Rebecca Gray) returned to finish the
fairy tale that she had been writing at the time of her death. Eddie
was transformed into the story's protagonist: a young man who
ventures into the land of storks to try to acquire a baby. The tale
vaguely reflected their lives: Hilda wanted a child; Fanny was
noncommittal; Eddie had an outright fear of such responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the real-life writer, Brian Howrey, used hackneyed
allegories--about being the author of your life and making your own
kind of music--to tell his story. And for some unfathomable reason,
he called for long stretches of action to be performed in the nude.</TE>
<TE>   The arty pretentiousness worked like an evil magic, causing time
to pass at half its usual speed.</TE>
<TE>   Gray's performance as the frolicsome Fanny sporadically
reinvigorated the story, as did Ann-Giselle Spiegler's artful
direction. A giant set of stork wings--designed by John Palmer and
Jonathan Klein, and operated like a puppet--lent visual wonder, as
did whimsical Punch and Judy costumes that Sabrina Fiander-Benson
created for the show's all-purpose supporting players (Phinneas
Kiyomura and Claudia Choi).</TE>
<TE>   Yet while the villagers worked diligently to tell their story,
they weren't destined to live happily ever after.</TE>

<HD>How the Kid Stayed in Movie Business</HD>
<DH>The life of Robert Evans makes for a fascinating show
business story in the documentary 'The Kid Stays in the Picture.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Kid Stays in the Picture," a witty, colorful and poignant
account of the life and times of producer Robert Evans, takes its
title from a remark made by movie mogul Darryl F. Zanuck. With scant
acting experience, Evans had been cast as a matador in "The Sun Also
Rises," and so chagrined at this turn of events were Ernest
Hemingway, Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner and Eddie Albert that they sent
Zanuck a telegram demanding Evans' removal.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it was merely that Zanuck resented his judgment being
challenged or that it would be too costly to replace him is not made
clear. Zanuck might well have been impressed at how Evans had so
wholeheartedly thrown himself into the role, which had required three
months' training in the bullring. In any event, he retorted, "The kid
stays in the picture, and anybody who doesn't like it can quit!"</LD>
<LD>   Zanuck's words were a revelation and inspiration to Evans, who had
no illusions about his acting ability. In an instant, it came to him
that he'd rather be a Zanuck than a movie actor.</LD>
<TE>   "There are three sides to every story: my side, your side and the
truth. And no one is lying. Memories shared serve each one
differently." This observation from Evans kicks off this engaging,
imaginatively assembled and handsomely produced film memoir, and
directors-producers Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein clearly take
Evans' side.</TE>
<TE>   They work not only from Evans' autobiography of the same title,
but have Evans narrate his own story. Their approach is very much
like that of Maximilian Schell's memorable 1984 "Marlene," in which
the reclusive Dietrich is never seen outside film clips but is heard
throughout. Evans is every bit as vivid, funny, outrageous and
gallant as Dietrich was. Like Dietrich, Evans wants no one to feel
sorry for him.</TE>
<TE>   Where Schell had to re-create Dietrich's Paris apartment on a set
to evoke an atmospheric frame for his portrait of her, Morgen and
Burstein have had full run of Evans' Beverly Hills estate, Woodland.
His elegant refuge from the world for more than three decades, the
estate is the site of storied parties and romances, his security
blanket through his breathtaking rise to power in Hollywood, his
spectacular fall and his hard-won return to a position of respect.</TE>
<TE>   Evans' life unfolds as if it had been written by Harold Robbins.
Evans was born in New York in 1930 and was a child performer. At 21,
he joined his late older brother Charles in his hugely successful
women's sportswear business. (Charles, like his younger brother, was
also a charmer but in a lower-key way.) While staying at the Beverly
Hills Hotel on a 1956 business trip, Evans was lounging by the pool
when he was spotted by screen legend Norma Shearer, who thought he
would be perfect to play her late husband, movie mogul Irving
Thalberg, in "Man of a Thousand Faces" (1957). The movie starred
James Cagney in a film biography of protean silent star Lon Chaney.</TE>
<TE>   A movie magazine proclaimed that he dived into a pool and emerged
a movie star, and one magazine selected Evans the most promising
newcomer of 1957. He may have looked like a movie star, but he was
barely adequate as an actor. (His best performance, under Mike
Nichols' direction, is in a special reel prepared to persuade Gulf &amp;
Western's board of directors not to dump Paramount.) Although
continuing to prosper in the garment industry, Evans was determined
to become a movie producer, and based at Fox, acquired the rights to
Roderick Thorp's bulky, dense bestseller "The Detective," which
became a taut, entertaining 1968 thriller.</TE>
<TE>   But Evans withdrew from the project before it began filming to
accept a position in London as head of European production for
Paramount. The offer came from Charles Bluhdorn, the chief of Gulf &amp;
Western, which had just acquired the studio and had been impressed by
a New York Times profile of Evans written by Peter Bart, who was to
become Evans' right-hand man and is now vice president and
editor-in-chief of Variety.</TE>
<TE>   If the industry was surprised to discover that such a responsible
position was handed to Bart, a man who had never produced a picture,
that news was nothing in comparison to the impact of the announcement
that Evans had almost immediately been appointed head of production
back at the studio in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Evans wasted no time in validating Bluhdorn's instincts, for in a
few short years he moved Paramount from No. 9 at the box office--the
rock bottom position in the roster of major studios--to No. 1 with
such diverse films as "Rosemary's Baby," "True Grit," "Love Story,"
"Harold and Maude," "Chinatown" and "The Godfather," to name but a
few.</TE>
<TE>   The man who played Thalberg arguably equaled and maybe even
surpassed the achievements of the vaunted golden-era MGM production
head. (Whereas Thalberg ordered the butchering of Erich von
Stroheim's "Greed," Evans insisted that Francis Ford Coppola make
"The Godfather" longer.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the '70s gave way to the '80s and Evans stepped down from
head of production to a producing deal at Paramount and entered his
50s, he began to slip. The offer of some cocaine from an unnamed
"Hollywood princess" to ease his pain from sciatica propelled him
into a downward coke spiral, hastened by a drug bust and, worse yet,
the murder of one of his backers of the ill-fated 1984 "The Cotton
Club." Evans was never named a suspect in the case, but the
association with this shady character so clouded his reputation that
he was at last asked to leave the Paramount lot because no one wanted
to work with him.</TE>
<TE>   No one rises to the top in Hollywood without accruing detractors
and enemies, but Evans along the way also acquired staunchly loyal
friends. He persuaded Henry Kissinger to attend the New York premiere
of "The Godfather" even in the midst of a perilous turn of events in
Vietnam; Jack Nicholson bought back his cherished home for him; and
in 1991 producer Stanley Jaffe welcomed Evans back to Paramount,
where he remains to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Evans has dated some of the world's most glamorous women, but
having been married five times, has not been so lucky in love.
Clearly, he regards Ali MacGraw as the love of his life, and he
blames himself entirely for the breakup of their marriage, when he
neglected her badly to concentrate on getting "The Godfather" made.</TE>
<TE>   But Bob Evans is nothing if not a survivor--with his sense of
humor intact--and "The Kid Stays in the Picture" leaves us with the
feeling that in today's Hollywood it might well be impossible for a
colorful, glamorous gambler of such daring yet sure instincts to
flourish so fully--and that the movies are surely the worse for it.</TE>

<LD>Take Kirsten Dunst's 2000 cheerleader romp "Bring It On," give it a
hip-hop Hispanic make-over to attract the growing legions of young
urban Latino viewers and, voila, you have tonight's Disney Channel
movie, "Gotta Kick It Up" (8 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   But as formulaic as it may sound, the idea for the film didn't
come from the Mouse's marketing department but from the true-life
experiences of Meghan Cole, who with this effort makes her
co-producing debut.</LD>
<LD>   Prior to joining the Walt Disney Co., Cole was involved with the
nonprofit Teach for America program that places instructors in
under-resourced schools across the country. Cole, who has a master's
degree in education from Harvard University, landed at Nimitz Middle
School in Huntington Park, where she started the campus' first
competitive dance program.</LD>
<TE>   Although "Gotta Kick It Up" was "inspired by" her experiences at
Nimitz, the movie is set at fictitious Marshall Middle School, where
a new teacher (Susan Egan as Miss Bartlett), still brushing away the
ashes from a dot-com job that went down in flames, finds herself with
a whole new set of challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Talked into taking an after-school post as head of the dance team,
she runs up against some talented but undisciplined girls who she
must win over before she can begin the formidable task of molding
them into a team.</TE>
<TE>   The film feels a bit uneven through the first third, with some of
the conflicts seeming forced and the characterizations on the thin
side.</TE>
<TE>   But as the girls improve, the movie finds its own rhythm behind
the direction of Ramon Menendez ("Stand and Deliver").</TE>
<TE>   Helping things along is a strong performance by Camille Guaty as
Miss Bartlett's chief nemesis, Daisy Salinas. Guaty (from
Nickelodeon's "Raising Dad") is a talent to keep your eye on.</TE>

<HD>New Oscar Date Thickens the Plot</HD>
<DH>A February show could mean a shortened ad season. Then
again, studios might start campaigns earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The year's top Oscar-caliber movies might open in the fall instead of
December. Studios could begin mailing DVDs of their films to Academy
Award voters before the films even reach the theaters. And the
millions of dollars studios now spend on costly Oscar campaigns could
be whittled back.</LD>
<LD>   Those are some of the scenarios being sketched out by Hollywood
insiders after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
decision to move the Oscars up a month in 2004 as part of a two-year
experiment.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers of the annual Academy Awards show on ABC may wonder why
shifting the telecast from late March to late February is a big deal,
but in Tinseltown, it's enough to buckle, crack and shift the seismic
plates undergirding the movie industry.</LD>
<TE>   As it now stands, studios hold back some of the biggest and best
movies until December, believing that Oscar voters' memories are
short and wanting to cash in on bigger box office once the
nominations are announced early the following year.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Oscars moving to Feb. 29, 2004--a month earlier than
usual--the new date could have wide ramifications for studios as well
as Hollywood's two major trade publications, Variety and the
Hollywood Reporter.</TE>
<TE>   For studios, a shorter Oscar season could mean spending less on
marketing, but the downside is that they could see box office
revenues drop because of the shorter time between nominations and
awards.</TE>
<TE>   Most studios are greeting the shift with cautious optimism.
Indeed, a spokesman said this week that the academy was surprised
that not one studio voiced opposition to the planned move.</TE>
<TE>   It could be that the studios finally realize something needed to
be done to correct the flaws in the current system--call it
Hollywood's version of campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, which
released the Oscar-nominated "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," said a
shorter Oscar season would be "pretty positive" for studios small and
large.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts the emphasis on the films themselves instead of the
emphasis on many more weeks of campaigning," Barker said.</TE>
<TE>   As it now stands, he noted, "you have this long period of time
between the nominations and the awards. The longer period of time,
the more time people have to wage campaigns, and that shouldn't be
what it's all about. It should be about the movies, seeing them and
voting for what you think are the best."</TE>
<TE>   Russell Schwartz, president of domestic marketing at New Line
Cinema, agreed that the current awards season goes on far too long,
spawning more and more awards shows.</TE>
<TE>   "If this helps prune the awards tree," Schwartz said, "that would
be a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz, whose studio produced best-picture nominee "Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," said December is crammed with
Oscar hopefuls, but that could change once the Oscars move up a
month. He said studios might consider moving some Oscar hopefuls to
November or even earlier: They could peak by Christmas and then only
have a few weeks before the Academy Award nominations are announced.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think those movies deemed holiday fare will stay where
they are," he said, noting that the Oscar season wouldn't actually be
shorter, just readjusted.</TE>
<TE>   One of the academy's chief concerns is that any shortening of the
Oscar season allow enough time for voters to see the movies and for
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to tabulate the nomination and
final ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Some studios are mulling whether to send out DVDs and
videocassettes of their movies earlier than usual to ensure that
voters will see the films, but they also express concern that if they
send them out too early--before their theatrical releases at year's
end--they could fall victim to film piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Still to be seen is what effect the new 2004 date would have on
Oscar campaigning itself, particularly the glut of expensive "For
your consideration" ads that run in both Hollywood trade
publications, Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter, and have
spilled over into the mainstream press in the movies pages of The
Times and the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   This past season, the major studios spent an estimated $10 million
to $15 million on Oscar campaigns, even plunking down $100,000 a pop
for 10-page, full-color booklets touting their nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Studios spent more money on a single movie than ever
before on its Oscar campaign for "A Beautiful Mind," which went on to
capture best picture.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the studio spent about $3 million in trade advertising
alone for all of its films. But the film's eight nominations also
boosted its box office by as much as $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   What impact the earlier Oscar date could have on the trades is
unclear. Charlie Koones, publisher of Variety Inc., said it's too
early to tell how its publications' ad revenues would be affected.
"My early instinct is that the 'For your consideration' seasons will
move forward" into the fall, Koones said. He would not speculate on
what the Oscar move would mean to the ad revenues at either weekly
Variety or Daily Variety, which each have a circulation of about
36,000.</TE>
<TE>   Robert J. Dowling, editor in chief and publisher of the Hollywood
Reporter, which has a daily circulation of nearly 24,000 and a weekly
circulation of nearly 32,000, said removing a month from the Oscar
season, if that happens, would not have a significant impact on his
company's overall ad revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "if 30 days are taken out of the whole process,
then that's 30 days' worth of revenues that are probably going to
come out of my paper.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always looked at the Academy Award season as starting in
mid-November and going to the end of March," Dowling added. "If you
take 30 days out of that, that is obviously going to have an effect."</TE>
<TE>   He deflects criticism that Oscar campaigning in the trades has
gotten out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   "The promotion that goes on in the trades is a way of generating a
lot of interest [in the awards] in newspapers, Entertainment Weekly,
the 'Today' show, all around Europe and the world. It's a cascading
concept. It kind of starts with the trades. If you diminish the role
the trades play in this promotion, maybe less people will go to see
the movies. There will be less energy, less heat."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times' advertising department refused to comment
for this article. The New York Times did not respond to a request for
an interview.</TE>

<LD>Flashbulbs lighted up the stage as Liza Minnelli and David Gest
walked out dressed in dark colors and fashionably 45 minutes late to
their press conference Thursday at the House of Blues. They were
announcing their new VH-1 "musical reality series," which debuts in
October.</LD>
<LD>   "Liza and David" will be an "intimate" look at the star couple and
life inside their lavish Manhattan penthouse. "We're simple people,"
said Gest, seemingly without irony. Later, Minnelli added, "I won't
let anyone in the bedroom or the bathroom. You have to have some
privacy."</LD>
<LD>   Gest, a producer, and Minnelli plan to host dinner parties with
entertainer friends such as Dr. Dre, Usher and Mary J. Blige. When
asked if Gest's close friend Michael Jackson would make a cameo on
the show, Gest ignored the question.</LD>
<TE>   As Gest spoke, Minnelli fidgeted, giggled and clung to her
husband, clearly uncomfortable with all the attention from a crowd of
about 75 reporters, photographers and camera crews. "What am I most
nervous about?" she replied to one reporter. "You really want to know
the truth? This press conference."</TE>
<TE>   "We are two people who love to laugh, joke and enjoy each other's
company," Gest said in a statement. "When guests step into our house,
they become a part of our family. We both love every type of music
from hip-hop and pop to country and rock. We plan to introduce our
viewers to great music from every genre."</TE>
<TE>   Before the couple arrived at the West Hollywood club, Out magazine
senior editor Jeffrey Epstein found a seat in the front row. "I'm so
excited! I'm so excited! .... It's different from Ozzy.... You're
looking at a different demographic."</TE>
<TE>   Romanian TV reporter Andreea Marin, 28, sat nearby, detailing the
singer's popularity in the Eastern European nation. "Asking me about
Liza Minnelli," she said, quoting lyricist and Minnelli fan Fred Ebb,
"is like asking a child his opinion of Christmas." Her producer
Marius Daniel Popa added, "In Romania, they're crazy for her."</TE>
<TE>   Hawke's Fiction,</TE>
<TE>   With Elements of Fact</TE>
<TE>   Ethan Hawke is still a bit jet-lagged when he calls Los Angeles
just before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the same day his second novel, "Ash
Wednesday," hit stores. He recently returned from an eight-week visit
to China, where his wife, Uma Thurman, is filming a movie, their
daughter Maya Ray, 4, and infant son Roan by her side. Hawke sounds
eager to get the interview done. He calls 10 minutes early ("I
figured, why not get on with it?") from his home in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Ash Wednesday" is a love story told in dual narrative by a pair
of conflicted lovers--Jimmy, an AWOL soldier, and his pregnant
sweetheart, Christy, who meet in Albany, N.Y., and drive together to
Texas. Hawke admits that both characters possess shades of his
personality. But the 31-year-old author won't reveal which traits he
shares with the stars of his book. "You should talk to my shrink
about that," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The novel is dedicated to "Karuna," Thurman's middle name. Hawke
started writing it in 1997, long before marriage and children. "When
I started it, it was about something else," he says. But the story
emerged as his family took shape. "For the last few years, I felt
that in no way was I really prepared for all the emotional changes
that are asked of you getting married and becoming a father," he
said. "I came up with a story that I thought would be a good forum
for a lot of the emotional themes.... I'm basically taking a
three-year [personal] journey and condensing it into a one-month
[fictional] road trip."</TE>
<TE>   She's Still Welcome</TE>
<TE>   in the Hamptons</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart, the domestic goddess whose stock trading is under
investigation by Congress, will be honored for her charitable
contributions Saturday by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons with a
$1,000-per-plate gala at his home in East Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is being feted along with "Sex and the City's" Cynthia
Nixon, Black Enterprise magazine founder Earl G. Graves and Radio One
founder Cathy Hughes for helping support Simmons' pet charity, the
Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation's Art for Life, which supports
arts education for at-risk youth in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Event organizers expect to raise $850,000 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to celebrate Stewart apparently was made before
allegations of insider trading involving Stewart became public.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been a good friend to me and Rush Philanthropic over the
years and has helped us to fulfill our mission of providing at-risk
youth with access and exposure to the arts," said Simmons, founder of
DefJam Records and chief executive of Rush Communications, in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   A House committee is investigating whether Stewart sold shares of
ImClone Systems Inc. based on a tip from one of her friends, Samuel
Waksal, the drug maker's former chief executive. Stewart, head of
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., has denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Sightings</TE>
<TE>   In Section 12 of the Universal Amphitheatre at the Monday night
premiere of "Austin Powers in Goldmember" were Mary-Kate and Ashley
Olsen chatting with Jon Voight and his goddaughter Skyler Shaye,
Monica Lewinsky wearing a knit shawl and, separately, Jack Black.</TE>

<LD>IF ONLY THEY COULD SPEAK</LD>
<LD>   Stories about Pets</LD>
<LD>   and Their People</LD>
<TE>   By Nicholas H. Dodman</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   It used to be that pets were just pets, dogs just dogs, cats just
cats. Yes, we all loved most of them, but when they got sick or
cranky or unmanageable, we put them down, as the euphemism goes, and
went on to the next one. It was all a normal part of human life.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, Nicholas H. Dodman's "If Only They Could Speak"
can be read as a parody of human behavior in a nation where people,
awash in money, have swept aside the routine handling of animals in
favor of costly cures and experiments that can turn ordinary love for
animals into strange distortions of the human/pet relationship</TE>
<TE>   Dodman, a veterinary behaviorist in the School of Veterinary
Medicine at Tufts University and a popular writer and television
personality, presents us with a world in which people spend thousands
of dollars on the physical, and, increasingly, psychological, needs
of their pets, chiefly dogs and cats. Prozac abounds.</TE>
<TE>   A typical chapter in the book opens with a couple or single owner,
in great trepidation and anxiety, bringing their aggressive or
fearful or compulsive pets with them, hoping, at last, for a cure.
Dodman seems to be the court of last resort, the Massachusetts
General Hospital or, if you will, the Lourdes of pet problems.</TE>
<TE>   To the reader experienced with animals, many of the problems
Dodman is asked to solve have obvious solutions. You want to tell the
young man who, against all odds, is trying to civilize a pit bull to
give up; they are genetically disposed, sometimes fatally so, toward
aggression. (After months of trying, Dodman did tell the owner to
give up, and the animal was put to sleep.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there is a cat that is a cross between a Siamese and a Maine
coon cat. Don't get one; it is bound to be strange. (It was.) To the
woman who insists on giving precedence to a small, pampered dog over
its housemate, a large and dominant dog, the reader wants to shout,
"Don't even try! It means trouble!" (It did.)</TE>
<TE>   As "If Only They Could Speak" progresses, it dawns on the reader
that the pets described here aren't the only ones with problems.
Nearly always their owners have them too. Men and women who are
having difficult times with each other turn to pets for a bit of
solace. So do lonely people, so do people who have suffered losses
from death or divorce. So does, for instance, a woman consumed by her
successful career.</TE>
<TE>   It is Dodman's chief virtue that as a veterinarian he sees the
connections between owner and owned, master/mistress and pet. His
advice consists mainly in explaining to his clients who speak that
they cannot demand of his clients who do not speak that they be
something other than what they are.</TE>
<TE>   As all experienced pet owners know, the genetics of a dog or cat
set the general direction these animals will go and the bounds beyond
which they cannot stray. A retriever will retrieve; a herd dog will
herd; a guard dog will guard; a hound will hunt by scent; a terrier
will dig and furiously shake its prey.</TE>
<TE>   And certain breeds within these types will have pronounced
tendencies: pit bulls and Doberman pinschers are aggressive; chows
and cocker spaniels will bite; boxers may be compulsive drinkers of
water. Oriental cats of all types may be subject to compulsive
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Dodman's advice for dealing with difficult animals is sensible and
kind. Use rewards, not physical punishment. Never, never, as some
trainers do, lift a dog from the ground by a choke chain. For a
fearful or abused animal, use patience and gentleness. And always
remember it is the human who is in command. Never let the animal get
away with unacceptable behavior. Gently but firmly teach the beast
its limits, and it, and you, will be happier.</TE>
<TE>   Dodman can be eloquent on the joy a healthy relationship with a
pet can bring to both sides of the equation. "It is not a weakness to
develop a close and loving relationship with a pet," he writes.
"Quite the reverse: it indicates loyalty, caring and strength of
character."</TE>
<TE>   But he also wisely remarks during the course of the book that a
dog is, after all, just a dog.</TE>

<HD>A Rogue in Vogue</HD>
<DH>Hollywood maverick Robert Evans, subject of a documentary
released today, has always had a unique style</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'll show you what style is," purred Robert Evans in his melodious
growl as he ushered a visitor into the bedroom of his Regency Revival
home in Beverly Hills. Evans, the first and only actor appointed head
of a major movie studio, isn't talking about the room's velvet
appointments, or the mink bedspread--a gift from Alain Delon--or even
the autographed, oversized Helmut Newton prints hanging on his silky
walls.</LD>
<LD>   What's truly classy to Evans is a simple, plastic-covered booklet
that looks like a thin movie script. "This is something you can't
buy," he said, flipping open the hand-written letters of appreciation
from CAA agents he invited last week to his screening room to preview
a documentary about his life. "I learned something from this," he
said, reflecting on the meaning of the personal and thoughtful
gesture. "I appreciate this so much. That's style."</LD>
<LD>   If ever there was something that Evans personified, it's style,
that singular, seamless expression of character and aesthetics. His
hard-boiled speech, glamorous attire and cavalier ways make him seem
like a vestige from another era. Yet his suave manner is celebrated
today as buzz builds about "The Kid Stays in the Picture," the
bio-documentary, based on Evans' 1994 memoir of the same title, that
opens tonight in Los Angeles and New York theaters.</LD>
<TE>   Now 72, Evans has lost little of his movie-star looks, and even
less of his mostly-black, undyed hair, which sweeps the base of his
collar much as it did in the 1970s. His dark eyes twinkle beneath
blue-tinted Chanel blade sunglasses, one of dozens of fashionable
prescription glasses stored on special shelves in his mirrored
dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   Though they stretch tighter across his middle lately, his
signature shirts feature a button-down collar or covered placket,
mostly in solid silk or airy cotton. Today's is an elegant pistachio
silk charmeuse with a wing-tip collar, custom-made by Anto in Beverly
Hills. The slithery shirt, its straight-hem worn untucked, is
anchored by a silver bolo tie that he coaxed from a London belly
dancer--for $1,000. Though every article of his clothing seems to
have a fantastic story attached, it exists for one reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I wear is done as background to make me, as foreground
look good," he said, repeating what has become a trademark
expression: "Background makes foreground. That fits in film, it fits
in personhood, it fits in style, it fits in life. Don't forget it.
It's a good thing to remember. Whatever you do, let everything make
you look good."</TE>
<TE>   "He's outrageous," said Michael Viner, a neighbor who is president
of New Millennium Entertainment, which released the audio version of
Evans' book. "He's managed to go from icon to cold as ice and back to
icon again, with a lot of hard road in between."</TE>
<TE>   Married and divorced five times--wives have included Ali MacGraw
and former Miss America Phyllis George--Evans also plead guilty to
cocaine possession 1980 and was swept up in scandal when business
associate Roy Radin was murdered in 1983, though Evans was never
charged in connection with the crime. Then in 1998, he suffered three
strokes in two days that paralyzed his entire right side.</TE>
<TE>   "I was Quasimodo," he said, contorting his tanned face. He spent
three excruciating years learning how to walk, talk and function
normally, though he walks with an unsteady gait.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is basking in what he calls the best period of his life. As
Evans might put it in his characteristic Q &amp; A lingo: Best? Really?
Really. This from a guy who had it all--fame, fortune, women and the
chutzpah to revel in their many pleasures.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was a child actor, Evans had left entertainment to work
in his brother Charles' successful clothing firm, Evan-Picone in New
York. While conducting business poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel
in 1957, actress Norma Shearer plucked him from obscurity to portray
her late husband, movie mogul Irving Thalberg. Nearly a decade later,
the actor was handpicked by Gulf+Western owner Charlie Bluhdorn to
run production at his new property, the fading Paramount Pictures.
The job brought Evans scorn, praise and an insider's view of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   His perceptive and self-deprecating tales of studio life and his
years as a producer have made riveting entertainment. Audiences at
May's Cannes Film Festival and in Los Angeles screening rooms have
been soaking up the mogul's mannerisms that filmmakers Brett Morgen
and Nanette Burstein captured in their documentary. The audio book
version of his memoir, featuring his distinctive, dramatic narration,
has a cult following, selling a chart-busting 50,000 copies since it
was released in 1994. The typical audio book sells for six months,
Viner said, and becomes a bestseller at the 10,000 mark.</TE>
<TE>   On tape, or in person, Evans' 1,000-watt charisma still
illuminates every conversation, even though the topic rarely wavers
from his favorite subject--his incredible life. As aspiring Hollywood
power brokers absorb the tape's teachings, they've become fascinated
with the man who dated Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner, and always looked
sexy and suave, whether he was in tweed, velvet or cashmere
turtlenecks.</TE>
<TE>   To honor Evans, dozens of colorful cashmere sweaters stacked store
shelves last week at a Barneys New York party in Beverly Hills. With
sponsorship from luxury clothing maker Malo, fans and associates
toasted Evans and his fondness for cashmere, oversized glasses and
his other classic signatures. His debonair style lately has been
resurrected by menswear designers at Yves St. Laurent, Gucci and
Christian Dior.</TE>
<TE>   "His type doesn't get to exist anymore because we live in such a
P.C. world," said Simon Doonan, the creative director at Barneys New
York. "He's a flamboyant combination of macho and creative." In the
'70s, Evans usually left his collars open to reveal a manly thatch of
chest hair, an act unthinkable among today's waxed and glossy males.
Then and now, however, Evans has harnessed his seductive allure to
retell his life story--a feat that's helped put him in a producer's
chair at Paramount again and also rescued him from being thrown into
the trash heap of impolitic relics.</TE>
<TE>   Barneys captures that flair in a current window display on
Wilshire Boulevard, for which the producer lent heaps of framed
photos, eyeglasses, magazine covers, his Hollywood Walk of Fame
plaque, and memorabilia from movies that he produced on his own or at
Paramount--"Love Story," "Chinatown," "Rosemary's Baby," "Harold and
Maude," "The Godfather" and more. Prominent are large bottles of
Cutty Sark and J&amp;B, two signature libations featured in his screening
room, a place nearly as fabled as the Playboy Mansion, but more
refined.</TE>
<TE>   The house decor, like Evans' wardrobe, hasn't changed much over
the decades. Whether he's overseeing movie costumes and sets, or
hanging a picture, Evans' personal presentation and surroundings are
never accidental nor incidental. They're tools to maximize.</TE>
<TE>   "Style is a strange thing. It's a lot different than fashion,"
Evans mused in his audio book. "You don't need money for style."</TE>
<TE>   Such a swashbuckling person might be expected to be gauche, yet he
avoids heavy jewelry and flashy cars but he does have a butler. Only
his copper complexion seems out-of-sync. (Medications prevent him
from taking real rays, so he browns in tanning booths.) Evans favors
simplicity and restraint, a trait that first landed him on the
International Best-Dressed Poll in 1972, and three years later, won
him a lifetime spot in its Hall of Fame, alongside Fred Astaire, Cary
Grant and Giorgio Armani. Pulling a copy of the list and its rules,
Evans points to a pertinent sentence with pride:</TE>
<TE>   "Each annual poll selects 12 women and 12 men who most vividly
symbolize excellence in dressing for contemporary life without
extravagance or ostentation but with distinction and influential
flair." He nods at the words "without extravagance," because Evans is
keenly aware that he's not fashion victim.</TE>
<TE>   "Any man who wears a label on the outside, I don't understand," he
said. "I don't want to be in Ralph Lauren's pants," he said, bursting
into a throaty laugh. "People may say I have a weird way of putting
things together, but it's my own."</TE>
<TE>   Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair and the producer of "The
Kid Stays in the Picture," described his friend Evans as "the last of
a dying breed." Most studio executives today look like--and
are--accountants. "And Bob does not look like an accountant," Carter
said, "He looks like a movie-star version of a Hollywood studio
chief."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Evans discovered customizing. "In clothing, I have a
very specific style," he explained. "It's really very simple. I have
one of everything," he said, leaving out a salient detail. He has but
one silhouette, that is, one style of flat-front, uncuffed,
on-seam-pocket pants. Period. One style of raglan-sleeve,
besom-pocket, three-button, single-breasted jacket. Period. One sleek
Bally slip-on black shoe (and a few variations). But everything is in
different, soft colors and lush, tactile fabrics, all custom-made
either by experienced shirt makers or a longtime seamstress, whose
name he doesn't volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wear this in the morning. I wear this in the afternoon. I wear
this in the evening," he said of his trademark ensemble. "I wear it
to a ballgame. I wear it to a poker game. I wear it to a black-tie
party. I never wear a tuxedo. I have a velvet jacket that I had made.
It's a style unto itself and it took me eight months to design one
jacket."</TE>
<TE>   He once considered selling a clothing collection based on his
wardrobe, including the jacket, which is as weightless as a shirt and
as unstructured as a cardigan. He decided he wanted no one else to
look like him. Not that they could.</TE>
<TE>   Though they're classic cuts, Evans' animates his simple, silky
shirts and sweaters with a sexy swagger all his own. Yet they're also
dead-on perfect. Doonan called Evans "sartorially self-obsessed," the
kind of man who personified the glamorous life of a movie mogul. "Our
customers are from ICM, UTA, CAA [talent agencies] and they idolize
this guy," Doonan said. "As an actor, he knew that trappings were
important. He knew the value of presentation."</TE>
<TE>   Evans takes it all lightly. "It's nothing new or studied or an
affectation," he said, insisting that he's never bored with his
pared-down wardrobe. "You know why?" he asked. "Because it's
background."</TE>

<LD>I wept as I read about Jerry Melton. What a role model! ("For Best
Teacher in a Supporting Role," July 19).</LD>
<LD>   Melton influenced hundreds of adolescents--as a surrogate parent,
a mentor and a teacher. His actions spoke as loud as his words. He
drove students home, to venues where they could get valuable
experience, took them to dinner, created successful participatory
experiences for generations.</LD>
<LD>   He demonstrated clearly that the kind of attention we get in our
formative years lives with us forever. His students came to remember
him, to share stories about him, to name the school auditorium for
him.</LD>

<LD>Ijust wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you for your poignant
portrait of Morris Kight and his retirement from the L.A. County
Human Relations Commission (Al Martinez column, "L.A. Gay Rights Icon
Loud, Proud, Moving On," July 22).</LD>
<LD>   As a 25-year-old gay man who sometimes feels like my generation is
too busy living in the present to concern themselves with the
importance of our past, I always greet any acknowledgment of our
civil rights pioneers with the greatest of appreciation.</LD>
<LD>   It is through their blood, sweat and tears that people like myself
get to live in such relative freedom and are inspired to continue the
tradition of fighting for what is right.</LD>
<TE>   Thank you, Mr. Kight, for your unwavering dedication to our
community.</TE>

<HD>Airing 911 Tape Was an Offensive Decision</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I believe the press should have access to information and the ability
to publish information that will increase our understanding of
issues. The 911 tape did not need to be public ("Better to Have Left
911 Tape Unheard," July 24). It did not add to our understanding of
the Samantha Runnion tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   This tragedy left me feeling great sympathy for Samantha's family
and friends. I know many people felt a personal connection, and that
made the airing of the tape more offensive as it invaded the privacy
of those people who should be shown compassion at this time.</LD>
<LD>   It was an offensive and repellent decision on the part of the
media.</LD>

<HD>Journalists Need to Investigate Entire Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The issue regarding the media taking partial responsibility for the
current furor [over the videotape of the alleged beating of a teen by
Inglewood police] (Al Martinez column, "Don't Like Bad News? Blame
the Messenger," July 18) is entirely justified because, in most
cases, supposed journalists are the ones fanning the flames.</LD>
<LD>   Does the media have the right to do that? Sure--if it has the
entire story. But in this case, it (the media) and we (the public) do
not have all the details--especially the part of the story that comes
before the tape began rolling.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Crooks would never be confused with being a journalist
either, so taking the tape to "authorities" (read: the media) maybe
seemed like the best avenue for him (read: get back at the cops). But
the media (journalists, real journalists!) had the responsibility to
investigate the entire story before splashing the videotape on the
air as if it were just another segment of a reality show.</LD>
<TE>   Mr. Martinez, you and your cause would be better served if you and
your ilk rose above primitive knee-jerk emotional ranting and put
more effort into finding out what actually happened.</TE>

<HD>Literary Leader Emerges in a Culturally Fused World</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not long ago, fusion cuisine and music seemed daring and exotic. Now,
both are unremarked-upon staples of American life.</LD>
<LD>   Fusion literature is the next new thing. Think of it as aesthetic
blow-back the unlooked-for but delicious consequence of American
popular culture's globalization.</LD>
<LD>   Rayo--an imprint of HarperCollins--is one of the publishers in the
movement's forefront, and this week it signed the edgy young Chilean
author Alberto Fuguet to a two-book deal. Fuguet's new novel, "The
Movies of My Life," which Rayo will publish in both English and
Spanish, chronicles the family life of Beltran Niemeyer, an
Encino-raised Chilean seismologist whose sense of reality derives
from American B-movies such as "Earthquake!" and "Jaws 2." Fuguet's
second book will collect a cycle of linked short stories titled
"Hecho in the USA."</LD>
<TE>   "Fuguet is a leader in the new wave of young Latin American
authors," said Rene Alegria, Rayo's founder and editorial director.
"Together, they are breaking the long-held stereotypes of what Latin
American literature is. Fuguet demonstrates perfectly the bizarre
cultural union which has only recently begun to weld together the
aesthetics of North and South America."</TE>
<TE>   One of the hallmarks of this new wave, according to Alegria, is
its recognition "of American popular culture's amazing power to
infiltrate all parts of the world." Fuguet is a particularly
knowledgeable spokesman for that viewpoint, since he spent his
childhood and early adolescence in the San Fernando Valley until his
family returned to Chile. "Growing up in Encino and then going back
to Santiago, he comprehends pop culture's American origins," said
Alegria. "He also understands how it is imported into other societies
and then transformed there in wildly unique ways. McDonald's, Nike,
Michael Jordan in all their complexity are now amazing global
presences. This fact has the power to elevate or depress, depending
on your viewpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Editorially, Rayo's own point of view represents a
Latino-inflected synthesis of cutting-edge writing from both
hemispheres. Among its American authors is Los Angeles' Yxta Maya
Murray, whose forthcoming novel "The Conquest" already is gaining
unusual attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not even a year old yet," said Alegria. "The first of the
20 books we've published so far went into the stores last September,
but we've already had two national bestsellers. I think our long
invisibility as Americans created a kind of creative trench in which
so many of our writers blossomed and from which they're now emerging
fully formed and ready. We're trying to publish them in the way they
should be published. That is to say, without losing sight of the fact
that Latino American writing is, in the end, very American."</TE>
<TE>   Fuguet is well known in Latin America as the editor of "Se Habla
Espanol: Voces Latinas en U.S.A,"  an anthology of young writers from
throughout Latin America who identify themselves as members of
"McOndo," a playful conflation of the fast-food chain and Macondo,
the fictional city in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's magic realist classic
"One Hundred Years of Solitude." The anthology collects nonfiction
pieces on the authors' experience of the United States and, in some
cases, their view of U.S. Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The Chilean writer "has been anointed by many of these writers as
the leader of their movement," said Alegria. "Alberto certainly has
been the most vocal among them. Their influence already is being felt
among the young Mexican writers, who call themselves the Crack
school--for its position on cultural fault lines--and who have
adopted the same literary ideology as McOndo. Basically, they are
trying to capture what is real in contemporary South America and to
bring its literature out of the shadow of magic realism. There's a
great deal of joy in their writing. They understand that the
globalization of art and culture destroys, and yet is so much fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Alberto is an apt example of this school, which is the first to
capture what the world of letters is really going through," Alegria
said. "It is an experience that has not been focused upon, this
creation of a new sensibility by the merging of North and South in
the Western Hemisphere. The truth is that, today, you can travel from
Santiago to Encino and--whether you speak English or Spanish--feel at
home."</TE>
<TE>   California Coast's Got</TE>
<TE>   Another Steinbeck</TE>
<TE>   Few names exert quite so powerful a claim on California letters as
that of John Steinbeck.</TE>
<TE>   It is testimony to his books' enduring power that, when we think
of him, we mentally identify Steinbeck first as author of "The Grapes
of Wrath" rather than as "the Nobel laureate."</TE>
<TE>   His first published book, "The Pastures of Heaven," which appeared
in 1932, was a closely linked collection of short stories. So too is
the first published fiction by his eldest son, 58-year-old Thomas
Steinbeck. Forthcoming from Ballantine in the fall, the book is
titled "Down to a Soundless Sea." It is a volume of seven vigorous
and artful stories whose common theme is life in and around the
Monterey Peninsula during the early 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Steinbeck, who lives with his wife, Gail, on the Central
California coast, is a longtime screenwriter, cinematographer and
photojournalist, who began his career reporting from Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted anyone to think I was in any way trying to compete
with my father," he said. "He was such a large figure and cast such a
deep shadow. But about 2 1/2 years ago, I began writing these stories
in earnest. Then, I had to turn back to screenplays, which I hate,
since it's like writing the directions for a VCR--and about as much
fun to read."</TE>
<TE>   When the stories finally were finished, Steinbeck said, "I told my
agent, 'This is never going to sell.' The stuff is just so regional I
still can't imagine that anybody from north of San Jose or south of
San Luis Obispo will want to read it. But one thing led to another
and I got a two-book deal. This is the first, and I'm already at work
on a novel to follow."</TE>
<TE>   It too is set mainly on the Central Coast, though this time in Big
Sur. "It's the chronicle of several generations of an Irish family
that repeatedly tries to come to America, but is frustrated by
various historical events until the last generation, whose members
arrive on the Central Coast at the turn of the century," Steinbeck
said. "In those years, it was a very remote place. Big Sur might as
well have been an island in the middle of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "It also was a period in which the last of California's real
innocence was passing away. The story ends at the time of the
anti-Japanese riots in San Francisco in 1901. In the largest sense,
the book's theme is that the joy is in the wanting, because when the
family arrives in Big Sur and takes up ranching, they find their
struggle is much more than they expected.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent most of my youth hanging around the Big Sur, and I
understand the ranching life there. 'Men break and boys bounce,' they
used to say. It's the roughest cowboying in the world. So, this novel
is about the joys and trials of freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress:</TE>
<TE>   An Ancient Love Story</TE>
<TE>   Nicaraguan writer Giocanda Belli is author of three novels, five
poetry collections and of "Country Under My Skin," a memoir,
forthcoming from Knopf, of her part in the Sandinista movement. She
lives in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "I am quite at the beginning of a new novel. I have found an
interesting story, a love story that takes place in the Middle Ages.
It involves the Spanish queen, Juana la Loca [Juana the Mad],
daughter of the king of Castile. Her husband was Filipe the Fair, who
was the son of Maximillian of Austria. They have a torrid love affair
in which jealousy plays an important part. This jealousy, in fact, is
supposedly the cause of her madness.</TE>
<TE>   "So, I have been doing a lot of research on the Middle Ages,
reading and listening to lectures. It is a fascinating plunge into
that time period. You can really see how so many aspects of modernity
were slowly coming into being in those times. Politically, it is a
very interesting period. I also have become quite fascinated with the
Catholic queen, Isabella of Castile. She was an amazing woman."</TE>

<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>It's not just bikinis anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Rio Fashion, the weeklong show that started Monday and runs
through Friday, is perhaps the most convincing demonstration yet that
the city famous for dressing women in dental floss can provide more
ample coverage.</LD>
<LD>   From Carlos Tuvesson's crystal-encrusted evening wear to the
home-grown fashion statements of Coopa Roca, a clothing collective
based in the city's biggest shantytown, Rocinha, Rio designers made a
convincing case they could hold their own in the fickle world of
fashion.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very important this event is happening here in Rio. The city
has everything to do with fashion," said Paulo Skak, president of the
Brazilian Assn. of Textile Industries. "I have the feeling that this
is the first big event of the fashion world in Rio that will be very
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Model Gisele Bundchen, the woman who almost single-handedly put
Brazilian fashion on the map, was conspicuously absent, after
parading in the Sao Paulo fashion shows that ended Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion week in Sao Paulo typically gets more attention with
presentations from Fause Haten, Tufi Duek, Lino Villaventura and
other designers.</TE>
<TE>   But in a sign that Brazilian fashion is picking up international
fans, top model Naomi Campbell was on hand to model--what
else?--bikinis by Lenny.</TE>
<TE>   The other top Brazilian models--Caroline Ribeiro, Ana Hickmann and
Adriana Lima--were out in force.</TE>
<TE>   "Gisele is Gisele and no one is going to be Gisele. I am really
happy where I am and I am really happy with my job," Ribeiro told
Associated Press Television News.</TE>
<TE>   Hickmann said the show was like a homecoming for her.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very nice feeling to come to a big event like this in
Rio, to be recognized, people see you and know your name and things
like this are very nice," she said.</TE>

<HD>A Modest Proposal: Alert the Unbuttoned</HD>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I just wanted to share a cautionary tale with
other women out there. Last week, while running from one meeting to
another, I stopped in to a coffeehouse. After I placed my order I
made conversation with other men and women waiting for their drinks.
Later, one of the servers--a young man--waved me over. Smiling, he
pointed toward my blouse. I looked down to see four buttons open, and
my bra revealed.</LD>
<LD>   I thanked him profusely and then turned to the woman to whom I'd
given my order: "Why didn't you tell me?" I asked. She replied
matter-of-factly, "I thought you wanted it that way." I shared this
story with a friend over lunch who had a similar experience. While
she was walking around a mall, unbeknownst to her, her black bra was
on view to the world. Not a soul told her.</LD>
<LD>   Mind you, I'm not Britney Spears or J-Lo, just a drone going
through my day. But it seems that in this land of decollete and
midriff-baring tiny tops, we can't rely on our old checks and
balances if something goes awry. And just out of curiosity, is there
a polite way to let someone know that she may be showing more than
she thinks?</LD>
<TE>   --STILL BLUSHING</TE>
<TE>   Dear Still: While we can't help but raise an eyebrow or two over
your adventures in near-nakedness, we have to admit we're not that
shocked. While driving the other day we saw three young women walking
down the street with pants so low and shirts so cropped that not only
were great segments of their tummies revealed, but most of their
backsides as well. How any of these women left the house thinking "I
look awesome!" is a complete mystery to us.</TE>
<TE>   That's why we're not hyperventilating over your incident. It's
unfortunate that only one caring soul took it upon himself to clue
you. But it's excruciatingly obvious that our culture is so used to
seeing semi-clothed people that a woman with her blouse open doesn't
engender much outcry. And that's too bad.</TE>
<TE>   We're sure that among those getting an eyeful were some who
thought about telling you your blouse was unbuttoned, but decided to
keep mum in case this was a look you had carefully planned out. These
may be the same people who, when seeing young men in oversized pants
slung low enough to show a great chunk of colorful boxers, want to
scream, "Hey! Your pants are falling down!" But they don't, fearing
being mistaken for the poster child for un-hip dweebs.</TE>
<TE>   Our advice to those who think someone may unwittingly be revealing
more than they'd like is to take them aside and say, "Perhaps you
don't know, but your blouse is open." If that is met with withering
glances, just smile and say, "Have a nice day." Either way, you've
done a good deed.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: What should an older lady wear to a San
Francisco summer picnic in the park? The afternoon event is part of a
wedding weekend. The wedding is in a chapel but this would be before
or after the event. I imagine it will be a small group, 50 to 75
people.</TE>
<TE>   --UNCLEAR ON</TE>
<TE>   THE CONCEPT</TE>
<TE>   Dear Unclear: It's becoming more and more common for couples to
plan a weekend or week's worth of events around their wedding. The
reason behind this is that the bride and groom often invite friends
and family members from out of town, or out of the country, and to
make the schlep more worthwhile and fun they add events such as
brunches, parties and showers.</TE>
<TE>   Considerate brides and grooms often print up an itinerary with
appropriate attire for each event so no one has to guess what to
wear. We assume that was left out in your case, so we'll try to fill
it in.</TE>
<TE>   Since San Francisco weather this time of year can be sweltering or
chilly--or both--we recommend wearing clothes you can layer. A jacket
or sweater over a blouse or dress is ideal, allowing you to add or
remove pieces as necessary.</TE>
<TE>   We suggest you keep your style fairly casual, since this is a
picnic. A cotton or linen skirt, dress, or pair of pants is a good
place to start. Choose items that allow you to move since you'll
probably want to mingle. Look for loose-fitting slacks or a roomy
skirt that falls mid-calf. Cottons with a bit of Lycra are very
comfortable. We hope the hosts have provided picnic tables, but you
should be prepared for the possibility of funky chairs or benches or
sitting on blankets on the ground. Wear flats so that your heels
don't sink into the ground, and bring a hat in case there's a dearth
of shade.</TE>

<HD>The Grandeur of the Groves</HD>
<DH>A pause to consider transcendence as flames near the giant
sequoias</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sped by hot canyon winds, fueled by dry underbrush, the wildfire
ignited swaths of Sequoia National Forest--and then began closing in
on its ancient heart. On Thursday, the blaze had moved within two
miles of a trail of giant sequoias, close enough for one expert to
raise a stunning possibility: The grove could go up in flames.</LD>
<LD>   "If fire does get in the Trail of 100 Giants, we won't be putting
firefighters in there to stop it," said Jim Paxon, a spokesman for a
national team of elite firefighters who were on the scene. He added
in the interview with the Associated Press: "It will be a climax of
300- or 400-foot flames."</LD>
<LD>   In this unrelenting and deadly fire season, the potential scenario
prompted a pause to consider the unthinkable. The blaze grew by noon
to more than 57,000 acres, and advanced toward iconic places of
pilgrimage--besides the Trail of 100 Giants, 10 groves of sequoias
were within a mile or so of the flames. In California, the threat
took on a personal tone, renewing a proprietary interest in the giant
sequoia, which, along with the coast redwood, is the state tree. The
sequoias always have been beloved in this state, where they are known
by name and forever immortalized by John Muir who described them as
"nature's forest masterpiece, and, so far as I know, the greatest of
living things."</LD>
<TE>   "They have been a core of California's identity since California
became a state," said Ruskin Hartley, conservation planner for Save
the Redwoods League, a San Francisco-based nonprofit. "Those massive
columns reaching for the sky are really a sight to behold....The
trees just stand there, timeless, removed from the bustle of our
everyday lives. There's something very spiritual about them."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Forest Service spokesman told reporters that saving the
"priceless" trees was a top priority. But by Thursday afternoon,
despite the efforts of more than 1,500 firefighters and 10
water-dropping aircraft, the fate of the groves remained uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Only 70 or so groves survive, all on the western slopes of the
Sierra Nevada. (In the forest's Giant Sequoia National Monument, the
Trail of 100 Giants is part of a grove that includes 268 sequoias,
ranging in age from 500 to 1,500 years old). Giant sequoias are the
largest trees on Earth and among the oldest living things. If you
have never stood in the humbling shadow of the trees, the way
generations of schoolchildren have, it is hard to imagine the
grandeur of the groves. The biggest trees are as tall as a 26-story
building and as wide as many city streets, with names weighted with
history and power: Washington, Genesis, King Arthur.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas D. Piirto, a forestry professor at Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, recalled the first time he realized the stature that the
state afforded the trees. In the early 1970s, as a doctoral candidate
at UC Berkeley, he got a call from a concerned National Park Service
official. Could he figure out why a few giant sequoias had come down?
Working with a university professor, Piirto discovered that the
culprit was a disease in the root system of the trees.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the Sierra Nevada, the reaction was telling, said
Piirto, who is a member of the Giant Sequoia National Monument
Scientific Advisory Board. "People said, 'Giant sequoias live
forever. Nothing attacks them.' "</TE>
<TE>   This week, though, the raging wildfire swept away enduring
misconceptions of the trees' immortality. Though the thick tree
trunks have withstood countless fires, this blaze could prove to be
fatal, Forest Service officials have acknowledged. Pushed by erratic
winds, the intense flames have the potential to leap to the upper
limbs of the giant sequoias and engulf their entire crowns. But
they're powerless to strip away the still, central place the trees
hold in the consciousness of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Artists have long tried to capture their ethereal nature. In
"Leaves of Grass," Walt Whitman mourned and celebrated the giants: "A
California song,/A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to
breathe as air,/A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads
departing,/A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and
sky,/Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense ..."</TE>

<LD>The young albatross flapped his wings hard and stretched upward. Then
he took a short run forward and rose a few feet into the air.</LD>
<LD>   "He's going to make it!" Sally cried, jumping up and down.</LD>
<LD>   Then thunk! The chick landed back on the ground again.</LD>
<TE>   "Try again!" Peter said. "You can do it!"</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Stanley put his hands on the children's shoulders. "It isn't
easy for him, but I think he'll make it. If he can just get to the
edge of the cliff."</TE>
<TE>   "He won't give up," Fran said. "He'll keep trying until he gets
there."</TE>
<TE>   Once again the fledgling took a short run, flapping his big wings
until the wind from the sea lifted him up and carried him several
yards. Then thunk! Back on the ground again.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to do it," Peter said. "He went quite far that time."</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Stanley, Fran and the children moved closer but not too
close in case they scared the young albatross. He flew again, several
yards more. Then again, almost twice as far. The third time he landed
at the very edge of the cliff.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh dear," Sally cried, "he'll fall off!"</TE>
<TE>   She started to run toward him but Uncle Stanley pulled her back.
"He'll be all right, Sally," he said gently. "We can't help him
now--we don't have wings! See, there he goes!"</TE>
<TE>   This time the albatross faced straight into the wind and rose up
into the air. They watched him glide over the cliff for a moment and
then swoop down to the blue Pacific waters below.</TE>
<TE>   "Goodbye, gooney bird!" Peter shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "Aloha!" Sally called. "Goodbye for now and hello next year when
you return to build a nest for your family!"</TE>
<TE>   Eve Begley Kiehm has studied the albatrosses that live on the
island of Kauai in Hawaii. There is a large colony of them at the
Kilauea Lighthouse. A few "loners" have their nests in the cliffs.

<HD>State Targets Offshore Companies</HD>
<DH>Investing: Angelides unveils a blacklist and asks two
major pension funds to shun firms that move for tax purposes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Treasurer Phil Angelides called on California's two largest
pension funds Thursday to stop investing in companies that move their
headquarters offshore to avoid paying taxes, and said the state would
blacklist those firms.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, a growing number of U.S. companies, such as
conglomerate Tyco International Ltd., manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Co.
and Xoma Corp., a biotech firm, have reincorporated in Bermuda or the
Cayman Islands. Congress is considering legislation to curb corporate
expatriation, which costs the government millions in tax dollars each
year and can weaken shareholder rights.</LD>
<LD>   "Corporations hiding behind a mailbox in Bermuda are shirking
their duty as Americans," said Angelides, who released a list of 23
blacklisted firms, which includes Tyco, Ingersoll and Xoma, as well
as consulting firm Accenture Ltd., toolmaker Stanley Works and energy
company McDermott International Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Angelides proposed that the California Public Employees'
Retirement System, known as CalPERS, and the California State
Teachers' Retirement System eliminate their holdings in expatriate
companies. Angelides is a board member of both funds, which have a
combined $250 billion in assets. The treasurer's office estimated
that the two pension funds have a combined $752 million invested in
the blacklisted companies.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for CalPERS said they learned of Angelides' proposal
Wednesday night and did not have enough information to comment on it.
The earliest such a policy could be considered and adopted is Aug.
19, when the investment board meets, said Brad Pachecho, a CalPERS
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides controls a $45-billion investment fund of state and
local taxpayer funds, of which $10 billion is invested in the bonds
and commercial paper of companies on a state-approved list. Of the 23
targeted companies, only one--Ingersoll--was on the state list, and
Angelides ordered it removed.</TE>
<TE>   Although some observers speculated that other pension funds might
consider similar policies as Angelides', it's often difficult to put
such social policies into practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever someone does this, it sometimes sparks a wave," said Pat
O'Hara, a managing director at the Council for Institutional
Investors. "But just because it's politically appealing right now
doesn't mean it is smart financially."</TE>
<TE>   O'Hara said a pension fund would have to look carefully at the
ramifications of selling shares in a bear market.</TE>
<TE>   At Xoma, spokeswoman Ellen M. Martin said the company has been an
excellent corporate citizen in California and that its 175 employees,
most of whom are in the Bay Area, pay state and local taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The company moved its headquarters to Bermuda in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "The policy will have no material impact on us," Martin said.</TE>

<HD>AOL Stock Falls on Word of SEC Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shares of AOL Time Warner Inc. dived 15% into the single digits
Thursday on a flock of downgrades by Wall Street analysts after word
of an SEC investigation into accounting practices at the America
Online unit.</LD>
<LD>   Not only does the Securities and Exchange Commission probe create
new uncertainty, but several analysts said they have no confidence
that leaderless America Online can effectively deal with sputtering
subscriber growth and fast-shrinking advertising revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's plunge wiped out $8 billion in market value. The shares
fell $1.76 to a four-year low of $9.64 on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 149 million shares traded--six times the usual daily
volume. The stock is down 70% this year and 80% since the merger of
AOL and Time Warner in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst Frederick W. Moran, in a note to
investors, said strength in film, cable TV and publishing won't be
enough to offset America Online's problems in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons, in disclosing
the SEC "fact-finding inquiry" Wednesday, said the accounting
practices in question were reviewed and approved by the company's
auditors, Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   He said his top immediate priority is finding a new head for the
Internet unit to replace Robert W. Pittman, who resigned last week.</TE>

<HD>Burger King Sold to Buyout Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burger King Corp. has been sold by its parent company to a buyout
team for $2.26 billion in cash, a development that could help the
nation's No. 2 burger chain stabilize operations and boost market
share, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   British liquor company Diageo sold the chain to a consortium led
by Texas Pacific Group, a Fort Worth buyout outfit that holds a
majority stake in such companies as J. Crew Group Inc. and America
West Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   Texas Pacific is teaming with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and
Bain Capital to make the purchase. The consortium will not take on $1
billion in debt owed to Diageo.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the deal is good news for Burger King. Texas Pacific
is expected to pour money into such things as product development,
training and technology to turn around the chain, which has been
losing customers and market share for years amid instability in its
executive ranks, said Randall Hiatt of Fessel International, a Costa
Mesa restaurant consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike London-based Diageo, the new American owners will be
"engaged so we can touch, feel and communicate with them on a regular
basis," said Tony Versace, president of Multi King Corp., owner of 19
Burger King restaurants in Michigan and Illinois. Franchisees
complained about being ignored by Diageo.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Pacific plans to keep intact the current management team,
which has pointed the Miami-based, 11,435-unit chain in the right
direction, said Allan F. Hickok, an analyst with US Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Under the direction of former Northwest Airlines Chief Executive
John Dasburg, the company has rolled out scores of products,
including the highly successful Chicken Whopper, which have helped
boost same-store sales after years of declines.</TE>
<TE>   Burger King has room for improvement. The chain's market share
dropped to 18.5% last year, from 20.4% in 1998, according to
Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based restaurant research and consulting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   And in national food surveys, Burger King places behind
competitors Wendy's, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr., Villa Park
restaurant consultant Bob Sandelman said.</TE>

<HD>Health Net's Operating Profit Rises 22%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health Net Inc., one of the largest U.S. health insurers, said
second-quarter earnings rose 22% after the company shed plans that
weren't profitable.</LD>
<LD>   The Woodland Hills-based company said net income was $65 million,
or 51 cents a share, contrasted with a year-earlier loss of $14
million, or 12 cents. Excluding a charge for the sale of its Florida
health plan, profit was $53 million in the same quarter a year
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue rose slightly to $2.5 billion, after the company left
plans, including government-sponsored Medicaid and Medicare, and
added smaller plans in key markets such as California.</LD>
<TE>   Health Net shares were down $1.92 to $21.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings reported by California companies included:</TE>
<TE>   Autobytel Inc. said its second-quarter net loss narrowed
substantially to $600,000, or 2 cents a share, from a loss of $36.6
million, or $1.80, a year ago. Revenue at the Internet auto marketer
was up 32% to $20.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items, the
company earned $400,000, or 1 cent a share, contrasted with a loss of
$4.9 million, or 24 cents, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   First American Corp. said second-quarter net income fell 26% to
$40.1 million, or 51 cents a share, including an investment loss. The
Santa Ana-based provider of real estate information said revenue
increased 18% to $1.09 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Guitar Center Inc. reported flat second-quarter net income of $4.1
million, or 18 cents a share, including $1.45 million in costs
related to a new distribution center. The Westlake Village-based
seller of musical instruments said the results were better than it
expected, as sales rose 18% to $253.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Microsemi Corp., a maker of power management semiconductors, said
net income, including special charges, plunged 83% in its fiscal
third quarter to $740,000, or 3 cents a share, due to weakness in its
commercial airline, space, computers and mobile handset businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding charges, Microsemi earned $1.21 million, or 4 cents a
share, down 75% from a year ago. Revenue fell 14% to $51.5 million,
the Irvine-based company said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide Health Properties reported funds from operations of $22
million, or 45 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with
$24.7 million, or 53 cents, in 2001. Revenue for the real estate
investment trust, based in Newport Beach, fell 10% to $38 million.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler to Introduce 11 New Cars and Trucks</HD>
<DH>Autos: CEO says vehicles will be more competitive with
European and Japanese imports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>In an upbeat assessment of its future, the Chrysler Group of Daimler
Chrysler said Thursday that it will introduce 11 vehicles in the next
three model years and spend $30 billion on new product programs over
the next five years.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen months into an overhaul designed to return it to
profitability and increase the volume of cars and trucks it sells,
Chrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said the auto maker aims to
sell 1 million more vehicles by 2011.</LD>
<LD>   "We are clearly focused on lifting this company from a struggle
for survival to a position of excellence," Zetsche told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Chrysler will strive to make its passenger cars more competitive
with Japanese and European imports, which have gained significant
market share in the last 15 years while Detroit's Big Three have
faltered.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to win is to take the imports on and fight back,"
said Zetsche, sent out by DaimlerChrysler's Stuttgart headquarters in
November 2000 to turn around the ailing Chrysler.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler has identified product leadership, operational excellence
and customer experience as areas to hone. Zetsche cited Honda Motor
Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. as competitors to match in customer
experience, and Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. in operational prowess.
For product leadership, he said, many auto makers perform well, but
Volkswagen is as close as any of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be at benchmark levels on all three axes," Zetsche
said. "Where we really want to lead is product leadership, and match
the best in the other two categories. This is the 'disciplined
pizazz' we are talking about," referring to a motto thrown about
lately in the Chrysler headquarters here in this suburb north of
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Though Zetsche did not offer many specifics about the 11 new
models planned, he said among them are the already-announced Pacifica
part-sport utility, part-station wagon with three-row seating and the
sporty Crossfire coupe, both due to go on sale next year.</TE>
<TE>   The other new cars due in the next three years will be
replacements for current models such as a redesigned Dodge Viper and
a new line of large sedans to replace the Chrysler LHS and Concorde
and Dodge Intrepid, or derivatives of existing models such as the
heavy-duty Dodge Ram pickup.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like a lot of them are variations of existing themes,"
said Jim Hossack of the Tustin-based consultancy AutoPacific. "Only a
couple are likely to get incremental volume [gains]. I'm amazed at
the new product coming on [across the industry], and I see this as a
way for Chrysler to maintain their position, but insufficient to gain
market share particularly given the strong thrust of many of the
imports."</TE>
<TE>   The Chrysler Group--which consists of the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep
brands--launched a three-year plan in February 2001 consisting
largely of cutting 26,000 jobs, closing plants and eliminating other
costs. The company had an operating loss of $1.9 billion last year
but has posted an operating profit of $888 million in the first two
quarters of 2002 and says it expects to post a profit this year.
Chrysler does not make public its net earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Cost cutting is clearly benefiting the company," Morgan Stanley
auto analyst Steven Girsky wrote in an analysis of Detroit's auto
makers. "With profits recovering well ahead of Ford and less
significant balance sheet issues than GM, DaimlerChrysler may have
the least risk among the Big Three."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of DaimlerChrysler were down $2.40 to $41.10 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>FCC Rejects New Cell Phone Privacy Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators Thursday rejected an appeal to strengthen privacy
protections for consumers who use cell phones that track their
location.</LD>
<LD>   The move surprised both privacy advocates and the mobile phone
industry, which had formed an unusual alliance in asking the Federal
Communications Commission to clarify the privacy rights of wireless
users.</LD>
<LD>   But the FCC turned down the request, saying existing law provides
consumers with enough protection to control how and when information
about their location is gathered by and shared with companies. The
commission also said location-finding technologies are in their
infancy and should not yet be bound by new regulation.</LD>
<TE>   Critics say current law leaves many matters unresolved, such as
whether a company must get permission each time it uses a customer's
data and whether other wireless devices, such as hand-held computers
and the OnStar communication system built into some cars, would be
covered by the law.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen the tremendous pressure to sell personal information
on the Internet, where a customer's personal information may be a
company's most valuable asset," said Commissioner Michael J. Kopps,
the lone dissenter. "We should learn from the Internet privacy
situation and protect telephone customers from similar pressures."</TE>
<TE>   To improve emergency services, cell phone carriers are installing
technology that can more precisely locate phone users. The carriers
plan to capitalize on the technology by selling services that would
detect a user's location and provide directions to the closest ATM.</TE>
<TE>   Under existing law, with the exception of 911 calls, companies
must have the customer's approval before they use or share
information about his location.</TE>

<HD>Car Makers to Challenge State's New Emissions Law</HD>
<DH>Autos: Manufacturers say they are committed to vehicles
that emit fewer greenhouse gases--but at what they call a more
realistic pace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Auto makers say they plan to take California's new emissions law to
court and stop it in its tracks, much as the industry did in
derailing the state's attempt to mandate zero-emission vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The industry acknowledges that putting up a fight could create a
public opinion backlash, but the manufacturers say they remain
committed to introducing vehicles that emit fewer greenhouses gases
and pollutants and get better mileage--just at a more realistic pace.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very confident the court will recognize that California is
impinging on federal jurisdiction," said Eron Shosteck, spokesman for
the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the main industry trade
group. "The state cannot set its own fuel-economy standards."</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis on Monday signed the nation's first bill to fight
global warming by restricting emissions of carbon dioxide and other
so-called greenhouse gases. Although the bill does not spe- cifically
call for increased fuel economy, the auto industry sees it as a
thinly disguised attempt to legislate more miles per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   "By virtue of physics, it can't be anything else," Shosteck said.
"The only way to produce less carbon dioxide is to combust less fuel.
There's no device you can bolt onto a car that will do it."</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers have been incrementally reducing emissions and
boosting mileage with new engines such as those with variable valve
timing and displacement on demand, which shuts down cylinders when
not needed, and with hybrid vehicles that combine gasoline engines
and electric motors.</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives and outside experts agree that the ultimate
solution is fuel cells, which turn hydrogen into electricity while
producing water as a byproduct. But they also say the legislation's
requirement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2009 is asking too
much too soon of fuel cells, given the technology and its cost.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very optimistic of the future of fuel cells, but when you
look at 2009, there's not a chance," said David Cole, director of the
Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. "People need to
understand that the state of engine technology is based on a hundred
years of work. The easy and inexpensive cards have already been
played."</TE>
<TE>   Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of DaimlerChysler's Chrysler
Group, said he supports improved fuel economy but not when mandated
by the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's important to do car by car and truck by truck. We
don't think it's the best idea to force customers into a mix of cars
the customer wouldn't choose himself," Zetsche said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we are working to improve fuel economy ... but there
are physical issues. The weight and performance of the vehicle have
an impact, so if you want to reduce carbon dioxide, you can take
certain safety [features] and weight out, and the car has reduced
emissions significantly."</TE>
<TE>   Even Honda Motor Co., which Wednesday won the first state and
federal government certification to sell a fuel-cell car in the U.S.,
warned that the technology for mass production would be far from
ready in six or seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "Fuel cells are at least 10 years off, and easily 20 years," said
Art Garner, a spokesman for Torrance-based American Honda Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Honda, the only major manufacturer not in the alliance, has not
decided whether it will join the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Certification for the Honda FCX paves the way for the Japanese
auto maker to begin leasing the two-door, four-passenger fuel-cell
vehicle to government and institutions by the end of the year. It
gets the equivalent of 50 miles per gallon, making it one of the most
fuel-efficient cars available. The problem is it's not the type of
vehicle most people seek.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 50 different models that get 30 miles per gallon or
better, and very few people buy them," said Shosteck of the auto
alliance. "We make plenty of fuel- efficient cars. The problem is
that most Americans with work or family transportation needs want
something more versatile and powerful."</TE>
<TE>   That's part of the argument in support of the alliance's planned
lawsuit: The majority of Americans buy light trucks--pickups, sport
utility vehicles and minivans--and the new law would require smaller
vehicles that burn less fuel, limiting Californians' choices.</TE>
<TE>   The auto makers are likely to prevail in their lawsuit, said Chris
Struve of Fitch Ratings. It is consumers, he said, who are driving
the trend toward bigger, gas- guzzling trucks because they "can no
longer find a car that comfortably seats a family of four."</TE>
<TE>   The thrust of the industry's planned response is its claim that
California acted illegally in attempting to set fuel-economy
standards, a task that is the domain of the federal government.
California is the only state with power to set its own vehicle
pollution standards, but the industry maintains that carbon dioxide
does not fall under that authority.</TE>
<TE>   The law, hailed by environmental groups, requires an unspecified
reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by the 2009 model year.
The state Air Resources Board is to determine the extent of emission
reduction by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   But the Washington-based alliance, made up of 13 auto makers that
sell cars and trucks in the U.S., says it is optimistic about the
lawsuit because the industry's legal and lobbying efforts recently
have thwarted other initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, an attempt in Congress to increase average fuel
economy standards for cars and trucks was defeated. Last month, a
California court enjoined the state's mandate that would have
required a certain number of zero-emission vehicles by the 2003 model
year.</TE>
<TE>   Think tank director Cole points to one solution that few consider:
a new generation of cleaner diesel engines.</TE>
<TE>   "A Chevrolet Suburban with a diesel engine would get 30% better
fuel economy and produce 30% less carbon dioxide," he said. "But
California doesn't like diesels."</TE>

<LD>A jury ordered Walt Disney Co., Tim Allen and others tied to ABC's
hit show "Home Improvement" to pay nearly $15 million to a talent
agency.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles Superior Court jury said Disney owed $3.25 million
for underpaying commissions when the sitcom aired on ABC from 1991 to
1999. The rest of the award must be paid by several other "profit
participants" in the show, including Allen and actress Patricia
Richardson.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict sprang from a 1997 lawsuit by the Agency for the
Performing Arts, which sued on behalf of one of the show's creators,
Matt Williams, claiming he was cheated out of profits. Disney is
considering an appeal of the verdict.</LD>
<TE>   "We are disappointed by the verdict," said Disney spokeswoman
Michelle Bergman. "We believed that we satisfied our obligation" to
the talent agency.</TE>

breach-of-contract suit brought by the Agency of the Performing Arts.
Disney was the sole defendant in the case. However, Disney said it

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bucking the bleak media landscape, Viacom Inc. reported record
results for the second quarter, driven by an upswing in advertising
revenue at its CBS television network and cable businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Viacom reported earnings of $547 million, or 31 cents per share in
the second quarter ended June 30, compared with earnings of $17
million, or 1 cent per share, a year ago. The New York based company
reported revenue of $5.85 billion, up from $5.72 billion last year.</LD>
<LD>   The results beat Wall Street's estimate of 29 cents a share,
according to analysts polled by Thomson First Call. They reflect
Viacom's position as the most stable of the media giants. Its
operating results and stock price have outperformed rivals such as
Vivendi Universal, Walt Disney Co. and AOL Time Warner Inc. Viacom's
class B stock rose 60 cents to close at $35.05 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Viacom credited strong advertising sales at CBS and the company's
cable networks. Viacom also cited strong video sales at the company's
Blockbuster chain. The Paramount Pictures movie studio, however,
dragged down results with lower box-office sales.</TE>
<TE>   Touting the generally upbeat results, Viacom President Mel
Karmazin predicted that the company will see at least a 10% boost in
its cash flow this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts are skeptical. "I think the company will be
stretched to meet the double digit guidance," said Jordan Rohan, a
media analyst with Wit SoundView.</TE>

<KH>CRISIS IN CORPORATE AMERICA</KH>
<HD>Bill Offers Little to Defrauded Investors</HD>
<DH>Outlook: Lawmakers' proposal to repay shareholders with
fines collected from executives is filled with problems, many experts
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Congress' plan to reimburse defrauded shareholders with penalties
paid by corporate wrongdoers sounds good in theory but probably would
do little to help most investors, experts said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is part of the massive accounting and financial
reform bill passed by the House and Senate on Thursday and sent to
President Bush. It calls for all fines assessed against executives
and corporations by the Securities and Exchange Commission to go to a
victim restitution fund. That money now is sent to the Treasury
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers touted the plan as a way to compensate shareholders who
have lost huge sums in the flood of accounting scandals.</LD>
<TE>   But the relatively small amounts typically collected in such
cases, coupled with the logistical difficulty of disbursing funds to
potentially millions of people, means victims would receive little
money, many experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very hard for investors to prove they're
entitled to get some of this money," said Stephen Bainbridge, a UCLA
corporate and securities law professor. "It's going to be costly to
administer this program, and you're going to get pennies on the
dollar."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are anxious to show they are responding to the corporate
scandals and are helping victims, experts said. But it would be
better to earmark the money for the SEC to hire additional lawyers
and accountants to prevent future frauds, Bainbridge said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC collected $23.9 million in penalties last year, and has
taken in $44.9 million so far this year. But that is a fraction of
the billions of dollars in stock value lost by shareholders of
WorldCom Inc., Enron Corp. and others.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC already compensates some victims out of a separate program
requiring executives to disgorge ill-gotten gains. Such gains include
salary, bonuses and stock option proceeds that managers received
during the period their fraud occurred.</TE>
<TE>   But the disgorgement program illustrates the difficulty the SEC
faces in collecting money and dispensing it to victims.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC won court orders last year requiring executives and
companies to disgorge $530 million, but the agency collected just
$27.5 million, or 5% of the total ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $632 million in court-ordered disgorgements this year, the
SEC so far has taken in $73 million, or 12% of the total.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have received even less than the amounts recovered
because the SEC, working with the courts, reimburses investors only
in cases in which it is financially feasible to do so, said Brian
Gross, an SEC spokesman in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The relatively small amounts recovered reflect that some
executives go broke because of their free-spending ways and because
of attorney costs and have no money left to disgorge. "A lot of funds
are simply gone by the time you get to them," Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   When the SEC determines it is uneconomical to pay victims, any
disgorgement money is funneled to the Treasury, Gross said. The
agency has no figures on how much disgorgement money has found its
way into investors' hands over the years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, defrauded investors probably would welcome any dollars they
could get through the SEC. Their alternative--private shareholder
lawsuits--typically provide low recovery rates as well.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, class-action lawsuits that shareholders bring against
companies often generate big headlines, but investors usually receive
only a fraction of what they lost, data show.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1990, the average securities class-action lawsuit has been
settled for 12 cents of every dollar in claimed losses, according to
National Economic Research Associates Inc., a White Plains, N.Y.,
consulting firm. And that excludes attorneys' fees, which can lop 30%
or more off a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who are eligible for restitution from the SEC usually
are notified by the agency. They also can fill out claims forms
placed in ads in financial newspapers and other publications, Gross
said.</TE>
<TE>   But figuring out who is owed money, and getting it to them, is a
time-consuming and expensive process for the SEC, and would only get
worse under the corporate reform bill, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The administrative mess in trying to figure out who is a
deserving shareholder in a single securities suit is typically a
monumental headache," said Michael Young, a civil defense attorney at
Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher in New York. "How are they possibly going to
calculate deserving shareholders in all the securities fraud actions
over the course of the year?"</TE>

<HD>Southwest Slashes Fall Fares in Showdown With JetBlue</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Price cuts for California routes are in response
to upstart carrier's expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fare battle erupted for post-Labor Day travel in the West as
Southwest Airlines Co. joined new entrant JetBlue Airways Corp. and
slashed prices Thursday to as low as $19 each way.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts were not unexpected after JetBlue, a young airline based
in New York, recently announced plans to launch service between Long
Beach--its West Coast hub--and Oakland on Sept. 6 with nine daily
flights. JetBlue also plans to start six daily Long Beach-Las Vegas
flights Oct. 10.</LD>
<LD>   A day after JetBlue put the new flights on sale with cheap fares,
low-fare king Southwest responded with a sale throughout California,
where it is the dominant carrier. Southwest has nearly 100 daily
flights between airports in the Los Angeles Basin and the San
Francisco Bay Area and 38 daily flights between the Southland and Las
Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Southwest's sale, which covers flights starting Sept. 3, is in
effect until Jan. 10. JetBlue's sale prices are set to end Aug. 15
for travel until Nov. 5. Both carriers are offering one-way fares as
low as $19 from Southern California to Las Vegas and intra-California
fares of $29 to $39 each way, excluding fees and taxes. The fares
carry various restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines often cut leisure fares in September because it is a slow
time for travel. But this price war will be a test of JetBlue, which
with Southwest is one of the few profitable airlines. Other carriers
still are reeling from the post-Sept. 11 slump in air travel, and the
whole industry lost $1.4 billion in the quarter ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Like Southwest, JetBlue makes money because it has high passenger
demand and low operating costs, and it already has held its own
against rivals in crowded markets such as Florida. JetBlue said
Thursday that its second-quarter profit jumped 37% from a year
earlier, to $14.6 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, from $10.7
million, or 33 cents. The per-share figure didn't change because
JetBlue, which had its initial public stock offering in April, now
has more shares outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Although Southwest has more frequent service, a bigger marketing
budget and a loyal following among travelers, "we're very confident
that we'll get a share of that business and be successful," JetBlue
Chief Executive David Neeleman told analysts Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's profit, too, might come under pressure with fares this
low, but airline spokeswoman Whitney Brewer said the carrier's low
cost structure, combined with its frequent flights, would be able to
handle the lower prices. She acknowledged that Southwest launched the
sale in part because "we have had some new entrants into the market."</TE>
<TE>   James Parker, an analyst with investment firm Raymond James &amp;
Associates, said he was optimistic about the prospects for Southwest
and JetBlue despite the fare sale.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue, with its leather seats, assigned seating and in-flight
television, has "a product that's perceived to be better" than
Southwest's by many travelers, Parker said. But "Southwest is
certainly not going to give up any ground."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest casualties of the fare sale could be larger airlines
such as United, which can ill afford cheaper fares or a loss of
market share to lower-price rivals, analysts said. The UAL Corp. unit
is Southwest's main competitor in California, but United has much
higher costs, is suffering huge losses and is seeking a federal
bailout in the form of a loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   United did not match the lower fares in California and had no
other comment, said United spokesman Chris Brathwaite.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's stock tumbled again Thursday, losing 53 cents, or 11%, to
$4.17 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue's stock sale has been one of the few IPO hits this year,
with the stock surging well above its IPO price of $27 a share. But
after Southwest's announcement Thursday, JetBlue shares fell $1.20,
or 2.9%, to $40.85 on Nasdaq. Southwest rose 25 cents to $12.06 a
share on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Bill for Anti-Piracy Shield Proposed</HD>
<DH>Internet: Measure would provide some protection against
lawsuits for firms trying to protect their copyright material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music, movie and game companies that launch technological attacks
against pirates using file-sharing networks would have broad
protection against lawsuits under a bill introduced Thursday by Rep.
Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills).</LD>
<LD>   Berman's proposal drew praise from major record labels and
Hollywood studios, as well as cautious support from a group of
high-tech companies. But other technology groups remained on the
fence, and two leading file-sharing networks denounced the bill as
damaging to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The bill isn't likely to become law this year, given how little
time remains before Congress adjourns for its August recess. But
Berman hopes the proposal will at least get a hearing in the House
Judiciary subcommittee on courts, the Internet and intellectual
property, which is led by one of the bill's co-sponsors, Rep. Howard
Coble (R-N.C.).</LD>
<TE>   In contrast to other anti-piracy proposals introduced this year,
the Berman bill wouldn't force electronic devices to use a specific
technology. Instead, copyright owners would be free to use any
technology to disable, block or impair their works from being pirated
on a file-sharing network, provided that they didn't damage users'
computers or block other files from being traded.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, attorney Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier
Federation said, "That sort of vigilante justice often can have
unintended collateral consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union asked a federal
judge in Massachusetts to rule that the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act doesn't bar a researcher from picking electronic locks on
software to gain information critical to his inquiries. The
researcher, Benjamin Edelman, is studying a controversial
Internet-filtering program used by many schools and libraries.</TE>

<HD>Forthcoming CDs Pirated on Web</HD>
<DH>Internet: Slick sites based overseas are offering
Springsteen and Linkin Park albums free. Their location complicates
copyright enforcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the music industry's intensifying battle against online
piracy, a new crop of Web sites are brazenly offering entire pirated
CDs for free downloading even before they are released.</LD>
<LD>   In recent days, two of these sites--Listen4ever and 21st Century
MP3--have offered complete versions of forthcoming albums by such top
acts as Bruce Springsteen, Linkin Park, Def Leppard and R. Kelly. The
sites support themselves by selling pop-up and banner advertisements
for a wide variety of companies, ranging from online casinos to Dell
computers.</LD>
<LD>   Their operations are based at least in part overseas, complicating
the task of enforcing copyrights. For example, records show that
Listen4ever's Web site was registered by Australian and Chinese
companies, with support for the site coming from an Internet service
provider in Beijing.</LD>
<TE>   Such operations are cropping up even as the music and movie
industries battle to curtail online piracy on a growing number of
fronts, including the courts, Congress and international copyright
authorities. Their emergence illustrates how attractive online music
piracy remains to entrepreneurs around the world and how difficult it
can be for companies to stop their works from being copied for free.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet offers a cornucopia of free music, virtually all of
it made available without the copyright owners' permission. The
sources range from peer-to-peer services that let users find and
retrieve songs from one another's computers to more obscure,
harder-to-use chat groups that let users copy music from virtual
warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   The new crop is distinguished by slick presentations and easy
operation. Users click on album covers to call up a list of songs
from that CD, then click on song names to download them. The songs
are presented in common Internet file formats, although in some cases
users have to download and install extra software to gain access to
the music.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds wildly blatant, and I'm surprised the lawsuit hasn't
been filed yet," said analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology
research firm. "The [recording industry] is taking these sites on one
at a time, and it's just a matter of time before the bull's-eye gets
painted on them."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Recording Industry Assn. of America, a trade
group for the record companies, said the RIAA has been able to shut
down similar U.S.-based Web sites just by notifying the site or its
Internet service provider of the apparent copyright violation. For
those based overseas, it typically has relied on similar enforcement
actions by its international counterpart, the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry.</TE>
<TE>   No action has yet been taken on Listen4ever or related sites, the
RIAA said.</TE>
<TE>   By the international federation's count, there are about 200,000
Internet sites providing free access to an estimated 100 million
pirated music files. Last year, the federation and its affiliates
worldwide helped shut down 28,000 sites with 5.6 million pirated
files and pulled the plug on close to 1,000 computers providing
directories to illicit peer-to-peer services.</TE>
<TE>   Because they rely on ad revenue, the new sites need to draw large
audiences to generate profit. But rather than promoting themselves
overtly, they keep a low profile and rely on word of mouth to lure
users before the record companies can shut them down.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is, you want to drive traffic to your site, but the bad
news is you don't want to attract too much attention," McNealy said.
"At the end of the day, their business model is based on the
intellectual property of others. It's just a matter of time until
they're toast."</TE>
<TE>   Operators of Listen4ever and 21st Century MP3 could not be
reached. Their owners were not identified on their sites.</TE>

<DH>Ethics: A provision in the reform bill would require
company lawyers to report fraud. It could encourage investors to sue
them.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The corporate reform bill approved by Congress would require company
lawyers to report evidence of wrongdoing to boards of directors, a
big defeat for the American Bar Assn. and one that could open lawyers
to something with which they are all too familiar: lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers also are alarmed by broad language in the bill that they
believe could be used to turn them into corporate snitches.</LD>
<LD>   "This very much talks about making lawyers responsible for client
conduct in a way that interferes very much with the lawyer-client
relationship," said Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence J. Fox, a leading
proponent of attorney-client privilege. "It turns lawyers into junior
regulators, surveillance operatives, whistle-blowers."</LD>
<TE>   The provision was added to the reform bill out of the belief that
company lawyers are often aware early on of corporate conduct that
could harm shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts on both sides of the bill said it represents an
unprecedented incursion by a legislative body into the governance of
the profession, which has historically been the domain of the high
courts in each state.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Gillers, vice dean of the New York University law school
and a legal ethics expert, said it makes sense to create national
standards for lawyers who work with large, publicly traded firms. But
he said the bill could be the beginning of a move toward national
uniformity of rules on other types of legal work.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's a first, but it's a significant effort by
Congress to assume some responsibility for the regulation of lawyers,
who are traditionally licensed at the state level," he said. "I worry
about how wide that door will swing."</TE>
<TE>   The bill also was seen as an erosion of the ABA's influence on
states' codes of conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "The ABA is worried it will no longer be the 900-pound gorilla,
the only player on the block," Gillers said. "But that's a good
thing. It's important to have many voices heard on these issues."</TE>
<TE>   ABA President Robert E. Hirshon said the organization supports
much of the bill and shares a desire to restore investor confidence.
However, he said, some provisions open "a Pandora's box."</TE>
<TE>   The idea that lawyers should report corporate wrongdoing to board
members was introduced as a proposal to the ABA in 1998 by University
of Illinois law professor Richard Painter. The ABA, which adopts
model rules as examples for states to follow, rebuffed Painter.</TE>
<TE>   After the Enron Corp. meltdown, Painter drafted a letter to the
Securities and Exchange Commission recommending that the agency
impose the rule on securities lawyers. This time Painter had the
signatures of 40 law professors representing the most prestigious
schools in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would have required lawyers who work in and for
corporations to report knowledge of securities law violations to
management. If executives failed to take appropriate action, lawyers
would have had to go over their heads to the board. The ABA objected,
and the SEC declined to take action, deferring to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Then Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), a trial lawyer, took up the
cause, winning approval for a version stricter than the one Painter
presented to the SEC. Under the provision in the reform bill headed
to President Bush, lawyers would be forced to report evidence--a
lower legal threshold than "knowledge"--not only of securities
violations but also of breaches of fiduciary duties, such as loyalty
and care to the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the provision does not contemplate private litigation, it
increases the prospects that aggrieved shareholders will sue a
corporation's lawyers for damages on theory that they were aware of a
problem but failed to act as required by the SEC, lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "The great irony in this is the ABA has been very opposed to any
attempt to scale back liability of anybody else but lawyers," Painter
said. "They've been very aggressive on any attempt to cut back on
punitive damages, to scale back on tort litigation. But when it comes
to anything where somebody might be suing lawyers, it's a whole
different picture."</TE>
<TE>   ABA President Hirshon said the bill is flawed and may go beyond
what Congress intended. "There may be a technical corrections bill
that may be used to address some of the unintended consequences of
the act," he said. "My bet and my fear is we're going to find them."</TE>
<TE>   The introductory language to the Edwards' provision, for instance,
commands the SEC to "issue rules, in the public interest and for the
protection of investors, setting forth minimum standards of
professional conduct for attorneys." That, Hirshon said, could allow
the SEC to require lawyers to disclose information that is now
protected by attorney-client privilege rules of the states.</TE>
<TE>   Another provision that would create an accounting oversight board
could allow the new agency to impose similar ethical rules on
lawyers. The section intended to prevent accounting firms from
auditing and consulting for the same company could prevent law firms
from working for both an accounting firm and its auditing clients.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing has been done really rushed and really harried,"
Hirshon said. "I understand the need to restore confidence. But there
is a reason why when you start redrafting ethical rules, you need to
go slowly. You've got to think it through and hear what the
ramifications are."</TE>
<TE>   The ABA is in a better position to consider rules for lawyers, he
said. A special task force appointed by Hirshon released its
recommendations this week for changes in corporate governance,
including a re-examination of its model rule that permits, but does
not require, lawyers to inform boards of corporate wrongdoing.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Fails to Build on Big Rally</HD>
<DH>Markets: Stocks close mixed after another volatile trading
session. Technology sector is hit hard amid weakening of demand for
chips.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street on Thursday was unable to sustain Wednesday's momentum as
stocks finished mixed--raising new fears that the 28-month-old bear
market hasn't yet run its course.</LD>
<LD>   Investors endured another wild session, which has become the norm
this summer. The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared 488
points Wednesday, rallied at the outset Thursday but then fell as
much 246 points before recovering most of that loss to finish down
4.98 points, or 0.1%, at 8,186.31.</LD>
<LD>   Technology stocks had a rougher time after a report indicated that
semiconductor demand is weakening. The Nasdaq composite rebounded
from its lows of the day but still ended with a loss of 50.15 points,
or 3.9%, at 1,240.08, not far above the five-year closing low of
1,229 on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "There are some signs that stocks are in the bottoming phase, such
as all the investor pessimism that's out there," said Robert
Armknecht, manager of Galaxy Equity Growth fund in Boston. "But this
market might be like a patient who had a bad fever: The fever finally
broke Wednesday, but the patient may have to recuperate for quite a
while."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, markets rarely bottom in July or August, Armknecht
said. "Buyers just don't seem to be around during the summer."</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 4.75 points, or 0.6%, to
838.68, though it also closed well above its lows of the session.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts expressed disappointment that the market couldn't
gain traction and build on Wednesday's sharp rebound, which was
fueled in part by Congress' agreement on a corporate reform bill and
by the arrest of executives at the heart of the Adelphia
Communications accounting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow's 6.4% surge Wednesday was its biggest one-day gain since
1987.</TE>
<TE>   Market breadth was positive Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange--nearly four stocks rose for every three that fell, and
volume remained heavy. But many experts were hoping for a much more
lopsided ratio of winners to losers to show that investors were again
hungry to buy stocks, after nine weeks of sustained selling.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq losers had a 19-to-15 edge. Tech names were weighed down
after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest
producer of chips for other companies, said it will cut capital
spending because of weakening demand.</TE>
<TE>   The report drove the SOX chip-stock index down 10% to a new
multi-year low. Many other tech stocks fell to their lowest levels
since at least Jan. 1: Microsoft slid $3.40 to $42.83, Cisco Systems
sagged $1.48 to $11.61 and Intel lost $1.22 to $17.48. Analysts at
Sanford Bernstein and CS First Boston issued cautious reports on
Cisco, adding to the tech malaise.</TE>
<TE>   A government report showing that demand for big-ticket goods
declined sharply in July also served as a reminder that the U.S.
economic picture remains murky.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts said Thursday's mid-session snap-back in
blue-chip stocks could be seen as encouraging, considering the
economic data, new bankruptcy rumors that rocked Tyco International
and the steep drop in shares of AOL Time Warner, whose accounting is
being investigated by regulators. Tyco fell $1.75 to $8.25 and AOL
lost $1.76 to $9.64.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Thursday, the dollar weakened again, and Treasury
yields resumed their decline. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
T-note eased to 4.38% from 4.47% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Among chip-equipment makers, Applied Materials shed $2.32 to
$14.23, Micron Technology lost $2.55 to $19.20 and KLA-Tencor fell
$3.88 to $38.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Good news lifted some drug and biotech stocks. Abbott
Laboratories gained $4.17 to $37.62 after winning regulatory approval
to keep selling a thyroid drug. Amgen rose $4.85 to $41.94 after
topping quarterly profit forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   * Educational-toy maker Leapfrog Enterprises, backed by Michael
Milken and Oracle chief Larry Ellison, went public at $13 a share and
surged to close at $15.85.</TE>

<DL>REDMOND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. said Thursday it will focus on winning more
small-business customers and less on releasing blockbuster consumer
products such as its Windows XP operating system, significantly
boosting its research and development and hiring 5,000 workers.</LD>
<LD>   With sales of personal computers slipping, the world's biggest
software company has more to gain by selling higher-end software to
companies, executives said. With large firms reluctant to spend more
on Microsoft, the company has more potential in small and medium-size
firms, Chairman Bill Gates said. "The amount of price opportunity in
large accounts is modest," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Gates also said the company will add 10% to its staff this year,
and will increase research and development spending by 20% to $5.2
billion. "It's an aggressive approach, but one that I certainly
believe in," he said.</LD>
<TE>   In a later interview with reporters and analysts, Gates said the
company's taste for acquisitions and outside investments has changed
substantially in the wake of Microsoft's losses in telecommunications
and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's shares fell $3.40, or 7%, to $42.83 Thursday on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.</TE>
<TE>   After the markets closed, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John
Connors said the company did well by reporting a 7% increase in
operating income in the last year while rivals reported declines.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged, however, that Microsoft will not be as profitable
as in the past due to sales increases from lower-margin, non-PC
products. "We will see our gross profit margin tick down over time,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Connors said Microsoft's operating income should increase 6% to 8%
as revenue increases 11% to 13% this fiscal year, assuming the
economy doesn't worsen and PC shipments increase slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is making gains on products for business but is still
assembling a set of server software for various functions, including
customer management and database applications.</TE>
<TE>   Executives said they had high hopes for the Tablet PC, a one-piece
machine with a detachable keyboard and handwriting recognition that
is due in November.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were reserved about the Tablet. "I don't think it's going
to do well," said UBS Warburg analyst Don Young. "The PC industry is
dying for a reason to go get a new product." Young owns no Microsoft
shares and has a "strong buy" recommendation on the stock. UBS does
investment banking business with Microsoft.</TE>

<HD>Pearle Reacts to California Suit</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to a lawsuit filed by California in February, Pearle
Vision Inc. and Pearle VisionCare Inc. opened a cross-complaint in
San Diego Superior Court on Thursday against state Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer and the director of the Department of Consumer Affairs.</LD>
<LD>   The state lawsuit alleged that Pearle Vision, a subsidiary of
Cleveland-based Cole National Corp., has engaged in the deceptive
marketing of eye exams and in the unlicensed practice of optometry.
At issue is whether Pearle Vision's practice of having in-house eye
care performed by Pearle VisionCare Inc. for one-stop shopping
purposes is a violation of state consumer protection laws.</LD>
<LD>   "The laws as they were passed were intended to protect consumers
so that people doing the exams would focus on proving quality eye
care without having a financial interest to have eyeglasses sold,
too," said Sandy Michioku, a spokesman for the attorney general's
office.</LD>
<TE>   Pearle Vision's lawyers contend the state lawsuit is
unconstitutional and a misuse of consumer protection laws that
threatens the way Pearle and other similar chain stores do business
in California.</TE>

<HD>Sales of Existing Homes Decline</HD>
<DH>Real estate: June total is down 12% from May. But mortgage
rates fall this week to 35-year low.</DH>

<LD>Sales of existing homes fell sharply in June, recording the biggest
monthly decline in seven years. But mortgage rates dropped Thursday
to their lowest level in 35 years, which could help bolster housing
activity.</LD>
<LD>   The existing-home sales decline of 12% was larger than expected,
but the month's annualized sales pace of 5.07 million units still
indicates a robust market, according to a report released Thursday by
the National Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   The group said it expects activity to bounce back this summer, and
predicts total sales this year will set a record.</LD>
<TE>   In another housing report Thursday, the government said sales of
new homes rose to a record pace in June, spurred by inexpensive
mortgages and buyers looking for a more secure investment than
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of new single-family homes rose less than 1% to a yearly
rate of more than 1 million, up from a revised 996,000 pace in May,
the Commerce Department said. Led by a solid increase in the West
last month, sales this year remain on track to establish a new
record, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Housing is undeniably strong and will remain strong," said Carl
Steen, an analyst at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. in New York.
"Interest rates are still low and enough people are employed" to keep
the housing market robust.</TE>
<TE>   New-home prices are nearly 2% higher than they were a year
earlier, while the Dow Jones industrial average has declined 20%
during the same period. Order backlogs have swelled at D.R. Horton
Inc. and other major builders, suggesting that housing will keep
propelling economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, mortgage giant Freddie Mac on Thursday  said rates for
the average 30-year fixed loan dropped to 6.34%, the lowest figure on
record since the company began tracking rates weekly in 1971. Chief
Economist Robert Van Order said rates were last at this level in May
1967.</TE>
<TE>   The reduction may cause more homeowners to consider refinancing
their loans. The Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America estimated that
one-third of U.S. homeowners could be candidates for lower-rate
mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage rates tend to track government bond yields, which have
tumbled this year as more investors have fled stocks for bonds.</TE>

<TE>   Durable goods orders posted their largest drop in seven months in
June, the government said in a report that raised questions about the
strength of the economic recovery, particularly in manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   Orders fell 3.8% in June, the Commerce Department said. It was the
largest drop since a 5.9% fall in November and was far worse than the
0.7% rise analysts had expected. It contrasted with a 0.6% climb in
May.</TE>
<TE>   Orders were down in almost all sectors. Machinery tumbled 6.7%,
the biggest fall since an 8.1% decline in February 2000.
Manufacturing orders, including unfilled orders, dropped 4.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing
new claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 21,000 to 362,000

<TE>   Hershey Foods Co. said the charitable foundation holding a
controlling stake in the largest U.S. candy and chocolate maker is
exploring a sale of the company.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to put the company on the block comes after the
Milton Hershey School Trust, which owns about a third of Hershey's

proposed alternatives to a sale, Hershey said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Richard Lenny said the Hershey board would have
preferred to keep the company independent, but will cooperate with
the trust in the effort to find a buyer. The company has hired
investment bankers UBS Warburg and the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell
to advise it.</TE>

<TE>   Scour Says It Intends</TE>
<TE>   to Repay All Creditors</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual move amid the flood of companies filing for
bankruptcy, Scour Inc.--the defunct entertainment dot-com operation
once backed by former super-agent Michael Ovitz and supermarket
magnate Ronald Burkle--is expected to pay back all of its creditors
and investors by July 31.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills company, which filed for bankruptcy protection
in October 2000, was created by a group of UCLA students who
developed a search engine that hunted for multimedia files, such as
music, video and pictures. The product raised the ire of the
entertainment industry, which claimed the company was encouraging the
pirating of intellectual property.</TE>
<TE>   Scour's assets eventually were sold to CenterSpan Communications
Corp., a software developer based in Hillsboro, Ore., and bankruptcy
attorneys have divvied up the $7-million estate to pay back "every
penny on the dollar to hundreds of creditors," said debtor attorney
Paul Brent. "There was about $5 million in creditor debt. Whatever's
left will go to the shareholders. For the shareholders to actually
get any money back is rare."</TE>
<TE>   The final division will happen at the end of this month, when the
case is expected to close at Bankruptcy Court in L.A.</TE>

<TE>   Shares of Genuity Inc. lost nearly 89% of their value and the
company was thrown into debt default as Verizon Communications Inc.
ruled out a rescue of the money-losing communications services
company.</TE>
<TE>   Genuity shares closed at 29 cents, down $2.30, on Nasdaq. The
shares of Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. local telephone company and
Genuity's former corporate parent, lost 25 cents to $27.60 on the
NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   "We think Verizon's move throws Genuity into the abyss and may be
a death sentence," said Kaufman Bros. analyst Vik Grover. He
downgraded Genuity shares to "sell" from "hold."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon said it had decided not to reabsorb Genuity and would not
be obligated to make additional loans to the company. Verizon was
forced to spin off Genuity as a condition of the merger of Bell
Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp. that created Verizon in 2000.</TE>

<LD>The Senate, acting with unusual speed in the face of a crisis in
investor confidence, confirmed four nominees to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The move fills the commission for the first time
in more than two years.</LD>
<LD>   The confirmations, following closely the passage of landmark
corporate reform legislation, was expected to give the nation's top
markets regulator a needed boost and sufficient manpower to put into
action a host of new rules.</LD>
<LD>   Senate action came on a voice vote without any objection, just
hours after the Senate Banking Committee approved the nominees.</LD>
<TE>   The new commissioners are Democrats Roel Campos and Harvey
Goldschmid and Republicans Cynthia Glassman and Paul Atkins. Glassman
had been serving as a temporary commissioner, and Campos will replace
a temporary appointee.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hershey Foods Co. said the charitable foundation holding a
controlling stake in the largest U.S. candy and chocolate maker is
exploring a sale of the company.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to put the company on the block comes after the
Milton Hershey School Trust, which owns about a third of Hershey's
stock but controls 77% of the voting power, rejected management's
proposed alternatives to a sale, Hershey said.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Richard Lenny said the Hershey board would have
preferred to keep the company independent, but will cooperate with
the trust in the effort to find a buyer. The company has hired
investment bankers UBS Warburg and the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell
to advise it.</LD>

Exchange.</TE>

<LD>American International Group Inc.'s net income rose in the second
quarter as the world's biggest insurer increased prices on auto and
business policies and sold more life insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding investment gains and losses and accounting changes,
American International earned $2.21 billion, or 84 cents a share, up
from $2.02 billion, or 76 cents, a year ago. The per-share figure was
a penny less than the average forecast of analysts.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg said earnings were hurt
by low interest rates, which pared investment income, and by losses
on WorldCom Inc. and the slump in equity markets, which reduced
variable annuity sales and fees for managing assets.</LD>

<HD>Shea to Help Develop Site in Pasadena</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Worldwide Church of God has hired Shea Homes, one of Southern
California's largest home builders, to help guide development of the
church's historic Ambassador College site in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The church selected Shea Homes to act as its chief development
consultant nearly three months after Foster City-based Legacy
Partners abandoned plans to buy the 48-acre campus in west Pasadena
and build a large-scale residential project. The Legacy proposal to
build 1,700 housing units attracted growing interest among residents
concerned about density and traffic congestion.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Legacy, Shea Homes will not purchase the property but will
work for the church and be responsible for hiring architects and
creating a master plan, as well as seeking necessary government
entitlements and approvals, said Bernard W. Schnippert, director of
finance and planning for the church.</LD>
<TE>   Retaining ownership of the property "allows us to interface with
the neighbors and the city more directly without someone between us,"
Schnippert said.</TE>
<TE>   Schnippert said the church has not decided how many homes it will
seek to build but the project will remain primarily residential, with
historic buildings and the Ambassador Auditorium incorporated into a
"garden residential community" on the west side of the freeway near
Orange Grove Avenue. The church's property on the other side of the
freeway will be more urban in character, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The church closed the Pasadena campus in 1995 as revenue and
church membership fell.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Homes is based in Walnut, but Joe Shea, a principal and
member of the company's founding family, is a Pasadena resident.</TE>

<HD>Xerox Swings to 2nd-Quarter Profit</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. earned $93 million in the second quarter, its first
profit in more than a year, and said it would be profitable for the
year. Sales in the recent quarter dropped to $3.95 billion from $4.28
billion a year earlier. Net income was 12 cents a share, contrasted
with a net loss of $101 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Profit in the second half is expected to be 9 cents to 12 cents,
Chief Executive Anne Mulcahy said. Analysts had expected a loss.</LD>
<LD>   Mulcahy has sold assets and exited businesses, such as
small-office printers, as sales dropped for the ninth quarter in a
row. Xerox also cut its work force by 2,200 positions to 72,400.
Mulcahy said there would be more job cuts.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox rose 85 cents to $6.20 on
the New York Stock Exchange. It has fallen 18% in the last year amid
a Securities and Exchange Commission probe that led to a record
$10-million fine for inflating sales.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * VeriSign Inc., the nation's leading Internet name registrar,
reported a second-quarter net loss caused mostly by a $4.6-billion
noncash charge related to the write-down of acquisitions. The
Mountain View, Calif.-based company reported a net loss of $4.8
billion, or $20.31 a share. The loss was still a boost over the same
period last year, when VeriSign reported a net loss of $11.19
billion, or $55.49 a share, including a $9.9-billion
acquisition-related charge. Sales for the quarter rose to $317.4
million from $231.1 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Executives said that, despite struggling under the general
economic slump, VeriSign saw some growth for telecommunications
services and Web authentication products. Its stock dropped 62 cents
to $5.25 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   * Electronic Arts Inc., the nation's largest independent video
game publisher, surprised Wall Street, posting a net profit of $7.4
million, or 5 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, contrasted
with a year-earlier loss of $45.3 million, or 33 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets,
Redwood City, Calif.-based EA posted operating profit of $9 million,
or 6 cents a share. Analysts had estimated a loss of 8 cents. Revenue

<HD>Tyco Taps Motorola President as CEO</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HARRY R. WEBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. appointed Motorola Inc. President Edward D.
Breen its new chairman and chief executive Thursday as the
conglomerate struggles to right itself amid questions about its
accounting and investigations involving several top officers.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, made after markets closed, came the same day
that Tyco's shares plunged amid rumors it would seek bankruptcy
protection. The company denied those rumors.</LD>
<LD>   The stock slid $1.75, or 18%, to $8.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange, then surged to $10.05 in after-hours trading on the Breen
news.</LD>
<TE>   Breen replaces L. Dennis Kozlowski, who resigned June 3, a day
before being indicted in New York on sales-tax-evasion charges in
connection with the purchase of works of art.</TE>
<TE>   "The appointment of Ed Breen as chairman and CEO is a defining
moment for Tyco," said John Fort, lead director and interim chief
executive. "Ed has a superb record of tackling very difficult and
complex business challenges, creating effective strategies and
methodically executing on his plans."</TE>
<TE>   Financial transactions involving Fort, who headed Tyco from 1982
to 1992, and other top Tyco executives are being reviewed by Tyco,
including the 1996 sale of a New Hampshire home by Fort to Kozlowski.</TE>
<TE>   Breen, the former chairman and CEO of General Instrument Corp.,
joined Illinois-based Motorola in January 2000, when the two
companies merged. He was named Motorola's president and chief
operating officer in October 2001. He was credited with instituting
cost cutting and other programs to make Motorola more efficient and
has led the company back to profitability.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola said Mike Zafirovski, executive vice president and
president of its personal communications sector, will replace Breen.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola shares, off $1.28 to $12.18 on the NYSE in regular
trading, fell to $10.75 after hours.</TE>

<LD>On the heels of one high-profile criminal case against corporate

against former officers of WorldCom Inc. for their roles in an
accounting scheme that overstated revenue by $3.9 billion.</LD>

Myers are expected to be named in indictments accusing them of
defrauding investors in the nation's No. 2 long-distance company and
triggering the nation's biggest bankruptcy, said unnamed sources
cited in several news service reports and the Wall Street Journal.</LD>
<TE>   "We are confident that the prosecutors will ignore the howling mob
and concentrate on the evidence, and if they do so, Mr. Ebbers will
not be prosecuted," said his attorney, Reid Weingarten.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Sullivan and Myers could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, authorities arrested cable pioneer John Rigas and
two of his sons. The three were accused of looting Adelphia
Communications Corp. and using the cable company as their "personal
piggy bank." Two other former executives also were charged.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is going to indict lots of corporate executives
who abused their positions, and the markets better get used to it,"
said telecommunications analyst Scott Cleland of research firm
Precursor Group in Washington. "There's nothing like having examples
to increase deterrence."</TE>
<TE>   With pressure mounting from Congress and the White House,
prosecutors are moving with unprecedented speed to bring a case
against former WorldCom executives, said Washington lawyer Jacob
Frenkel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be tragic if the intense pressure ... results in a race
to see which prosecutor's office can bring most quickly the biggest
and baddest case," Frenkel said. "Just because politicians are
demanding a shoot-first, ask-questions later approach does not mean
that's what the alleged conduct warrants."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, though, prosecutors may have ample evidence, the
ability to analyze it quickly and willing insiders ready to testify,
making a case easier to put together, said Richard Marmaro, a Los
Angeles white-collar defense lawyer and former assistant U.S.
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting scheme has been described as a simple transfer of
expenses to the capital investment line, thus boosting revenue and
allowing the firm to post profit for 15 months through March when it
should have reported losses.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom could face criminal charges, according to reports. But
legal and industry experts said that path may be unwise, partly
because the company serves so many government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Frankel said, "criminal indictment, with the accompanying
stigma and potential for exclusion from government contracts, would
be near-fatal for WorldCom."</TE>

<HD>Patterson Has Sense of Belonging</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Right-hander earns his first major league win in
10-0 rout of Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>John Patterson knows his first trip to the big leagues probably won't
last long. He just wanted to show he belonged.</LD>
<LD>   Mission accomplished.</LD>
<LD>   In his second major league start, Patterson shut out San Diego
into the eighth inning Thursday as the Arizona Diamondbacks won their
fourth in a row, 10-0, over the Padres.</LD>
<TE>   Matt Williams hit a three-run homer as the Diamondbacks extended
their lead in the National League West to a season-high four games
over San Francisco and the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson (1-0) gave up five hits in 7 1/3 innings in his first
major league victory. He left the game to a standing ovation after
giving up singles to Gene Kingsdale and Trenidad Hubbard in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   In the clubhouse, teammates doused Patterson with beer.</TE>
<TE>   The outing matched the longest for Patterson since he missed
nearly all of the 2000 season because of elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I could do this. I learned the work that it took to be a
major league pitcher and stay consistent, and not just come in for a
couple of starts and disappear," he said. "Yeah, I always believed I
could do this. It's not really a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   The 24-year-old right-hander was brought up as a stop-gap when
Rick Helling went on the injured list with a sore right ankle.
Helling is scheduled to come back for his next start Aug. 2.</TE>
<TE>   In two starts, both against San Diego, since being called up from
triple-A Tucson, Patterson has given up one run and eight hits in 13
1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't figure him out," Padre Manager Bruce Bochy said. "He
threw strikes, had good command. He has good stuff."</TE>

<LD>Ichiro Suzuki hit his second homer in three games and Seattle starter
John Halama won again as the Mariners beat the Texas Rangers, 7-2,
Thursday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 26th homer of the season for the
last-place Rangers, who lost their sixth consecutive series. It was
Palmeiro's 473rd career home run, good for 22nd all-time. Willie
Stargell and Stan Musial are next on the career list with 475 homers
apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Staying a game ahead of Angels in the AL West, the Mariners scored
five runs in the second inning off Aaron Myette (0-2). After a walk
to Mike Cameron and a single by Ben Davis, Suzuki homered to right
field to give Seattle a 4-1 lead. It was Suzuki's sixth homer of the
season and fourth since the All-Star break.</LD>
<TE>   Mark McLemore walked and John Olerud singled before Bret Boone
doubled for Seattle's last two runs in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Halama (5-3), improved to 4-0 in six starts as the second
left-hander in Seattle's rotation behind Jamie Moyer. In five
innings, he gave up two runs, seven hits and two walks, with no
strikeouts. Halama has spent most of the season in Seattle's bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro, tied for third in the AL in homers, hit his 17th
consecutive solo shot in the second to tie the score at 1-1. It was
his 38th homer against the Mariners, the most by a player against
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers got their second run in the fifth on consecutive
singles by Gabe Kapler, Alex Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki went three for four to raise his batting average to .363,
tops in the majors. He has a 10-game hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Tampa Bay 0--Pedro Martinez struck out 11 and gave up
two hits in eight innings, and the Red Sox won at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Trot Nixon hit his 15th homer of the season, a two-run shot in the
first, and Manny Ramirez and Jason Varitek hit consecutive homers off
Luis De Los Santos (0-2) in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (13-2) is 5-0 in his last seven starts. In his last five,
his ERA is 0.79 with 50 strikeouts, eight walks, 20 hits and three
earned runs in 34 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Kansas City 2--Robert Fick hit a tiebreaking sacrifice
fly in the sixth inning and had a two-run homer as the Tigers
completed a three-game sweep at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Fick also made a key defensive play in right field to preserve the
Tigers' edge.</TE>
<TE>   With the Royals trailing, 3-2, in the eighth, Carlos Beltran
tripled with one out, Joe Randa walked and Raul Ibanez hit a line
drive that Fick caught. But before Beltran could tag up and score,
Fick doubled Randa off first base.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Play Is Still First-Rate</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They defeat A's, 5-4, and remain one game out of
AL West lead. Three-game series against division-leading Mariners
begins tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels boarded a plane for Seattle on Thursday feeling a whole
lot better about themselves than the last time they played in
Washington state.</LD>
<LD>   A 5-4 come-from-behind victory over the Oakland Athletics before
31,653 at Edison Field in the afternoon clinched the series against
the A's, concluded an impressive homestand and sent the Angels into a
three-game series against the first-place Mariners with momentum.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels knew that if the Mariners lost to the Texas Rangers on
Thursday night, they would be tied for first place in the American
League West for the first time this season.</LD>
<TE>   The Mariners won, 7-2, to maintain their one-game lead over the
Angels. Not that it mattered much to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "Being tied for first place in July doesn't do much good other
than put you in position to do something later on," center fielder
Darin Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   Early this season, the Angels looked like anything but contenders.
When they traveled to Seattle in April, they were 6-12. They lost the
first two games of the series to record the worst start in franchise
history before winning the finale and starting the run that brought
them to their current standing as one of the most resourceful teams
in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   This past week, they swept the Mariners in three games for the
first time since 1998 and took two of three games from the
hard-charging A's.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, who saw his patchwork bullpen step up
with Troy Percival on the disabled list, noted the differences in his
club since its last visit to Safeco Field.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a better chance in some areas to get the matchups we want
pitching-wise," Scioscia said. "Offensively, it's like night and day.
We went through that stretch [early in the season] hitting .220 as a
team. Ever since, we're probably close to .290. We're giving our
pitchers enough support to let them relax and make pitches."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Angels had 13 hits--all singles--and overcame a
3-0 deficit. Shortstop David Eckstein had four hits, tying the most
in his career, and drove in the tying run in the sixth. Garret
Anderson had three hits, the biggest one coming with the score tied,
4-4, in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   With runners at first and second, Anderson hit a flare to left
field against Oakland closer Billy Koch. The ball dropped in, scoring
Erstad, who had reached on a fielder's choice and advanced to second
on a wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson wasn't quibbling about how hard he hit the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't even out, so I'll take them as they come," said
Anderson, who is batting .303 and has an 11-game hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein said the Angels were leaving for Seattle as contenders
because several players have been contributing to victories. That's
in marked contrast to early in the season when Anderson was the only
one performing consistently on his way to his first All-Star game
selection.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, reserve outfielder Orlando Palmeiro hit a
three-run double to key a 5-1 victory. On Thursday, Tim Salmon had a
two-run single in the fifth inning and pinch-hitter Jorge Fabregas
delivered a run-scoring single that pulled the Angels to within one
run in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "Day in and day out it's a different guy coming through," Eckstein
said. "Back then, it was, 'Come on, [Garret Anderson]. Let's go.' Now
it's a complete team effort."</TE>
<TE>   No component has been more important recently than the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Scot Shields (3-1) pitched 2 2/3 scoreless innings in relief of
starter Ramon Ortiz on Thursday and compiled four shutout innings
during the homestand.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber pitched the ninth and got three outs on ground balls for
his fifth save.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have come from behind in 30 of their 60 victories.</TE>
<TE>   "The way this team has been coming back, the bullpen just says,
'Let's hold 'em and see what happens,' " Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   With Percival set to come off the disabled list Saturday and
reliever Al Levine looking to make his first appearance since coming
off the disabled list last weekend, the bullpen will be shuffled
again.</TE>
<TE>   But the way the Angels played during their homestand has them
feeling confident about their chances against the Mariners, who have
been to the playoffs in each of the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "They've played some meaningful series over the last couple of
years," Adam Kennedy said. "We're the ones who have to step it up."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Day Off Soon Turns Into Disaster for Glaus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What began as a day off for Troy Glaus turned into another day of
frustration for the Angel third baseman.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia started a lineup that featured six
left-handed batters against Oakland right-hander Cory Lidle on
Thursday. Glaus, who was one for 19 in the first five games of the
homestand, was on the bench.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes, taking a day off gives a guy perspective," Scioscia
said before the game. "Troy's definitely in a little bit of a
downturn right now, but there is a ton of baseball left."</LD>
<TE>   Glaus entered the game as a defensive replacement in the eighth.
With one out, Olmedo Saenz hit a ball to the ground that bounced high
into the air. Glaus fielded the ball bare-handed above his shoulder
and threw the ball past first baseman Scott Spiezio for an error that
sent Saenz to second base.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Glaus struck out against Billy Koch with runners at
first and third after the Angels took a 5-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' only hit during the homestand was a three-run home run
against the Seattle Mariners on Saturday that gave the Angels a 6-5
lead, his first homer since June 28.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus is batting .243 with 16 homers and 67 runs batted in.
However, he is hitting only .195 with five homers and 20 RBIs in his
last 164 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival pitched to five batters in a simulated game
and pronounced himself fit to come off the disabled list Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Percival has been recovering from an infected abrasion on his left
foot, an injury suffered during a family boating trip over the
All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Percival did not give up a hit while facing Jose Nieves, Shawn
Wooten and Jorge Fabregas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Kennedy was ejected by home plate umpire Marty Foster after
Kennedy argued a called third strike to end the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Jose Molina continues to fill in effectively for his
brother, Bengie, who appears to be ahead of schedule in his comeback
from a strained left hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Bengie was put on the 15-day disabled list July 17 and was
initially told he could miss four to six weeks. But he said Thursday
that he might be ready when he is eligible to be activated.</TE>
<TE>   Jose made two good plays in the first inning of the Angels' series
finale against the A's. From his knees, he threw out Terrence Long
attempting to steal second base. With two out and runners at first
and second, he picked off Miguel Tejada at second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed reliever Scott Schoeneweis was unavailable because of
back stiffness.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Second baseman Ray Durham, the subject of recent trade rumors, was
finally dealt by the Chicago White Sox on Thursday to the Oakland
Athletics for triple-A pitcher Jon Adkins.</LD>
<LD>   The trade, completed after the White Sox agreed to send cash to
pay part of Durham's salary, was announced after Oakland's 5-4 loss
to the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Durham, an All-Star in 1998 and 2000, will join the Athletics in
Texas for tonight's game. The A's are in the middle of the AL West
and wild card races while Chicago is 14 games back in the AL Central.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a talent, this kid," Oakland Manager Art Howe said. "It's
nice to inject that kind of bat into our lineup. He's a switch-hitter
with speed, he's got a lot of tools."</TE>
<TE>   Durham, 30, was hitting .299 with nine homers and 48 runs batted
in.</TE>

<TE>   The Florida Marlins' Spanish-language radio outlet, WQBA-AM, is
cutting costs by broadcasting a four-game series in Montreal this
week from the station's studios in South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast crew includes Hall of Fame play-by-play announcer
Felo Ramirez, who until Thursday's series opener had missed only one
regular-season game in the team's 10-year history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mariano Rivera received a cortisone injection in his strained
right shoulder, and the New York Yankee All-Star closer could be
headed to the disabled list for the second time this season.... The
Houston Astros optioned right-handed pitcher Tim Redding to triple-A
New Orleans and activated righty Dave Mlicki from the disabled list.
Mlicki, scheduled to start today against Pittsburgh, went on the
disabled list May 26 with a strained muscle in his left rib cage.</TE>

<HD>This List Shows Just How Bad TV Can Be</HD>

<LD>Lists seem to be the rage these days. Jerry Greene of the Orlando
Sentinel decided to list the Top 10 Worst TV Sports Shows. His top
three:</LD>
<LD>   3. The Magic Hour. It wasn't a sports show per se, but it would be
wrong to exclude Magic Johnson's 1998 venture into late-night TV. He
was as unintentionally funny as Howie Mandel.</LD>
<LD>   2. The ESPYs. If you just saw it, you don't need an explanation.</LD>
<TE>   1. The XFL. Not the football. The players and coaches did their
best--but you're doomed when somebody decides it's smart to show a
guy standing at a urinal during halftime. And we didn't even mention
the governor of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who won the first Winston Cup race at Indianapolis
Motor Speedway and also at California Speedway?</TE>
<TE>   Changing times: Imagine the looks you would have gotten 20 years
ago, says Terry Foster in the Detroit News, "If you had predicted
that in 2002, the NBA's first draft pick would be from China, a black
man would be the world's greatest golfer, the American League's top
hitter would be from Japan, and the NHL's leading scorer would be
black."</TE>
<TE>   Good reason: After playing nine innings Wednesday in 1 hour, 41
minutes--the fastest game in the major leagues since 1984--winning
pitcher Jose Lima of the Detroit Tigers said, "I think the home plate
umpire might have had a date tonight, because he had a big [strike]
zone."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign flavor: Boris Said is one of America's premier road
racers, but he is not happy with what he sees in the American Le Mans
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be called the European Le Mans Series," the Carlsbad
driver complained to Bill Center of the San Diego Union-Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "We pay all the bills, but all the drivers come from Europe.
Porsche sells many of its cars here but puts only little German
factory guys in their race cars."</TE>
<TE>   Bad timing: Pittsburgh Pirate manager Lloyd McClendon has called
for 61 intentional walks this year, tops in the National League.</TE>
<TE>   It backfired Wednesday when he had Cincinnati's Brady Clark, a
.196 hitter, intentionally walked.</TE>
<TE>   The next batter, Todd Walker, hit a grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   Lock the doors: Dennis Rodman is back. The former Laker rebounder
is hosting a Rodman's Gone Wild Celebrity Tour extravaganza tonight
in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   To promote the affair, he appeared in Real Detroit magazine
wearing a wedding dress.</TE>
<TE>   Just asking: From the Vent column in the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution: "I wonder if baseball fans who ordered MLB
Extra Innings on satellite will be able to get refunds if baseball
goes on strike?"</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1984, Pete Rose of the Montreal Expos
tied Ty Cobb's record for most singles, 3,052.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jeff Gordon, in 1994 at Indy and 1997 at Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Shortly before Ted Williams died, he helped his son,
John Henry Williams, hook on with a minor league team. Now the son
wants his dad freeze-dried.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's what Teddy Ballgame would say when he thawed out in a
hundred years," says David Kindred in the Sporting News.</TE>
<TE>   "That idiot kid of mine got a hit yet?"</TE>

<HD>An E-Ticket Ride</HD>
<DH>Doc Allred made a small fortune in the abortion business
and spent one to rescue Los Alamitos; it has been no ordinary life</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best way to make sense of Doc Allred's improbable life and times
is to look back, long before the riches and admirers. Before the
controversy. Before enemies condemned his soul to burn in the fiery
depths of hell.</LD>
<LD>   It was the late 1940s when Allred first saw horses run, brought to
Santa Anita Park by his stepfather and later by his grandmother,
riding a streetcar that came from downtown. Imagine what it was like
for a poor boy. The call to post, colorful silks and thundering
hooves. Like a dream.</LD>
<LD>   Between races, he noticed parimutuel tickets scattered across the
ground. He saw guys walking around, nudging the paper slips with
their shoes, checking to see if anyone had been inattentive or dumb
enough to toss out a winner.</LD>
<TE>   When Allred grew a little bigger, he began pedaling to the track
on Sunday mornings. The clean-up crews did not come until Monday, so
the grandstand would be littered with detritus from the previous day.
Stashing his bike in the bushes, keeping an eye out for the watchman,
he would jump the fence to collect gunny sacks of discarded tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Often there were winners for his stepfather to cash in later. As
Allred says, "We didn't have too much when I was a kid."</TE>
<TE>   This childhood memory contains much pertinent information, threads
of the man Allred would become. The young doctor who, in the late
1960s, spotted opportunity in the abortion business. The aging
millionaire who, years later, poured an unwarranted amount of cash
into a rundown track in Orange County, creating the small gem that is
Los Alamitos Race Course.</TE>
<TE>   And something else about those Sunday mornings. "It was a little
foreboding for a 12-year-old when you knew you weren't supposed to be
there," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But Allred went just the same. He has lived for 66 years on his
own terms, unapologetic, even if it meant irritating allies and
befriending a few adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Country Gentleman</TE>
<TE>   This story would be simpler if it could be contained within the
snug confines of the race track.</TE>
<TE>   On a Friday afternoon Dr. Edward Allred sits at a private table in
a club overlooking the finish line, nibbling slices of watermelon
from a fruit plate and sipping Diet Coke. His style is direct but
hardly brash, his head often ducking as he speaks. He is stocky,
well-groomed in a knit shirt and slacks.</TE>
<TE>   Notice the freshly painted grandstands, he says like a proud
grandfather. See the way the track is tended?</TE>
<TE>   In the sport of quarter horse racing--a stepchild to the more
glamorous, more lucrative thoroughbred scene--this is the
acknowledged Taj Mahal and Allred is irrefutable.</TE>
<TE>   His stable produces winning horses year after year. Though Los
Alamitos is shadowed by thoroughbred showcases Santa Anita, Hollywood
Park and Del Mar, it manages to stage California's richest annual
race, the Los Alamitos Million Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   With horse racing on the decline, bettors lured away by card rooms
and Indian casinos, the man and his millions have propped up an
entire segment of the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our biggest owner, biggest breeder, biggest track operator
and biggest bettor," says Dan Fick, executive director of racing for
the American Quarter Horse Assn. "Day in and day out, we count our
blessings that Doc is involved in our game."</TE>
<TE>   But his story is too big for 136 acres of track and barns, too big
for sport alone. Out in the world, things get trickier.</TE>
<TE>   Though Los Alamitos provides jobs and sales tax to the city of
Cypress, the officialdom views its owner with skepticism, wary of his
desire to bring in slot machines and other forms of gaming. They know
him as a savvy negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes to sit back and say he's a country gentleman," City
Councilman Tim Keenan says. "He's no fool."</TE>
<TE>   In the supercharged atmosphere of reproductive rights, Allred owns
one of the nation's largest privately held chains of abortion
clinics, Family Planning Associates Medical Group, with 21 offices in
California and two in Illinois. His success has brought not only
wealth but protests, death threats and violent attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he has not run to allies for support. When Allred suspected
Planned Parenthood of unfair competition and business practices, he
filed a lawsuit. The women's groups that protest in favor of abortion
he dismisses as "screeching types that seek confrontation."</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the avowed Republican seems more aligned with
conservatives who oppose him. Jack Schuler, an attorney who has sued
him twice for medical malpractice in cases that were settled out of
court, has been quoted as calling him "likable, a good businessman."
Allred gets unexpected praise from a pastor whose organization has
picketed his clinic in Long Beach for 19 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had theological discussions and he has asked my opinion,
which makes him unique among abortionists," says Rev. Al Howard, who
operates a church and home for unwed mothers in Long Beach. "If you
did not know what he did, who he was, if you met him at a party,
you'd think he was a real nice guy."</TE>
<TE>   Howard once invited Allred to speak to his congregation. The
doctor stood before the faithful and issued a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I know your side and I know what you believe," he said. "You
people don't know anything about me. You don't know why I do what I
do."</TE>
<TE>   An Emerging Pattern</TE>
<TE>   Money was key from the start. His father died of tuberculosis when
Allred was 6 and, after that, his mother periodically separated from
his stepfather, an alcoholic. The family stayed with relatives or
friends. A turning point came when Allred was 15, when his parents
divorced and a physician his mother knew from Glendale Adventist
hospital became a guardian angel.</TE>
<TE>   Under this man's guidance, the teenager transferred to a private
academy and became a Seventh-Day Adventist. After high school, he
enrolled at the church-affiliated La Sierra College--now known as La
Sierra University--in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Though Allred was grateful for a new start, he was a bit of a
maverick, a moderate amid conservatives. "I guess I was the campus
liberal," he says. And he wasn't afraid to speak his mind, causing a
stir with a pro-labor editorial in the school newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   A pattern was emerging.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't much later--during a fling with law school at USC--that
Allred found a place where he felt more comfortable. In 1959, still a
fan of racing, he happened upon Los Alamitos and got his first taste
of quarter horses.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd wore cowboy hats and boots, "a lot of Texans and Okies,"
he recalls. It suited a young man who would someday favor car trips
through Arizona and New Mexico, visits to Old West graveyards.</TE>
<TE>   Allred was still broke. He was young, married to his high school
sweetheart, Charmay, and would soon be switching to medical school.
Still, whenever he had money, he went to the races.</TE>
<TE>   The blend of gambling and competition thrilled him. Quarter horses
are smaller and stouter than thoroughbreds, running shorter lengths,
a mad dash down the homestretch. At no point is the action on a
distant portion of the track. Everything happens in front of the
grandstands.</TE>
<TE>   "I fell in love with the short speed," he said. "The beauty of
this type of horse."</TE>
<TE>   But his true involvement in the sport would have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   A Business Decision</TE>
<TE>   After finishing medical school and serving in the Army medical
corps in Vietnam, the 30-year-old Allred returned home in 1967 to
begin a career. He took a job running a small hospital in
South-Central Los Angeles that was struggling to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   "They needed a young, aggressive physician," he says. "They found
me."</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround began when a group of doctors approached him saying
they wanted a place to perform abortions for wealthy clients. The
procedure had been illegal, so Allred thought they were crazy.</TE>
<TE>   But the newly passed Therapeutic Abortion Act, which dealt with
rape and incest, allowed pregnancies to be terminated in cases where
a woman's mental health was endangered. This clause gave doctors more
leeway than politicians had intended. Suddenly, California had the
nation's most liberal abortion law.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Allred's 22-bed Avalon Memorial Hospital took in only a
handful of women each week. Then a faster, safer and cheaper
method--using suction instead of scraping--became available and one
of the doctors, Kenneth Wright, taught it to Allred. The groundwork
was laid for a booming practice.</TE>
<TE>   "We had planeloads of people coming in," Allred says. "We'd meet
them at the airport with a bus."</TE>
<TE>   After the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalized abortion
nationwide in 1973, Family Planning Associates Medical Group began to
expand. Allred was flying from city to city in a private plane,
performing scores of abortions each week. He was also encountering
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   First came protesters and death threats, then violence. A bomb was
planted in his San Diego clinic in 1987. An arsonist set fire to his
Ventura clinic in 1995. His North Hollywood office was firebombed two
years later. Allred talks about this calmly, insisting he has never
understood the fuss.</TE>
<TE>   Having performed hundreds of thousands of abortions, he insists it
was never a question of morals or politics. "I just never thought of
it like that," Allred says. He saw it as a lawful procedure, a
service people wanted, a shrewd business decision.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, however, he acknowledges, "It's not an easy issue
and I can understand the perspective of people who oppose it." He
also has doubts about second-trimester abortions. "I'm not saying
they shouldn't be done at times but they should be given more
thought."</TE>
<TE>   And some ideology sneaks into his dispassionate approach. Allred
has long worried about overpopulation, a concern that persuaded
Charmay and him to forgo having children. This conviction led to a
controversial incident.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, talking to a reporter from the San Diego Union--now the
Union-Tribune--Allred said: "Population control is too important to
be stopped by some right-wing pro-life types. Take the new influx of
Hispanic immigrants. Their lack of respect for democracy and social
order is frightening. I hope I can do something to stem that tide.
I'd set up a clinic in Mexico for free if I could. Maybe one in
Calexico would help. The survival of our society could be at stake."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "When a sullen black woman of 17 or 18 can decide to
have a baby and get welfare and food stamps and become a burden to us
all, it's time to stop. In parts of South Los Angeles having babies
for welfare is the only industry these people have."</TE>
<TE>   Two decades later, Allred winces at the mention of these
statements. He knows how racist they appear and says "that's just not
the way I am."</TE>
<TE>   He talks about his affection for California's Mexican heritage,
his appreciation for the growing number of Latinos who work at and
frequent his track. At the same time, he stands by some of what was
said. Overcrowding still concerns him. He still despises the welfare
system, though critics point out that Medi-Cal has paid for many
abortions at his clinics.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since that article, Allred has avoided the limelight.
He rarely performs abortions anymore. His days are spent golfing, his
nights devoted to more cherished business.</TE>
<TE>   'He Was Crazy'</TE>
<TE>   Racing came to Cypress in 1947 when Frank Vessels Sr. began
holding informal matches behind his house on a 435-acre ranch. The
crowds grew steadily for a decade and he eventually built a proper
track and grandstand. By the late 1960s, Los Alamitos had hit its
stride with an average attendance of more than 9,000, but this heyday
would be brief.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance plummeted in the late 1980s after the Vessels family
sold to Marje Everett, then chairman of Hollywood Park. The grounds
had fallen into disrepair, the grandstands gloomy. "For Marje, I
think it was an afterthought," a racing official says.</TE>
<TE>   Everett responds: "We thought Los Alamitos would be a good
addition. The racing industries are somewhat different. I was 50
years in thoroughbred racing and ... [eventually] we decided to
concentrate on that industry."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Park sold to a harness racing group that had clashed
with quarter horse people over use of the track. But Allred forged a
relationship with the new owners and, in 1990, bought a majority
stake. In 1998, he became sole owner.</TE>
<TE>   The property cost $45 million and needed millions more in
refurbishment such as new paint and a new racing surface. Allred
built a small restaurant at the turn for home where owners and
bettors could watch morning workouts. He turned part of the
grandstand into his pet project, the $5-million Vessels Club with its
$10 cover charge and linens, an upscale menu and a dress code that
irritated some of the blue-jeans crowd.</TE>
<TE>   This was different from his medical practice, not so sensible or
profit-minded.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times I thought he was crazy to keep pouring in money
and I told him that," says his closest friend and golf partner, R.D.
Hubbard, another former Hollywood Park chairman. "He's always been
more interested in the sport than in money."</TE>
<TE>   Physical improvements weren't all Allred brought to Los Alamitos.
Working with owners, he struck a deal by which every horse--not just
the top five finishers--got a slice of the purse. A small difference,
but critical for marginal owners fighting to cover weekly training
costs.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly 500 horses coming out of his ranch in Atascadero,
Allred has kept trainers employed on the backside.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guy who is struggling, Doc will send him three or four
horses," said D. Wayne Lukas, the well-known thoroughbred trainer who
started at Los Alamitos in the early 1970s. "You only do that if you
care about the horsemen. He won't let a guy die."</TE>
<TE>   His Favorite Place</TE>
<TE>   On summer evenings, sunset arrives shortly after post time at Los
Alamitos, bathing the grassy infield in a warm glow.</TE>
<TE>   Fans cluster on the apron near the finish line, eating hot dogs
and drinking beer. There might be a few families with children, a
sprinkling of young men and women, but much of the clientele is in
its 40s and 50s. The serious gamblers stay beneath the stands or in
the clubhouse, hunched over tip sheets, yelling at television
monitors that show races from this and other tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Allred can be found at his table in the quieter, more staid
Vessels Club, where he studies the horses, watches replays on a
private monitor and bets prodigious sums.</TE>
<TE>   His wife and he, still married, no longer live together. He owns
homes on the coast and in the desert and has the ranch, not to
mention a stake in several golf courses. There is nowhere he would
rather be than Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't an ownership," Lukas says. "It is a passion."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't seem to matter that crowds have thinned to an average
of 1,516 as other forms of gaming keep closing in. It doesn't matter
that the track gets most of its $1.2 million in nightly bets from
off-site wagering, faceless gamblers watching on television screens
across the nation.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Aren't Hitting in Stride</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Heart of the offense has gone cold, turning a 2
1/2-game lead in National League West into a four-game deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Closer Eric Gagne has doused his share of fires this season, earning
several of his 35 saves in heroic fashion, but unless the Dodgers
find some way to ignite their offense, their playoff hopes will flame
out like the embers of a dying campfire.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers have lost 11 of 14 games since the All-Star break,
their 2 1/2-game lead over Arizona in the National League West
turning into a four-game deficit entering a critical three-game
series against the San Francisco Giants starting tonight in Pac Bell
Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, Montreal Expos and Houston
Astros have also closed a considerable amount of ground on the
Dodgers and Giants in the wild-card race.</LD>
<TE>   While the Dodger starting pitchers, particularly left-hander
Odalis Perez and right-hander Andy Ashby, have wobbled in the last
two weeks and the bullpen in front of Gagne and set-up man Paul
Quantrill has faltered, it's the offense that has taken the most
hits--far more than it has dished out--during the Dodgers' slump.</TE>
<TE>   A team that averaged six runs a game from mid-May to mid-June has
scored more than four runs once in the last 14 games. The Dodgers
have scored 37 runs in the second half, an average of 2.6 runs a
game, and have been held to two runs or fewer nine times.</TE>
<TE>   Ten times in the last 18 games, the Dodgers have fallen behind
during the first two innings, a trend that has further pressured a
pitching staff that is beginning to feel it must shut out an opponent
to give the Dodgers a chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the Dodger lineup--Paul Lo Duca, Shawn Green, Eric
Karros and Brian Jordan--has combined to hit .210 (42 for 200) with
two home runs and 12 runs batted in since the break. The cleanup spot
has not produced an RBI in that span.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, the team's most consistent hitter, has had a particularly
rough time, going 10 for 56 (.179) with one homer and five RBIs, his
average falling from .326 on July 7 to .303.</TE>
<TE>   And Green, whose remarkable power binge resulted in 23 home runs
in 38 games from May 21 to July 3, is batting .208 (11 for 53) with
one homer and two RBIs since the break and is getting fewer and fewer
prime pitches to hit. Green hasn't had an extra-base hit in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   The low point may have come Wednesday, when the Dodgers suffered
their league-leading 11th shutout at the hands of the San Diego
Padres and failed to advance a runner to second base.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been frustrating," Green said. "We played a good game
Tuesday night [an 8-6 victory over the Padres], and you start to
think things are going to get better. We're having better at-bats.
Hopefully some balls will fall in, we'll have some big innings,
string together some good wins, and we'll be on our way."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers struggled to score in the first six weeks, the depths
of their futility coming May 14-15, when they were shut out in
consecutive games by the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-3 victory over Montreal the following night jump-started the
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Green went on his tear, which included his memorable four-homer
game on May 23 in Milwaukee, and the Dodgers, fueled by a
higher-octane offense, won 30 of 43 games from May 16-July 2 to
improve from 22-18 to 52-31.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers haven't received a similar spike from any of their
second-half wins, losing five in a row after a July 14 victory over
Arizona, two in a row after a July 20 win over San Francisco and
getting shut out after Tuesday's win over San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of utility player Tyler Houston, acquired in a trade
with Milwaukee on Tuesday, could help. Houston, who bats left-handed,
hit .302 with seven homers and 33 RBIs in 76 games for the Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   Houston will join the Dodgers tonight, and he should get plenty of
at-bats, most of them in a third-base platoon with Adrian Beltre and
several off the bench as a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, Houston should light a fire under the
underachieving Beltre, who has had virtually no competition at third
base since he made his Dodger debut in 1998 and has not been able to
lift his average above .240 since June 28.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans felt strengthening the bench and bullpen
before Wednesday's non-waiver trade deadline would be best for the
club, but he did make a run at Philadelphia third baseman Scott Rolen
last week.</TE>
<TE>   According to baseball sources, talks heated up between Evans and
Phillies' General Manager Ed Wade, but Evans backed off when Wade
requested Beltre, a major league pitcher and a minor league pitcher
in return for Rolen, who is owed an additional $2.9 million this
season and will be a free agent next winter. Evans got Houston
instead.</TE>
<TE>   "My objectives haven't changed because I don't think our needs
have changed," Evans said. "I think this [offensive slump] is going
to end soon, and we're going to be OK. I don't want to do something
in reaction to what's happened the last two weeks."</TE>

<HD>Article Links Supplements and Heatstroke</HD>
<DH>Football: Editorial in medical journal says dietary aids
may be factor in surge of player deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ephedrine and creatine use among football players may be a factor in
a surge of heatstroke deaths in the sport since 1995, according to an
editorial published in a medical journal today.</LD>
<LD>   The article appears in the journal "Neurosurgery" and contends
dietary supplements designed to enhance performance may have a
significant impact on the body's ability to remain properly hydrated
during stressful exercise in hot weather.</LD>
<LD>   It is co-authored by Dr. Julian Bailes, chair of neurosurgery at
West Virginia University and a consultant to the NFL Players Assn.;
Dr. Robert C. Cantu of Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass.; and Dr.
Arthur L. Day of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.</LD>
<TE>   Bailes, principal author of the report, said it is the first
article in a medical journal linking ephedrine, creatine and
heatstroke deaths in football.</TE>
<TE>   The subject of heat-related fatalities is particularly timely
because it is raised a year after Minnesota Viking tackle Korey
Stringer became the first NFL player to die of heatstroke.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplements containing ephedrine, a stimulant, were found
in Stringer's locker. Lawyers for his family contend "absolutely
clean" toxicology tests showed the player had no supplements in his
system.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL last season added ephedrine to its list of banned
substances and July 1 began randomly testing players for the
stimulant. Creatine is not on the banned substances list, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Our doctors say creatine does not pose significant risks and does
not need to be on the list," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. "Our
people have identified ephedrine as a much more dangerous substance."</TE>
<TE>   League officials sent a letter to all players on July 11
emphasizing the dangers of ephedrine, the unfair competitive
advantage it could provide and the negative message supplement use
sends to younger players. The letter also said players will not be
punished for taking ephedra-based cold and allergy medications in
prescribed amounts.</TE>
<TE>   The journal article cites statistics from the National Center for
Catastrophic Sports Injury Research that document an average of 4.4
heatstroke-related football deaths from 1965 through '74, before
awareness of proper hydration was widespread; an annual average of
1.7 such deaths over the next 10 years; then a reversal in recent
years--after the 1994 deregulation of dietary supplements--with four
deaths each in 1995, '98 and 2000, and three in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors contend in the article that ephedrine and related
compounds sold as "herbal energy" products can have serious side
effects on the heart and central nervous system, while increasing the
body's core temperature and decreasing its ability to cool.</TE>
<TE>   Creatine, marketed as a muscle builder, can increase the
likelihood of heatstroke because it has been shown to shift body
water from the bloodstream into the muscle cells, the article says.</TE>
<TE>   In comments published with the article, Dr. Allan M. Levy, an
associate team physician for the New York Giants, warns of another
dangerous concoction.</TE>
<TE>   "The combination of ephedra, caffeine and aspirin causes weight
loss by allowing the body to convert calories to heat rather than
fat, thereby increasing core body temperature," Levy writes, adding
caffeine already dehydrates the body. "This combination is widely
available and in frequent use by conditioning athletes."</TE>

<HD>Kings Sign a Top Prospect</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Forward Cammalleri forgoes senior season at
Michigan to turn pro.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with the possibility of losing a top prospect, the Kings opened
their bankbook Thursday and signed forward Michael Cammalleri to a
three-year contract worth about $3.15 million.</LD>
<LD>   Cammalleri, a second-round pick in the 2000 NHL entry draft,
informed the Kings through his agent last week that he would not
return for his senior season at Michigan and was looking into playing
junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League.</LD>
<LD>   Had he chosen that option, Cammalleri would have become an
unrestricted free agent after next season.</LD>
<TE>   "That increased their leverage, and we increased our offer and got
the contract done," said Dave Taylor, King general manager. "We've
been talking for a while, but it really picked up in the last week."</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri's deal includes a signing bonus of more than $1 million
stretched over the first two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a few options that I was looking over," said Cammalleri,
20. "Obviously signing with L.A. was one of them. To do it is really
exciting for me. ... It has always been my dream to play in the
National Hockey League."</TE>
<TE>   Considered among the best players in college hockey, the 5-foot-9,
188-pound Cammalleri has the potential to play on one of the Kings'
top two lines next season, perhaps with center Jason Allison and
right wing Adam Deadmarsh, Taylor said. Training camp opens Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a big guy, but he's very strong and very mature," Taylor
said. "He has excelled at every level of hockey he has played. The
next step is to prove he can do it at the professional level."</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri's stock has risen dramatically since he was drafted. He
led Michigan to the NCAA Final Four in each of the last two seasons,
scoring a team-high 23 goals last season despite missing 15 games
because of mononucleosis. He led the Wolverines with 29 goals in
2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   A native of the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, Cammalleri was
the leading scorer with 11 points in the 2002 World Junior
Championships in the Czech Republic while playing for silver-medalist
Canada. He was selected the tournament's top forward.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a player who has always been looked upon to produce
offensively, and I've always been able to do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri said he was impressed with the Kings' organization and
recalled that amateur scout Mark Bavis was perhaps most responsible
for the team drafting him. Bavis and another King scout, Ace Bailey,
were killed Sept. 11 when their flight from Boston to Los Angeles was
hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was drafted by the Kings, I was told that Mark really
wanted me to be a King," he said. "It has been really special to me
that he liked me as a player. I got to know him a little bit. He was
extremely nice to me and a great person."</TE>

<HD>Lakers, Shaw Have a Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers and guard Brian Shaw have agreed to terms on a one-year
contract for the veterans' minimum of $1.03 million, league sources
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A Laker reserve in each of the club's three recent championship
seasons, Shaw, 36, has become a reliable and triangle-savvy backup to
Derek Fisher and Kobe Bryant, particularly in the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Phil Jackson prefers tall, veteran guards, accounting for
his affinity for the likes of the steady Shaw. Shaw, who is 6-6,
averaged 2.9 points and 1.9 rebounds in 58 games in the regular
season. By the end of March, however, Shaw was gathering minutes in
preparation for the playoffs, during which he averaged 12.5 minutes,
16.3 in the NBA Finals.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers released and re-signed Shaw for about half his
potential salary early last season, a transaction designed to keep
the club beneath the estimated luxury-tax threshold. A week ago, the
league announced there would be no payroll tax.</TE>
<TE>   The club also expects to announce a contract agreement with
forward Slava Medvedenko shortly, along with a non-guaranteed,
one-year deal for Jannero Pargo, a 6-foot-2 guard from Arkansas who
played well for the Lakers in the summer league.</TE>
<TE>   The imminent signing of Medvedenko will bring the Laker roster to
12 players under guaranteed contracts, with a slim chance General
Manager Mitch Kupchak would add a 13th--a backup center,
preferably--before training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Shaquille O'Neal will seek at least one more opinion
regarding treatment on his arthritic toe before deciding on a course
of treatment. So far, recommendations have ranged from surgery to a
program of physical therapy.</TE>
<TE>   The team expects O'Neal will be ready in time for training camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Golden State Warriors will make Atlanta Hawk assistant Eric
Musselman, 37, the youngest head coach in the NBA today, according to
team and league sources. Musselman, the son of late Minnesota coach
Bill Musselman, would take over from interim Coach Brian Winters, who
got the job when Dave Cowens was fired last December.... The
Philadelphia 76ers signed guard Greg Buckner, 24, to a six-year,
$18-million contract and forward Monty Williams, 30, to a two-year
deal reportedly worth $875,000.... The Utah Jazz signed free-agent
guard Calbert Cheaney, 31.</TE>

<LD>   Norris has done that well this season, winning two of five races,
claiming two poles and leading second-place Austin Cameron by 52
points with five races remaining, beginning with Saturday night's
Jani-King 200 at Irwindale Speedway.</LD>
<TE>   "I started out racing as a hobby, but it has become my passion,"
said Norris, who lives in Dana Point with his wife, Stephanie, and
three daughters. "I'd do it full-time, but you can't make a living
running Winston West, so I have to keep on working. I enjoy stunt
work, but I've got to the point where I'd rather plan and coordinate
them rather than do them myself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no adrenalin junkie who gets a kick out of scaring himself to
death."</TE>
<TE>   He was director of "Walker, Texas Ranger," starring his father,
which used to air weekly on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Norris, whose wins came at California Speedway and Evergreen
Speedway, in Monroe, Wash., hopes to parlay his Winston West
successes into a Busch Grand National or a Craftsman Truck ride next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Like everything else in racing, it all comes to finding a
sponsor," he said. "There's a big difference between what we're doing
and what we'd like to do, but that's not going to stop us from
trying."</TE>
<TE>   The budget to run in the Busch series is between $4 million and $5
million. Norris' Winston West budget is between $600,000 and
$700,000.</TE>
<TE>   Norris and Matt Stowe, co-owner of the car, will collect a $10,000
bonus from Winston this week as the leader at the midpoint in the
series.</TE>
<TE>   "The bonus money came down to Cameron and us at Monroe. We had to
finish second, even if he won and that's the way it looked like it
was going to finish. We were just cruising along behind Cameron when
he ran out of gas on the last lap, and there we were, in front."</TE>
<TE>   So, instead of carrying a two-point lead into Saturday night's
200-lap race, Norris is 52 in front.</TE>
<TE>   "Irwindale is our most important race," said Norris. "Jani-King
sponsors our car, and they're also sponsoring the race, so a couple
of hundred people will be there from the company. And my dad and all
the family will be there too.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the Irwindale track, but I hate my finishes there. I've
never had any luck, but we're coming to Saturday night's race with a
whole new set-up for the track and we figure to have a shot at
winning."</TE>
<TE>   In three races at Irwindale last year, Norris finished ninth twice
and 20th once.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have the same car that won at Monroe," he said. "It's about
6 years old and was driven by Michael Waltrip in Winston Cup before
we got it, but Jerry Pitts and the crew has it running like a new
car.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between this year and the last couple is that
we've quit having bad luck. We don't look for good luck necessarily,
but we like to avoid bad luck, and that's the way it's been this
year. We've paid our dues, so it's our turn to reap the rewards of
the seeds we've sewn the past four years."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron, a winner at Irwindale in 1999 and a winner this year at
Phoenix and Las Vegas, will challenge Norris in a Chevrolet. The El
Cajon driver has been fast qualifier in three of the last four races.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 200-lap main event, there will be late models
and Grand American modifieds on the program.</TE>
<TE>   Stock Car Hall of Fame</TE>
<TE>   Thirty stock car racing personalities, headed by Jackie McCoy, Ray
Elder and Hershel McGriff, will be inducted into the West Coast Stock
Car Hall of Fame tonight at the Sheraton Four Points hotel in
Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy is the winningest driver in what has become the Winston West
series, winning 54 races and two championships. He is also author of
a definitive history of West Coast stock car racing: "Racing's Real
McCoy," ($39.95, McRacebook Publishing, Modesto). In its 550 pages
are summaries of every Winston West race since 1954, when it was the
Pacific Coast Late Model series.</TE>
<TE>   Elder is a five-time Winston West champion and the only Winston
West driver to win a Winston Cup race against big-name drivers. He
did it twice, in 1971 and 1972 at Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   McGriff was voted most popular Winston West driver for 12
consecutive years and retired only this year at California Speedway
at the age of 74. He is the series' oldest winner, having won at Mesa
Marin Raceway in Bakersfield in 1989 when he was 61.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the banquet, many of the honorees will participate
in the second annual West Coast Stock Car Reunion at Irwindale
Speedway before Saturday night's Winston West main event. The
inaugural inductees:</TE>
<TE>   Drivers--McCoy, Elder, McGriff, Bill Amick, Danny Letner, Eddie
Gray, Johnny Soares Sr., Lloyd Dane, Lou Figaro, Marvin Panch, Marvin
Porter, Parnelli Jones, Ron Hornaday Sr., Scotty Cain, Troy Ruttman,
Bill Schmitt, Jim Insolo, Jim Robinson, Roy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Promoters--Les Richter, Bob Barkhimer, J.C. Agajanian, Ken Clapp,
Charlie Curryer.</TE>
<TE>   Car owners--Bruce Alexander, Carl Dane, Cos Cancilla, Jim Dane,
Ernie Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Car builder--Bill Stroppe.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   While defending Sprint Car Racing Assn. champion Cory Kruseman of
Ventura is showing the Midwesterners how racing is done on the West
Coast, the SCRA will hold its final local race Saturday night at
Perris Auto Speedway until September before heading east.</TE>
<TE>   Kruseman won the first three features in last week's Indiana
Sprint Week series, winning Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights at Gas
City, Putnamville and Haubstadt. The series continues tonight in
Bloomington, Saturday in Terre Haute and Sunday in Kokomo.</TE>
<TE>   Following Saturday night's Perris main event, the SCRA will
compete in the opening rounds of the Non-Wing World Championship in
Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kansas before returning to
Perris on Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time champion Richard Griffin won last week in Santa Maria,
his third win this season, but he has not won at Perris since
September.</TE>
<TE>   While the SCRA is gone, Perris will host the Ventura Racing Assn.
sprint cars on Aug. 3 and 17.</TE>
<TE>   The VRA's home track will be taken over for the Ventura County

<DL></DL>
<LD>French skating judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne is dropping an appeal of
her three-year suspension in the Winter Olympics pairs' scandal,
saying she can't afford it.</LD>
<LD>   Le Gougne and French federation chief Didier Gailhaguet were
suspended in April by the International Skating Union until 2005 for
their role in the judging controversy at the Salt Lake City Games.
They also were barred from the 2006 Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   The ISU Council said it had ample evidence that Le Gougne was
pressured by Gailhaguet into voting for the Russians over the
Canadians in the pairs event. Both couples wound up with gold medals.</LD>
<TE>   Le Gougne filed a 46-page appeal with the ISU's appeals commission
on June 25, claiming the council had denied her due process and had
failed to produce evidence against her.</TE>
<TE>   Gailhaguet announced on July 5 that he would not appeal, citing a
desire to mend ties with the ISU.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne's lawyer, Erik Christiansen, said Thursday the French
federation decided June 29 that it did not have the money to fund her
appeal.</TE>

<HD>Saarloos Is Completely Different</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kirk Saarloos knows why he pitched the Houston Astros' first complete
game this season.</LD>
<LD>   "Confidence is the difference," Saarloos said after limiting the
Pittsburgh Pirates to six hits as the Astros beat the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 8-0, Thursday at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Saarloos won his second start since being called up from triple-A
New Orleans on Saturday. He made his major league debut in June, but
was 0-2 in three starts with a 17.65 earned-run average before he was
sent down June 30. Since his return, the 23-year-old has given up one
run in 14 innings.</LD>
<TE>   "The first time I was up here, I didn't know many faces," said
Saarloos, a former Cal State Fullerton standout. "I didn't go to
spring training with the major league club, so I didn't know these
guys and I really wanted to do well the first time up to show them I
could. I put a lot of pressure on myself then."</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos (2-2) didn't walk a batter as he pitched the team's first
shutout since Roy Oswalt did it against Milwaukee Sept. 9, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   No Astro starter had pitched into the ninth inning this season
before Saarloos, who struck out six.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Brad Ausmus said Saarloos is no fluke.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after he had a rough start in Milwaukee his first time up, I
still felt he would succeed at this level," Ausmus said.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as he keeps the ball down, he's going to get a lot of
ground balls and beat people."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Bagwell improved his July average to .352, best among NL
first basemen and second only to the Yankees' Jason Giambi (.353) in
the majors. After hitting .200 in June, Bagwell's season average has
risen 20 points to .276.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, San Francisco 3--J.D. Drew homered and drove in four
runs, sending Travis Smith and the Cardinals to victory over the
Giants at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis, 9-4 since the All-Star break, finished a seven-game
trip with another strong outing from Smith, the rookie who was
recalled from the minors after Darryl Kile died last month.</TE>
<TE>   Smith (4-1), who wasn't even in St. Louis' plans for this season a
few months ago, has won three of his five starts since being brought
up. He held San Francisco's patchwork lineup to seven hits over six
innings while striking out six.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' Tsuyoshi Shinjo left in the third inning with a
strained right hamstring after an awkward slide at second base.
Shinjo was placed on the 15-day disabled list after the game and the
Giants recalled outfielder Tony Torcato, their first-round draft pick
in 1998, from triple-A Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds and Reggie Sanders didn't play in the St. Louis series
because of hamstring injuries and catcher Benito Santiago was
sidelined for two because of a sty in his left eye.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Chicago 2--Tomas Perez hit a bases-loaded triple
and then made a daring dash home in the eighth inning for the
Phillies at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs' Fred McGriff hit his 470th career homer.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3, Montreal 2--Juan Encarnacion singled through a drawn-in
infield to drive in the go-ahead run in the ninth inning for the
Marlins at Montreal.</TE>

<HD>Surf Event Is More Like Festival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The banners have been unfurled in downtown Huntington Beach. The sand
has been combed and the infrastructure is in place. The world's best
surfers are making their annual trek to the south side of the city's
historic pier, pointed toward the Philips U.S. Open of Surfing.</LD>
<LD>   Former world champions Kelly Slater, Tom Curren and Lisa Andersen
are among about 500 contestants scheduled to compete at the World
Qualifying Series event, which begins Monday and concludes Aug. 4.
They can expect another face-to-face meeting with thousands of
sun-drenched fans, new and old, who have broadened this venue into
the most spectator-friendly in the sport and kept the industry
relatively bullet proof during the recent stock market slump.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest changes are occurring behind the scenes, and behind
the grandstands. Philips Electronics, which has returned for a second
year as title sponsor, has teamed with International Management
Group, a sports and celebrity management firm with a client list that
includes Tiger Woods, Arnold Palmer, Venus and Serena Williams, Derek
Jeter and Bob Costas. Although both corporations are relatively new
to surfing, they've combined to develop a multi-faceted event they
hope will attract more than just surf fans.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to seven days of surfing, visitors can watch
skateboarding and BMX competitions, visit 60 to 70 sponsor booths and
exhibits or check out a digital lounge that will feature an extensive
hands-on display of products, where they can even burn their own CDs
and DVDs. There will also be a digital house of the future with
advanced electronics in every room.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to offer something for everybody," said James Leitz,
vice president of extreme sports at IMG, which bought production
rights from longtime promoter Ian Cairns shortly before last year's
event. "We recognize that the spectators and those in the industry
want more from their events. The festival-like atmosphere seems to be
what people are into."</TE>
<TE>   The return of Philips as title sponsor was a significant first
step. Since 1994, eight companies have paid close to $1 million to
list their name in concert with the U.S Open of Surfing.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason for the high turnover has been simple, those
involved with the tour say. Sponsors didn't feel like they could make
a connection between their products and the consumer, leaving many
feeling oversold and undelivered. Leitz said sponsorship, the main
revenue stream for the event, is already up 70% over last year. Other
signs of success are showing up, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "The buzz on the street tells us we're on to something,'' said
Leitz, who predicts 200,000 people will visit the event.</TE>
<TE>   Beck's Back</TE>
<TE>   Life as a professional surfer has been grand for Holly Beck,
almost as good as the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Beck, who grew up in Palos Verdes, is experiencing her first full
season on the women's pro circuit. Two weeks ago, she enjoyed her
best result in a major event, reaching the quarterfinals of the
Billabong Pro in Jeffreys Bay, South Africa. She's in Huntington
Beach to compete next week in the $30,000 Havaianas Women's Pro, the
highest-rated women's event on the WQS tour. She's part of a growing
group of females taking up the sport, a market Hollywood is trying to
corner with the August release of "Blue Crush," a movie about a young
woman determined to pursue a surfing career.</TE>
<TE>   Beck enjoyed the movie during a sneak preview and hopes it will
get more females serious about the sport. "A lot of girls tend to be
summer surfers," she said. "They go to the beach but don't make the
transition to surfing in the winter and entering contests. I want to
have more intermediate camps, not just for beginners, but encourage
girls to pursue the sport and not just the lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Beck, 20, is older than the average rookie on tour, but she has
good reason. She put off her professional career to pursue a
bachelor's degree in psychology at UC San Diego, a goal she completed
in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "If I took a break I would have had a hard time getting back,"
Beck said. Fortunately, UC San Diego also has one of the best breaks
close by, Black's Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice because the waves are always good at Black's," said
Beck, who also models.</TE>
<TE>   "At other schools, they're only good at certain times of the day,
making it too tempting to blow off class."</TE>
<TE>   Slater to Be Honored</TE>
<TE>   Slater will be inducted into the Walk of Fame and Hall of Fame
next week in downtown Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Slater, who received a wild-card entry into next week's event,
will be inducted into the Walk of Fame on Thursday and the Hall of
Fame Aug. 2. Both are located near Main Street and Pacific Coast
Highway. The six-time world champion came out of semi-retirement
after receiving a full season wild card by the Assn. of Surfing
Professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simple," he said of his comeback. "I'd like to win another
world title. I plan on giving myself this year to really get back
into feeling out the competition."</TE>
<TE>   Slater, 29, from Cocoa Beach, Fla., is the sport's most decorated
athlete.</TE>
<TE>   He won his first world title at 20 in his rookie season on tour in
1992, becoming the youngest surfer to win the world championship.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he semi-retired at the end of 1998, Slater had a
record six world titles, including five straight, and had amassed the
most prize money in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Slater showed he still has the ability to be successful at the
highest level, winning the Quiksilver In Memory of Eddie Aikau big
wave contest in January, held in 20-foot surf at Waimea Bay in
Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Surf Watch</TE>
<TE>   According to Sean Collins at Surflink, the surf forecasting
service for the ASP, the best conditions should roll in late next
week, with a possible second southern swell arriving in time for the
finals. He said swells should reach three to five feet by Thursday,
with an occasional seven-footer. The swell could arrive as early as
Wednesday and should last until Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A hurricane is also brewing deep inside Baja and is expected to
produce some powerful waves this weekend and possibly into Monday's
opening day. Hurricane Elida, the second hurricane to originate off
Baja this week, has the potential to be elevated to a category 5, the
highest rating possible, and bring sustained winds of 140 to 170
knots, Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that it's too early to tell if there's another hurricane
behind Elida, but the conditions are favorable.</TE>
<TE>   "The tropics off Mexico are extremely active," Collins said
Wednesday afternoon. "Usually the first two [hurricanes] will go
through and suck up most of the moisture, then a third comes through
and doesn't have much pop. But that's not always the case."</TE>
<TE>   Climb Stories</TE>
<TE>   Eric Simonson, world-renowned mountaineer, will speak Saturday at
10 a.m. at the Oakley World Headquarters in Foothill Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Simonson will speak and show slides from his adventures climbing
Mt. Everest and from his 1999 and 2001 Mallory &amp; Irvine Research
Expeditions, which were successful in finding clues about the history
of the world's highest mountain.</TE>
<TE>   His team also found the body of pioneer explorer George Mallory in
1999, solving the mystery of who reached the summit first.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Simonson's team was recognized for its heroic efforts in
rescuing five stranded climbers on Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Eric and his team led the all-women's No Boundaries
expedition.</TE>

<LD>Who needs a stuffed Rally Monkey when you have David Eckstein, a
living, breathing, nonstop Rally Man?</LD>
<LD>   Who needs a made-up talisman when you have a ferocious munchkin
who refuses to see what he can't do and keeps doing things he's not
supposed to do?</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein tied Thursday's Angel game against Oakland with an
infield single, a searing whack that caromed off the opposing pitcher
as if it were an eight ball headed into the corner pocket. This was a
pitcher who, Eckstein admitted cheerily, "embarrassed me last week."</LD>
<TE>   And who needs star closer Troy Percival when you have a
31-year-old rookie named Brendan Donnelly? Donnelly keeps getting
recalled from Salt Lake City and getting sent back down. He has
retired 28 of the last 31 major league batters he's faced and 15 of
those struck out. He didn't pitch Thursday because he'd worked the
four previous games. But he wanted to.</TE>
<TE>   So Scot Shields and Ben Weber cleaned up after Ramon Ortiz this
time. Shields, 27, also started this season in Salt Lake City. He got
the win against Oakland by pitching 2 2/3 innings and not giving up a
run of his own (he did throw a wild pitch that let one in, but that
was charged to Ortiz).</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels having scrambled from behind for the win (the 30th
time they've come from behind to win), some of the 31,653 fans may
have wished that Percival were off the disabled list and ready to
close. He will be soon enough. And the Angels do need him.</TE>
<TE>   But it's time we start believing in all the other Angels. Weber
could hardly wait to sprint to the mound and close out this 5-4
triumph.</TE>
<TE>   "How can this not be fun?" Weber said. "Give me the ball."</TE>
<TE>   It's fun when Weber can coax pinch-hitter David Justice into a
timid groundout to second baseman Benji Gil, frustrate Terrence Long
into a weak groundout to first baseman Scott Spiezio and induce
Miguel Tejada to sharply ground out to Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, everything comes back to Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   "He is our catalyst," Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's defeated all odds," Darin Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Eckstein chronicled his five at-bats. One out,
four singles. A run scored. A run batted in.</TE>
<TE>   He took bad swings during the first at-bat, when he led off the
first inning, he said. He wound up lining out to the shortstop, but
it took Cory Lidle eight pitches to nudge the pesky Eckstein into
making that out.</TE>
<TE>   "My second time, [Lidle] had me at 2-2," Eckstein said. "He's
trying to get a fastball past me inside. I hit it where they weren't.
I can't take credit for that hit. It wasn't me."</TE>
<TE>   But it was, of course. It was Eckstein, fighting to make contact
on that inside pitch because everybody tries to pitch him inside,
convinced he can't hit the inside pitch.</TE>
<TE>   On this homestand, six games against Seattle and Oakland, both
playoff teams the last two years, Eckstein went 11 for 21 with six
RBIs. He hit the inside pitches. And the outside pitches. The balls
and the strikes. The Angels won five of the six games.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein's third at-bat Thursday was huge. It was in the fifth
inning. The A's had just hit Ortiz for three runs. With one out, Jose
Molina on first and an 0-2 count, Eckstein singled.</TE>
<TE>   "He came with two fastballs, then tried to get me on a split
finger," Eckstein said. "I hit it pretty hard."</TE>
<TE>   He would score on Tim Salmon's two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were down, 4-2, when they came up in the sixth. They
scored a run and Oakland brought in Chad Bradford in place of Lidle.</TE>
<TE>   "Bradford had eaten me up in Oakland last week," Eckstein said.
"He got me to pop up. He got me to ground out. So this was a good
challenge for me. The angle he throws from, it should be good for me.
He threw me a fastball, outside, then a slider for a strike and
another fastball, inside. I stayed on it."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein crunched it so hard that even though the ball didn't
leave the infield, ricocheting in the direction of the second
baseman, Eckstein was dusting himself off at first while the ball was
still spinning.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Palmeiro scored on the infield single to tie it, 4-4. The
crowd was splitting ears with noise.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the eighth, Eckstein singled again, on an inside
fastball. He was forced out by Erstad, but Eckstein's hard slide at
second helped get Erstad safely to first. And Erstad would score the
winning run on a Garret Anderson hit.</TE>
<TE>   Because Eckstein is only 5 feet 8 and doesn't have much power and
isn't the fastest guy on the stopwatch, no one ever much wanted him.</TE>
<TE>   He's a 27-year-old dervish who swings so frantically in the warmup
area that it seems certain his arms will fly off. Doubters keep
waiting for Eckstein to fail, for major league pitching to befuddle
him, for his size to make it hard to field his position.</TE>
<TE>   "The experts look for that one outstanding thing," Percival said.
"Eck's thing is that he does everything right. It's easy to overlook
that."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein is a lot like the Angels in that way. The baseball world
keeps waiting for the Angels to fail, to fall out of contention, to
be pretenders.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland traded for Chicago White Sox second baseman Ray Durham
after this game. There will be frustrated Angel fans who wonder why
General Manager Bill Stoneman hasn't done something to make the
Angels better.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe he shouldn't. Maybe what the Angels have is enough.
Maybe what they have can't be made any better by somebody else's
discard. Maybe, like Eckstein, the Angels are finding their level. At
the top.</TE>

<HD>Note Says Williams Wished to Be Frozen</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Children John Henry and Claudia Williams
claim signed document supersedes baseball great's will.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Four years after signing a will calling for his cremation, baseball
great Ted Williams entered a pact with two of his children asking
that his body be frozen, according to court documents filed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Williams' scrawled signature, along with those of son John Henry
and daughter Claudia, appears at the bottom of a handwritten note on
a scrap of paper dated Nov. 2, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "JHW, Claudia and Dad all agree to be put into bio-stasis after we
die," reads the pact, written with a ballpoint blue pen. "This is
what we want, to be able to be together in the future, even if it is
only a chance."</LD>
<TE>   Family attorney Bob Goldman said the note was written in a
Gainesville hospital room four days before the Hall of Fame slugger
had a pacemaker installed.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said John Henry Williams wrote the note and that it
would supersede the wishes detailed in Williams' 1996 will.</TE>
<TE>   The slugger's three children have been fighting over his remains
since he died July 5 at the age of 83.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams has had his father's body preserved at a
cryonics lab in Arizona, where the dead are frozen in the hope they
can be resurrected someday.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell, the half-sister of John Henry and
Claudia, wants to retrieve her father's body, cremate it and sprinkle
his ashes off Florida's coast, as Williams' will dictates.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is almost certain to be settled by a judge.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Thursday, John Henry and Claudia Williams said:
"With relief we have provided the court with clear-cut, definitive
evidence that our father's last wishes have been carried out and we
hope this will bring closure to this issue."</TE>
<TE>   The note has several small dark stains, apparently oil or grease.
Goldman said John Henry Williams had folded the note and left it in
some files in the trunk of his car for an extended time.</TE>
<TE>   One of Ferrell's attorneys, Richard Fitzpatrick, said that if the
note is the only evidence John Henry and Claudia Williams can muster
supporting their case, then Ferrell would win the court fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We will certainly want to fully investigate the circumstances
surrounding this document," he said.</TE>

<HD>Kuerten Avoids a Close Shave</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Newly shorn Brazilian is in good form during, after
straight-set win over Lee; Agassi tops Ginepri in 54 minutes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honesty and charm were his best one-two combination, though his serve
certainly should not be overlooked, either, after a straight-set
victory at the Mercedes-Benz Cup on Thursday at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   The straight talk coming from fifth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of
Brazil was refreshing when he was asked about the upcoming U.S. Open.
What, exactly, would it take to reach the final?</LD>
<LD>   "I don't see myself as a good chance to get to the final," Kuerten
said. "It's not a long time to get my power and feeling to win, not
knowing how my body will respond. It'll be the first time [playing]
five sets [in months]."</LD>
<TE>   And the impish charm emerged when he was asked about his new short
haircut. His life has changed now that his brother's family recently
expanded.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I'm uncle. I have to look like a normal guy," he said,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   The children aren't named after him. But why not call one of them
Guga?</TE>
<TE>   "They would be upset," Kuerten said.</TE>
<TE>   If it doesn't seem like there is much pressure on Kuerten--he
rarely shows the stress, anyway--it is because there are few
expectations for him for the summer hard-court season. This is his
first hard-court tournament since the Australian Open in January, and
his 7-5, 7-6 (5) victory against Martin Lee of Britain was only his
second match on this surface since then.</TE>
<TE>   Hip surgery in February sidelined him until shortly before the
French Open, and the three-time champion made a spirited showing,
reaching the fourth round before losing to eventual champion Albert
Costa.</TE>
<TE>   Against Lee, Kuerten had 12 aces and did not double fault in the
second-round match. Additionally, he managed to keep his composure
and focus after a 30-minute delay in the second set. Play was
interrupted with Kuerten serving at 2-3, 15-0, when a fan collapsed
in the south grandstand and went into convulsions.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament officials said the spectator was a 41-year-old male
from Canoga Park, according to his identification. They said he was
taken to the emergency room at UCLA Medical Center and reported to be
stable and alert.</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten and Lee stayed on the court during the delay and had a
brief warmup before resuming. The Brazilian player later said the
interruption did not bother him.</TE>
<TE>   The victory put Kuerten into tonight's quarterfinal against the
defending champion, No. 2-seeded Andre Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi had little trouble in his second-round match, defeating
19-year-old Robby Ginepri, 6-3, 6-1, in 54 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Also advancing were Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, who defeated
qualifier Alex Bogomolov Jr., 6-3, 6-3, and Jan-Michael Gambill, who
beat Noam Okun of Israel, 7-6 (2), 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Bogomolov had the biggest victory of his young career Tuesday
night, defeating Tommy Haas of Germany in the first round. Kiefer
joked that he had to fight back for his country.</TE>
<TE>   Kiefer and Gambill will play the first quarterfinal today. The
Agassi-Kuerten quarterfinal, a rematch of last year's semifinal here,
is the featured night match. Agassi leads their series, 6-4, and won
the 2001 semifinal, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3, in one of the best matches of
the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's going to be a pleasure again," Kuerten said. "I
haven't played a semifinal this year. If I play Andre, I'm not sure I
can play the same way I did last year. Even though I lost, it was one
of my best matches."</TE>
<TE>   Even under the best circumstances, Agassi is a legitimate test.
Ginepri, who reached the semifinals on grass at Newport, R.I.,
earlier this month, was overmatched against Agassi's power and
accuracy. Agassi won the first set in 33 minutes and raised his level
another notch in the second, losing only five points on his serve.</TE>
<TE>   "He got at me right from the go," Ginepri said. "I didn't put in
as many returns as I wanted to.... He hits the ball so deep and
consistent."</TE>
<TE>   For Agassi, the only disappointment is that the Kuerten match is
in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be great and we haven't played in a year now,"
Agassi said. "It's always explosive when we play and we always look
to control the point and be the aggressor and we've had so many great
matches. I expect a real colorful one tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   "Too bad it's early in the tournament."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attendance Thursday was 6,427 for the day session, 7,062 for the
night session, the most through the first four days of the event.</TE>

<HD>Only Disaster Could Derail Armstrong Victory Parade</HD>
<DH>Tour de France: Texan maintains nearly insurmountable lead
he built in mountain stages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CLUSES, France</DL>
<LD>He won't say it, because he doesn't have to.</LD>
<LD>   Lance Armstrong essentially clinched his fourth Tour de France a
week ago in the Pyrenees, following the template he has traced in
previous Tours with explosive back-to-back climbs during stages 11
and 12 on La Mongie and Plateau de Beille.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong, whose advantage over Spain's Joseba Beloki was 2
minutes 28 seconds after Plateau de Beille, has more than doubled it
since to 5 minutes 6 seconds and has only to stay upright to win this
stepping stone of a 2002 Tour.</LD>
<TE>   If he isn't tripped before Sunday's laps on the Champs-Elysees,
the 30-year-old Texan, a testicular cancer survivor, will become the
fifth man to have won at least four Tours. As befits an athlete whose
story always has been backlit by unusual drama, Armstrong would bid
for his record-tying fifth Tour title next year during the race's
centennial edition, slated to begin and end in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The waning days of this Tour--even along the most picturesque and
historic raceway in the Alps--have felt a little like pages ripped
from a wall calendar, the faces of stage winners flipping by with
little import on the race. Dario Frigo, the Italian Tacconi team
rider whose baby face was sullied in last year's Tour of Italy drug
scandal, was Thursday's pin-up, taking the rolling, 88-mile Stage 17
from Aime to Cluses in the final sprint.</TE>
<TE>   The lone exception was the fearsome Mont Ventoux stage Sunday in
Provence, a stage Armstrong would have liked to win. He also figures
to ride fully loaded in Saturday's individual time trial in the
Beaujolais wine country, having lost the Tour's previous time trial
to Colombian Santiago Botero.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong's final margin may not be far from his other three Tour
victories, in which the average gap was just under seven minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet his distance from the field seems wider. In the absence of
Germany's Jan Ullrich, a prospective challenge from tandems on two
Spanish teams-- Beloki and Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano of ONCE, Botero
and Oscar Sevilla from Kelme--never materialized despite Armstrong's
efforts to talk it up.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez de Galdeano did wear the yellow jersey for six days and
Botero won two stages. But Beloki, third to Armstrong the last two
years, was firmly pinned every time he attempted to wrestle Armstrong
in the mountains, and Botero couldn't string together enough good
days to constitute a true threat. Sevilla dropped out of the race
this week due to illness.</TE>
<TE>   Beloki candidly conceded the race after Ventoux.</TE>
<TE>   Just as significant as the quality of his rivals is the strength
and consistency of Armstrong's current U.S. Postal Service team.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Tour rookie Floyd Landis, who never seemed
to recover from his struggles in the Pyrenees, and Benoit Joachim,
who has been somewhat invisible, Armstrong's supporting cast has been
Oscar-worthy.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Heras redeemed his subpar 2001 Tour with the eye-popping
tractor-beam ride that helped tow Armstrong up La Mongie. Jose Luis
Rubiera has been a metronome on the pedals. George Hincapie, best
known for his ability in the flats, has been surprisingly strong in
the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Barring accident, Heras and Rubiera are certain to finish in the
top 25, although Postal has not managed to find a way to get Heras a
stage bouquet that would have been an ideal symbolic thank-you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Highlights from the 17th stage on Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   Stage: An 88-mile stretch from Aime to Cluses, featuring four
tough climbs. It was the last mountain stage of the Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Italy's Dario Frigo, in 4 hours, 2 minutes, 27 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   How Others Fared: Three-time champion Lance Armstrong retained the
overall leader's yellow jersey despite finishing the stage in 24th
place, 4:36 behind Frigo. Armstrong's lead over his nearest rival,
Spain's Joseba Beloki, was unchanged at 5:06.</TE>
<TE>   Quote Of The Day: "I sleep pretty good at night with the lead that
we have," said Armstrong of his overall lead, which should see him
take a fourth consecutive title on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Next Stage: A hilly 109.4-mile trek from Cluses to
Bourg-en-Bresse.</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Getting Out-Foxed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers are fading, the Angels are red hot, and both have a big
series on the road this weekend. But while all three of the Dodgers'
games at San Francisco will be on television, only two of the Angels'
three games at Seattle will be televised.</LD>
<LD>   Channel 9 has the games tonight and Sunday afternoon. Saturday's
game is not televised because of Fox's exclusivity. Saturday's
Dodger-Giant game has been on Fox's schedule since the beginning of
the season.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers and Giants were also on Fox last Saturday. The game
was one of four regional telecasts and it helped Fox get a 3.7
national rating, its highest for regular-season baseball in two
years.</LD>
<TE>   However, a lot has changed in a week. An argument could be made
that there is now more interest in the Angels and Mariners,
considering the Dodgers' recent dismal play.</TE>
<TE>   This still may be a Dodger town. But the Angels, who swept the
Mariners last weekend and then took two of three from Oakland, are
gaining ground.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger telecasts on Channel 13 are averaging a 3.1 rating, which
is a 15% increase over last year's 2.7. Angel telecasts on Channel 9
are averaging a 2.2, but that's a 47% increase over last year's 1.5.</TE>
<TE>   All this Angelmania has put the team's TV announcers, Steve
Physioc and Rex Hudler, in the spotlight. They work the telecasts on
both Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net. After Sunday, Fox Sports Net has
the Angels six nights in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are winning over a lot of fans, and first-time viewers
will discover that Hudler is a little different. He's somewhere on
the other end of the spectrum from Vin Scully.</TE>
<TE>   The erudite Scully is an orator with a soothing delivery. Hudler,
wound tighter than a juiced-up baseball, is sort of another version
of Bill Walton, bubbling with enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Walton is never one to understate anything. Neither is Hudler.</TE>
<TE>   On the air, Hudler actually seems to reel himself in. But the
passion is still there, and that passion sometimes results in
homerism. In a market as sophisticated as Los Angeles, that is not a
good thing.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Hudler isn't afraid to criticize the Angels
when it's appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   The good and bad of Hudler came through on one play in the bottom
of the ninth inning of the Angels' 2-1 loss Tuesday night to Oakland,
when the Angels' Adam Kennedy, leading off, popped up to shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "Aw," sighed Hudler, showing some inappropriate homerism.</TE>
<TE>   But after shortstop Miguel Tejada dropped the high pop-up, Hudler
appropriately criticized Kennedy, who had gone only as far as first
base when he could have easily reached second.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't hustling, and that's a mistake on his part," Hudler
said. "You always have to run it out."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy was running harder the next night, even sliding into first
base.</TE>
<TE>   Hudler, 41, knows about running them out. His hustle enabled him
to play professional baseball for 21 seasons. He spent 10 years in
the minors, running through more cities than the Mississippi River.
He played for 18 minor league teams.</TE>
<TE>   He made it to the major leagues with Montreal in 1988, spent three
seasons as a utility player with the Angels (1994-96) and finished up
with Philadelphia in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the 1999 season, the Angels restructured their TV
announcing teams and wanted one commentator for both Channel 9 and
Fox Sports Net. Tim Mead, now the team's director of communications,
suggested Hudler, mainly because of his infectious personality. It
certainly wasn't because of his broadcasting experience, because he
didn't have any.</TE>
<TE>   In Hudler's first season announcing, the team lost 104 games, and
his upbeat style seemed out of place. But Physioc liked having him
around.</TE>
<TE>   "He made it fun to come to work even though the team was losing,"
Physioc said. "He's the kind of guy you look forward to seeing every
day. No matter what kind of mood you're in, he's going to make you
feel better because he's in a good mood every day of the week."</TE>
<TE>   Spend some time with Hudler and you can't help but like the guy.
You just wonder if he's for real. Can anybody be that upbeat all the
time?</TE>
<TE>   "He's genuine, there's no question about that," Mead said. "If he
has a fault it's that he can't say no to anyone. But that's not
really a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Macdonald, who hosts Fox Sports Net's Angel pregame shows
with Hudler, said, "What you see is what you get. He's got passion,
intensity and humor."</TE>
<TE>   Don Corsini, the general manager at both Channel 9 and new sister
station Channel 2, said, "He makes me laugh and he's entertaining. He
brings a fresh perspective and I enjoy listening to him."</TE>
<TE>   Off the air, Hudler talks continuously. Before Tuesday's game, he
talked about his days as a multi-sport star at Bullard High in
Fresno. He talked about meeting his wife, Jennifer, in Columbus,
Ohio, during his 10th season in the minors. He talked about their
three children and said a fourth is on the way.</TE>
<TE>   His son Cade, 5, has Down's syndrome. Hudler calls it Up syndrome
because he is not down about anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I love people and I love attention," he said. "Playing baseball
got me a lot of attention. What I'm doing now still gets me a lot of
attention, and I love it."</TE>
<TE>   And the way the Angels are going, he's going to get even more
attention.</TE>
<TE>   NBA News</TE>
<TE>   Charles Barkley has signed a multiyear contract to remain with
TNT. His new deal calls for an expanded role within AOL Time Warner,
including weekly appearances on CNN's daily "TalkBack Live" with
Arthel Neville</TE>
<TE>   Walton was on a conference call with reporters Thursday, when he
and Brad Nessler were named the NBA's lead announcing team for ABC
and ESPN. The No. 2 team will be Mike Tirico and Tom Tolbert....</TE>
<TE>   ABC President Howard Katz, when asked about Brent Musburger, said
he expected him to have some kind of role.... There has been talk
that ESPN is interested in Dan Majerle, but ESPN Executive Vice
President Steve Anderson said, "He's not sure how serious he is about
being a part of the business."</TE>
<TE>   Something different this season, besides games being on ABC and
ESPN as part of a six-year agreement, will be the blackout policies.
TNT, because of its 18-year relationship with the NBA, is being given
more exclusivity.</TE>
<TE>   TNT will have six of its nine Laker telecasts to itself, including
the season opener against San Antonio at Staples Center on Oct. 29.
That game will not be televised by Fox Sports Net. The NBA was able
to give TNT exclusivity because ABC is televising only 14 or 15
regular-season games. The Lakers had 11 exclusive appearances on NBC
last season. They'll have four on ABC and six on TNT this season.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Chris Madsen, who has been the Mighty Ducks' TV announcer since
the team's inception in 1993, will not return this season. The team
gave no reason for not renewing Madsen's contract.... ESPN has
finally announced that it has hired Kevin Frazier, formerly of Fox
Sports Net. Frazier makes his debut as a "SportsCenter" anchor
tonight at 10. He will also be an NBA studio host....</TE>
<TE>   Good news for horse racing fans: For the first time since 1997,
there is a daily show from Del Mar. Fox Sports Net 2 is carrying
TVG's "Trackside Live" from Del Mar daily from 4-6 p.m. and 6-8 p.m.
Fridays</TE>
<TE>   During Sunday's coverage of the ATP Mercedes-Benz Cup on Fox
Sports Net, there will be a short tribute to legendary film director
and avid tennis fan John Frankenheimer, who died July 6. Freelance
tennis producer Harold Hecht, a close friend, put together the
tribute.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Push for Promised Afghan Aid</HD>
<DH>Relief: World donors have yet to release most of the $4.5
billion pledged. Officials say tangible improvements are key to
stability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell pledged Thursday to speed up
delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Afghanistan after
much of the new Afghan Cabinet said long-suffering people were
waiting for the world to make good on its promises of help.</LD>
<LD>   "Afghan expectations were raised, and we hope [international
donors] will hold up their words," said Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S.
special envoy to Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   So far, $660 million of the $4.5 billion in promised international
aid has been disbursed, said Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah. But
most of that has been emergency humanitarian aid. Very little
reconstruction aid has arrived, he said.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. and Afghan officials agreed that the Afghan people need to
see tangible improvements in their daily lives in order to keep
political and economic reforms moving forward, and to prevent
remnants of the deposed Taliban regime and the Al Qaeda terrorist
network from finding sympathetic soil on which to regroup.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said the U.S. is "working hard to make sure that all those
who have made commitments to the reconstruction effort in the
international community make good in their commitment and send it as
soon as possible because the need is great."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has already sent about $400 million in aid to
Afghanistan, well above the $296.7 million it pledged in January at a
conference of international donors in Tokyo, officials of the U.S.
Agency for International Development said. Some of the money went to
the World Food Program to stave off famine that loomed recently,
while other funds were used to resettle about 1.2 million refugees
who have streamed home.</TE>
<TE>   A massive program to send hundreds of thousands of Afghan children
back to school in March, many with textbooks and some with school
lunches, was hailed as a success.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the money pledged in Tokyo, including from some Middle
Eastern countries and some European Union programs, has yet to
materialize.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Afghans look at the huge numbers pledged in Tokyo, they
envisioned kilometer after kilometer of paved roads," said one USAID
official.</TE>
<TE>   People have high expectations for Hamid Karzai, their first
democratically chosen president, Afghan officials said. Yet a large
percentage of the population is surviving on foreign food aid, only
20% have access to clean water, and many of the students who will
enter Kabul University next fall are homeless orphans.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys have a political problem on their hands, and if people
don't see a visible peace dividend, it puts pressure on the
government," the U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said the Afghan government is becoming more effective,
which "makes it easier for us to deliver aid."</TE>
<TE>   But the government will have to show progress in tackling the
continuing instability and violence. Aid workers have been attacked,
and warlords who helped the U.S. oust Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters
are now a hindrance to reconstruction, said Roberta Cohen, a
specialist in humanitarian issues at the Brookings Institution. The
U.S. has rejected Karzai's request to expand the U.S. security
presence to the Afghan countryside, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to get economic development if roads aren't
secured, if there's banditry and lawlessness, if warlords are running
everything, if it's corrupt and if you've got to pay them off," Cohen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Until April, Karzai's government did not have a bank account into
which donors could deposit funds, let alone procedures for accounting
for the aid.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has promised a Marshall Plan-style program to
rebuild Afghanistan. Officials said the administration is well aware
that America's reputation is at stake. But the bureaucracies that
help pour concrete for roads and schools are far slower than the
agencies that deliver emergency food aid, Cohen said. "Between the
promise and the arrival is such a long time that it undermines
political stability," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Six members of the Afghan Cabinet were in Washington for a summit
sponsored by Georgetown University. While each stressed the dire
conditions at home, many cited some successes.</TE>
<TE>   Habiba Sarabi, the newly named minister of women's affairs,
outlined new programs to help Afghan women learn English and computer
skills, open clinics to address maternal and child health, and
provide literacy and job training for war widows. She noted that the
ministry has even succeeded in opening a women's center in Kandahar,
former stronghold of the Taliban.</TE>

<HD>49 Suspected Drug Smugglers Arrested</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colombian and U.S. authorities said they arrested 49 people in four
countries, including 12 in the United States, smashing an
international ring that smuggled $8.1 million worth of cocaine and
heroin into the United States and Europe every month.</LD>
<LD>   The ring, which operated from the northwestern Colombian city of
Medellin, sent 440 pounds of cocaine and 22 pounds of heroin per

<HD>Lawmakers Call for New Iran Regime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A bipartisan group of lawmakers said Thursday that they want Congress
to go on record calling for a new regime in Iran, which they said
presents an equal or greater threat than Iraq. "In the global war on
the cancer of terrorism, our next strategic, surgical focus needs to
be Iran," said Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), who will push a
resolution calling for a new Iranian government along with Sen. Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo).</LD>
<LD>   The lawmakers said their resolution mirrored a shift in President
Bush's policy toward the Islamic Republic to increasingly reach out
directly to the Iranian people seeking reforms and bypass the
government of President Mohammad Khatami.</LD>
<LD>   While the Bush administration has focused on Iraq and threatened
military action to topple President Saddam Hussein, the lawmakers
said Iran must be kept in mind because it is expected to have nuclear
weapons in three to five years.</LD>
<TE>   The lawmakers said the resolution did not call for U.S. military
action against the current Iranian government.</TE>
<TE>   The draft of the resolution, which has not yet been introduced,
says that "positive gestures" should be directed toward the Iranian
people "and not political figures whose survival depends upon
preservation of the current regime."</TE>
<TE>   It said U.S. policy should be "to seek a genuine democratic
government in Iran that will restore freedom to the Iranian people,
abandon terrorism, and live in peace and security with the
international community."</TE>
<TE>   The administration has accused Iran of developing weapons of mass
destruction and of sheltering Al Qaeda fighters who fled Afghanistan.</TE>

<LD>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, a missile scientist who advocates nuclear weapons
as a war deterrent, was sworn in as India's president Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In his acceptance speech, Kalam said India should brace itself to
face the growing threats posed by terrorism, internal conflicts and
unemployment.</LD>
<LD>   Kalam was elected July 18. Both the Hindu nationalist-led
governing coalition and the major opposition Congress Party had
backed the 70-year-old military scientist, who has embraced the Hindu
beliefs of India's majority even though he is a Muslim by birth.</LD>
<TE>   He was part of the team that conducted five underground nuclear
tests in May 1998 that triggered global criticism, economic sanctions
and matching tests by neighboring Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his ceremonial post, the president can play a crucial
role. He can call elections or choose a party to form a government.</TE>

<HD>Frustrated by Deadlock, Iranians Seek New Voice</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Citing a lack of progress on reforms, many embrace
a citizens rights movement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>The young police officer charged into the crowd, his knuckles white
from gripping the long barrel of a tear gas gun he didn't want to
fire. His shouts were lost in the din, so he hollered louder until he
could be heard: "Please, please, brothers and sisters, leave here!
Leave here now!"</LD>
<LD>   But no one left.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, more and more people poured into the streets around
Tehran University, defying a government ban, to mark the third
anniversary of student demonstrations that were violently crushed by
police. And it wasn't just students this time around. It was elderly
women with their black chadors pulled tight. The disabled on
crutches. A boy on a bicycle.</LD>
<TE>   "We aren't afraid," the boy said. "They can't frighten us."</TE>
<TE>   This is the Islamic Republic of Iran that the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini left behind, a land divided, snagged in the struggle for the
soul of a nation. Hard-liners and conservatives, radicals and
reformers continue playing out a now decades-old fight for dominance,
with neither side victorious.</TE>
<TE>   But the chasm between the camps has narrowed as public consensus
forms around some broad ideas: the need for government accountability
and for citizens rights, to name two.</TE>
<TE>   And behind that consensus there is talk of a new force emerging.
The Iranians call it the ''Third  Force,'' a movement that
encompasses almost everyone who is not in power.</TE>
<TE>   It is a social force, a political force. Religious groups, reform
groups, radicals and conservatives alike are claiming title to this
emerging power. The Third Force appears to cover everyone who is
disgusted and disaffected, which, judging from the crowd outside
Tehran University, cuts a wide swath across the social, political and
economic strata of Iranian society.</TE>
<TE>   It is easier to say what the Third Force is against: It is against
the hard-liners who rule the country by decree, elevating themselves
above the law by controlling the police, the military and the courts.
It is against a dynamic that emphasizes politics over policy, and it
condemns everyone in power, the right and the left, for failing to
combat the social, political and economic turmoil that drags Iran
down as a nation and makes daily life difficult for its people.</TE>
<TE>   On these points, almost everyone agrees--hard-liners excluded.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the Third Force is a political trend in our
country," said Taha Hashemi, a moderate conservative who wears
religious robes and edits a daily newspaper. "They are criticizing
the actions of the political parties. They are saying the parties
were not successful."</TE>
<TE>   Hamid Reza Jalaeipour is an influential reformist and eternal
optimist who sees his nation moving toward democracy. "The Third
Force is the youth that are disappointed," he said, referring to the
65% of the population that is 25 or younger. "In some aspects, I am
speaking for the Third Force too."</TE>
<TE>   The dissatisfaction has reached into the heart of the reform
movement, which people had hoped would open the economy and promote
freedom of expression. Its largest faction, the Islamic Iran
Participation Front, has threatened to quit the government and
parliament--a move, if taken, that would allow it to claim membership
in the Third Force too.</TE>
<TE>   "If they [hard-liners] stall reforms, then only two ... choices
remain: dictatorship or uprising," Mohammad Reza Khatami, the brother
of President Mohammad Khatami and leader of the Participation Front,
said in a speech last week.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, little has changed in Iran since Mohammad Khatami
was elected in a landslide last year to a second term. The social
reforms that Khatami pressed for in his first years in office, such
as the easing of restrictions on relations between young men and
women, are still in place, and in some cases have advanced.</TE>
<TE>   And as during his first years in office, his agenda and his
supporters are harassed and intimidated by the security apparatus.
Newspapers are shut down, journalists jailed, reform politicians
arrested and jailed.</TE>
<TE>   The push and pull between the Iranian masses and the self-anointed
religious leadership is most evident in the streets, where men and
women are constantly challenging the bounds of what is considered
acceptable--while the morality police try to push back.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep your hejab [modest Islamic dress] proper!" a police officer
shouted over a loudspeaker above his cruiser as he patrolled in front
of the Golastan Shopping Center in west Tehran one recent evening.
"Keep your hejab proper!"</TE>
<TE>   Plainclothes police with walkie-talkies and handcuffs on their
belts patrolled through the crowd outside, frightening women with a
glance.</TE>
<TE>   But inside, in the shops, window after window was filled with a
defiant theme: red. Red women's clothing and accessories. Even the
religious garb intended to guard female modesty was red, not the
black that religious authorities prefer.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the shah's secular regime, women wore the black
chador as a show of political defiance. Today, they wear red.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem selling red shoes, red pants, red blouses, red
bags," said Mehran Mohammadi, 28, the owner of a small boutique. "If
they [the vice police] want to do something, they will go after the
person wearing it."</TE>
<TE>   But he does not sell many of the loose-fitting shirts women must
wear over their other clothes, known as a rapouje, in red. "They
don't feel free enough," he said of his female customers.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion may be the most visible manifestation of Iran's turmoil,
but it is in some ways the most superficial. The major struggle, the
one pulling at the fabric of the Islamic Republic, bears directly on
the two-tiered system set up by Khomeini: the secular and religious
institutions, with the latter having final say over everything.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners control the religious establishment but appear
increasingly isolated and unpopular. They are loath to relinquish
power. Yet there is a growing chorus for creating civil institutions,
elected by and responsible to the public.</TE>
<TE>   More fundamentally, there is growing opposition to the concept of
velayet faghih--an ideological cornerstone of the republic that gives
the supreme leader religious as well as political ascendancy. It
effectively places him and his religious institutions above the law.</TE>
<TE>   The concept was broadly supported in the early days of the
republic when Khomeini, a larger-than-life figure, played the role of
the faghih, or supreme jurist. The current supreme leader, the
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, does not command the same regard as his
predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   "The desire for the Iranian people is for freedom, human rights
and justice," said Heshmatola Tabarzadi, 43, a radical opposition
leader who has been jailed many times for his political activities.
"But those in power are against the people. The situation in Iran
today has changed dramatically. At the start of the revolution, 90%
of the people supported Ayatollah Khomeini. Today, 90% are against
Mr. Khamenei. That is the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Fariborz Raisdana, a social pathologist and leftist political
activist, said that from his perspective, the public wants to see a
separation of church and state, a principle that he thinks is at the
core of the Third Force. "We want to see our problems solved not with
anti-Islamic policies but with non-Islamic policies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible to know in a society such as Iran's exactly what
the masses are thinking. But the political leadership--and to some
extent, the hard-line leadership--does react to public pressure. So
it is telling that Khatami and his reformers aren't alone in calling
for creation of civil institutions. So are supporters of hard-liners.
The conservative newspaper Resaalat recently called for all factions
to work together.</TE>
<TE>   "The reform movement has been unable to satisfy the young people
and the secularists, but it has captured the conservative young
people," reformist Jalaeipour said.</TE>
<TE>   There are even some signs that the hard-liners are moving, ever so
slightly, under the weight of public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Key opposition leaders have not been jailed. Workers have formed
trade unions, students are mobilizing, and thousands of
nongovernmental organizations have opened in the last few
years--groups that take on everything from rampant prostitution in
the capital to the devastating air pollution that also plagues the
city.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the recent resignation of the Ayatollah
Jalaluddin Taheri, a senior cleric and Friday prayer leader in the
central Iranian city of Isfahan, who complained about "deception,
unemployment, inflation, the diabolical gap between the rich and
poor, bribery, cheating, growing drug consumption, the incompetence
of authorities and the failure of the political structure."</TE>
<TE>   What was even more surprising was that although the hard-liners
banned the media from reporting reaction to the resignation, and
cautioned that such actions could empower Iran's enemies, Khamenei
said that he too shared concerns over corruption and poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now at what I call a standstill," said Ibrahim Yazdi, an
opposition leader and founder of the Freedom Movement. "No one can
move forward; no one can move backward. Each has tried to eliminate
the other. They have failed."</TE>
<TE>   Iranians are patient people, or at least their political leaders
are. Opposition leaders say that after centuries of despotic rule,
change will come but must by necessity come slowly. Unlike the
revolution that unseated the shah, they say, it is a civic movement
that will, eventually, sweep the hard-liners away.</TE>
<TE>   And if that is to happen, observers say, it will be because of the
Third Force.</TE>
<TE>   "In 45 years, I have not seen this kind of movement," said
Raisdana, the activist. "Twenty-five years ago, you would never find
Muslim students in favor of separation of church and state. Today,
many people support that.... Disappointment is good, because it will
lead people to political action."</TE>
<TE>   Still, that remains the optimistic view. The hard-liners,
operating in a vacuum of public support, have shown no willingness to
cede their unchecked authority--a reality that opposition leaders say
will have to change if the country is to avoid slipping into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   In a fashionable Tehran neighborhood, a cultural center recently
opened where young people flocked to watch movies, discuss
literature, learn to paint.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-liners shut it down. They didn't give any reason--and
they didn't have to. "They are afraid," said a supporter of the
center.</TE>
<TE>   "They are afraid of anyplace that brings people together."</TE>

<HD>No Decision on Iraq Imminent, Blair Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Facing strong domestic opposition to possible military action against
Iraq, British Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed Thursday that no
decision on an attack was imminent. But he refused to promise to seek
Parliament's approval in case of any plan to strike.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we are getting ahead of ourselves on the issue of Iraq,"
Blair told reporters at a televised news conference. "We're not at
the point of decision." But, he added, "I'm not going to commit
myself to any particular form of consultation."</LD>
<LD>   In the House of Commons on Wednesday, legislators asked the prime
minister to promise to recall Parliament from its summer break if he
planned to commit British forces to action in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   "We have not got to the stage of military action," Blair replied.
"If we do get to that stage at any point in time, we will, of course,
make sure that Parliament is properly consulted."</TE>
<TE>   But he refused to say what form that consultation would take.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, decisions about military action are made by the
prime minister after consultation with the Cabinet, and Parliament is
usually given a chance to debate, if not to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Blair, a strong U.S. ally, has said he believes that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, in
addition to his chemical and biological ones.</TE>
<TE>   Blair said in a recent magazine interview that if the time came
for action against Iraq, "people will have the evidence presented to
them" to show that Hussein "is trying to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, in particular a nuclear capability."</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister repeated demands for Hussein to readmit United
Nations weapons inspectors -- "unconditionally, any time, anywhere,
anyplace."</TE>

<HD>Mexican Town's Fishing Oasis Parched by Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DON MARTIN, Mexico</DL>
<LD>It was a surreal creation. For three generations, a fisherman's oasis
thrived in the Chihuahuan desert here, preserved only by some
switches in a control room atop a 290-foot-tall dam.</LD>
<LD>   The dam went up in 1930 to pool the Rio Salado's water for new
cotton fields and two nearby towns. But the reservoir also filled up
with trout, bream, bass, catfish and carp, giving rise to a village
of 80 fishing families, a marina and six restaurants for visiting
anglers.</LD>
<LD>   Then, last year, the dam's federal custodian flipped the switches,
sending billions of gallons of water rushing toward the Rio Grande to
ease a deficit in Mexico's booming border cities and South Texas'
parched farms. Infuriated, the villagers rallied behind Adrian
Guajardo and seized the control room. They stemmed the flow for 72
days but ultimately lost the battle.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the village's concrete boat ramp ends abruptly on a rocky,
cactus-studded plain several hundred yards short of the receding
waterline. Four-fifths of a man-made lake that once covered 27 square
miles is gone, along with a livelihood the fishermen took for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   As the Rio Grande basin endures its worst drought in nearly half a
century, perhaps no community has fought so hard for its water or
lost so much so suddenly as Don Martin. Its decline is a lesson about
the limits to survival in the world's arid regions, where rising
populations fight over a shrinking source of life.</TE>
<TE>   The village's struggle is also a sign of rising local militancy
over water in northern Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's government, committed under President Vicente Fox to
democracy and openness, is facing challenges to its centuries-old
habit of making water policy by decree. Protests over water transfers
have erupted in other Mexican cities and rural communities during the
last year, drawing Congress and the courts into disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The protests have complicated relations with the United States by
making it harder for Mexico to comply with a 1944 treaty obligation
to share the flows of its Rio Grande tributaries with its northern
neighbor. Mexico is 450 billion gallons behind on deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Don Martin--68 miles west of Laredo, Texas, in Mexico's Coahuila
state--is devoutly Roman Catholic. Many here viewed the reservoir as
a gift from God and trusted the natural cycle of evaporation and rain
to keep it productive.</TE>
<TE>   "We survived before, when it was God who took our water.... He
always evened things up by sending us rain," said Guajardo, 30, a
fisherman's son who owns a restaurant here. "This time the water was
taken by the will of man, and now people fear that God is angry and
will not hear our prayers."</TE>
<TE>   In recent conversations at their fishing co-op, other villagers
said their lost battle has driven home a painful truth: The water was
never really theirs. In fact, water in Mexico is controlled by the
federal government. With no plan for managing the country's many
reservoirs, it moves water around haphazardly, depending on need and
political influence.</TE>
<TE>   While Texas farmers collect U.S. crop insurance to offset losses,
drought-stricken Mexicans collect promises from their government--but
little relief. As their settlements dry up, they leave like nomads in
search of water.</TE>
<TE>   "Our village is disappearing little by little," said Pedro
Tijerina, a 50-year-old fisherman, speaking over the sound of wind
chimes on his back patio. He estimates that 35 young men, one-tenth
of Don Martin's population, have migrated to border cities or the
United States since their deep blue-green water flowed away.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell President Bush that if he takes any more of our water, we'll
see him next year in Texas," added Tijerina's wife, Maria Jesus
Ledezma.</TE>
<TE>   Each evening, Don Martin's remaining fishermen leave modest
concrete-block homes and walk over what used to be the rocky lakebed
to little boats moored in the shallow, silt-laden water. They row or
push out on foot for more than a mile before the reservoir gets deep
enough to lay their nets. Even then it is rarely 10 feet to the
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   They venture out again in the morning to haul the nets in. Few
bother to start their engines, figuring that the meager catches
awaiting them won't bring enough money to pay for the fuel.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical day recently, Tijerina brought home two carp, 2
pounds each. His wife filleted and froze them. It used to take the
couple a week to fill their big freezer with fish that fetched about
$200 from visiting wholesale buyers. Now it takes more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Some villagers can no longer afford to keep their freezers plugged
in. They eat their catch instead of selling it.</TE>
<TE>   Community life is under strain. Six of the 30 players on Don
Martin's youth baseball team, the Colts, have quit because their
tennis shoes wore out and their parents couldn't buy new ones.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurants have lost their best clients, the sports fishermen
who once drove here from Monterrey, Saltillo and Nuevo Laredo.</TE>
<TE>   Such hardship has been common for years across the Rio Grande
basin. Rainfall has dwindled by half over the last decade while the
population has soared beyond 20 million. Cattle have died and crops
have withered across northern Mexico and southern Texas. Border
cities, swollen by freer U.S.-Mexico trade and the lure of new
assembly plants on the Mexican side, are short of drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   In that environment, the little village's big reservoir--its
pelicans and ducks, its fishing and tourist income--was too good to
last.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican authorities announced in December 2000 that they would
open the dam's four floodgates to replenish drinking water reserves
for more than a million people of the lower Rio Grande.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Don Martin's inhabitants were willing to let the water
go if they could save their fish. They blocked the catwalk to the
dam's control room for 20 days until federal authorities agreed to
place a net across the gates.</TE>
<TE>   But on Jan. 4, the gates opened without a net, and the dispute got
ugly. Nearly everyone in the village, joined by their congressman,
stormed the dam. They pushed aside Juan Lopez, the custodian, evaded
his three growling dogs, and sawed off the control room's lock. Lopez
cut off power to the switches, but the villagers worked all night to
close the gates manually, using four large wheels that lowered them
by one centimeter for each 120 laborious turns.</TE>
<TE>   Ledezma, a 44-year-old mother of five who had never committed a
crime in her life, said she was trembling. "We were breaking federal
law, intruding on federal property," she said. "But we told ourselves
that if Mexico is supposed to be a democracy they can't stop us from
defending our livelihood."</TE>
<TE>   The authorities pleaded with them at first, then got tough. In
February 2001, Fox met Bush for the first time and agreed, without
public discussion, to send much of Don Martin's water north--not only
to Mexican border cities, but also to Texas in partial payment of
Mexico's water debt.</TE>
<TE>   The dam was to be opened long enough to release 57 billion
gallons.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to the village and told them that, they wanted to
feed me to the fish," said Salomon Abedrop, director of the state
water commission.</TE>
<TE>   The 72-day seizure of the dam ended in March with a negotiated
pact in Mexico City, achieved with a mixture of federal promises of
aid and threats of arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Little of the aid has materialized, and almost no rain has fallen
to replenish the reservoir. A net went up, but its mesh was too wide
to keep smaller fish from flowing through the open dam. Fish eggs
were left on shore as the water receded. The government offered, then
failed to restock fish in what remained of the reservoir after the
dam closed in May.</TE>
<TE>   Don Martin got a water purification plant, but promised loans for
new boats and business ventures have yet to materialize. Ledezma and
14 other women are still waiting for machines and cloth to help them
launch a sewing co-op.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the village uprising helped change Mexico's political
climate. Water has become a more politically charged issue over the
last year, turning the Coahuila state government into a
self-professed champion of local drought victims against the whims of
federal power.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Martinez, the governor, first sided with Fox in the
dispute here; his emissaries helped persuade Don Martin's residents
to end their seizure of the dam.</TE>
<TE>   In recent interviews, however, Martinez and his aides said that
what happened to the fishing village was a disgrace. They are
demanding that Fox explain his government's water accords with
Washington and complete millions of dollars in water conservation
works before letting any more of the resource leave the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Water is a federal matter," the governor said. "But if you don't
take into account the views of the states and the citizens of the
states, then you're going to meet resistance.... How are you going to
transfer water if hundreds of people are standing in front of a dam?
The people won't allow it, and their governor will support them."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea 'Regrets' Skirmish at Sea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>North Korea expressed regret Thursday for a naval battle last month
that killed at least four South Korean sailors, and it offered to
renew working-level talks aimed at improving relations between the
wary neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   The Communist regime in Pyongyang, however, stopped short of
accepting blame for the clash, which occurred in disputed,
seafood-rich waters of the Yellow Sea. The fight prompted Washington
to withdraw its offer for high-level meetings with the North.</LD>
<LD>   "We regret the accidental armed clash which happened a short while
ago, and we believe that both North and South must make joint efforts
to prevent such an incident from recurring," North Korean Cabinet
official Kim Ryong Sung said in a message relayed to South Korean
Unification Minister Jeong Se Hyun, according to officials in the
South.</LD>
<TE>   South Korea's government, which had demanded a full apology and
prosecution of the Northern sailors responsible, embraced the
statement as "highly significant."</TE>
<TE>   "We view North Korea's expression of regret and its reference to
efforts at preventing further incidents as a de facto apology," the
Unification Ministry said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government is eager to show that its so-called
sunshine policy of engaging the North is not a failure: The ruling
party faces two key elections before year's end, and public opinion
has hardened against the North.</TE>
<TE>   Apologies from North Korea have been relatively rare in the nearly
six decades of tensions on the divided peninsula. These include one
issued in 1976, when its troops killed two U.S. soldiers with axes at
the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone, and in 1996, when
one of its submarines ran aground off South Korea's east coast,
triggering a manhunt that left 13 South Koreans dead.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen, however, how well the half-apology will be
received beyond the Korean peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exactly what needed to be done to put the incident behind
them on the inter-Korean side," said Scott Snyder, Seoul
representative of the Asia Foundation, a San Francisco-based
organization that studies U.S.-Asia relations. "Now the question is
whether this can open the way for a resumption of U.S.-North Korea
meetings."</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Washington and Pyongyang are scheduled to attend a
Southeast Asian regional forum that will begin next week in Brunei,
which provides an opportunity for a meeting. Japanese media reported
Thursday that Japan and North Korea planned to meet for the first
time in two years.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's ruling Millennium Democratic Party hopes that the
expression of regret Thursday and the promise of renewed contact in
August at North Korea's Mt. Kumgang resort will help its flagging
electoral fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the scandal-plagued government would like to pull
off a meeting of separated families before the December presidential
election.</TE>
<TE>   Although most South Koreans welcome any easing of tension, they
have also grown wary of Pyongyang's intentions. Some are also
suspicious of their own government's bid to trumpet progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if this will all be received that warmly by voters,"
said Lee Dong Bok, professor at Seoul's Myongji University. "I think
too many people smell some political scent."</TE>
<TE>   Although it's difficult to determine the motive for North Korea's
statement, which came only a day after it warned Seoul to expect more
trouble, fear and desperation might be factors.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has indicated that it is considering a preemptive
strike against Iraq, one of three nations President Bush labeled part
of a global "axis of evil." Iran and North Korea were the others.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe North Korea is watching very closely the U.S. policy
toward Iraq," Snyder said. "If I were sitting in Pyongyang, I'd be a
little more nervous than before."</TE>
<TE>   After the clash at sea, Seoul threatened to give 300,000 tons of
surplus rice to livestock rather than the hungry North. The South
also debated whether to stop tourist visits to Mt. Kumgang, which
provide a source of hard currency for North Korea.</TE>

<HD>Nazi Ally Wins Ruling on Right to an Appeal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday that France was
wrong to deny Maurice Papon the right to an appeal, and his lawyers
said they would seek to overturn his 1998 conviction for
collaborating with the Nazis as a police official during World War
II.</LD>
<LD>   The court in Strasbourg ruled that France violated the 91-year-old
Papon's right to a fair trial by refusing to let him appeal the
conviction for his role in deporting Jews to death camps.</LD>
<LD>   Papon's attorney, Francis Vuillemin, said he would ask a French
commission to strike down Papon's conviction and grant a new trial.</LD>
<TE>   Serge Klarsfeld, a Nazi-hunter and historian who helped produce
much of the evidence used at Papon's trial, said any attempt at an
appeal or retrial would fail.</TE>
<TE>   "The French authorities ... have reiterated their condemnation,
not only of the Vichy state but also of those who were the servants
or executors of Vichy," Klarsfeld said. Vichy was the town where the
French collaborationist government was seated during the Nazi
occupation of France.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac has turned down three requests to
pardon Papon. His case has sparked an impassioned debate in France
about jailing the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   A court sentenced Papon to 10 years in prison for his role in
deporting 1,690 Jews between 1942 and 1944, when he was chief of
police in the Bordeaux region.</TE>

<HD>Pope Draws New Vitality From Youth Day Flock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>An invigorated Pope John Paul II, his frail body feeding on the
energy of 400,000 young Catholics who came to see him, counseled the
faithful in a strong voice Thursday that happiness can be found by
discovering "the path of forgiveness and reconciliation in a world
often laid waste by violence and terror."</LD>
<LD>   From a 25-foot-high platform reminiscent of a rock concert stage,
John Paul delivered his prescription for a fulfilling life to the
Roman Catholic Church's next generation during the three-hour opening
ceremony of World Youth Day, also dubbed "Popestock."</LD>
<LD>   The pope told his "dear young friends" that genuine satisfaction
can be gained only by following the path walked by Jesus, who was
"the poorest of the poor, the most gentle among the meek, the person
with the purest and most merciful heart."</LD>
<TE>   "I have heard your festive voices, your cries, your songs, and I
have felt the deep longing that beats within your hearts: You want to
be happy," said John Paul, who referred to himself as "the aged pope,
full of years but still young at heart."</TE>
<TE>   His words were interrupted often by screams, applause and chants
such as "John Paul Two, we love you!" from Catholics who came from
170 countries and ranged in age from roughly 15 to 35.</TE>
<TE>   "To believe in Jesus is to accept what he says, even when it runs
contrary to what others are saying," said the pope, sitting in a
large white and gold chair, his white hair ruffled by the warm summer
breeze.</TE>
<TE>   He used the venue on the shores of Lake Ontario to illustrate
Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, a radical treatise on how followers of
God should live, which the Gospels say was delivered on a hillside
overlooking the Sea of Tiberias.</TE>
<TE>   "Blessed are you if, like Jesus, you are poor in spirit, good and
merciful," the pope said. Before taking the stage, the pontiff spent
nearly 30 minutes waving from the back of his Mercedes popemobile,
which slowly weaved its way through the crowd with 10 bodyguards
walking alongside.</TE>
<TE>   As John Paul passed by, spectators snapped photos, cheered and
waved their nations' flags. Many wiped away tears.</TE>
<TE>   "He's supposedly very fragile," said Maria Dimitriou, a
16-year-old from Whyalla, Australia. "But he has the power like no
one else to reach inside us, grab our heart and kiss it."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul established World Youth Day in 1987 as a way to unite
young Catholics, deepen their faith and increase their evangelical
zeal. He has also been the featured attraction at each event; the
turnout at one such encounter reached 4.5 million people. This year's
program in Canada has attracted only a fraction of the usual number
of participants. Organizers attribute the lower turnout to post-Sept.
11 terrorism worries and doubts that the pope would be fit enough to
travel.</TE>
<TE>   But the 82-year-old pope's physical feats, though modest, thrilled
crowds here and surprised Vatican observers for the second time this
week. Because of the debilitating effects of Parkinson's disease,
arthritis and other maladies, the pope recently has been too weak to
finish even short speeches.</TE>
<TE>   But this week, he stunned aides and a Toronto airport crowd by
electing to walk down the steep steps of his private airplane after
his flight from Italy. And during Thursday's ceremony, John Paul
spoke for long periods, alternating between English and French, and
worked hard to lift his head high enough to make eye contact with the
crowd and convey a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Those close to the pope say the throngs of young people have
restored some of the pontiff's vigor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the dynamic between this pope and young people is
something very rich and very complex and cannot be explained in a few
words," said Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Vatican's spokesman. "It is
something very profound."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of Thursday's ceremony, after John Paul playfully
said goodbye in a number of languages, he motioned for some of the
teenagers to come to him. Those wanting to touch him or get a
blessing soon surrounded him. Alarmed cardinals and bishops at his
side quickly broke up the crowd of admirers.</TE>
<TE>   Events of World Youth Day, which is held about every two years, so
far have provided a respite from controversies that have pounded the
Catholic Church. The clergy sex scandal in the U.S. has been pushed
aside temporarily by images of young Catholic faithful from across
the globe walking, often hand in hand, through the streets of
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The pope refused Thursday to meet with representatives of the
Canadian chapter of Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, and
he hasn't mentioned the clergy scandal publicly. Also, questions
about whether John Paul will or should resign have been quieted this
week.</TE>
<TE>   The pope is in the midst of an 11-day trip to the Americas. He is
scheduled to leave Canada on Monday to travel to Guatemala and then
to Mexico, where he will canonize Juan Diego, a 16th century Aztec
peasant said to have encountered the Virgin Mary (Our Lady of
Guadalupe) near present-day Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   The pope plans to make two more public appearances for World Youth
Day, presiding over a special service Saturday evening and conducting
a Mass on Sunday.</TE>

<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>Brazil unveiled a state-of-the-art radar system Thursday that will
track everything from illegal landing strips to logging and mining to
climatic conditions in the Amazon.</LD>
<LD>   The system aims to thwart environmental destruction and
drug-dealing guerrillas while providing data to unlock the region's
economic potential.</LD>
<LD>   At the command post in Manaus, about 1,800 miles northwest of Rio
de Janeiro, a wall-sized map glows with points of light representing
the far-flung radar stations, data collection outposts and

<HD>China's Elite Has a Place in the Sun</HD>
<DH>Asia: Gathering at a coastal resort each year, Communist
Party elders mix play with politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIDAIHE, China</DL>
<LD>This seaside retreat from Beijing's scorching summers looks about as
refreshing as a steaming pot of dumpling soup. So many revelers are
frolicking on the waterfront, there's hardly a glimpse of sand or
sea.</LD>
<LD>   Just down the road, however, off-limits signs and out-of-town
police officers prevent the bathing-suit-clad masses from spilling
over to pristine stretches of fancy villas and deserted beaches.</LD>
<LD>   This is the storied resort town where politics with Chinese
characteristics ritually play out year after year as Communist Party
elders swim and play poker in hideaways while deciding on the future
leaders of the most populous nation on Earth.</LD>
<TE>   Ordinary Chinese seem resigned to the fact that they have no
influence over the selection of their next ruler. As they focus
instead on cooling off, the temperature is rising in one of the
hottest political guessing games in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing is just weeks away from the 16th Communist Party Congress,
the official platform to introduce the new chain of command that is
presumably assembled here.</TE>
<TE>   Every summer between July and August, the leaders come to Beidaihe
and step back into China's socialist past. The resort, about 170
miles east of Beijing, becomes a giant rest-and-recreation center
that rewards the party elite and select model workers with junkets.</TE>
<TE>   A 48-year-old former soldier said that when he was a kid, he
climbed over a wall and saw Chairman Mao riding his horse. He also
saw another top leader, Gen. Zhu De, stroll around town with only one
bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the only thing he can see are roadblocks and armies of
cops sealing off traffic as VIP motorcades zip on to seclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Very few locals can tell you why their Beijing visitors might be
on edge this year.</TE>
<TE>   The succession protocol calls for President Jiang Zemin, 75, to
step down and make way for Vice President Hu Jintao. He would
eventually take over all Jiang's posts--president, general secretary
of the Communist Party and military chief.</TE>
<TE>   Parliament Chairman Li Peng, 72, and Premier Zhu Rongji, 73, also
are expected to retire. Front-runners for their jobs are Li Ruihuan,
a member of the Politburo's standing committee, and Vice Premier Wen
Jiabao.</TE>
<TE>   If, however, Jiang rallies support here at the beach--as he is
expected to try to do--and clings to power, observers say it could
trigger a destructive power struggle threatening the country's
cherished social stability and the Communist Party's legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   The less dire scenario suggests that the new hierarchy is a fait
accompli. Aside from some mid-level positions still being hashed out,
the system is institutionalized enough to guarantee a predictable
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Jiang's departure from office is a done deal," said Andrew
Nathan, a Columbia University professor and longtime China observer.
To say Jiang wants to stay on is unthinkable, he said. "It would be a
terrible mess."</TE>
<TE>   Heir apparent Hu was handpicked by the late paramount leader Deng
Xiaoping. The 59-year-old vice president has been groomed for the top
job for a good part of the last decade. Absent a national or
international crisis, some observers say, Jiang's continued presence
would give the impression that things are out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Like his predecessor, Deng, Jiang would most likely hang on to the
powerful military chief post for a transition period. This is a
function less of a power struggle than logistics, observers say.
Instead of an abrupt change in leadership, Hu will ease into his new
jobs in stages, after a series of party and state meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Other obstacles standing in Jiang's way, if he wishes to remain in
charge, include fairness to other elder statesmen who also don't want
to leave. Particularly Li, the current second in command. The
leadership would have to create another job for him so as not to
upset the rest of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   A more important priority for Jiang, observers say, should be
cementing his legacy and continuing to wield influence after
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese president has already unleashed a propaganda whirlwind
around his theory of the "Three Represents," an awkward moniker for
Jiang's controversial call for the party to represent not only the
proletariat but also entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts caution, however, that in Chinese politics,
anything is possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I can guess what the outcome will be and someone else can guess a
different outcome, but the important thing is, both of us are
guessing," said Kenneth Lieberthal, a former advisor to the Clinton
administration now teaching at the University of Michigan. Beidaihe
"is a very dynamic environment where a lot can occur. It is not
possible to say with any confidence what the outcome of these
meetings will be. If you could, these meetings wouldn't need to
occur."</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the speculation is the uncertain date for the
all-important party congress. If it is held in September, it could
signal that the Beidaihe meetings succeeded in trouble-shooting
nagging issues. If it is scheduled for November, as some reports
indicate, internal rifts could be holding the entire process hostage.</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to be very suspicious of our ability to see through the
curtains," said Edward Friedman, who teaches Chinese politics at the
University of Wisconsin. "We're really all speculating from rumors
and leaks ... and flimsy so-called pieces of information."</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese have a sobering view of the situation. Despite
mind-boggling economic transformations, serious discussions about
political reforms remain taboo. U.S.-style democracy is still a world
away. Given the constraints, many Chinese are less interested in moot
debates about who's in charge and focus instead on the results.</TE>
<TE>   "If a country's fate rests on one person, then this country has no
future at all," said Sun Yan, a Communist Party historian at Beijing
University. "Whoever takes over should continue on the path of reform
and lead the people to better lives."</TE>

<HD>Hamas Leader Had Plotted Attack, Israel Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Militant slain in bombing aimed to kill hundreds,
defense minister declares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Thursday that the Hamas
military commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip
had been plotting a "mega-attack" that could have killed hundreds of
Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew this man was sitting and planning perhaps the largest
terror attack that ever happened in Israel. We call it here a
'mega-attack'--it was a truck with a ton of explosives whose aim was
to ... cause hundreds of deaths," Ben-Eliezer told members of his
center-left Labor Party.</LD>
<LD>   The raid that killed Salah Shehada and 14 other Palestinians, nine
of them children, raised an international outcry against Israel and
accusations that it sought to undermine efforts to broker a
cease-fire.</LD>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer voiced regret over the civilians killed when an
Israeli fighter plane bombed the house where Shehada was spending the
night with his wife, daughter and a Hamas deputy in a crowded
residential block of Gaza City.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer insisted that he did not know there were civilians
within reach of the explosion when he approved the strike.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas, a militant group that opposes Israel's existence, has
spearheaded a campaign of suicide bombings that has killed scores of
Israelis in a 22-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The group vowed revenge after Israel's strike in Gaza, and
Palestinian gunmen early Thursday killed a rabbi and wounded another
Israeli in a roadside ambush.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Elimelech Shapira, 43, was killed near the Jewish settlement
of Elei Zahav, south of the Palestinian town of Kalkilya, the Israeli
military said.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Israeli tanks entered Gaza City, residents said, in
the first military activity since the bombing of the Hamas leader
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said that seven tanks accompanied a bulldozer that
flattened a small Palestinian military intelligence position and a
metal workshop, and then soldiers blew up another workshop.</TE>
<TE>   Gunmen shot at the Israelis, and two Palestinians were wounded in
an exchange of fire, the witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said soldiers destroyed three buildings where
rockets were made, blowing up 22 Kassam rockets in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Hours earlier, a rocket hit an Israeli village just outside Gaza,
causing some damage but no casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, another victim of last week's suicide bombing in Tel
Aviv died of his wounds Thursday, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Three foreign workers and another Israeli were also killed in the
attack on July 18, in which two suicide bombers blew themselves up a
few seconds apart.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is at serious risk of a
heart attack and needs more time to rest, a report issued after a
U.N. medical examination has stated.</LD>
<LD>   "Milosevic is a man with severe cardiovascular risk which requires
future monitoring," presiding Judge Richard May of Britain said at
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Thursday. Details of the medical
report, ordered by the court in June after Milosevic spent several
weeks in bed, were not released.</LD>
<LD>   The tribunal recommended that Milosevic, who has led his own
defense, appoint legal counsel to reduce his workload.</LD>
<TE>   Responding angrily in court, Milosevic said he had never sought
medical examination. He again refused to appoint a lawyer, saying the
court "should not harbor any illusions that I am asking for
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic is being tried on 66 counts of war crimes allegedly
committed during the Yugoslav federation's breakup in the 1990s.</TE>

<HD>Nest Eggs Cushioned From Market's Drop</HD>
<DH>Retirement: Diversified investments have kept pensions from
falling as far as key stock indexes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the brutal stock market plunge of the last 2 1/2 years, there is
at least one bright spot: the nation's pension and retirement plans.</LD>
<LD>   Although pension plans of major corporations and government
agencies--along with 401(k) retirement plans of individual
employees--have taken losses in the market meltdown, they in
aggregate have not fallen anywhere near as much as the stock market
as a whole, largely because of the plans' conservative investment
approaches.</LD>
<LD>   As the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow Jones
industrial average declined more than 20% in the last year, corporate
and state pension plans and individual retirement plans lost only 5%
to 10%--largely because they have diversified investments among
bonds, stocks and real estate, according to surveys of thousands of
pension funds by consulting firms and research institutes.</LD>
<TE>   That means the retirement savings of millions of workers have not
been as hard hit as the market plunge would indicate. That could help
explain why consumer spending and the economy have held up much
better than the market.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no retirement crisis because of the stock market
decline," said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit
Research Institute, a Washington-based organization financed by
employers, unions and government agencies that monitors thousands of
pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, low overall savings rates and other problems pose a
long-term threat to Americans' retirement incomes.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are Salisbury and other experts minimizing the losses of
employees who had 401(k) accounts and other retirement funds invested
in the stocks of Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing
Ltd.--all now in bankruptcy proceedings--and other troubled
companies. Some of those workers have lost most or all of their
retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   But for the overall work force, the market's plunge has not caused
serious damage to prospects for retirement income, experts said. For
most workers, problems with their ability to retire stem less from
the stock market plunge than from the fact that they have not saved
enough, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Lesser Effect of Markets</TE>
<TE>   Stock markets simply don't have the effect on consumer attitudes
that many believe they do, said Robert J. Shiller, Yale University
economics professor and coauthor of a paper on so-called wealth
effects.</TE>
<TE>   Housing prices--which have continued to rise while the stock
market has plunged--have a strong effect on consumer feelings of
wealth, Shiller and his colleagues found, but stock prices do not.</TE>
<TE>   So this "drop in the stock market wouldn't have much effect on
consumers' spending," said Shiller, who gained public prominence in
2000 with his book "Irrational Exuberance," which said investor
enthusiasm had driven stock prices to unsustainable levels.</TE>
<TE>   Investment managers for pension funds and even individuals
investing for their own retirement apparently were not carried away
by irrational exuberance, pension experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Managers for pension funds are governed by rules of prudent
judgment to spread investments among fixed-income securities such as
Treasury and corporate bonds, along with real estate and stocks.
Typically, such funds hold 40% of their assets in non-stock
investments and shift money out of stocks as rising prices make that
portion of the portfolio top-heavy.</TE>
<TE>   Many individuals likewise have kept investments diversified among
Treasury bonds and bills and bank certificates of deposit, as well as
stocks. And the 401(k) plans most companies offer to employees
include relatively conservative mutual funds, not
all-technology-stock funds and other high-risk varieties that have
suffered severe losses.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, pension funds typically invest with a long-term
horizon. At the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the
nation's largest public pension plan, investments are made on a
10-year perspective in accordance with strict ratios for allocating
assets among bonds, stocks and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS is shifting more of its funds into stocks as part of a
normal process to take profits and move money out of investments that
have performed well (bonds) into those that have lagged (stocks).
During the height of the stock boom, it shifted money from stocks
into bonds.</TE>
<TE>   These days "we are buying equities," said Mark Anson, CalPERS'
chief investment officer. "We are selling our gains in fixed-income
securities and buying $200 million to $300 million in equities with
every 50 point drop in the S&amp;P 500," Anson said. That index has
fallen almost 400 points in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS' mammoth investment portfolio has lost only about 5% in
the last year, going from $156 billion to about $149 billion at
present, because gains in bonds and real estate reduced the overall
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, General Motors Corp.'s pension plan--the nation's
largest corporate plan, with about $65 billion in assets fell 5.7% in
2001 from a year earlier and 3% more in the first half of 2002, far
less than the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   That and similar minimal losses among other pension plans is good
news for the 42 million American workers in private industry and
state and local governments who are dependent on those guaranteed
pension plans--called defined benefit plans--for most of their
retirement income. Those with such guaranteed pensions are in the
minority, as so-called defined contribution plans--including 401(k)s
and individual retirement accounts--have grown to dominance.</TE>
<TE>   But the results shown by 401(k)s and other defined contribution
plans, which cover 58 million U.S. workers, are comparable to those
of the corporate plans. Defined contribution plans lost 10.9% of
their value, or $248 billion, in 2000 and 2001, bringing their total
assets to $2.2 trillion, according to a study by Cerulli Associates,
a Boston-based pension advisory firm. By contrast, the S&amp;P 500 was
down 20% in those same two years.</TE>
<TE>   The performance was decidedly better than the stock market as a
whole because individuals had kept a good portion of their money in
non-stock investments.</TE>
<TE>   And such accounts have become even more conservative this year,
experts said, because individuals have been transferring funds from
stocks to money market funds, Treasuries and other less risky
investments.</TE>
<TE>   A Need for Concern</TE>
<TE>   However, there still are many reasons for concern about prospects
for retirement income of U.S. workers, beginning with the fact that
savings are low. In the aggregate, personal savings among Americans
is only 1.6% of disposable income, the Federal Reserve has
determined.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances shows that half of U.S.
households have no savings to speak of.</TE>
<TE>   With Social Security expected to provide only a fraction of the
income needed for a comfortable retirement, the low level of
individual savings is the most serious threat to future living
standards of retired Americans, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   A new study projects that retired families face expenditures that
will exceed their available income by $10,000 over the period of
their retirement. The study, done in Kansas by the Milbank Memorial
Fund and the Employee Benefit Research Institute, is the first of a
planned series of studies on all states.</TE>
<TE>   There also are concerns about the long-term solvency of the
nation's pension insurance agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., which is funded by industry but administered by the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   The PBGC's reserve against pension claims is at $5 billion, but
the agency faces claims amounting to $9 billon because of underfunded
pension plans in bankrupt steel companies and troubled firms in the
airline and retail industries, Steven Kandarian, the PBGC's executive
director, told Congress last month.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the PBGC said, many pension funds of major
corporations have become underfunded in the wake of losses in stock
portfolios, meaning that the companies must put more money into their
defined benefit pension plans to make good on the future payments
promised to worker beneficiaries. The additional money that
corporations must put in will reduce profits, which in turn could
lower their stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors, for example, put $2 billion into its pension fund
in April and plans to put in $7 billion more to bring the fund to
full-funded status, a spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>Low View of Adelphia's High Life</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Rigas family routinely raided the firm's
accounts, federal documents allege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early last year cable mogul John Rigas allegedly was taking so much
money from Adelphia Communications Corp. that his son Tim Rigas, the
company's chief financial officer, had to put on the brakes.</LD>
<LD>   Tim notified Michael Mulcahey, Adelphia's finance executive in
charge of the company's cash, that he must approve any further
requests by his father beyond a $1-million-a-month limit. Over the
next year, $12 million--paid in increments of about $1 million a
month--was wired from Adelphia to John Rigas' personal account at
Bank of New York, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   As far as Adelphia shareholders knew, John Rigas was paid about
$1.9 million a year. They were not told about the additional
payments, as required by law, according to a criminal lawsuit filed
this week by the Justice Department against five former Adelphia
executives, including John and Tim Rigas and Mulcahey.</LD>
<TE>   The payments were part of a widespread pattern of deceit alleged
in the federal case and a related civil complaint filed Wednesday
that accuse the executives of improperly using corporate funds for
personal enrichment, charging them with several counts of mail, wire
and securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases doctored financial records at Adelphia and created
sham transactions and phony companies to inflate the firm's earnings
and to conceal its mounting debts, the suits allege. Adelphia is the
nation's sixth-biggest cable TV operator and the largest in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Fleming, a lawyer for the Rigases, said he would challenge
allegations that the family was using Adelphia's money for personal
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear from the complaints precisely what Rigas was buying
with his alleged $1-million-a-month allowance. But since he founded
Adelphia in 1952 in the sleepy outpost of Coudersport in rural
Pennsylvania, this son of Greek immigrants who grew up above his
family's hot-dog joint has upgraded his lifestyle significantly.</TE>
<TE>   The family routinely stayed at vacation homes in Cancun, Mexico;
Beaver Creek, Colo.; and Hilton Head, S.C., as well as two luxury
apartments on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Three private jets in
the only hangar at the airport near the company's headquarters
whisked Tim and his friends to an African safari or to a castle in
the south of France.</TE>
<TE>   A $700,000 membership at a luxury country club is said to have
kept Tim well-practiced in his favorite hobby, golf. He also was busy
overseeing construction of a world-class 18-hole course on the
outskirts of Coudersport for visiting cable TV dignitaries and top
executives of Adelphia. Tim said it would make it easier to recruit
top executives to the hamlet, a five-hour drive from the nearest
major airport, in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's shareholders paid for many of these family perks,
according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Intermingled Finances</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities allege that the fraud cost Adelphia
shareholders nearly $6 billion in lost value since late March, when
the company's stock plunged after the Rigases disclosed they had
taken out $2.3 billion in personal loans backed by the cable giant.
In May the Rigases relinquished control of the company, and last
month Adelphia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because of
a cash crisis.</TE>
<TE>   John Rigas and two of his sons, Tim and Michael, were arraigned
and each released on $10-million bail Wednesday. Mulcahey and another
former corporate officer, James Brown, also were released, without
bail.</TE>
<TE>   In the two lawsuits, authorities described how the Rigases
allegedly used Adelphia as their personal cash register: Revenues
from Adelphia subsidiaries and the scores of businesses owned by the
Rigas family were dumped into one central account. Bills then were
paid out of the same account, an accounting no-no.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the financial affairs of Adelphia and the Rigas Family
Entities were intermingled ... the financial results of the Rigas
Family Entities were not consolidated or combined with Adelphia's on
Adelphia's financial statements," the Justice Department complaint
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases also drew money out of Adelphia through many of their
privately owned firms. A car dealership owned by John Rigas leased
some of the vehicles in Adelphia's corporate fleet. An interior
decorating shop run by his wife, Doris, sold furniture and design
services to Adelphia. A farm owned by John supplied landscaping, snow
removal and other maintenance services to Adelphia. And the Buffalo
Sabres hockey team, owned by the family, sold hundreds of tickets
every year to Adelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Distributing Largess</TE>
<TE>   In Coudersport, John Rigas was widely considered a hometown hero.
He espoused conservative values and prevented Adelphia from carrying
sex-oriented channels on its cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   Townsfolk looked upon Rigas as something of a Santa Claus because
he shared Adelphia's wealth. He gave out Sabres tickets to employees,
he sent his trucks into town to plow residents' driveways during
snowstorms, he ferried ailing locals to medical treatments by car and
plane. Adelphia's shareholders appear to have picked up at least part
of the tab, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, John Rigas' practice of buying land from destitute
farmers put 10,000 acres into his hands. The land produced Christmas
trees, maple syrup, sunflowers and other crops. Also on the farm was
a one-hole golf course and the tasteful stone Rigas homestead, where
John and Doris live with sons Tim and Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Tim had grand plans to turn 661 acres of the farmland, at the
headwaters of the Allegheny and Susquehanna rivers, into a golf
course designed by the renowned Robert Trent Jones Jr. Locals saw the
development as a symbol of Tim's arrogance. There already was one
local public golf course; the area didn't need two, to their
thinking. Yet after fighting off the critics, including
environmentalists who worried about pesticide runoff into the
trout-filled rivers, the Rigases broke ground on the course in March
2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the criminal lawsuits, the Rigases used $13 million
of Adelphia's money and 169 acres of company-owned land for the
project but never disclosed it to shareholders or asked for board
approval.</TE>
<TE>   The bulldozers came to a halt several months ago, and heavy rains
began washing the sculpted mounds of soil into the rivers. The
project lies idle, with $40 million needed for completion.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases' dreams began to collapse in March, when the company
revealed in a footnote in its 2001 financial results that the family
had borrowed $2.3 billion, guaranteed by Adelphia. (The criminal
complaint said the company failed to disclose similar loans to the
family of more than $1 billion the previous year.)</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.'s Oren Cohen asked for a clarification of the loans, drawing
attention to Adelphia's surprising new debt. In the aftermath of the
Enron Corp. accounting scandal only a few months earlier, investors
began bailing out of Adelphia's stock, which plunged 18% on the news.
Within three months, it was worth only pennies a share.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, as Adelphia issued more shares to pay down debt,
the Rigases gave Wall Street the appearance of support by purchasing
large amounts of stock. What shareholders did not realize was that
the Rigases were buying those shares with loans backed by Adelphia,
thereby piling up debt in off-balance-sheet partnerships, according
to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the family's loans were guaranteed with Adelphia stock,
and when the shares dropped in value, the Rigases' lenders forced
them to put up cash as collateral in so-called margin calls.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, as Adelphia was assuring investors and regulators
that it was working out debt problems, the Rigases secretly diverted
$174 million from corporate accounts to meet lenders' margin calls,
court documents said. This brought to $252 million the amount of
Adelphia funds used by the Rigases to pay for 65 margin calls by
their lenders, according to the criminal suit.</TE>

<TE>   Adelphia's Missing Money</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
have filed charges of securities, bank and wire fraud against three
members of the Rigas family and two former executives of Adelphia
Communications Corp. Among the allegations:</TE>
<TE>   * $12.8 million in Adelphia funds was used for the construction of
a golf course on 830 acres of land mostly owned by the Rigases and
was not disclosed to Adelphia investors.</TE>
<TE>   * $252 million was paid by Adelphia to cover personal margin loans
and other debts of the Rigas family and was not reported to Adelphia
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   * The Rigases had exclusive use of luxury condominiums in
Colorado, Mexico and New York that were paid for by Adelphia without
being disclosed to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Source: Times research</TE>
<TE>   * The daughter and son-in-law of founder John Rigas had exclusive
use of two New York apartments rent-free for four years. The use of
the apartments, whose rental value was at least $150,000, is not
disclosed to the public.</TE>
<TE>   * John Rigas spent large amounts of Adelphia funds. From early
2001 to early 2002, he received cash payments of about $1 million a
month from Adelphia to his personal account at Bank of New York.</TE>
<TE>   During this time, Adelphia falsely reported that John Rigas' total
compensation for 2000 was less than $1.9 million.</TE>

<HD>Man Charged in 4 Deaths Tied to Arson</HD>
<DH>Fire: He is booked on suspicion of setting a blaze in the
Hollywood Hills in May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAPD detectives on Thursday arrested a 26-year-old Los Angeles man on
suspicion of murder in the deaths of four members of an Indian
immigrant family, whose charred remains were found inside a Hollywood
Hills home that fire investigators say was intentionally set on fire
in May.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Amador, 26, was booked on four counts of murder and one
count of arson in connection with the Lakeridge Drive blaze, police
said. Found dead inside the house were Gita Kumar, 43; her son Paras,
18; her daughter Tulsi, 16; and Gita Kumar's mother-in-law, Sitaben
Patel, 63.</LD>
<LD>   Amador was led in handcuffs into LAPD's Parker Center headquarters
shortly after 1 p.m. after his arrest in Cerritos by LAPD
Robbery-Homicide division detectives. "He is one of the suspects and
there are other suspects that remain at large," said Robbery-Homicide
Lt. Don Hartwell.</LD>
<TE>   Harish "Harry" Kumar returned home shortly after 11 p.m. May 4 to
discover his bungalow ablaze. His wife, son, daughter and mother were
dead inside. Fire investigators quickly identified the blaze as arson
after finding traces of a flammable liquid in more than one location
inside the house. The blaze, they said, had begun in two bedrooms.
The bodies were found in one room of the house and were so badly
burned that dental records were required to identify them.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Robbery-Homicide Capt. Jim Tatreau declined to specify
a motive, but said of Amador, "We believe he was directly involved
[in the deaths]." The county coroner's office has not released a
cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Investigating detectives have focused on Harish Kumar's business
relationships. The family's personal computers and financial records
were searched for clues.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar, 47, owns four motels in the Los Angeles area, including the
Universal City Inn in Studio City, which he bought in 1990. He also
owns motels in south Los Angeles and on Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar was interviewed after the killings, but he was not
considered a suspect, according to detectives. Kumar's cousin, Danny
Patel, said police had given Kumar a polygraph test, but the LAPD has
not confirmed that.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the fire, Kumar attended a volleyball tournament
in Bakersfield with friends, according to a relative, Chantu Patel.
Relatives said Kumar had been eager to get home because his son Paras
had returned from UC San Diego that day to spend the weekend with his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that, about 11:16 p.m., Kumar called 911, saying the
three-bedroom home had been ablaze when he pulled up in his minivan.
Firefighters found him standing on the front lawn screaming for help
.</TE>
<TE>   Pierpont Laidley, an attorney for Kumar, said there may have been
$3,000 to $4,000 in cash receipts from the hotels' businesses at the
house that night. Laidley said Gita Kumar had returned from India a
day earlier and was catching up on bookkeeping.</TE>
<TE>   After the fire, friends of Tulsi Kumar, a Reseda High School
student, held a memorial service on the campus. Friends and relatives
called Gita Kumar a dedicated mother and sharp businesswoman who
helped with the hotel business. Paras Kumar, a freshman at UC San
Diego, was known as an A student, and Tulsi was remembered for her
kindness to others.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of a former Arcadia police officer who killed a sheriff's
deputy and then died himself during a fiery shootout at his home in
Stevenson Ranch last year filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   Donna J. Beck accused the deputies of using excessive force
against her son, James, 35, a felon who allegedly had stockpiled
weapons inside the house.</LD>
<LD>   The deputies, accompanied by federal agents, went to the house
last Aug. 31 to serve a search warrant. They said Beck opened fire,
killing Deputy Hagop Kuredjian.</LD>
<TE>   When deputies lobbed a tear-gas grenade into the house, it caught
fire and was engulfed in flames.</TE>
<TE>   In her suit, Beck's mother alleges that deputies allowed the
two-story house to burn down and prevented firefighters from putting
out the flames.</TE>
<TE>   The suit accuses the deputies of civil rights violations, wrongful
death, false imprisonment and negligence.</TE>

<HD>Blake's Daughter, 35, Wins Guardianship of Half-Sister</HD>
<DH>Courts: She will care for the 2-year-old child the actor
had with woman he's accused of killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake's older daughter was granted permanent guardianship
Thursday of the actor's 2-year-old child with the woman he is accused
of killing.</LD>
<LD>   Delinah Blake, 35, has cared for the child, Rose Lenore Sophia
Blake, since their father was arrested April 18 in the fatal shooting
of his 44-year-old wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, near a Studio City
restaurant in May 2001.</LD>
<LD>   In his ruling, Los Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner H.
Ronald Hauptman denied a request by the child's maternal aunt,
Margerry Bakley, to delay a decision until she hired an attorney to
represent her interests.</LD>
<TE>   Bakley said she wants the court to grant her visitation rights,
but the judge said she did not have any standing as the child's aunt.
Bakley said she last saw her niece in April during a supervised visit
at the home of one of Blake's lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   In her petition for guardianship, Delinah Blake said she had
helped her father care for Rose since about September 2000, when the
child was 3 months old. She also wrote that she was qualified to
raise Rose, both as her half-sister and as a clinical psychologist
who works with abused and neglected children.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 68, is being held without bail at Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts
of soliciting murder and conspiracy. He faces life in prison without
parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Bakley, surrounded by her manager, an
attorney and a bodyguard, said she wants Rose to grow up knowing her
mother's side of the family.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Eric J. Dubin, said Bakley just "wants to give the
little girl a hug" and be able to tell Rose "I love you."</TE>
<TE>   Bakley also expressed concern about the child's future. "If, in
fact, Mr. Blake gets out of jail, I don't want him near my niece,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorney, Barry Felsen, said his client will be pleased
with the judge's ruling. "This is exactly what should have happened,"
Felsen said, adding that Blake was "most concerned" that Delinah
Blake be allowed to raise the youngest of his three children. Blake
also has an adult son.</TE>
<TE>   Felsen said that Blake's attorneys had been negotiating another
visitation for Bakley, but that those discussions ended last month
when she fired her attorney. He said Delinah Blake will now decide
which relatives may spend time with the child.</TE>

<HD>2 Consulate Employees Killed as Car, Bus Collide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two members of the staff of the Australian Consulate for the Los
Angeles area were killed and another was critically injured Wednesday
night when their car collided with a bus near Los Angeles
International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Police identified the dead as Robert Vicelich, 27, a citizen of
New Zealand, and Elizabeth Ewing, also 27, a U.S. citizen. The
23-year-old injured woman, also a U.S. citizen, was not identified.</LD>
<LD>   Australian Consul General Allan Rocher said Vicelich had worked at
the consulate in Culver City for three years, dealing with Australian
citizens visiting or living in Southern California. Rocher said his
duties had included handling problems resulting from traffic
accidents.</LD>
<TE>   Rocher said Ewing had worked for the consulate for more than two
years as a financial administrator, and the injured woman, recently
hired, had been a part-time helper to Ewing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're distraught," Rocher said. "This is not a happy place to be
today, but everyone is providing mutual support."</TE>
<TE>   A police spokesman, Jack Richter, said the accident occurred when
Vicelich was turning left from Sepulveda Westway, a small street a
block west of Sepulveda Boulevard, into the westbound lanes of
Manchester Avenue. The car collided with the bus, which was
eastbound.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters had to extricate those in the car.</TE>
<TE>   No passengers on the Big Blue Bus from Santa Monica were hurt, but
the driver suffered minor injuries, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Richter said accounts from witnesses were contradictory, and
police were investigating who had the right of way.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Stitcher, customer relations director for the Big Blue Bus
lines, said their officials hadn't seen a police report yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, all we can say is that we're concerned about our
employees and passengers having to go through something this
dramatic, and we regret the loss of life that took place," Stitcher
said.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Formed a Posse With a Plea</HD>
<DH>Profile: Orange County official used personal appearances
to beseech the public for tips in the killing of Samantha Runnion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no playbook for dealing with the public, no secret list of
do's and don'ts squirreled away in a drawer just in case a 5-year-old
girl was kidnapped, sexually abused and murdered.</LD>
<LD>   So Michael S. Carona, only a few months from the end of his first
four-year term as Orange County sheriff, made up the playbook himself
last week, using personal appearances to organize "a modern-day
posse" of investigators, the media and the public in a desperate hunt
for a little girl, then for her killer.</LD>
<LD>   In a whirlwind week that began with the snatching of Samantha
Runnion from a Stanton condominium complex and ended with the arrest
of Alejandro Avila, Carona earned high praise--and a lengthy ovation
as he rose to speak Wednesday at a memorial service for Samantha at
Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral.</LD>
<TE>   "I can tell you that was a real humbling experience," Carona told
the crowd after turning away to compose himself. "It's been very
embarrassing to me to hear the words of thanks that come from Orange
County and in California and across the nation.... We didn't know the
world was watching."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was Carona's savvy management of the media that helped
rivet the nation's attention as he worked behind the scenes to draw
together traditionally turf-conscious law-enforcement
agencies--including the beleaguered Federal Bureau of
Investigation--into a cooperative venture driven to flush out
Samantha's killer.</TE>
<TE>   It was a highly personalized effort in which Carona's emotions
seemed to bubble just below the surface as the sheriff beseeched the
public to help, and addressed Samantha's killer directly, both before
Avila emerged as a suspect and after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "When I told you that we would hunt you down, wherever you were,
arrest you and bring you to justice, if you thought for one minute
that I was joking, that we were joking, tonight you know that we were
deadly serious," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   But Carona also drew sharp criticism for issuing a public warning
based on a speculative FBI profile that a serial killer might be
roaming Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "I was astonished and surprised" by that blunt warning, said James
Alan Fox, professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in
Boston. "There was no evidence the person had done it before. From
what I can tell, no other cases have been linked.... This guy
[Carona] seems to be interested in parading on television shows."</TE>
<TE>   Carona, though, said the "parading" was part of a quickly hatched
strategy to do whatever was needed to saturate the media with images
of Samantha and the sketches of her suspected killer.</TE>
<TE>   The plan: to create what Carona called a "modern-day posse" that
could cover exponentially more turf than could investigators assigned
to the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a high-risk gamble, no doubt about it," Carona said. "It
was a race against time. We made some tough tactical decisions that,
by the grace of God and because our team executed so well, were
successful."</TE>
<TE>   All major law-enforcement departments have set operating standards
for handling major crimes, laying out such crucial steps as
determining which agency will be in charge, what other agencies to
draft for help, who will handle the inevitable media requests and
press conferences, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Where Carona veered into uncharted waters was bridging the usual
information gap between an investigation and the media, and to issue
dramatic and personal appeals for help instead of letting the
department's official spokesman, Jim Amormino, do the talking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different visual impact for citizens when their sheriff
says, 'I need your help' [instead of] a guy in a suit saying, 'The
sheriff needs your help,' " Carona said during an interview in his
spacious second-floor Santa Ana office next to the jail holding
Avila, 27. "We used the media to let the public know what we had, and
that we needed the public's help."</TE>
<TE>   Carona, a compact man invariably dressed in his official green
uniform, held 3:30 a.m. press conferences to accommodate network news
shows based in New York City. He appeared live on CNN, Fox News and
other networks, and made himself available to just about any
journalist who would talk to him--all part of a campaign to extend
the search as deeply as he could.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking to Southern California and residents of California"
through the national media, Carona said, "because that's where I
thought he was."</TE>
<TE>   The payoff came in phoned-in tips directing investigators to
Avila, shortening the time it would have taken to focus on the Lake
Elsinore assembly-line worker based on forensic evidence left at the
scene, Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Avila has denied he was involved in what court records described
as two sexual assaults and the strangulation of Samantha. Avila is to
be arraigned next month on charges of kidnapping, sexual assault and
murder.</TE>
<TE>   During the manhunt, Carona remained poised and intense in press
conferences and interviews. At times pugnacious, he generally exuded
the kind of calmness that can reassure a jittery public--even as he
speculated about a possible serial killer and urged people to call
police about any suspicions they had about others.</TE>
<TE>   Carona quickly became the public face of the investigation for a
nation haunted by the prospect of a sexual predator willing to kill,
and struck numb by the beatific smile of a now-dead little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "I give him high marks," said Ian Mitroff, a crisis-management
expert and director of the Annenberg Center for Strategic Public
Relations at the University of California. "One thing he did, he
showed emotion, and I don't think inappropriately.... This guy put
his heart on his sleeve."</TE>
<TE>   Key to Carona's success, Mitroff said, was his ability to
convincingly play two roles at once.</TE>
<TE>   "You felt he was someone with strong cognitive smarts who knows
how to deal with the system and coordinate the roles of police
agencies," Mitroff said. "On the other hand, you want to feel you're
dealing with somebody who cares."</TE>
<TE>   Those who know Carona said the public face he presented was also
his private face, reflecting a personal management style that seeks
to lead by consensus--a rarity in law enforcement's tradition of
paramilitary structure and top-down commands.</TE>
<TE>   That approach has earned Carona high praise even from his
deputies' union, which bitterly opposed his first campaign for
sheriff in 1998. During that campaign, critics labeled him a
law-enforcement neophyte who had spent most of his career dealing
with courthouse security at the Orange County marshal's office.</TE>
<TE>   A mark of the changed tide: Carona ran unopposed for reelection
last spring, with the broad support of the same people who four years
ago fought him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a natural leader, and I think his heart is in the
right place," said Sgt. Wayne Quint, president of the Orange County
Assn. of Deputy Sheriffs, who opposed Carona's 1998 election. "He
cares deeply about people."</TE>
<TE>   The command center established to find Samantha and her killer was
a coalition forged amid adrenaline rushes and sleepless nights.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was doing an outstanding job of marshaling the
resources that were at his disposal and in getting interagency
cooperation," said Mark Geragos, a Los Angeles defense lawyer who
appeared with Carona on CNN's "Larry King Live."</TE>
<TE>   Every public statement, Carona said, was discussed ahead of time
among representatives of all the involved agencies. Yet the final
decisions were his.</TE>
<TE>   "We would look at every new bit of information and debate what it
meant," Carona said. "All the players sat at the table. I tried to
get unanimous support, and at the worst tried to get a consensus."</TE>
<TE>   Part of his management style, he said, is to take the blame when
something goes wrong, and to spread around praise when something
finishes well. That led to an awkward moment last week when live
broadcasts cut away from Carona's final press conference of lengthy
thank-yous, returning only when the question-and-answer session
began.</TE>
<TE>   One of the realities of the sheriff's job is that he is elected,
so political concerns often frame decision-making. That wasn't the
case in the search for Samantha and her killer, Carona insisted, or
in the decision to warn the public of the fear that the killer could
strike again.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt as a public safety issue, the need to catch this guy
outweighed any political risks I might take," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us ever said that if we were wrong, it's your political
career. But intuitively, we knew that if we were right, we would all
have a success."</TE>
<TE>   Although Carona's public profile is higher now than ever, he said
this week he has not decided what his next career step will be.</TE>
<TE>   A former Orange County marshal, Carona's academic background was
in management, including a master's degree focusing on public
administration through the University of Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   But Carona, who lives in Orange, also has a background in criminal
justice studies and worked his way up through the ranks at the
marshal's office. He was appointed in 1988, at age 31, to run the
office after an election by 105 Superior and Municipal Court judges.</TE>
<TE>   Carona said his options include running for a state-level office
or moving into the private sector after a career that so far has been
dedicated to public service.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be life after sheriff," he said. "The thing is,
I love the job I have."</TE>

<HD>Carona Formed a Posse With a Plea</HD>
<DH>Crime: O.C. sheriff went high-profile to beseech the public
for tips in girl's killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no playbook for dealing with the public, no secret list of
do's and don'ts squirreled away in a drawer just in case a 5-year-old
girl was kidnapped, sexually abused and murdered.</LD>
<LD>   So Michael S. Carona, only a few months from the end of his first
four-year term as Orange County sheriff, made up the playbook himself
last week, using personal appearances to organize "a modern-day
posse" of investigators, the media and the public in a desperate hunt
for a little girl, then for her killer.</LD>
<LD>   In a whirlwind week that began with the snatching of Samantha
Runnion from a Stanton condominium complex and ended with the arrest
of Alejandro Avila, Carona earned high praise--and a lengthy ovation
as he rose to speak Wednesday at a memorial service for Samantha at
Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral.</LD>
<TE>   "I can tell you that was a real humbling experience," Carona told
the crowd after turning away to compose himself. "It's been very
embarrassing to me to hear the words of thanks that come from Orange
County and in California and across the nation.... We didn't know the
world was watching."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was Carona's savvy management of the media that helped
rivet the nation's attention as he worked behind the scenes to draw
together traditionally turf-conscious law-enforcement
agencies--including the beleaguered Federal Bureau of
Investigation--into a cooperative venture driven to flush out
Samantha's killer.</TE>
<TE>   It was a highly personalized effort in which Carona's emotions
seemed to bubble just below the surface as the sheriff beseeched the
public to help, and addressed Samantha's killer directly, both before
Avila emerged as a suspect and after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "When I told you that we would hunt you down, wherever you were,
arrest you and bring you to justice, if you thought for one minute
that I was joking, that we were joking, tonight you know that we were
deadly serious," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   But Carona also drew sharp criticism for issuing a public warning
based on a speculative FBI profile that a serial killer might be
roaming Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "I was astonished and surprised" by that blunt warning, said James
Alan Fox, professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in
Boston. "There was no evidence the person had done it before. From
what I can tell, no other cases have been linked.... This guy
[Carona] seems to be interested in parading on television shows."</TE>
<TE>   Carona, though, said the "parading" was part of a quickly hatched
strategy to do whatever was needed to saturate the media with images
of Samantha and the sketches of her suspected killer.</TE>
<TE>   The plan: to create what Carona called a "modern-day posse" that
could cover exponentially more turf than could investigators assigned
to the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a high-risk gamble, no doubt about it," Carona said. "It
was a race against time."</TE>
<TE>   All major law-enforcement departments have set operating standards
for handling major crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Where Carona veered into uncharted waters was bridging the usual
information gap between an investigation and the media, and to issue
dramatic and personal appeals for help instead of letting the
department's official spokesman, Jim Amormino, do the talking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different visual impact for citizens when their sheriff
says, 'I need your help' [instead of] a guy in a suit saying, 'The
sheriff needs your help,' " Carona said during an interview in his
Santa Ana office next to the jail holding Avila, 27. "We used the
media to let the public know what we had, and that we needed the
public's help."</TE>
<TE>   Carona held 3:30 a.m. press conferences to accommodate network
news shows based in New York City. He appeared live on CNN, Fox News
and other networks, and made himself available to just about any
journalist who would talk to him--all part of a campaign to extend
the search.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking to Southern California and residents of California"
through the national media, Carona said, "because that's where I
thought he was."</TE>
<TE>   The payoff came in phoned-in tips directing investigators to
Avila, shortening the time it would have taken to focus on the Lake
Elsinore assembly-line worker based on forensic evidence left at the
scene, Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Avila has denied he was involved in what court records described
as two sexual assaults and the strangulation of Samantha. Avila is to
be arraigned next month on charges of kidnapping, sexual assault and
murder.</TE>
<TE>   During the manhunt, Carona remained poised and intense in press
conferences and interviews. At times pugnacious, he generally exuded
the kind of calmness that can reassure a jittery public--even as he
speculated about a possible serial killer and urged people to call
police about any suspicions they had about others.</TE>
<TE>   Carona quickly became the public face of the investigation for a
nation haunted by the prospect of a sexual predator willing to kill,
and struck numb by the beatific smile of a now-dead little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "I give him high marks," said Ian Mitroff, a crisis-management
expert and director of the Annenberg Center for Strategic Public
Relations at the University of California. "One thing he did, he
showed emotion, and I don't think inappropriately.... This guy put
his heart on his sleeve."</TE>
<TE>   Key to Carona's success, Mitroff said, was his ability to

<HD>Cemetery's Expansion Plans OKd</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Vocal opposition fails to derail project at famed
Westwood burial site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With residents decrying a "condominium of corpses" in their
backyards, city planners Thursday approved an expansion of famed
Westwood Village Memorial Park.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents won a concession, however, as planners ordered the
cemetery owner to put in landscaping and to build an 8-foot masonry
wall between houses and graves, a wall that the neighborhood was
promised 50 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Residents, however, lost their bid to require a setback for the
new buildings, which the owner intends to build at the property line.</LD>
<TE>   The expansion plan approved by the Planning Commission will allow
463 new casket spaces in an 18-foot-high mausoleum about 65 feet from
several homes on Wellworth Avenue. There also will be a private
12-casket "family mausoleum" 8 feet from one Wellworth Avenue
property.</TE>
<TE>   The city code calls for a 300-foot setback between cemetery
structures and residential properties, but the cemetery owner won
approval by arguing successfully that the expansion fulfills a
community need.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of such an increase in the number of crypts, next to
an existing multitiered mausoleum, has riled survivors of the rich
and famous who paid dearly to lay their relatives to rest in the
urban oasis at 1218 Glendon Ave., near Westwood's corridor of
high-rise condominiums along Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "How dare you turn this beautiful and sacred place into Disneyland
for the dead!" Audrey Wilder, widow of director Billy Wilder, said to
commissioners. Noting that she had paid $200,000 for his site, she
said, "If that doesn't entitle him to some peace, I want my money
back, and I'll take him somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Also at the meeting were Tita Cahn, whose late husband, lyricist
Sammy Cahn, is buried there, and Margo Winkler, who is married to
producer Irwin Winkler.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the project paraded to the microphone to raise
concerns about privacy, parking, fire protection and preserving the
cemetery's scale. One opponent, Shelley Taylor, read from letters by
celebrities and their relatives. Author Dominick Dunne, whose
daughter Dominique is buried there, in his letter decried the plans
as vulgar and intrusive, and vowed to write about them in Vanity Fair
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Charles Matthau, son of the late Walter Matthau,
said, "At best this is a vulgar display of raw greed; at worst it is
sacrilegious."</TE>
<TE>   A popular site for tour vans and celebrity seekers, the site also
houses the remains of Truman Capote, Carroll O'Connor, Jack Lemmon,
Roy Orbison and Marilyn Monroe, whose burial there 40 years ago put
the compact site on the map.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery has space for 1,126 caskets on nearly three acres and
is nearly full. The Houston-based owner, Service Corp. International,
had originally proposed to erect another building behind homes on
Wellworth for 1,488 crypts. But planners rejected that idea in May.</TE>
<TE>   "We're anxious to work with the neighbors," said Allan Abshez, a
lawyer representing Service Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But Planning Commission President Mitchell B. Menzer noted that
"from what I'm hearing, there's a tremendous amount of animosity
toward your client."</TE>
<TE>   The new mausoleum will be 18 feet high and will have the same roof
line as an existing mausoleum. But there will be differences. It will
have a basement level reached by an elevator and, for the first time,
some crypts will face south, toward homes on Wellworth.</TE>
<TE>   Service Corp., which bought the property in 1996, bills itself as
the world's largest provider of funeral and burial services. In
fiscal 2001 it had revenues of more than $2.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company and its affiliates operate 2,507 funeral homes, 467
cemeteries and 154 crematoriums.</TE>

<HD>Husband Denies Attacks</HD>
<DH>Trial: Defense for the Simi Valley man's wife and
stepdaughter, who are charged with attempted murder, alleges he was
abusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley father denied allegations raised by defense lawyers in
court Thursday that he beat his wife and molested his teenage
stepdaughter.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Childs, 57, rejected accusations that he was an abusive
father and husband who lied on the witness stand to shield himself
from prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   And he stood by his earlier testimony that his wife and
stepdaughter attacked him with baseball bats on the morning of March
25 after his mattress caught fire.</LD>
<TE>   Eileen Childs, 37, and her daughter, Jennifer Childs, 19, are each
charged with attempted murder, arson and the use of deadly weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs also faces child-endangerment charges because her
sons, ages 9 and 11, were in the house at the time of the fire. And
she is charged with felony grand theft for allegedly stealing
$132,000 from her husband by forging his signature on an insurance
check.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend the mother-daughter duo conspired to kill
Larry Childs to collect on $1.4 million in life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys argue the women acted in self-defense,
saying Larry Childs grabbed both of them by the hair and dragged them
across the room.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, lawyers Jean Farley and Jenny Scovis tried to tarnish
Larry Childs' credibility and portray him as the aggressor.</TE>
<TE>   At one point Farley asked whether Childs attempted to have sexual
relations with his stepdaughter five years ago while the two were on
a trip to Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you ever try to kiss her breasts?" Farley asked during a
string of detailed questions about his alleged sexual advances.</TE>
<TE>   "No, ma'am," Childs responded flatly.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Scovis questioned whether Childs had demanded
sex from his wife following her chemotherapy treatments for lupus, a
chronic inflammatory disease. He denied it.</TE>
<TE>   Childs also denied screaming at his wife over finances and beating
his son with a belt. He rejected a suggestion his wife had put
herself between him and the children to protect them from abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "No, ma'am, that is not true," Childs responded, his voice raised
after hours of similar questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Childs acknowledged his wife had obtained a restraining order
against him after the March 25 incident.</TE>

<HD>His Clowning Around Leads Him to Big Top</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Kansas actor's dream comes true when
Ringling Bros. awards him a one-year contract at Anaheim audition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dean Kelly has dreamed of being a clown with the Greatest Show on
Earth ever since he was 4 years old, when his grandparents took him
to his first circus in Kansas City.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, his dream came true.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, 21, flew to California from Kansas City, Mo., when he
learned that Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey was holding its first
open auditions for clowns in 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   And after a tryout at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, where the
circus runs through Aug. 4, Kelly was offered a one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm blown away," Kelly said after shaking hands to seal the deal
with Tim Holst, vice president of production and talent for the
circus.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it. It's my lifelong dream and it's coming true.
It's just very overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly--who makes his living as an actor--was selected from about a
dozen circus clown wannabes who juggled, flipped, flopped and
performed magic in hopes of becoming part of the famous Ringling
Bros. Clown Alley.</TE>
<TE>   It was a little intimidating, he said, to perform in front of
judges who included David Larible, star of this year's circus;
Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, which owns and
produces the circus; and Phil McKinley, director of the circus.</TE>
<TE>   But something about Kelly's Midwestern boyish charm, bright yellow
hair and size 60 blue Converse sneakers caught McKinley's attention
almost immediately. And he liked Kelly's skit of a man whose picnic
is ruined by a buzzing bee.</TE>
<TE>   McKinley also saw promise in some of the others, including Leo
Christopher, 25, whose plaid suit, natural strawberry blond hair
under a bowler hat and smiling eyes conveyed "something that kids
would just fall in love with," McKinley said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, however, was the only one offered a contract.</TE>
<TE>   After 30 Years, Tryouts</TE>
<TE>   The circus hasn't held an audition for 30 years because it had
relied on the talent that emerged from Clown College. Based in
Venice, Fla., Clown College offered a rigorous 10-week training
program to amateurs in juggling, acrobatics, physical comedy, gag
construction and other skills.</TE>
<TE>   In 27 years, the college granted degrees in buffoonery to more
than 1,700 performers, including Penn Gillette of the comedy
illusionist team Penn and Teller. But the college closed several
years ago and Ringling Bros. producers thought the Los Angeles area
would be a good place to find some professional clowns.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking for clowns, talented performers," said
Barbara Pflughaupt, a spokeswoman for the circus. But spotting that
indefinable something that makes a clown takes a practiced eye, said
Larible.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't learn to be a clown," he said. "You're either a clown
or you're not."</TE>
<TE>   Larible said he looks for spontaneity, sweetness, harmony and
precision in a clown's movements.</TE>
<TE>   It Takes Heart</TE>
<TE>   Feld also tries to spot what can't be gleaned in a resume.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I want them to be funny," he said, "but I try to look past
the makeup to see what their heart looks like. I want people who want
to make a difference in young people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Finding that blend is no laughing matter.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, the wide-eyed kid from Kansas, couldn't agree more. He has
studied clowns since he was 4, was vice president of the Clowns of
America, Alley 92, in Kansas, and hasn't missed a circus in 17
years--"I have the programs to prove it."</TE>
<TE>   As the hopefuls went through their gags in the center ring,
McKinley cast a serious eye over the clowns and observed: "Comedy is
serious business, and clowning is the most serious of them all."</TE>

<HD>Long-Lasting Love: A Chance to Redo the 'I Do'</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: 15 couples renew their vows after at least 50
years of marriage. The yellow ribbon goes to twosome who wed 71 years
ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time Paul McKinzie saw Bonnie Collins, he was smitten.</LD>
<LD>   Bonnie, then 8 years old, was playing a Hawaiian steel guitar solo
at the Church of God in Santa Ana when 11-year-old Paul felt that
funny feeling in the pit of his stomach. He was hooked. He was in
love.</LD>
<LD>   "I turned to my friend and I told him, 'That's the little Bonnie
that I'm going to marry,' " McKinzie, 68, said with a smile as he
patted his wife's shoulder Thursday during a special visit to the
Orange County Fair. "How do you describe a feeling of completeness? I
felt in my heart that God wanted me to marry this girl."</LD>
<TE>   The McKinzies were married during a two-day wedding celebration a
few years later in 1952, when she was 15 and he was 18.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly 50 years later, the McKinzies joined 14 other couples to
renew their vows and mark at least their golden wedding anniversary
on the Heritage Stage at the fair.</TE>
<TE>   The gentle sound of Hawaiian melodies played by the Oasis Senior
Center musicians from Corona del Mar filled the air as family members
and fairgoers gathered to watch the eager couples exchange their
vows.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing them up there is so wonderful," said Linda Mandelbaum of
her father Donald Lipman, 72, and mother Jerelaine, 70, standing
onstage holding hands. "This is like a moment in time that I'll never
forget--it's a moment of total innocence, commitment and complete
love." Chaplain Edmund Werner from Orangewood Children's Home, decked
out in a gray top hat and tuxedo, asked the seniors their secret for
a lasting marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Love each other and don't go to bed mad," said Myrtle Almquist,
83, as she smiled at husband Forrest, 87. The Almquists have been
celebrating their marriage at the fair for 15 years--ever since their
50th anniversary in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   As many of the couples danced, Kathryn and Harry Rathbourn quietly
enjoyed their cake at the side of the stage. Married 71 years, the
Rathbourns received this year's yellow ribbon for the longest
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   While sipping apple cider, Kathryn recalled the day she met Harry
at a dance hall they frequented as teenagers and the struggles they
faced as Harry's naval unit was shipped off during World War II and
the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very hard, but we communicated a lot and worked hard,"
Kathryn said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after more than a lifetime together, the Rathbourns still
held hands and looked like newlyweds as they shared their cake.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like Mikey--he eats everything," Kathryn teased. "We just
get along and respect each other."</TE>
<TE>   In a time where 20% of first marriages end in divorce within five
years, the 15 couples had a lot to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Looking like two teenagers in love, Paul and Bonnie McKinzie
kissed and hugged as they danced to the tune "Let Me Call You
Sweetheart."</TE>
<TE>   "The only time I'm really happy is when I see her happy," Paul
said. "God truly gave me an angel."</TE>

<HD>Halaco Seeks Bankruptcy Protection</HD>
<DH>Courts: Oxnard recycling firm files for Chapter 11. But
critics say it's trying to avoid an environmental lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halaco Engineering, an Oxnard metal recycling plant under fire by
regulators, has filed for bankruptcy protection in a move that
critics charge is designed to hold up an environmental lawsuit
against the company.</LD>
<LD>   The Chapter 11 petition, filed this week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Santa Barbara, would allow the company to continue operating while
seeking protection from creditors--and plaintiffs in civil
lawsuits--as it reorganizes its structure and finances.</LD>
<LD>   A bankruptcy lawyer for Halaco said a lawsuit filed last year by
the Santa Barbara-based environmental group Channelkeeper has
strapped the company's resources to the point that bankruptcy
protection was its only option. The federal lawsuit alleges that the
company is releasing toxic materials into the air and water.</LD>
<TE>   "When you're taking the managers away from the operation of the
business and making them focus their time and energies on depositions
and production of documents and hearings, it's very difficult," said
attorney Lawrence Peitzman.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Bohan, Channelkeeper's executive director, said Halaco's
filing came as the group was preparing to ask a federal judge to rule
in its favor. Channelkeeper must now convince a judge to let the case
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "It throws a huge wrench into the works," Bohan said of Halaco's
move. "It's consistent with the way the company operates."</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme resident and City Council candidate Maricela Morales,
who lives blocks from the smelting plant, urged the environmental
group to challenge the bankruptcy protection filing.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of what we are seeing on the national level with larger
corporations," she said, "I think it's all the more important not to
allow Halaco to get away with using another tactic to avoid taking
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Plant manager Dave Gable said Halaco is in financial straits and
had no other option.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of strategy to bankruptcy," Gable said. "We
hope to be able to stay in business."</TE>
<TE>   Court documents show that Halaco owes at least $239,000 in
lawyers' fees and $168,000 to other companies with which it does
business.</TE>
<TE>   Gable declined to discuss company finances Thursday, but in an
interview two years ago he told The Times that Halaco employed 50
people and had $10 million in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   Peitzman, the Los Angeles attorney representing Halaco in the
bankruptcy proceedings, said that without bankruptcy protection,
Halaco was concerned it could not continue complying with demands set
forth earlier this year by the Regional Water Quality Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   "The company believes it can work its way through this situation
and emerge from Chapter 11 in compliance with governmental
regulations and serving its customers," Peitzman said. "The company's
in the recycling business. It's an environmentally friendly company."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Krop, chief counsel for the Environmental Defense Center in
Santa Barbara, co-plaintiffs in the Channelkeeper suit, put no stock
in Halaco's contention that the lawsuit brought the company to its
knees.</TE>
<TE>   "We filed the lawsuit a year and a half ago, and they could have
spent their money addressing the concerns and cleaning up their
facility," Krop said.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead, they decided to spend their money on lawyers and
obstructing our case every step of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Halaco set up shop in 1970 on 41 acres at Oxnard's southern tip.
Nearby, Ormond Beach's wetlands are home to protected species
including the tidewater goby and the California least tern.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, millions of pounds of aluminum and magnesium scrap are
melted at the plant. The recycled product is sold to soda bottlers
and car companies. What is left is pumped into waste ponds and then
accrues on slag heaps that have grown to 40 feet high.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors have long complained of foul smells and black soot. The
company also has tangled for decades with regulators, consistently
defending its right to operate.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency sued in 1980, alleging that
waste was being discharged into the wetlands, but the state Supreme
Court ultimately ruled in Halaco's favor.</TE>
<TE>   The California Coastal Commission also lost a bid in the 1980s to
impose stricter regulations on the company. In 1992, the EPA
identified heavy metals from the site leaking onto Ormond Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the company has sued officials with the Ventura
County Air Pollution Control District and threatened legal action
against members of the Regional Water Quality Control Board if
members acted in a way that the company believed to be overreaching.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the water board said it had evidence that ammonia
and other toxic chemicals were seeping into the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Channelkeeper filed its lawsuit. Then in March of this
year, the Regional Water Quality Control Board imposed tighter
restrictions on the company, including an order that Halaco stop
adding to its slag heap by the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said it will be able to do so with new filtration
equipment it has purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Dickerson, the water board's executive officer, said the
bankruptcy filing should not affect that agreement.</TE>

<HD>Online Access to Risky Sex</HD>
<DH>The Internet opens up a universe of possibilities for gay
men seeking casual trysts. Some officials see a public health
nightmare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year after testing positive for HIV, a 40-year-old entertainment
publicist returns time and again to the "bathhouse" in his backyard.
Inside a cinder-block shed, with jazz blaring in the background, he
taps away at a computer, trolling for sexual partners.</LD>
<LD>   His bathhouse is the Internet, specifically the Los Angeles chat
room of Gay.com, a wildly popular Web site that offers flirtatious
banter, personal ads and the opportunity to quickly turn virtual
encounters into real-life sex.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you looking to hook up now?" the man writes to a potential
partner. Within minutes, the two have traded details of their
favorite sexual exploits, swapped photographs and promised to meet
later that day.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, the publicist met another guy the same way. During
sex, the condom broke. That's how he says he caught the AIDS virus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like playing Russian roulette," he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. "I got the bullet."</TE>
<TE>   He is not playing alone. Gay and bisexual men looking for
quick-turnaround sex increasingly are turning to the Internet, and
they are doing so at far greater rates than their heterosexual
counterparts. As a result, public-health experts say, they are
speeding the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The same accessibility and anonymity that make the Web so popular
also make it increasingly dangerous to sex-seeking users, multiplying
"the probability of high-risk people meeting high-risk people," said
Colorado epidemiologist John Potterat. Sex-oriented chat rooms could
become "the EBay of homosexual sex," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sex among men has long accounted for a large share of sexually
transmitted diseases--42% of AIDS cases nationally, for example, and
more than 80% of syphilis cases in San Francisco in the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, officials tried to control the spread of such
diseases among gays by targeting common meeting places: closing
bathhouses in the 1980s, or requiring condom distribution at bars and
adult bookstores.</TE>
<TE>   Now, just as research is suggesting that many gay men are tiring
of safer-sex practices, the Internet is opening up a sexual
superhighway.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials are woefully ill-equipped to respond. Closing it
off or passing out condoms isn't an option. Moreover, the Web can be
an inviting venue for men who don't typically go to bars or
bathhouses and perhaps wouldn't otherwise engage in high-risk sex.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have no means of systematically monitoring the sites, no
new money to launch prevention campaigns and no power to trace
infections by demanding that Internet companies identify their
clients.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not keeping up," said Dr. Peter Kerndt, director of
sexually transmitted disease control for Los Angeles County. Worse
than that, "we have little sense of what approaches would be
effective."</TE>
<TE>   No one knows the precise number of gay men who go online searching
for anonymous sex, but judging from use of chat rooms and personal ad
sites, it's a significant subset of the gay population.</TE>
<TE>   Gay.com reported nearly 17.7 million chat sessions in April, up
from just 4 million sessions in January 1999. At any given time, up
to 18,000 people around the world are conversing in Gay.com's chat
rooms. The provider, which markets its ability to help men find "Mr.
Right" and "Mr. Right Now," says 150,000 members sign on to the chat
rooms every day.</TE>
<TE>   Gay.com executives say their site voluntarily provides information
on safe sex. But they say they are not responsible for unsafe sex any
more than the telephone company is for prank calls.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get [a disease] while chatting with somebody on the
Internet," said Lowell Selvin, CEO of PlanetOut Partners, parent
company of Gay.com. "You have to physically show up and interact. At
that time, you're governed by rules that are far beyond the scope of
our organization."</TE>
<TE>   The sex-seekers are not only showing up for their trysts,
physicians say, they are landing in clinics with infections--notably
in California, which has both a large gay population and a high rate
of Internet use.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Cohan, a Beverly Hills physician whose practice treats
2,500 HIV-positive patients, said that as many as 30% meet sex
partners online. "That number is rising," he said, "as people find
that it's an efficient, easy, 24-hour way that they can meet people
without having to brush their teeth or comb their hair."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to beat the convenience. And many men like the idea of
skipping the small talk at bars and dance clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "You just jump in and you connect, you hook up," said the
publicist, who has a live-in boyfriend. "It's the fastest way to have
sex."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in his ornate living room in San Francisco's largely gay
Castro district, travel agency owner Jonathan Klein expresses hope
that chat rooms will bring about a rebirth of sexual exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "There hasn't been enough acknowledgment of the fact that the
sexual freedom of the '70s was for a lot of people a really, really
wonderful thing," said Klein, 50, who has lived in San Francisco for
28 years.</TE>
<TE>   Klein, who is HIV positive, said he uses the Internet to search
for other HIV-positive men with whom he can have unprotected anal
intercourse. Because of his HIV status, Klein said he is willing to
accept the consequences of unprotected sex, including other sexually
transmitted diseases besides HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he got syphilis--a "minor inconvenience," according to
Klein. It was treatable with antibiotics, he said, and won't cause
permanent health problems because he sought treatment early on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not a wake-up call," he said. "I don't intend to
change."</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary research suggests there are lots of men like Klein.
Studies have found that gay and bisexual men are two to three times
as likely as heterosexual men to seek sexual partners online.</TE>
<TE>   It's a high-stakes gamble.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Colorado, Kentucky and Maine, among other states,
public-health officials have traced outbreaks of sexually transmitted
diseases to chat room meetings. In San Francisco, 18% of the gay and
bisexual men diagnosed with early forms of syphilis last year said
they had found sex partners on the Internet. In Los Angeles County,
the figure was 13%.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet makes for speedier transmission of disease over a
wider area. If a New Yorker plans to visit Denver next week, he can
go online and make plans to meet a sex partner the evening he
arrives. At a gay bar in a strange city, hookups are likely to be
less certain and take more time.</TE>
<TE>   Many gay men have been quick to embrace the Internet because they
are technologically savvy and appreciate the privacy it affords.</TE>
<TE>   But pursuing sex on the Internet also is popular with gay males
because, it is believed among evolutionary psychologists, that men in
general are more interested in casual sex. Erick Janssen, an
associate scientist at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex,
Gender and Reproduction in Indiana, said he believes heterosexual men
would seek sexual liaisons via the Internet far more if not for the
comparatively low level of interest among women.</TE>
<TE>   Gay leaders say research shows that the majority of gay men don't
engage in behaviors that place them at risk for HIV.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to focus on the men who are engaging in anonymous sex ...
but we don't focus on those men who are in committed relationships,"
said Jeff Bailey, director of health education and prevention at the
Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center.</TE>
<TE>   For those who are seeking casual sex, however, the Internet may
foster less candor and caution.</TE>
<TE>   "People may be a little less honest about their HIV status and
people may loosen up about what they're willing to do because there's
a lot of fantasy and role play involved," said Cohan, the Beverly
Hills AIDS doctor.</TE>
<TE>   A 39-year-old photographer in San Francisco says he is living with
the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "I was operating with invincibility, thinking that I'm good enough
at making judgment calls about a person by looking at them and
defining the state of their health," he said. "How stupid is that?"</TE>
<TE>   Now he has HIV, probably acquired, he says, through an encounter
with a man he met on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The photographer doesn't blame the Web sites. In his mind, the
real problem is promiscuity among some gay men. They will "connect
for sex anywhere they possibly can, and believe me, I mean anywhere,"
he said. "Give them the opportunity to create a 'cruise' spot
somewhere and it will be done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1999, San Francisco health authorities received
some disturbing reports: Men were contracting syphilis after meeting
partners on America Online's user chat room, San Francisco M4M (men
for men).</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, the city's sexually transmitted disease
controller, had never heard of anything like this. Nor had any of his
colleagues in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of disease investigators, Klausner linked seven
men's infections to an overlapping network of 99 recent sexual
partners. One of the infected men had 47 partners.</TE>
<TE>   Public-health staff and volunteers spent hours in AOL's chat rooms
alerting users to the outbreak, providing facts about syphilis and
encouraging testing. They also sent e-mails to partners for whom
patients had contact information.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, fewer than half of the seven men's sexual partners
were notified and tested--illustrating the pitfalls of fighting
Internet-fueled outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   Internet users commonly know each other only by computer screen
names, and those can change on a daily basis, making partner
notification difficult. And Internet providers including AOL won't
release the real identities of users unless required by a court order
or if they determine that there is an immediate threat to life, such
as suicide or homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Klausner has been pressuring AOL to post syphilis warnings in its
San Francisco chat rooms ever since the 1999 syphilis
outbreak--without success. Instead, AOL offered to provide
complimentary AOL accounts to Klausner's staffers so they could warn
members themselves.</TE>
<TE>   AOL spokesman Nicholas Graham said the company offers a wealth of
educational resources on its health channel, and it has run public
service announcements about sexually transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Other Internet companies say they are cooperating fully with
health authorities. The San Francisco health department pays Gay.com
to run banner advertisements in its West Coast chat rooms and
arranges for Klausner to answer users' questions.</TE>
<TE>   Some in San Francisco's gay community liken Klausner's efforts to
the forced closing of the city's bathhouses in 1984. Klein said a
shutdown of chat rooms would be "totally unacceptable." Klausner said
he isn't trying to close chat rooms, only to make them safer.</TE>
<TE>   HIV prevention groups, meanwhile, are resorting to their own
piecemeal tactics.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, Karl Knapper and volunteers from the nonprofit
agency Stop AIDS visit Gay.com's Bay Area chat rooms several times a
week to answer questions about safer sex and HIV prevention. In all,
Knapper, who directs Web outreach for the group, and his volunteers
talked to 3,000 people online last year.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't have any way of knowing how many of them took the
group's advice to heart. He doesn't regret trying, though.</TE>
<TE>   "If people miss the boat on the Internet," Knapper said, "they'll
miss the boat on a whole population that's at risk for HIV infection.
By the time they do realize it, it will be too late."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans resident Keith Griffith, 43, who founded one of the
nation's first casual sex Web sites almost seven years ago, has no
qualms about his line of work.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing that makes me happier than when I get an e-mail
message from some guy out there who told me about the great sex he's
had as a result of my Web site," he said. "That is the reason my Web
site exists."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith says the site has 60,000 individual sign-ons every day.
He doesn't charge users for reading, posting or replying to messages;
he makes his money selling advertisements and sexual paraphernalia.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith says public-health agencies don't understand the nature
of people who use the Web site. "The simple fact is that some people
are going to choose to have unsafe sex, and they're not necessarily
bad people or stupid people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another site, one that promotes unprotected sex, takes a
provocative approach to the question of safety. "What about AIDS and
HIV?" the site owners write. "What about it?? It will still exist if
we have this site up or not. It's up to you (remember, you are an
adult, aren't you) to decide how you want to run your life ... whom
you infect, and what you even believe."</TE>
<TE>   Those who run more mainstream gay sites say they serve many
purposes besides instant sex. Bryce Eberhart, a spokesman for
Gay.com, points to "success stories" like Nicholas Picard, who met
his boyfriend of 11 months through Gay.com's personals service.
Picard, 23, said the Internet has allowed introverts like him to find
partners who aren't looking for anonymous sexual hookups.</TE>
<TE>   But finding a relationship-oriented guy online was difficult,
Picard admitted.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was first coming out, I felt like a piece of meat with
vultures descending on me," said the software engineer who works for
a military-related company. "If someone asks you online, 'Do you want
to meet?' you know what they want. I don't get the mentality. It
drives me nuts."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owner of a Beverly Hills jewelry store who shot and killed an
intruder Thursday told police the man was holding a gun to his head
when he reached for his own and fired repeatedly.</LD>
<LD>   Police responded about 1:30 p.m. to reports of gunshots at Mirage
Jewelers on 9469 Little Santa Monica Blvd., said Beverly Hills Police
Lt. Gary Gilmond.</LD>
<LD>   Officers entered the store and found the body just inside the
entrance and the owner standing behind a counter, police said. Police
said the owner told them that the man had drawn a gun from his
waistband and led him around the otherwise empty store. At one point,
the gunman pointed his weapon at the owner's head, the jeweler told
police. The owner "drew his own handgun" and "fired on the suspect
multiple times, striking him on the upper torso," Gilmond said.
Police did not identify either man.</LD>
<TE>   The result of a police investigation will be submitted to district
attorney prosecutors for review.</TE>

<HD>Travel at LAX Hits 6-Year Low</HD>
<DH>Flying: About 6 million fewer people passed through the
airport from January through June than did last year. Slashed
schedules and long lines are blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recovery in passenger traffic that began at Los Angeles
International Airport earlier this year has stalled and the number of
travelers using the facility is at a six-year low, according to
statistics compiled by the city agency that operates LAX.</LD>
<LD>   The situation isn't likely to improve, city officials said, until
airlines resume flights canceled after Sept. 11. But carriers said
they won't do so until more people start flying.</LD>
<LD>   About 27 million people traveled through LAX between January and
June, down from nearly 33 million in the same period last year. It's
the least traffic at the airport since the first half of 1996, when
28 million passengers used the facility, statistics show.</LD>
<TE>   The decline has pushed airport concession and parking revenues
lower, but higher landing fees and reduced spending in areas other
than security have offset those decreases, airport officials say.</TE>
<TE>   LAX isn't alone. Most of the nation's major airports have been
unable to shake the aftereffects of the terrorist attacks. People
continue to shy away from air travel because of inconvenient new
security measures. Business travel, the airlines' bread and butter,
has also been stubbornly slow.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is recovering very nicely, I'm afraid," said Paul
McKnight, who manages the air service practice at the John F. Brown
Co., an aviation consulting firm. "In November, December and January,
things were coming back , but around March everything started to
stagnate." No improvement has been seen since, he said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX and San Francisco International Airport are suffering larger
declines than other major airports--traffic is down 17% for the year
at each facility--which means that both slipped in worldwide
rankings. LAX is now the world's fifth busiest airport--down from
third--and SFO is 21st, a drop from 15th.</TE>
<TE>   The declines are largely the results of schedule reductions by
major carriers at each airport after the hijackings. LAX's largest
airline, United, cut its schedule last fall to 104 flights a day, 74
fewer than it had planned. Today, the carrier has about 121 daily
flights from LAX, and it isn't likely to add any soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is a very important hub for us," said Chris
Brathwaite, an airline spokesman. "But you don't typically add
bunches of flights back when people aren't flying."</TE>
<TE>   Schedule reductions by United and others led LAX to chart 338
fewer flights a day in June than in June 2001. With fewer flights,
most departing planes are 78% full, leaving many passengers to
conclude that the airlines' fortunes are improving.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of travelers have the mistaken impression that they just
got off a flight and it's full so those guys must be OK," said David
Swierenga, chief economist for the Air Transport Assn., an airline
industry trade group. "But what they don't see is that there are a
lot of planes that are sitting on the ground, not being used."</TE>
<TE>   The drop in passengers at LAX is harming businesses around the
airport that rely on travelers. "With lower traffic counts we don't
have the same number of people eating at restaurants and staying in
hotels around the airport," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the
county Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The one bright spot in statistics released this week is a gain in
freight traveling through LAX. Tonnage climbed 4% in May and 5% in
June, a sign that some lucrative international trade is starting to
return to LAX, Kyser said.</TE>
<TE>   Other airports have fared somewhat better than LAX and SFO for the
first part of the year. At Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport,
the world's busiest, traffic fell by just 7% for January through May
compared with 2001. O'Hare International Airport in Chicago saw
declines of 10%, and traffic at John F. Kennedy International Airport
in New York was down 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Travel at Ontario International Airport, operated by the city
agency that runs LAX, fell 8.3% from January through June of this
year, statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, airports that rely on discount carriers, which have
weathered the effects of the terrorist attacks better than major
airlines, are seeing passenger traffic recover more quickly than it
has for their larger counterparts. Many travelers prefer these
facilities for their shorter lines and at least a perception of
greater security.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger traffic at Burbank Airport for the first six months of
2002 was down 4.4% when compared with the first half of 2001. At John
Wayne Airport in Orange County, traffic climbed 2.3% from January
through June. Long Beach Airport, which gained 10 daily flights over
the same period last year thanks to upstart JetBlue and American
Airlines, posted an enormous 61% jump in travelers.</TE>

<HD>The Immigration Bomb: Bill Simon, Are You Listening?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I can't bear to watch this any longer. Republican Bill Simon is
running against a Democratic governor nobody likes, and the poor soul
can't get out of his own way.</LD>
<LD>   He's tried passing himself off as an environmentalist while
blasting California's tailpipe emissions legislation, and he's mugged
as a can-do businessman while the IRS investigates a possible tax
shelter in his family's company.</LD>
<LD>   Toss in the fact that Simon's thimble-full of fresh ideas is
running low, and former Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan
Lungren is beginning to look like Abe Lincoln.</LD>
<TE>   But it's still early, and Gray Davis is capable of getting caught
shaking down old ladies for bingo winnings. And it just so happens
I've got an idea that could bring Bill Simon back from the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the time for the challenger to take ownership of one issue
that's on the mind of virtually every resident of California but is
taboo as a campaign topic. I refer, of course, to the state's insane
population growth. And, yes, I'm talking about slowing down
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Take just about any problem in California and the chief cause goes
unmentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Education is a disaster. Traffic is a nightmare. We've got a water
supply crisis. The housing shortage is chronic. The health-care
system is so overwhelmed ambulances often can't unload emergency room
patients. Our shore is so polluted, Southern California leads the
nation in beach closures.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because 34 million people live here, and we're growing by one
person every minute.</TE>
<TE>   California has been uniquely enriched by immigration in every way.
Culturally, economically, socially.</TE>
<TE>   But if we don't have enough schools today--and many of the
existing ones are teaching phonics to high school students, for
crying out loud--how big of a black hole will we fall into when the
population hits an anticipated 50 million in 2025?</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be a right-wing, knuckle-dragging kook to ask
such questions.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Hull, president of Californians for Population
Stabilization, calls herself an environmentalist, and the 4,000
members of CAPS come in various political stripes. Overpopulation is
the world's problem, says Hull, an anti-sprawl Republican who
supports sex education and family planning. But in the United States,
it's mostly California's problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty percent of the country's 1.5 million immigrants each year,
both legal and illegal, come to California," she says, and virtually
all of California's population growth is from foreign rather than
domestic migration.</TE>
<TE>   The reason everyone's afraid to talk about this, of course, is
Proposition 187 and former Gov. Pete Wilson's ham-handed,
anti-immigrant, "They keep coming" TV ads in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of leading a responsible discussion about population
growth and services for immigrants, the Republican governor incited a
race war that drew all the bigots out of their cages.</TE>
<TE>   And ever since, Republicans have been in damage control, some of
them even learning a few palabras en Espanol and coming frighteningly
close to donning sombreros.</TE>
<TE>   But Hull has a news flash.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Bill Simon and the Republicans are being very dumb on
this issue. First of all, they're never going to get the Hispanic
vote. They could stand on their heads and they're not going to get
it. And 187 would pass again today. Every poll in the last six to
eight years indicates that people are with us" on slowing
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   There is to date no evidence that Bill Simon is capable of
finesse. But I talked to a GOP consultant who suggested that Simon
frame the argument in terms of preserving the standing of recent
immigrants rather than issuing a Pat Buchanan-like call for Mounties
to lock and load and ride to the borders.</TE>
<TE>   The shaky economy makes the timing all the better.</TE>
<TE>   The issue isn't color, but sheer population growth. Hull says
working-class Californians of all colors feel threatened by growing
competition for their jobs, especially if the competitors, no matter
what color, are willing to work for less.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the issue presents another conflict for the
Republicans, who represent agricultural and business interests that
can never get enough cheap labor, legal or otherwise. Or, if he
wanted to take a different tack, Simon could argue for corralling
sprawl, although he might have trouble mustering the courage to
alienate developers by arguing that California has already been built
out beyond reason.</TE>
<TE>   But it has been built out beyond reason. The tired, the poor, the
huddled masses are all coming to California, and we're swimming in
dung off the coast of Orange County, for God's sake. What better
place to talk about it than in a campaign for governor?</TE>
<TE>   I called the Simon campaign to ask that very question, as a matter
of fact. Unfortunately, if Simon doesn't seem to have any clue why
he's running for governor, he's managed by a team of stooges who
couldn't answer him if he asked. They never called back.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon is missing a tremendous opportunity," says John Gizzy
of Human Events, a conservative weekly. Gizzy figures the candidate
is fearful of cutting in on President Bush's courtship dance with
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Gizzy and Hull say the events of Sept. 11 make it all the more
imperative, and all the easier politically, to talk about immigration
controls. States can't provide the services the federal government
requires them to, says Hull, so what's wrong with demanding that we
quit the Border Patrol charade and get honest about stopping illegal
immigration?</TE>
<TE>   "Every courageous politician has to take the lead on an issue and
take a hit," says Gizzy.</TE>
<TE>   How much courage does it take? I'm talking about doing the
responsible thing and initiating an obvious and important
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   What's Bill Simon got to lose?</TE>

<HD>Bail Reduced for Educator Accused of Molesting Girl</HD>
<DH>Courts: The former Westlake Village principal is no threat
to other young females, his lawyer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bail was reduced Thursday for a former Westlake Village middle school
principal accused of molesting a 13-year-old female student whose
family he had befriended.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Andreas, 36, who will be charged Aug. 6 with 15 counts of
lewd behavior with a child, saw his bail cut to $250,000 from
$500,000, which was set when he was arrested Saturday in Thousand
Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   He could receive a maximum sentence of 36 years in prison if
convicted of all charges.</LD>
<TE>   During a bail review hearing Thursday, his attorney, Robert
Schwartz, portrayed Andreas as a popular, well-respected educator
whose friends and supporters rallied around him.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very highly regarded by staff and students at school,
wherever he taught," Schwartz told Superior Court Judge Kevin J.
McGee. Schwartz said Andreas' mother, who lives in Cerritos, was
deluged with supportive phone calls from students and colleagues at
Oaks Christian Middle School, where Andreas was director, and at
private and public schools in Pacific Palisades and Bellflower, where
he had taught.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz said Andreas was not a threat to other girls and that his
contact with the girl he is accused of molesting was "situational"
because of his friendship with her Thousand Oaks family, whom he met
through the school.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor Douglas Ridley said after the hearing that Andreas
had significant sexual contact with the girl, short of intercourse,
from June 21 to July 1.</TE>
<TE>   He said several acts took place at different locations, with the
final incident occurring at Andreas' home in Thousand Oaks. The
prosecutor said in court that investigators found written plans
describing what Andreas would do if caught.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas was fired by Oaks Christian on Tuesday after his arrest
became public.</TE>

<HD>Secession Foes Tap Execs for War Chest</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Campaign filings show Mayor Hahn's L.A. United
has raised almost $2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tapping some of the city's wealthy and powerful business interests,
Mayor James K. Hahn has raised nearly $2 million this year for his
campaign to defeat measures that would break off the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's L.A. United campaign collected $1.93 million in the
first six months of the year, with $1.87 million still on hand at the
end of June for an expected all-out campaign against the twin
secession proposals. Those measures will appear on the Nov. 5 ballot.
To win, they must carry a majority of the voters in each area, as
well as a majority of voters citywide.</LD>
<LD>   None of the groups supporting secession have filed campaign
contribution reports. But Anne Dunsmore, fund-raiser for the
organizations promoting Valley and Hollywood secession, said they had
raised $300,000 by last week. She said Hollywood club owner Gene
LaPietra gave $70,000 and Ferris Wehbe, former president of Hollywood
VOTE, gave $23,000.</LD>
<TE>   Leaders of those efforts said Thursday that the concentration of
money fighting secession reflects the determination of powerful
interests to hold onto their influence in the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In papers filed Thursday with the city Ethics Commission, Hahn's
group showed that it received money from interests with a vital stake
in what happens at City Hall. They include city employee unions,
developers, law firms, banks and companies that do business with the
city, particularly at the airport and port.</TE>
<TE>   By far the biggest contribution--$250,000--came from Majestic
Realty Co., headed by Ed Roski, one of the builders of the Staples
Center and promoter of a plan for a hotel, retail and entertainment
complex adjacent to the arena. Roski also was a principal in a
now-dormant proposal to build a football stadium downtown. Hahn has
embraced both projects and offered the city's assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Roski was among those who attended Hahn's anti-secession
fund-raiser last month at the posh City Club downtown. At that time,
Roski explained that keeping the city together is one of the most
important issues of his lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "We support the city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A San Fernando Valley resident, Roski said it would be a big
mistake for voters to split off from Los Angeles and create another
layer of government. He vowed to be active in the campaign against
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Billionaires Eli Broad, who made much of his money in home
building and retirement services; and Jerry Perenchio, chairman of
Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language broadcast network,
gave $100,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   BP Corp., which acquired Los Angeles-based Arco, and Casden
Properties, a Westside developer, also gave $100,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   At a downtown campaign event Wednesday evening, Hahn said
intensive fund-raising is necessary to ensure that the city stays
together. The mayor said that the companies and individuals
contributing to the effort against secession have a big stake in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "What's at stake here is very sizable for the whole future of the
city," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy concentration of dollars from major business interests
immediately sparked criticism from secession backers.</TE>
<TE>   "This confirms there is a relatively small group of very powerful
interests from downtown Los Angeles who want to hold on to power,"
said Richard Katz, chairman of the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee. "They will spend any amount of money to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Katz said voters should ask themselves: Do they really think
people "contributing a quarter of a million dollars or $100,000 a
pop" have their best interests at heart?</TE>
<TE>   The roster of contributors to the L.A. United campaign includes a
number of major Los Angeles developers. Douglas Ring, the husband of
City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, gave $50,000. Catellus
Development Corp., which built the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's downtown headquarters, contributed $25,000. So did Robert
Voit, a principal builder of Warner Center and the city's new office
tower in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   The developers of the Playa Vista project on the city's Westside
gave $25,000 and downtown developer Maguire Partners gave $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign against the breakup also received large contributions
from organized labor, which is fighting secession partly because of
concern that a new Valley city might contract out work or cut
payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   Labor contributions included $50,000 from the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents many city
Department of Water and Power employees, $25,000 from the Southern
California District Council of Laborers, and $10,000 each from the
Los Angeles Professional Managers Assn. and United Teachers of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Two major concessionaires at Los Angeles International Airport
that recently received extensions of their leases from Hahn's
appointees on the city's Airport Commission each gave $25,000. W.H.
Smith operates newsstands and bookstores and HMS Host is the largest
operator of food and beverage concessions at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession campaign also received $5,000 checks from the
City Hall lobbying firm Rose &amp; Kindel, whose client list includes
Playa Vista, HMS Host and United Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Other lobbyists contributing to the mayor's effort include Clark
Davis and Ron Gastelum.</TE>
<TE>   Several major San Fernando Valley companies contributed heavily to
the anti-secession effort. Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp., one of
the nation's biggest construction firms, gave $50,000, as did Zenith
Insurance Co. of Woodland Hills. Biotech businessman Alfred Mann of
Sylmar, who received city help opening new facilities in the Valley,
gave $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also collected $20,000 from P &amp; O Nedlloyd, a New
Jersey-based international shipping company that ships about 300,000
containers annually through the Port of Los Angeles, according to
company executive R.A. Agresti.</TE>
<TE>   The firm uses a wharf leased from the city by another shipping
firm, NYK, he said. It decided to get involved in the cityhood
campaign because of concern that a divided Los Angeles could hurt the
local economy and affect the firm's business.</TE>
<TE>   Other contributors include public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard
Inc., which gave $10,000. The City Council this month gave the
company an $800,000 extension on a $15.3-million multiyear contract
to provide marketing and advertising for the city DWP.</TE>
<TE>   The extension lasts through Sept. 30, but the firm is one of the
bidders for a new, one-year contract to provide the same services to
the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   That contract could be worth about $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's committee also received $5,000 from developer Christopher
Hammond, whose firm Capital Vision Equities is relying on City Hall
for funding of projects.</TE>
<TE>   The firm was part of a partnership that received a $2.8-million
city loan in 2000 to build a 56-unit housing project in Lake View
Terrace.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Hahn reported the first contributions to the
anti-secession effort. HNTB Corp. gave $25,000. The firm recently won
a contract to plan for the expansion of city-owned Ontario
International Airport. Public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard gave
$5,000.</TE>

<LD>U.S. District Judge David O. Carter sentenced an Orange County
physician on Monday to more than eight years in prison for supplying
a drug dealer with drugs to make methamphetamine.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Fredesminda Yabut-Baluyut, 60, was also ordered to pay a
$150,000 fine. She was convicted of selling nearly 12 million
pseudoephedrine tablets out of her Fountain Valley home.</LD>
<LD>   The pills are a cold medication. They are regulated because they
contain an ingredient used in making methamphetamine.</LD>
<TE>   Yabut-Baluyut used her medical license to order the generic
tablets from an East Coast pharmaceutical company in 1997 and 1998,
then supplied them to drug dealer Joseph F. Hasrouty, Assistant U.S.
Atty. Richard J. Cutler said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Yabut-Baluyut received less than $100,000 from the sales.</TE>
<TE>   Hasrouty, 45, of North Hollywood, pleaded guilty to possession of
the tablets in 1999 but fled before sentencing.</TE>

<LD>A portion of Katella Avenue at Douglass Road was closed Thursday
afternoon after a tear in a sewage line caused the pavement to
buckle. Crews dug a 15-foot-by-15-foot hole to repair the line. The
buckling was causing by dirt being drawn into the tear, officials
said, but no sewage leaked.</LD>
<LD>   The work lasted several hours and caused a tie-up for fans leaving
the Angels game at Anaheim Stadium, as well as for those arriving for
the evening's performance of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey
circus at the Arrowhead Pond, and rush-hour commuters using the
Katella Avenue onramp to the Orange Freeway.</LD>

<HD>Baby Drive Wraps Infants in White Supremacy</HD>

<LD>Here's some news to make you feel all warm and fuzzy about your
world: White babies around the country are receiving white clothing
from white people.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the Aryan Baby Drive that operates from a Costa Mesa
post office box, white supremacists are showing their generosity in
wonderful ways. They even have a Web site that encourages others to
give, give, give.</LD>
<LD>   Who says you never read any good news?</LD>
<TE>   Just listen to these testimonials:</TE>
<TE>   "The failing global economy hit our family pretty hard. At about
the same time, our toddler hit one of those amazing growth spurts and
began to outgrow everything we had. Unsure of when our next paycheck
was coming and not knowing what to do, the Aryan Baby Drive was right
there to help us ... Thanks. Anonymous."</TE>
<TE>   Here's another thank-you, this one from "the Bostwick Family" in
an undisclosed community: "When I was carrying our third child, a
good friend of mine gave my name and address to the Aryan Baby Drive
and immediately she sent us more than enough to help prepare for our
baby.... Today Valkyrie is 11 months old, and we still receive care
packages for her. I feel good knowing that the things she sent came
from good clean Aryan families.... I have sent all of my children's
clothing to the ABD when they outgrow them (I have to hug the
memories out of them first)."</TE>
<TE>   Almost enough to make you weep, isn't it? One can only imagine the
amount of love that could be sewn into clothing donated by white
supremacists.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site for the Baby Drive doesn't contain any explicitly
racist philosophy. But it does include a link to the Aryan Nations
site--and, of course, you can't call yourself "Aryan" anything
without telling the world what you really stand for.</TE>
<TE>   By e-mail I tried to reach the brains and heart of the Baby Drive
movement. I received an e-mail from someone who declined to be
interviewed but wrote, "I do not give you permission to print
anything about the ABD in any newspaper, not until I find out what
you intend to write, and please be exact."</TE>
<TE>   After replying that I couldn't agree to that, this second e-mail
arrived:</TE>
<TE>   "The Aryan Baby Drive Web site was created for the sole purpose of
enlightening the mass public to the unique, charitable project
undertaken. There are countless white families out there who could
use a helping hand, and that is what we are here for."</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to ask how Aryan clothing differs from non-Aryan. Even
more puzzling to me is how the Baby Drive people know for sure that
the clothing comes from committed white supremacists. What if some
minority group member with a twisted sense of humor sent some booties
or jammies? Would an alarm go off at Baby Drive headquarters?
Finally--and this is almost too chilling to contemplate--what would
happen if security were breached and an Aryan baby actually slipped
into clothing previously worn by a non-Aryan?</TE>
<TE>   The Baby Drive Web site has drawn the attention of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles--and not because it wants to donate.
The center included the site on its latest CD-ROM spotlighting "hate"
groups on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Cooper, the center's associate dean, concedes that the
site is at the more benign end of a spectrum that includes online
recruitment of suicide bombers, but that it was included on the 200
sites the center monitors to reflect the total context of the white
supremacist movement.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper says the Baby Drive site is a one-woman operation, but he
declined to identify her. When I ask how he knows her identity, he
says that part of the center's work is to monitor the whole range of
such movements around the world. The Wiesenthal Center is an
international Jewish human rights organization.</TE>
<TE>   The Baby Drive, Cooper says, "hearkens back to the Nazi ideology
of the 1930s. It's all a rip-off or an update of the Nazi mind-set
and policies where a woman was encouraged to have as many children as
possible for the state to preserve the Aryan race."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper isn't of a mind to see much heart-tugging about the Aryan
Baby Drive. "It's not a laughing matter," he says. "They're not a
mass movement, but there are thousands of people in the U.S. and
elsewhere who really do see life through that prism. Now they're
raising their children in a certain way, making sure they don't go to
certain kinds of movies and isolating themselves in the most diverse
ethnic pot [in Southern California], trying to keep themselves pure."</TE>
<TE>   And, at least with their babies, well-clothed.</TE>

<HD>Open House Offers Salute to Seabees</HD>
<DH>Military: Naval base festivities give a glimpse into 60
years of work by construction battalions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Seabee Days kicks off Saturday with a full dress military
parade, the procession will resonate with added purpose as Naval Base
Ventura County observes the 60th anniversary of combat construction
engineers.</LD>
<LD>   The annual open house offers throngs of visitors a
behind-the-scenes look at how the base operates. This year's lengthy
list of attractions includes tours aboard two Navy destroyers,
weapons exhibits, military displays, carnival rides, a motorcycle and
classic car show, athletic competitions and a concert by the rock
band Dishwalla at 2 p.m. Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But that's not all.</LD>
<TE>   "Seabee Days is a great opportunity for the community to come out
and see real-life examples of the types of construction the Seabees
do," said Capt. Jim Cowell, commander of the 31st Naval Construction
Regiment.</TE>
<TE>   Seabee units, which date back to March 1942, sprang from the
military's need for base construction and other support tasks in the
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Where did the moniker originate? Construction battalion was
shortened to CBs, then Seabees.</TE>
<TE>   The 1944 John Wayne movie "The Fighting Seabees" immortalized the
Navy group, whose logo sports a bee carrying a machine gun, a monkey
wrench and a hammer.</TE>
<TE>   Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme is home to four
construction battalions, each outfitted with more than 600 men and
women. Three of the battalions are currently in Port Hueneme, while
the 40th Naval Mobile Construction Battalion is now deployed in Guam.
More than 800 Seabees will take part in Saturday's parade, which
begins at 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Heightened security measures will be in place this year as a
result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said base spokeswoman Sarah
Burford. There will be random searches of vehicles entering the base.
Coolers, backpacks, skateboards, bicycles, glass containers and pets
will not be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors will have to register for the free ship tours at the
Seabee Days information booth, and those 16 and older must show a
photo ID. The number of tours--on the destroyers Stethem and
Decatur--will be limited this year and available only on first come,
first served basis. Ship tours will be given from noon to 5 p.m.
Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors can enter the base at the Patterson Road or Victoria
Avenue gates, which will open at 9 a.m. each day. Admission and
parking are free. Most events will be held from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Valley Breakup on Fall Ballot</HD>
<DH>Secession: Board of Supervisors makes it official after
deciding the wording about costs of a split to taxpayers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors took final action
Thursday to put San Fernando Valley cityhood on the Nov. 5 ballot,
after resolving a dispute over how voters will be informed about the
cost of secession.</LD>
<LD>   The board's unanimous vote to formally schedule the election
followed a so-called protest hearing that generated little protest.</LD>
<LD>   Just 8,809 of the city's 1.45 million voters filed written
protests to the secession election, and only 10 addressed the board.
Under state law, to stop the election, half of Los Angeles' voters
would have had to file protests.</LD>
<TE>   And although the board's role in setting the secession election
was largely routine, its drafting of the ballot measure language
proved crucial to both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents lobbied the supervisors to include in the
measure's wording the annual separation payments a Valley city would
have to make to L.A. Backers of Valley independence labeled that
effort an attempt to mislead and frighten voters. They said such
ballot language would falsely imply that secession would increase
costs to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors struck a compromise Thursday that seemed
acceptable to all. The ballot wording will contain a passage on the
separation payments, but will make it clear that they do not involve
new costs.</TE>
<TE>   The 20 years of payments would compensate L.A. for tax revenue
lost to Valley independence. They represent the amount of taxes paid
by Valley residents in excess of the value of city services the
region receives. They would be $127.1 million the first year and
decline by 5% annually.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure will describe the payments as "the difference
between the revenue collected in the San Fernando Valley area by the
city of Los Angeles in fiscal year 2000-2001 over and above the
amount expended by the city of Los Angeles in the Sam Fernando Valley
area ... "</TE>
<TE>   Secession campaign leader Richard Katz said he was pleased with
the final language, but would have to work hard to ensure that voters
understand it.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Katz said Thursday's action marked a "historic"
moment in the breakup campaign's six-year battle to get secession on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in the Valley are going to get to vote on
self-determination," Katz said. "It will change the way the city will
function forever for the better."</TE>
<TE>   For the Valley to become a separate city of 1.35 million people,
the ballot measure must win in the Valley as well as citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said he also was happy with the
wording of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "The [payment] figure had to be included," Middlebrook said. "It's
10% of the Valley city's budget, and it probably was subject to the
most debate of any issue debated."</TE>
<TE>   The board's decision also set the stage for an election for mayor
and 14 council seats in the proposed Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates can now circulate petitions to qualify for the ballot.
The paperwork deadline is Aug. 9. If secession loses, none of the
offices will be filled.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure will also give voters a chance to pick from
five names for a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Local Agency Formation Commission is scheduled to take
the last step in placing the Hollywood secession measure on the same
ballot. The panel is also expected to approve ballot language
portraying the Hollywood separation payments in terms similar to the
Valley measure.</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood city would have to pay Los Angeles $21.4 million the
first year, with the amount decreasing by 5% a year. A change in
state law gave LAFCO final authority over the Hollywood election.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Katz, a former assemblyman, faced City Council
President Alex Padilla in a debate Thursday about Valley cityhood
before the Southland Regional Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, a Valley native, made his case armed with economic
statistics. "If there was a poster child for not getting our fair
share, it's the northeast Valley," he said. But the councilman
painted secession as a financially and politically risky way to bring
change.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said secession is "about having a say in the future of our
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, a coalition of religious and civil rights groups
rallied in Studio City to announce its plans to fight secession,
saying a breakup would hurt the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition includes the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the Muslim
Public Affairs Council, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, and the
American Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition members said they feared a new Valley city would fail to
enact L.A. laws designed to protect the poor and elderly.</TE>

<HD>Simi Valley Council OKs Workers' Pact</HD>
<DH>Labor: The deal, subject to union members' ratification,
calls for a 4.9% pay and benefits hike over four years for 300
employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two months of tough negotiations, the Simi Valley City Council
on Wednesday OKd a new contract for about 300 union workers, agreeing
to give them a 4.9% raise in pay and benefits each year through 2006.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is subject to ratification by a majority of the union's
170 dues-paying members, said Zelma Baer, part of the negotiating
team for Service Employees International Union Local 988, which
covers police dispatchers, clerks, bus drivers, custodians, mechanics
and secretaries.</LD>
<LD>   Mail-in ballots will be sent out today, and Baer said she is
"optimistic and hopeful" the pact will be approved.</LD>
<TE>   The results are expected to be back by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been getting e-mails every 30 seconds, and the majority of
people are happy," said Baer, who works in the city's accounting
department. "They didn't want to strike."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many employees were so geared up for a possible walkout
that it may take time for them to get ready to give the contract
their approval, Edgar McLemore, president of the bargaining unit,
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We really did our job when we went out to get them motivated," he
said, adding that workers were ready to strike immediately if the
council had rejected the proposal. "Now we have to bring them back
down, and that's the process we're in."</TE>
<TE>   McLemore said he believes the agreement is a good one.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a lot of movement toward where we wanted to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 3% of the increase each year will go toward salaries, with
the remainder earmarked for benefits. Creation of a medical benefits
program for union retirees also is part of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The package, which totals 19.6% over four years, equates to about
$7.2 million in extra payroll costs, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the right thing to do by our employees, and I'm glad the
union [leaders] saw it that way, too," City Councilman Glen Becerra
said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that council members wanted to do whatever they could to
avoid a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it was very important to make a fair offer," he said.
"Very few people in this country right now are guaranteed a 20% raise
over four years."</TE>
<TE>   Increases to help employees cover the cost of rising insurance
premiums were a focus for the union throughout negotiations, which
began June 5.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the city's contribution toward a family's medical
insurance will rise from $310 a month to $960 a month in four years,
Baer said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the biggest jump we have ever made for general unit
employees in the history of the city," she said. "It will make a
considerable difference."</TE>
<TE>   In terms of salary, union officials say the average worker in the
bargaining unit makes $16 an hour. At the end of the contract, that
average wage will rise to $18 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The new contract would take effect Aug. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Laura Magelnicki said settling with the
union means that Simi Valley city leaders are finished--for a
while--with labor negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The police officers' union is in the second year of a four-year
contract, and city management employees, who are not represented by a
union, were given a 3.5% raise July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Next, city officials and union leaders will have to deal with a
classification and compensation study--due out in a few months--that
will compare in detail the wages and benefits of Simi Valley
municipal employees with those in other cities.</TE>

<LD>Roman Vargas' hands were cracked and peeling from working as a
dishwasher in a Koreatown restaurant. His bosses were often
physically and emotionally abusive, he says, and he was paid $250 a
week with no overtime or breaks.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas, who emigrated from Vera Cruz, Mexico, in 1999, knew
nothing about labor law, and like many other undocumented immigrants
working in Koreatown, was afraid of speaking up for his rights.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas said he had heard of an organization that helped immigrant
workers in Koreatown. But he wasn't sure that a group named Korean
Immigrant Workers Advocates would help a Mexican immigrant fight for
his rights.</LD>
<TE>   Vargas, 35, hesitantly walked into the agency's 8th Street office
one day. He was greeted by a Korean woman who spoke fluent Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   After KIWA helped him win two claims filed with the state
Department of Labor office against his former employer for about
$3,400, Vargas now works as a labor organizer for the group. He
informs Latino workers of their rights and helps them file their own
wage claims.</TE>
<TE>   "I want workers to know they have rights as immigrants," he said.</TE>
<TE>   KIWA, founded a month before the 1992 Los Angeles riots, is one of
several Los Angeles immigrant worker advocacy groups aimed at
navigating the bureaucratic world of labor laws for those such as
Vargas who are otherwise virtually voiceless.</TE>
<TE>   Two similar groups--the Pilipino Workers Center and the Thai
Community Development Center--were formed at KIWA's office and have
since moved on to neighborhoods where many Thai and Filipino
immigrants live. From the start, they used KIWA as their labor
organizing model.</TE>
<TE>   That agency's founders say they started it because of their belief
that immigrant Korean workers were being ignored in a neighborhood
where Korean merchants were being portrayed as a model minority
success story.</TE>
<TE>   "When KIWA started, the community didn't have a voice for these
poor working people," said Danny Park, one of the four founders.</TE>
<TE>   With just as many Latino immigrant workers in the neighborhood, it
also made sense to reach out to them, Parks added.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Latino workers in Koreatown know that KIWA is a
resource, mainly because six of the 11 staff members speak Spanish,
Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they see Latino faces here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming its staff attorney, 26-year-old Steve Arredondo
found that KIWA was the only advocacy group in the neighborhood
focused solely on workers' rights. "Growing up, I saw how immigrant
workers were treated," said Arredondo, whose father was a spray
painter from Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Arredondo sat with a worker speaking in
Spanish, preparing paperwork to file a wage claim against the owner
of the grocery store where the man worked.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the employees at KIWA and the other organizations, whose
work centers on immigration, labor, housing and consumer law, are not
lawyers. Nor have they formally studied law. But with help from legal
aid services and daily experience with workers' complaints, they say
they find themselves with enough legal knowledge to help provide
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times our clients don't understand their basic rights.
My staff is able to explain these processes to them in a way that's
simplified," said Chanchanit Martorell, executive director of the
Thai center. "Especially for the community we serve, who are the most
downtrodden and disenfranchised of society."</TE>
<TE>   The Pilipino Workers Center was formed in 1997 by a group of young
activists who believed the Filipino community lacked a voice for
immigrant workers. They say their main goal is to empower the
community by teaching workers how to have access to the law "so that
they're not always dependent on lawyers," said Executive Director
Aquilina Soriano.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano, 27, and four other PWC staff members--most in their early
20s--are finding themselves thrust into the legal world. "I've never
been to law school," Soriano said, but the paralegal work provided at
the center "comes from necessity."</TE>
<TE>   The Thai Community Development Center, which was instrumental in
freeing garment workers who authorities said were enslaved in an El
Monte sweatshop in 1995, has help from volunteers who practiced law
in Thailand and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Thai center's legal services were crucial to Tsonglim
Kamphiranon. Trafficked from Thailand, Kamphiranon worked for a
Woodland Hills family as a domestic for seven years. She was held
against her will in the home, working from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every
day, then working until midnight at a restaurant the family owned.</TE>
<TE>   With help from a friend, Kamphiranon escaped in 1999 and was taken
to the Thai center.</TE>
<TE>   The center helped Kamphiranon and another Thai worker prepare for
the federal trial against the employers--conducting mock court
hearings to show them where the judge sits, where the witness stand
is. The owner of the Woodland Hills home got eight years in prison
for involuntary servitude and harboring illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Now PWC is targeting the home health-care industry, which employs
many Filipino immigrants. Workers have complained that because they
are employed in home health care, they are prone to abuse--including
unsafe working conditions, sleep deprivation for live-in workers and
unfair wages.</TE>
<TE>   After recently filing claims against home health care facilities
with the state Labor Department, Soriano said it was hard to convince
the agency to accept the paperwork. "Because we knew the law, we had
to clarify," she said. The claims are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those served by the workers' groups have wound up working
as labor advocates themselves. Jung Hee Lee, 37, decided that she
could no longer endure working as a waitress in Koreatown when a
drunken customer burned her hand and her employer blamed her. She
also hurt her back while working, but her employer didn't have
workers' compensation insurance, she said. Her wage claims against
the restaurant have been pending with the state labor office for five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Today Lee is one of the loudest voices against firms like her
former employer. In August, KIWA launched a campaign against a noodle
restaurant in Koreatown, accusing it of not paying Latino workers
back wages and overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Her voice booming over a megaphone, Lee says she is using the
anger she felt toward her employer. After months of boycotting the
restaurant, KIWA won $40,000 in claims for two employees.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been telling workers to speak up and fight for their
rights," Lee said. "Korean culture is that whenever there is a
problem ... we keep quiet."</TE>

<LD>A Chevron gas station in Thousand Oaks and one in Oxnard were the
targets of armed robberies this week, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson Chevron in the 100 block of Thousand Oaks Boulevard East
was robbed about 10 p.m. Wednesday by a man who pulled up in a white
Honda Civic hatchback, got out and pointed a gun at a cashier,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A passenger did not get out of the car, authorities said. The pair
remained at-large Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   In an unrelated case, Anthony Robles Mosqueda, 31, was arrested
about 3 p.m. Wednesday on suspicion of holding up a Chevron station
in the 1900 block of North Rose Avenue in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Mosqueda, an Oxnard parolee, led officers on a short chase, during
which his Ford Escort struck another vehicle, authorities said. The
driver of that vehicle suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Mosqueda then tried to flee on foot. Officers

<HD>Winner's Margin Jolts Fellow Ultra Runners</HD>
<DH>Sports: Mother of three beats closest follower by five
hours. Running 'is my sanity,' she says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONE PINE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>On day three, Pam Reed went for a little jog.</LD>
<LD>   After running clear through one day and into the next, she
couldn't have been blamed if she had just cooled her heels on the day
after. She'd already become the first woman to win the Badwater
Ultramarathon, the 135-mile footrace across Death Valley. Her time of
27 hours, 56 minutes shattered a women's record seen as untouchable,
blowing away the rest of the 79-racer field, including all the men.
She finished nearly five hours ahead of the second-place finisher and
became one of only a few women to win a 100-mile-plus "ultra" event
outright.</LD>
<LD>   But after crashing hard Wednesday night at a motel on the
outskirts of this high desert town near the finish line, the
41-year-old Reed rose early Thursday--and went running.</LD>
<TE>   Said Reed with a shrug: "This is what I do."</TE>
<TE>   This was a particularly tough year for the Badwater, one of the
most grueling endurance events in the world. Temperatures were
considered average--reaching 123 degrees at one point. But a stiff
headwind quickly dehydrated and slowed the athletes. Several "name"
extreme-racers struggled early and dropped out. Nearly two dozen
racers found the dreaded "DNF" label next to their names on the
leader board: Did Not Finish.</TE>
<TE>   Into this morass of masochism and misery stepped the sprightly
Reed. A mother of three boys and stepmother of two more, she
electrified the nation's ultra-endurance competitors with her
performance in her first Badwater run. One aficionado called it
"stunning."</TE>
<TE>   Reed, director of the annual Tucson, Ariz., marathon, prevailed by
living up to another acronym of extreme racing: RFM, Relentless
Forward Motion.</TE>
<TE>   For most competitors this week, that was an unattainable goal.
Every other racer stopped along the side of the road for a catnap, a
massage, a quick meal. Reed never sat down. She stopped once, for
about 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a rock in my shoe," she said. "So I took the shoe off to
shake it out. It wasn't a rock."</TE>
<TE>   It was a bloated blood blister that covered her entire big toe on
her right foot. She popped it, drained it, put her shoe back on and
started anew.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't stop unless I have to throw up," she said. "And I never
did."</TE>
<TE>   The Badwater is considered a "run," but the truth is that most
athletes run only about a third of the race. The rest of the time,
they walk and lurch, fighting vomiting, diarrhea and delirium.</TE>
<TE>   Reed, who has finished 25 races of 100 miles or more, simply set
out for a jog Tuesday. She wound up running, albeit slowly at times,
for more than 100 miles, even as the temperature of the asphalt
neared an estimated 200 degrees. She ate once without losing
stride--half a peanut butter and honey sandwich. At 5 feet 3, she
weighed 104 pounds at the start and lost more than six pounds by the
end.</TE>
<TE>   Reed seemed genuinely unimpressed by her victory, genuinely
perplexed that she beat much of the field by more than 24 hours,
genuinely agog that some racers walked and ran for 2 1/2 days before
they finished Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   At the finish line, almost 9,000 feet up Mt. Whitney, the tallest
peak in the contiguous United States, many said it was as if Reed had
competed in a different event.</TE>
<TE>   "She did a running race," said Susy Bacal, Reed's best friend and
crew chief. "These [other] people are doing a sleep-deprivation
walk."</TE>
<TE>   Even her crew had failed to grasp the significance of the race.</TE>
<TE>   "We just gossiped and gabbed the whole time," Bacal said. "Now
that it's over, people keep asking me, 'What about her glycogen
levels? Did you check that? Did you ask her how her feet felt?' I
didn't. It never occurred to me."</TE>
<TE>   While there is still a statistical gap between the performance of
men and women in events that are based on strength and speed, women
are now some of the best endurance athletes in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Women typically have more fat reservoirs in their bodies. During a
quick run, athletes use carbohydrates as their source of energy. But
after many hours, the body begins using stored fat as a primary
energy source. Women are more efficient at metabolizing fat as fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Some women dominate extreme long-distance swimming events, for
instance. And, occasionally, a woman competes for a top spot on the
worldwide ultra circuit. Ann Trason, for example, considered the
greatest female ultra runner in the country, won the USA 24 Hour
Championship in Queens, N.Y., in 1989 when she ran 143 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is no central clearinghouse for results of ultra
events, after Trason's victory in Queens, Reed's win may be the
second outright victory by a woman in a "major" 100-mile-plus ultra
footrace, said Ryan Lammpa, a researcher with USA Track &amp; Field, the
sport's national governing body. Equally impressive is that Reed
broke the women's record--set two years ago by a Russian considered
among the best in the world--by nearly two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a stunning achievement," said Dan Brennan, the executive
director of the New Jersey-based American Ultrarunning Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the gender split seeps into these races.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday morning, the 17 women invited to the Badwater this year
were lumped into the 6 a.m. starting block, the first of three
staggered starting times. That was done, race organizers said,
largely because women typically run slower than men. The 6 a.m. block
was rounded out with 13 men, a few of whom grumbled about being stuck
in the "women's bracket."</TE>
<TE>   While an air of camaraderie and all-for-one prevails around the
Badwater, an undercurrent of machismo is not entirely concealed.</TE>
<TE>   "I always figured that if a woman won, we'd have to check her
chromosomes," said Ben Jones, a three-time Badwater competitor who
now serves as the race's unofficial "mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Even during the race, as Reed took an early lead, most athletes
assumed that she had underestimated the power of the heat and would
soon wilt.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way she can be running that fast," Lisa
Smith-Batchen, one of the top runners at the Badwater, said about
halfway through the race. "It can't last."</TE>
<TE>   But it did. Because of the staggered starting times, the long
distance and the lack of communication in the desert, no one was sure
Reed was going to win outright until she neared the end. Two men who
had been hot on her heels were driven to the sidelines by the heat.
At the finish line, she wept.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to cry," she said. "I'm no good at it."</TE>
<TE>   Running, Reed said, "is my sanity." Five weeks after delivering
her last child, stitches from a caesarian section still in her belly,
she finished another ultramarathon.</TE>
<TE>   Reed did not suggest that the Badwater was a cinch, not by a long
shot. The blisters on her feet were still swelling, so much so that
she jogged Thursday in thick socks and her husband's size-9 shoes.
She wears a women's 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hot and it was scary," she said. "I didn't know what was
going to happen to my body. I have no interest in killing myself."</TE>
<TE>   She will not be back at Badwater, she said. Reed ran, as she put
it, "the perfect race," and can't bear the thought of doing it again
without beating her time.</TE>
<TE>   So, after her morning jog Thursday, she decided to take in the
sights before heading back to Tucson. At the finish line, she chatted
with race organizers, as other athletes were still finishing, more
than a day after her triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Then she and Bacal set out for a long hike from the finish line
toward the peak of Mt. Whitney--walking, initially, in the wrong
direction until a friend caught them and steered them toward the
proper trailhead.</TE>
<TE>   A man heading toward a nearby campground shook his head as he
walked by.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like a woman," he said.</TE>

<LD>A federal judge in Louisiana ruled Thursday that the state illegally
used federal money to promote religion in its abstinence-only sex
education programs, a decision that could jeopardize President Bush's
ambitions for expanding the effort nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Thomas Porteous Jr. ordered the state to stop
giving money to individuals or organizations that "convey religious
messages or otherwise advance religion" with tax dollars. He said
there was ample evidence that many of the groups participating in the
Governor's Program on Abstinence were "furthering religious
objectives."</LD>
<LD>   Using government money to distribute Bibles, conduct prayer
rallies outside clinics that provide abortions and perform skits with
characters that preach Christianity violate the Constitution's
separation of church and state, he ruled.</LD>
<TE>   One group in its monthly report talked about using the Christmas
message of Mary as a prime example of the virtue of abstinence.</TE>
<TE>   "December was an excellent month for our program," the Rapides
Station Community Ministries said in a report quoted by the court.
"We were able to focus on the virgin birth and make it apparent that
God's desire (sic) sexual purity as a way of life."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Gov. Mike Foster expressed dismay over the decision and
said he would review the state's legal options.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad day when such a worthwhile program is attacked by the
very people who are supposed to protect the interests of the citizens
of Louisiana," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in May by the American Civil Liberties Union, was
the first legal challenge to abstinence-only programs created under
the 1996 welfare reform law. Bush has asked Congress to extend the
$50-million-a-year program and increase other federal abstinence
grants from $40 million this year to $73 million next year.</TE>
<TE>   Cities, states or organizations that receive the federal grants
must use the money to teach abstinence as the only reliable way to
prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Supporters say
abstinence education helps youngsters build character and develop the
skills to "say no to sex." Grant recipients may not discuss

<HD>For GOP, Events Add Up to Reversal of Fortune</HD>
<DH>Politics: Party, jittery over the stock market meltdown and
scandals, tries to counter its big-business image as it looks to fall
campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Republicans in Congress, increasingly jittery about the stock market
and the economy, are about to head home for their summer break to
confront a political landscape abruptly transformed--to their
distinct disadvantage.</LD>
<LD>   The Republicans are hopeful that Congress' virtually unanimous
passage Thursday of a major corporate reform bill will help control
damage caused by the ongoing spate of business scandals. But they are
scrambling to do even more to counter Democratic charges that the GOP
is too cozy with business and inept at handling the economy.</LD>
<LD>   To that end, they are touting pension-protection legislation that
the House passed months ago, considering additional tax relief for
beleaguered investors and agitating for changes in President Bush's
economic advisors.</LD>
<TE>   But mostly, they are just crossing their fingers and keeping their
televisions tuned to CNN's stock ticker rather than to C-SPAN.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's a nervousness; to deny that is to deny reality,'' said
Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.). ''But people are glad it's happening now
and hoping it doesn't sustain through the fall and that the market
will come back.''</TE>
<TE>   Like LaHood, many Republicans feel powerless to shape the broader
economic forces that could determine their political prospects.</TE>
<TE>   A looming fear is a potential October surprise: Voter reaction
when they receive financial reports from their 401(k)s and other
investments for the quarter that ends Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   LaHood said: ''When people open those 401(k) envelopes ... there
is going to be a lot of gasping and heart attacks.'' The extreme
volatility of the market, as amply demonstrated this week on Wall
Street, and the uncertainty about the economy make for a risky
political environment for the party in power.</TE>
<TE>   ''The people of this country are off balance, they are angry, they
are scared,'' said Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.). ''That is a very
combustible mixture, especially for an election.''</TE>
<TE>   It's a striking shift in the political winds from just a few weeks
ago, when Republicans seemed to be sitting pretty. Bush's approval
ratings remained sky high and the congressional agenda was dominated
by the issues that polls show voters think Republicans handle best:
security at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans appeared on course to avoid the losses that the
president's party usually suffer in mid-term elections. GOP leaders
were confident they would hold--and perhaps slightly expand--their
slim House majority. The party's focus was on overcoming the one-seat
Democratic margin in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   GOP Is Worried</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed during the last month, sparking Republican
worries about their vulnerabilities in the November election.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's job approval ratings have begun to slip--down to 67% in a
recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, the lowest since the Sept. 11
attacks. New polls, including one by GOP pollster Bill McInturff,
report that a majority of people think the country is on the ''wrong
track'' rather than moving in the ''right direction.'' And the
congressional agenda has shifted to concerns about corporate
corruption--highlighting populist issues that play to Democrats'
political strengths.</TE>
<TE>   ''The public is currently more receptive to our message than they
were six months ago,'' said Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff to House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) called a news conference
Wednesday to accuse Democrats of deliberately trying to undermine
confidence in the financial markets and the economy to bolster their
electoral prospects. Democratic leaders ''are practicing the politics
of economic destruction,'' DeLay said.</TE>
<TE>   DeLay and other GOP leaders insist that voter concerns about
corporate corruption and the economy have not undercut GOP
candidates. ''All our incumbents remain in strong positions,'' said
Carl Forti, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee. ''Voters are not assigning blame to their representatives
at this point.''</TE>
<TE>   But to keep it that way, many Republicans want a more aggressive
response on corporate reform issues--by their party and by Bush--to
defend against an expected Democratic onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   ''We need to do something to get confidence back in the stock
market,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.). ''We see this as a problem that needs positive
congressional action.''</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are citing the volatile markets in a renewed push for
economic measures already on the table--such as Bush's request for
more trade-negotiating power. And they are stepping up pressure on
the Democrat-controlled Senate to act on legislation passed by the
House in April to provide new protections for participants in 401(k)
retirement plans. Senate Democrats plan action in September on a
measure that goes even further than the House bill.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have been slow to resort to their traditional salve
for an ailing economy: tax cuts. That's because growing federal
budget deficits have made Democrats--and even some Republicans--wary
of draining revenue. A few GOP lawmakers would like to see action on
capital gains tax cuts, but party leaders are wary of proposing
measures that Democrats would surely attack as a sop to the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Plan for Tax Breaks</TE>
<TE>   Instead, House GOP leaders may introduce measures that would
provide tax breaks or other relief to investors who have suffered
losses because of corporate fraud or the swooning stock market.
Another measure being considered would give retirees more flexibility
in deciding when they can make withdrawals from their 401(k)
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   House GOP leaders have been circulating memos with encouraging
poll numbers and advice on how to handle the corporate fraud issue.</TE>
<TE>   They are urging lawmakers to use the summer recess to tout the
strengths of the economy, in keeping with Bush's message that its
fundamentals are sound.</TE>
<TE>   ''The good news is being overwhelmed by the stock market's bad
news,'' Rep. J. C. Watts Jr. (R-Okla.) said in a memo to House
Republicans. ''Each of us has an opportunity and a responsibility to
help get the positive message out.''</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans believe, however, that Bush is in the best
position to manage the public's expectations and perceptions of the
economy--and that he still has work to do on that front.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is running for an open Senate
seat, said Bush needed to do a better job of explaining his economic
game plan.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said the upcoming bill-signing ceremony for the corporate
reform bill is an opportunity for Bush to explain: ''We get it; we're
going to stay on top of the problem.''</TE>
<TE>   Other Republicans lay part of the blame on Bush's economic
advisors, none of whom has assumed a commanding role in articulating
the administration's policies. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has
come under fire recently for traveling abroad while the stock market
has been reeling.</TE>
<TE>   ''What the market needs is someone who can paint a picture of a
better future ahead,'' said Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.). Referring to a
much-publicized trip O'Neill took with the lead singer for the rock
group U2, Foley added: ''Being in Africa with Bono is not what we
need.''</TE>

<HD>Senators Press Ashcroft to Justify Tactics in Terror War</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: 'The entire United States of America is a target,'
the attorney general tells committee, defending White House's
wide-ranging measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft came under fire Thursday for his handling of
the war on terrorism, as congressional critics charged that the Bush
administration has gone too far in detaining immigrants, operating in
secret and asking citizens to spy on their neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   But Ashcroft defended the administration's wide-ranging law
enforcement tactics and refused to ramp down anti-terrorist rhetoric
that even some in the White House believe has become too shrill at
times.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the entire United States of America is a target for
terrorist activities," Ashcroft told members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee when asked about recent reports of terrorist "sleeper
cells" operating in the Seattle area and other parts of the
Northwest.</LD>
<TE>   He said the threat of terrorists lurking within the United States
"should be taken seriously" across the entire country, adding: "I
would exempt no city." The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, Ashcroft said, revealed a "presence"
of terrorist supporters in San Diego, Phoenix, Oklahoma City,
Minneapolis and other cities that "might not appear [obvious] to
those of us who would say, 'Now, where would you find a terrorist?' "</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, a former senator, has faced stepped-up criticism in
recent weeks for allegedly using the war on terrorism as his own
political bully pulpit, and Senate Democrats at Thursday's
hearing--joined by a few Republicans--sought to hold him accountable
for the administration's missteps.</TE>
<TE>   Sparking the most controversy was an element of President Bush's
homeland security plan that would create a network of millions of
American workers to report "suspicious and potentially
terrorist-related activity."</TE>
<TE>   The program aims to enlist truck drivers and other workers whose
jobs, the administration says, put them in a "unique position" to see
suspicious activity.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is scheduled to begin its Terrorism
Information and Prevention System, or Operation TIPS, in the fall,
but the program has generated criticism from civil libertarians and
other groups, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) proposed
a measure last week that would ban its operation.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, said the program risks infringing on the privacy rights of
all Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "We can be vigilant, but we don't want to be vigilantes," Leahy
told Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy asked what the FBI would do, for instance, if a telephone
repairman entered someone's home and spotted a photo of the World
Trade Center, a book on Islamic terrorism or something else he
considered suspicious. "If they call that in," Leahy said, "what
happens?"</TE>
<TE>   "Telephone repairmen have the opportunity, just like you have an
opportunity, to call the FBI at any time," Ashcroft answered. "Any
citizen has the opportunity to call the FBI."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, seeking to ease concerns among committee members, said
he has received assurances from the administration that the tips
generated by the program will be referred to appropriate law
enforcement agencies but will not be stored in any database.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the
committee, said he found that position "reassuring to me.... We don't
want to see a 1984 Orwellian type situation here where neighbors are
reporting on neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that what this involves is legitimate
reporting of real concerns that might involve some terrorist
activity."</TE>
<TE>   Senators also were concerned that the administration has refused
to publicly spell out the standards it is using to detain immigrants
or others with suspected terrorist ties, even if they are U.S.
citizens--as in the case of accused "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a standard," said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.).
"It's just not enough to say there is discretion, unfettered
discretion, in the office of the attorney general."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department "'goes awry" when it keeps such matters
secret, said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   Whether the issue is creating military tribunals or locking
"'enemy combatants" up in Cuba, "there are no guidelines, absolutely
none. And everyone scratches their head and says, 'How far are they
going to go?' " Schumer said.</TE>
<TE>   Generating still more controversy at the hearing was a Justice
Department decision last fall not to allow the FBI to run its
database on gun purchase requests against a list of terrorism
suspects to determine whether any of them had tried to buy firearms.</TE>
<TE>   A report earlier this week by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, disclosed that a legal opinion last
fall within Justice concluded that such a search was allowed. The
opinion appeared to contradict Ashcroft's repeated assertions that
the Justice Department believed such a search would have violated
federal gun laws by using gun records for investigative purposes
rather than general auditing.</TE>
<TE>   Several senators suggested that Ashcroft, a staunch supporter of
the 2nd Amendment who opposes the retention of federal gun purchase
records for more than 24 hours, was letting his views on firearms get
in the way of common-sense tactics against terrorists. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) became irate in questioning Ashcroft about the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of the legal opinion written by your own staff, I simply
can't understand why the department decided to reject the FBI's
request to investigate the gun purchases by suspected Sept. 11
terrorists," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft stood his ground. He said the Justice Department
opinion was "consistent with my testimony" concerning the issue in
December, adding that "the only recognized use now of approved
purchase records is limited to an auditing function."</TE>

<HD>Bankruptcy Bill Clears Impasse Over Abortion</HD>
<DH>Congress: House-Senate negotiators finally reach pact after
clinic protest issue is resolved. It is seen as a victory for credit
card companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Ending a yearlong legislative logjam, key House and Senate
negotiators reached agreement on a bill Thursday night that would
make it harder for people to unload debts by filing for bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The breakthrough came as House and Senate negotiators resolved a
stubborn impasse over a Democratic-backed provision to prevent
abortion-clinic protesters from evading criminal fines by filing for
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a victory for women," said Sen. Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.), leading proponent of the abortion-related provision. "The
agreement we reached today ensures those who use violence to close
clinics can't use bankruptcy as a shield."</LD>
<TE>   The compromise is also a victory for credit card companies, who
since the mid-1990s have lobbied hard for a bill to help stem
millions of dollars of losses the industry sustains every year from
bankrupt customers.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the bill, which was agreed upon months ago but stalled
by the abortion dispute, would force more people to file under
Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. That requires debtors to work out
repayment plans for at least part of their debts. Credit card
companies and other financial institutions have been arguing that the
current law allows too many people to file for bankruptcy under
Chapter 7, which wipes out debts entirely. To crack down on that, the
bill would establish a "means test" to determine who qualifies for a
Chapter 7 filing.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates fought against the measure, calling it a gift
to big donors. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, since
1990 the financial services industry has contributed about $27
million to the campaigns of members of Congress in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents argue that the bill would do little to stem the
proliferation of credit cards, which they say entice some consumers
to assume more debt than they should. The foes also say the bill
would hurt economically struggling families by making it harder to
get legitimate relief from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "This so-called bankruptcy reform is terrible for consumers and
working families trying to rebuild their lives, especially in these
bad economic times," said Allison Dobson, spokeswoman for Sen. Paul
Wellstone (D-Minn.).</TE>
<TE>   But barring last-minute glitches, the bill is expected to be
approved by the House today and the Senate next week. President Bush
has indicated he will sign it.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement on the bankruptcy measure came on the same day as
congressional enactment of corporate reform legislation sparked by
recent business scandals. The actions are part of a cascade of
legislative activity as Congress prepares for its summer recess and
this fall's midterm campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Along with House and Senate passage Thursday of the corporate
reform legislation, both chambers were expected to pass legislation
to create a new homeland security department within the next week.
Negotiations over trade legislation quickened, and a long-stalled
bill to finance anti-terrorism initiatives finally cleared Congress
earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Passage of the bankruptcy bill will mark the culmination of a
legislative journey that has taken unusual twists and turns, even by
the standards of Capital Hill's often-convoluted process.</TE>
<TE>   "We have worked hard for a year to make this a better and more
balanced bill, and we have succeeded," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate have voted on similar bills many times since
the late 1990s. A similar measure cleared both chambers in 2000 but
was vetoed by President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was spurred by a surge in personal bankruptcy
filings over the last decade. According to the American Financial
Services Assn., a record 1.43 million bankruptcies were filed in
2001--up 14% over 2000. In 1985, the filings totaled only 298,000.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attribute the increase in part to the proliferation of
credit cards and a reduction in the social stigma attached to
bankruptcy. But the bill's proponents say another factor is growing
abuse of the bankruptcy code by people who have the means to make
partial repayment.</TE>
<TE>   To crack down on that, the compromise bill would require any
debtor who has enough resources to pay 25% of his or debt over five
years--or who earns the median income for his or her state--to try to
repay at least some of the debt.</TE>
<TE>   Although the abortion dispute was the last issue to be settled,
another hurdle was surmounted earlier this year after the financial
collapse late last year of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   That corporate controversy spotlighted a controversial loophole in
current law that allows bankruptcy filers in several
states--including Texas, where Enron is based--to keep expensive
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators on the bankruptcy bill in April agreed to a compromise
that would limit this so-called homestead exemption for felons and
others convicted of financial misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   The abortion dispute stemmed from a Schumer amendment to the
Senate bill--not included in the House version--aimed at preventing
abortion opponents from declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying fines
imposed as a result of violent protests at abortion clinics. That
tactic has been used by some abortion protesters in recent years,
including Randall Terry of Operation Rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting the Schumer amendment was Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.),
who opposed the idea of singling out abortion protesters for special
stipulations.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise uses more general terms, barring the use of
bankruptcy to avoid fines incurred for blocking access to any lawful
facility or activity.</TE>
<TE>   Hyde was not available to comment on the agreement.</TE>

<HD>Curb Malpractice Suits to Fix 'Badly Broken' System, Bush
Says</HD>
<DH>Health: Savings--tens of billions, he says--could be spread
around other areas. Skeptics doubt the math.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HIGH POINT, N.C.</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Thursday that stringent new limits on medical
malpractice lawsuits would yield tens of billions of dollars in
savings that could lower insurance premiums across the board, help
senior citizens buy prescription drugs and extend health coverage to
millions of uninsured Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Calling on Congress to enact limits already in place in
California, Bush cited a "badly broken malpractice system" as a major
reason for increasing health-care costs.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a national problem that requires a national solution," Bush
said here.</LD>
<TE>   But consumer activist groups, trial lawyers and their Democratic
allies in Congress took strong exception to Bush's claims, with some
accusing him of stressing the malpractice litigation issue as a ploy
to divert attention from his lack of success in producing more
far-reaching health-care reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are injured ought to be able to take their case to
court--no question about it," Bush said in a speech at High Point
University to 1,700 doctors, nurses and other health-care workers and
administrators. "But we've got to understand that frivolous lawsuits
clog our courts and deny people with legitimate claims."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said California's "reasonable" malpractice limits have kept
costs relatively low and have led to more affordable, more available
and safer care for the state's residents--a claim some analysts
disputed.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said it would be difficult to calculate the
health-care savings attributable to California's damage caps and then
to extrapolate from them nationally. Each state has a different set
of laws, and no one can say with authority how lawsuits would have
been resolved if the limits were not in place.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly wouldn't venture a dollar amount, let alone a
projection nationally, as to what it would save," Stanford University
law professor Robert Rabin said. "Those savings obviously come at a
cost in terms of cases that are brought, some of which would be
legitimate claims for negligence on the part of doctors."</TE>
<TE>   According to data for 2000 from the National Assn. of Insurance
Commissioners, insurers spent a smaller percentage of premiums
collected--45.8%--in California to pay claims against medical
providers than the national average of 80.9%.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that jury awards and therefore settlements in
California are less than they would have been under the old
common-law rules on damages because of the restrictions," UC Berkeley
law professor Stephen Sugarman said.</TE>
<TE>   To buttress Bush's message, Senate Republicans had planned
Thursday to introduce an amendment limiting medical malpractice
lawsuits. But Democratic leaders hoped to manage the floor schedule
in such a way as to block the amendment or at least to delay a vote
on the measure.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Bush displayed unusual gusto as he denounced trial
lawyers, blaming them for "junk lawsuits" that he said have forced up
costs and driven doctors out of the profession.</TE>
<TE>   The president's assertions brought a swift response from
Democrats, led by Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), who made his fortune in
North Carolina as a personal injury attorney. His cases included some
high-profile medical malpractice lawsuits, one of which was cited by
a Department of Health and Human Services study on malpractice
litigation released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with reporters, Edwards--a possible opponent
for Bush in 2004--said the president's speech "makes no sense to me
at all," stating that malpractice litigation accounts for
"significantly less than 1%" of overall health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, Edwards said, the projected savings that Bush claimed
will not materialize.</TE>
<TE>   He said the president's advocacy of malpractice reform "fits a
pattern with an administration when it comes to the interests of
regular people competing with the interests of big corporations,
insurance companies, HMOs and energy companies."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, soaring malpractice insurance premiums have
prompted physicians and other health-care providers in many parts of
the country to drastically reduce their practices or to discontinue
them altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Thus Bush endorsed legislation proposed by Rep. James C. Greenwood
(R-Pa.) to limit the number of years that a plaintiff has to file a
lawsuit; allocate damages in proportion to a party's degree of
culpability; impose a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages; and limit
punitive damages to $250,000 or twice the amount of economic damages,
whichever is greater.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also endorsed principles that included provisions to allow
medical providers to pay judgments in installments rather than in
lump sums, and to require that juries be informed if a plaintiff has
other potential sources of reimbursement for an injury. The president
said he favors unlimited compensation for economic damages, such as
lost wages.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also demanded legal protections for "patient safety and
quality improvement" programs designed to encourage physicians and
other providers to share information about problems, errors and
"near-misses" as a way to prevent future errors.</TE>
<TE>   These "good faith" efforts now are ineffective because of the
widespread fear among doctors that such discussions can become the
basis of lawsuits, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The HHS report released Wednesday said that malpractice insurance
premiums are more than three times lower in states that impose caps
on noneconomic damages, such as California and Florida, than in
states that do not. Noneconomic damages include such intangible items
as "pain and suffering" and "loss of companionship."</TE>
<TE>   If applied nationally, such limits could save $60 billion to $110
billion a year; that money could be used for prescription drug
coverage, for bolstering Medicare and Medicaid and for providing
health insurance to more than 2 million uninsured Americans, the HHS
study stated.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats and consumer groups questioned Bush's claim that such
huge savings could accrue from cracking down on malpractice suits.
According to a study by the Consumer Federation of America, medical
malpractice premiums represent only 0.55% of total health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely bogus," said Joanne Doroshow, executive director
of the Center for Justice and Democracy, a national consumer group
based in New York. "This is a very cruel and misdirected proposal
that will only make rich insurance companies richer than they already
are."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said in his remarks that malpractice reform can save the
federal government $25 billion in spending for programs such as
Medicare and Medicaid, and programs for veterans and soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Some health-care activists criticized Bush for focusing on an
emerging problem that nevertheless is dwarfed by such needs as
prescription drug coverage for senior citizens or insurance for the
more than 40 million Americans who have no coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is trying to divert attention because he has
produced virtually nothing on health care," said Ron Pollack, head of
Families USA, which advocates universal coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "He's diverting attention to a low-priority matter, and it's a
reflection of his failure to get anything done of significance in the
health-care arena," Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Altman--head of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit
health-care policy center based in Menlo Park, Calif.--said he was
not surprised by Bush's focus on medical malpractice reform.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always useful for elected officials to show that they
care--whether or not they get anything done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From High Point, Bush drove to nearby Greensboro to speak at a
$750,000 fund-raiser for the National Republican Senatorial Committee
and Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who challenged him for the 2000 GOP
presidential nomination and now is a candidate for a Senate seat from
North Carolina.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Expand Cuba Jail for More Terrorist Suspects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With captures of terrorist suspects expected to keep mounting, the
U.S. military is planning to build more cells at its high-security
prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, defense officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The permanent jail at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, the main
military facility for holding and interrogating suspects, is nearly
full, with 564 suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners from the
campaign in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon has accepted bids and expects to award a contract
within days for construction of 200 more units at the 600-cell
facility, known as Camp Delta, the officials said Thursday on
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The military also has about 80 detainees at a base in Bagram,
Afghanistan, some of whom it would like to transfer to Cuba. An
unknown number of others are held by U.S. forces in undisclosed
locations, and still undisclosed others are under the control of the
CIA and foreign governments, defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cuba facility--as well as the administration's holding of
prisoners without charges or access to lawyers--has drawn criticism
from human rights and civil rights groups. The government declines to
categorize those being held as prisoners of war with attending
rights, saying they're not legitimate combatants as defined under
international treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Though most gains recently announced by U.S.-led forces in
Afghanistan have been in uncovering weapons rather than people,
officials expect to keep rooting out Taliban and Al Qaeda in the
9-month-old campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of those still in pockets of resistance in Afghanistan
and neighboring Pakistan range from hundreds to thousands, Brig. Gen.
John W. Rosa Jr. said at a Pentagon news conference Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, lately it's been a lot of small pockets of them," said
Defense Department spokeswoman Victoria Clarke.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Clarke said, "they exist, and we're going to continue
to go after them."</TE>
<TE>   Though the new construction at Camp Delta would mean space for
more than 800 people, officials previously have said they may expand
the prison to eventually hold 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   But there also was some hope the United States might not have to
take long-term responsibility for large numbers of prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have said some might be sent home for prosecution by
their own governments, others put before new U.S. military tribunals
and some held indefinitely.</TE>

<HD>Stabilize Afghanistan Before Attacking Iraq, Gore Advises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Al Gore told young Democrats Thursday that he supports the overthrow
of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein but questioned whether the invasion of
Iraq is a good idea while the future stability of Afghanistan remains
in question.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the principle of 'first things first' does apply and has
to be followed if we are to have any chance of success," the former
vice president said in a visit to Capitol Hill he described as his
first since leaving office.</LD>
<LD>   Gore, the 2000 Democratic nominee for president, made the comments
to a group called 21st Century Democrats at the Dirksen building near
the Capitol, where many senators have their offices.</LD>
<TE>   In a low-key discussion with more than 500 young Democrats who
packed into the conference room, Gore mixed in some jokes during his
criticism of the Bush administration's economic plans and foreign
policy.</TE>
<TE>   He criticized the president for frequently threatening to topple
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly question why we would be publicly blustering and
announcing an invasion a year or two years in advance," Gore said,
noting that some officials had leaked battle strategy documents.</TE>
<TE>   "What was that all about?" Gore said to laughter.</TE>
<TE>   He praised President Bush's response to the Sept. 11 attacks but
said the administration has made mistakes recently in Afghanistan,
notably in not allowing a sufficient number of international
peacekeepers to prevent the country from drifting back toward the
control of warlords.</TE>
<TE>   Gore also said:</TE>
<TE>   * People should compare the current economic problems with
conditions under President Clinton, adding: "We had the strongest
economy in history."</TE>
<TE>   * Deficits are the result of the Bush administration's economic
policy and tax cuts, not Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   * Questionable practices in corporate accounting can be compared
with current practices in federal government accounting.</TE>
<TE>   * He will make a decision by year's end whether to run for
president in 2004.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Panel to Probe Spy Agency Failures</HD>
<DH>Congress: Huge intelligence spending bill includes
independent probe of Sept. 11-related actions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House voted Thursday to create an independent commission to
examine intelligence failures surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks, a
move adamantly opposed by the White House and Republican leaders in
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The plan was passed as an amendment to an intelligence spending
bill that calls for an enormous increase in funding for the nation's
spy agencies, including the CIA and National Security Agency.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal for the commission, which appears to face an uphill
path in the Senate, is more limited in scope than Democrats had
sought. It does not, for example, allow for an investigation of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service or other non-intelligence
agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, passage was a surprise success for Democrats in the
GOP-controlled House and puts new pressure on President Bush to
rethink his opposition to an independent review.</TE>
<TE>   "He could and should do this when 3,000 people are killed in our
homeland," said Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.), sponsor of the provision
calling for the creation of an independent commission.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would expand intelligence spending by about 25%,
according to a senior House Democratic aide. Precise budget figures
for the nation's 13 intelligence agencies are classified, but are
believed to total from $30 billion to $35 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the ranking Democrat on the
House Intelligence Committee, said the boost in funding amounts to
the largest annual percentage increase in two decades. And Rep.
Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.) called it "the most significant investment"
in the intelligence community in years.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called intelligence authorization bill, a broad spending
plan for the coming fiscal year, was passed on a voice vote, meaning
there was no roll call.</TE>
<TE>   But while Congress is clearly in the mood to lavish money on the
intelligence community, Thursday's vote on Roemer's amendment exposed
deep divisions over how much additional scrutiny the nation's spy
agencies should face.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment passed 219 to 188, with 193 Democrats and 25
Republicans voting in favor of creating a National Commission on
Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment was opposed by Goss and other Republicans, who
argued that a separate inquiry is unnecessary when the House and
Senate intelligence committees are already working on such a probe,
expected to last into next year.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also has resisted the idea, saying the burden of
complying with another inquiry could distract intelligence officials
already working overtime to track down Al Qaeda operatives around the
globe and detect new terrorist plots.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Vice President Dick Cheney sought an informal
deal with congressional leaders, promising full administration
cooperation with an inquiry but asking leaders to confine the inquiry
to the congressional committees.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of an independent investigation say that few events
in the nation's history warrant more careful examination than the
Sept. 11 attacks and that the matter deserves to be probed by a panel
removed from the partisan politics of Capitol Hill and artificial
congressional deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers leading the Capitol Hill inquiry of Sept. 11, for
example, are scheduled to finish their terms on the intelligence
committees at the end of this year, putting pressure on the joint
inquiry to complete its work quickly.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans were able to whittle away at the scope of the
independent commission by raising procedural objections. Roemer was
forced, for instance, to abandon provisions calling for the
commission to examine the INS, the Customs Service and other
government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Prospects for an independent commission remain uncertain in the
Senate. Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.)
have introduced a bill calling for a blue-ribbon panel to probe
several government agencies in connection with Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Lieberman said the senator viewed Thursday's
vote in the House as an encouraging sign. "It's much more narrow than
the senator has introduced and proposed," she said. "But it gives the
bill a lot of momentum."</TE>
<TE>   But the legislation faces Republican opposition and lukewarm
support from some Democrats. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said
the Lieberman-McCain bill does not appear to have the 60 votes needed
to overcome a filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   The more narrowly focused commission approved by the House would
attract even less support in the Senate, the aide said, because "it's
a review of what the intelligence committee is already reviewing."</TE>
<TE>   Roemer, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, disputed
that, saying the independent commission could build on the work of
congressional investigators and could tap outsiders with different
areas of expertise.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is expected to take up its version of the intelligence
authorization bill next week. Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of
the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he knew of no plans in the
Senate for an amendment calling for an independent commission.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The city of Denver's cable channel unveiled a new program featuring
the mug shots of men convicted of soliciting prostitutes.</LD>
<LD>   "Johns-TV," part of a crackdown on prostitution, debuted with 11
men.</LD>
<LD>   "If you choose to risk catching a sexually transmitted disease,
you now also choose to take the risk of having your picture appear on
TV for the whole world to see," said Denver Mayor Wellington Webb.</LD>
<TE>   Denver instituted the program to curb prostitution, primarily
along Colfax Avenue, a main east-west thoroughfare that winds through
downtown and into residential neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Increased police patrols and sting operations failed to put a dent
in the trade, according to the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The mug shots are also posted on the city's Web site, complete
with a search function to locate people by name.</TE>
<TE>   The cable program and Web site will be updated monthly.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Massachusetts lawmakers voted Thursday to override acting Gov. Jane
Swift's veto and enact one of the biggest tax increases in state
history, a package totaling $1.1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The Democrat-controlled Senate voted 28 to 9, largely along party
lines. The House, which also is controlled by Democrats, overrode the
Republican governor's veto Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The slumping economy caused a downturn in tax revenue and
lawmakers decided to raise taxes to avoid deep cuts to services such
as schools, housing and health care. Opponents said the taxes will
stifle business.</LD>

<HD>Senate OKs $9-Billion Shift of Medicaid to States</HD>
<DH>Health care: Governors praise the effort to shore up
services that have been hurt by budget woes. The House has not passed
a similar plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate passed a measure Thursday that would send $9 billion in
Medicaid help to states struggling to care for the poor amid
shrinking budgets.</LD>
<LD>   Governors, who had pressed for the proposal, praised the 75-24
vote.</LD>
<LD>   "Many states continue to face budget shortfalls and face the
prospect of instituting significant cuts in health care and social
services to curb expenditures," said Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton, as
chairman of the National Governors Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The measure "is an important first step in helping states maintain
service levels during the continuing fiscal crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, the association's vice chairman, said
the Senate action "ensures that many low-income families will be
protected from drastic cuts."</TE>
<TE>   The measure would give states $6 billion in additional federal
matching funds and $3 billion in grants to help them pay for child
care and other social service programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Medicaid provision is attached to an overall bill to ease
access to generic drugs. Lawmakers continued to work Thursday on a
compromise Medicare drug benefit proposal that they would also like
to add to the generic drug bill.</TE>
<TE>   The House has not passed a similar plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Medicaid measure brought cooperation among Senate Republicans
and Democrats, getting far more than the 60 votes needed for passage.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a bailout," said Sen. John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV
(D-W.Va.), a sponsor of the plan. "I would say it's very important
for the states to be healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Medicaid was created to provide health care to people on welfare
and is financed by a combination of federal and state money. On
average, Washington pays 57%.</TE>
<TE>   But with health-care spending increasing and the troubled economy
forcing tight budgets, states have been sounding the alarm about
Medicaid, one of the fastest-growing portions of state budgets.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 states suffered budget shortfalls of $40 billion to
$50 billion in the last fiscal year. Medicaid spending increased 13%
and now constitutes 20% of state budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents had argued that the plan amounts to a giveback for
states.</TE>
<TE>   "We're broke and we don't act like it," said Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas). "A year ago we had a surplus. Today we have a $165-billion
deficit, and we're still spending like drunken sailors."</TE>

<HD>Rescuers Drilling Toward 9 Trapped Pa. Coal Miners</HD>
<DH>Accident: The men are 300 feet below ground, with water
pouring into their tiny air pocket.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB and STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SOMERSET, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Faint as whispers, tapping noises from deep underground signaled hope
to rescuers who spent Thursday tunneling 300 feet down toward a mine
shaft where nine Pennsylvania miners were trapped in a cramped
chamber flooding with cold groundwater.</LD>
<LD>   At nightfall, a giant truck-mounted mechanical drill rushed in
from West Virginia began boring a 2 1/2-foot-wide opening deep into
the dense earth. Digging the underground pathway was expected to take
up to 18 hours before it could reach the subterranean air pocket
where the miners were caught after they accidentally breached the
wall of an abandoned mine Wednesday night, triggering a collapse of
dirt and water.</LD>
<LD>   The ear-splitting drone of drills and hiss of air compressors rose
so loudly over the hilly western Pennsylvania countryside that crews
had to use delicate seismic monitors to listen for the weakening
metallic sounds from below.</LD>
<TE>   Last heard late Thursday morning, the tapping from the lower
depths of the Quecreek mine remained firm evidence of life to the
weary rescuers and families who kept vigil in a nearby fire hall.
They prayed that the machines could save their men.</TE>
<TE>   "We still believe there are miners alive," said David Hess,
Pennsylvania's secretary of environmental protection. "This is a very
tricky and dangerous situation, and I don't want to raise
expectations."</TE>
<TE>   State and mining company officials said the miners were likely
hemmed in inside a narrow 3-foot-high vault beneath the earth, an air
pocket prone to groundwater pouring in from the open wall of the
adjacent mine. Officials said that nearly 50 million gallons of
water, as cold as 55 degrees and likely contaminated, lay behind the
breached mine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very large body of water and it's coming in at a very high
rate," said Joseph Sbaffoni of Pennsylvania's Bureau of Deep Mine
Safety.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue crews manned smaller mechanical drills all day Thursday,
punching holes deep into the ground and then operating air
compressors to force the flooding water up to the surface at a rate
of 15,000 gallons a minute.</TE>
<TE>   But Hess worried openly that the rescue shaft--which had
penetrated only 45 feet down by 9 p.m.--might pierce the air pockets
created by the compressors and flood the chamber where the miners
were trapped. "This is a very delicate operation," Hess cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   For the relatives and friends of the trapped men, it was hope
enough. Long past dusk, they headed for the drilling site on a farm
100 yards off the main highway. There, they prayed and talked
quietly, their faces lighted by the glare of portable spotlights that
cut through the night mist.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like this hits so hard in a mining town where people
know each other and care about each other," said Marlene Seese, whose
father worked a lifetime in the mines and whose grandfather died of a
mining injury.</TE>
<TE>   The impulse to band together is now well-practiced in Somerset
County, a farming community 55 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. On
Sept. 11, residents were jolted by the crash of United Airlines
Flight 93, which plunged into a field in nearby Shanksville. Since
then, Somerset County residents have turned the site into their
patriotic memorial to passengers who they believe became heroic
martyrs fighting Al Qaeda hijackers for control of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   But on Thursday, the fate of the nine miners obscured even the
memory of the hijacking tragedy. Before nightfall, the town's two
McDonald's restaurants altered their outside marquees to read: "Pray
for the rescue of the miners."</TE>
<TE>   Touring the rescue site, Pennsylvania Gov. Mark Schweiker urged
sweat-streaked crews to "stay with it. [The families] are counting on
you."</TE>
<TE>   Schweiker said he was "optimistic" that rescue crews would be able
to lower a basket into the submerged mine shaft by early this
morning. But noting that no definite tapping noises had been detected
since 11:30 Thursday morning, Schweiker added that "we might need a
little help from the Almighty."</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania officials said the long-mine operation was opened by
Black Wolf Coal Co. in 2000. Coal mining had mostly died out in
Somerset County after the 1950s, officials said. But the resurgence
of Appalachian mining after the alarming spike in natural gas prices
in 2000 led the Black Wolf firm to hire 60 miners and drill again
near shafts that had been abandoned for nearly half a century.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Wolf operation is what is known in the coal industry as
a "room and pillar operation," a process in which chambers are dug
out of the underground bituminous coal bed, leaving behind a series
of pillars of coal.</TE>
<TE>   Those pillars remain to support the roof of the mine and allow a
steady air flow.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania state mining records indicate that on Oct. 10, a
40-by-30-foot section of the Black Wolf mine's roofing caved in.
There were no injuries, according to a report filed with the Bureau
of Deep Mine Safety.</TE>
<TE>   In September, 13 miners were killed in explosions at a Brookwood,
Ala., mine. It was the nation's deadliest coal mining accident since
a fire in Utah killed 27 miners in 1984.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Drops Plan to Plead Guilty in Terrorism Plot</HD>
<DH>Courts: He suggests he may have had contacts with
skyjackers but insists he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11
attacks. The about-face sets stage for trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Accused Al Qaeda soldier Zacarias Moussaoui pleaded guilty Thursday
to four counts of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism, then
abruptly withdrew his plea when a judge told him he would be
admitting to knowingly participating in the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui's actions came during the latest in a series of
tumultuous court hearings and set the stage for him to face a jury in
September on charges that he was a willing conspirator in the
worst-ever terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to plead guilty, but you want to link me to certain facts
that will ensure my death," Moussaoui told U.S. District Judge Leonie
M. Brinkema. He added that it is against his Muslim religion to enter
such pleas because it would amount to committing suicide. "Because of
your conditions you put on my guilty plea ... I cannot do this."</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui's four court-appointed lawyers sat by while their
prospective client, who has insisted on representing himself, engaged
in legal arguments with Brinkema for more than 90 minutes. Earlier in
the day, Brinkema rejected the lawyers' efforts to delay the hearing
on the grounds that Moussaoui was not mentally competent to represent
himself in such a complex case.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to trial," said one of the defense lawyers, Frank W.
Dunham Jr., after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff, who was in attendance, had
no comment, but one defense lawyer said Moussaoui's reversal was
clearly a setback for the Justice Department. "It sure would have
made their lives a lot easier if he had pleaded" guilty, said Edward
B. MacMahon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's legal about-face came one week after he stunned the
courtroom by trying to plead guilty to at least some conspiracy
charges. At that time, Brinkema told Moussaoui to take a week to
think about the consequences of admitting to charges that could bring
him the death penalty. Moussaoui indicated then he would not waver
from his intention to plead guilty and that he was a member of Al
Qaeda who had pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Moussaoui, 34, seemed far less defiant than he did a
week before. While admitting to some involvement in terrorist
activities, the French militant of Moroccan descent also insisted he
had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested, for instance, that he spent time in an Al Qaeda camp
in Kandahar and may have provided some training for terrorists and
even food for one of the hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks. He also
said he "may" have received money from one of the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say I might have engaged in these," Moussaoui said, his
palms resting on the lectern as he calmly faced the judge. "But it
doesn't put me on the plane."</TE>
<TE>   While the government has never publicly linked Moussaoui to the 19
hijackers in any specific way, it has accused him of receiving
$14,000 from another suspected co-conspirator, Ramzi Binalshibh, who
authorities say was to be a 20th member of the hijacking teams. When
Binalshibh was prevented from entering the United States, authorities
have suggested, Moussaoui was preparing to take his place on one of
the planes.</TE>
<TE>   But Moussaoui appeared to reject that assertion, saying, "I did
not know [about] Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   In often rambling legal arguments, Moussaoui said he wanted to
plead guilty to four of six counts against him because he expected to
be convicted and wanted a chance to appeal to the jury to spare his
life during the death penalty phase. He would do so, he said, by
going through the lengthy indictment, accusation by accusation, and
indicating where he has been wrongly accused.</TE>
<TE>   "And if 12 people of America find I should be put to jail or put
to death for what I did ... I will receive something that is fair or
remotely fair," Moussaoui said, as his mother watched.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Moussaoui said he would plead guilty to four conspiracy
charges: committing acts of terrorism, aircraft piracy, destroying
aircraft and using weapons of mass destruction. Each charge carries a
maximum penalty of death.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui also faces two other charges: conspiracy to murder U.S.
employees and conspiracy to destroy property.</TE>
<TE>   But as Brinkema went through the specifics of the counts with him,
Moussaoui repeatedly chafed at the judge's comments that he was
formally admitting to being a willing and knowing member of the
skyjacking plot. Finally, Brinkema told him, "You are clearly not
admitting to the essential elements of this conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui asked for a recess to gather his thoughts, and when he
came back, he agreed. "Because of my obligation to my creator, Allah,
and to save and defend my life, I withdraw my guilty plea," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials refused to discuss any prospects for
plea bargain negotiations with Moussaoui and said prosecutors are
moving ahead to the scheduled Sept. 30 trial.</TE>
<TE>   Although Brinkema has indicated to Moussaoui that a plea might be
to his advantage, legal experts Thursday said they doubt the Justice
Department would go for such a deal, especially with Moussaoui
representing himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd have to have an attorney go in and talk to the prosecutors
and offer a proffer," indicating what he would be able to divulge in
exchange for a plea bargain, said Plato Cacheris, a prominent
Washington defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   From a legal standpoint, Moussaoui's aborted guilty plea
ultimately might be the best way of ensuring a fair proceeding,
Cacheris said.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Turley, a defense attorney and a law professor at George
Washington University, agreed that the government is not likely to
seek a plea agreement, even a deal to spare Moussaoui's life in
exchange for information about Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "Most prosecutors are not going to cut a deal with a barking
lunatic," said Turley, noting Moussaoui's barrage of bizarre and
often paranoid legal motions. He said he was "astonished" by
Brinkema's decision finding Moussaoui competent to defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very disturbing thing to have an unhinged individual
presenting a case in a capital punishment matter in this way," Turley
said. "The court refuses to seriously examine his general
incompetence. It's really sort of astonishing, like having a drunk
driver and continually pulling him out of one car and putting him in
another."</TE>

<HD>Ohio State Chooses Its 1st Female President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Ohio State University trustees voted unanimously Thursday to hire the
school's first female president, the latest in a string of
appointments of women as college presidents across the country.</LD>
<LD>   The trustees appointed Karen Holbrook, senior vice president for
academic affairs and provost at the University of Georgia, to run the
nation's second-largest campus.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be very hard to be any more excited than I am right
now," Holbrook, 59, said as she was introduced by board Chairman
James Patterson.</LD>
<TE>   Holbrook will begin Oct. 1 with a salary of $325,000. She will
succeed William Kirwan, who left the Ohio State job to become
chancellor at the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   At least 20 other women have been selected since January to head
U.S. community colleges, four-year schools and universities.</TE>
<TE>   Women have steadily, if slowly, moved into academic management
over the last 25 years, said Claire Van Ummersen, vice president of
the Office of Women in Higher Education at the American Council on
Education.</TE>
<TE>   They made up 5% of college presidents in 1975--almost all at
women's or religious schools. A survey last fall found women
occupying about 22% of the top spots, Van Ummersen said.</TE>
<TE>   Holbrook was selected from a pool of more than 100 candidates,
said Lee Tashjian, Ohio State vice president for university
relations.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State, the state's largest public university, enrolls about
55,000 students, including about 48,000 in Columbus and the rest on
branch campuses. Only the University of Texas at Austin has a larger
main campus.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State has a budget of about $2.5 billion, though lawmakers
cut $28 million from the 2002 budget last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Holbrook was a dean and anatomy professor at the University of
Florida before going to Georgia in 1998. She is a cell biologist who
specializes in embryonic development of human skin.</TE>

<HD>4 Women Halt Paddleboard Crossing of Florida Straits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KEY WEST, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Halfway across the Florida Straits, bad weather forced four women on
Thursday to abandon their attempt to paddle to Key West from Cuba
with their hands, on an 18-foot board.</LD>
<LD>   The women had hoped to break a men's world record in
paddleboarding set last year of 20 hours and two minutes for the
112-mile voyage.</LD>
<LD>   But they gave up about halfway across because of storms and
lightning, organizers said. The captain of the support boat made the
decision to pull them out of the water.</LD>
<TE>   The four would have been the first female paddleboarders to make
the dangerous crossing frequently attempted by Cubans leaving the
communist-run island on boats, rafts and inner tubes.</TE>
<TE>   The team was led by Ramona d'Viola, 43, of Santa Cruz and included
Brazilian-born Aline Paterson, 27, from Deerfield Beach, Fla.;
Montreal-born Christine McCrady, 28; Kelley Jo Helt, 25, originally
from Pennsylvania; and, alternate April Noon, 23, from Fort
Lauderdale.</TE>

<HD>2 Arrested in Philadelphia Kidnapping</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Acting on a tip, police Thursday arrested two men wanted in the
kidnapping for ransom of Erica Pratt, the 7-year-old girl who
authorities say escaped from her captors by gnawing through duct
tape.</LD>
<LD>   Both men have long criminal records, and police said they were
investigating whether the abduction was the work of a drug gang.</LD>
<LD>   James Burns, 29, and Edward Johnson, 23, were captured before
dawn, blocks from where Erica was abducted Monday night while playing
with her 5-year-old sister in front of their grandmother's house.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged kidnappers apparently knew the Pratt family. The
connection was unclear, but court records show that the family had at
least one violent run-in with one of the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators continued to hunt for other suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that we will have additional arrests within a week,"
said Lt. Michael Chitwood.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the girl was kidnapped, her captors called her
grandmother and demanded $150,000 to spare her life. Bound and
blindfolded with duct tape in the squalid basement of an empty
building, Erica clawed loose Tuesday, broke open a door and yelled
for help, police said. Two neighborhood children helped her break
through a window to safety, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police would not say why the Pratt family was singled out, but
they said they were investigating whether the kidnappers believed
false neighborhood rumors that the Pratts, who live in a blighted
block in a poor neighborhood, had come into money.</TE>
<TE>   "The motive was definitely money," Chitwood said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Burns was charged with trying to shoot Erica's uncle
Derrick Pratt by spraying his West Philadelphia home with bullets.
Burns was released on bail and failed to show up for a court
appearance. He was still wanted in that case at the time of the
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Pratt was acquitted in a double-murder in the 1990s. In
February, he was wounded with three other people in a drive-by
shooting outside a downtown hotel. Another Pratt uncle was killed in
March in what police described as a gangland murder.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had been arrested on drug charges in 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Pratt family would not talk about their past
history with the suspected kidnappers Wednesday, other than to
acknowledge that they had known both men from the neighborhood for
many years.</TE>
<TE>   Police would not discuss the evidence they said links the two men
to the crime, but said Erica had picked Johnson's picture out of a
photo array and identified him as the man who dragged her away
kicking and screaming.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on a tip, police spotted the men in a car just blocks from
the Pratt home. The men bolted but were captured after a foot chase,
police said. Johnson tried to hide by lying on the roof of a parking
garage.</TE>

<HD>Congress OKs Corporate Reforms</HD>
<DH>Business: Measure wins quick approval, as more action is
vowed to help restore confidence in the economy. Bush sees a 'victory
for America's shareholders.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House and Senate overwhelmingly approved a sweeping business
reform bill Thursday, and lawmakers pledged to consider more measures
aimed at punishing corporate crime and restoring confidence in the
economy.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush called the congressional action a "victory for
America's shareholders and employees." His signature on the bill,
expected within the next few days, will usher in the most significant
strengthening of business regulation since the Depression era.</LD>
<LD>   After a sustained slide, the stock market had recorded huge gains
Wednesday that were credited in part to word of the bill's
anticipated passage. That enthusiasm was tamed Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 246 points by
early afternoon, then recovered most of that to close with a small
loss, 4.98 points at 8,186.31.</TE>
<TE>   The market's performance underscored doubts about the impact the
reform bill will have, at least initially, in easing investor
concerns sparked by corporate scandals. Experts said it was still too
early to say whether the worst bear market in a generation had
finally hit bottom.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, lawmakers worried about the political fallout
from continued market turmoil quickly focused on the next steps they
can take.</TE>
<TE>   These could include passing a pension reform bill, extending to
dishonest corporate executives a law used to seize the assets of drug
kingpins and cracking down on offshore tax havens. Also possible is a
bid to require companies to account for stock options on their books,
a proposal that was blocked from the bill that cleared Congress on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The House passed the measure, 423 to 3. The Senate quickly
followed suit, approving it 99 to 0.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation creates an independent board to oversee the
accounting industry, requires corporate officers to attest to the
accuracy of their company's financial statements and limits the
consulting that accounting firms can do for companies they audit. It
also bans personal loans from companies to their executives and
mandates new rules to prevent conflicts of interest among Wall Street
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "Our markets will be stronger tomorrow than they were this
morning" because of the legislation, predicted Sen. Charles E.
Schumer (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting a strong desire to toughen treatment of white-collar
criminals, the measure makes it easier to prosecute securities fraud
and establishes prison sentences of up to 25 years for corporate
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's message from Congress to CEOs and corporate boardrooms is
clear," said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.): "If you steal,
cheat or commit some other white-collar crime, you'll face the same
consequences as lawbreaking street thugs by spending time behind
bars."</TE>
<TE>   Barely more than a month ago, the reform bill's prospects had
appeared uncertain, with Congress deeply divided along partisan lines
over how much more government regulation of business was needed. That
changed after the revelation in late June of accounting
irregularities by WorldCom Inc., reports of other corporate misdeeds
and the stock market decline.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's lopsided votes for the reform bill were testament to
the powerful political winds now blowing from Wall Street and Main
Street to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "This really is quite a new environment," said Rep. Richard H.
Baker (R-La.). "My constituents are asking where are the leg irons"
for corporate wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   The three House members voting against the bill, all Republicans,
were Mac Collins of Georgia, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ron Paul of
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), the bill's chief architect, said it
is the "first big step" in restoring stability to the marketplace and
the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But with the accounting scandals costing investors billions of
dollars, the conduct of corporate America is expected to remain a hot
issue as the political battle heats up for control of the House and
Senate in this November's election.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Basham, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute,
said he expects Congress' next target to be companies that move their
legal address to tax havens like Bermuda to avoid U.S. taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the Republicans have dumped their ideology overboard on
this issue and are rowing furiously toward their version of
'Political Paradise Island,' namely stockholder-friendly voting
records for the fall campaign," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled House earlier this year passed a bill
that would give employees new rights to sell company stock and
diversify investments in their 401(k) retirement accounts. It was
enacted in response to huge losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees
whose retirement accounts consisted heavily of company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Thursday called on the Democrat-controlled Senate to act
quickly on its version of the pension reform bill. Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) already has indicated it will be at the
top of his agenda when lawmakers return from their summer recess in
early September.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle also on Thursday renewed his promise to schedule a Senate
vote later this year on a proposal that could lead to treating stock
options as a cost on company books.</TE>
<TE>   Stock options, which give employees the right to buy company
shares at a set price in the future, have become a popular form of
executive compensation. But companies are not required to count
options as an expense on their books, a practice critics say obscures
a full picture of a company's financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   High-tech firms led the lobbying effort that kept the proposal out
of the bill passed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, Baker said he would seek to force executives
convicted of fraud to sell their assets and use the proceeds to
reimburse defrauded investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not enough that after we catch you we put you away for a
long time," said Baker, chairman of the House Financial Services
subcommittee on capital markets. "We want to make sure those
mansions, those benefits, those golden parachutes are collapsed,
folded up neatly, put into a closet and sold off so that the
shareholders back home can get their hands on their money."</TE>
<TE>   A provision of the legislation approved Thursday would set up a
fund to reimburse defrauded investors from fines paid by corporate
wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission collected about
$50 million from fines and so-called disgorgements of ill-gotten
gains from companies.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said he also wants to give the SEC the authority to seize
assets of executives. The law currently is applied mainly to drug
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said he and other lawmakers "are going to continue to work
to make sure that no one who is defrauded by an irresponsible act of
corporate abuse does not get full recompense for the wrong."</TE>

<HD>Homeland Bill Faces Veto Threat</HD>
<DH>Security: White House claims certain provisions in the
Senate Democrats' plan would result in 'micromanagement.' Move
surprises sponsor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As Congress continued its rapid march toward action on President
Bush's proposed Department of Homeland Security, the White House on
Thursday issued a veto threat against a bill written by Senate
Democrats to create the new agency.</LD>
<LD>   Late Thursday, the House opened debate on a GOP-drafted homeland
security bill that is mostly to the president's liking. Lawmakers,
however, faced votes on several controversial amendments. House
leaders aimed to win passage of their bill today.</LD>
<LD>   The rupture over the Democratic legislation surprised its main
sponsor, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. Lieberman has been
one of the strongest backers of the president's push to reorganize
the government in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   But White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush advisors
will recommend a veto if Congress approves language in Lieberman's
bill that the president opposes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the objectionable provisions, Fleischer told reporters, are
limits on the administration's ability to hire and fire personnel in
the new department and the creation of a new anti-terrorist post
within the White House subject to Senate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a non-starter for this president," Fleischer warned.
"That's micromanagement of the White House by the Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, who moved his legislation through committee this week,
said he was dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some disagreements," he told reporters. "We will continue
to work on them. I can't believe frankly that the president would
veto the bill over this."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, one of the first in Congress to propose a Cabinet-level
Homeland Security agency, joined with Bush to press for congressional
action immediately after the president announced his own plan for
such an agency June 6.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said 90% of his bill includes what Bush proposed. For
instance, he agrees with Bush that the department should include the
Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Customs
Service, the Transportation Security Administration and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, among other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is scheduled to debate Lieberman's bill next week. The
Governmental Affairs Committee, which he heads, endorsed the bill
Thursday on a 12-5 vote. Three Republicans--Sens. Susan Collins of
Maine, Ted Stevens of Alaska and George Voinovich of Ohio--joined all
nine Democrats in favor.</TE>
<TE>   While the veto threat could signal a showdown, it may also serve
to reinforce Republican support for White House positions as homeland
security legislation moves to the House and Senate floors.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, in fact, the House began to debate its own version.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 26 amendments the House was scheduled to consider were
proposals to keep FEMA independent, strengthen congressional
oversight of a White House Homeland Security office and reaffirm
congressional support of a 19th century law banning the use of
federal troops for domestic law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The last amendment, sponsored by House Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), was seen as a rebuke of the White House, which earlier
this month had called for a review of the military-limits law, known
as "posse comitatus."</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, House Republicans said they aimed to back
the president. In their opening speeches, they emphasized the potent
theme of security, a rallying cry that has racked up huge majorities
for other post-Sept. 11 bills.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William M. "Mac" Thornberry (R-Texas), arguing for the GOP
bill, urged lawmakers to set aside politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember," he said, "what we're trying to do is create an
integrated Department of Homeland Security to make us safer."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): "We cannot make ourselves immune
from terrorism, but we can make our country safer."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats were of two minds. Many said they wanted to support the
bill, but objected to GOP provisions that would limit liability for
businesses that deal with homeland security and grant the
administration new powers in the management of the department.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas) called on Republicans to "join us in
cleaning up this bill" in an effort to create "a strong, effective
department."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) assailed a provision in the
legislation to extend by one year a Dec. 31 deadline to install
bomb-detection equipment at the nation's airports for checked
baggage. "Excuses and delays will not be tolerated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some Democrats attacked the bill as fundamentally flawed.
"Basically, this is political cover over an operational problem,"
said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio). "We don't need another federal
department."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said that the legislation
"may well cause more problems than it solves.... We're getting more
bureaucracy and we're doing so at tremendous cost to the taxpayers."</TE>

<HD>Federal Agent Admits Slurs, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Secret Service: Veteran employee is accused of scrawling
anti-Muslim graffiti while searching the home of a smuggling suspect
in Michigan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>A Secret Service agent has admitted he scrawled anti-Muslim
statements on a prayer calendar during the home search of a man
charged with smuggling bogus checks into the United States,
authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The incident took place when agents searched the Dearborn, Mich.,
home of Omar Shishani, who has pleaded not guilty to bringing $12
million in forged cashier's checks on a flight from Indonesia.</LD>
<LD>   "This type of unprofessional behavior by a federal agent will not
be tolerated," said Jeffrey Collins, the U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of Michigan.</LD>
<TE>   Shishani's brother, Abdallah Shishani, said he and his wife found
that "Islam is Evil" and "Christ is King" had been written on the
prayer calendar attached to the refrigerator. Abdallah Shishani, 44,
and his wife have been staying at the house since Omar Shishani's
arrest, baby-sitting the man's 8-year-old twins.</TE>
<TE>   Collins would not identify the agent but said he had been a Secret
Service special agent for about 10 years. He was put on leave pending
the investigation, and officials said he could be fired and face
criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous that one of our law enforcers who swears to serve
and protect is making religious slurs against individuals," said Omar
Shishani's attorney, Nabih Ayad.</TE>
<TE>   The Jordanian-born Shishani was arrested July 17; authorities say
they found nine phony cashier's checks in his bags. They also say he
later told them he could provide information about terrorism and that
the name on the checks might belong to a member of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Ayad denied those claims and said his client didn't know the
checks were fraudulent. He said Shishani is a broker who was in
Indonesia on business.</TE>
<TE>   Shishani is jailed without bond on charges of possessing
counterfeit securities and smuggling merchandise into the United
States. He faces as much as 15 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights and
advocacy group, had asked Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to investigate the
graffiti incident.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased with the Secret Service's quick response in
initiating an investigation into this matter," spokeswoman Hodan
Hassan said.</TE>

<HD>Study Targets Factors in Quitting Smoking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Seven in 10 adult smokers in the United States say they want to
quit--but their success in kicking the habit varies widely by race
and education, the government said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A study of more than 32,000 adults in 2000 found that about 23.3%
were smokers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
That was down slightly from 25% in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Among those defined as smokers--people who had smoked at least 100
cigarettes in their lives and still smoke regularly--70% said they
would like to quit.</LD>
<TE>   But the study revealed broad demographic gaps: Of whites who
smoked at some point in their lives, 51% were able to quit, compared
with 37% of blacks, 43% of Latinos and 45% of Asian Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The success rate for quitting generally rose by education level.
Fewer than half of high school dropouts said they had smoked and
quit, compared with 64% of college graduates and 74% of people with
graduate degrees.</TE>
<TE>   There was a similar trend when researchers broke down the results
by income. Roughly half of people at or above the poverty line had
quit smoking, compared with just one-third below the line.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC said the cost of anti-smoking medication and unequal
access to quality health care that includes anti-tobacco counseling
probably accounts for the gap.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in overall smoking since 1993 is significant, the CDC
said. But health officials have a long way to go: They want to see
the rate drop to 12% by 2010.</TE>

<HD>Health Care Tax Break Clears House</HD>
<DH>Congress: The bill would defray costs of long-term
insurance for mid-income taxpayers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A tax deduction to help middle-income people defray the cost of
insurance for long-term health care, such as a nursing home, won
passage Thursday in the House.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, approved on a 362-61 vote, would permit the
deduction for a taxpayer, a taxpayer's spouse or a dependent and it
would apply whether or not the taxpayer itemizes tax deductions. The
tax break would reduce federal revenue by about $5.3 billion over 10
years.</LD>
<LD>   Current law permits long-term health insurance premiums to be
deducted, but a taxpayer must itemize and the amount that can be
deducted must be more than 7.5% of income when combined with all
other medical expenses.</LD>
<TE>   The deduction would be limited to individuals earning from $20,000
to $40,000 in adjusted gross income and from $40,000 to $80,000 for
married couples filing jointly. In addition, the taxpayer would have
to pay at least half of the insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.), said the
deduction would encourage more people to use private insurance to pay
for such things as nursing homes and assisted living arrangements
instead of relying so much on Medicare and Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the overwhelming vote in favor, Rep. Pete Stark
(D-Hayward) said the measure would help relatively few people at a
great cost and it appeared designed to "bail out the insurance
industry."</TE>
<TE>   "It's worthless ... ," Stark said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would also permit an additional 2002 personal tax
exemption, worth $3,000, for members of a taxpayer's family who are
long-term caregivers and would expand the types of expenses drug
manufacturers can claim as a tax credit in testing drugs for certain
rare diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation heads to the Senate, where its chances are
uncertain.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Sen. Torricelli May End Next Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The chairman of the ethics panel investigating Sen. Robert Torricelli
said Thursday that the panel could reach a decision next week and
that the New Jersey Democrat will be its only witness.</LD>
<LD>   The ethics panel, made up of three Republican and three Democratic
senators, met with Torricelli and his lawyer for nearly three hours
on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The committee is investigating allegations that Torricelli
accepted gifts and cash from a campaign contributor, David Chang,
and, in return, helped Chang with business dealings overseas.</LD>
<TE>   The committee chairman, Democratic Sen. Daniel K. Inouye of
Hawaii, said he is hopeful the committee will reach a conclusion next
week. Its options include disciplining Torricelli or closing the case
with no action.</TE>
<TE>   Inouye said Torricelli probably has made his final appearance in
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Chang is serving a prison sentence for making illegal donations to
Torricelli in 1996. He has said Torricelli demanded donations and
expensive gifts in exchange for assisting him in business ventures in
North and South Korea, which the senator denies.</TE>

<HD>Congress Comes to Terms on 'Fast-Track' Trade Status for
Bush</HD>
<DH>Pact: Bill would expand presidential authority to seek new
international agreements. Breakthrough deal is reached in marathon
sessions on Capitol Hill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a legislative breakthrough for the Bush administration,
congressional negotiators announced a deal late Thursday on a bill
that would expand presidential authority to seek new international
trade agreements.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of an accord to grant President Bush "fast-track" trade
authority were finished just before midnight after marathon talks,
lawmakers said. The House could vote as early as today on a final
version of the bill, with Senate action expected soon afterward.</LD>
<LD>   Securing House passage would be a large feat in an election year;
twice in recent months, the House has moved forward on the
legislation by a mere one-vote margin. Most House Republicans have
voted for the bill, while most Democrats have been opposed.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, and Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, shook hands on the deal late Thursday, with
other senior lawmakers also in agreement, aides said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have an agreement," Thomas told reporters
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Siegel, a finance committee spokesman, concurred, saying,
"We've got an agreement. This is it."</TE>
<TE>   Baucus, Siegel said, believed the deal represented "a significant
victory for American workers, for our economy and also for U.S. trade
prestige." The Senate aide said the deal included many Senate-crafted
provisions providing federal aid--including a health-insurance
subsidy--to workers left jobless in industries vulnerable to foreign
trade.</TE>
<TE>   If a bill clears Congress, it would be a huge victory for the Bush
administration's economic agenda. It also could stimulate global
trade talks launched last year at an international conference in
Qatar, as well as jump-starting efforts to create a free trade zone
spanning the Western Hemisphere. Those developments would counter a
recent trend of protectionism that has dimmed hopes for easing global
trade barriers.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the bill at issue would allow Bush to negotiate
bilateral, regional or global trade deals and bring them to Congress
for approval on an up-or-down vote, with no amendments allowed.</TE>
<TE>   From 1974 to 1994, every president held such power. It was
instrumental, for example, in securing approval of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which took effect Jan. 1, 1994, and of the
global accord that created the World Trade Organization a year later.</TE>
<TE>   But for the last eight years, presidents have not held fast-track
authority. President Clinton, a free-trader, tried and failed to
renew it. Bush, likewise in favor of opening markets, made it a
priority shortly after he took office last year.</TE>
<TE>   With concerns about the effects of globalization rising in recent
years, lawmakers have become increasingly zealous in guarding their
role in regulating foreign commerce, a power expressly granted
Congress under the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Although many lawmakers have sympathized with pleas from the
business community to expand presidential trade authority as a way to
gain access to foreign markets, others have been deeply suspicious of
free trade. These critics say that more U.S. jobs are lost than
gained when foreign imports swamp markets here.</TE>
<TE>   The House in December and the Senate in May passed very different
versions of the trade bill. Unlike the GOP-drafted House bill, the
bipartisan measure that emerged from the Democrat-led Senate would
greatly expand federal aid to workers left jobless because of foreign
competition. In one key Senate provision, for example, these
dislocated workers would be eligible for a federal subsidy of as much
as 70% of the cost of their health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The original House bill contained no such subsidy; subsequently,
House GOP leaders embraced a 60% subsidy, but under conditions
substantially different from those proposed in the Senate version. In
another key sticking point, the Senate bill also included a provision
allowing the Senate to amend or remove language that would weaken
trade laws protecting domestic industries from unfair foreign
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The administration strenuously opposed this provision--known as
the Dayton-Craig amendment--as antithetical to fast-track, saying
that it would cripple the country's ability to promote trade
liberalization around the world because other governments would be
unwilling to strike deals that could be picked apart by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   This week, at Bush's urging, lawmakers accelerated their search
for compromise, as Congress is due to break within days for an
extended summer recess. On Wednesday and Thursday, Baucus, Thomas and
other key negotiators met late into the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Early Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
dampened hopes for a breakthrough. Daschle said House GOP offers
would not do enough to help displaced workers. A supporter of the
Senate bill, which passed 66 to 30, Daschle said he could wait until
September or October if necessary to reach an accord.</TE>
<TE>   The White House sharply criticized Daschle's statement and urged
lawmakers to press ahead as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-trade advocates also were applying pressure. Calman Cohen,
head of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, said: "At a time
when there is extreme nervousness about the state of our markets, the
need to do everything that can be done to expand our economy is
pressing on these members and the White House."</TE>

<HD>Traficant's Seat in House Will Remain Vacant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Gov. Robert A. Taft said Thursday he would not call a special
election to fill the remaining months of Rep. James A. Traficant
Jr.'s term, citing what he said were excessive costs to taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant was expelled by the House on Wednesday by a 420-1 vote
for ethics violations stemming from his conviction on federal charges
of bribery, kickbacks and tax evasion.</LD>
<LD>   Before he went on trial, Traficant's district in northeast Ohio
was carved up as the state reshuffled boundary lines to account for
the loss of one House seat because of U.S. population shifts.</LD>
<TE>   Traficant, a nine-term Democrat, plans to run as an independent in
a new district that includes a chunk of his old one. But his
expulsion left his current district, which will exist on paper only
until January, without a representative.</TE>
<TE>   Taft said it would cost $800,000 to hold a special election to
fill Traficant's seat until his term would have expired in January.</TE>
<TE>   Such an election "could result in significant cost and has the
potential for wide-scale voter confusion.... It is simply unfair to
ask these taxpayers to expend such an enormous amount of money to
elect a representative who would serve them only a few weeks," Taft
said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant is only the second House member since the Civil War to
be tossed out of Congress.</TE>

<HD>Tuna Risk to Pregnancy Is Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELTSVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>The government should tell pregnant women to limit their consumption
of tuna because of concern that eating lots of the fish could expose
an unborn baby's developing brain to possibly harmful mercury levels,
scientific advisors recommended Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   It is not clear how much tuna women should eat, the advisors
said--perhaps two 6-ounce cans a week if that is the only fish they
eat, or a single can if other seafood, which also can contain
mercury, is part of their diet.</LD>
<LD>   The panel urged the Food and Drug Administration to quickly study
what proportion of the mercury in a woman's diet comes from tuna so
more precise advice can be given. In the interim, extra care was
suggested.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to tell people to stop eating tuna fish," said the
panel chairman, Sanford Miller of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
"We're trying to balance the very positive virtues of fish, including
tuna fish, with the harms. It's a very hard balance to make."</TE>
<TE>   Industry representatives testified that few pregnant women eat
enough fish, much less tuna, to absorb worrisome mercury levels.</TE>

<HD>Domestic Violence Poses 'Double Jeopardy'</HD>
<DH>Workplace: The toll of abuse costs some victims their jobs.
Senate panel considers protections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Kathy Evsich learned the hard way that, as a victim of domestic
violence, finding an ally in an employer was rare.</LD>
<LD>   She was fired twice because her employers wouldn't tolerate the
hourly phone calls from her husband. Nor could they contend with his
drive-by harassment, his threats to them or their fears that other
employees could be harmed. But in November 1999, Evsich obtained a
restraining order, found a job as a cashier and began building a nest
egg so she and her two children could move away.</LD>
<LD>   Her husband responded by driving to the grocery store where she
worked and, using a car rented expressly for the purpose, running her
down. Then he stabbed her four times, damaging her heart and her
lungs.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Evsich--now vice president of Women Against Domestic
Violence, an activist group based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.--came to
Capitol Hill to tell her story to the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions, which is considering amendments to
welfare reform legislation dealing with victims of domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Workplaces need to know and understand the dynamics of abuse,"
she said. "The whole aim of an abuser is to make a victim solely
dependent on them so she can't leave.</TE>
<TE>   "She can't buy clothes for her children, she can't buy food for
her children unless she has a job. Employers need to understand
that."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), who convened the hearing, described
the "double jeopardy" of domestic violence: "Too often women are
forced to choose between protecting themselves from abuse and keeping
a roof over their head," he said. No one should "face the double
tragedy of first being abused and then losing a job, health insurance
or any other means of self-sufficiency because they were abused."</TE>
<TE>   At present, only California, Colorado and Maine have laws allowing
victims of domestic violence to take leaves of absence from their
jobs. Colorado and Maine extend the provisions to victims of stalkers
and sexual assault, said Kathy Rodgers, president of the National
Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund. A similar
proposal has passed the California Assembly and is now before the
state Senate, Rodgers said.</TE>
<TE>   Although 18 states, including California, have passed laws
providing unemployment insurance to employees who leave jobs because
of domestic violence, victims often can't claim unemployment,
welfare, or Family and Medical Leave Act benefits, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2.8 million people are victimized by intimate partners
annually, according to a 2000 Department of Justice report. Homicide
is the leading cause of death on the job for women, and more than 20%
of those crimes are committed by their husbands or boyfriends, Diane
Stuart, director of the Department of Justice's Violence Against
Women office, told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Still, only "a very small number" of companies have programs to
help victims of violence, according to the NOW legal defense fund.
For Sidney Harman, co-founder of Harman International Industries
Inc., a Washington-based high-end audio technology company, it took
the death of a 24-year employee to force an executive decision.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Duran, a 56-year-old worker at the Fortune 500 company, was
gunned down in May 2001 by her former husband as she was returning
home from work. Harman approached the Family Violence Prevention
Fund, part of the Justice Department, and local police to develop a
program that would train employees to offer information and referrals
on domestic violence. The company also developed internal security
systems to protect confidentiality and prevent situations where
employees could be physically harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses pay an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion a year in
medical expenses caused by domestic violence, according to the Bureau
of National Affairs. The National Health Resource Center for Domestic
Violence reports that 94% of corporate security directors rank it as
a high security problem; 71% of human resources and security
personnel surveyed have had an incident of domestic violence occur on
company property.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent workplace violence, employers can change an employee's
phone extension or route calls through a receptionist. Registering
protective orders with building security or transferring the employee
to another site may also help, experts said. Stuart, of the Justice
Department, called on communities to create teams of lawyers, shelter
providers and community members to help employers devise plans. The
Victims' Economic Security and Safety Act--comprehensive measures
introduced last year that proponents say extend government benefits
to victims of domestic violence--has been referred to committee but
has not been heard. Instead, senators, including Wellstone, aim to
get some of its provisions included in welfare reform legislation up
for renewal in September.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing Thursday was not well-attended, partly because of a
nearby homeland security meeting. But those senators who came said
they would continue the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can forget these women today," said Sen. Patty
Murray (D-Wash.). "For them, homeland security has an entirely
different meaning."</TE>

<HD>Yale Accuses Princeton in Hack Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yale University told the FBI on Thursday that fellow Ivy League
institution Princeton hacked into its online admissions notification
system and looked through student files during the peak college
admissions period in April.</LD>
<LD>   Princeton apologized for the snooping, suspended its director of
admissions and promised to conduct an internal investigation and
cooperate with other investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Yale said Princeton admissions officials used students' birth
dates and Social Security numbers, apparently gleaned from the
students' Princeton applications, to see confidential admissions
decisions on 11 students who applied to both universities.</LD>
<TE>   "We got information today from Yale, and we're in the process of
assessing the situation to determine if federal violations occurred,"
said Lisa Bull, spokeswoman for the FBI in New Haven.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Princeton officials knew before the students
whether they had been admitted to Yale. And because of the way the
Yale Web site is set up, Princeton's intrusions made it difficult for
the students themselves to go online and learn whether they were in,
said Chris Michel, a Northern California senior who is editor in
chief of the Yale Daily News. That paper broke the story Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Yale nor Princeton offered a motive for the snooping, but
some speculated that Princeton was hoping to use confidential
information on the Yale site to court applicants to Princeton. It
wasn't clear what Princeton might have gained from so few intrusions.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen LeMenager, Princeton's director of admissions, told the
Yale Daily News that the snooping was an innocent way to evaluate the
system's security.</TE>
<TE>   A disclaimer on the site specifically prohibits anyone but the
applicant from logging in.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Clark, a Yale junior who designed the system and
conducted a security audit after the unauthorized use was discovered,
said the disclaimer was intended to warn off curious parents and
guidance counselors. "We certainly did not want anyone accessing the
site without the applicant's prior authorization," he said.</TE>
<TE>   LeMenager told the Yale newspaper that such concerns were what
prompted his office to look on the site in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, Princeton violated student privacy, said
Dorothy Robinson, Yale vice president and general counsel. No other
security breaches were detected.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Marks, spokeswoman for Princeton, said the snooping
represented "a serious lapse of judgment by at least one member of
our admissions staff.... The improper use of information provided to
the university in good faith may have affected the ability of
students to obtain information about their admission to Yale,
something we deeply regret."</TE>
<TE>   The action stunned many in the college admissions world.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it wild? Can you believe the egg on the face?" said Paul
Kanarek, who runs the Orange County chapter of the Princeton Review,
which is not affiliated with the university. "Clearly, human nature
got the better of human judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Reider, a former Stanford admissions official who is now
director of college counseling at a Bay Area high school, said:
"There's tremendous competition from the inside that isn't apparent
from the outside. This is a little crack in that facade."</TE>
<TE>   Michel, of the Yale Daily News, said officials learned of the
snooping when Princeton officials mentioned it at a dean's conference
in June.</TE>
<TE>   A Yale investigation found records of 18 log-ins from Princeton
computers from April 3 to 16.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site, which was activated in December for early-decision
students and again for two weeks in April for general admission, was
used by 1,200 of the approximately 1,500 admitted students. Thousands
of other prospective students also used it to find out they had not
been admitted.</TE>
<TE>   At the first log-on, successful applicants heard the Yale fight
song, "Bulldog Bulldog, Bow Wow Wow." Students also were invited to
list academic and extracurricular interests.</TE>
<TE>   That screen did not pop up after the first log-on, which meant
that if Princeton had viewed students' files first, the students
might have had trouble figuring out they had been admitted.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very discouraging as a student," Michel said. "A
relationship between a university and a student is based on trust,
not least of which is providing sensitive information, like birth
dates."</TE>
<TE>   The courts have broadly interpreted computer access as
unauthorized if the intruder doesn't have the computer owner's
permission, said Jennifer Granick, litigation director for the
Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society. The fact that
the system had a warning makes Princeton vulnerable to a lawsuit, but
criminal charges, which require criminal intent, aren't likely, she
said.</TE>

<HD>E. Coli Soars in Preemies; Strep Drops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a boomerang effect apparently caused by antibiotics, E. coli is
rising among premature babies and has overtaken strep as the most
common infection in such infants, a study published Thursday
suggests.</LD>
<LD>   The shift is worrisome because E. coli bacteria can be more deadly
than streptococcus germs.</LD>
<LD>   The rate of group B streptococcus blood infections in newborn
preemies fell by nearly three-quarters during the 1990s, probably
because more women in labor now get antibiotics to keep from passing
the bacteria on to their babies during delivery, the study said.</LD>
<TE>   During that same period, the rate of E. coli infections doubled,
apparently because ampicillin, the antibiotic commonly used to wipe
out strep, gave E. coli room to flourish, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. It was led
by Dr. Barbara J. Stoll, professor of pediatrics at Emory University
School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Group B strep and E. coli are among the bacteria that live
harmlessly in many people's intestinal tracts. If they spread into a
woman's vagina during pregnancy, though, they can overwhelm the
newborn's weak immune system, sometimes causing mental retardation,
hearing or vision loss, or death.</TE>
<TE>   NIH scientists and doctors at about a dozen hospitals and medical
schools compared 5,447 very low-birth-weight infants born from 1998
through 2000 with 7,606 similar births from 1991 through 1993. Very
low birth weight is defined as 3 1/2 pounds or less.</TE>
<TE>   E. coli infections rose from 3 per 1,000 births to 7 per 1,000
births, while group B strep infections dropped from 5.9 per 1,000
births to 1.7 per 1,000 births. The overall rate of sepsis dropped
from 19.3 per 1,000 births to 15.4 per 1,000 births.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers studied records on 5,144 babies born at about 170
hospitals around the country.</TE>

<HD>Los Alamitos Has to Be Creative, but Payoff Is Big</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The business of keeping Los Alamitos Race Course alive has required
some creativity.</LD>
<LD>   The small Orange County track operates at night because, by then,
most other facilities, especially those on the East Coast, have
closed. That gives Los Alamitos a corner on the simulcast market, all
those fans watching on television around the nation, accounting for
70% of the daily bets.</LD>
<LD>   "If people want to gamble," marketing director Jeff True said,
"we're the last track running."</LD>
<TE>   Los Alamitos has pushed this advantage by helping TVG network set
up a studio on its premises. TVG broadcasts to more than 8 million
homes via satellite and selected cable companies, attracting an
additional $75,000 in wagers a night over the telephone and Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the track draws an average of only 1,516 fans and $1.2
million in bets each night, far below Santa Anita with its averages
of 10,486 fans and $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   So when Los Alamitos officials decided to stage the richest annual
race in California, they turned to an arrangement called a futurity,
something the larger, wealthier thoroughbred tracks do not have.
Here's how it works:</TE>
<TE>   Track owner Edward Allred starts by putting up $250,000 of his own
money. That's enough to get horsemen interested.</TE>
<TE>   Owners with young prospects pay a nominating fee at the beginning
of the year. They continue to make small payments, all the while
gambling their horses will qualify through a series of elimination
races to be among the 10-horse field in the Los Alamitos Million
Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction? A huge payday come December.</TE>
<TE>   "They know the money is out there," said Orlando Gutierrez, a
track spokesman. "And when enough owners get together, the pot starts
building."</TE>
<TE>   This year, 199 owners have nominated 332 horses, paying as much as
$3,050 per horse. The estimated purse is $1.3 million.</TE>

<HD>First Time a Charm for Avenger Coach</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Hodgkiss believed his rookie year as an Arena
League head coach would include a playoff appearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ed Hodgkiss became head coach of the Avengers in October, he was
convinced the team could make the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't have many believers outside of the Avengers. After all,
the third-year Arena Football League team had won only eight of 28
games. Although Hodgkiss had been in the league since 1997 with
Indiana, he never had been a head coach.</LD>
<LD>   But Hodgkiss, 31, was true to his word. The Avengers reached the
league's 2002 playoffs by finishing third in the Western Division
with an 8-6 record. On Saturday, the fifth-seeded Avengers play host
to 12th-seeded Tampa Bay at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want to say we overachieved this year," Hodgkiss said.
"This is where I expected us to be, if not higher. I think we've
played to the best of our ability many times. If I had to give us an
overall assessment, I'd say I'm happy where we're at. I think we're
strong going into the playoffs. It's been a long road, but in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Hodgkiss, the team's third coach following Stan Brock and Robert
Lyles, came to Los Angeles with the reputation as one of the league's
top coaching prospects. He was offensive coordinator his last three
seasons with the Firebirds, who won the Arena Bowl in 1999 and were
always among the top scoring teams.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgkiss had similar success this season in Los Angeles. In 2001,
the Avengers ranked 18th in scoring (40.3) and 17th in total offense
(245.6 yards). This season, the team finished fifth in scoring (52.2
points) and fourth in total offense (275.6). The Avengers also
lowered opponents' scoring average from 51.1 points in 2001 to 49.6.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt, it would have been a big disappointment to me for us
not to make the playoffs," Hodgkiss said. "Especially this year, with
16 teams in the league and 12 making [the playoffs]. If we stayed
healthy, I firmly believed we would outwork and out-character at
least four teams over the course of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Still, no coach knows how his first season will work out when
inheriting a team. Half of the Avengers' 24-man roster this season
came from somewhere else. Only two players, Anthony Rice and Chris
Jackson, remained from the team's inaugural season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a credit to Ed and his staff that they brought us together
as quickly as they did," quarterback Tony Graziani said. "Coach
stressed chemistry and togetherness, and I know a lot of people say
those words. But he came in here with respect from what he did at
Indiana. It made us want to try things his way."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his staff, Hodgkiss said he drew on two other resources
this season.</TE>
<TE>   One was his head coach at Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "My mentor," Hodgkiss said of Mike Daily. "I have great respect
for him, and we run similar type programs. I didn't talk to him a ton
this year, maybe three, four times during the season. But I was with
him for so long, and he prepared me very well."</TE>
<TE>   The other was famed UCLA basketball coach John Wooden.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never met him, but I draw from him, too," Hodgkiss said. "I
do all the Wooden stuff, like worrying about yourself, practicing
well, playing to the best of your ability. I've gotten all that from
reading and studying Wooden. I'm like a Wooden disciple.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he's from a different sport. But that's a guy, as a head
coach, I took a lot of notes from. I give the players quotes from
Wooden and really try to follow his footsteps on how he approached
games and everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Now he will try to lead the Avengers to a place they've never
been. Tampa Bay comes into the playoffs with a 6-8 record, which
includes a 38-24 loss to the Avengers on May 17. But the Storm, which
has won four Arena Bowls, is making a league-record 12th consecutive
playoff appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I know [Storm] Coach Tim Marcum has the motivation since we beat
them," Hodgkiss said. "We have to guard against that. But it goes
back to focusing on ourselves. If we don't turn the ball over, [if
we] play physical and tackle well, I think we're going to be fine.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I focus on us--that way you don't get into those
[mind] games too much."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Evans Is Looking for Relievers</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers have widened their search for relief help, adding
Cleveland right-hander Paul Shuey, Florida right-hander Braden Looper
and Milwaukee right-hander Luis Vizcaino to the list of pitchers they
are targeting in trade talks.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodger bullpen has given up 11 earned runs in 11 2/3 innings
of the last four games, heightening the need for another quality arm
to give closer Eric Gagne and set-up man Paul Quantrill help in the
latter innings of close games.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dan Evans has been discussing possible deals for
Toronto right-hander Kelvim Escobar, Pittsburgh left-hander Scott
Sauerbeck, Cleveland left-hander Ricardo Rincon and Tampa Bay
right-hander Esteban Yan, but several quality relievers became
available in the last two days, causing Evans to shift gears a bit.</LD>
<TE>   Shuey, 31, probably has the best stuff of the bunch, a 95-mph
fastball, a nasty split-fingered fastball and an excellent curve. He
is 3-0 with a 2.41 earned-run average in 39 games, but he's notorious
for following two or three great outings with a bad one.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey is in the second year of a four-year, $11.2-million contract
and has a no-trade clause for this season, but he's not happy about
the direction the salary-dumping Indians are going and would probably
welcome a trade.</TE>
<TE>   Vizcaino, 25, is 5-1 with a 2.78 ERA and two saves in 51 games and
has limited right-handed hitters to a .179 average. Looper, 28, is
0-3 with a 3.54 ERA in 48 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers traded reserve outfielder Hiram Bocachica to the
Detroit Tigers on Thursday for minor league pitcher Tom Farmer and a
player to be named, a move designed to clear a spot on the 25-man
roster for Tyler Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers planned to designate Bocachica for assignment to make
room for Houston, the utility player who was acquired Tuesday from
the Milwaukee Brewers and will join the team today.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of possibly losing Bocachica to a waiver claim and
getting nothing in return, Evans was able to work a deal with the
Tigers, who like Bocachica's speed, power potential and versatility.</TE>
<TE>   Bocachica, 26, hit .215 with four homers and nine runs batted in,
and his playing time--65 at-bats in 49 games--was scarce, which made
him expendable. Farmer, 22, was 6-8 with a 4.92 ERA in 16 starts for
double-A Erie (Pa.). The right-hander was recently promoted to
triple-A Toledo, where he made one start.</TE>

<HD>Valenzuela Recalls Top Memories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Although Pat Valenzuela won Del Mar's first $1-million race, the 1991
Pacific Classic with Best Pal, and he has won 47 other stakes races
at the track that Bing Crosby built, two of the most memorable
moments here for the 39-year-old jockey came during morning workouts.</LD>
<LD>   He dipped into his memory book Thursday, during a training-hours
break at the seaside course. He won his 48th Del Mar stake on opening
day Wednesday, with True Phenomenon in a division of the Oceanside,
but it was his first win here in five years, due to repeated
suspensions brought on by drug use.</LD>
<LD>   In the good old days, Valenzuela could ride the hair off horses,
no matter who else showed up in the jockeys' room. From 1986 to 1991,
he won three Del Mar riding titles, and he might be on the threshold
of recapturing some of that luster. At the recently concluded
Hollywood Park stand--only the second full meet for Valenzuela in
almost two years--he won 74 races as he outdistanced Alex Solis, who
was No. 2 in the standings, by 13 wins.</LD>
<TE>   Eleven years ago this August, Valenzuela was aboard Best Pal for
an important morning workout a few days before the Pacific Classic.
Gary Jones, the horse's trainer, was looking for a sharp move to
prepare the 3-year-old gelding for a race against a bevy of older
contenders that included Farma Way, Itsallgreektome and Unbridled,
the 1990 Kentucky Derby winner.</TE>
<TE>   One furlong into a six-furlong workout, as Best Pal gathered
momentum down the backstretch, one of Valenzuela's stirrups broke.</TE>
<TE>   "That could have been disastrous," he said. "I don't know how I
kept him together and stayed on. But he finished up in something like
1:10 4/5. That was probably one of the best works he ever had, but it
wasn't easy."</TE>
<TE>   Best Pal gave Valenzuela one of nine wins in million-dollar races.
Six of those seven-figure wins have come in the Breeders' Cup. Only
seven jockeys have won more, even though Valenzuela has had only one
Breeders' Cup mount since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   A Breeders' Cup win that got away was Sunday Silence's decision
over archenemy Easy Goer in the $3-million Classic at Gulfstream Park
in 1989. In a 14-race career--nine wins, five seconds and $4.9
million in purses--Sunday Silence was ridden 12 times by Valenzuela,
including their win together in the 1989 Kentucky Derby, but several
weeks before the Classic, Valenzuela tested positive for cocaine at
Santa Anita, and Chris McCarron took over.</TE>
<TE>   As a prep for Gulfstream, trainer Charlie Whittingham scheduled
the $1-million Super Derby at Louisville Downs. The colt was still
stabled at Del Mar, and before Whittingham put him on a plane he
needed to work Sunday Silence a crisp mile.</TE>
<TE>   "Let him roll," Whittingham said to Valenzuela as he climbed
aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Roll? Clockers would have been better served to report the workout
in machs instead of minutes and seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "He did it in 1:33 1/5," Valenzuela said. "That equaled
[Precisionist's] track record."</TE>
<TE>   Was Whittingham miffed that Valenzuela might have overdone it?</TE>
<TE>   "No," the jockey said. "Charlie was happy."</TE>
<TE>   Happier still when Sunday Silence cantered in the Super Derby,
winning by six lengths. His time for the opening mile of the 1
1/4-mile race was a sedentary 1:37 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela was surprised to hear that Sunday Silence, the premier
sire in Japan for the last seven years, has fallen on tough times.
Now 16, the stallion has undergone three surgeries, the most recent
on July 18, after a virus led to severe swelling in his right
foreleg.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be all right," Valenzuela said. "He's a fighter."</TE>
<TE>   The nine-lives jockey could have been talking about himself. The
California Horse Racing Board, probably on the brink of throwing away
the key, allowed Valenzuela to return, from another of his enforced
layoffs, at Santa Anita this winter.</TE>
<TE>   His weight had soared to 145 pounds--at the memorial service for
jockey Chris Antley, Valenzuela's double-breasted suit was swelled to
contain him--but, given one more reprieve, he exercised and dieted
diligently.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the regimen was running from his Arcadia home to the
jockeys' room at Santa Anita--exactly 4.9 miles. By opening day, he
was down to 113 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't win any races right off, but with his first mount he
finished a strong second on a horse owned by Ron Waranch, one of his
staunch supporters, and several Santa Anita trainers snapped to
attention. When the meet ended in April, Valenzuela had won 42 races
and was sixth in the standings. At all tracks this year, the horses
he has ridden have earned $5.5 million to rank him 10th nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been [sober] for a year, a year as of last month,"
Valenzuela said. "They test me [for drugs] at least eight times a
month, sometimes more. If there's any resentment [about getting
another chance], I don't hear it. I don't hear any bad vibes. There
are probably still some trainers who won't use me, but I think over a
period of time, they've seen that I've had my old commitment again."</TE>
<TE>   Said trainer Patrick Biancone: "He's paid his dues. You can see
the fire in his eyes again."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela's richest win this year was for trainer Julio Canani,
astride Ladies Din in the Shoemaker Mile at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday in suburban Chicago, trainer Bobby Frankel has given
Valenzuela the mount on Kappa King in the $225,000 Arlington, a prep
for the Arlington Million next month.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela will also ride in two other stakes on the Arlington
Park card.</TE>
<TE>   In the good old days, that's the kind of company he would
automatically keep.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela finished second on Sumati as Arbiter, ridden by Mike
Smith, won the Kobuk King Stakes, running 1 3/8 miles on grass in a
course-record 2:12 1/5. The old record, 2:12 2/5, was set by Navarone
in 1992. Arbiter was trainer Craig Lewis' third win for the first two
days of the meet.... Laffit Pincay's two wins give him five for the
meet and 9,394 for his career.... Trainer Bill Spawr has already won
four races.... Kona Gold, undefeated in five starts at Del Mar, faces
10 rivals Saturday as he tries to win the Bing Crosby Handicap for
the third straight year.... Nine horses, including last year's winner
Janet, are entered in Saturday's $400,000 John Mabee Ramona
Handicap.... Wednesday's record opening-day crowd was officially
updated by the track to 37,439, an increase of 155.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If the first two days of the meet are any indication, Craig Lewis and
Bill Spawr are trainers to watch this summer at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis and Spawr have combined to win seven of the first 17 races.
Lewis, who has three victories, will have two starters and Spawr, who
had two wins on Wednesday and Thursday, has three on today's card,
the first of seven twilight programs. Post time today and for the
next three Fridays is 4 p.m., then, for the final three weeks of the
meet, the Friday post is 3:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Spawr will be represented by Heightenedawarenes in the first, Aim
For The Moon in the third, the first leg of a pick six that has a
carryover of $93,851, and Mandan in the eighth. Lewis, meanwhile,
will send out a pair of comebackers--Comstock King in the first and
Sabre Tooth Tiger in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   A 6-year-old gelding, Heightenedawarenes has seen better days and
was a vet scratch before the start of the fifth race on July 6 at
Hollywood Park, but the California-bred has been 1-2 in six of seven
starts at Del Mar, so he could wake up with the change in scenery.</TE>
<TE>   Aim For The Moon is making her first start in a claimer and could
be the one to catch in the first leg of the pick six. Mandan is an
0-for-23 maiden who could share in the exotics in the finale.</TE>
<TE>   Comstock King has won two of three at Del Mar, but the trouble is
those two wins came nearly two years ago. Lewis won with the
returning Swordfish on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   An 0-for-9 maiden, Sabre Tooth Tiger will be running for the first
time since Sept. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Multiple stakes winners Forbidden Apple and Del
Mar Show head a solid field in the $150,000 Bernard Baruch Handicap
at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   The Baruch is a Grade II at 1 1/8 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Laffit Pincay Jr. He began the meet with three winners,
including his first Oceanside Stakes victory since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   He'll try for his first win in the $125,000 California
Thoroughbred Breeders Assn. Stakes since 1992 when he rides Magic
Smoke tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jason Lumpkins. Shockingly, the jockey didn't win a
single race at Solano, losing with all 14 of his mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exacta boxes keying Green Eyed Lady with Yet
Anothernatalie, Imveryprivate and Sweet Olympio.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/3. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.80/$16.80. Total money bet: $34.</TE>

<HD>Owners' Lawyer Optimistic</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Manfred, encouraged by negotiations, says labor
agreement can be reached without a strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for baseball's owners and players continued to describe their
collective bargaining negotiations in positive tones Thursday in New
York while acknowledging that significant differences remain.</LD>
<LD>   After another lengthy session dealing with revenue sharing,
management's lead lawyer, Rob Manfred, said he was encouraged with
the process and added that he remains convinced an "agreement can be
reached without an interruption of the season."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it takes both sides to reach an agreement, and while
union lawyer Steve Fehr said it was an "optimistic sign" that "we
continue to discuss ways to bridge the gap" on revenue sharing,
colleague Gene Orza said it would be a mistake to dismiss the
substantive problems that remain.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't mean to sound pessimistic," Orza said. "I just don't
think bells and whistles are in order yet."</TE>
<TE>   Neither side would discuss specifics of Thursday's talks, but Fehr
reiterated that "methodology" remains as critical an issue in revenue
sharing as the "magnitude" of the amount to be shared. The union
favors a split pool method of distribution that it believes would
send more money to the lowest-revenue clubs while management favors a
straight pool in which the amount to be shared would be divided
equally among all the clubs and would take more from the
highest-revenue clubs that drive the salary market.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no significant discussion on the owners' proposed
luxury tax on high payrolls, another potential obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations will continue today and are scheduled for every day
next week, the longest series of meetings.</TE>

<LD>Two-thirds of the participants in tonight's Vessels Maturity Trials
will be back for the finals in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 fastest qualifiers among the 15 entrants in the two trials
will return for the 400-yard Maturity on Aug. 10 and it will be one
of the biggest surprises if A Ransom isn't among the finalists.</LD>
<LD>   The former world champion will be favored in the second trial
while making his second start of 2002 for owners John or Kathie
Bobenrieth and trainer Connie Hall.</LD>
<TE>   In his first race as a 6-year-old, the California-bred gelding won
the Spencer Childers Handicap, beating Whosleavingwho, who is among
seven entered in the first trial, by half a length. It was the 18th
win in 29 starts for A Ransom and he has now earned more than
$912,000.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. A Secret Fly. 2. Shescape. 3. Lucks Flying High. 4.
Be Nice. 5. Ride On Time. 6. Mystical King. 7. Reeking Havoc. 8.
Whosleavingwho. 9. A Ransom. 10. Bdr Bug On The Dash.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Ourenay, Really Western and Reeking Havoc in the
seventh, Whosleavingwho and Habitual in the eighth, single A Ransom

<HD>Sampras Turns to an Old Friend: Annacone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The coaching cycle of Pete Sampras has come full circle.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras, who will turn 31 in August, has been searching for
answers during a disappointing 2002 and his latest attempted solution
is a return to stability. Paul Annacone, the USTA's managing director
for the USA Tennis High-Performance program, will resume coaching
Sampras at least through the U.S. Open in September.</LD>
<LD>   Annacone on Thursday confirmed speculation about their renewed
partnership. He had worked with Sampras from January 1995 through
December 2001. Since then, Sampras has worked with and parted ways
with Tom Gullikson and Jose Higueras.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been a lot of instability for someone who is a creature of
habit," Annacone said of Sampras, who is coming off an early loss at
Wimbledon and has not won a title since July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Annacone said Sampras needed a comfort zone and maintained it
won't take long to find that level.</TE>
<TE>   "As good as he is, it doesn't take a lot," Annacone said. "He can
jump over hurdles quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The move came with the support and assistance of USTA officials.
Rick Ferman, the USTA's executive director, said that one of its
goals is to foster relationships and cooperation between the
generations of American players. "We want to lend any support we can
to Pete ... and I'm hoping it branches out to the other great
players."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to go back to Annacone sounded simple. It would have
taken at least six months for Sampras to become accustomed to another
new voice and coaching style. For Annacone, it will mean more work
but not much in the way of scheduling changes. One unplanned addition
is next week's Masters Series event in Toronto, which will be
Sampras' first tournament since he lost in the second round of
Wimbledon to lucky loser George Bastl.</TE>
<TE>   The parting with Higueras was said to be amicable. Sampras came to
the realization that he needed a full-time coach and Higueras'
schedule was already busy enough because of his USTA coaching duties.
Higueras said last week he would have been prepared to continue
working with Sampras, and that he would not leave a struggling
player.</TE>
<TE>   Annacone, who has been at the men's tournament at UCLA, said he is
encouraged by his observations and discussions with Sampras. "I've
watched him work out," he said. "I don't think all of a sudden you
can't play."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roddick, a Davis Cup teammate of Sampras, played an
exhibition against him last week in Dallas for the Gullikson
Foundation, raising nearly $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch out for Pete at the Open," Roddick said. "We actually had a
very good conversation. He basically just said, 'This year has been
bad for me. But I'm looking forward to the new challenges, for the
first time in my career I have to come back.' "</TE>

<HD>MLS Commissioner Wants Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber Thursday lashed out at
racist remarks allegedly made during a post-game altercation between
players from the A-League's Rochester Rhinos and the Kansas City
Wizards of MLS.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas City midfielder Diego Gutierrez suffered a broken cheekbone
in the altercation and, according to Wizards' and U.S. national team
goalkeeper Tony Meola, was the target of a racial epithet by
Rochester forward Kirk Wilson, who has denied the allegation.</LD>
<LD>   Garber said it is the league's position that there be "zero
tolerance" for such behavior and asked that U.S. Soccer investigate
the incident, which occurred after a July 17 U.S. Open Cup
third-round match in Webster, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   "Without in any way pre-judging the results of this investigation,
it is important that we at MLS utilize all of the resources within
our power to eradicate racism and bias within our sport, at all
levels," Garber said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   "It is absolutely imperative that we maintain a zero tolerance
policy regarding this issue."</TE>
<TE>   In the match, Kansas City came from two goals down to defeat the
Rhinos, 3-2, in overtime and advance to the Open Cup quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, 24, last week told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle
that he had not used a racial slur against Gutierrez, which Meola
claimed had sparked the brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Economides, the Rhinos' general manager, told the newspaper
that Rochester stands behind its player.</TE>
<TE>   "Kirk has no history of anything like that and you have to
consider the source," Economides said. "I think Kirk has more
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Meola comes in here with his big-league mentality and says that?
That stuff doesn't fly here. He's arrogant and overrated."</TE>
<TE>   Sao Caetano Nears Title</TE>
<TE>   Sao Caetano, a Brazilian club founded only 13 years ago and which
until three years ago was playing second-division soccer, is one game
away from winning the South American championship.</TE>
<TE>   The unheralded club, nicknamed "Azulao" ("Big Blue") defeated
Olimpia of Paraguay, 1-0, Wednesday night in front of 45,000 in
Asuncion, Paraguay, in the first match of the two-game Copa
Libertadores final.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Ailton scored the game's lone goal in the 61st minute.</TE>
<TE>   The teams will play again in Sao Paolo, Brazil, on Wednesday. Sao
Caetano, coached by Jair Pecerni, needs only a tie to win the Copa
Libertadores in only its second appearance in the 42-year-old
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's Forrest Retires</TE>
<TE>   Canadian national team goalkeeper Craig Forrest announced his
retirement on the advice of doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest, 34, who has played for West Ham United in England for the
last six seasons, successfully overcame testicular cancer but said
the battle had taken a lot out of him and that doctors had told him
he "will be unable to maintain the necessary level of fitness to
compete at the game's highest level."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest said on the West Ham Web site that he is considering a
media role next after working for Canadian television during the 2002
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Luizao to Hertha Berlin</TE>
<TE>   Brazil striker Luizao, who played in two World Cup games as a
replacement for Ronaldo, signed a four-year contract with Hertha
Berlin of the German Bundesliga.</TE>
<TE>   Luizao, 26, has scored five goals in 11 games for Brazil and had
been pursued by the German team for several months after becoming a
free agent when his contract with the Brazilian club Gremio ended.</TE>
<TE>   Geremi Leaves Real Madrid</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon's Olympic gold medal-winning midfielder Geremi, 23, has
joined Middlesbrough of the English Premier League on a one-year loan
from European champion Real Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   1934 World Cup Keeper Dies</TE>
<TE>   One of the most accomplished and popular figures in Egyptian
soccer history, goalkeeper Mostafa Kamel Mansour, has died in Cairo
at age 87.</TE>
<TE>   Mansour was the oldest surviving African player to compete in the
1934 World Cup in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   On the club level, he played for al-Ahli in Egypt and for Queens
Park in Scotland and later became coach of Egypt's national team and,
later still, an international referee.</TE>
<TE>   Chivas Veteran Jasso Dies</TE>
<TE>   Juan Jasso, one of the legendary players in the history of the
Mexican club Chivas of Guadalajara, has died of stomach cancer at 76,
his family announced.</TE>
<TE>   Jasso made his debut for Chivas in 1945 at age 19 and played for
21 seasons, finally retiring in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Mexican league championship seven times with Chivas, in
1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964 and 1965.</TE>
<TE>   African Hosts Chosen</TE>
<TE>   Burkina Faso will stage the 2003 African Youth Championship from
Jan. 4-18 and Swaziland will play host to the 2003 African Under-17
Championship on yet-to-be-determined dates in May, the Confederation
of African Football (CAF) announced.</TE>
<TE>   The two competitions will provide Africa's entrants for the FIFA
World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates March 25-April
16 and the FIFA Under-17 World Championship in Finland in August
2003.</TE>

<HD>It's One Move They Can Do Without</HD>
<DH>Tennis: UCLA student association could lose up to $30,000
if the Mercedes-Benz Cup goes to Carson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cars keep stacking up like they do at the impound. But this isn't
the impound, it's parking garage 4 at UCLA and at least 50 cars are
looking for a spot.</LD>
<LD>   They are all mostly here for the Mercedes-Benz Cup.</LD>
<LD>   They honk, yell and pray they'll find a spot before Gustavo
Kuerten's first serve at 3:48 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the problem with having a tennis tournament at UCLA.
There's not enough parking," said Laura Alonso, 42, stuck with four
teenage daughters inside a Ford sports utility vehicle with two
Brazilian flags clipped to a window.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to keep moving. We came to see Gustavo play and not to
sit in traffic behind 20 cars."</TE>
<TE>   That will be a problem. It's five minutes before the fifth-seeded
player from Brazil hits Straus Stadium's hard court.</TE>
<TE>   One of the complaints from fans attending the 76th annual
tournament is the parking. Or the lack of.</TE>
<TE>   The talk about the tournament relocating to a place with better
facilities circulated throughout UCLA on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans, such as the Alonsos, would welcome the change of venue.
The Alonsos said Carson looks like a perfect fit. Phil Anschutz is
building a state-of-the-art tennis stadium there that will open next
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Others want it to stay at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "This place has the best ambience for tennis," said Marty
Goldstone, 75, eating popcorn and looking toward groups of
enthusiastic fans talking tennis and swinging rackets.</TE>
<TE>   "I live in Beverly Hills and I hope the tournament remains here.
It's convenient for me because it's only a 15-minute drive."</TE>
<TE>   Goldstone, who has been to the tournament a dozen times, also said
he'd support the tournament wherever it goes because he loves tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of tradition here," said Goldstone of the
tournament, which signed a 99-year contract with UCLA before the 1984
Olympic Games. "I'd hate to see it go because there isn't a bad seat
on Straus Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't go to as many tournaments if they decide to move to
Carson."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has 80 years left on the agreement, but its facilities won't
compare to Carson's.</TE>
<TE>   Players such as Kuerten and Pete Sampras have complained about the
small locker rooms in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA Tennis Center has a capacity of 7,200. The Carson center
will be expandable to 13,000 seats.</TE>
<TE>   If the Mercedes-Benz Cup moves, which tournament director Bob
Kramer said Wednesday is not likely, there will be a huge economic
hit at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   At least 100 students work during the seven-day tournament as part
of the Associated Students UCLA Restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   They depend on the income made during the summer, working at the
four concession stands and two buffet-style restaurants, the
Champions Club and Clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Williams, the director of food operations, said the
Associated Students UCLA Restaurants could lose up to $30,000 if the
tournament leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the majority of money generated comes from the
Champions Club, which serves 300-350 plates per day at $28 for adults
and $21 for children under 12.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to survive here in Westwood if you don't work during
the summer," said Jacqueline Vu, 20, a sociology major and waiter at
the Champions Club. "I need this money because I share a
$2,100-per-month apartment with two other students.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything helps and [waiters] sometimes can get $50 tips. We just
want people to keep coming."</TE>

<HD>Be Careful About Calling In the Cavalry in the Struggle for
Homeland Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN DYCUS</AU>
<BD>Stephen Dycus, a professor at Vermont Law School, is
lead author of "National Security Law" (Aspen Law &amp; Business, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, President Bush called for reexamination of the 1878 law
that limits the role of the military in law enforcement activities.
This call was echoed over the weekend by Homeland Security Director
Tom Ridge and Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, head of a new military command
that would direct the Pentagon's response to another terrorist attack
at home.</LD>
<LD>   Congressional authority for such a response is already extremely
broad, and expansion of that authority would challenge a revered
American tradition of keeping the military out of domestic affairs
except in the most extraordinary circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   Efforts to further weaken the law--known as the Posse Comitatus
Act--are ill-advised and unnecessary.</LD>
<TE>   The Defense Department will undoubtedly play a key role in helping
the nation avoid or recover from a terrorist attack. No other
government entity has its equipment, training and experience in the
use of force. None has such a durable communications system. No other
agency, if we include the National Guard, is so widely dispersed
across the country in places where its services may be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing this potential, Congress has passed several laws
relaxing the strictures of the Posse Comitatus Act.</TE>
<TE>   One law gives the president authority in an emergency to use the
armed forces to perform work "essential for the preservation of life
and property."</TE>
<TE>   Another allows military personnel to assist the Justice Department
in collecting intelligence or conducting searches and seizures if
"necessary for the immediate protection of human life."</TE>
<TE>   Still another provides wide-ranging authority to use DOD resources
and personnel to respond to an actual or threatened terrorist attack
involving a weapon of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Also relevant here are statutes dating back to 1792, when Congress
first authorized the president to use the armed forces to put down
insurrections.</TE>
<TE>   Military involvement in domestic affairs always has been viewed
with great antipathy, and for good reason. Military leaders have long
worried that such involvement would erode their readiness to defend
the nation abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians worry that while members of the armed forces
take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, they are not
trained, like the police, to uphold Americans' rights to privacy and
due process.</TE>
<TE>   These fears have been heightened since Sept. 11 by the indefinite
detention of citizens and immigrants and by proposals to try them
before secret military tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   The Declaration of Independence counts among its reasons for
severing ties with Britain that the king had "kept among us, in times
of peace, standing armies without consent of our legislature ... [and
had] affected to render the military independent of and superior to
the civil power."</TE>
<TE>   Creation of a standing army at home may seem farfetched today. But
two years ago a national commission on terrorism warned that the
president should "always designate a federal civilian agency other
than the Department of Defense" as lead federal agency in responding
to a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The commission worried that Americans would not "draw the
technical distinction between the Department of Defense--the civilian
entity--and the U.S. armed forces--the military entity."</TE>
<TE>   Unstated, yet palpable, was a fear that the military could, on its

the Defense Department ample authority to protect the American
homeland while performing in that subordinate role.</TE>

<HD>Betcha Can't Sue Just One</HD>

<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leave it to lawyers to combine the two favorite American pastimes:
eating and suing. In various states, lawsuits have been filed or are
being planned against the fast-food industry. Lawyers who recently
received windfalls in fees from tobacco lawsuits are now eyeing fast
food as the next opportunity for super-size awards.</LD>
<LD>   With the exception of tobacco, there are few things that kill more
people than overeating. Obesity caused more than 300,000 deaths in
2000. That same year, obesity resulted in $117 billion in health-care
costs.</LD>
<LD>   In the last 10 years, obesity rates in the United States have
increased 60%, and states like Iowa have populations with more than
20% obesity. Those figures are enough to make the most restrained
personal injury lawyer salivate like Pavlov's dog.</LD>
<TE>   Lawyers tend to hunt in packs, and the fast-food industry has
begun to look like that slow, stumbling member of the herd--ripe for
culling. Lawyers are now probing the fast-food industry in at least
six different areas for potential liability.</TE>
<TE>   Some theories have proved fast and easy kills. Various Hindus,
Sikhs, Jews and vegetarians recently sued McDonald's over its use of
animal fats in its French fries. This resulted in a relatively easy
legal settlement for $12 million, including $2.5 million in legal
fees, without a trial. Additional lawsuits are now being planned.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, however, are looking for much bigger returns in linking
fast food to widespread deaths and injuries in the same fashion as
tobacco. This effort was given a boost recently by studies linking
French fries and other potato products to cancer. It appears that a
large serving of McDonald's fries includes 72 micrograms of
acrylamide, a probable cancer-causing compound that the Environmental
Protection Agency limits to 0.12 micrograms in an eight-ounce glass
of water.  While these studies are in their early stages, they put
fast-food companies on notice and, if confirmed later, could result
in liability.</TE>
<TE>   Other possible theories may target advertising campaigns,
particularly those directed to families. As a father of three boys
under 4, I can attest to the almost hypnotic effect of the Happy
Meal. There is hardly a need for a surgeon general's warning. I
realize I am buying concentrated fat and acrylamides in a box, but
they come with toys.</TE>
<TE>   I am left with a choice of long-term cancer and obesity risks on
the one hand and, on the other, the immediate benefit of strapping
three children into restraints and rendering them semiconscious in a
fat- and toy-induced trance. On some Saturday afternoons, I would pry
McNuggets from the cold, dead fingers of Ronald McDonald, if
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   It is precisely the success of these campaigns that may attract
lawyers under either product-liability theories or consumer
protection statutes.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that these meals are not wholesome as advertised,
fast-food businesses are vulnerable to allegations of
misrepresentation, fraud and negligence.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers are not the only ones who could benefit from targeting the
fast-food industry. Politicians have already staked out their
possible share in "fighting the fat."</TE>
<TE>   Various states are considering adding "sin taxes" on junk food to
make their citizens better aware of their dangers. This idea would
also add billions in new taxes for legislatures that spent their way
back into debt in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators have long relied on the profits of "sin." Such taxes
on cigarettes make the federal and state governments the greatest
beneficiaries of smoking. The tobacco settlements resulted in huge
amounts of money going to the states, which led to a frenzy of
spending. With this money gone, a new taxable sin would be most
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers also will find an eager ally among nutritionists and
dieticians who view dining out a bit differently from the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas a plate of fettuccine Alfredo is generally seen as a
Northern Italian delight, experts have labeled it "a heart attack on
a plate." Whereas most of us view a Starbucks white chocolate mocha
as a refreshing afternoon pick-me-up, its 600-calorie load has been
described as "drinking a Big Mac."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there remain some significant hurdles to holding the
Cheesecake Factory liable for the fact that you ordered a slice of
its carrot cake with more than 1,500 calories and enough fat to
lubricate an infantry fighting vehicle. Our society is saturated by
fats, and it is hard to isolate a single source.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, obesity has various potential causes, and the connection
between repeated "Big Mac attacks" and one heart attack is difficult
to establish.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the question of personal responsibility, which
seems often ignored in these massive lawsuits. We may soon see
campaigns from the industry reminding us that "Twinkies don't kill
people, people kill people."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the idea of slimming down through litigation has a
curious appeal today. Increasingly, we look to litigation to address
our irresistible impulses and to correct our personal choices. Who
cares if some lawyers get fatter if we get skinnier.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, it is a relief. I have informed my wife that my
recent weight gain is nothing less than a long-term investment. As a
potential plaintiff, I could well be eating myself into prosperity;
carrying the kids' college fund around my midsection, safe from stock
market fluctuations. Who needs Jenny Craig when you can have Johnnie
Cochran?</TE>
<TE>   It may be the ultimate American diet plan brought to you by your
friends at the American Bar Assn.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Plan With Promise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a long road from a good plan to a Great Park, but the Navy and
the city of Irvine have made a bold, if question-provoking, start
toward transforming the former El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Not for nothing has Irvine developed a reputation for master
planning. The city/Navy land-use plan outlined this week for the
south Orange County base calls for 20% private development and 80%
public park. No one so far, though, is releasing figures for the cost
of cleaning up toxic wastes and developing a 4,000-acre municipal
park, which would be one of the nation's largest.</LD>
<LD>   The Great Park project started as a not-in-my-backyard bid by
south county residents to stop county officials' push for a major
international airport at El Toro. After years of seesaw battles and
county voters' rejection of a proposed airport at the site in March,
the federal government stepped in: Instead of handing the land over
for an airport, the Navy would sell it off for development. It looked
as if airport opponents' Great Park initiative had fallen into the
same rubble as the airport plan.</LD>
<TE>   Out of the ruins came an unlikely partnership of city and Navy and
a detailed plan for the former base. Under the plan, the site would
be auctioned off to the highest bidders; 3,400 homes and 2.9 million
square feet of retail space would be allowed on 738 developable
acres. As part of the deal, developers would purchase 4,000 acres
allotted for public use, which they would deed over for a park whose
development and upkeep they would fund. That's more than builders are
usually asked to do, but the land would sell for less than market
value. Since the purchase would come with development rights,
builders would save millions of dollars on the planning process.</TE>
<TE>   Had county supervisors been this willing to balance private
interests with the public's concerns by planning for a smaller, more
palatable airport--an option this editorial page supported--they
might have pulled it off.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has said it will take on the stringent environmental
cleanup needed for housing and a park. But at this point, no one is
being specific about the costs and whether money from the Navy and
development concessions will pay for them. If not, in the end will
there be only a So-So Park?</TE>
<TE>   The public needs specific answers to big questions. But thanks to
the Navy for effectively ending much of the wearisome debate over El
Toro. The county, which has not yet decided to let Irvine take over
the land, and the airport proponents, who still have their lawsuits
in place, should join as partners in this new effort or give up and
go home.</TE>

<HD>A Good Job for a New INS</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere, the fuse on the next terrorist strike against the United
States quietly sizzles. Agencies scramble to cut it before the
all-but-inevitable bang. And so the Justice Department this week
announced a plan to enforce a law requiring all noncitizens to
promptly report any change of residence to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. And so, predictably, some immigrant advocates
cried foul.</LD>
<LD>   In the months since 9/11, Americans have grappled with the
delicate balance between individual rights and the need for security.
Troubling questions continue to arise over complex matters such as
when, if ever, immigrant suspects can be legitimately detained
without due process. Whether foreigners should let their host country
know where they're living, however, hardly ranks as a tough call. But
even such a common-sense policy will lead to increased chaos until
the INS tackles a more imminent threat to the nation's safety: the
agency's own incompetence.</LD>
<LD>   The residence reporting law, which has been on the books largely
unnoticed for 50 years, will apply to all immigrants in the U.S. But
just processing the updates from the 10 million here legally--more
than 1 million just in Los Angeles--is a massive job. Today's INS
would almost certainly botch it, creating even more of a bureaucratic
nightmare for immigrants already plagued by the agency's sloppy
paperwork and erratic policies.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, the INS is undergoing a major makeover. With luck and
aggressive dogging by Congress, the new INS, in whatever form it
takes, will be sufficiently efficient to contend with the avalanche
of data--especially if the agency starts slowly, initially applying
the reporting requirement only to newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Even before addressing the logistics, though, someone needs to
write fairness into the law, with a guarantee that the immigrants who
fail to comply will almost invariably face no harsher a penalty than
a fine. Only in the rarest case--a terrorism suspect whom the
judicial system might otherwise set free--should the government be
allowed to use failure to report a residency change as an expedient
to deport someone. And then only with full due-process protections.</TE>
<TE>   With those adjustments, the residency reporting requirement will
prove a sensible way for the nation to begin getting a grip on the
immigration free-for-all that makes it so absurdly easy for a tiny
number of potential mass murderers to disappear amid the law-abiding
masses. It's the sort of reasoned, circumscribed adjustment that must
be made as people living in the U.S.--citizens and foreigners
alike--figure out how to maintain both freedom and security in the
age of terrorism.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The House of Representatives is losing one of its most colorful
figures, and not a moment too soon. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio)
was expelled from Congress this week after a U.S. District Court jury
in April convicted him of racketeering, bribery and corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant certainly added life to dry congressional proceedings.
His interjections, like "beam me up," coupled with pontifications on
everything from Spanish soccer stars to insidious Chinese communism,
compelled people to read the Congressional Record. But few outside
Ohio's Mahoning Valley took him seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant's expulsion was recommended by the House Ethics
Committee. Any substance that the Ohioan might have had was
overshadowed by his antics before that panel--like discussing his
bowel disorders and accusing a Colorado colleague of (gasp) being a
Coors drinker (presumably meaning he's a lightweight at
elbow-bending).</LD>
<TE>   The House rarely sentences its merely unethical members to what
Rep. Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio) described as the political death
penalty. Only one member has been expelled from the lower chamber
since the Civil War, though others have taken the hint and resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich got just a fine for some
carelessness about how his politics classes at two Georgia colleges
were funded and for lying to the Ethics Committee. In 1856, Rep.
Preston Brooks, a Southerner, suffered no censure after he beat a
Northern colleague, Charles Sumner, with a wooden cane until it
broke. Some fellow House members sent Brooks new canes.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's behavior during his hearings and the seriousness of
his multiple convictions left the Ethics Committee no choice. The
House vote to expel was 420 to 1, with the only "no" vote coming from
another beleaguered member, Rep. Gary A. Condit (R-Ceres).</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's famous one-minute speeches may have livened the
Congressional Record, but they also made him a joke, with little
power to serve his mainly blue-collar constituents. Among his
convictions was one for skimming the salaries of his staff members
and making them work on his farm and fix his boat.</TE>
<TE>   His latest sideshow distracted Congress from issues like
structuring the proposed Homeland Security Department. He'll be
missed, but not for the right reasons.</TE>

<LD>Re "Gaza Inflamed After Israeli Raid," July 24: If Salah Shehada, the
top Hamas official targeted in the raid, knew he was a target, why
did he choose to locate in the middle of a residential area,
surrounded by his family and other children as well? This is, sadly,
typical of the operation of the Palestinians in the territories, who
are known to hide munitions under schools and in homes, using their
own children as human shields.</LD>
<LD>   Of course the loss of life, especially the loss of children's
lives, is a horrible tragedy, no matter how or to whom it happens. A
lasting peace will be reached only if both sides come to the table
sincerely, without the rhetoric reported in your article of
guaranteeing that every Jewish home in Israel experiences a funeral.</LD>

fruitless gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Palestinian Authority and Israel have received economic

<LD>Re "Fair Deals for Mentally Ill," editorial, July 21: The problem
with giving money to the mental health sector is that it is like
buying junk bonds. At best it is a risky and poor investment. Even
when state hospitals were given government carte blanche in the '60s,
there was no guarantee that anybody committed, willingly or
involuntarily, would emerge "cured." In fact, the overwhelming
majority who somehow made it through the "cuckoo's nest" gantlet were
not unlike concentration camp survivors, so beaten down by
psychiatric abuses that they were far worse off than before they were
committed.</LD>
<LD>   I would prefer to see hard evidence of sweeping reform in the
mental health community before I would agree with contributing even
one penny through my tax dollars or insurance premiums. Reform would
consist of many things. I'd like to see hard evidence of patients
being treated with dignity and respect and the use of harmful
psychiatric drugs and electric shock eliminated.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial is right on target in decrying the tragically
underfunded programs that leave thousands of Californians to wander
our streets, each lost in a terrible, private abyss of serious mental
illness. But this is not the case for more than 100 adolescents at
Metropolitan State Hospital. They had no other haven after repeatedly
striking out in foster care and group homes. Now they're receiving
quality care and treatment by skilled, state-licensed staff.</TE>
<TE>   It's unfortunate that you tied your otherwise insightful comments
to unfounded allegations that Metropolitan's employees have been
improperly restraining or medicating patients. Restraints are used
not for the convenience of staff but when psychotic, combative
patients attack others. This is no different than when any
nonhospitalized person becomes violent. And today's medications have
done wonders in helping people who otherwise would remain devastated
by their illnesses.</TE>

<LD>So cutting a few branches off an oak tree in Calabasas will get you a
$10,000 fine, with a possible $40,000 if the tree doesn't survive
("Tree Boards Cut No Slack," July 22). Where's the logic here?
Wouldn't a couple hundred dollars and a stern warning have been fair
and decent to this couple who recently moved in from Michigan?</LD>
<LD>   Kay Greeley, the city's arborist, says, "It's nothing personal.
It's all about the oaks." Really? Nothing personal? Trees before
people? Ruin an oak tree and we will ruin you? Shame, shame, shame.</LD>

<TE>   Judging from the accompanying photograph, it appears that Carolyn
Scharg's house is situated mere feet from the base of the offending
oak. Had the developers, planners and tree board members at the time
of construction had the foresight to anticipate such real-life
factors as tree growth, then the problem of encroaching tree limbs,
and their trimming by homeowners, would have been eliminated.</TE>

<TE>   I also live in Calabasas and have for more than 30 years. I am
extremely environmentally conscious, never litter, and I recycle
every material possible. I believe it is the duty of every citizen to
protect the resources we have.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't everyday life hard enough, with enough rules and
regulations, without the city of Calabasas coming down so hard on
someone who just moved to the community from out of state? In this
season of extreme fire hazards we are hearing much more about keeping
excess brush away from our houses than about the obscure and
relatively unknown law that prohibits homeowners from cutting any
part of an oak tree without a permit. This woman and her husband were
probably just trying to protect their very expensive
investment--their new home. Perhaps Calabasas could find more
dangerous lawbreakers to prosecute.</TE>

<LD>Re "Preventable Hospital Infections Becoming a Deadly Epidemic," July
21: Infection rates in hospitals have long been a serious concern for
patients. If restaurants receive ratings from A to D for cleanliness,
then certainly hospitals should be evaluated in a very public way for
their infection control and cleanliness. This is an extremely
important area of medical concern. Patients--which most of us will
become at some point in our lives--must realize that no matter how
well trained their doctors may be, their lives may depend on adequate
hand-washing and housekeeping tasks and a high level of infection
control practiced by everyone working in the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   We as a society must determine where our public funds are to be
spent for health and safety and make demands on those in charge of
tax-dollar spending. Obviously, cost-cutting should not start at the
level of infection control, and the public should be notified as to
the infection rate and cleanliness rating a hospital receives before
entering as a patient.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Vote Against Drilling Off Coast," July 18: Because of the
leadership of Reps. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) and George Miller
(D-Martinez), the House of Representatives has voted to cut off funds
for oil drilling off California's coast. Perhaps this strong
bipartisan vote will finally goad President Bush into doing right by
California by buying back the existing federal leases as he did for
his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   But don't hold your breath. Without a brother who is running for
reelection in the state, the president is likely to do what he
normally does in these situations: choose the side of his wealthy
contributors in corporate America at the expense of our environment.</LD>

<LD>Reading Robert Scheer's July 23 commentary, "The Boom or Bush Cycle,"
one would believe that all corporate malfeasance started at noon Jan.
20, 2001--that before President Bush's inauguration everyone in the
corporate world was a good citizen and kept the books clean. Scheer
states, "The Bushes' contempt for government regulation of capitalism
has allowed corporate piracy to drive the nation toward financial
ruin."</LD>
<LD>   Though Bush has done nothing for the economy, most of the
corporate piracy and the resulting economic downturn started while
Scheer's hero, Bill Clinton, was in office. Yet throughout his rant,
Clinton is never mentioned. In the future I suggest that The Times
should put a disclaimer on all of Scheer's commentaries as "being out
of touch with reality."</LD>

<TE>   Scheer is right on. Every time another big business (like
WorldCom) collapses, we get a new terrorist scare. What will it be
this time? Bush should put his money where his mouth is and crack
down on these big-time crooks.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing he should do is fire Harvey Pitt, the head of the
SEC, and get someone who's not hand in glove with the big boys. We
need a man for the people who will do more than just administer a
slap on the wrist. And follow that up with removing Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill. Let's see some real concern and compassion
for the little guys, Dubya.</TE>

<HD>Davis Wants Faster and Wider Abduction Alerts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of what would have been Samantha Runnion's sixth birthday,
Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday introduced a plan aimed at informing the
public more quickly about child abductions by flashing the news to
motorists on 1,000 freeway message signs.</LD>
<LD>   Davis also said sheriffs and police chiefs in all 58 counties
would be urged to train their departments to use alert systems that
send information within minutes to law enforcement agencies and to
radio and television stations.</LD>
<LD>   "In child abductions, time is of the essence," Davis said during a
conference call Thursday. "The most powerful weapon we have is public
information that's delivered fast and factually."</LD>
<TE>   But the political fallout from Samantha's murder divided Davis and
his Republican opponent in the governor's race. Bill Simon Jr. said
the so-called Amber alert system touted by Davis should have been
adopted long ago, and he blamed Davis for not moving more swiftly to
implement it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite possible that the Amber alert could have prevented
this," Simon said, standing on the front lawn of a Stockton home,
where he spent the morning chatting with residents about their
Neighborhood Watch program. Davis' chief political strategist, Garry
South, dismissed those remarks as an attempt to "make some cheap
political points off of a terrible tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   The new plan, called the California Child Safety Amber Network, is
voluntary for now. But Davis said he hopes to sign a bill by the end
of the summer that would require law enforcement agencies to use the
alert systems.</TE>
<TE>   The network is similar to those in at least a dozen other states,
many of which are modeled after the one developed in Texas in 1996
after 9-year-old Amber Hagerman was kidnapped while riding her bike
and killed. Orange County is one of a few California jurisdictions
with a similar program.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona and others noted that
child-abduction alerts are rare. Carona has used a local alert system
called the Child Abduction Regional Emergency Alert only twice.</TE>
<TE>   He credited CARE, as the system is known, for the quick arrest of
the suspect in Samantha's kidnapping and slaying. Within 15 minutes
of her abduction July 15, a regional alert was put out to both law
enforcement and news media. He said the case shows the need to make
the system statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been through a traumatic situation with Samantha," he said.
"We do realize, having been through it, we should do some things
differently. We want to enhance the program. The CARE alert program
can be better."</TE>
<TE>   Victim rights groups have been urging Davis for a year to order
the Office of Emergency Services to implement an Amber system.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate that it took this for it to happen," said Jenni
Thompson, communication director for the Polly Klaas Foundation. "It
shouldn't have. The point is to not let it happen to another child."</TE>
<TE>   The Texas alert system is generally regarded as a success. But in
1999, because alerts were considered too frequent, the system was
made more selective. Now, alerts are issued only if the missing child
is younger than 15 and appears to be in grave danger.</TE>
<TE>   In California, there were 310 abductions by strangers from 1996 to
2001, according to the state Department of Justice.</TE>

<HD>Blake's Daughter Wins Guardianship</HD>
<DH>Courts: She will care for the 2-year-old child the actor
had with woman he's accused of killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake's older daughter was granted permanent guardianship
Thursday of the actor's 2-year-old child with the woman he is accused
of killing.</LD>
<LD>   Delinah Blake, 35, has cared for the child, Rose Lenore Sophia
Blake, since their father was arrested April 18 in the fatal shooting
of his 44-year-old wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, near a Studio City
restaurant in May 2001.</LD>
<LD>   In his ruling, Los Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner H.
Ronald Hauptman denied a request by the child's maternal aunt,
Margerry Bakley, to delay a decision until she hired a family-law
attorney to represent her interests.</LD>
<TE>   Bakley said she wants the court to grant her visitation rights,
but the judge said she did not have any standing as the child's aunt.
Bakley said she last saw her niece in April during a supervised visit
at the home of one of Blake's lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   In her petition for guardianship, Delinah Blake said she had
helped her father care for Rose since about September 2000, when the
child was 3 months old. She also wrote that she was qualified to
raise Rose, both as her half-sister and as a clinical psychologist
who works with abused and neglected children.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 68, is being held without bail at Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts
of soliciting murder and conspiracy. He faces life in prison without
parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Bakley, surrounded by her manager, an
attorney and a bodyguard, said she wants Rose to grow up knowing her
mother's side of the family.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Eric J. Dubin, said Bakley just "wants to give the
little girl a hug" and be able to tell Rose "I love you."</TE>
<TE>   Bakley also expressed concern about the child's future. "If, in
fact, Mr. Blake gets out of jail, I don't want him near my niece,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorney, Barry Felsen, said his client will be pleased
with the judge's ruling. "This is exactly what should have happened,"
Felsen said, adding that Blake was "most concerned" that Delinah
Blake be allowed to raise the youngest of his three children. Blake
also has an adult son.</TE>
<TE>   Felsen said that Blake's attorneys had been negotiating another
visitation for Bakley, but that those discussions ended last month
when she fired her attorney. He said Delinah Blake will now decide
which relatives may spend time with the child.</TE>

<LD>A federal panel has approved $500,000 to study how to preserve the
natural banks of the San Gabriel River watershed for recreational
uses.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) is seeking to turn the river's
vast watershed--roughly the riverbank lands north of Santa Fe Springs
through Pico Rivera, El Monte, Monrovia and up to the foothills of
the San Gabriel Mountains--into a meandering urban park and
recreational area.</LD>
<LD>   The first step toward receiving government funding to develop such
a recreation system is to commission a Department of Interior study
to examine potential uses for the area.</LD>
<TE>   The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the funding
issue in coming months.</TE>

<HD>Spending of Tax Fund Questioned</HD>
<DH>Finance: Coalition wants city to account for about $17
million set aside for relief, affordable homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Business leaders across Los Angeles are demanding to know what the
city has done with nearly $17 million earmarked for tax relief for
businesses and affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   The Business Tax Trust Fund was created in 2000 to hold money
collected from companies in arrears on their city tax bills.
Three-quarters of the money collected was supposed to provide rebates
and other relief for start-up companies and businesses that had
diligently paid their taxes. The remainder was to be used to
subsidize affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   A coalition of six major business groups complained Wednesday to
Mayor James K. Hahn and Controller Laura Chick that there has been no
accounting of the trust fund since Dec. 31, when the city ended an
amnesty program for business-tax shirkers. At least one of the
coalition's leaders suspects that the money has been rolled into the
cash-strapped city's general fund.</LD>
<TE>   That's not so, Hahn spokeswoman Julie Wong said Thursday, and the
mayor's office will release as early as next week an accounting of
the trust fund in a "comprehensive" review of business tax reform.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $17 million collected during the amnesty period, Wong said,
nearly $8 million has gone to offset tax exemptions for new
businesses and for other changes in the city's tax laws. Another $5
million has paid for a computer system to "make businesses' lives a
lot easier," she said. The remainder--about $4 million--is in the
city's trust fund for affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., the Central City Assn. and
the United, Hollywood, Venice and Mid-Valley chambers of commerce
have asked Hahn and Chick for a written account of how much money the
trust fund has collected and spent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important in today's environment, and always in a
trust fund situation, that you have accountability," said Mel Kohn,
an Encino accountant who heads the city's Business Tax Advisory
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Chick said Thursday that either a "major misunderstanding or
serious miscommunication" between the city's finance office and
Kohn's committee has kept the trust fund records from being
available.</TE>
<TE>   But she added, "I don't think there's going to be any need for any
audit. I think there's a very readily available answer to the
questions" that the business groups are asking.</TE>
<TE>   The trust fund resulted from years of complaints from Los Angeles
companies that the city's tax rates are too high, compared with rates
in other local cities, and, therefore, encourage businesses to set up
elsewhere. Companies that paid their taxes complained that they were
shouldering the burden for scofflaws.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Los Angeles offered amnesty to any business that came
forward to pay past-due taxes. The money collected was to be put into
the trust fund.</TE>
<TE>   Also directed to the fund will be money collected as a result of a
2001 state law that allows cities to collect taxes more thoroughly by
cross-checking their records with those of the California Franchise
Tax Board.</TE>
<TE>   That law could add hundreds of millions of dollars in coming years
to the trust fund, making it all the more important that the city
disclose what it is doing with the money, said Fred Gaines, chairman
of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles businesses are assessed a tax based on their gross
receipts, a method that has drawn complaints from businesses that say
it's a "job killer" that discourages companies from growing. And,
Gaines said, "you can have a business and lose money and still owe
the city a lot of taxes."</TE>
<TE>   In their letter Wednesday to Hahn and Chick, the business
coalition members asked for an outside study of alternative
assessment methods that they proposed last month.</TE>
<TE>   Those methods include a flat rate, a tax only on profits and a tax
on real estate that businesses lease or own.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's upcoming review will not advocate any new methods for
tax assessment, Wong said.</TE>

<HD>Call to Clown Around Answered</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Kansas actor's dream comes true when he's
picked to star under the big top.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dean Kelly has dreamed of being a clown with the Greatest Show on
Earth ever since he was 4 years old, when his grandparents took him
to his first circus in Kansas City.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, his dream came true.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, 21, flew to California from Kansas City, Mo., when he
learned that Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey was holding its
first open auditions for clowns in 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   And after a tryout at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, where the
circus runs through until Aug. 4, Kelly was offered a one-year
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm blown away," Kelly said after shaking hands to seal the deal
with Tim Holst, vice president of production and talent for the
circus.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it. It's my lifelong dream and it's coming true.
It's just very overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly--who makes his living as an actor--was selected from about a
dozen circus clown wannabes who juggled, flipped, flopped and
performed magic in hopes of becoming part of the famous Ringling
Bros. Clown Alley.</TE>
<TE>   It was a little intimidating, he said, to perform in front of
judges who included David Larible, star of this year's circus;
Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, which owns and
produces the circus; and Phil McKinley, director of the circus.</TE>
<TE>   But something about Kelly's Midwestern boyish charm, bright yellow
hair and size 60 blue Converse sneakers caught McKinley's attention
almost immediately. And he liked Kelly's skit of a man whose picnic
is ruined by a buzzing bee.</TE>
<TE>   McKinley also saw promise in some of the others, including Leo
Christopher, 25, whose plaid suit, natural strawberry blond hair
under a bowler hat and smiling eyes conveyed "something that kids
would just fall in love with," McKinley said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, however, was the only one offered a contract.</TE>
<TE>   The circus hasn't held an audition for 30 years because it had
relied on the talent that emerged from Clown College. Based in
Venice, Fla., Clown College offered a rigorous 10-week training
program to amateurs in juggling, acrobatics, physical comedy, gag
construction and other skills.</TE>
<TE>   In 27 years, the college granted degrees in buffoonery to more
than 1,700 performers, including Penn Gillette of the comedy
illusionist team Penn and Teller. But the college closed several
years ago and Ringling Bros. producers thought the Los Angeles area
would be a good place to find some professional clowns.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking for clowns, talented performers," said
Barbara Pflughaupt, a spokeswoman for the circus.</TE>
<TE>   But spotting that indefinable something that makes a clown takes a
practiced eye, said Larible.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't learn to be a clown," he said. "You're either a clown
or you're not."</TE>
<TE>   Larible said he looks for spontaneity, sweetness, harmony and
precision in a clown's movements.</TE>
<TE>   Feld also tries to spot what can't be gleaned in a resume.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I want them to be funny," he said, "but I try to look past
the makeup to see what their heart looks like. I want people who want
to make a difference in young people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Finding that blend is no laughing matter.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, the wide-eyed kid from Kansas, couldn't agree more.</TE>
<TE>   He has studied clowns since he was 4, was vice president of the
Clowns of America, Alley 92, in Kansas, and hasn't missed a circus in
17 years--"I have the programs to prove it."</TE>
<TE>   As the hopefuls went through their gags in the center ring,
McKinley cast a serious eye over the clowns and observed: "Comedy is
serious business, and clowning is the most serious of them all."</TE>

<HD>Mildred Deegan, 82; Star Baseball Player</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mildred "Millie" Deegan, who played 10 seasons with the All-American
Girls Professional Baseball League, died of cancer Sunday in New Port
Richey, Fla. She was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Deegan, who was in the league from 1943 until 1952, spent six
years pitching and playing second base for the Rockford Peaches, the
team featured in the 1992 movie "A League of Their Own." She ended up
with a .260 batting average.</LD>
<LD>   Before switching to baseball, Deegan, who was born in Brooklyn,
N.Y., earned a reputation as "the Babe Ruth of women's softball" for
her hitting prowess. Once at the old Madison Square Garden in New
York City, she hit a softball so far that even Ruth was impressed. He
posed with her and squeezed the biceps on her right arm.</LD>
<TE>   After the release of "A League of Their Own," Deegan told the St.
Petersburg Times that the women playing in the league did have to go
to charm school to become "All-American girls."</TE>
<TE>   Deegan also recalled some low points during her playing days,
including the 1946 championship game against the Racine Belles when
she gave up the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from baseball, she joined a New Jersey softball
team and remained as a coach for about 20 years. She moved to Florida
in 1976.</TE>

<HD>A Farewell to 4 Murder Victims</HD>
<DH>Crime: Friends and relatives try to understand the savage
stabbings. One mourner forgives her brother's killer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Relatives of the four victims stabbed to death in their South
Whittier home spoke Thursday about the murders--the unbearable pain,
the outpouring of love from the community and even forgiveness.</LD>
<LD>   The three women, holding hands, made their comments during a news
conference before the funeral for Miguel Ruiz, 38; his wife, Maritza
Trejo, 41; their 8-year-old daughter, Jasmin; and Ruiz's grandmother,
Ana Luisa Martinez, 79.</LD>
<LD>   "Personally, my faith and my strength has allowed me to forgive
this person who did this," said Olga Ruiz, the sister of Miguel Ruiz.
"He's going to have to answer to a higher authority. And that's not
us."</LD>
<TE>   Olga Ruiz, Raquel Trejo and Kenelly Zeledon--Maritza Trejo's
daughter and sister-in-law, respectively--spoke about the crime,
which left a grisly scene in the unincorporated community that
disturbed even veteran homicide investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Raquel Trejo and Zeledon recounted arriving at the house of the
victims July 13, a Saturday morning, worried because they had not
heard from their family for a day. They got over the fence. Raquel
Trejo stepped into the house first and said to Zeledon: "Something is
wrong here. There's blood everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday Zeledon said, "We have no idea how we have been able
to deal with this. It's the strength that God has provided us. I
close my eyes and I can still picture everything that we saw in that
house."</TE>
<TE>   The three spoke about the compassion they have received from the
community, which has showered them with "money, hugs and kisses.
Something that we will never forget."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has filed
capital murder charges against Alfonso Ignacio Morales, 23, that
could make him subject to the death penalty. He was a neighbor and
family friend of the victims who visited often as he learned from
Miguel Ruiz how to repair computers.</TE>
<TE>   Morales is set to be arraigned today in Norwalk Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral was held at the packed ZOE Christian Fellowship of
Whittier. In the sanctuary stood four coffins with portraits of the
victims next to them. In her picture, Jasmin Ruiz, who prosecutors
say was sexually assaulted before being murdered, wore a blue dress,
long dark hair and a slight smile.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Jasmin, one family member, Felix Alvarado, said:
"Maybe she didn't say much, but with her smile she said everything."</TE>
<TE>   Said Olga Ruiz about Miguel Ruiz: "My brother was not only my
brother. He was in essence my father too. There were times when I
needed a [father figure], and the only person I could turn to when my
father was not around was my big brother Mike."</TE>
<TE>   The four were buried at Olive Lawn Memorial Park in La Mirada.
Their survivors will continue to search for answers. "It's a little
difficult to discuss the whys and hows," Olga Ruiz said. "This is
something we need for closure. Until we know why it happened, our
family won't be able to rest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donations to the Trejo-Ruiz Family Fund can be sent to Community
Resources Center, 10750 Laurel Ave., Whittier, CA 90605. They also
can be deposited at any Wells Fargo branch in account No. 3001084486.</TE>

<HD>Media at Murder Trial Rebuked</HD>
<DH>Court: After hearing that two jurors were followed, the
judge in Van Dam case threatens to ban cameras.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The judge in the murder trial of David Westerfield angrily accused
the media of being irresponsible Thursday, a repeat of early
complaints that the jurist said could lead him to pull cameras from
the courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   After receiving a report that an unidentified person followed two
jurors and wrote down their car license plates, Superior Court Judge
William Mudd threatened to withdraw permission for television and
newspaper cameras to be in the court.</LD>
<LD>   The judge challenged journalists to keep their colleagues from
attempting to discover the identity of jurors.</LD>
<TE>   "This is serious," said Mudd. "I will not tolerate it.... If I
have one more incident like that, I am cutting you off."</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield is on trial in the kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd, 57, appointed to the Superior Court bench in 1988, has
promised jurors that their identities will never be known, a level of
protection not extended even to most jurors in this city who have
heard cases involving violent street gangs, media experts said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Mudd's ire had been raised when a freelance
photographer working for a Web site tried to photograph Westerfield's
18-year-old son, Neal, as he left the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "It is absolutely appalling to this court," Mudd said. "The
scufflings--the stakeouts, if you will--remind me of the paparazzi
for some important movie star."</TE>
<TE>   Mudd had told photographers not to show the son's face during his
time on the witness stand. The teenager testified that his father had
downloaded the thousands of pornographic images found on his
computer.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd's relationship with the media has been a complicated one
during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   But he has allowed television and radio to broadcast the
proceedings live--a first for a San Diego case.</TE>
<TE>   But he has slapped a gag order on everyone connected to the trial,
banished the media during many sessions in which the jurors are not
present, and occasionally ordered that certain witnesses not be
photographed.</TE>
<TE>   In ruling that reporters could not accompany jurors when they
inspected Westerfield's recreational vehicle, he said, "They have no
need to see that."</TE>
<TE>   Media attorney Guylyn Cummins has argued repeatedly that Mudd
should allow greater media access to sessions involving motions filed
by the attorneys and that reporters should be allowed to inspect
search warrants.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd has rejected most requests, and this week refused a request
to call a recess to give the media attorney time to come to the
court.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd has also made a series of comments to jurors suggesting that
the media are inaccurately reporting the trial--although the only
example he has provided is that one television station misreported
the number of years he and his wife have been married.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving on a week's vacation, Mudd repeated his admonition
to jurors not to watch or read accounts of the trial and added that
during his absence the coverage would probably be particularly
inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   "If it isn't live," the judge told jurors, "they will contrive."</TE>
<TE>   Several TV reporters quickly assured viewers that they would not
try to find out the names of jurors. But other journalists called the
practice a routine way to prepare for post-trial interviews--an
effort to illuminate how the jury reached its verdict.</TE>
<TE>   John Beatty, who retired last year after 33 years as a San Diego
journalist, said he was surprised that Mudd "overreacted to such a
common practice.... I'm not sure why he's so frustrated."</TE>

<HD>Getting Protester's Goat Isn't Bad, Monrovia Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 4-week-old goat was left at the Monrovia library Thursday, perhaps
as a protest against the city's controversial plan to use goats to
remove hillside vegetation.</LD>
<LD>   But delighted city officials, one of whom spent the day buying
goat's milk and baby bottles, were not complaining.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if it's a prank, but this thing is so cute," said
Fire Chief Mike DiGiovanna, who scrapped weekend getaway plans to
bottle-feed the kid. "Everyone has fallen in love with it."</LD>
<TE>   If the city manager approves, he said, the Fire Department will
adopt the goat as its mascot.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Monrovia City Council approved a $45,000 grant to
study putting goats in Ruby Canyon, a steep area where vegetation has
not burned for 50 years, Mayor Lara Larramendi Blakely said.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents, including Steve Miller, co-director of the
Foothills Wildlife Conservancy, argued that the goats could destroy
rare native plants without preventing wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he didn't know who had left the animal, which was
discovered at 7 a.m., but he suspected that the act was a statement
on the goat plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt it's an endorsement," he said. "My suspicion is it would
be a criticism."</TE>
<TE>   It's been quite a week for wildlife in Monrovia. On Tuesday,
police and California Department of Fish and Game officials had a
14-hour standoff with a black bear that had taken up residence in a
neighborhood tree.</TE>
<TE>   The bear eventually was tranquilized and trucked to the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The goat, however, is staying.</TE>
<TE>   "She's crying all the time, unless I'm holding her," DiGiovanna
said. "I have more respect for parents, now that I have a kid."</TE>

<HD>Nonprofits Rush to Beat Deadline</HD>
<DH>Grants: Only six groups statewide will get program's funds
to help combat gangs and drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 140 community groups across California, including one in Santa
Paula, scrambled Thursday to meet today's application deadline for a
grant designed to clean up neighborhoods hit hard by gangs and
drugs--even though the number of grant recipients has been slashed to
six.</LD>
<LD>   Organizations awarded one of the coveted California Gang, Crime
and Violence Prevention Partnership grants could see nearly $1
million pumped into their budgets over the next four years.</LD>
<LD>   And leaders of the Santa Paula effort say the grants are key to
providing alternatives to youths in danger of getting pushed into a
life of crime and incarceration. All the organizations serve
low-income areas prone to violent street gangs, high crime and
single-parent homes.</LD>
<TE>   The grants, which funneled a steady supply of cash into 15
nonprofit agencies in high-crime areas during the past four years,
have been a casualty of the ongoing budget crisis in Sacramento. That
means first-time applicants such as Santa Paula will compete for nine
fewer slots, with dozens of other agencies either attempting to renew
their grant or reapplying after being rejected in 1998, the first
year of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Legislature has yet to agree on a budget for 2002-03,
officials administering the grants have been told they will receive
only half of the earlier annual allocation of $3 million. State
officials passed on the bad news last month at a gathering of grant
writers and nonprofit directors at a San Diego conference.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those things where everyone is having to cut,"
said Steve Hedrick, assistant director of the crime and violence
prevention center at the state attorney general's office, which
administers the grant.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hopeful [the money] will go back up, but it doesn't look
like it will. That's the reality at this point."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, where the Santa Clara Boys &amp; Girls Club would
administer the grant, officials said the money would go a long way
toward giving choices to children.</TE>
<TE>   Boys &amp; Girls Club officials estimate that the grant, representing
$237,500 annually through 2006, could pay the salary of a
gang-prevention coordinator as well as a job-placement expert. The
grant also would fund a school-based police officer and pay part of
the salary of a deputy district attorney who would work part time on
truancy issues.</TE>
<TE>   A cut in the money available also means nine agencies that
received the grants four years ago will be forced to either eliminate
jobs and programs started with the money or find new ways to pay for
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take a good chunk out of the services that we can
provide," said Corey Dantzler, vice president of operations for the
Challengers Boys &amp; Girls Club in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Dantzler said the club, which operates in a former supermarket,
serves about 450 youths a day from ages 6 to 17 in the busy summer
months and has a membership of 3,500. Losing the grant would trim the
club's $1-million budget by more than $200,000 and put an end to some
valuable educational programs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "With these funds we had done things we had not done in the past,
like technology and science programs and things that have been taken
out of schools," Dantzler said. With today's deadline in mind,
Dantzler, Santa Paula Boys &amp; Girls Club Director Pat Zwagerman and
other agency directors around the state spent much of Thursday buried
in paperwork as they tried to construct a winning application.</TE>
<TE>   A committee of state-appointed law enforcement experts and social
workers will spend next week sifting through applications. The six
recipients will be announced Aug. 14, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "[State officials] are going to get bombarded with people saying
the same thing," said Mike Jump, a grant writer in the Ventura County
district attorney's office who has worked on the Santa Paula
application. "The trick will be how you say it."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Recycling Firm Files for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Courts: Halaco seeks bankruptcy protection. But
environmental groups say it's trying to avoid a pollution lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halaco Engineering, an Oxnard metal recycling plant under fire by
regulators, has filed for bankruptcy protection in a move that
critics charge is designed to hold up an environmental lawsuit
against the company.</LD>
<LD>   The Chapter 11 petition, filed this week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Santa Barbara, would allow the company to continue operating while
seeking protection from creditors--and plaintiffs in civil
lawsuits--as it reorganizes its structure and finances.</LD>
<LD>   A bankruptcy lawyer for Halaco said a lawsuit filed last year by
the Santa Barbara-based environmental group Channelkeeper has
strapped the company's resources to the point that bankruptcy
protection was its only option. The federal lawsuit alleges that the
company is releasing toxic materials into the air and water.</LD>
<TE>   "When you're taking the managers away from the operation of the
business and making them focus their time and energies on depositions
and production of documents and hearings, it's very difficult," said
attorney Lawrence Peitzman.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Bohan, Channelkeeper's executive director, said Halaco's
filing came as the group was preparing to ask a federal judge to rule
in its favor. Channelkeeper must now convince a judge to let the case
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "It throws a huge wrench into the works," Bohan said of Halaco's
move. "It's consistent with the way the company operates."</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme resident and City Council candidate Maricela Morales,
who lives blocks from the smelting plant, urged the environmental
group to challenge the bankruptcy protection filing.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of what we are seeing on the national level with larger
corporations," she said, "I think it's all the more important not to
allow Halaco to get away with using another tactic to avoid taking
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Plant manager Dave Gable said Halaco is in financial straits and
had no other option.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of strategy to bankruptcy," Gable said. "We
hope to be able to stay in business."</TE>
<TE>   Court documents show that Halaco owes at least $239,000 in
lawyers' fees and $168,000 to other companies with which it does
business. Gable declined to discuss company finances Thursday, but in
an interview two years ago, he told The Times that Halaco employed 50
people and had $10 million in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   Peitzman, the Los Angeles attorney representing Halaco in the
bankruptcy proceedings, said that without bankruptcy protection,
Halaco was concerned it could not continue complying with demands set
forth earlier this year by the Regional Water Quality Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   "The company believes it can work its way through this situation
and emerge from Chapter 11 in compliance with governmental
regulations and serving its customers," he said. "The company's in
the recycling business. It's an environmentally friendly company."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Krop, chief counsel for the Environmental Defense Center in
Santa Barbara, co-plaintiffs in the Channelkeeper suit, put no stock
in Halaco's contention that the lawsuit brought the company to its
knees.</TE>
<TE>   "We filed the lawsuit a year and a half ago, and they could have
spent their money addressing the concerns and cleaning up their
facility," Krop said. "Instead, they decided to spend their money on
lawyers and obstructing our case every step of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Halaco set up shop in 1970 on 41 acres at Oxnard's southern tip.
Nearby, Ormond Beach's wetlands are home to protected species
including the tidewater goby and the California least tern.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, millions of pounds of aluminum and magnesium scrap are
melted at the plant. The recycled product is sold to soda bottlers
and car companies. What is left is pumped into waste ponds and then
accrues on slag heaps that have grown to 40 feet high.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors have long complained of foul smells and black soot. The
company also has tangled for decades with regulators, consistently
defending its right to operate.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency sued in 1980, alleging that
waste was being discharged into the wetlands, but the state Supreme
Court ultimately ruled in Halaco's favor. The California Coastal
Commission also lost a bid in the 1980s to impose stricter
regulations on the company. In 1992, the EPA identified heavy metals
from the site leaking onto Ormond Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the company has sued officials with the Ventura
County Air Pollution Control District and threatened legal action
against members of the Regional Water Quality Control Board if they
acted in a way the company believed to be overreaching.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the water board said it had evidence that ammonia
and other toxic chemicals were seeping into the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Channelkeeper filed its lawsuit. Then in March of this
year, the Regional Water Quality Control Board imposed tighter
restrictions on the company, including an order that Halaco stop
adding to its slag heap by the end of this year. The company has said
it will be able to do so with new filtration equipment it has
purchased.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Deputy Files Sexual Harassment Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sheriff's deputy has filed a sexual harassment suit against the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, alleging that the then-head of
the department's training bureau repeatedly threatened and groped her
and that the department has a pattern of discriminating against
female employees.</LD>
<LD>   Irene Desmarteau, a 13-year veteran of the department, charges
that Capt. Rufus Tamayo demanded that she perform sexual acts with
him in exchange for promised promotions. Desmarteau said she was
passed over for numerous positions, despite high marks on tests and
in interviews.</LD>
<LD>   "My lifelong dream has been to work in law enforcement,"
Desmarteau said Thursday. "I have been a deputy sheriff for 13 years,
and my only fear is that by coming forward, I have jeopardized my
career with the Sheriff's Department."</LD>
<TE>   The suit, filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
accuses the county and the Sheriff's Department of creating a
"hostile and offensive work environment" through "express and implied
threats of retaliation and disparate treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Tamayo was relieved of duty with pay in April from the Sheriff's
Department, which is conducting an internal investigation into his
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit comes as the department continues efforts to comply
with a consent decree stemming from a 1980 sexual discrimination
lawsuit that it unsuccessfully appealed to the state Supreme Court.
The judgment and legal fees cost the county about $20 million,
sheriff's officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The consent decree required the department to develop and
implement a sexual harassment and discrimination policy, which is
scheduled to take effect later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The county counsel's office, which represents the Sheriff's
Department, did not return repeated calls for comment about the new
suit. Sheriff's officials said they had not yet read the suit and had
no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the court orders from the 1980 case, Desmarteau's
attorney, Richard Love, charges in the suit that the department has
continued to discriminate against women in hiring, promotion and
transfers.</TE>
<TE>   According to the suit, Desmarteau applied for several promotions
from 1998 to 2001 but was rejected for each position and was not
given a reason. Love alleged in the suit that his client was denied
the positions partly based on her gender.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, the suit says, Tamayo began telling Desmarteau
that he was connected to high-ranking people in the department and
had helped several deputies' careers. A few months later, it says,
Tamayo began threatening her and demanding sexual conduct. He sent
e-mails saying he was thinking of her and complimented the deputy on
her appearance, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate to switch from her job in background investigations,
Desmarteau nonetheless asked for Tamayo's help. She began working in
the training division in June 2001 as an "executive deputy."
Desmarteau alleged that for the next several months, Tamayo
repeatedly touched and groped her and suggested that she owed him
sexual favors. He also implied that any advancement within the
department would be based on her compliance with his demands, the
suit says.</TE>
<TE>   She also alleged that Tamayo continually asked about her sex life
with her husband and urged her to divorce him.</TE>
<TE>   Desmarteau did not willingly consent to the alleged sexual conduct
and did not report it for fear of her safety and of retaliation
against her or her husband, who also works for the Sheriff's
Department, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Tamayo, who joined the department in 1973 as a deputy, served as a
sergeant and lieutenant before being promoted to captain and being
appointed by Sheriff Lee Baca to lead the training bureau, the suit
says. Tamayo first left the department on medical leave in December,
soon after the death of his wife.</TE>
<TE>   After Desmarteau discussed Tamayo's alleged conduct with a
supervisor, an internal affairs investigation was opened. It is still
pending. Desmarteau went on disability leave this spring, her
attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Love is asking for a jury trial, but did not specify the amount of
damages his client is seeking.</TE>

<HD>Richard T. Liddicoat, 84; Gemologist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard T. Liddicoat, whose contributions to gemological education,
diamond quality grading, gem identification, gemological research and
instrument development earned him an international reputation as the
"father of modern gemology," has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Liddicoat, the former president and lifetime board chairman of the
Carlsbad-based nonprofit Gemological Institute of America, died
Tuesday in his Los Angeles home after a long illness."He really was
one of the best-known figures in the gem world and, of course, the
Gemological Institute of America is the foremost educational and
research organization in the gem world," said Anthony R. Kampf,
curator of mineral sciences at the Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   "If anyone could be called the dean of the jewelry industry in
very loving and genuine terms of respect and endearment, it would be
this man--Dick Liddicoat," said Michael Kazanjian, chairman of a
wholesale jewelry company in Beverly Hills, who knew Liddicoat for 40
years and served on the Gemological Institute's board of governors.</LD>
<TE>   Liddicoat was known throughout the jewelry industry and
gemological community for his pioneering efforts in advancing the
science of gemology and for his innovations, most notably his
development of the International Diamond Grading System in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   The method, which has become the industry standard, evaluates
diamonds on the basis of the four Cs: cut, color, clarity and carat
weight.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was using his own system, to the extent that the
terminology was so varied it was impossible to know the true quality
of an individual stone," Liddicoat recalled in a 1979 interview with
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "We also felt some systems were meaningless, giving the dealer no
clear guide in setting the price of a stone," Liddicoat said. "With
our system, the dealer knows, sight unseen, the quality of the
diamond."</TE>
<TE>   Dawn Moore, West Coast sales director for Harry Winston in Beverly
Hills, which specializes in high-quality diamonds, said: "Mr.
Liddicoat, being the architect of the grading system for diamonds,
was someone so pivotal in the industry that he allowed a jeweler such
as Harry Winston" to be in business.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other companies that offer diamond grading, but they're
not as prestigious or as accepted," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Born on March 2, 1918, in Kearsarge, Mich., Richard Thomas
Liddicoat Jr. was the son of a professor of engineering at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by his two immigrant miner grandfathers to explore the
geology of the surrounding area as a boy, Liddicoat went on to earn a
bachelor's degree in geology from the University of Michigan in 1939
and a master's in mineralogy in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after earning his master's, Liddicoat learned that his
mineralogy professor had recommended him for an opening as assistant
director of education at the Gemological Institute of America in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Liddicoat jumped at the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "After years of school, I was ready to do something else," he said
in a 1980 interview. "The idea of gems and Los Angeles really had
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   The Gemological Institute of America was founded in 1931 by Robert
M. Shipley, a former Wichita, Kan., jeweler whose goal was to fill
the vacuum in gem education.</TE>
<TE>   Shipley started by delivering a series of lectures through USC.
They were so successful that he established a correspondence program
for gemology. Until that time, there was no formal gemology program
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Gemological Institute has three resident education
programs in the United States and affiliates in eight other countries
and is considered the world's premiere educational institute for
gemology.</TE>
<TE>   Before the educational efforts of the institute, a Los Angeles
colored stone dealer, George Houston, said in a 1979 Times article,
jewelers learned the business by the "seat of their pants."</TE>
<TE>   "The old-timers, particularly in New York, resisted any formalized
education, which GIA was advocating," he said, referring to the
institute. "But GIA persevered, convincing virtually everyone that
education was just as important to the jewelry and gem business as it
was in any other field of activity."</TE>
<TE>   Within a year of Liddicoat's hiring as an instructor, he was named
director of education at the institute. When World War II broke out,
he served as a weather officer on aircraft carriers in the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to the institute after the war, he was named director of
research and later director of education and research.</TE>
<TE>   Liddicoat succeeded Shipley in 1952 as executive director (later
retitled president) and led the institute until 1983, when he retired
as president and was unanimously elected chairman of the board.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he was named chairman of the board for life.</TE>
<TE>   Liddicoat served as editor in chief of Gems &amp; Gemology, the
institute's professional journal, from 1952 until his death. He also
wrote "The Handbook of Gem Identification," "The Diamond Dictionary"
and "The Jeweler's Manual."</TE>
<TE>   He also was a founding member of the board of directors of the Gem
and Mineral Council of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County and was instrumental in the growth of the museum's gem
collection.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, in recognition for his contributions to gemological
knowledge and education, the National Museum of Natural History named
a new gem species of tourmaline in his honor: Liddicoatite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to talk in superlatives about this man because he was
really a pioneer in transforming our industry into something much
more credible ... than it ever could have been," Kazanjian said.</TE>
<TE>   Liddicoat's wife of 56 years, Mary Imogene "Gene," died in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   A celebration of Liddicoat's life will be held at 4 p.m. Aug. 24
at institute headquarters, 5345 Armada Drive, Carlsbad.</TE>

<HD>Blessed Be the Dodger Fan, Fated to Wait Till Kingdom Come

<LD>The Dodgers have been so miserable lately that I don't think they
stand a prayer of making the playoffs. Too bad the founder of their
radio station--now KXTA-AM (1150)--isn't around to work a miracle.
They could really use the divine contacts of Aimee Semple McPherson,
the flamboyant evangelist who broadcast her "Sunshine Hour" from the
Angelus Temple in Echo Park from 1923 to her death in 1944. If
nothing else, I think a stern lecture from Sister Aimee would shake
the Dodgers out of their lethargy.</LD>
<LD>   For those of you who haven't been keeping score: The Dodgers
haven't won a playoff game since 1988 (remember the 1900s?). I recall
the time a caller to KXTA was asked to relate his most treasured
moment as a Dodger fan. He couldn't think of any. "I'll be honest,
guys," he said. "I'm only 19."</LD>
<LD>   Ask me how I gained 50 pounds! Henry Sands spotted an ad for a
formula that helps you add something I don't need: flab (see
accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of calories: Ray Barnecut of Long Beach saw a chicken
wings' offer from a company that believes you should get what you pay
for--no more, no less (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Barking up business: Then again, if you want to lose some weight,
Eloise Thro Greenstone of Laguna Woods noticed that a restaurant
seems to be offering a shrub buffet (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Interactive entertainment? Kingsley McDonough came upon an ad for
a resort that offered you the chance to participate in movies (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about you, but most movies I go to see these days
don't make me want to jump in. They make me want to leave the
theater.</TE>
<TE>   Trash-talking: Marlene Gordon's Pasadena-based Next Stage Tours
presents such events as the Insomniacs Tour of businesses open before
sunrise; L.A.'s Ups and Downs Tour of picturesque elevators and
escalators; and a Chocolate-Covered L.A. Tour of candy shops with,
yes, free samples. Now she's organizing a Best of the Worst Tour of
L.A., which would include visits to a landfill, a treatment facility,
a car-crushing business and a flower disposal site as well as a
lecture on trash. And, of course, the tour bus will pause for
refreshments when it becomes enmeshed in a traffic jam on the San
Diego Freeway at rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon vetoed her husband's suggestion to visit a morgue, but I
think a stop at the coroner's gift shop would be fun. It has a fine
selection of towels and other items adorned with a body outlines.</TE>
<TE>   The lost L.A. expedition: Gordon experienced the ultimate
nightmare of a tour operator the time she was buying tickets for a
Red Line trip to a surprise destination. Her customers hopped on
board ahead of her, she said, "like kids let out of school for summer
vacation." Gordon was still buying her ticket when the Red Line car's
doors shut. She pounded on the door to no avail. She yelled to her
guests, but they couldn't hear her.</TE>
<TE>   The subway train took off without her. She and her customers
"watched each other disappear from sight," Gordon said. "They didn't
know where they were going." Fortunately, a worker saw what happened
and called ahead to the departed train, telling the tour folks where
to disembark.</TE>
<TE>   That, Gordon adds, is the only time she lost a tour group.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The freeway obstacle du jour Friday was a bathtub,
which fell out of a truck on the Santa Ana Freeway in Newport. It was
not occupied at the time.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Johannes Degenhardt, 76; German Prelate</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Johannes Joachim Degenhardt, one of the first German bishops
to drop a counseling program that paved the way for an abortion, died
of heart failure Thursday. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Degenhardt died at his residence in Paderborn, one of the most
heavily Catholic parts of Germany. A spokesman for the archdiocese
said his death was unexpected.</LD>
<LD>   Appointed cardinal last year by Pope John Paul II, Degenhardt had
conservative views. He halted participation in a program to counsel
pregnant women, a step that is required before they can obtain
abortions in Germany. He also was known as an advocate of political
cooperation in Europe and tolerance between Germans and foreigners.</LD>
<TE>   In 1992, he made headlines by removing Father Eugen Drewermann's
right to celebrate Mass, after Drewermann challenged the virgin birth
and other basic church tenets.</TE>
<TE>   Degenhardt was born in 1926 in Schweim, in the Paderborn
Archdiocese. In 1941, at age 15, he was arrested and imprisoned by
the Gestapo for three weeks for his work as a youth leader in the
Catholic group Bund Neudeutschland, or New German Union, which was
banned by the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   He was briefly imprisoned by the Allies at the end of the war
because he worked for the German air force, but was released in 1946
and returned to school. He was ordained in 1952. He became a bishop
in 1968 and archbishop in 1974.</TE>

<LD>Maria Adela Gard de Antokoletz, 90, one of the founding members of
the Argentine human rights group Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, died
Tuesday in Buenos Aires. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   De Antokoletz was one of 14 women who founded the group early in
the 1976-83 military dictatorship that saw at least 9,000 political
opponents of the regime abducted, tortured and killed.</LD>
<LD>   The group is known for marching every Thursday outside the
president's offices to demand information about relatives who went
missing in the junta years.</LD>
<TE>   De Antokoletz was born Oct. 11, 1911. She was working for the
Buenos Aires provincial courts when she helped found the group to
seek information about her son Daniel, a constitutional lawyer who
was abducted in November 1976. At the time, he was also a university
professor and defender of political prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   She died without learning the fate of her son.</TE>

<HD>Dr. Chaz M. Holder, 55; Created New Way to Make Prosthetics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Chaz M. Holder, 55, a triple amputee who invented a new way of
making prosthetic limbs, died of a heart attack July 4 at his home in
Fayetteville, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Holder devised lightweight, more comfortable prosthetic limbs that
can be fitted in about 15 minutes. He sold the prosthetic arms and
legs, for which he developed a technology that requires no socket to
fit the remaining part of an amputated limb, through his company,
CZBioMed Enterprises. He distributed the devices free to amputees in
Third World countries.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Holder and his invention received one of five $50,000
awards presented by the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose in
recognition of new technologies that benefit humanity.</LD>
<TE>   Just before his death, Holder had completed the first phase of a
contract with the Army to provide prosthetic devices to be used for
clearing minefields. The device provides up to two feet of additional
distance from a mine.</TE>
<TE>   Holder lost his left arm below the elbow in an industrial accident
in the late 1970s and about eight years ago began to incrementally
lose his legs during successive operations. Doctors attributed the
deterioration of his legs to a near-fatal race-car accident in 1980
and exposure to chemicals during his Army service in the Vietnam War,
according to Holder's business partner, Ruth Clark.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., Holder majored in art and English at
Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and earned a doctorate in
engineering in fine arts from Drake University in Des Moines. He
graduated from Phnom Penh Wat Medical College in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia, although he was never licensed as a doctor in the United
States.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California asked a federal appeals court to reverse its June ruling
declaring the Pledge of Allegiance an unconstitutional endorsement of
religion.</LD>
<LD>   The move follows the June 26 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals that set off a wave of protest.</LD>
<LD>   A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based court, ruling 2 to
1, barred the practice of reciting the pledge in school because of
the phrase "under God" that Congress inserted in 1956.</LD>
<TE>   Under circuit rules, the court can rehear the case with the same
three judges or with an 11-judge panel. The court also can allow the
decision to stand.</TE>
<TE>   There is no timeline for the court to act.</TE>

<HD>It's Official: Supervisors Place Valley Secession on the
Ballot</HD>
<DH>Breakup: The board's action follows resolution of wording
on the costs to taxpayers of a split.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors took final action
Thursday to put San Fernando Valley cityhood on the Nov. 5 ballot,
after resolving a dispute over how voters will be informed about the
cost of secession.</LD>
<LD>   The board's unanimous vote to formally schedule the election
followed a so-called protest hearing that generated little protest in
the end.</LD>
<LD>   Just 8,809 of the city's 1.45 million voters filed written
protests to the secession election, and only 10 addressed the board.
Under state law, to stop the election, half of Los Angeles' voters
would have had to file protests.</LD>
<TE>   And although the board's role in setting the secession election
was largely routine, its drafting of the ballot measure language
proved crucial to both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents lobbied the supervisors to include in the
measure's wording the annual separation payments a Valley city would
have to make to Los Angeles. Backers of Valley independence labeled
that effort an attempt to mislead and frighten voters. They said such
ballot language would falsely imply that secession would increase
costs to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors struck a compromise Thursday that seemed
acceptable to all. The ballot wording will contain a passage on the
separation payments, but will make it clear that they do not involve
new costs.</TE>
<TE>   The 20 years of payments would compensate Los Angeles for tax
revenues lost to Valley independence. They represent the amount of
taxes paid by Valley residents in excess of the value of city
services the region receives. They would be $127.1 million the first
year and decrease by 5% annually.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure will describe the payments as "the difference
between the revenue collected in the San Fernando Valley area by the
city of Los Angeles in fiscal year 2000-2001 over and above the
amount expended by the city of Los Angeles in the Sam Fernando Valley
area ... "</TE>
<TE>   Secession campaign leader Richard Katz said he was pleased with
the final language, but would have to work hard to ensure that voters
understand it.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Katz said Thursday's action marked a "historic"
moment in the breakup campaign's six-year battle to get secession on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in the Valley are going to get to vote on
self-determination," Katz said. "It will change the way the city will
function forever for the better."</TE>
<TE>   For the Valley to become a separate city of 1.35 million people,
the ballot measure must win in the Valley as well as citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said he also was happy with the
wording of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "The [payment] figure had to be included," Middlebrook said. "It's
10% of the Valley city's budget, and it probably was subject to the
most debate of any issue debated."</TE>
<TE>   The board's decision also set the stage for an election for mayor
and 14 council seats in the proposed Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates can now circulate petitions to qualify for the ballot.
The paperwork deadline is Aug. 9. If secession loses, none of the
offices will be filled.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure will also give voters a chance to pick from
five names for a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Local Agency Formation Commission is scheduled to take
the last step in placing the Hollywood secession measure on the same
ballot. The panel is also expected to approve ballot language that
will portray the Hollywood separation payments in terms similar to
that of the Valley measure.</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood city would have to pay Los Angeles $21.4 million the
first year, with the amount decreasing by 5% a year. A change in
state law gave LAFCO final authority over the Hollywood election.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Katz, a former assemblyman, faced City Council
President Alex Padilla in a debate Thursday about Valley cityhood
before the Southland Regional Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, a Valley native, made his case armed with economic
statistics. "If there was a poster child for not getting our fair
share, it's the northeast Valley," he said. But the councilman
painted secession as a financially and politically risky way to bring
change.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said secession is "about having a say in the future of our
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, a coalition of religious and civil rights groups
rallied in Studio City to announce its plans to fight secession,
saying a breakup would hurt the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition includes the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the Muslim
Public Affairs Council, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, and the
American Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition members said they feared that a new Valley city would
fail to enact Los Angeles laws designed to protect the poor and
elderly.</TE>

<HD>Sequoia Blaze Keeps on Burning</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Some critics call on the Forest Service to revise
its policy on allowing campfires in high-risk areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL and MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KERNVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In the midst of a disastrous fire season across the West, the
campfire remains a tradition unchanged in much of the Sequoia
National Forest, where a 57,000-acre fire continued to burn late
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Campers in many parts of this forest can still cook their meals
over wood or kerosene flames beneath pines and cottonwoods.</LD>
<LD>   It was a campsite at a place called Road's End where Peri VanBrunt
set up last Sunday. She would later tell people that she had been
preparing to cook hot dogs in a designated "safe fire" area when the
blaze broke out.</LD>
<TE>   As of Thursday, the slow-moving fire had not entered any of the
groves of giant sequoia trees for which the forest is named. About
1,500 additional acres had burned, far fewer than in previous days.
But the blaze had landed the 45-year-old Bakersfield mother in jail
and raised questions whether the U.S. Forest Service had tempted fate
by allowing campfires in this of all fire seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Sequoia National Forest supervisor, Art Gaffrey, acknowledged
Thursday that the forest was so dry it seemed like August, not July.</TE>
<TE>   And yet the Forest Service had not changed its long-standing
practice. It would allow campers in the busy months of summer to
build fires and cook over stoves in some locations, including the
area where the fire started, a stretch of rock, sand and a little
brush near a road and a river.</TE>
<TE>   The agency deemed other sections of the forest off-limits to such
activity because of the fire danger.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffrey said Thursday that the Forest Service would take a second
look at those areas where campfires are still permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffrey likened the situation to a freeway: If everyone followed
the rules, there would be no accidents. "I've been here for 6 1/2
years, and I've never closed the dispersed areas to campfires," he
said. "They've always provided a safe area as long as the regulations
are followed."</TE>
<TE>   Gaffrey said he didn't know what had happened in the moments
before the fire started. But, like other officials, he described
VanBrunt as the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if she had the fire circle cleaned," he said. "Did
she have a shovel? Was she tending the fire?''</TE>
<TE>   VanBrunt is scheduled to be arraigned this morning in U.S.
District Court on felony charges of setting the fire. If guilty, she
could face five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Special agents with the U.S. Forest Service have said VanBrunt has
admitted starting the fire, but has insisted that it wasn't
intentional and that the fire escaped her control. The agents said
she had not obtained a fire permit before entering the forest.
VanBrunt has no criminal history related to fires. In 1998, a judge
sentenced her to 16 months in state prison after she pleaded guilty
to a methamphetamine charge.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Gary, and two children live in a large,
rundown old house in Bakersfield. A U.S. flag and an Oakland Raiders
banner hang from the front porch. Six abandoned automobiles litter
the yard. A sign in the window says: "Private Property, Stay Off."</TE>
<TE>   "Peri has told people that she did everything she could to put out
the fire, but nobody would help her," said a neighbor, Raquel
Gonzales. "Peri is a good neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the fire continued to blacken the slopes of the Kern
River Valley, although it had so far spared groves of some of the
nation's largest and oldest trees--including the General Sherman in
Sequoia National Park, miles to the north, which stands 274 feet
tall.</TE>
<TE>   The wildfire, Gaffrey said, was slowing down, and crews were
holding the line on the western side of the blaze, which borders a
giant sequoia grove. "The conditions have looked the best I've seen
them."</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, the blaze was about 10% contained, a forest service
official said, adding that it could be a week or more before the fire
is completely contained.</TE>
<TE>   Battered by weeks of 100-degree-plus heat, people in Bakersfield
and Fresno typically flee in two directions every summer. They head
west to the Central Coast or east to the national forests.</TE>
<TE>   They look for a few days' break from the smog and the dust of the
harvest, a chance to cook over a campfire and to sleep next to the
ocean or beneath the giant sequoias.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service is loath to deny them their summer
respite. And yet, when communing with nature produces fire, as it did
this week, critics of the Forest Service wonder whether the policy
needs to be altered.</TE>
<TE>   They say the Forest Service dragged its heels in managing the
sequoia groves, failing to reintroduce prescribed burns as a way to
reduce the dead wood and underbrush that have fueled this fire.
Logged areas, they say, have been too heavily replanted with young,
small trees that burn hotter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very dry and arid forest, and the logging program has
increased the brush and flammability of the forest," said Charlene
Little, a Kernville resident who sits on the board of Forestkeepers,
a conservation group.</TE>
<TE>   Campfires are permitted along the entire 18-mile strip where
VanBrunt was camping legally.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffrey said he had driven by the spot where the fire began and
had seen a singed trailer, but he wasn't sure if it belonged to
VanBrunt.</TE>
<TE>   The fire "hit grass" and exploded, he said. "This is not a usual
occurrence." The Forest Service banned campfires earlier this summer
north of Lake Isabella because of the fire danger, but it left open
the Kern River Valley.</TE>

<HD>Audit Focuses on UC Staffing</HD>
<DH>Education: The system increased state spending on
nonteaching staff more quickly than on faculty from 1997 to 2001,
study shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A report released Thursday by the Bureau of State Audits found that
the University of California system is increasing its spending of
state revenues on nonteaching staff faster than on academic faculty.</LD>
<LD>   From 1997 to 2001, total salary expenditures of tax dollars
increased by 28% for nonteaching support staff, including
researchers, secretaries and janitors. At the same time, overall
spending on faculty salaries increased by 18%, according to the
report.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy Elkins, president of the University of California Council
of the American Federation of Teachers, said the audit proves that
the university used too much state money to hire administrators and
relies too heavily on less-costly lecturers instead of
professor-level faculty to teach.</LD>
<TE>   But the system contends that the audit findings simply reflect
what it takes to run a complex, modern university, especially the
explosive growth in staff needed to keep new computer and Internet
systems running.</TE>
<TE>   The system also stressed that only about 30% of the $11.57 billion
it spent last year came from state funding. The rest came from
tuition, donations, endowments, hospital fees, federal research
grants and other sources, some of which support faculty salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The report also found that, over the five-year period, the number
of people hired in four support staff categories--management, fiscal
and staff services, student services and administration--grew at
rates much higher than faculty hiring. Those four nonteaching groups
increased staff by between 26% and 67%, compared to a 9.5% rise in
tenure-track faculty.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the state directed the nine-campus UC system to improve
student access to undergraduate education, hire more teachers and
improve the academic experience.</TE>
<TE>   Elkins said California is not spending enough money on teachers
and is not living up to the state's requirements. "It does seem to be
a failure of the public trust, and it raises a question about the
university's accounting system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Schwartz, a UC spokesman, said the audit does not draw any
conclusions that the university is not meeting its goals to improve
undergraduate education.</TE>
<TE>   The auditors "didn't find any reason to express concern in the
report that we were not spending state funds consistently with the
[goals for which] they were provided," Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he said, the UC system has recently decided to
reallocate $10 million over the next two years from instructional
support and academic administration to the instruction program to
hire more faculty and improve undergraduate education.</TE>

<LD>The remnants of Hurricane Douglas were felt along the Newport Beach
coast Thursday, bringing waves up to 12 feet and catching hundreds of
swimmers in accompanying riptides, authorities said. Newport Beach
Fire Department lifeguards rescued about 200 people. Among them was a
man who suffered a fractured collarbone in the surf and a group of
about 15 people struggling with the tide, said Capt. Eric Bauer.</LD>
<LD>   "At least 200 lives were saved today," he said. "They all would
have been [seriously injured] if the lifeguards were not there."</LD>
<LD>   Lifeguards estimated that 80,000 people visited the Newport Beach
shore Thursday, said Lt. Rob Williams. Many came to watch the surfers
tackle the high surf, others to escape the heat inland. In
preparation, the Fire Department increased the number of lifeguards
and staffed additional towers.</LD>
<TE>   More than 100 people gathered at the Wedge, a prime surfing site
in Newport, to watch the swells. "This is the first good day of the
summer," said bodysurfer Scott Corngold, 31, of Newport Beach.
"Hurricane swells are among the best wave producers in this area."</TE>
<TE>   While surfers rejoiced, lifeguards encouraged the public to be
extra careful, because the big waves and riptides are expected to
continue through the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "The surf is really dangerous," Williams said. "If you're not an
expert swimmer or surfer, we recommend that you stay in shallow
waters."</TE>
