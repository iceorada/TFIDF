<LD>What Is Papyrus?</LD>
<LD>   If you've ever seen ancient scrolls covered with
hieroglyphics--symbols that stand for words--you've seen papyrus, one
of the oldest surfaces used for writing and painting. In fact, the
word "paper" comes from "papyrus." But make no mistake, papyrus is
made in a completely different way.</LD>
<LD>   Papyrus is actually a reed-like plant that grows in moist soil,
near rivers and ponds. In ancient Egypt it was harvested from the
banks of the Nile River. Although papyrus was also used in early
Greek and Roman civilizations, it was very important to the
Egyptians, who learned to turn the reed into a sturdy writing
surface.</LD>
<TE>   The country produced a lot of papyrus and exported it to other
places. But with the invention of paper in China, which eventually
made its way to Egypt, the production of papyrus declined and then
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   To make papyrus, the Egyptians would peel away the outer layer,
cut the stems into strips and soak them in water. After soaking, the
strips were pounded with stones and flattened. The strips were then
set side to side, with a second layer placed on top. They were
pounded again and left to dry. Finally the surface was polished to a
smooth finish by rubbing with a stone or block of wood.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington grows papyrus plants on the north bank of its lily
ponds. The plants grow to a height of 6 to 10 feet and have large,
round flower clusters that look a bit like exploding fireworks or
feather dusters. Can you imagine turning these stalks into a papyrus
scroll and then writing a story on it in hieroglyphics?</TE>

<LD>* My favorite ride is Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain. It makes
me feel scared because there's a really high hill at the top and
sharp curves immediately at the bottom. I like it because I love to
be scared and I love roller coasters. And it is so fun to ride with
all the sharp turns and hills. It's so awesome.</LD>

<TE>   * My favorite amusement park ride is Ghost Rider at Knott's Berry
Farm. It goes really fast and I love it.</TE>
<TE>   --Caroline, 9</TE>
<TE>   Verdala International School</TE>
<TE>   Island of Malta</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite amusement park ride is Jurassic Park ... The Ride.
It is at Universal Studios Hollywood. When I ride it, it feels weird
and scary because there's a fall that goes really fast and you see a
dinosaur that scares you. Then you go down the fall and water
splashes you a lot and when you get off you are very soaked.</TE>
<TE>   --Christine, 10</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Street Elementary</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is the Mad Tea Party teacups at Disneyland. I
enjoy it because it makes you dizzy. It is fun because it goes so
fast I can't see anything when I'm riding it.</TE>
<TE>   --Thannya, 9</TE>

<TE>   * My favorite ride is Space Mountain at Disneyland. It makes me
feel like I'm flying in space because it's pitch-dark and there are
lit-up planets. I like it so much because it goes so fast.</TE>

<LD>The albatross fledgling tried and tried to fly but getting his heavy
body off the ground wasn't easy. He flapped his wings up and down, up
and down and ran slowly along the rough ground. Plunk, plunk went his
big feet as he tried to push off into the air.</LD>
<LD>   "Come on, you can do it!" Sally cried.</LD>
<LD>   "Not so loud, Sally," Uncle Stanley reminded her. "We mustn't
scare him."</LD>
<TE>   "Just like a girl," Peter said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a girl and I'm being quiet," Fran said with a grin. "And
Sally's just concerned about the fledgling."</TE>
<TE>   Sally grabbed Fran's sleeve. "How long will it be before he can
eat?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, first he has to fly from here to the edge of that cliff."
Fran pointed to a spot that to Sally seemed far away. "Then he has to
take off from there and fly down to the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long way down," Uncle Stanley said, remembering the
steepness of the cliff and the hard, black rocks below where the
Pacific Ocean crashed and boomed.</TE>
<TE>   "And some of the birds don't make it."</TE>
<TE>   Sally shuddered. "Can't we carry him or something?"</TE>
<TE>   "That wouldn't help him, Sally," Uncle Stanley said. "He has to
learn to do it for himself."</TE>
<TE>   "Nature is mean, don't you think?" Peter asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Nature is very practical, Peter. She knows that experience is a
good teacher."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I'm not an albatross," Sally said.</TE>
<TE>   "See!" Fran jumped to her feet. "He almost made it that time. Come
on, gooney bird, we're all rooting for you!"</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will the fledgling albatross make it to the cliff and
beyond?</TE>
<TE>   Eve Begley Kiehm has studied the albatrosses that live on the
island of Kauai in Hawaii. There is a large colony of them at the
Kilauea Lighthouse. A few "loners" have their nests in the cliffs.

<LD>   Lowe to Depart 'West Wing' in '03</LD>
<LD>   Rob Lowe will leave "The West Wing" next spring, NBC said
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The actor, who plays White House deputy communications director
Sam Seaborn, decided to depart after finding out that Martin Sheen
received a raise that nearly triples his pay to $300,000 an episode,
Variety and the New York Post reported, citing anonymous sources.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe, who has been earning about $75,000 an episode since the
series began in 1999, is reportedly the only cast member who failed
to get his first-season salary increased. Co-stars Allison Janney,
Richard Schiff, John Spencer and Bradley Whitford banded together
last year and negotiated a raise to about $70,000 per show in a deal
that keeps them on through the seventh season.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe was one of the biggest names on the show when it began, thus
commanding a higher salary. But his importance receded as other
members of the ensemble broke out.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as it hurts to admit it, it has been increasingly clear,
for quite awhile, that there was no longer a place for Sam Seaborn on
'The West Wing,' " the actor said in a statement. Professing his
gratitude at having been on the show, he added, "We were a part of
television history and I will never forget it."</TE>
<TE>   Though NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker wouldn't provide
reasons for Lowe's departure, he confirmed that the actor will be
written out of the show in March.</TE>

<TE>   'American Taliban' Song Ignites Controversy</TE>
<TE>   A new tune about John Walker Lindh by Nashville singer-songwriter
Steve Earle is making waves on the music front.</TE>
<TE>   The song, "John Walker's Blues," describes Lindh as "an American
boy raised on MTV" who sought out another culture because he felt
alienated from his native country. "If my daddy could see me
now--chains around my feet/He don't understand that sometimes a
man/Has to fight for what he believes," Earle sings.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, a 21-year-old Californian captured by U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, pleaded guilty this month to fighting alongside the
Taliban militia. He is expected to be sentenced to 20 years in prison
in October.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville radio personality Steve Gill says Earle is trying "to be
outrageous to attract attention."</TE>
<TE>   "We're within a one-year period of the attacks on America, and I
think it's too early for a song like this," Gill told CNN. "He is
free to put this song out there, and the American people are free to
say 'No, thank you' when it comes to buying it."</TE>
<TE>   Earle wasn't available for comment, but Charles Wolfe, a pop music
scholar at Middle Tennessee State University, came to the singer's
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "What Earle is doing is what good songwriters--and in fact, good
poets--have been doing for a hundred years, which is trying to get
inside and understand the motivations of people who may not be
popular right now," he said, comparing the song to Bob Dylan's tune
about the boxer convicted of murder, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, or
Woody Guthrie's songs about the gangster Pretty Boy Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   Artemis Records is releasing the song in September, a move the
label defends. "It would be a pretty shallow culture if songwriters
only wrote about nice people," Chairman Danny Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann to Tackle Alexander the Great</TE>
<TE>   Having completed a trio of musicals ("Strictly Ballroom," "William
Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" and "Moulin Rouge"), Baz Luhrmann has
signed on to direct Dino De Laurentiis' historical epic about
Alexander the Great for 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The project is due to start shooting early next year in Morocco,
where the king has committed about 1,500 members of his army to the
production. That will put it ahead of other Alexander the Great
projects undertaken by Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKE</TE>
<TE>   Women in Film has tapped Rosie O'Donnell, "Judging Amy" stars Amy
Brenneman and Tyne Daly, and ABC Cable Networks Group/Disney Channel
Worldwide President Anne Sweeney as this year's winners of the Lucy
Award, named after Lucille Ball. The honors will be presented at the
Century Plaza Hotel on Sept. 20.</TE>

<LD>The Dave Matthews Band's "Busted Stuff" entered the nation's album
chart on Wednesday at No. 1 after registering the third-highest
first-week sales this year, SoundScan reported.</LD>
<LD>   The collection sold 622,000 copies, a figure exceeded only by
Eminem's "The Eminem Show," which sold 1.3 million during its first
week in the stores in May, and Nelly's "Nellyville," which sold
714,000 in its first week in June. The band's last album, 2000's
"Everyday," sold 730,000 copies in its first week.</LD>
<LD>   Nelly's album dropped to second place, selling 305,000, bringing
its four-week total to 1.8 million. Eminem's album placed third on
the chart after selling 211,000 copies. The collection's total sales
are now 4.3 million.</LD>
<TE>   The remaining spots in this week's Top 10 were claimed by the Red
Hot Chili Peppers, Avril Lavigne, Irv Gotti, Styles, Ashanti,
Counting Crows and Josh Groban.</TE>
<TE>   After the Matthews Band, the highest-placing new release was the
Vines' "Highly Evolved," which ranks No. 11 based on sales of 64,000.
The Australian group is part of a cadre of new rock bands, including
the White Stripes and the Strokes, that has begun building momentum
in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   On the singles sales chart, Wyclef Jean's "Two Wrongs" bumped the
remix version of Elvis Presley's 1968 recording, "A Little Less
Conversation," out of first place. Bruce Springsteen's "The Rising"
finished second, with Presley at No. 3.</TE>

<LD>8pm Pop Music</LD>
<LD>   Ben Kweller has fronted a punk band, Radish, which put out a
major-label album, then disbanded. Then he released a self-produced
solo album ("Freak Out, It's Ben Kweller" in 2000) and an EP.
Recently, he signed a deal as a solo artist with the indie label ATO
Records. And he still hasn't turned 21. The musician, born in
Greenville, Texas, and based in Brooklyn, N.Y., visits the Southland
this week, performing songs from "Sha Sha," his new album, filled
with melodic pop hooks and running stylistically from proto-punk to
country-tinged rock.</LD>
<LD>   Ben Kweller, the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. With My
Morning Jacket and Pony League. 8 p.m. $10. (310) 278-9457.</LD>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   He's the man, the man with the Midas ... ahem, he's "Austin Powers
in Goldmember." Actually, he's Mike Myers, who plays Austin Powers.
And Dr. Evil. And any number of other characters as the spy spoof
makes its third time-travel trip. Beyonce Knowles of Destiny's Child
and Michael Caine join the usual suspects for the transition from
swingin' '60s to funky '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "Austin Powers in Goldmember," rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo,
crude humor and language, opens Friday in general release.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Times" is a comedy about a lonely Chinese bachelor who at
long last finds love but becomes desperate for the money to pay for
an elaborate wedding. Directed by Zhang Yimou, whose historical
epics, such as "Red Sorghum," "Raise the Red Lantern" and "Shanghai
Triad," established him as a director of international reputation,
the film is a bittersweet portrait of old-fashioned mores coming into
conflict with modern entrepreneurship. Zhao Benshan, Li Xuejian and
Dong Jie star.</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Times," rated PG for thematic elements and language, opens
Friday in selected theaters.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Poetry</TE>
<TE>   Poet Richard Anthony Dedeaux was once quoted as saying, "There are
no mistakes in poetry." There's certainly no mistaking the original
sound of three of the first voices to rise out of the ashes of the
1965 Watts riots--the Watts Prophets. Wordsmiths Father Amde
Hamilton, Otis O'Solomon and Dedeaux will appear at C. Bernard
Jackson's Legacy Tribute as part of the Grand Performances summer
series. These performance poets, who began long before rap was
popularized, took the tragedy of their times, fused jazz to their
message and continue to update and incorporate thought-provoking
social commentary in their presentations.</TE>
<TE>   The Watts Prophets, Grand Performances, California Plaza
Watercourt, 350 S. Grand Ave., downtown L.A., 8 p.m. Free. (213)
687-2159.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 local music makers performing over a two-night period
make up the lineup at Earjam III, a sampling of "eclectic aural
resonances" produced by Julie Adler and Jacki Apple. Among the many
Friday performers are Ronit Kirchman, Vinnie Golia, Jacqueline
Humbert, Many Axes (Susan Rawcliffe, Brad Dutz and Scott Wilkinson)
and Wayne Peet.</TE>
<TE>   Earjam III, Furious Theatre at Armory Northwest, 965 N. Fair Oaks
Ave., Pasadena, 8 p.m. $12; $20 for two nights. (323) 662-4683. Also
Saturday, 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   10pm World Music</TE>
<TE>   Mali's venerated Super Rail Band returns to the Southland this
weekend. After a decade-long hiatus, the band toured the U.S. last
year and produced a string of enthusiastically received concerts. As
one of the early practitioners of Afro-pop from the West African
country--singer Salif Keita was once a member--Super Rail Band offers
an intoxicating stew of Cuban jazz, American blues and rock and West
African rhythm, all topped by the brilliant guitar work of Djelimady
Tounkara.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Rail Band, Conga Room, 5364 Wilshire Blvd., L.A., 10
p.m. $18 to $45. (323) 938-1696. Also Saturday with Amadou and Mariam
at California Plaza, 350 S. Grand Ave., downtown L.A., 8 p.m. Free.
(213) 687-2159.</TE>
<TE>   8:30pm Music</TE>
<TE>   Gershwin returns to the Hollywood Bowl, again, for two weekend
performances showcasing vocalist Audra McDonald and pianist Kevin
Cole. David Alan Miller conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and
the program is familiar: excerpts from "Porgy and Bess," "An American
in Paris," "Rhapsody in Blue" and other hummable songs.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Philharmonic and soloists, Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland
Ave., Hollywood, 8:30 p.m. $3 to $90. (323) 850-2000. Also Saturday,

<LD>8pm Dance</LD>
<LD>   These are fast times for the dancers in Orange County's own Ballet
Pacifica. Besides participating in the company's 12th annual Pacifica
Choreographic Project--a three-week workshop from which new ballets
emerge as works in progress--they're rehearsing pieces by Choo-San
Goh and Ann Marie DeAngelo for the upcoming "BalletFest 2002" at Cal
State L.A. (on Aug. 2). The Choreographic Project this year showcases
the creative talents of Shawn Hounsell of Les Grands Ballets
Canadiens; Ryan Kelly of New York City Ballet; Davis Robertson from
the Joffrey; and Sarah Slipper of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. As
usual, Ballet Pacifica artistic director Molly Lynch moderates a
discussion between the choreographers and the audience after the
performance.</LD>
<LD>   Pacifica Choreographic Project, Ballet Pacifica, Irvine Barclay
Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine, 8 p.m. $22 to $55. (949)
854-4646.</LD>
<TE>   7:30pm New Music</TE>
<TE>   Composer Joe Potts and his ensemble amalgamate live instrumental
and vocal performances with dance, tape, sampling and projections,
using--among other devices--the Chopped Optigan. This is described as
a portable home console organ and "the ultimate drone machine." All
this takes place indoors/outdoors at the Schindler House.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Potts Ensemble, Schindler House, 835 N. Kings Road, West
Hollywood, 7:30 p.m. $9 to $15. (323) 651-1510.</TE>
<TE>   all day Jazz</TE>
<TE>   From the 1920s through the 1950s, Central Avenue was the bustling
spine of L.A.'s African American district, a street lined with jazz,
dance and supper clubs that featured celebrated performers such as
Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Lionel Hampton, Lena Horne and
Sarah Vaughan. The seventh annual Central Avenue Jazz Festival will
pay tribute to the avenue and that era with two days of free, nonstop
jazz. Performers will include some avenue originals such as Gerald
Wiggins, Teddy Edwards and the Gerald Wilson Orchestra plus such
newcomers as Oscar Brashear, Justo Almario and the Banda Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Central Avenue Jazz Festival, 4225 S. Central Ave., L.A.,
Saturday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 7:30 p.m. Free. (213)
473-0628.</TE>
<TE>   Midnight Movies</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, movie trailers have become stolid Cliffs Notes
versions of the films they purport to promote. They recapitulate the
plot, spoil the ending and can actually turn you off to a movie that
you might've wanted to see. The New Beverly Festival of Trailers,
however, celebrates the lost art of the great movie trailer with two
hours of classics, cult favorites and exotica. Mining the vault of
L.A.'s last true revival house, the event presents an eclectic mix of
"previews" and "coming attractions" that will remind you of forgotten
faves and enlighten you with unknown gems.</TE>
<TE>   New Beverly Festival of Trailers, New Beverly Cinema, 7165 Beverly
Blvd., L.A. Saturday, midnight. $5. (323) 938-4038.</TE>
<TE>   3pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   The good-time message of Sheryl Crow's recent hit "Soak Up the
Sun" makes her a natural to headline the Jeep World Outside Festival
on Saturday. Others on the main-stage part of the entertainment
lineup are Train, Ziggy Marley, O.A.R. and Silvercrush. Besides the
music, the festival offers exhibits by such outdoors-oriented
companies as REI and, of course, Jeep, as well as booths with
information and exhibits on environmentalism.</TE>
<TE>   Jeep World Outside Festival, Verizon Wireless Amphitheater, 8800
Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. 3 p.m. $25 to $55. (949) 855-9063.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   "California Scenarios" is a sequence of five short plays about the
Latino experience in California--all crafted for and staged in Isamu
Noguchi's Costa Mesa sculpture garden representing the California
landscape. A new script by Richard Coca will augment pieces by Luis
Alfaro, Joann Farias, Anne Garcia-Romero and Jose Cruz Gonzalez that
had a sold-out run last year. The site-specific pieces were
commissioned and produced by South Coast Repertory.</TE>
<TE>   "California Scenarios," Noguchi Garden, behind the Comerica Bank,
611 Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa. Previews Thursday and Friday, 8 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday, 8 p.m. Also Tuesday to Aug. 4, 8 p.m. $10. (714)
708-5555.</TE>
<TE>   10pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   The title of the latest album by Louisiana-born DJ Q-Burns
Abstract Message is "Invisible Airline," but its seductive
electronica has been turning up on the in-flight playlists of real
airlines, as well as on the night-flight playlists of dance clubs
like the Echo, where he performs Saturday. Q-Burns, a.k.a. Michael
Donaldson, got hooked as a kid on tape recorders and ambient sounds
instead of electric guitars when he started listening to his mom's
copy of the Beach Boys' masterpiece "Pet Sounds."</TE>
<TE>   Q-Burns Abstract Message, the Echo, 1822 Sunset Blvd., L.A. 10
p.m. $9. (213) 413-8200.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>

Era, rehearse for a song- and tension-filled reunion concert in
William Mesnik's critically acclaimed drama about love and loyalty,
"Three Songs."</TE>

<HD>Cherry Makes a Key Move to Plush 'Electroclash' Gig</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cherry, the Friday night dance club that ushered in L.A.'s glam rock
revival, is moving to one of the hottest clubs on the Sunset Strip.
On Aug. 16, Cherry makes its debut at West Hollywood's Key Club.
Promoters Bryan Rabin and Mike Messex plan to pump up the volume with
an "electroclash lounge" in the downstairs Plush room and DJs Messex
and Joseph Brooks spinning everything from current rock (the Strokes,
the Hives, the White Stripes) to New York's electric edge (Peaches,
Miss Kittin).</LD>
<LD>   Rabin says he plans to take the dance club's theatrical elements
up a notch too. To wit, Cherry's male and female go-go dancers are
already practicing their moves on the Key Club's aerial equipment.
Look out below!</LD>
<TE>   And now, a word from the parking fairy: On Friday nights, you can
park at 9000 Sunset Blvd. for five bucks, the same fee guests paid at
Cherry's old home, A.D., which plans to move its current Thursday
night dance club to Fridays.... For those who can't get enough of
"Sex and the City," the Key Club on Sundays is offering martinis,
manicures and make-overs, climaxing with a screening of the beloved
HBO series. The event starts at 7 p.m. and is located in Plush, the
downstairs VIP lounge (be sure to make guest-list inquiries in
advance to [310] 274-5800).... Promoter Macafrica's Industry Tuesday
at Moomba in WeHo has turned into a weekly treat. Pianist-movie star
Jeff Goldblum performs at 9 p.m., and he's one cool cat. The jazzy
guy always makes an effort to chat with guests after each
performance.</TE>
<TE>   So that super-cute spinderella DJ Panic (a.k.a Meredith Chinn) is
tripping the light fantastic at Backstage in Beverly Hills on
Thursday.... And we hear that Muhammad Ali's been caught chillin' at
R. J.'s in Beverly Hills. Now there's a champ to holla at....
Wednesday night's super-cool experimental DJ hub Twine, located in
the Knitting Factory's AlterKnit room, is presenting a bash for
international techno superstar John Tejada's Palette Records on
Wednesday. Apparently, Tejada's Detroit style is so smooth, Twine's
coming undone.... And speaking of the Knitting Factory, I'm so
totally counting the days till Camper Van Beethoven's appearance
there on Aug. 29. The radical Santa Cruz band rocked the '80s.</TE>

<HD>Your Waiter as Cupid</HD>
<DH>At Koreatown nightclubs, if you see someone interesting,
your server will ask that person to join you--a 'booking'--and pickup
lines are avoided</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINNY CHIEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After lounging around with buddies for a couple of hours in one of
Koreatown's booming nightclubs, Teddy Lee got impatient. He flagged
down a waiter and told him, "Hey, try to bring that girl over, the
one in the white dress." Ten minutes passed, and voila, said girl
arrived at his table.</LD>
<LD>   Lee, a business owner from Los Angeles, was taking advantage of
"booking," a ritual at Korean clubs that cater to twentysomething
Asians in which waiters will physically pull women from their seats
to meet men at other tables. Playing cupid can mean big business for
the servers, who earn money from tips, so it's no wonder that some do
everything in their power within harassment laws to make a love
connection.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't meant to be this time for Lee and his lady in white.
The stylish young woman with flawless makeup politely made small talk
and then excused herself to the restroom at Le Prive, the largest and
arguably most popular club in Koreatown. It's not uncommon for
bookings to wind up this way. Even when two people hit it off,
relationships facilitated by a waiter often end at the door.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a tool for social interaction," says Lee. "You meet a
lot of nice people, but like in any bar or club environment, it's not
a good way to meet someone who you would really want to date. I've
never met anyone who I would consider having a serious relationship
with."</TE>
<TE>   Clubbers of either sex can decline bookings, of course, but
waiters rarely take no for an answer without further prodding. On a
recent Saturday night at Le Prive, a persistent waiter was overheard
urging, "Oh, c'mon, I promise he's really nice!" After a few more
minutes of screaming over the music, the woman put down the Gucci bag
she was clutching, and the matchmaker eagerly pulled her by the elbow
across the room to a table where four men were seated nonchalantly.</TE>
<TE>   Women may initially refuse to be booked because they're "trying to
play hard to get," says another waiter dressed in a crisp white shirt
and black pants who, like nearly all the employees at the club, uses
a nickname instead of his real name on the job. Other women skip the
act and make the most of the situation, appreciating the fact that
they don't have to deal with clumsy pickup lines.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot of girls who will just go and won't really say
anything, but I try to be civil and talk to them," says Ellen Sim of
Alhambra. "I think it's easier to meet people, in the sense that both
the guy and the girl are taken out of the equation. It's not as
uncomfortable as going up to someone yourself."</TE>
<TE>   The ritual originated in the early '90s in South Korea's "booking
clubs," which exist solely for the purpose of introducing singles to
one another. Taking the initiative to fraternize with men is
considered unladylike for women in the largely conservative,
male-dominated country, so the hotspots offered a satisfactory
solution.</TE>
<TE>   At the clubs in L.A., any woman not on the dance floor is fair
game. Women may be approached for bookings as many as five or six
times in an evening, while men just have to keep in mind the rules of
engagement: offer to buy a drink and never offer the inner seat to a
booth, in case she wants to leave. And unlike Korea, in the U.S. a
woman can request to meet men--though this rarely happens--and she'll
be taken to his table.</TE>
<TE>   All of this compulsory mingling proves too much for some, who call
booking, at best, male chauvinism, and at worst demeaning to women.
"I prefer to meet people on my own," says Tom Wang of Alhambra, who
tried the scene but now steers clear. "The clubs make it seem as if
men are a higher class of human beings than women. It's all a big
show for the male ego--the fancy cars, the bottles of XO [whiskey],
the pretty girls. The women are like commodities."</TE>
<TE>   Still, men and women are lining up to get in. At Le Prive, the
massive, two-story space attracts young professionals and college
students to its gothic-themed playground, complete with gargoyles.
Waiters don headsets to help monitor the crowds. Oversized booths
surround the sprawling dance floor, where a DJ plays hip-hop and
trance music, mixing in the occasional Korean song. The second floor
houses private rooms with karaoke machines for celebrities and large
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Karnak, a smaller club nearby, draws a slightly older--as in late
20s, early 30s--crowd. While most Korean nightclubs feature the same
setup--tables circling a dance area, lights and records
spinning--Karnak distinguishes itself with a live band, which belts
out pop covers between DJ sets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a neighborhood where nightspots pop up and disappear months
later with little fanfare, Karnak and Le Prive have continued to
thrive. Karnak has been open for five years, Le Prive for nearly
three.</TE>
<TE>   It's only a few miles from Hollywood, but the night-life scene in
Koreatown operates under totally different rules. Clubs usually
require a reservation--if it's busy, you're not getting in without
one--but that guarantees a table, complete with fruit spread or
appetizers, for the entire evening. Instead of a cover charge,
there's a minimum purchase of a bottle of whiskey or cognac. Other
selections from the bar are limited to a few beers and not much else.
The tab for four comes to about $200, plus a customary 20% tip.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hefty price to pay, but worth it to many club-goers who
feel more at home among the mostly Korean and Chinese crowd. Only a
handful of non-Asians, usually men, can be found on the busiest
nights. "I go out to other places, too," says Sim, "but I just feel
more comfortable hanging out with people who I know come from a
similar background."</TE>
<TE>   Le Prive, 721 S. Western Ave., L.A. Open nightly, 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.
21 and older. (213) 381-7007.</TE>
<TE>   Karnak, 3319 Wilshire Blvd., L.A. Open nightly, 9:30 p.m. to 2
a.m. 21 and older. (213) 380-1030.</TE>

<HD>Italian Cuisine With a Spark of the Beach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAX JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take a million-dollar view and add good Italian food. Presto: You
have Spark Woodfire Cooking, a casual Italian place where you come
for pizza, roast meat and serious wines by the glass, to say nothing
of that view.</LD>
<LD>   Spark Woodfire is on the mezzanine level of a busy shopping and
cinema complex in Huntington Beach. There was a time when all you
could get around here was a smoothie or a burger, but this beach town
of competitive surfers, bodybuilders and in-line skaters has come of
age as an eating destination since the opening of Chimayo Grill
across the street from here, followed by the upscale Chinese bistro
Red Pearl around the corner.</LD>
<LD>   Getting to Spark Woodfire on a busy summer night can be a
challenge--Pacific Coast Highway is a mess, even the bike path across
the street is crowded--but the rewards are considerable. This
handsome space, formerly a Louise's Trattoria, has been completely
redone as a villa with straw-colored walls and lots of dark wood. On
warm evenings, the best tables are on a broad porch that looks
directly out onto the Pacific. If it gets cool, there are portable
heaters.</LD>
<TE>   Chef Tom Shields cooked at the Newport Beach steakhouse Bungalow
before taking over the stoves here, so he knows the beach crowd and
its tastes. I have eaten at the original Spark in Studio City several
times, and I find it interesting to see how differently people eat in
the two locations. Valley people evidently like pizza and salad. In
Huntington Beach, it's meatloaf, flatiron steak and loads of
rotisserie chicken, all cooked on the restaurant's wood-fired
rotisserie.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, I always start a meal here with a pizza. It's the
same sort of pizza you'd get at Alto Palato, the Studio City Spark or
any corner pizzeria in Rome, for that matter, meaning that it's
wafer-thin, has a delicately crunchy crust that is slightly blackened
on the bottom, and is topped with authentic Italian ingredients. You
can't go wrong with the simple pizza Margherita with tomato sauce,
mozzarella cheese and fresh basil, but I'm a sucker for the pizza
topped with arugula, prosciutto and shaved pecorino cheese.</TE>
<TE>   I can't resist the soups, either. Pappa al pomodoro is a soothing
bread and tomato soup, but even better here is ribollita, a hearty
vegetable soup served with a crust of Italian bread sticking out of
the middle of the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The salads are fine, too, even though I prefer to concentrate on
pizza and roast meat when I'm here. When I do crave a salad, it is
the Spark Cobb, a mix of chopped Romaine with roast chicken, fried
pancetta, crumbled blue cheese and sunflower seeds (of all things) in
a refreshing buttermilk herb dressing. I'm also fond of the Caesar,
mostly for its polenta croutons.</TE>
<TE>   Now for those rotisserie meats. My first choice is porchetta, a
leg of pork crusted with pepper and herbs, fatty and flavorful but
not, by design, as moist as American roast pork.</TE>
<TE>   Another good one is the lemon-and-herb-roasted chicken, its crisp
skin liberally brushed with rosemary, garlic and olive oil. The scent
of wood permeates the flesh, just as in American barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad the Italian sausage is too salty, and the Italian
meatloaf, made with a mixture of beef, pork and veal, is somewhat
generic. You can taste all three of these by ordering the arrosto
misto platter.</TE>
<TE>   There's a lot more here that merits attention. Burrata caprese is
a whole-milk mozzarella served with tomatoes, basil and olive oil.
It's almost impossibly rich (the center is mostly cream) and hard to
categorize as an appetizer, main course or side dish.</TE>
<TE>   Herb-crusted Alaskan halibut, moist and perfectly done from the
wood grill, comes with green beans and chive mashed potatoes. Among
the pastas, one of the best is penne with a beef and sausage ragu, a
meaty sauce punctuated by plum tomatoes and red peppers.</TE>
<TE>   Good dessert choices include a tiramisu, Italian bread pudding and
a rich cheesecake with a thick graham cracker crust. There are also
terrific Italian gelati, as good as you can get on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian restaurant renaissance has finally arrived in
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Spark Woodfire Cooking, 300 Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington
Beach. (714) 960-0996. Lunch, 11:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Saturday-Sunday.
Dinner, 5-10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday; 5-11 p.m., Friday-Saturday. Full
bar. Validated parking in structure. All major cards. Dinner for two,
$29-$47.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: burrata caprese, any pizza, Spark Cobb salad,
ribollita, porchetta, roasted chicken.</TE>

<DH>The Festival of Preservation is a cinematic treasure trove</DH>

<LD>Despite all the sunshine, or maybe because of it, Los Angeles tends
to be a hidden city, a place whose great treasures are not always the
obvious ones. So it is that the city's most surprising, most
stimulating, most invigorating film event is not the Oscars, not even
one of L.A.'s sprightly film festivals, but the UCLA Film and
Television Archive's splendid and irreplaceable Festival of
Preservation.</LD>
<LD>   This year's festival, the 11th, kicks off tonight with a gala
screening at the Directors Guild of a luscious three-strip
Technicolor restoration of Joseph Mankiewicz's "The Barefoot
Contessa" (1954), starring Humphrey Bogart and an intoxicatingly
beautiful Ava Gardner.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first of more than 40 features, television and newsreel
programs to be shown at UCLA's Melnitz Hall in a monthlong festival
that runs through Aug. 24 and showcases spectacular new prints of
classic films like John Cassavetes' "Shadows" (1959), Max Ophuls'
"Letter From an Unknown Woman" (1948), the Cary Grant-Irene Dunne
"The Awful Truth" (1937) and Kirk Douglas' unforgettable "Champion"
(1949).</LD>
<TE>   As impressive are the festival's lesser-known lustrous gems, which
involve stars ranging from Charles Laughton to Roy Rogers, featuring
them as we're not used to seeing them.</TE>
<TE>   When the Festival of Preservation began life in 1988, it was not
so grand an affair. In fact, then-archive director (now dean of the
School of Theater, Film and Television) Robert Rosen remembers that
"when I decided to call it the Festival of Preservation, everyone
said I was out of my mind. Call it classics, treasures, anything.
Preservation smells like dust."</TE>
<TE>   Dust, in fact, was more or less what a surprisingly large
percentage of feature-length films (fully half of those produced
before 1951, including 90% of silent films) were threatening to turn
into. As the largest university archive in the country (second in
size only to the Library of Congress) UCLA had taken the lead in
restoration, in bringing films back to the way they were originally
seen, without scratches, fading or discoloration. A festival seemed
the ideal way to showcase what the archive--a 56-person organization
that has preserved 346 features since 1977--had accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   Key to making the UCLA fest as extraordinary as it's become is the
remarkably wide range of films it has put on display. No other event
in the country has so consistently illuminated the irresistible
hidden treasures of America's movie history, putting a spotlight on
drop-dead-fascinating items unseen in decades and difficult to see
after the festival.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, these have included:</TE>
<TE>   An all-but-unknown alternate version of Howard Hawks' "The Big
Sleep" (1946), based on the Raymond Chandler novel and starring
Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Though few people were aware of
it, much of the Bogart-Bacall byplay that is "Sleep's" best-loved
feature was added so late that 18 minutes of key
exposition--recovered and preserved by UCLA--had to be cut, leading
to the film's famously confused plot, which even Chandler said he
couldn't follow.</TE>
<TE>   A spectacular restoration of Budd Boetticher's laconic western
"Seven Men From Now" (1956), starring the granite-faced Randolph
Scott and Lee Marvin as his outlaw nemesis and all-around leering
miscreant. The film's vivid color and lean story line made it the
surprise success of the 2000 New York Film Festival, but the
preservation fest had it months before.</TE>
<TE>   A rare 1933 melodrama, "The Sin of Nora Moran," that boasts one of
the most unusual structures in American film, featuring an
opium-induced dream state in which the past and the present are so
intertwined that the heroine bargains with characters in her dream so
certain real-life events won't take place. To see "Nora Moran" on the
big screen, where she belongs, you had to be at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the films UCLA has preserved have had as much of a story
behind the screen as on it. That is especially true with one of the
archive's most significant restorations, a 1926 Vitaphone
short--unseen in public for 70 years, and thought to be intentionally
destroyed--in which a relaxed and confident Al Jolson says his
trademark "You ain't heard nothin' yet" a full year before he used it
in "The Jazz Singer."</TE>
<TE>   Once "The Jazz Singer" became a sensation, the earlier, livelier
short was withdrawn and made to disappear. Or so it was thought until
the Library of Congress found a copy in a mislabeled can. Just as
difficult to locate was the Vitaphone disc holding the soundtrack.
Only one could be turned up, but it had been broken into four pieces
and awkwardly glued back together. A record collector in the Pacific
Northwest spent months dissolving the glue and refitting the pieces.
Then UCLA preservation officer Robert Gitt transferred the contents
to tape with the help of a tilted turntable and strategic blowing on
the tone arm.</TE>
<TE>   Given how many treasures the Festival of Preservation has
unearthed in the past, the question with each new edition becomes,
can they top themselves this time around? In 2002, at least, there's
no need to worry, with pride of place going to a once-in-a-lifetime
Aug. 15 program called "Charles Laughton Directs 'The Night of the
Hunter': A Presentation of Outtakes From the Film."</TE>
<TE>   Eager to save time and keep his cast in the mood, Laughton,
contrary to typical Hollywood practice, kept the camera running as he
instructed actors Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters and Lillian Gish
between takes of his memorable 1955 film. Eight hours of these
rushes, which also include different line readings and alternate
camera angles, survive, and they are the basis for the program in
which UCLA's Gitt, who masterminded the restoration, walks us through
two hours of the best of the trims.</TE>
<TE>   To watch these outtakes is to feel almost present at the creation
of a classic motion picture. We hear Laughton reading off-screen
lines for his actors, calming them down when they flub things, being
incredibly patient with child performers Billy Chapin and Sally Jane
Bruce, and best of all, giving simple but incisive advice like "a
little more lyrical, more personal" and "darling, it's a little too
firm" in his soothing voice. As an intimate portrait of a director
fully on his game, these sequences are unmatched.</TE>
<TE>   That these outtakes survived at all is something of a miracle.
They sat untended for years, likely in a garage, until Laughton's
widow, Elsa Lanchester, decided she wanted the space. She donated the
film to the American Film Institute's Greystone campus in 1974, where
students, not realizing what they were, began cutting them up for use
as blank leader in their productions.</TE>
<TE>   This was immediately stopped and the rushes eventually wound up at
the UCLA archive, where Gitt and his team worked on and off for
almost 20 years assembling, splicing and sound-syncing the footage,
making it possible, as Gitt says, to view scenes "unseen since
Laughton and editor Robert Golden left them on the cutting-room floor
47 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   For those who have never seen the finished film, called by the
director "a nightmarish sort of Mother Goose tale," or even for those
who have, UCLA's stunning new print (screening on Aug. 10) showcases
cinematographer Stanley Cortez's expressive visuals, including some
of the most artistic black-and-white scenes ever recorded. As
Francois Truffaut, writing in Cahiers du Cinema, accurately said, "it
makes one fall in love with an experimental cinema that really
experiments and a cinema of discovery that actually discovers."</TE>
<TE>   If "Night of the Hunter" whets your appetite for more Laughton, he
can be seen in two other extremely different projects, "The Man on
the Eiffel Tower" (1949), and "Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd"
(1952). The latter film has Laughton looking as if he's having great
fun coping with the lunatics of the title. "When the guys get through
with him," the trailer boasts, "he's the only pirate ever to have a
nervous breakdown."</TE>
<TE>   "Tower" is an early example of American independent filmmaking.
Star Franchot Tone bought the rights to a Simenon novel and enlisted
two friends to appear: Laughton, as phlegmatic Inspector Maigret; and
Burgess Meredith (who also directed) as a prime suspect.</TE>
<TE>   What "Tower" is most noted for today is its position as the first
American color film shot entirely in Paris. Photographed by Cortez
(who met his future "Hunter" director on this project), the city gets
prominent fifth billing in the credits. It is charming to see how
Paris looked just after the war, complete with ancient buses and
massive Renault taxis, and the scenes of the actors clambering on the
tower's superstructure for the film's climax are still remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   Bogart also makes a second appearance in the festival, starring in
"Knock on Any Door" (1949), only the third feature for director
Nicholas Ray, already in possession of his gift for socially
conscious melodramas that were character-driven as well as
atmospheric. A passionate attack on the social causes of delinquency,
"Knock" features Bogart as a top lawyer who fought his way out of the
old neighborhood but ends up defending a young delinquent accused of
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Also in "Knock," John Derek gets his first featured role as the
delinquent, Nick "Pretty Boy" Romano, "the Skid Row Romeo" whose
motto actually was "Live fast, die young and leave a good-looking
corpse." Variety called Derek, later to be the husband of Bo, "a new
bobby-soxer dream and a persona who will click with the femmes,
motherly or otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   As always, some of the most offbeat viewing in the festival
involves silent and early sound material. "Sideshow" (1928), for
instance, stars real-life midget Little Billy Rhodes, as feisty as a
miniature Edward G. Robinson, as the owner of a problem-plagued
traveling circus. His co-star is Marie Prevost, who died a celebrated
early death and was immortalized decades later in the Nick Lowe song
that takes her name.</TE>
<TE>   The festival is also featuring a series of Vitaphone shorts from
the 1920s, early sound films that provide a faithful,
window-on-the-past record of vaudeville acts of the period. Preserved
this time are such performers as the all-girl band Harry Wayman and
His Debutantes and Chaz Chase, billed as "The Unique Comedian" for
his willingness to eat just about anything, from a ukulele to a lit
cigar.</TE>
<TE>   Very much in the low-budget department is "Vanity Fair" (1932),
taken from the Thackery novel but shot in modern dress in 10 days,
often until 3 or 4 in the morning, to save money for Allied Pictures,
its Poverty Row studio. It stars a vivacious Myrna Loy, on loan from
MGM, and quite a contrast to Miriam Hopkins, who played the same role
in the gorgeous "Becky Sharp" (1935), a three-strip Technicolor
feature showing on the same bill.</TE>
<TE>   Equally highbrow is "The Private Affairs of Bel Ami" (1947),
written and directed by Albert Lewin and based on a Guy de Maupassant
story. It stars George Sanders in a prototypical role as a suave
ultimate cad who is irresistible to the women of 1880s Paris, very
much including Angela Lansbury. The film's beautiful blacks and
whites are matched on the same program by a fine new print of Ophuls'
romantic classic, "Letter From an Unknown Woman."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not quite as classy but irresistible is Roy Rogers, the
ever-popular singing cowboy featured on a double bill that includes
"Trigger, Jr." (1950), a potboiler directed by William Witney, a
prolific filmmaker lately championed by Quentin Tarantino and others.</TE>
<TE>   Better still is the other Rogers picture, "Under Western Stars"
(1938). Rogers only got the role after Gene Autry went on strike
against Republic Pictures, and Rogers made the most of the
opportunity. With the cleanest shirt west of the Pecos and a clear,
lyrical tenor, the lithe and handsome Rogers got to ride hard and
sing the mournful "Dust," a song co-written by Autry that Peter
Stanfield, author of "Horse Opera: The Strange History of the 1930s
Singing Cowboy," calls "easily equal to any written by the great Dust
Bowl balladeer Woody Guthrie."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Under Western Stars," with its hostility to the
privately owned Great Western Power and Water Co. and its insistence
that government ownership of utilities was the answer to the West's
economic woes, is something unseen for decades, the kind of
progressive, socially conscious western that Ralph Nader might have
enjoyed as a boy. Chalk up getting it on the screen one more time as
yet another victory for UCLA, the archive that always gets its man.
Even the ones who sing.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film preservation is a growth industry these days, with the UCLA Film
and Television Archive far from alone in restoring and preserving
fiction and nonfiction films.</LD>
<LD>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Academy Film
Archive collection of 15,000 titles includes films from the early
days of motion pictures, documentaries and Oscar-winning and
nominated films. The archive also collaborated with 20th Century Fox
to restore the Oscar-winning 1933 film "Cavalcade" and is working on
restoring the first best picture winner, "Wings" (1927).</LD>
<LD>   In 1984, the American Film Institute established the National
Center for Film and Video Preservation, which acquires film and
television product for the AFI Collections at the Library of Congress
and other archives. The center recently restored the earliest
complete surviving copy of the 1912 adaptation of Shakespeare's
"Richard III."</LD>
<TE>   The movie studios are also involved in restoring their films.
Sony, for example, recently restored Richard Brooks' Oscar-nominated
1967 adaptation of Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood" and "Funny Girl"
(1968), which introduced Barbra Streisand to motion pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these restored films are being released in digital format.
Among some of the must-haves for films fans:</TE>
<TE>   "Rashomon" (Criterion Collection, $40): Akira Kurosawa's 1950
Japanese classic starring Toshiro Mifune features a high-definition
transfer with restored image and a video introduction by Robert
Altman.</TE>
<TE>   "Children of Paradise" (Criterion Collection, $40): The 1945
Jacques Prevert-Marcel Carne French epic went through a major
restoration in 1991. Criterion made an additional 30,000 digital
corrections to remove dirt and other problems with the negative.</TE>
<TE>   "Citizen Kane" (Warner Bros., $30): The original negative of Orson
Welles' 1941 drama had been destroyed in a fire, so the Warner Bros.
restoration team sought out the best existing prints to construct a
new print for the DVD.</TE>
<TE>   "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (Disney, $30): The first
full-length animated feature, from 1937, has been digitally restored
to its Technicolor glory for this two-disc set. Also included are
commentaries, games, newsreel footage and animation concepts.</TE>
<TE>   "Grand Illusion" (Criterion, $40): Jean Renoir's 1937 antiwar
classic--the first foreign film to be nominated for a best film
Oscar--was digitally restored from the original camera negative,
which was thought destroyed in a Paris air raid in 1942. Recently,
the negative was found unlabeled on a shelf at the cinematheque in
Toulouse, France. The disc includes several examples of how the film
was restored.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawrence of Arabia" (Columbia TriStar, $40): The beautifully
restored version of David Lean's multi-Oscar-winning 1962 epic about
the controversial Englishman T.E. Lawrence includes a comprehensive
documentary on the making of the movie that starred Peter O'Toole and
Omar Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   "Rebecca" (Criterion, $40): This is a new digital transfer with
film and sound restoration of the 1940 Alfred Hitchcock Oscar-winner
starring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier. It features commentary
from film scholar Leonard J. Leff, and screen tests of several
actresses who auditioned for the lead role.</TE>
<TE>   "Lost Horizon" (Columbia TriStar, $28): The UCLA Film and
Television Archive meticulously restored Frank Capra's 1937
adaptation of James Hilton's fantasy. The DVD includes before and
after restoration comparisons, commentary by Charles Champlin and
archivist Robert Gitt, and an alternate ending with narration.</TE>
<TE>   "Touch of Evil" (Universal, $30): Orson Welles' gritty film noir
was cut to shreds by Universal when it was released in 1958. Forty
years later, the cult flick was reedited and restored using the
director's 58-page memo to the studio with detailed editing
instructions. The disc includes a making-of documentary.</TE>
<TE>   "Vertigo" (Universal, $30): Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz
restored Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 haunting tale of obsession starring
Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak. This DVD features a new documentary and
commentary from the restoration team.</TE>

<DH>Teaching kids first to love music helps when formal
instrument lessons begin later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENDA REES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years ago when the "Mozart Effect" emerged as the latest craze to
increase intelligence in babies and young children, parents started
positioning CD players with classical music next to cribs in order to
give their toddlers a step up on the intelligence ladder.</LD>
<LD>   And while researchers still argue over the actual effect music has
on children, you don't have to be a scientist to know that music can
calm crying babies, energize tired children and delight youngsters.
Just listening to music is a stimulating experience.</LD>
<LD>   But many parents want their kids to have more than just an
appreciation of music. Playing music, they say, gives their children
self-esteem, helps them learn about the world and teaches them
patience and determination.</LD>
<TE>   "Learning music helps kids with their cognitive growth. They need
music just like any other school subject," says Debbie Naggy, mother
of three children who study music. "Plus, it's a beautiful thing to
learn that they will have with them for the rest of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Naggy started her children on their own music programs when they
were 4 and 5 years old, which is just the right age, according to
teachers. Young kids are more open to playing and experimenting with
music; their hearing is more sensitive and they aren't afraid of
making mistakes. It's a good age to instill good playing habits.</TE>
<TE>   At Music Rhapsody School, which has several Southland locations
and is one of the area's oldest early-childhood music programs,
little tykes are introduced to the rhythm and beat by dancing and
moving to myriad percussion sounds. Working with drumming
manufacturer Remo, Music Rhapsody uses percussion instruments--such
as marimbas, glockenspiels and drums--that are specially designed for
young hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many parents think music means formal lessons," says Music
Rhapsody owner Lynn Kleiner. "But children first need to be able to
understand the music and love it. Timing is the basis of good
musicianship."</TE>
<TE>   Many parents encourage their kids to "find the beat" at weekly
drum circles sponsored by the Remo Percussion Center of North
Hollywood. People of all ages--including many families with children
and toddlers--come to whack, pound and experiment.</TE>
<TE>   With exotic rhythms pulsing around them, kids excitedly rush to
the shelves lined with tambourines, timbales and congas. Along with
senior citizens and young adults, kids find a fun, creative
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Eight-year-old Sophie Brady comes regularly to the drum circle
with her mother. "You're not afraid to play and you don't get stage
fright," she says. "[Drumming] makes everyone so happy."</TE>
<TE>   Once those little ones are hooked on music, parents can face a
dizzying array of formal choices. Piano or violin? Group or
individual lessons? Suzuki method or Yamaha? Finding an appropriate
program or teacher is half the journey (see sidebar). The other half
may be realizing that a child's music education demands heaping doses
of parent participation.</TE>
<TE>   Some programs require parents to take lessons alongside the child,
especially if the student is very young. Parental support can take
many forms, but music teachers agree that parents hold the key to
their child's success.</TE>
<TE>   "Music takes time--it's not a microwave program," says Kimiko
Fujita, owner of the Torrance Yamaha Music Center. "We need patient
parents who don't push, but encourage and compliment. We need them to
not give up even when the student might feel like it."</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Cadow, music teacher at the Colburn School of Performing
Arts in downtown L.A., enjoys hearing the creative things parents do
to stay active in their child's music education. One mom combined her
son's two loves--music and baseball. "For every 10 minutes he
practiced, she would go out and throw the baseball to him for 10
minutes," says Cadow. "It was ingenious."</TE>
<TE>   "Parents need to show their enthusiasm for their child's
instrument," continues Cadow. "Sit and listen while they practice.
Don't criticize. Be their biggest fan."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Cadow says, be consistent with lessons and practice
time.</TE>
<TE>   "If a child is struggling with an instrument or a lesson, 99% of
the time it's because of a lack of consistent practice," says Cadow,
who's been teaching for 14 years. "It doesn't matter if it's 10
minutes or 30 minutes or 2 minutes. Every day they have to do it, and
soon, once they see their progress, they will get excited and want to
do it more. Success fires them up. It's the 'I did it!' factor."</TE>
<TE>   But once kids reach their teenage years, keeping that spark alive
can be problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Kerin's two children have been studying at the Pasadena
Conservatory of Music for the past 10 years. Her kids used to be
thrilled with lessons, but now outside activities have caught their
attention and threaten practice time. "With my daughter, we switched
instruments from piano to cello, and that has rejuvenated her," Kerin
says. Good teachers also understand the teenage mentality, she says,
and will appropriately restructure lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "My son is sometimes reluctant to go to lessons, but once I get
him there, he has a great time," explains Kerin, a single mom. "His
teacher is such a father figure. I think about all the good friends
and experiences my children have had because of music. It's worth all
the ups and downs."</TE>
<TE>   Another way to rekindle teens' musical passions is to introduce
new forms, like jazz. "When students get bit by the jazz bug, they
get the passion to compose and demonstrate what they can do with
their instruments," says Shelly Berg, professor and chair of jazz
studies at USC's Thornton School of Music. "Music becomes exciting
all over again."</TE>
<TE>   Berg contends that junior high school years are a good time to
expose students to jazz because the older they get, the more
inhibited they are. "You want them to be feeling free with music," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Berg remembers when his father took him to a jazz concert when he
was 11. "It was amazing; it changed my life," he says. "Parents need
to be proactive with music and make it part of their value system.
Play music around the house and take them to concerts. Expose them to
all kinds of music. Love it and they will too."</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>
<HD>Actress Thora Birch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Bregman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* The 20-year-old starred in "Ghost World," for which she received a
Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a musical or comedy. She
also starred in "American Beauty."</LD>
<LD>   Strolling: I like people-watching, so I usually walk a lot. I have
an office in West Hollywood, which is central to everything I need. I
walk to the library on San Vicente or to La Conversation at Doheny
and Santa Monica, which is a good place for a meeting. It's this
little European sort-of-wannabe French coffee place, and they've got
good coffee there, and it's like a nice little bakery too. Well, if
you like that sort of thing. They've got the classic European fare
like eclairs, scones, pastries, Danishes and lots of fancy and
gourmet-ish stuff.</LD>
<LD>   Are You Going to Buy That?: Book Soup on Sunset is definitely my
favorite bookstore. I can order or find anything I need there.
Sometimes I will go there just to read and not buy anything. There's
just so much information in there that if I have to look something up
and I don't have the perfect desk reference, then I can go and look
there. I also have gotten the best photography books from there.</LD>
<TE>   Vegan Pie: I like Real Food Daily on La Cienega. I love their Yin
Yang Salad. It comes with tofu, and it's really good. It's got that
Asian ginger-peanut dressing. I also like their coconut cream pie,
which is amazing and totally vegan. You can eradicate the guilt by
saying, "Oh, it's totally vegan. It's healthy."</TE>
<TE>   No Longer $2.75: I love the new Laemmle's Fairfax Cinemas on
Beverly and Fairfax. It's funny in there, because it still feels kind
of seedy and low-rent, but it's got this grandeur to it as well. It's
a very bizarre theater. It's still pretty red-light. That's why I
like it so much. And the seats aren't even that comfortable. When I
went and saw "Y Tu Mama Tambien" there, the crowd was a lovely mix of
Mexicans and single middle-class males.</TE>
<TE>   Close but So Far: I like to walk around the lower hills just west
of Doheny looking at the houses and just hoping. I also like walking
south of Sunset in the Bundy area. It's really pretty there. I also
like walking on the beach, but I rarely ever get there. It's weird
how you can live so close to the ocean and yet never see it. Though I
like the idea of it and when I have to go there I love it. I'm like,
"I should come here more often. It's so lovely." But I never do.</TE>
<TE>   Euro-Deli: There's this place called Shoops on Main Street in
Santa Monica and it's this great little European deli and cafe, but
their coffee is really good too, and you can find all kinds of
different noodles, flour and chocolate. They have everything from
Europe that you have ever liked or thought, "Wow. If we only had this
in L.A."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest offering from the Circle X Theatre Company, "Laura
Comstock's Bag-Punching Dog," a world-premiere musical now at the
24th Street Theatre, is the ground-floor production of what could
well be a theatrical event. Despite a shaky vocal performance or two
and a few rough patches in thematic cohesion, this consummately
well-realized entertainment is a technical knockout with Broadway
potential.</LD>
<LD>   Written and conceived by Jillian Armenante and Alice Dodd, who
also co-wrote Circle X's smash Gothic spoof, "In Flagrante Gothicto,"
the play offers a sweeping overview of the earliest days of the film
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the most famous historical figure here, Thomas A. Edison
(Christopher Carroll), emerges as a conscienceless huckster who
specializes in preempting the innovations of others. But then, by
this account, hucksters abounded among early cinematic innovators,
depicted here as a slapstick aggregation of schemers, dreamers and
downright charlatans.</LD>
<TE>   The most serious plot element derives from the mysterious
disappearance of one of the earliest innovators and the subsequent
murder of his son, both unsolved mysteries to this day. The
circumstances surrounding these long-ago events were certainly
suspicious, but Dodd and Armenante don't quite make the case for a
full-blown conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Left in sharpest focus at play's end is the unjustly neglected
Alice Guy (Dodd), a brilliant female film director and innovator who,
by the end of her long life, had been so completely expunged from the
annals that not a single newspaper carried her obituary--a telling
and disheartening omission.</TE>
<TE>   It all makes for a captivating melange, by turns riotous and
heartbreaking. Chris Jeffries' wonderful score (Dodd and Armenante
contributed additional lyrics) ranges from the toe-tapping to the
elegiac. The design elements--Kathi O'Donohue's lighting, Gary
Smoot's set, Paul Spadone's costumes and Tim Labor's sound--are
flawlessly rendered. Musical director Paul Hepker keeps the sound
crisp and professional. Choreographer Gerry McIntyre contributes
whimsical dance sequences.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding over this dizzying blend is Armenante, who also designed
the production's fascinating archival film footage. As director of
this alternately cheeky and profound production, Armenante is
masterful--a visionary innovator in her own right.</TE>

<LD>Leading a group of nominees who reflect the global sweep and
stylistic variety of Latin music, Colombia's Carlos Vives received
six nominations for the third annual Latin Grammy Awards Wednesday,
including best album, record and song of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The long-haired, hippie-looking singer-songwriter, who turned the
folksy vallenato style of his native land into an international rage
in the Latin music world, was honored for his latest album, "Dejame
Entrar," and its title cut, an inviting pop love song that has
brought him renewed commercial success. Vives also earned nominations
for best tropical song, best music video and best contemporary
tropical album, one of two new categories added this year to the
competition.</LD>
<LD>   Veteran Cuban singer Celia Cruz was the second-most-honored
nominee, named in four categories, including album and record of the
year for "El Negro Tiene Tumbao." The lively album, which bestowed a
contemporary patina on the grand dame of salsa, defies the current
slump in the genre's sales, not to mention artistic vision. Cruz's
album was co-produced by Johnny Pacheco, the Dominican bandleader
whose collaborations with Cruz in the 1970s are milestones. Pacheco
shares the best album nomination with co-producers Sergio George and
Isidro Infante.</LD>
<TE>   The two artists who swept last year's nominations--romantic
Spanish heartthrob Alejandro Sanz and progressive pop-rock Colombian
singer-songwriter Juanes--were back this year with three nominations
each, including best song. Other top nominees announced Wednesday by
the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences--with three
nominations each--are veteran singer Miguel Bose of Spain and
newcomer Gian Marco from Peru. Powerful Cuban American producer
Emilio Estefan Jr. also earned three nominations in the album and
record of the year categories for his work on the Vives and Gian
Marco records.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the best record category is Chile's pioneering rock
en espanol outfit La Ley, for "Mentira," from its "MTV Unplugged"
album. The remaining nominee in the best album category is Brazil's
Ivan Lins for "Jobiniando," a tribute to Antonio Carlos Jobim,
produced by Roberto Menescal.</TE>
<TE>   "What the nominations demonstrate is the dynamic nature of Latin
music, which continues to renew itself very rapidly," Enrique
Fernandez, head of the Latin Recording Academy, said following the
announcement of the nominees at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   In its splashy but turbulent history, the Latin Grammys have
quickly become the leading international showcase for Latin music,
honoring artists and technical recording professionals whose work is
primarily in Spanish or Portuguese. Unlike the original Grammy
Awards, which focus on domestic U.S. releases, entries for the Latin
Grammys come from nearly a dozen Iberian and Latin American nations.</TE>
<TE>   This year's awards are scheduled to be presented Sept. 18 at the
Kodak Theatre in Hollywood and televised nationally on CBS. Awards
will be handed out in 41 categories, from pop and rock to folk, jazz,
Brazilian and classical.</TE>
<TE>   Although this year's nominations underscored the international
diversity of the Latin music scene, Colombia continued to prove
itself a musical powerhouse. Four nominees from the war-torn
country--Vives, Juanes, Cabas and Shakira--accumulated a total of 11
nominations among them. Andres Cabas, a brash singer-songwriter who
goes only by his last name, was nominated for his self-titled debut
album, a stunning and innovative fusion of cumbia and rock laced with
sharp social observation.</TE>
<TE>   This marks the second year in a row that a previously unknown
Colombian artist has attracted attention with a nomination in the new
artist category. Though not nearly as regaled as Juanes, who had
seven nominations last year, Cabas now has the opportunity to follow
in the footsteps of his folk-rock predecessor, who became an instant
international star after winning the most nominations in the second
awards competition.</TE>
<TE>   Even Shakira, the Colombian crossover diva whose hit album does
not qualify because it's primarily in English, was nominated in the
best video category for "Suerte," the Spanish version of "Whenever,
Wherever."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy for Colombia, because we continue to emerge and
demonstrate a positive side to our country," said Juanes, who this
year competes only with his uplifting single, "A Dios Le Pido." It's
a cut from his new album, "Un Dia Normal," which was released too
late to qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Vives, Cuban artists Sintesis and Vocal Sampling
garnered nominations in the new contemporary tropical category,
rounded out by Celso Pina and Felix D'Oleo.</TE>
<TE>   (Records released between April 1, 2001, and March 31, 2002, were
eligible for the awards, which will be voted on by the approximately
2,800 voting members of the Latin academy.)</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the main Grammy Awards, which were long criticized for
ignoring significant new talent such as Elvis Presley in the '50s and
Bob Dylan in the '60s, the Latin Grammys have quickly become a
credible vehicle for breaking emerging stars from Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Yet from the start, the Latin Grammys have been marked by
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Their debut in 2000 drew a boycott by the L.A.-based record label
Fonovisa, which accused the awards show of snubbing Mexican regional
music in favor of East Coast styles represented by Estefan's
Miami-based production company. This year, Fonovisa artists garnered
a total of eight nominations in the six regional categories.</TE>
<TE>   Latin Grammy organizers had barely healed the initial rifts when
controversy engulfed the event again last year.</TE>
<TE>   Planned protests by anti-communist Cuban exiles forced a
last-minute move of the awards show from Miami to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But the awards were canceled after the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11, the day of the scheduled show.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, the stranded nominees and their guests held one
of the first musical benefits for disaster relief, a simple but
moving performance called "Concierto Para Los Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Last year's awards eventually were handed out on Oct. 30 during a
low-key press conference at the Conga Room.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco singer Kitty Margolis made her Los Angeles club debut
at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Tuesday night. And the first thought that
came to mind during her exhilarating set was to wonder why in the
world it hadn't happened sooner. Yes, Margolis has previously
appeared in various concert venues around the Southland, but never
before, she reported, in a traditional jazz nightclub setting.</LD>
<LD>   Better late than never, as it turned out, even if it was only a
one-nighter. The current rush toward the signing of new, young,
female jazz vocalists is tending to obscure the importance of
musicality, inventiveness and experience. Margolis, 46, offered a
performance that was a brilliant reminder of the great pleasures of
jazz singing when it is delivered by a mature, gifted, creative
artist.</LD>
<LD>   Her set dispensed multileveled layers of pleasure. There was,
first of all, the sheer sense of joy in performing that was a
palpable presence in everything she did. Completely centered,
completely in the moment, Margolis' total involvement in the
enjoyment of making music reached out to embrace her players--pianist
Michael Bluestein, bassist Tom Warrington and drummer Paul
Kreibich--as well as her enthusiastic listeners.</LD>
<TE>   A firm believer in the notion that entertainment and artistry can
be completely compatible with one another, she proved that premise in
one number after another. Opening with a burningly fast, up-tempo
romp through "I Want to Be Happy," she immediately displayed her
vocal virtuosity, punching out inventive variations on the song's
basic theme.</TE>
<TE>   Pausing between numbers, she took a moment to eloquently introduce
Percy Mayfield's "Please Send Me Someone to Love," stressing the
value of its message in the context of the past year's disturbing
events, singing the classic tune with passionately engaging
intensity.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting into ballad mode, Margolis' version of "You Don't Know
What Love Is" was climaxed by an extraordinary closing cadenza in
which her melismatic vocal lines slid dramatically in and out of the
dissonant parts of the underlying harmony.</TE>
<TE>   Other songs--"We Kiss in a Shadow," "Summertime," "Spring Will Be
a Little Late This Year" and "My Favorite Things"--were filled with
equally inventive moments, tempered by her witty sense of humor and
high-spirited stage presence.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying and enhancing all her other extraordinary qualities,
there was Margolis' sophisticated musicality--an ear for harmony, an
improvisational imagination and a buoyant sense of rhythmic swing
that place her at the very top level of the jazz vocal art.</TE>
<TE>   And one could only hope that the current emphasis upon youth and
its demographic appeal will not completely overshadow the work of
such a vital and valuable artist.</TE>

<HD>Lauren Ambrose: Youthful Maturity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the greatest moments in Lauren Ambrose's young life took place
two years ago at the Slamdance Film Festival screening of "Swimming,"
an intimate coming-of-age drama in which she plays a young woman
adrift but trying to find her place in the world.</LD>
<LD>   "It was the first time I had seen it," recalls Ambrose, who also
plays the artistic but troubled teen Claire on HBO's drama series
"Six Feet Under."</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody was so excited to see this movie, and people asked so
many questions about the film and were so moved by the film," says
Ambrose. "Everybody had a sense that something was going on--there
was a real energy in that room. Everyone had a passion for
filmmaking."</LD>
<TE>   After playing the festival circuit for more than a year,
"Swimming" has been slowly rolling out in theaters across America. It
has played three months in Boston, two months in Dallas and arrives
for a one-week run in Los Angeles this Friday--a week after Ambrose
was nominated for a supporting actress Emmy for "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   The pale, red-haired actress dominates the low-budget indie film
as Frankie Wheeler, a rather plain Jane who operates a cafe with her
brother in the North Carolina resort of Myrtle Beach. The film
focuses on one pivotal summer when Frankie's mundane life is turned
on its ear with the arrival in town of a beautiful young woman who
becomes a waitress in the cafe and a drifter who lives in a van with
his two dogs.</TE>
<TE>   When director Robert J. Siegel saw Ambrose in the waiting room
before the audition, he knew she was his Frankie. "As a smart actor,
she dressed for the role," he recalls. "She had some baggy shorts
that made her look less like Lauren Ambrose and more like Frankie
Wheeler. It was her face and her eyes, which immediately take her
inside of you. You get this gut feeling sometimes; nobody even came
close to Lauren."</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of went for it," says Ambrose, during a recent lunch at a
quaint greasy spoon in Benedict Canyon. Ambrose, 23, is friendly but
reserved as she picks at her grilled cheese sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   Playing Frankie, she says, was "really an interesting" exercise
and a "new venture for me to play a character that is practically in
every frame of the film and has the least amount of dialogue. It's
really cool to figure out a way to make the character real without
the aid of words. It's a very subtle film."</TE>
<TE>   Being simpatico with director Siegel helped. "He had an idea of
the kind of movie he wanted to make, not any explosions or any big
changes in the character. It's sort of a miracle to see if it will
all jibe and see if the director's vision will be there and if the
actor is doing what is appropriate for the scene."</TE>
<TE>   As far as Siegel is concerned, Ambrose rose to the occasion. "She
had done wonderfully before in films," says Siegel, "but they were
ensemble pieces, and here she faced being a star. She had to
internalize to express her inner life without being able to
articulate it into words. She frumped herself up. A lot of
up-and-coming young stars would be very concerned about doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose didn't dress up for her audition for "Six Feet Under" but,
according to executive producer Alan Poul, she lighted up the room.
Poul and series creator and executive producer Alan Ball ("American
Beauty") had a hard time casting the role of Claire, the tormented
but vulnerable youngest child of a dysfunctional family that owns an
L.A. mortuary. At the end of last season, Claire, who drives a green
hearse, didn't know if she had been accepted at an arts college in
Los Angeles or if she would be forced to attend a community college.</TE>
<TE>   "Claire was one of the most difficult roles to cast because on
paper, if you read the pilot, it is such an unusual character, such
an edgy character," says Poul. "Finding someone who had the
combination of genuine edge and, when necessary, hostility but also
was deeply vulnerable, and it was truly difficult. It's very taxing
for a young actor to do something that complex."</TE>
<TE>   Ball and Poul eventually narrowed their choices to three,
including Ambrose, and presented them to HBO brass. "She is so
fearless," says Poul. "She filled the room. I think that was the
moment we saw her limitless capability. It was one of those moments
of absolute clarity."</TE>
<TE>   "I work well under pressure," Ambrose says. "I read the script and
thought it was wonderful, and having Alan Ball's name on the front
page, I wanted to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   That the series has become one of the most popular on the cable
outlet and received 23 Emmy nominations last week, including one for
Ambrose, took the actress by surprise. "It's really struck a chord,"
she says. "It's really flattering. I get to act every day and am
surrounded by really creative people, especially the actors in the
show. You make a little film every week. It's an intense shooting
schedule. We made an episode in nine days and it's a very dense
hour."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose, says Poul, made a major contribution in the development
of her character. "We can take her anywhere," he says. "Lauren has
been working for a while and she has a great deal of experience for
someone her age. I see a lot of young actors working without a
rudder. She has a great deal of wisdom. She has a very secure
knowledge of her own gifts, and she understands what works for her
and what doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Although she's made her mark playing angst-ridden teenagers,
Ambrose seems to have known at a very young age what she wanted to do
with her life. Born and raised in New Haven, Conn., she discovered
she had a voice as a youngster and trained as an opera singer.
"That's how I found performing and acting," she says, taking another
bite out of her sandwich. "I went to Catholic school, and there was
always singing going on."</TE>
<TE>   At 14, she told her parents she wanted to act professionally. "I
can't remember how it worked," she says. "I had an agent send me out.
It was very low-key during the summers. I did episodes of 'Law &amp;
Order' during the summer vacation, and that was sort of my
introduction to it. After that, I decided to go for it and see what
happened. I started working pretty consistently."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose's acting career has been so hectic that she didn't have
much time to sing. But this summer, she has made the time. "Maybe it
will be another career one day," she says.</TE>

<LD>   Assassins--The controversial Stephen Sondheim-John Weidman musical
about the killers of U.S. presidents is a tough sell under any
circumstances. Tackling it in a period of surging patriotism is a
particularly gutsy gamble, but Karesa McElheny's accomplished staging
redeems the show's problematic reputation. The piece freely mixes
fantasy and reality to unearth a common underlying theme in these
nine successful and would-be presidential assassins: the corruption
of the right to the pursuit of happiness. This manifests itself in
different ways, from the misguided patriotic zealotry of John Wilkes
Booth (Beau Puckett) to the loony ravings of would-be airline
hijacker Samuel Byck (Jeffrey Cabot Myers). Though the brevity of the
show's initial New York run was often blamed on bad timing, another
obstacle was its lack of any opening for empathy. That problem was
solved with the addition of "Something Just Broke" (not on the
original cast recording, but here), a heartbreaking number in which
ordinary people sing of their reactions to the JFK shooting. The song
transforms a freak show into a moving collective experience of
national grief.</LD>

<HD>A Tactful Jackson Connects</HD>
<DH>The country star gracefully segues from earlier songs to
his wildly popular 'Where Were You,' inspired by Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How you gonna keep 'em down on the Chattahoochee after they've seen
ground zero?</LD>
<LD>   Alan Jackson faced that question on two fronts Tuesday at the
Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, where he played his first Southland
concert since he transcended mere country music stardom with his
Sept. 11-inspired hit "Where Were You (When the World Stopped
Turning)."</LD>
<LD>   As the genial singer of such lighthearted, and often lightweight
numbers as "Chattahoochee" and "Gone Country," the lanky Georgian
could have come across as flippant, or worse, irrelevant if his
pre-"Where Were You" material weren't handled tactfully.</LD>
<TE>   But as his 90-minute show led up to his masterfully constructed
response to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
those earlier songs subtly served to underscore the big importance of
life's little moments.</TE>
<TE>   A few gained resonance, most notably his first hit, "Here in the
Real World," in which he contrasts a world as we might like it to
be--where "cowboys don't cry, heroes don't die, and good always
wins"--with the one we live in.</TE>
<TE>   The graceful segue from the standard part of the show into the
climactic "Where Were You" employed a video montage of Orange County
locales projected during "Where I Come From," ending with a close-up
of a shoulder patch worn by an Anaheim firefighter saluting his New
York counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   As frequently as "Where Were You" has been played on the radio,
its string of questions with no easy answers has lost none of its
cumulative power nine months down the line. The audience responded
with a deafening roar in a moment of shared grief and enduring hope.</TE>
<TE>   But that set up Jackson's second dilemma: How do you follow that
moment? He might have chosen not to try at all, or, if an encore was
essential, to select a gospel number as spiritual salve to the open
emotional wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he returned with a rocker, "Mercury Blues," presumably as
a way to end the evening on an upbeat note. But by engaging in a
lengthy autograph-signing session as the band played on and on, he
unintentionally let celebrity overshadow the lingering impact of a
national tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Trisha Yearwood opened with an hourlong set spanning her 11-year
career, and showcasing her great knack for picking songs that expose
real emotion rather than push easy buttons.</TE>

<LD>When actors master Shakespeare, the text becomes a symphony of
rhythms and textures, conveying rich and varied meaning. When
Shakespeare masters the actors, however, you've got a problem.</LD>
<LD>   Sorry to say, the second scenario is playing out in the Long Beach
Shakespeare Company's presentation of "Love's Labour's Lost," as
hard-working but under-skilled actors get lost in the verbal thickets
of one of the Bard's most challenging texts.</LD>
<LD>   The intentions are good. This free outdoor production in Stearns
Park is meant to reach out to the community, and the 16
performers--who range from a high school student to a lone member of
the Actors' Equity stage union--reflect the area's diversity more
comprehensively than many other productions. Although mostly young,
these actors bring a variety of cultural and life experiences to the
stage.</LD>
<TE>   The text has them stymied, though.</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare used in-jokes and a lot of over-elaborate language to
skewer the manners of certain intellectuals in 1590s England. To most
of the performers, the words are like a foreign language, spoken by
rote with little nuance. Others have begun to find color in the text
but fall into galloping, repetitive rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   The Elizabethan-dress staging--by company artistic director Helen
Borgers--is likewise dull, with little variation or artistry in the
actors' movement or placement.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shakespeare's message--that life is a classroom and people
are the books--filters through.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Weber and Angie Paul gamely engage in the romantic sparring
between Berowne, who reluctantly joins his king in forswearing
revelry and women's company so that they can focus on high-minded
study, and Rosaline, one of the beguiling women who immediately put
the men's principles to the test.</TE>
<TE>   As a couple of rustic characters at the edges of the action, Jim
Belisle and Liz Hurwitz are comic free spirits. And as the zany
Spaniard Armado, Benito Borjas Jr. looks like an El Greco painting
come crazily to life.</TE>

<LD>* Solomon Burke, "Don't Give Up on Me," Fat Possum. Burke, one of the
all-time great soul singers, had been off the pop radar screen for a
few decades until last year, when he was inducted into the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame. This collection of songs written for Burke also
includes contributions by such respected writers as Bob Dylan, Van
Morrison, Tom Waits and Elvis Costello. The tunes range from
plaintive and winsome to philosophical, and Burke's spectacular voice
updates the intensity and desire of soul's golden age.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: Sex and Britney Spears go together like the little
bubbles in Coca-Cola. One ingredient sells the other. That said,
"Crossroads" is no "Glitter." Spears acquits herself as well as
anyone might in a movie as contrived and lazy as this one. She has a
natural screen presence and, despite all those irritating vocal tics,
makes herself likable. This may come as a shock, but she's OK. This
is one of those thankless projects that directors usually take on so
they can do something else. Tamra Davis ("Guncrazy," "CB4") is
capable of much better than this, but perhaps the idea was just to
get out of Spears' way. At the same time, of course, you're just
happy she isn't Mariah Carey.</LD>

<DH>Bryan Small keeps the Hangmen going through personal
travails and major-label abandonment</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way some people have been talking recently about the return of
good old-fashioned rock 'n' roll, you'd think it actually went away
or something. But in truth, as veteran Hollywood rock band the
Hangmen noted while touring the Midwest recently with Social
Distortion, rock never really disappears.</LD>
<LD>   "When you go to Middle America, rock 'n' roll is all that
matters," says Hangmen guitarist Jimmy James. "People are just so
stoked to hear it."</LD>
<LD>   And, despite a checkered decade-plus history, the Hangmen are
still stoked to play it. Just listen to the quartet rip on its
forthcoming live album, "We've Got Blood on the Toes of Our Boots,"
due Aug. 6 on Santa Monica-based indie Acetate Records.</LD>
<TE>   The band, which will play the Knitting Factory in Hollywood on
Aug. 10, burns through its bluesy, punk-flavored,
slide-guitar-drenched tales of street-level love and woe with a fire
that offers no hint of the major-label travails and personal problems
of leader Bryan Small, the only original member left.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the band's story is often cited as a cautionary tale for
starry-eyed wannabes seeking fame in Hollywood. Yet it's also a
reminder that rock 'n' roll isn't just a route to renown or a
soundtrack for selling stuff, but an irresistible life calling that
can be, by turns, destructive and exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I don't have a choice," Small says, laughing a little,
sitting with other band members in his east Hollywood-area apartment.
"Even if I tried to stop doing this, I would still be doing it in
some way."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the raw sounds of such L.A. idols as the Gun Club and
X, Montana-born Small formed the Hangmen after moving here from
Boise, Idaho, in 1984. The band released its debut album on Capitol
Records in 1989, but its straightforward,
Stones-and-Stooges-influenced sound (especially in the watered-down
state rendered on the recording) wasn't an easy sell in the
hair-metal era before grunge, and the Hangmen were soon dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Small and a new lineup were signed to Geffen Records, but a second
album was permanently shelved in 1992 and the singer-guitarist
descended into a pit of addiction, family concerns and professional
soul-searching. All the while, he tenaciously kept the band alive, or
at least firmly on life support.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Small cleaned up and refocused, recruiting yet another
new lineup that was finalized early last year. It consists of James,
bassist Angelique Congleton and drummer Todd Haney. Eleven years
after the Hangmen's debut, Small exorcised many of his old demons on
2000's "Metallic I.O.U.," an Acetate release that garnered praise
locally and around the world. An ensuing tour brought the band back
into the underground spotlight, as younger acts such as the
Supersuckers and Vancouver glam-punks the Black Halos related how the
Hangmen had influenced them.</TE>
<TE>   To Small's bandmates, such praise affirmed their own admiration
for his songwriting. "The songs always rise above," says Haney.
"That's why Tom Petty's been around this long, and Bob Dylan, because
they keep writing great songs."</TE>
<TE>   The live album often reflects an affinity for Petty's
unpretentious, melodic blend of rock, blues, country and pop, and the
players aren't joking when they say they'd love to open for Petty's
tour this summer. "I read something about Petty saying that so much
music today makes him want to drink light beer," says James with a
laugh. "That was so on the money."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, rather than getting excited by any possibility that the
current pop climate could bring the band commercial success at last,
Small more relishes his own personal victories in bringing the
Hangmen back to life. "I just want to see things progress like
they've been progressing," he says. "Every time we turn around, more
things are [happening]. It seems way more real this time," he adds.
"But nothing's being handed to us. We've worked really hard, and
we're gonna continue to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many sadder-but-wiser veterans of the major-label
merry-go-round, he's happy with his indie status. "I've been through
enough that I'm not gonna ignore the business end of it anymore, like
I did," he says. "But I kind of know who to trust these days."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Small hasn't closed the door on the better parts of his past.
One reason the players followed up "Metallic I.O.U." with a live
recording instead of another studio album was because they could
revisit the Hangmen's fine older material, some of which was never
recorded. So they invited a bunch of friends to hear a couple of sets
at Swinghouse Studios in Hollywood, which has hosted such rock
luminaries as X, Iggy Pop and the Breeders.</TE>
<TE>   "We still like to play these songs live, but people didn't know
where to get them," Small explains. "A lot of them have been out of
print." Indeed, the Hangmen's debut album still pops up on EBay,
where it usually sells for $25 to $40.</TE>
<TE>   One can imagine a thirtysomething fan bidding on a favorite piece
of nostalgia, but the players have learned from touring experiences
that the Hangmen's music also resonates with a new generation. "I got
the feeling sometimes that a lot of the young punk kids were
surprised they liked us," says Congleton, who, at 31, was the only
band member willing to reveal her age.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what made it cool," adds James. "It made you think they
were gonna run out and buy a guitar and start their own band. And it
all kind of recycles from there."</TE>

<LD>Moomba Files for Chapter 11: It was only a year and a half ago that
the New York hot spot Moomba opened a West Hollywood outpost. With
its overflowing bar, red dining rooms, wraparound patio,
entertainment space and private downstairs room, Moomba quickly
became a watering hole for the young Hollywood set. But according to
owner Jeff Gossett, the sheer size of the sprawling, opulently
decorated space caused problems. "We were inundated with pre-opening
construction costs," he says, "and in order to relieve the pressure
and stress from the debt, we filed." Despite the bankruptcy filing,
he remains upbeat. "We're still here doing great things culinarily
wise, and have lots of interesting entertainment. It's always fun
here at Moomba," he insists.</LD>
<LD>   We have, however, noted a sharp falloff in the crowds and star
wattage in recent months.</LD>
<TE>   From Hofbrau to Falcon: If success in real estate is location,
location, location, it's sometimes more true with restaurants. Some
spots seem plagued with bad karma, while others act like magnets,
attracting hordes of people under each and every incarnation. The
legendary Fritzi's Vienna Hofbrau on Sunset Boulevard used to occupy
one of those lucky locales. Now it's morphed into a restaurant and
club called Falcon. The name is a reference to silent film star
Rudolph Valentino's old residence, which he called Falcon Lair, which
inspired the trendy decor. Partners Tommy Stoilkovich and Mike
Garrett are the brains behind Voda, Lounge 217 and Pearl Dragon,
while partner Keith McCarthy is a veteran of Jones Hollywood. A
brushed, stainless-steel wind chime curtain, ebony plank floors,
walls of zebrawood and faux alpaca fur ottomans set the scene.
Somehow the word "jungle" springs to mind. But the food from chef
Matthew Dickson is pure comfort. "My menu is dictated by what's in
season, not by what's cool," says the former Rockenwagner chef de
cuisine. Dickson is a busy guy: He not only bakes his own breads and
cures his own olives, he also makes his own pastas, sun-dried
tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. And on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
evenings the kitchen stays open until 1 a.m.</TE>

<TE>   Firefly Alights: Monique King, formally executive chef at Border
Grill and most recently owner-chef of Soul Kitchen in Chicago, has
come back home. With her husband, Paul Rosenbluh (who is also a
chef), and her father, actor Carl Weintraub, she's opened Firefly
Bistro in South Pasadena. She's replanted the outdoor restaurant with
lots of herbs, fuchsia and periwinkle hydrangea, even some
grapevines. For the summer, she's hung diaphanous curtains and
installed misting systems for cooling. King describes the menu as "a
real melting pot of cuisines" with influences from the American South
and the Caribbean as well as southern Italy, Spain and Morocco. "The
food will be a little bit bold and in your face."</TE>

<HD>Cassavetes' 'Shadows' Retains Powerful Message on Racism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the '50s gave way to the '60s, Hollywood had settled into a rather
sedate era with its carefully polished films, and although
independent cinema was burgeoning in New York in the '40s and '50s,
none of those films was quite so startling as John Cassavetes' first
feature, "Shadows." It was a raw, fresh slice of life that also
revealed the racism of the era in an understated way, far different
from the usual self-important Hollywood approach.</LD>
<LD>   "Shadows," which screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Melnitz Hall's
James Bridges Theater in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's 14th
Festival of Preservation, had an impact at the time of its release
that it is hard to convey today.</LD>
<TE>   Some self-conscious moments in "Shadows" and scenes that play like
acting-class exercises are more evident today, yet they do not
diminish the film's power or its visually poetic quality; Erich
Kollmar was Cassavetes' gifted and resourceful cameraman. It is also
a film for a time capsule, with images of Manhattan mainly at night
and a milieu that is somewhat bohemian, somewhat phony and not really
Beat, with the main character, Ben, coming closest to an actual
beatnik."Shadows" focuses on a 20-year-old beauty, Lelia (Lelia
Goldoni), an aspiring painter who shares an apartment with her
brothers Ben (Ben Carruthers), a would-be jazz trumpeter, and Hugh
(Hugh Hurd), a singer who resents strip-club bookings but seems to be
the only breadwinner. Lelia and Ben may have had a different mother
or father than Hugh, for they pass as white whereas Hugh is
unmistakably African American.</TE>
<TE>   While Hugh pursues his career steeped in frustration--and surely
must face discrimination--Lelia plies the arty party circuit and Ben,
who suffers much inner torment, hangs out with pals who drift
aimlessly. Naive and affected yet a devoted and caring sister, Lelia
meets Tony (Anthony Ray), whose unawareness of her family has painful
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular assumptions, "Shadows" was not improvised but
was scripted by Cassavetes with much input from his cast; what was
improvised was the film's great Charlie Mingus score. Goldoni and
Gena Rowlands will appear in person. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the noteworthy offerings of the Latino International Film
Festival, which concludes Sunday at the Egyptian and other venues,
Laurie Ann Schag and Casey Stoll's "Great Day in Havana" (today at
5:15 p.m. at the Egyptian's Spielberg Theater) is a splendid
documentary that features interviews with 11 important figures in the
arts, including singer Carlos Varela and actor Jorge Perugorria, star
of the acclaimed "Strawberry and Chocolate." In general, all 11 love
their country and its culture, concede that they by and large enjoy
special status and in general acknowledge a need for their society to
change.</TE>
<TE>   Usually the only movies imported to the U.S. from Brazil are art
films, so Roberto Santucci Filho's "Bellini and the Sphinx"
(Egyptian, tonight at 9:45) proves to be a departure: a well-made,
engrossing, private-eye mystery in which an investigator (Fabio
Assuncao) is assigned to locate a missing prostitute on behalf of a
rich, elderly physician. The job sends him on a steamy tour of
Brazilian lowlife and plunges him into a labyrinthine plot hinging on
family secrets reminiscent of a Ross Macdonald Lew Archer novel.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan director Alberto Arvelo's "A House With a View of the
Sea" (Egyptian, Saturday at 3 p.m.) is a bleak, overly literary
account of injustice heaped upon a peasant (Imanol Arias, a mainstay
of the Spanish-speaking cinema) by a corrupt landowner.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes Portillo's "Senorita Extraviada" (Egyptian's Spielberg
Theater, Saturday at 11:15 a.m.) documents with low-key persistence
the conditions in Ciudad Juarez that make some say, "There is no
better place in the world to kill a young woman." Since the mid-'90s
some 230 teenagers and young women have been murdered, and no one
ever seems to be brought to justice. Two key factors are that the
city is a hub from which drugs are smuggled into the U.S. and that
the implementation of the NAFTA accords has greatly accelerated its
industrialization. About 80% of the assembly factories are American
owned, and they employ 185,000 workers, mainly young women, many of
them from rural areas all over Mexico, willing to work long hours for
$4 or $5 a day, to a large extent displacing the male work force.
Thus, a large population of poor, unsophisticated young women is at
the mercy of a city in which corruption of the police and local
government is painfully obvious and in which there are many
out-of-work men.</TE>
<TE>   Ineptitude and machismo coalesce at every level of the
bureaucracy. Chillingly, Portillo informs us that 50 women were
killed in the 18 months it took her to make her film.</TE>
<TE>   Sad to say, Robert M. Young's "Alambrista!" (The Illegal)
(Egyptian, Sunday at 10:30 a.m.) is as timely as ever in its
depiction of the plight of an illegal immigrant from Mexico. Arguably
Young's most accomplished work, it follows Roberto (Domingo Ambriz)
as he bids farewell to his family in Mexico and heads to the U.S.,
confident of being able to make money to send home. Once over the
border, he begins an odyssey more harrowing than he had anticipated.
He winds up in Stockton, where he is rescued by a wistful waitress
(Linda Gillin) and begins building a new life.</TE>
<TE>   In a fictional narrative with a gritty, spontaneous naturalism,
Roberto's story convincingly becomes an act of protest in which both
Americans and Mexicans are depicted as caught up in a corrupt system.
The film is studded with remarkable moments humorous and grim, and
Ambriz and Gillin are truly touching. The only familiar faces are
those of Ned Beatty and the late Julius Harris, stalwart character
actors. By the time this powerful film is over, it is clear that a
green card is as crucial as the bicycle in Vittorio De Sica's classic
"The Bicycle Thief." (323) 469-9066.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque, in conjunction with the Museum of
Contemporary Art, presents "Andy Warhol Does Hollywood," which
commences Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Egyptian with the West Coast
premiere of "Tarzan and Jane Regained ... Sort of" (1963), which was
unavailable for preview. It will be followed by "Andy Warhol" (1972),
David Bailey's amusing 47-minute documentary. The series runs through
Aug. 28. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The weekend brings some Hollywood classics. Among the films
screening in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's "William Wyler
and the Tradition of Excellence" series is "Carrie" (1952), which
screens Friday following the 7:30 p.m. presentation of the Bette
Davis star vehicle "Jezebel" (1938), which is as well-known as
Wyler's superb film of Theodore Dreiser's "Sister Carrie" is unjustly
neglected. Scripted by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, it emerges as a
sweeping, period-perfect, ill-fated romance in which Laurence
Olivier's successful, middle-aged Chicago restaurateur throws his
life away for Jennifer Jones' naive but ambitious country girl.
"Carrie" boasts some of Jones' and Olivier's finest screen work.
(323) 857-6177.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the Art Directors Guild Film Society will pay tribute
to one of the giants of its profession, Hans Dreier (1885-1966), with
a symposium and screening of Josef von Sternberg's highly stylized
"The Scarlet Empress," starring Marlene Dietrich as Catherine the
Great and notable for the magnificence of its costumes and settings.
Film historian Beverly Heisner will moderate a panel composed of
Robert Boyle, Henry Bumstead and Al Nozaki, all of whom worked with
Dreier, a Paramount golden era mainstay, early in their own
distinguished careers. The event will be held at the Directors Guild
of America, with the symposium held at 2 p.m., followed by a
reception at 3:30 and the screening at 4. Admission is free and the
event is open to the public, but reservations are required. (818)

<HD>It's a Touch of the Taper in Ojai</HD>
<DH>Theater* Four of the five authors presenting new works at
playwrights conference have been represented in events at the
downtown facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Examining the bill of fare at this week's Ojai Playwrights
Conference, regular theatergoers may find the words "Mark Taper
Forum" creeping into their brains.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-year-old Ojai organization has a new artistic director,
Robert Egan, who also is producing director of the Taper, L.A.'s
flagship theater.</LD>
<LD>   Four of the five playwrights whose new works will be publicly read
this weekend in Ojai have also been represented by Taper productions,
public workshops or readings. One of the writers, Luis Alfaro, is on
the Taper staff as associate producer, new play development, and
co-director of the Latino Theatre Initiative.</LD>
<TE>   Three plays by another writer, Jon Robin Baitz, received Taper
main-stage productions, with a fourth scheduled for next season. Lisa
Loomer, a writer with two previous Taper main-stage productions and a
third scheduled for next year, is Ojai's writer-in-residence.</TE>
<TE>   Even the one Ojai play by a non-Taper-produced
playwright--"Discovery of America" by Arthur Kopit--was sold to Taper
subscribers as part of the 1989-90 season. But the production was
canceled before it happened, because the play wasn't ready.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very concerned that we would become the Taper, Three," said
Ojai resident Kim Maxwell-Brown--artistic director of the town's
Theater 150, one of the co-founders of the Ojai conference and a
board member. She was referring to the Taper developmental series
Taper, Too. "I didn't want it to be slick. I wanted it to stay
grass-roots."</TE>
<TE>   But Egan eventually won her over. He said there has been "no
Taperization" of the conference--he was the only Taper-affiliated
member of the play selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   The conference was initially a co-creation of L.A.'s Echo Theater
Company and Theater 150. In the first season, in 1998, the six play
readings included titles by the well-known Christopher Durang and the
soon-to-be-well-known David Lindsay-Abaire.</TE>
<TE>   After two years, the conference became an independent nonprofit.
In the third season, Jessica Goldberg's "Good Thing" was read in
Ojai; a year later, it was part of the Taper's 2001 New Work
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Echo artistic director Chris Fields was the conference artistic
director for the first three years but was then asked to leave by the
board. According to co-founder and former Echo company member Becky
Arntzen, now the producing co-director of the conference, "The board
felt we had too many plays that all sounded the same. We had a lot of
black comedies. We wanted to be more rooted in Southern California
and a little more diverse ethnically."</TE>
<TE>   Fields disagreed with Arntzen's assessment, citing his inclusion
of black playwright Elroyce Jones' "A Thimble of Smoke" and two plays
by Adam Rapp that "came from a deep, dark place."</TE>
<TE>   His departure was "not a comfortable leave-taking," he said, so he
hasn't kept up with the conference since he left. But the programming
this year "sounds very sexy, glitzy, high-end," he said. "I hope it
goes well."</TE>
<TE>   Two artistic co-directors, actress Kaitlin Hopkins and dramaturge
Robert Menna, filled in last year, but both left for better-paying
jobs, Arntzen said. Egan directed a reading last summer, and he was
hired last fall as artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   The 24 actors this summer include such names as Dana Delany, Ron
Rifkin, Salome Jens, Robert Beltran and Daniel Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The conference takes place on the grounds of Happy Valley School.
"It's a theater summer camp," Maxwell-Brown said. Many of the campers
"sleep in an overheated dorm with ants and stay up late at night
talking."</TE>
<TE>   "It's so beautiful here," Kopit said. "It's not a good place to
work if your play is about your unhappy childhood." His play is about
Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca.</TE>
<TE>   Kopit said the Ojai conference is "much more protected" from
commercial considerations than is the National Playwrights Conference
in Waterford, Conn., which was the original inspiration for the Ojai
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think movie people will jump in their cars to find their
next projects here," Egan said. "It's very much about the
playwrights' need to work on their plays."</TE>
<TE>   The weekend schedule at the Playwrights Conference includes a
symposium on political theater with Baitz, Kopit and Kelly Stuart
tonight, readings of "Discovery of America" (Friday), Goldberg's
"Katzman and the Mayor" and Stuart's "Mayhem" (Saturday), and
Alfaro's "No Holds Barrio" and Baitz's "The Paris Letter" (Sunday),
plus a Teen Playwrighting Workshop presentation Saturday afternoon.

<HD>It's Hugh Hefner, to the Rescue</HD>
<DH>The Playboy publisher has been active in saving films,
especially ones he enjoyed in his youth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he was a small boy growing up in Chicago in the '30s, Hugh
Hefner loved two things above all: horror and mystery movies.</LD>
<LD>   "King Kong" and Sherlock Holmes fascinated him. His favorite actor
was Boris Karloff, who portrayed Dr. Frankenstein's mangled
creation--a monstrous protagonist with a sad slit for a mouth--in a
series of 1930s pictures. Such was young Hefner's ardor for all
things of mystery and horror that he began pouring it in a penny
newspaper he circulated among the neighborhood kids.</LD>
<LD>   "Movies were my escape into the dreams and fantasies of what might
be," the 76-year-old founder of Playboy magazine said recently. His
own life has unfolded more like a luminous old Hollywood musical than
a shadowy thriller, but the debonair-about-town and entrepreneur
extraordinaire still has a soft spot for the B-grade favorites of his
childhood.</LD>
<TE>   Which explains why, for the past couple of decades, Hefner has
funneled funds into the restoration of cinematic relics from
Hollywood's golden era.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to his money gifts, the original nitrate negatives of six
Sherlock Holmes films, and a dozen other hard-boiled detective movies
and American musicals from the 1920s and the 1930s, have been plucked
out of studio vaults. The films are hardly forgotten masterpieces;
rather, Saturday matinee movies that might be lost otherwise. To
Hefner, they are a beloved link to times past.</TE>
<TE>   "In this latter part of my life, this connection has become
increasingly important, because it's a time of reflection, a time of
looking back, a time of giving back," he said during an interview at
his Holmby Hills manse.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning forward from the edge of a raspberry and khaki couch in
his study, Hefner reminisced about his infatuation with films as a
child. "In the movies you found love," he said. "It was a fantasy
form of love, it was a romantic love, but it was ... my dream."</TE>
<TE>   His face was lined, but youthful insouciance still glowed in his
eyes. He wore a sangria-red silk robe with casual aplomb. Around him,
several mahogany-trimmed bookcases were lined with decades' worth of
yearly editions of the Motion Picture Guide, suggesting the hunger
for cinematic detail of a movie aficionado.</TE>
<TE>   The talk turned again to his bond with the movies he rescued,
among them three Dr. Fu Manchu pictures. "When I got a library card
in eighth grade, the first book that I ever took out of the library
was 'The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu,' " Hefner said. Ever since, he has
been partial to the cinematic adventures of the fearsome Chinese
surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   The campy Asian character first carried out his vengeful mission
against the Western aggressors who killed his family during the Boxer
Rebellion, in a series of turn-of-the-century pulp novels by British
writer Sax Rohmer. He later migrated to the screen, where Manchu was
played by Warner Oland in three talking films released by Paramount
Pictures between 1929 and 1931: "Daughter of the Dragon" "The
Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu," and "The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu."</TE>
<TE>   Until he reached his teens, Hefner was not allowed to watch horror
movies, so perhaps it's not a surprise he was fascinated by those.
"And the horror movies in the 1930s, of course, were not slasher
films," he said. "They were these classic things--'King Kong,' which
is still one of my all-time favorite films, and 'Frankenstein,' and
'Dracula.' "</TE>
<TE>   Since 1987, when Hefner first began collaborating on film
restoration projects with the UCLA Archive, he has helped rescue 19
and has contributed just shy of $900,000, said Tim Kittleson, the
archive's director.</TE>
<TE>   Hefner has often remarked that movies are the medium that best
captures the quintessential vitality of the American spirit. "The
dreams," he said raising his voice with theatrical intensity, "what
we think of as the American Dream, are really definitions that have
particularly come out of those wonderful films from the '30s and
'40s. Films by Capra and by John Ford [have] defined the
stereotypical American character, the best of who we aspire to be,
our sense of personal freedom. And it is the part of America that the
rest of the world loves."</TE>
<TE>   In the past Hefner has also financed "a couple of very good
documentaries," as he put it, about the original "It" screen siren,
Clara Bow, and Frances Marion, one of the earliest female
screenwriters.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it's not a business, so the preservation of films is
primarily a raising of consciousness among the general public of the
need to save movies," Hefner said. But there are brand-new projects
waiting in the wings too.</TE>
<TE>   As of late, the man who produced Roman Polanski's "Macbeth" in the
'70s and was the first to unleash upon American audiences the zany,
Dadaist antics of Britain's legendary comedy troupe Monty Python has
fresh plans for cinematic action.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago he founded Alta Loma Productions, a company dedicated
to non-Playboy film and television projects. Stan Lee approached him
with an idea for a cartoon feature starring him and the Playboy
bunnies as superheroines. "Kind of campy, you know: bunnies by day,
crime fighters by night," Hefner said with a big grin.</TE>
<TE>   A film biography of his life is also in the works, with producing
duo Ron Howard and Brian Grazer attached to the project. The story is
pure cinematic gold: The suave tycoon who cuts a good figure with
women excels at business to the chagrin and admiration of fellow men.
The trailblazer who mellows out into a gentleman of considerable
stature and--ahem--a certain age, and turns to philanthropy.
Except--who could ever rise up to the task of portraying Hef on
screen?</TE>
<TE>   "In the olden days it would have been Jimmy Stewart," suggested
the man himself. "Today? I'm not sure."</TE>

<HD>Mozart and Moonlight: Twice in the Same Week</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hollywood Bowl would like you to think it's always like this: the
weather warm, the moon full, the music Mozart. It rarely is, of
course, but Tuesday was the pleasant exception, when even police
helicopters were few and the audience relatively attentive.</LD>
<LD>   Although Mozart has traditionally been a favorite composer for the
Bowl, it is always a surprise when music this intimate actually works
in a environment best suited for larger rhetoric. And perhaps it was
that Mozartean fragility that inspired the Los Angeles Philharmonic
to be careful yet not unclever in the selection of individual works
and in their preparation.</LD>
<LD>   The conductor was Gerard Schwarz. It is the first summer in 20
years that he has not been head of the Mostly Mozart Festival at
Lincoln Center in New York, and the Mozartean urge is clearly still
upon him. The program was evergreen and almost failure-proof, working
through Mozart's most alluring serenade, "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,"
his most dramatic piano concerto, No. 20 in D minor, and one of his
most enthusiastic and charismatic symphonies, No. 36 ("Linz"). The
soloist, in his Bowl debut, was Stewart Goodyear, who cares enough
about this music to improvise cadenzas.</LD>
<TE>   There was one special precaution, and maybe a controversial one.
Breaking with the convention of offering different classical programs
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the Philharmonic decided to repeat this
Mozart event tonight. That provides twice the normal rehearsal time.
(But it may also suggest that the Bowl no longer automatically
expects an audience eager for classical music more than once a week.)</TE>
<TE>   It would be an exaggeration to say that there were any revelations
Tuesday night. But the performances were solid, interpretatively
unobjectionable and quite well played. The dial twiddlers in the
sound booth also had extra time to refine the amplification.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz certainly took advantage of his rehearsal opportunities.
He likes a big sound and he likes speed and agility; his compromise
is to drive a plush medium-sized orchestra with spirit directly down
the middle of the road, never swerving left (into the no-speed-limit
early music zone) or right (into the old-school Romantic approach).</TE>
<TE>   The wild card was Goodyear in the D-Minor Concerto. The
24-year-old Canadian pianist played as though he were generally on
Schwarz's wavelength--with the exception of his improvised cadenzas,
he took the concerto at face value. If he did not bring an overly
strong personality to the intense concerto, he nevertheless provided
thorough musicianship and technical surety. And it is possible that
there were subtleties to his phrasing and tone unable to survive in
the great outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear's cadenzas were ever so slightly nervous-making. The few
pianists who improvise these cadenzas tend to either immerse
themselves in the Mozartean style (as does Robert Levin) or bring a
more modern sensibility (like Chick Corea). Goodyear, in keeping with
the entire tone of the evening, avoided either extreme. His
improvisations remained mostly within Mozart's style, but only near
the end of the first movement cadenza did he find his groove and
start to build up sonorities that suggested something individual.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was a bold effort--Andre Previn, a master improviser,
once said that he sweated bullets the one time he attempted to
improvise cadenzas in a Mozart concerto--and whether he has an
inspiration or not, his daring helps make the entire work remain
fresh.</TE>
<TE>   The "Linz" Symphony got a lively and lush reading. It was good to
hear Schwarz, music director of the Seattle Symphony and Royal
Liverpool Orchestra, play Mozart with a better ensemble than he
usually works with. The Philharmonic here sounded like honey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic repeats its Mozart program with
Gerard Schwarz and Stewart Goodyear tonight, 8 p.m., $1-$76,
Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Ave., L.A. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<LD>Today in the villages of Chechnya, ragtag rebels fighting for freedom
from an oppressive Russian occupation are plotting new strategies to
gain the upper hand.</LD>
<LD>   Russian soldiers, meanwhile, are busy revising their own plans in
the ongoing campaign to maintain their country's territorial
integrity and send an unmistakable warning to other would-be
breakaway republics.</LD>
<LD>   And nearby, in the country of Georgia, U.S. forces sent to ferret
out Al Qaeda watch with growing concern as the strong-arm Russian
tactics drive formerly moderate Chechen refugees in the area into the
arms of Islamic extremists.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to another outpost in the grave new world of global
politics, the focus of tonight's harrowing PBS documentary,
"Greetings From Grozny" (8 p.m. KCET, 10 p.m. KVCR). Part of the
"Wide Angle" series from WNET in New York, the program is filmed from
several perspectives around the Chechen capital that take advantage
of rarely approved access in some cases and hidden cameras in others.</TE>
<TE>   Segments shot in the homes of village residents as Russian troops
on "cleansing missions" arrive to remove suspected rebels have a
heart-stopping intensity, and a closing interview with U.S.
Ambassador Steve Pifer helps remind us how the seemingly distant
developments of today have a way of exploding onto our front pages
tomorrow.</TE>

<LD>Though it clocks in at under 90 minutes, DreamWorks' big-budget,
CGI-driven adaptation of H.G. Wells' cautionary fable "The Time
Machine" ticks off as slowly as a three-hour dirge. And the DVD ($20)
of the action-thriller staring Guy Pearce doesn't do much better.</LD>
<LD>   The digital edition, directed by the author's great-grandson,
Simon Wells, includes a wide-screen transfer of the film and a
behind-the-scene featurette on the design and creation of the
futuristic Morlocks, including an interview with visual-effects
artist Stan Winston. There is also an animated sequence featuring
Simon Wells' original storyboards and insightful commentary from
producer David Valdes, production designer Oliver Scholl and
visual-effects supervisor James E. Price.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   New Line's digital edition of "John Q" ($27), which stars Denzel
Washington, Kimberly Elise, James Woods, Anne Heche and Robert
Duvall, is an overheated drama that almost literally wears its heart
on its sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   Washington plays a devoted family man who, in desperation, takes
an emergency room hostage when his insurance won't cover his son's
heart transplant surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But the DVD includes a terrific and often terrifying documentary
"Fighting for Care," which examines organ transplants and insurance
coverage difficulties the patients face. Interviews with actual
organ-transplant patients as well as the medical staff at UCLA
Medical Center, which operates one of the country's largest
transplant programs, are among its highlights.</TE>
<TE>   The disc also includes a standard behind-the-scenes documentary, a
script-to-screen function on the DVD-ROM, and passable commentary
from director Nick Cassavetes--whose young daughter has congenital
heart problems--screenwriter James Kearns, production Mark Burge,
director of photography Rogier Stoffers and actress Elise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Kung Pow: Enter The Fist" misfires. Badly.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Oedekerk stars in, wrote and directed this slapstick farce
that takes a Hong Kong martial arts flick from 1976 and adds new
footage and dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the jokes fall flat on their face--Woody Allen did it far
better more than 30 years ago with "What's Up, Tiger Lily?"</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition (Fox, $27) improves on the film, including a
"making of" featurette showing how special effects enabled Oedekerk
to step into the action of the old Hong Kong movie, a look at the
visual effects, and a photo gallery.</TE>
<TE>   One alternate dialogue track features the original Chinese
dialogue from the film; the second is a "books-on-tape" version that
features a British actor reading the inane dialogue in a very tony
accent. In Oedekerk's commentary, he talks about the 100 vintage
martial arts movies he viewed until he found the right one to spoof.</TE>

<HD>'Ugly Duckling,' With Western Twist, Is a Beauty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Ya ought not to make fun of this little feller....Ya never know what
the world has in store."</LD>
<LD>   The "Ugly Duckling," cowboy style.</LD>
<LD>   That western twist on a fairy tale classic is just part of what's
in store for audiences at the Occidental Children's Theater's latest
summer frolic, the "The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly Duckling," funny
folk tales mixed with zingy physical comedy for the whole family.</LD>
<TE>   Back for its seventh season at Occidental College's outdoor Remsen
Bird Hillside Theater, this dynamic company of talented actors,
guided by artistic director Jamie Angell, is as fresh and
entertaining as ever.</TE>
<TE>   In the show's "Ugly Duckling" centerpiece, a bad kitty (Olivia
Killingsworth) is a major player in the illegal rare-bird trade,
stealing eggs and selling the fledglings. Her plans for a
particularly large egg, however, go awry, and the resulting strange
hatchling (Ursula McClelland) is rejected by a daffy duck (Aaron
Henne), who relinquishes its care to a mysterious cowboy (Joe
Quadres).</TE>
<TE>   With his help, Ugly finds her real family, despite a mean sheriff
("In these here parts, bein' ugly is a hangin' offense"), Kitty's
bumbling canine henchmen and goofy one-liners throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Three other wacky adaptations precede this ducky tale: "The Fox
and the Monkey," a humorous cautionary fable from Bolivia; "Foma
Berennikov," a Russian yarn about a one-eyed simpleton who
inadvertently becomes a hero (a hilarious turn by tall, lanky Joseph
Chandler); and "The Flying Head." In this strange little Iroquois
tale, actors Quadres, Chandler and Eamon Armstrong portray the
marauding, monster head.</TE>
<TE>   All four tales are brought vividly to life without benefit of sets
or props, save for long wooden poles and swaths of black cloth. These
are creatively manipulated by the actors to serve as walls, houses,
rivers, mountains and more.</TE>
<TE>   The actors themselves, solo and in acrobatic groups, use their
bodies to form thrones, boats, trees, doors, and a stew pot
(Killingsworth) that the greedy Monkey (Quadres) gets stuck on his
head.</TE>
<TE>   One memorable innovation: a "babbling brook" formed by three
actors lying flat on their backs in a vertical row. They comically
underscore the action of the scene with a steady stream of hot air
and petulance, punctuated by their fretfully waving hands. As the
brook dries up, the actors, one by one, somersault out of the scene.
It's a little gem of a performance in this unpretentiously clever
show.</TE>

"Best Musical Album for Children" for its "inFINity" CD, will appear
in concert at the Getty Museum on Aug. 17. And longtime folk

<DL></DL>
<LD>One might well expect good, pun-some cheer from an exhibition of
paintings called "Buena! Ventura," Susan Cook's current show of
landscape paintings and other friendly subjects at the Buenaventura
Gallery.</LD>
<LD>   She deals with mostly local scenery, of the natural and urban
variety, and tosses in the odd close-up portrait of a cow's mug (in
"Wheeler Canyon Dweller") and a lounging surfer. Nothing out of the
realm of the pleasant so far.</LD>
<LD>   What sets her work apart from the garden-variety genres she
applies herself to is a blend of artistic effects and mannerisms,
which keep giving her imagery a dark intrigue. Her compositions are
just slightly askew, her brusque brushwork leans away from details
and edges of things, even flirting with abstraction at times. Most
conspicuously, her scenes have an oddly warm, irradiated, reddish
cast to them, as if processed through red and orange filters.</LD>
<TE>   It's not always clear what the intended effect of this stylization
is. In paintings of area road-scapes, like "Chestnut and Main" and
"101 at California St.," the red-bathed views evoke some kind of
surreptitious surveillance, or at least a voyeur's fleeting gaze. An
orderly procession of palm trees is the primary subject of "Highway
150," but they are folded into the dense thicket of color surrounding
them, giving the viewer a concentration of data to process.</TE>
<TE>   Is Cook's goal to impose unexpected psychological layers on the
everyday? Is she wielding her palette in a sneaky Expressionist
manner, in an approach akin to the German "Der Blaue Reiter" school
of Expressionists? Wherever the artist is coming from, she gives us a
fresh take on places and things we think we know and raises
questions, worthy ends in themselves.</TE>
<TE>   * Susan Cook's "Buena! Ventura" exhibition, Buenaventura Gallery,
700 E. Santa Clara St., Ventura. Ends Saturday. Gallery hours: 11
a.m.-4 p.m. (805) 648-1235.</TE>

<LD>Picking a music teacher can be overwhelming, but experts agree that
finding the right one is critical for children to succeed.</LD>
<LD>   Gary L. Ingle, executive director of the Music Teachers National
Assn., suggests parents ask friends and schoolteachers for
recommendations. People who work at music stores or on the faculty of
local colleges can also be a great resource.</LD>
<LD>   Then, he says, interview prospective teachers about their own
schooling and teaching experience. "Arrange to sit in on a lesson and
see how the teaching is done. If the teacher feels sitting in is too
intrusive, ask if they are having a student recital and attend that.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important parents look beyond specific methods and find a
teacher who is appropriate and whose personality is compatible to
their child's," Ingle says. "Find a teacher who creates a dynamic
learning environment that's built on collaboration, trust and
enjoyment."</TE>
<TE>   Here's an overview of some of the many music schools and programs
around Southern California:</TE>
<TE>   The Colburn School of Performing Arts--Around since 1952, it's the
West Coast equivalent of the Juilliard School of Performing Arts.
Classes are for children ages 2 1/2 to 18. 200 S. Grand Ave.,
downtown L.A., (213) 621-2200.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Conservatory of Music--Infants to senior citizens are
enrolled in a wide curriculum; many of the current 1,000 students are
young adults. 100 N. Hill Ave., Pasadena, (626) 683-3355.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Yamaha Music Center--All instructors are certified Yamaha
music education specialists who teach students from 3 years old to
adult. 22817 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance, (310) 539-8882.</TE>
<TE>   Music Rhapsody--Now in its 20th year, the program offers classes
and summer camp experiences at four locations: Manhattan Beach,
Redondo Beach, Santa Monica and Los Angeles. 1603 Aviation Blvd.,
Suite 1, Redondo Beach, (310) 376-8646.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki Program of Los Angeles--With a staff of 12 teachers trained
in the Suzuki method, this program has been in the area more than 25
years. 5233 Lemona Ave., Sherman Oaks, (818) 981-4243.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Israeli Airstrike in Gaza Strip Kills 12," July 23: The
continuing siege and enforced curfew of Palestinians will never bring
the security that Ariel Sharon promised Israeli voters (by 100 days)
after his election. He is not a man of peace. He either does not know
how or is unwilling to bring it about. The latest example is the
assassination of a Hamas leader (plus the deaths of 14 others and the
wounding of many).</LD>
<LD>   The raid was carried out after Hamas' spiritual leader publicly
said his group would call off suicide attacks if Sharon would pull
back his forces from the West Bank. Is there the political will and
wisdom in Washington to bring the violence to an end? We have the
means to do it. Or are the president and the majority in Congress
beholden to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the
conservative Christian coalitions?</LD>
<LD>   The people of Israel and Palestine deserve the chance to live
their lives in peace and possibility.</LD>

<LD>Our children shouldn't have to be wary of strangers. They shouldn't
have to refuse to help those who say they are in need. These are
natural inclinations of normal, well-adjusted human beings. What's
not normal is turning known pedophiles loose in a society of
children. Why do we have to dance around their illnesses?</LD>
<LD>   I think we as a society need to rethink the way we handle sexual
offenders. The idea of "do the crime, do the time, when he's free,
let him be" should not apply to those who have impulse control
problems and the potential of committing atrocious acts upon innocent
minds and bodies.</LD>

<LD>Re "Perilous Nuclear Tunnel Vision," Commentary, July 21:</LD>
<LD>   Is it possible I got the article by Michael Levi and Theresa
Hitchens right? Their issue is not with the concept of President
Bush's jihad against the evil Iraqis. Nor do they challenge the
concept of using nuclear weapons in a sort of preventive way to keep
others from using them. No, their argument is that we have such other
really refined weapons for killing at a distance that we should try
those first and keep the ultimate scare tactic (the nukes) until we
really need it.</LD>
<LD>   We see the aftermath of war in Afghanistan through the pages of
The Times. Boys as sex slaves. Women imprisoned for leaving abusive
husbands. Food promised and not delivered by the U.S. and other
governments. Can we really think it will be a favor to Iraqi citizens
to "liberate" their country, leaving nuclear fallout, starvation,
death and chaos behind us? If there are chemical and biological
weapons and our bombs hit them, will the cloud of chemicals dispersed
into the area win friends and allies for us in the Middle East? How
did we get on this track anyhow? And how do we get off it?</LD>

<TE>   Thank you for publishing Levi and Hitchens' piece on the
alternatives to nuclear assault on Iraq's underground bunkers. As the
House and Senate prepare to fight over whether to include $15.5
million for the development of nuclear "bunker busters," it is
important that the public know that there are more reliable
alternatives that do not blur the distinction between conventional
and nuclear war.</TE>
<TE>   We cannot afford to return to the Cold War fallacy that the only
way to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction is with more
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>

<LD>Does anyone but me see the irony in the cases of the idealistic but
clueless 21-year-old John Walker Lindh, who just got a stiff federal
prison sentence for fighting for the Taliban, and the equally
idealistic and clueless 16-year-old Bahram Rahman, who left his home
in Pakistan to fight for the Taliban and is now being held
indefinitely in appalling conditions in Dasht-i-Shardian by Afghan
warlords (July 21)? It would seem that their grieving parents have a
good deal in common.</LD>

<HD>Don't Blame Greenspan for the Failure of Others</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re Peter Gosselin's July 21 news analysis suggesting that Alan
Greenspan may be a principal cause of the stock market bubble that is
collapsing with a vengeance: Are you serious? How, pray tell, does
the Fed become responsible for the regulation of accounting firms and
the financial statements prepared by public companies?</LD>
<LD>   Gosselin quotes a critic from Morgan Stanley, of all places. To
come to the real culprits, just where was our "investor's advocate"
SEC while all of this was going on? (Rubber-stamping all those
"vapor" dot-com initial public offerings.) And why didn't "friend of
the little guy" Arthur Levitt Jr. [SEC chairman from 1993 to 2001]
dare to raise the issue of irrational exuberance instead of relying
on Greenspan to do his job?</LD>
<LD>   Where was the National Assn. of Securities Dealers? Could it truly
not see what every sensible person knew: that the "research" put out
by its principal member-firms was unadulterated garbage being issued
solely to get underwriting business and hype these "vapor" stocks to
fuel a demand for still more underwriting business?</LD>
<TE>   The Times owes Greenspan a front-page apology.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Grunburg</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It seems that Gosselin is trying to shift the blame for the stock
market bubble collapse from greed in all quarters to Greenspan for
not preventing it. This is a Catch-22 for Greenspan. Had he punctured
the bubble on the way up, everyone would have screamed bloody murder.
Now he is blamed for not doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan has said many times that his job description only is
monetary control, not the stock market. But he did give fair warning.</TE>

<TE>   To you people who call the "surplus paying down the debt"
prosperity of the '90s a "bubble," I say: You wouldn't recognize
prosperity if it jumped up and bit you on the nose.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having just retired after working in a variety of
middle-management positions for more than 45 years, I can easily
explain Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing and all the other companies
that were mismanaged. Creative accounting combined with greed is part
of the reason, but the primary explanation can be found in every
boardroom of every company.</TE>
<TE>   Most chief executives run their companies like dictatorships. They
might hold meetings with their vice presidents, but no matter what
they are discussing, the CEO only wants them to rubber-stamp a
decision that he or she has already made.</TE>
<TE>   For things to improve, senior executives must put their company
first and their CEO second. But they won't do that because they don't
want to lose their perks and high-paying jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, high-level managers just bounce their heads up and down
in unison. The few senior executives with the guts to tell their CEO
the truth probably meet weekly--on the unemployment line.</TE>

<LD>How coincidental that "Investing in Hope, at $50 a Share" (July 22)
appeared the day after our youth group made and distributed 200
lunches on 4th and 5th streets in downtown Los Angeles immediately
following our morning worship services. It has been doing this every
month for the past five years and is a living testament to the
benefits one receives from giving, which your article highlighted.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it's the making and distribution of lunches or handing out
envelopes filled with cash, church congregations in Los Angeles,
Indianapolis and countless other communities commit random acts of
kindness and hospitality much more than they are given credit for.
Your article is a breath of fresh air in the wake of other less
important news about churches that often makes the front pages of
your newspaper.</LD>

<TE>   Centenary United Methodist Church, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I recently had an experience that confirmed for me everything I
read in your article. I was unemployed, depressed and on my way to a
job interview when I exited the San Diego Freeway at La Tijera last
week. I missed the green light, so I had to sit out the red light. I
looked to the left of me, and there was a homeless man reading a
paperback book, "The Bourne Identity," and petting his huge German
shepherd dog.</TE>
<TE>   I rolled my window down and asked him if he liked the book, and he
said he thought it was great. I took the saddest $5 bill you have
ever seen and gave it to him and wished him good health. Right before
the light changed he asked me if I would like a kiss from his dog,
and I said, "Yes." The dog came over to my car, jumped up and gave me
one good lick that completely covered my face from ear to ear! I
don't think he missed a spot of skin on my face.</TE>
<TE>   I went to my interview and smiled the entire time. The attorney
told me he thought I had a great attitude because I kept smiling
during the entire interview, and when I got home there was a message
from him offering me the job. I no longer question what people are
going to do with the five bucks. I give it with sincerity and hope
that they will use it for themselves or their pets.</TE>

<LD>Thanks for "Court Accepts Medical Pot Use" (July 19), your article on
the California Supreme Court's decision to help protect users of
medical marijuana from prosecution. Few of us may realize that
marijuana has been illegal for only about 60 years; its medical use
goes back to 2737 BC.</LD>
<LD>   The court's decision could have a dramatic impact. Thousands here
in California could turn to medical marijuana for relief from
illnesses. Other states could develop comparable policies, thanks to
California's lead. Researchers might become more willing to confirm
that the drug reduces pain, headache, muscle tremors and nausea while
improving appetite. Braver souls might investigate the drug's
potential to treat arthritis, seizures, insomnia and anxiety.</LD>
<LD>   In an age of rising costs for health care, this decision could
help support inexpensive treatment for many ailments. We could all
save vast sums in the long run.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for "Shortage of Preschools in Southland Grows" (July 19).
With all the attention given to shoring up our state's economy these
days, I am shocked that legislators aren't jumping to fix this key
building block, an industry that contributes more than $5 billion to
the state's economy. Instead, child care remains the only part of our
educational system where we expect parents to shoulder the full
financial burden. Right now it costs twice as much to have an infant
in care than a kid at UC Berkeley.</LD>

<LD>Advanced Placement exam--An article in Section A on July 14 about
Fremont High School in Los Angeles erroneously reported that no
students from Fremont had ever passed the Advanced Placement calculus
exam. In fact, 19 students over the last five years have received
scores on that test of three, four or five, according to the Los
Angeles Unified School District. Scores of three and above earn
college credit, and five is the highest score possible.</LD>

<HD>Income Surges 28% at Amgen</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The company says Neulasta sales were
better than expected. The report is a rare piece of good news for the
industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc. reported sharply higher second-quarter results Wednesday,
driven by better-than-expected sales of Neulasta, its
second-generation drug for chemotherapy patients.</LD>
<LD>   The Thousand Oaks-based company said income rose 28% to $412
million, or 38 cents a share, beating Wall Street's estimate by 4
cents. It earned $322 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Revenue
increased 27% to $1.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The results extended the run of good news for Amgen, which on
Monday received approval to market the anti-anemia drug Aranesp to
cancer patients. And it came in sharp contrast to the weak results
plaguing the drug industry.</LD>
<TE>   Amgen shares rose $1.49 to $37.09 on Nasdaq before the results
were announced, then soared to $40.65 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   The company said sales of Neulasta, used to boost white blood cell
production in chemotherapy patients, totaled $110 million in its
first quarter on the market. Amgen cited high demand for the drug,
which is administered once during a 10-day course of chemotherapy.
Neupogen, the first-generation drug, is injected daily.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of both drugs totaled $473 million in the quarter, exceeding
the Wall Street consensus by nearly $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   "They knocked the cover off the ball," said Ronald C. Renaud, an
analyst with Bear Stearns in New York. "The Neulasta launch appears
to be going very, very well. Aranesp is starting to get some
traction. And their forward-looking guidance is in line with most
folks' expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Amgen raised its full-year projection for earnings-per-share
growth. It said the percentage gain would be in the mid-20s, up from
the low 20s, excluding the effect of the Immunex acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would take a noncash $2.4-billion charge in
the third quarter related to the acquisition. The charge, which was
expected, represents a write-off of research and development at
Immunex.</TE>
<TE>   Also as expected, Amgen lowered its sales projections for Enbrel,
the rheumatoid arthritis drug it acquired as part of its purchase of
Immunex. Production problems exacerbated a shortage of the drug,
hammering quarterly sales down to $192 million from $217 million in
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said Enbrel sales for 2002 should range between $750 million
and $800 million, about $100 million less than Immunex's most recent
forecast. For 2003, sales should fall between $1.2 billion and $1.4
billion, down from $1.6 billion, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of patients on Enbrel has fallen to 79,000 from 84,000,
and there are 23,000 people on a waiting list for it, Amgen said. The
company said it hoped to begin supplying some patients on the waiting
list in the fourth quarter. Amgen said it remained on track to open
an Enbrel factory in Rhode Island during the first quarter of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage has benefited Remicade, a rival drug from Johnson &amp;
Johnson, which posted sales of $332 million in the quarter, up 94%.
Remicade sales this year total $577 million, putting the drug on
track to reach the $1-billion mark.</TE>
<TE>   "They certainly have increased the number of patients they serve,
but we have a better drug," Amgen Chairman and Chief Executive Kevin
Sharer said in an interview. When supplies of Enbrel improve, he
said, "we will do fine."</TE>
<TE>   Sharer said the company was sticking with previous peak sales
forecasts for Enbrel of $3 billion by 2004 or 2005.</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call with analysts, Amgen offered new
information on the Food and Drug Administration's action on Aranesp.
The drug is a long-lasting version of the protein erythropoieten,
which spurs red blood cell production. In the cancer market, it
competes with Procrit, a first-generation product marketed by Johnson
&amp; Johnson under a license from Amgen.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said the FDA approved a label that says Aranesp should be
administered once a week for cancer patients. Amgen had hoped for an
every-other-week indication and has conducted numerous studies to
show that the drug is effective when used that way.</TE>
<TE>   An every-other-week indication would have give Aranesp a clear
advantage over Johnson &amp; Johnson's competing drug Procrit, which is
commonly administered off-label on a weekly basis, though its label
calls for three doses a week.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bear Stearns' Renaud said the Aranesp label did not pose
a competitive problem. He said doctors would use Aranesp off- label
every other week once they realize it works and is cheaper than
once-weekly Procrit.</TE>
<TE>   Aranesp, which had sales of $56 million in the quarter, stands to
benefit from quality problems Johnson &amp; Johnson is having with Eprex,
a version of Procrit it markets in Europe. Johnson &amp; Johnson last
week confirmed a federal criminal investigation of the Puerto Rican
factory where Eprex is made. But it is unknown whether the probe is
related to the unexplained rash of blood disorders in patients who
have used Eprex. The disorder, called red blood cell aplasia, has
sickened 141 patients and killed one.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen, during its call, emphasized that it had not observed the
disorder in patients who had used Aranesp. It said only two cases of
the disorder had been linked to its first-generation product, Epogen.
Epogen, sold only to kidney dialysis patients in the U.S., posted
sales of $570 million in the quarter.</TE>

<LD>Wall Street analysts, accused of publicly hawking companies they were
privately trashing, would have to include a statement in their
research reports certifying the accuracy of their views under a rule
proposed Wednesday by federal regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, claiming the proposal
would boost investor confidence in what analysts are saying, voted
unanimously to send the measure out for 30 days for public comment.</LD>
<LD>   Know as Regulation AC, for Analyst Certification, it could be on
the books by the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Securities Industry Assn., which represents
the interests of more than 600 brokerage firms, said, "We support the
fact that the SEC is addressing this issue, but we want to look at
the details."</TE>
<TE>   The reputations of research analysts have taken a beating after an
investigation by New York State Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer uncovered
e-mails between Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analysts in which they slammed
Internet stocks as "junk" while publicly backing them.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, the top U.S. investment bank, agreed to pay $100 million
in May to settle the case. The firm neither admitted nor denied
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC--in conjunction with self-regulatory organizations, the
New York Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers--is investigating about 12 unidentified brokerage firms for
potential conflicts of interest, two more than previously believed.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's proposal also says that research reports would
have to include a statement by the analyst certifying whether the
recommendation is tied to any compensation.</TE>
<TE>   If so, the compensation must be disclosed, along with the amount
and its source.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, analysts would have to attest every quarter that any
stock recommendations made in news media interviews and other public
appearances during the prior quarter must accurately reflect their
own views.</TE>

<HD>WellPoint Profit Soars 71% as Plan Enrollment Increases</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Second-quarter net income beats expectations.
Acquisitions boost membership 27%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks Inc., the biggest publicly traded Blue
Cross Blue Shield health plan, said Wednesday that second-quarter
profit soared 71% on higher enrollment in its health plans.</LD>
<LD>   The Thousand Oaks-based company said earnings surged to $170.7
million, or $1.12 a share, from $99.9 million, or 75 cents, a year
ago. Analysts were expecting $1.08 on average, according to Thomson
First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Enrollment rose 27% to 13 million, boosted by the company's buying
spree, which have gobbled up Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri,
HealthLink and MethodistCare of Texas. Revenue jumped 37% to $4.2
billion in the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   WellPoint has been aggressive in efforts to stem spiraling
health-care costs, exemplified by its high-profile battle to push
federal regulators to allow Schering-Plough Corp.'s Claritin allergy
drug to be sold over the counter to save costs.</TE>
<TE>   The HMO sector is one of the most prosperous, and industry leaders
are expected to meet estimates on profit goals, said Eric Veiel of
Deutsche Bank, who holds no WellPoint shares.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are good as we expected. This year there have been
less signs of irrational pricing in the marketplace," Veiel said.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint shares rose $5.16 to to $75.76 on the New York Stock
Exchange, before the results were released.</TE>
<TE>   * Unocal Corp. said second-quarter net income fell 54% as oil and
natural gas prices were down from a year ago, but the performance
exceeded Wall Street expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The El Segundo-based oil and gas explorer reported net income of
$114 million, or 46 cents a share, down from $247 million, or 99
cents, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings fell to 55
cents from 92 cents but beat the 51-cent average forecast of analysts
polled by Thomson First Call. Revenue fell 7% to $1.36 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal also said it expects earnings of 45 cents to 55 cents for
the third quarter and $1.70 to $1.90 for the year. Analysts have
forecast 47 cents and $1.65, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   * Chiron Inc. of Emeryville said profit rose 40% to $56 million,
or 29 cents a share, beating analysts' average forecast of 26 cents,
boosted by increased sales of its blood tests, inhaled antibiotic and
multiple sclerosis drug. Revenue rose 15% to $299 million. The
results exclude discontinued operations and charges.</TE>
<TE>   * Fidelity National Financial Inc. of Santa Barbara, the nation's
largest title insurer, reported a 34% rise in second-quarter net
income to $112.3 million, or $1.13 a share. Revenue rose 19% to $1.1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Allergan Inc., the Irvine-based maker of the Botox anti-wrinkle
treatment, posted second-quarter net income of $3.8 million, or 3
cents a share, down 83% from $21.9 million, or 16 cents, a year ago
because of costs to spin off a medical device business, Advanced
Medical Optics Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding those costs, earnings were 45 cents, a penny better than
analysts expected. Revenue rose 14% to $475.7 million, boosted by a
better-than-forecast 48% jump in sales of Botox.</TE>
<TE>   Had it been a separate unit for the entire quarter, Advanced
Medical would have reported earnings of $6.6 million, or 22 cents a
share, down from $12.9 million, or 45 cents a share, last year. Sales
edged down 1% to $137.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Conexant Systems Inc. posted a narrower loss for its third
quarter and said it will cut 400 jobs, or 15% of its work force, to
cut costs and focus its chip business. The Newport Beach company lost
$299.4 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with a loss of $744.9
million, or $3.02, a year ago. Revenue dipped 2.5% to $154 million.
The job cuts will save about $20 million a year, Conexant said.</TE>
<TE>   * Footwear maker Skechers USA Inc. said second-quarter earnings
jumped 26% to $21.3 million, or 52 cents a share, exceeding analysts'
expectations of 41 cents, and boosted its full-year forecast to
$1.73, 6 cents higher than Wall Street was anticipating. The
Manhattan Beach company is benefiting from continuing demand for
lower-priced products and strong international demand.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel Posts Profit on Flat Sales</HD>
<DH>Media: The radio station owner also says the reshuffling of
its management team is to improve operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications Inc. posted a
second-quarter profit of $238 million after an accounting change on
flat revenue, and said it initiated a shake-up in management at the
company's radio division to improve operations at its 1,200-station
empire.</LD>
<LD>   The San Antonio-based media giant, which is the nation's biggest
radio station owner and concert promoter, said sales for the quarter
ended June 30 were $2.17 billion, compared with $2.18 billion for the
period a year earlier. Clear Channel's quarterly profit turnaround
compared with a loss of $237 million last year, owing in part to a
change in accounting rules that reduced acquisition-related expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel also warned that its full-year EBITDA, or earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, were expected
to be in the range of $570 million to $585 million, below some
analysts' expectations.</LD>
<TE>   After the release of the results, Clear Channel's shares closed at
$25.38 on Wednesday, up 38 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Clear Channel shares have plunged about 50% in the last two months
amid criticism of the company's business practices and concerns about
its debt load.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Clear Channel said the chief of its radio division,
Randy Michaels, would step down to run the company's new unit on
emerging technologies such as broadband and wireless broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel President Mark Mays will run the radio division
until the company finds a successor for Michaels--a process it
expects will take six to eight weeks. Among the candidates is John
Hogan, who was Michaels' second-in-command.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels' exit stunned radio and music executives, who had viewed
the rough-edged 50-year-old radio veteran as the embodiment of Clear
Channel's aggressive business tactics. Michaels also was surprised
when the subject of leaving his post was broached at a meeting Monday
with Mays, according to people close to him.</TE>
<TE>   Mays, in an interview Wednesday said, "We've been contemplating
this [change] for a long time. Randy has done an incredibly good job
at assimilating assets from disparate companies into a great radio
company."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel sources said Mays and other family members were
concerned about Michaels' flamboyance as congressional critics raised
questions about the radio division's "joint sales agreements" to grab
market share in cities where it owns the legal maximum number of
stations, and its deals with independent record promoters who seek to
influence radio programmers.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said that Mays was uncomfortable with some aspects of
Michaels' stewardship of Clear Channel's programming. The company's
executives had been generally pleased with his push to create radio
"brands," such as the "Kiss" pop format, across dozens of markets.
But they had asked Michaels to tone down some of the company's rock
station Web sites, which feature photos or graphics of scantily clad
women.</TE>
<TE>   And Clear Channel on Wednesday tried to fend off rumors that it
improperly booked "nontraditional revenue" from station-affiliated
concert ticket sales and other non-advertising sales as radio
revenue. Clear Channel said the nontraditional sources accounted for
only 4% of its radio division revenue and that it accounted for them
properly.</TE>
<TE>   "You can bank on the 100% integrity of this management team," said
company founder Lowry Mays on a conference call with analysts.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Blockbuster Inc., the world's biggest video-store chain, posted a
second-quarter profit as DVD and game sales rose and the company said
expenses declined because of an accounting change.</LD>
<LD>   Net income was $41.7 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $15.6 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 3.7% to
$1.06 billion from $1.03 billion, Blockbuster said.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas-based Blockbuster's results in the recent quarter were
boosted by an accounting change that lowered acquisition-related
costs, said spokeswoman Mary Bell. The company also sold and rented
more DVDs and games than in the year-earlier period.</LD>
<TE>   Blockbuster's goodwill balance in the second quarter was reduced
by $1.82 billion, Bell said. The year-earlier period included $43.1
million, or 24 cents, in expenses for amortizing goodwill. New
accounting rules as of Jan. 1 eliminated quarterly amortization
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Operating expenses declined 5.8% to $681.6 million from $723.2
million a year earlier, mostly attributable to the accounting change,
Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Blockbuster rose $2.16, or 11%, to $21.26 on the New
York Stock Exchange. They had fallen 16% this year.</TE>

<LD>The call for greater transparency by corporate CEOs was taken to
extreme lengths when Virgin Group Chairman Sir Richard Branson took
off his clothes to draw attention to a new business venture.</LD>
<LD>   Dangling from a crane above New York's Times Square, Branson
whipped off his clothes--actually, he was wearing a flesh-toned body
suit underneath--as part of a stunt introducing Virgin Mobile USA, a
youth-oriented mobile phone company that his company launched
nationwide this week.</LD>
<LD>   He was playing off the marketing theme that Virgin's prepaid U.S.
mobile service has "nothing to hide" in the way of costly monthly
service charges.</LD>
<TE>   Virgin Mobile USA, in its new partnership with MTV, will market
mobile phones services targeting mobile phone users under the age of
30, and will allow customers to download short music clips known as
"ringing tones," play games and eventually tune in to songs and video
clips.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Al Sharpton filed a $1-billion defamation lawsuit against
AOL Time Warner Inc. over a Home Box Office cable television network
show that aired FBI surveillance tapes of Sharpton discussing a drug
deal.</LD>
<LD>   Sharpton said in the lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court
in Lower Manhattan that Tuesday's broadcast of "Real Sports with
Bryant Gumbel" featuring a segment on corruption in sports failed to
show portions of the 1983 tapes in which Sharpton allegedly rejects
the drug deal. "I will not bend or buckle or bow to a smear
campaign," Sharpton said.</LD>
<LD>   The tape was made as part of a U.S. investigation of boxing
promoter Don King's possible ties to organized crime. It shows an
undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, posing as
a South American drug dealer, asking Sharpton whether he wants to
take part in cocaine trafficking.</LD>
<TE>   Sharpton, a civil rights activist, discussed the drug deal for
several minutes, according to the tape shown by HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "The lawsuit is so silly that it is unworthy of comment," said HBO
spokesman Ray Stallone.</TE>

<LD>Vivendi Universal beat AOL Time Warner Inc. in a bidding war for the
Hives, one of the hottest new rock bands on the global music scene.</LD>
<LD>   Sources say the London-based arm of Universal Records has signed
the Swedish quintet to a three-album pact worth more than $10
million. In an unprecedented move, Universal also granted the Hives
ownership rights to its master recordings after a specified period of
time and agreed to indemnify the group against any lawsuits stemming
from the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The Hives' acclaimed CD, "Veni Vidi Vicious," was released by
Warner Bros. Records in a partnership with the independent Epitaph
label, which had licensed rights to two Hives albums from Swedish
label Burning Heart Records.</LD>
<TE>   Under the arrangement, Warner planned to distribute the Hives'
next album in 2003. But sources say the band believes it has already
fulfilled its obligations under the old deal and intends to release
its next recording on Universal. Burning Heart is preparing a lawsuit
over the matter, sources said.</TE>

<HD>Countrywide Offers to Settle Billing Lawsuit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plaintiffs' lawyers and Countrywide Home Loans Inc. have offered to
settle a class-action lawsuit that accuses the national lender of
overbilling consumers for credit reports required to secure
mortgages.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of customers who obtained a first mortgage between July
1996 and April 2002 recently received proposed terms through the
mail. Calabasas-based Countrywide denied any wrongdoing in the letter
and declined to comment further Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A Tarzana lawyer who is part of the suit as a borrower called the
proposal inadequate. "It provides nothing of value for the class
members," Howard Strong said, "and they're being asked to give up
their legal rights against Countrywide, in essence, for nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposed settlement, the company would pay $7.50 to more
than 5,419 borrowers who may have been overcharged while getting a
loan at a branch office in Brea. In addition, 264,000 consumers would
receive a $35 coupon that could be used for a one-time discount to
obtain or refinance a home loan through Countrywide.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement could cost Countrywide more than $9 million if
every consumer cashed in the discount. But analysts said that
historically such certificates have been redeemed in small numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "They usually get tossed out as junk mail," said Khalid Elhassan
of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, a group that advocates for civil
and consumer rights</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide also agreed to follow several measures for two years,
including charging California customers the actual cost to the
company for credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   A final hearing to determine the proposal's merits has been
scheduled for Sept. 11 in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide's parent, Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., reported
strong second-quarter earnings Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Falling mortgage rates boosted home sales and refinancings enough
to lift net income 55% to $190.9 million, or $1.48 a share, from a
year earlier. Revenue rose 45% to $998.3 million. The company expects
to exceed analysts' estimates in the next two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Countrywide rose $3.47 to $43.04 on the New York Stock
Exchange, their biggest gain in more than two years.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Loses Trademark Suit Over 'Barbie' Song</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc.'s trademark for Barbie wasn't infringed by a MCA Records
Inc. song called "Barbie Doll," which poked fun at the world's
biggest toy maker's blond creation, an appellate court ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the use of the word
"Barbie" in the song title was an artistic expression designed to
attract consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The suit tested Mattel's ability to control depictions of a toy
that has become a cultural icon. Mattel said the song's lyrics, laced
with sexual innuendo, would harm the value of its Barbie trademark.</LD>
<TE>   "With fame often comes unwanted attention," wrote Judge Alex
Kozinksi in an opinion published Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Mattel couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The El Segundo-based toy maker sued MCA, a unit of Vivendi
Universal, and other record labels that produced and distributed a
1997 album by the Danish band Aqua containing the song "Barbie Girl."</TE>
<TE>   A district court sided with MCA, saying the song was a parody.</TE>
<TE>   MCA Records President Jay Boberg said, "This ruling was important
for MCA Records as it affirms our artists' rights to express
themselves freely."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel and MCA officials traded barbs in the media after the
original lawsuit was filed. MCA countersued for defamation, after
Mattel said using the term Barbie in the song was akin to theft.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Shift .Net Effort to Big Companies</HD>
<DH>Software: Chairman Bill Gates concedes that the
Internet-based system has failed to attract consumers but points to
dozens of firms using it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>REDMOND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Acknowledging that his 2-year-old vision of an Internet-based
computing system has yet to catch on with consumers, Microsoft Corp.
Chairman Bill Gates said the firm is shifting focus toward big
companies that use the architecture internally.</LD>
<LD>   Gates said the company had been too vague about the strategy to
support Web services with a framework called .Net. The .Net term has
been used to describe everything from large servers running recent
versions of Microsoft's operating system to routine transactions over
the Web.</LD>
<LD>   "In some respects we haven't made as much progress as we
expected," Gates told an annual gathering of industry and financial
analysts. "Change has not been as dramatic."</LD>
<TE>   Gates gave the massive .Net effort a "C" grade for such basic
services as the Passport tool used by consumers to move data about
themselves to Web sites and automated alerts for plane schedule
changes or new auction bids. On the positive side, Gates and other
Microsoft executives gave dozens of examples of big companies using
the .Net framework.</TE>
<TE>   And they pointed to significant behind-the-scenes progress as
technology companies, financial services firms and others come
together to pick standards for security and other pieces of technical
plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   It will take two more years before most consumers see Web services
capability built into their home computer operating systems, Gates
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the added challenges is a reluctance by businesses to use
the advanced programming structure because of worries that Microsoft
will tilt the system to favor its other products. Some of the
services touted by Microsoft work only with Microsoft's server
software. A coalition that includes Sun Microsystems Inc., credit
card issuers and merchants is working on an open-source version of
Passport.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see the world divide itself into two
camps--Microsoft and everyone else," said CS First Boston analyst
George Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   Yet analysts and investors said they were impressed with the
progress Microsoft has made and its increased willingness to
collaborate with others in the industry on specifications. On the
consumer front, Microsoft won praise by demonstrating a version of
its Windows XP operating system for the living room, which it
promised to ship this year.</TE>
<TE>   Computers using the forthcoming Windows XP Media Center system
will come with television tuners, remote controls and menus steering
users to DVDs, digital photos and music files. Consumers will be able
to flip through TV channels and select one for live viewing in a
movable window while responding to e-mails and browsing the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Gates and Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said the .Net initiative
will add little to Microsoft sales for years. But they said it's
worth the effort because it will make Microsoft's other products more
valuable if they have increased ability to interact over the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Gates said Microsoft has begun researching how to convert at least
parts of such flagship products as Windows and Office into services
themselves. One day the entire programs may be available only for
rent.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the long run things will be architected that way,"
Gates said.</TE>

<HD>MSC.Software Agrees to Antitrust Case Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Ana maker of simulation software said Wednesday that it has
tentatively settled an unusual federal antitrust case that sought to
undo two acquisitions completed more than two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   MSC.Software Corp., which also reported a second-quarter net loss
but strong sales growth, did not reveal details about the deal with
the Federal Trade Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "The settlement is without precedent," said Chairman Frank Perna
Jr. "There was no trial, no fine, no admission of wrongdoing, no
restatements, no material adverse effect on the company at all."</LD>
<TE>   The FTC said only that administrative court proceedings were
withdrawn last week because the two sides had reached a proposed
consent agreement. The settlement now goes to the FTC board for
approval, which is probable early next month, Perna said.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to step up scrutiny of small mergers and
acquisitions, the FTC alleged last fall that MSC.Software's two
acquisitions gave the company a monopoly on specialized engineering
software used in the automotive and aerospace industries.
MSC.Software fiercely disputed the claim, which could have forced it
to shed businesses that accounted for as much as 39% of its $178
million in sales in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   MSC.Software said it lost $6.1 million, or 21 cents a share, in
its second quarter, contrasted with net income of $2.9 million, or 18
cents, in the same period a year earlier. Results include
restructuring and other one-time charges and write-offs totaling
$10.2 million. Sales rose 95% to $95.1 million, aided by results from
acquisitions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. reported its first quarterly profit increase in more
than a year, as lower costs and new restaurant openings helped offset
weak sales.</LD>
<LD>   Second-quarter net income rose 13% to $497.5 million, or 39 cents
a share, from $440.9 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 4.2% to $3.86 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts expressed concern over the decline in sales at stores
open at least a year, which fell everywhere except in Europe, where
sales were hammered last year by fears of mad cow disease.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. same-store sales fell 1.6% as McDonald's lost customers to
rivals such as Wendy's International Inc. and Diageo's Burger King
chain. Sales in Europe increased 7%, but global sales overall fell
2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's fell 7 cents to $23.77

<LD>Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. reported a 30% rise in quarterly
profit but its shares fell after the company said an insider-trading
probe involving its founder is scaring off advertisers.</LD>
<LD>   The shares tumbled 95 cents, or 8.5%, to $9.05 on the NYSE after
the media and housewares company said third-quarter and full-year
profit will miss estimates.</LD>
<LD>   The stock had lost 47% of its value since early June, when a
congressional panel began investigating Martha Stewart's sales of
ImClone Systems Inc. shares.</LD>
<TE>   Advertisers are waiting to place new ads until the investigation
is resolved, Chief Financial Officer James Follo said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has said she did nothing wrong when she sold ImClone
shares the day before regulators rejected the company's application

<TE>   The company said net income rose to $6.74 million, or 14 cents a
share, on a 16% rise in sales to $78.6 million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadcom Corp., accused of improperly using National Semiconductor
Corp.'s patented technology, filed court papers claiming it's the one
whose patents were infringed.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcom, the biggest maker of cable-modem chips, contends that
National Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, Calif., stole
technology related to Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet products,
according to court documents. Broadcom made the allegation in a court
filing in National Semiconductor's suit against Broadcom.</LD>
<LD>   In May, National Semiconductor, which makes semiconductors for
cell phones and personal computers, filed a federal lawsuit in
Sacramento, accusing Broadcom of making and selling microchips that
infringed its patents related to modems, servers and other networking
equipment. Broadcom, based in Irvine, said it didn't believe the
National Semiconductor patents applied to current Broadcom products.</LD>
<TE>   Broadcom is seeking damages and a court order blocking National
Semiconductor from selling any infringing products.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Broadcom and National Semiconductor couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom shares rose 25 cents to $19.77 on Nasdaq, while National
Semiconductor shares rose 56 cents to $20.95 on the NYSE, before news
of the suit was released.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>BioPulse International Inc. settled a lawsuit filed by federal
regulators, agreeing to stop claiming its insulin-injection
treatments can eliminate cancerous tumors and effectively treat other
serious diseases.</LD>
<LD>   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the company agreed to
stop advertising that the treatments, which involve inducing sleep by
injecting insulin into cancer patients, can "starve" tumors,
according to court papers filed in San Francisco federal court.
Patients paid up to $40,000 for the treatments.</LD>
<LD>   The company, based in South Jordan, Utah, also agreed to stop
making health claims about a treatment in which patients sit in front
of a light source.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, BioPulse's cancer clinic in Tijuana was shut down by
local health officials after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission told
the company it was investigating its advertising claims. The clinic's
treatments included inducing daily comas in patients and injecting
them with vaccines made from their urine.</TE>

<HD>AOL Discloses SEC Inquiry Into Ad Deals</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The focus is on the accounting of
transactions at America Online. Separately, the company posts a
profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. said the Securities and Exchange Commission had
launched a "fact-finding inquiry" into the accounting treatment of
some advertising transactions at its America Online unit in 2000 and
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons disclosed the investigation
Wednesday during a conference call to discuss the media giant's
second-quarter earnings, which were slightly better than expected,
with revenue up 10%.</LD>
<LD>   Parsons said the transactions were reviewed by Ernst &amp; Young, the
company's auditor, which concluded that they complied with accounting
standards and were properly disclosed to investors. Parsons said the
company would cooperate fully with the SEC.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner itself notified the SEC after the Washington Post
raised questions, Parsons added. The newspaper reported last week
that America Online had used unconventional ad deals to boost revenue
to meet Wall Street analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, through a spokesman, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The probe comes at a bad time for AOL Time Warner and Parsons, who
took over as CEO in May and is trying to repair the company's
credibility with investors, who have seen the share price plunge 65%
this year. The poor performance has cost the jobs of former Chief
Executive Gerald Levin and, just last week, Chief Operating Officer
Robert W. Pittman.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons tried to mend fences Wednesday, first by offering more
details on America Online's financial performance than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein said he would be "up
all night" poring over the numbers--including breakdowns of AOL's
subscriber base and its advertising revenue--but he was pleased by
the amount of information about the troubled unit.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons also promised that he and Chief Financial Officer Wayne
Pace would sign new SEC forms attesting to the accuracy and
completeness of the company's financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   The signed forms are a new SEC requirement, so Parsons' statement
should have been no surprise, but analyst John Tinker of Blalock &amp;
Partners said AOL Time Warner's stock was battered during Wednesday's
trading by rumors that the executives might refuse to sign.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick's signing off tells me that they don't expect any more nasty
surprises," Tinker said.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons also tried to defuse rumors that Chairman Steve Case might
be next to leave the company. Case "is my primary partner and
sounding board," Parsons said, adding that contrary to some reports,
Case supported last week's management shake-up.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner shares dropped 15 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange to a new 52-week low of $11.40. News of the earnings and the
SEC inquiry came after the stock market closed, and the shares
continued to lose ground in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   However, analysts were encouraged by Parsons' performance during
the conference call and by indications that the online advertising
slump that has hit America Online may have touched bottom.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner reported net income for the quarter ended June 30
of $394 million, or 9 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of
$734 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Adjusted to reflect new accounting standards, year-earlier
earnings would have been $592 million, or 13 cents a share, so this
year's figures represent a 33% decline.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest drag on earnings continued to be America Online, where
revenue declined 3% and EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization--a popular profit yardstick for media
companies--sank 27% amid the Internet advertising slump.</TE>

<HD>New Landscape for Audit Firms</HD>
<DH>Reform: Legislation would give broad powers to an oversight
board expected to change the way the industry does business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Higher audit fees, a reshuffling of consulting clients and several
high-profile prosecutions probably will result from an agreement on
Capitol Hill on Wednesday on a package of accounting reform measures.</LD>
<LD>   Accounting industry experts said the legislation's establishment
of an independent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, with
broad powers to regulate and discipline the profession, should foster
significant changes in the way auditors conduct business. It replaces
a largely voluntary, self-regulatory system within the profession.</LD>
<LD>   "It is the most significant legislation for accounting since the
establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the
1930s," said former U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, who
headed a much weaker industry oversight board that dissolved in
January.</LD>
<TE>   One immediate result will be higher fees as audit standards
tighten and as company boards of directors demand more assurance that
the numbers are right, said senior accounting firm partners and other
industry experts.</TE>
<TE>   House and Senate negotiators reached an agreement on the structure
and powers of the board Wednesday, ending weeks of debate. It is part
of a broader corporate reform package that lawmakers expect to send
to the White House as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first public body that will have real oversight over
all of the auditing industry's operations," said Bowsher, adding that
the voluntary board he headed lacked both the power of a legislative
mandate and the support of the accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   The new body, which must be appointed by the SEC within 90 days on
enactment of the legislation, will set auditing and ethical standards
for the profession. These standards range from the minute--how often
or how many times auditors should look at a specific type of
transaction--to the significant, such as what constitutes a breach of
professional ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it uses that power will largely be up to whoever becomes
chairman of the five-member board and the other individuals on the
panel. The board is expected to consist of two accountants and three
people who are not accountants but who are familiar with financial
reporting issues and rules. The members will work full time for the
panel and will not be allowed to collect pay from the accounting
industry or other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts are already bracing for a series of high-profile
investigations out of the board as it moves to assert its authority.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of severe sanctions on individuals or even firms will
change the way this profession operates," said Bill Cummings, an
accounting professor at Northern Illinois University.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the threat of outside disciplinary action "is forcing
people to make sure that they are getting the numbers right," said a
senior partner with one of the Big Four accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be the most invasive thing the industry has ever seen
in our lives or it could be only marginally different," said Bob
Bunting, chief executive of Seattle-based Moss Adams, a large
second-tier firm based in Seattle. "If the chairman wants to be an
aggressive regulator, this will be an agency as significant as the
SEC."</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms that conduct public-company audits will have to
register with the board. Their registration fees will provide funding
for the panel and its staff, which will have the power to inspect the
work of auditors and investigate wrongdoing. The board will be able
to levy fines, issue sanctions and even ban individual auditors and
firms it determines are negligent.</TE>
<TE>   "You will have real discipline, where right now you have no
discipline," said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor and securities
crime expert at Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   In a move to strengthen the independence of accountants, the
legislation also tightens restrictions on consulting services that
accounting firms can perform for audit clients.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Big Four accounting firms have spun or sold off large
pieces of their consulting businesses, especially in information
technology, the firms still earn significant revenue from financial
and management consulting.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Bowsher said that the firms were partially
responsible for helping companies to develop and structure many of
the off-balance-sheet and often off-shore ventures that have been at
the core of the series of recent accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you will be auditing the ventures set up by others rather
than by just another wing of the same firm," Bowsher said. He
believes such a system will provide both more independence and a
greater check on accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   "These types of reforms would not have prevented outright fraud by
top management," said Cummings of Northern Illinois University. But
he said they will reduce the kinds of abuses seen with accounting
firm Arthur Andersen and its work for troubled energy trader Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen might have resisted the pressure to overlook Enron's
sleazy accounting if it wasn't worried about losing more than $20
million in annual consulting work," Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings expects to see a lot of shifting of consulting clients
between the biggest firms as they comply with new independence
standards. In some instances, a firm might decide to drop an audit
client to hold on to a lucrative consulting contract, he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd., the worldwide fiber-optic network builder that
is trying to revamp itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,
said Wednesday that it has moved the date for a private auction of
its assets to July 31.</LD>
<LD>   The auction, which was to be Wednesday at the New York office of
Global's bankruptcy lawyers, is more a negotiation process in which
the company is trying to obtain more-favorable terms for creditors
from those that submitted bids earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, several bids may be combined, including Global's
plan for emerging from bankruptcy as a stand-alone company. The
Bankruptcy Court is scheduled to hear any objections and possibly
approve a winning bid on Aug. 7.</LD>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing Ltd., Global's 59%-owned unit, is close to a
sale to bring in $400 million in financing, an amount its parent
promised but failed to deliver last fall. Asia Global is expected to
go into bankruptcy with a prepackaged plan and emerge quickly with
new investors in charge.</TE>

<HD>White House Unaware of Pitt Bid for Raise</HD>
<DH>Securities: The SEC chairman is said to have acted on his
own in seeking Cabinet status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, was acting on his own when he asked Congress for a
promotion and a raise, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush did not know about the request until he read news
accounts about it, Fleischer said.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Fleischer declined to criticize Pitt, saying: "I think it's
always a prerogative of independent agencies to talk to Congress."</LD>
<TE>   Pitt declined to answer questions Wednesday about the request, but
SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan defended the action.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an informal suggestion to the conference on behalf of the
agency," she said, referring to lawmakers working on legislation to
fight corporate fraud. Pitt's intent, Harlan said, was to raise the
agency's profile and attract the most qualified accountants, lawyers
and economists.</TE>
<TE>   "It had nothing to do with the chairman," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's lobbying efforts to elevate the SEC to full Cabinet status
and to raise the chairman's salary to $166,700 from $138,200 was
first reported by the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Key lawmakers reached agreement on the reform measure Wednesday,
and the White House announced that Bush would sign it. The final
version does not include the changes Pitt sought.</TE>
<TE>   As for giving the SEC Cabinet status, Fleischer said: "The SEC is
on top of their job and doing it well. And they have the status that
they need to enforce the laws."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has become a divisive figure because of his past close ties
with the accounting industry as a securities lawyer. Several top
lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have called for Pitt's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really surprised to see Mr. Pitt's recommendations,"
Daschle said Wednesday. "Of all the things that he has to think
about, it is amazing to me that this is what he's spending his time
thinking about."</TE>

<HD>LeapFrog Fetches $117 Million in IPO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LeapFrog Enterprises Inc., a maker of educational toys backed by
Michael Milken and Larry Ellison, raised $117 million Wednesday in an
initial public offering.</LD>
<LD>   LeapFrog sold 9 million shares at $13 each, at the bottom of the
$13-to-$16 range the company had indicated. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney managed the sale.</LD>
<LD>   The IPO comes amid a stock market slump that has limited sales of
new equity. Four planned IPOs were pulled this week, boosting the
amount of canceled sales in the last month to more than $3.1 billion.
Pacific Energy Partners, an oil pipeline operator controlled by
billionaire Philip Anschutz, raised $167.7 million in an IPO on
Monday--as much as 10% less than planned.</LD>
<TE>   LeapFrog, based in Emeryville in the Bay Area, said last month
that it planned to use proceeds from the IPO for debt repayment and
expansion. Knowledge Universe--controlled by Ellison, chairman and
chief executive of Oracle Corp., with Milken, the former junk bond
financier, and his brother Lowell Milken--owns a stake valued at $325
million to $400 million, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   LeapFrog Enterprises shares are scheduled to begin trading on the
New York Stock Exchange today under the ticker symbol LF.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp. and Cigna Corp. on Wednesday became the latest
companies to announce stock buybacks.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, said it would repurchase as many as
20 million shares of its common stock. That would cost $885 million
based on Wednesday's closing price of $44.25, up $2.59, on the NYSE.
Tenet has bought about 19 million shares of its stock under two
previously announced buyback plans that authorized the repurchase of
30 million shares.</LD>
<LD>   After the market closed, insurer Cigna said it planned to buy back
as much as $500 million of its stock. Cigna's shares closed at
$81.90, up $4.46, also on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   Companies including Merck &amp; Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., PepsiCo
Inc. and Clorox Co. have announced buybacks in recent days as their

<HD>Stocks Rally as Investors Seek Bargains</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Several battered sectors lead the rebound.
NYSE trading volume sets record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Utilities, chemical companies, financial firms and retailers led Wall
Street's spectacular rebound Wednesday, though the stock market's
breadth overall wasn't dramatically positive on a day of huge gains
in key indexes.</LD>
<LD>   In other markets, Treasury yields jumped from record lows as money
left bonds for stocks, and gold slipped. But the dollar lost value
despite the surge in equity prices.</LD>
<LD>   At the stock market's opening it looked like another day of heavy
losses was in the offing, as the Dow quickly lost 170 points and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slumped 22 points.</LD>
<TE>   At its morning low of 775.68, the S&amp;P was down 49.2% from its
record high in March 2000. That eclipsed the 48.2% peak-to-trough
decline of the 1973-74 bear market, the worst since the Great
Depression.</TE>
<TE>   But share prices soon turned around and continued to rally
throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the reversal reflected a number of factors,
including the arrest of executives of Adelphia Communications on
securities fraud charges, and Congress' agreement on a bill reforming
corporate and accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the market was simply primed for a huge snap-back,
after nine weeks of massive selling that drove many stocks to
five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   By the close, the Dow was up 488.95 points, or 6.4%, to 8,191.29,
its second-biggest one-day point gain ever and the biggest percentage
gain since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P index soared 45.73 points, or 5.7%, to 843.43 and the
Nasdaq composite leaped 61.18 points, or 5%, to 1,290.23.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P small-cap index jumped 4.7%, cutting its year-to-date loss
to 18.1%. The S&amp;P 500 still is down 26.5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume set a record on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a buying panic," said George Mairs, who manages $700
million at Mairs &amp; Power Inc. in St. Paul, Minn. "People are jumping
to get in because they don't want to miss the bottom. No one is
prepared to say the bear market has ended, but the magnitude of this
rally is very impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Still, winners outnumbered losers by 20 to 13 on the NYSE and by
20 to 15 on Nasdaq, breadth figures that weren't particularly
impressive given the gains in key indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' renewed interest in the stock market came partly at
Treasury bonds' expense: The yield on the five-year T-note, which hit
a record low of 3.46% on Tuesday, rose to 3.52% on Wednesday. The
10-year T-note yield ended at 4.47%, up from 4.41% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, gold eased further after tumbling nearly
$11 an ounce Tuesday. Near-term gold futures fell $1.20 to $311.50 an

<TE>   But stocks' gains couldn't help the dollar, which faded after
Tuesday's big rally. The euro rose to 99.5 cents from 98.9 cents,

<HD>Level 3 Bidding for Rival Williams Communications</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Its CEO is positioning the firm to become a
consolidator at a time of industry weakness. Offer for the network
operator is said to be $650 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to buy a competitor at a deep discount, upstart long-distance
company Level 3 Communications Inc. is bidding for rival network
operator Williams Communications Group, which is about to emerge from
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes only two weeks after Level 3, based in Broomfield,
Colo., raised $500 million from private investors, including Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to fund acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   Level 3's existing network has plenty of unused capacity, analysts
say, but the acquisition could provide additional customers to help
fill those pipes.</LD>
<TE>   Level 3 executives declined to comment Wednesday on the possible
deal, which Williams spokeswoman Wendy Lea confirmed without
providing details.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal reported that the value of Level 3's bid
was about $650 million, less than one-tenth of the amount Tulsa,
Okla.-based Williams has invested in the network since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bid is low compared with the cost of building
Williams' network, which connects 125 cities around the globe, it's
high in comparison with the $750 million initially offered for
insolvent Global Crossing's more expansive fiber-optic lines. And
there's no guarantee that Level 3 would operate Williams' network if
its bid is accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 Chief Executive James Crowe is positioning the company to
become a consolidator at a time of industrywide weakness. When he
announced the $500 million in new funding, Crowe said he wanted to
buy telecommunications companies with a similar base of customers
that he could move to his own network, which he claims is more
efficient than other long-distance carriers.</TE>
<TE>   "Buying a competitor means they could potentially decommission
some of their assets," said analyst John Gonsalves of Adventis, a
management consulting firm in Boston. The deal "supports the
philosophy that the last company standing wins," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts expect the long-distance business to be hit by a
wave of consolidation as fierce price competition, fueled by excess
capacity, drives companies into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and Level 3 have much in common, both in their networks
and in the type of customers they target.</TE>
<TE>   Their main customers are other telecommunications companies,
particularly phone companies and Internet service providers. SBC
Communications Inc. is one of Williams' top customers, while Level
3's users include America Online and MSN.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main differences is that Williams' lines reach across
Canada and the Pacific Ocean, not just the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, its network is equipped to carry conventional phone calls,
while Level 3 is built just for data traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Williams filed for bankruptcy protection April 22, announcing that
it planned to continue operations and slash its debt from more than
$7 billion to less than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   These improvements made the company more attractive to would-be
buyers, said analyst David Passmore of Burton Group, a network
analysis firm.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its reorganization, Williams has been trying to attract
a minority investor that would contribute $150 million to its
coffers. The Journal reported that the company was close to a deal
with Leucadia National Corp., a diversified public holding company,
that would raise the needed $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   But July 17, Level 3 offered to buy Williams for $1.1 billion,
with $450 million of that remaining in the acquired company's
coffers, the Journal reported.</TE>
<TE>   Williams got its start as a subsidiary of a company that built and
operated natural gas and petroleum pipelines, running fiber-optic
lines through abandoned pipes.</TE>

<HD>Telecom Bankruptcy Wave May Become Self-Perpetuating</HD>
<DH>Reorganization: Greater competitiveness in pricing could
be a byproduct of companies with leaner operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a handful of telecommunications companies begin to trickle out of
bankruptcy protection, analysts fear their financial reorganizations
could have unintended consequences that exacerbate the industrywide
meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   Many firms that went into Chapter 11 now are preparing to come out
with leaner operations and smaller debts than competitors that didn't
file for bankruptcy protection--a cost advantage that threatens to
perpetuate the industry's instability. Already, bankruptcy alumni
such as Covad Communications Group are undercutting the prices
offered by their rivals.</LD>
<LD>   To make matters worse, the spate of bankruptcy filings--punctuated
by WorldCom Inc.'s record-setting case filed this week--so far is
doing little to solve the industry's underlying problem: a vast
oversupply of fiber-optic networks.</LD>
<TE>   "This may trigger many other bankruptcies, and that would be the
worst case for a fast recovery of the telecom sector and a fast
recovery in investor confidence," said Roger Wery, head of the
telecommunications practice at PRTM, a San Francisco consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said WorldCom's revitalization could do the most damage
to rivals.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a foregone conclusion that WorldCom will emerge from
bankruptcy protection with its debts erased and its strongest
businesses intact. But that's the scenario the company is hoping
for--and the scenario its competitors fear most.</TE>
<TE>   But WorldCom's situation isn't unique. It's just the most visible
example in a long line of telecom companies seeking a second chance
in bankruptcy protection. Covad , which sells high-speed Internet
access, paved the way.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in August with
mounting losses and $1.4 billion in debts, but it left Bankruptcy
Court four months later in trimmed-down shape and carrying debts
totaling just $50 million. Covad's pre-bankruptcy shareholders
retained an 80% stake in the reorganized company and were not wiped
out in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Covad's case was followed by scores of others, including McLeodUSA
Inc., a local phone and data service provider, and Yipes
Communications Inc., a data networking firm. Many others are on the
verge of stepping out from under bankruptcy court protection,
including broadband provider Mpower Holding Corp. and fiber network
operators 360networks Inc., Global Crossing Ltd., XO Communications
Inc., Metromedia Fiber Networks Inc. and Williams Communications
Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April with
$7.15 billion in debt, plans to emerge from Chapter 11 this fall with
debt of $525 million. However, rival Level 3 Communications Inc. this
week made an unsolicited bid to buy the company out of bankruptcy
protection with an offer worth about $650 million.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only a tiny fraction of telecommunications companies have
survived bankruptcy protection. But those that have are going to make
their presence known.</TE>
<TE>   The most damage will be felt in the fiber-optic sector, which
boasts as many as 20 companies selling bandwidth in some major
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Already, prices for high-capacity fiber links are well below cost
and so low that they are a major contributor to the current flow of
bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a customer buying a fiber-optic link between Los
Angeles and New York to carry 155 megabits per second of data would
have paid $1.8 million a year for it in 2000. In 2001, that same
connection cost $590,000 a year, and this year, the price has fallen
to just $194,000, said Alan Mauldin, an analyst at fiber research
firm TeleGeography Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, companies have to sell five times as much capacity to make
the same amount of money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation will be even worse as more and bigger players such
as WorldCom drop their debt and lower their prices.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll go to all the major corporations and bid for their
business with low prices," said Susan Kalla, a telecommunications
analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co. "The customers may not
want to give the business to a company just out of bankruptcy, but
they can certainly use them for leverage to get price concessions
from other companies."</TE>
<TE>   Some firms are slashing their prices before they emerge from
Chapter 11. XO Communications, a network operator which was loaded
down with $4.7 billion in debt when it filed for bankruptcy
protection last month, is waiving the monthly fee for many of its
services and loosening rules to allow month-to-month commitments,
according to David Willis, a researcher at the Meta Group. "That
illustrates the type of behavior we're going to see," he said.</TE>
<TE>   XO spokesman Todd Wolfenbarger acknowledged that the company has
waived fees "to provide some sort of reward or incentive for being
willing to come our way" during reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   If the survival of the post-bankruptcy telecoms will only prolong
the industry's doom, why aren't more of them liquidated instead?
Mainly because liquidation isn't a popular option for the banks,
bondholders and creditors owed billions of dollars when the market is
paying pennies on the dollar for valuable telecommunications assets.</TE>
<TE>   "The reorganization of all these companies is more a function of
the fact that the investors and the creditors are trying to get more
of their money back," said Glen Macdonald, a vice president at
Adventis, a consulting firm. "If they liquidate, they have no chance
of getting their money back."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone buys the notion that the WorldCom bankruptcy filing
and others will trigger a rash of additional bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a theory that goes that everyone files for bankruptcy
because it's going to be viewed as a healthy move and a way to wipe
away the debt," Willis of Meta Group said. But, "the probability of
that happening is very low."</TE>
<TE>   The stigma of bankruptcy, the harm to valuable brands and the risk
of losing customers will keep bankruptcy protection a last-resort
option, he said. Instead, many companies will press their bondholders
and banks for concessions, arguing that it's in their interest to
help the company survive against rivals with far less debt.</TE>
<TE>   "There are restructuring and turnaround opportunities for some of
these companies outside the confines of bankruptcy court, and some of
these companies are going to have to do that," Macdonald said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the industry begins to consolidate, the problem of
overcapacity remains, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem here is that networks never go away--even if the
company disappears, the assets don't," said David Passmore, research
director at Burton Group, a network analysis firm in Sterling, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "As each of these guys go bankrupt, the pain spreads to everybody
else."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Register's Parent Denies Pressure to Sell</HD>
<DH>Publishing: Freedom Communications says it may use an IPO
or other means to provide family owners with liquidity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executive of Freedom Communications Inc., the Irvine-based
media company that owns the Orange County Register, dismissed
speculation Wednesday that the company may be sold under pressure
from members of the Hoiles family that owns it.</LD>
<LD>   But CEO Samuel C. Wolgemuth did confirm that the company was
seeking ways to provide liquidity to the 81 family members whose
wealth is tied up in Freedom stock, calling it a "critical issue" for
any family-owned business.</LD>
<LD>   Wolgemuth declined to specify what options were being looked at,
but analysts said the possibilities could include bringing in outside
investors, a public stock offering, a special dividend or an employee
stock purchase program. Wolgemuth said various proposals would be
discussed next month at an informal gathering of the 50 or so adult
shareholders in the family.</LD>
<TE>   Wolgemuth's comments followed a Wall Street Journal report that
Tim Hoiles, part of a dissident wing long at odds with the rest of
the family, is pressing to sell the company. Hoiles' father, the late
Harry Hoiles, had waged a bitter, unsuccessful court battle
throughout the 1980s with other family members to break up the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles, a Freedom director and head of the company's audit
committee, in an interview said he and other family members were
frustrated with the company's performance and with "seeing the asset
dwindle." He said he had strong support from other family members, an
assertion Wolgemuth and other family members disputed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not aware of anyone in the family other than Tim who has
expressed an interest in selling the company outright," Wolgemuth
said.</TE>
<TE>   That view was echoed by Robin Hardie, who heads a committee of
fourth-generation family members studying options and interviewing
other family members about what they want to do.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a big family. Some of them want to sell out, some want to
diversify their holdings, but many more want the company to remain
private," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom, which owns 28 newspapers and eight television stations,
does not disclose its finances because it is private. But according
to sources familiar with the results, Freedom last year had revenue
of $760 million, lost about $90 million amid the nationwide
advertising downturn and had cash flow of about $120 million.
Analysts place the company's value at $1.5 billion to $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles confirmed that he had hired London investment banker
Christopher Shaw, who has been in the middle of other newspaper
family scraps in the past. Hoiles added that if other family members
don't want to sell the entire company, they can buy him out.</TE>
<TE>   "For a fair and competitive price, they can get me out of there,"
he said. He owns about 9% of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper analyst John Morton said he was skeptical of an outright
sale. He said he believed that most family members wanted to keep
Freedom, which long has sought to uphold the libertarian philosophy
of founder R.C. Hoiles.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be amazed if the majority of the family wants to sell,"
Morton said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Morton said, Freedom and other family-owned media
companies are under intense pressure to provide liquidity to younger
generations eager to cash out or diversify their holdings.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that pressures from the founding Chandler family led to
the $6.8-billion sale in 2000 of Times Mirror, parent of The Times,
to Chicago-based Tribune Co.</TE>
<TE>   At the Register's Santa Ana offices, discussion of the news took
up most of a meeting between editors and reporters that is usually
held to discuss the day's stories.</TE>
<TE>   Employees received an e-mail during the day from CEO Wolgemuth,
promising them that Freedom's shareholders "will work through this
process in a fair and dignified manner and final decisions will be
determined based on what is best for Freedom as we move forward."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Ending for Sony</HD>
<DH>Patience with its film studio is paying off this summer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a significant, if small, sign of change within Japan's premier
electronics company. Sony Corp. Chairman Nobuyuki Idei not only
showed up for the London opening of "Spider-Man"--unusual enough--but
the stately and reserved executive also mugged for the cameras with
star Tobey Maguire.</LD>
<LD>   Sony, it seems, is no longer embarrassed to own a Hollywood
studio.</LD>
<LD>   Since purchasing the studio in 1989, Sony has been the butt of
jokes, known as much for churning out over-the-top flops as for
profligate spending that forced it to take a $3.2-billion write-off
in 1994, one of the largest losses in Japanese corporate history.</LD>
<TE>   But that was before "Spider-Man," which scored the largest opening
weekend and has blown past $400 million in U.S. ticket sales. A slate
of summer blockbusters have followed, including "Mr. Deeds," "Stuart
Little 2" and "Men in Black II," which opened July 3 and delivered
the biggest Fourth of July box office ever. Coming next month is a
potential rocket blast from hip-hop spy thriller "XXX."</TE>
<TE>   Sony's movie lineup broke all summer records and helped rack up $1
billion in U.S. ticket sales, more than most studios make in a year.
First-quarter earnings are due today, and movie profits this year are
expected to make the studio second only to Sony's successful
PlayStation in importance to the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround underscores Hollywood's fickle nature: Studios are
on top one year and buried the next. The trick is putting together a
consistent lineup from one year to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Sony has had a few hits, but nothing like this. Though it must
prove that it has box-office staying power, its sudden success earns
the studio new cachet in Japan: Sony says that its Hollywood assets
are worth at least $14 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been telling Tokyo this was going to be fine," said Howard
Stringer, chairman and CEO of Sony Corp. of America. "And now we
really are having a banner year. It's hard to argue anymore."</TE>
<TE>   It was beloved Sony co-founder Akio Morita who pioneered the
modern-day marriage of content and technology, a throwback to the
early days of consumer electronics when Thomas Edison couldn't just
invent the phonograph, he needed to supply the recordings to build
consumer demand.</TE>
<TE>   Morita bought CBS Records in 1987 for $2 billion. Two years later,
he approved the $3.4-billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment, considered a stunning overpayment for a company
carrying $1.6 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was a calculated strategy born of past experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Morita believed if they had controlled more content when Sony
launched the Betamax his superior system would have won out over
rival VHS. He was firm in that view," said Peter G. Peterson, a
former Sony board member and Morita confidant.</TE>
<TE>   But the studio heads Morita hired to carry out that vision nearly
destroyed it.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Guber and Jon Peters were two of Hollywood's hottest
commodities when they were hired as co-chairmen of the studio,
shortly after producing "Batman," a $1-billion phenomenon that
reinvented Hollywood's superhero genre. They commanded
multimillion-dollar salaries, a $50-million bonus pool and
participation in any appreciation of the studio's assets, a pittance
of what the team ultimately would cost Sony.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, Sony paid $200 million to buy their
production company, Guber-Peters Entertainment. At the time, the pair
was contracted to Warner Bros. Studio, but promised Sony that the
contract would never be enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Warners thought differently and sued, forcing Sony to pay an
estimated $800-million settlement.</TE>
<TE>   That was only the beginning of a relationship whose excesses have
become Hollywood lore. There were the millions spent renovating the
Columbia back lot to include street facades that would prove useless
because they lacked the cinematic perspective necessary for filming.
Tales abounded about how the pair abused Sony's corporate jet, which
Peters once used to ferry flowers to a girlfriend across the
Atlantic. And then there were some of the most expensive flops in
Hollywood history, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Last Action
Hero."</TE>
<TE>   Sony was ridiculed as a naive foreigner blinded by glamour.</TE>
<TE>   Guber and Peters declined to comment for this story.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1994, Sony had to acknowledge it had been duped,
announcing a $3.2-billion write-off of Hollywood losses.</TE>
<TE>   The movie industry expected the Japanese to abandon their
Hollywood sojourn. Sony did, in fact, consider selling the studio but
held on out of stubborn pride and devotion to Morita, who stepped
down in 1994 after a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   When Idei replaced him as chairman, he cleaned house.</TE>
<TE>   The overriding desire in Tokyo was to hire American managers who
could be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   If they also created hit movies, "that would be the gravy," said
Sony board member Peterson, who was charged with the hiring.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson brought in a new studio chief, John Calley, a former
Warners top executive who at the time was running MGM. A year later,
Stringer--a former president of CBS--was brought in as president of
Sony Corp. of America.</TE>
<TE>   "It took patience," Stringer said. "The suspicion [inside Sony]
was always that the entertainment industry was lying in wait for the
unsuspecting outsider."</TE>
<TE>   For much of this time the studio bled red ink, despite occasional
hits such as "Jerry Maguire," "Air Force One" and "Charlie's Angels."</TE>
<TE>   The dry spell dragged on as Stringer's team struggled to follow
through on projects left behind by the previous regime and formulate
a new strategy. It was years in the making, but soon the studio buzz
was all about a slate of sure-bet films for summer 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about putting a program together," said Amy Pascal, who
took the helm at Columbia Pictures in 1996 and defended the time it
took to turn things around. The deals for "Spider-Man" and the sequel
to "Men in Black" were more difficult to put together than the movies
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Launching the slate would send a powerful signal to Hollywood--and
Wall Street. But it would be an expensive gamble, costing nearly $600
million in film production alone. That's as much as some studios, and
certainly Sony, spends in a year.</TE>
<TE>   To convince Sony's Japanese executives, who had an image of
extravagant studio spenders, Stringer hatched a good-faith deal. If
Sony agreed to fund the summer slate, the studio would slash $150
million in annual overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Network television production was curtailed, and the Culver City
TV production facility was put up for sale. Staff cuts included
eliminating executive positions such as president of Sony Pictures
Entertainment, a job held by Mel Harris.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Stringer eliminated $400 million in annual overhead
throughout Sony America.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a major restructuring out there," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the studio's progress, Sony faces daunting challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's music business is grappling with sagging sales, rampant
Internet piracy and a dearth of new pop music sensations. It's a
struggle to keep the profit margins of Sony's electronics' business
in the mid-single digits as Chinese, Korean and East European
manufacturers copy Sony's components and rush knockoffs to market in
less than six months.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's hope for standing out depends on consumers with high-speed
Internet connections both at home and through their portable Sony
devices. These connections are coming, but dozens of entrepreneurs
and companies who bet on the "broadband" future have run out of cash
waiting for it to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   Sony is trying to fast-forward to that future with video- and
music-on-demand services and other digital offerings such as
EverQuest, which enables hundreds of thousands of subscribers to play
a fantasy computer game together online; Movielink, a joint venture
by Sony and four other Hollywood studios to offer downloadable
movies; and Screenblast, a Web-based service to help consumers create
and share videos and music.</TE>
<TE>   Although the services will work on everyone's gear, the studio
works with Sony's electronics designers in Tokyo and San Jose to
optimize the look and feel of the software on Sony devices such as an
Internet-ready PlayStation 2, the Vaio personal computer and the Clie
hand-held digital assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Among other new projects is a line of cell phones being made
jointly by Sony and Ericsson. The phone's ability to play "Men in
Black II" and "Spider-Man" games and graphics not only sets the
phones apart from the masses but could encourage users to pay to jazz
up their electronic messages with images from Sony movies.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sony America] is the center of content and also the crossroads
of technology," said Stringer, who now has Sony's backing to make new
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The improved dialogue between Sony's entertainment and electronics
divisions also has given Sony new clout on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "They are getting their groove at Sony," said Merrill Lynch
analyst Jessica Reif Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Will it last? That depends. Sony must capitalize on its
PlayStation success by developing more hit games and following this
summer with another round of money-making films, such as sequels to
"Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   "Consistency is what every company strives for," said Joe Roth,
whose Revolution Studios is producing "XXX," with Sony, and who has
been approached to replace Calley when he retires. "Now it's their
job to build off their record."</TE>

<HD>Sale of Vivendi's U.S. Assets Seen</HD>
<DH>Media: The debt-laden firm's new chairman is expected to
spin off its Hollywood movie and music business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's Hollywood executives returned from their first
face-to-face meetings with the new chairman in Paris with one clear
impression: The French want to be out of the American entertainment
business as badly as the Americans want them to leave.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou did not specifically say he planned to
sell the American companies, sources close to the discussions said.
But he left little doubt that Vivendi does not plan to be a long-term
parent company to Universal Studios or Universal Music.</LD>
<LD>   Exactly how and when Vivendi plans to spin off the studio and
music company, and whether they would be a single company or two
entities, are subjects of speculation. Sources close to the
discussions in Paris said the French executives did not discuss
specifics with the American executives.</LD>
<TE>   Stressing that the meetings were collegial and cooperative, the
sources said board members are sorting through their options before
declaring a new strategy for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi stock has fallen 70% this year amid investor concern over
the company's enormous debt load and incoherent strategy. Fourtou was
brought in this month to replace Chairman Jean-Marie Messier, whose
vision of transforming the French water and sewer company into a
global media giant was rapidly sinking the company.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings Monday were to bring Fourtou up to date on Vivendi's
Hollywood operations. The Americans also attended meetings with
Vivendi's bankers.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Fourtou said Vivendi plans further major asset sales
beyond the announced disposal of certain money-losing divisions of
French pay-television company Canal Plus. He did not say what he
plans to put on the auction block. The likely candidates include
Houghton-Mifflin publishing company and Vivendi's 44% stake in French
telecom operator Cegetel, sources close to the board said.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou also said he expects next month to secure an additional
bank loan, estimated at $2 billion to $3 billion, to ease the
company's cash crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi Universal is carrying too much debt," Fourtou said.
"Lowering the debt burden will require significant asset disposals.
However, we do not intend to rush into any actions."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, a frenzy of speculation surrounds who would buy Universal
Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Off-the-cuff remarks by NBC Chief Executive Robert Wright that his
company might be interested in buying or merging with the studio
created a furor at a meeting Wednesday of television journalists in
Pasadena. Network sources later said Wright's comments were
exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Wednesday, Vivendi Universal Entertainment Chairman
Barry Diller, a key executive at the Paris meetings, expressed his
support for Fourtou.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou is "straight, direct [and] has one goal in mind, which is
to stabilize the company financially," said Diller, who spoke to
reporters after his other company, USA Interactive Inc., released its
second-quarter earnings report.</TE>
<TE>   Diller's online commerce company reported improved cash flow and
revenue, primarily because of the strength of its travel operations
and online dating services. Its shares gained $2.28, or about 13%, to
$20.44 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's shares rallied after the announcement, closing at
$16.15, up 85 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>WellPoint Profit Soars 71% as Plan Enrollment Increases</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Second-quarter net income beats expectations.
Acquisitions boost membership 27%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks Inc., the biggest publicly traded Blue
Cross Blue Shield health plan, said Wednesday that second-quarter
profit soared 71% on higher enrollment in its health plans.</LD>
<LD>   The Thousand Oaks-based company said earnings surged to $170.7
million, or $1.12 a share, from $99.9 million, or 75 cents, a year
ago. Analysts were expecting $1.08 on average, according to Thomson
First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Enrollment rose 27% to 13 million, boosted by the company's buying
spree, which have gobbled up Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri,
HealthLink and MethodistCare of Texas. Revenue jumped 37% to $4.2
billion in the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   WellPoint has been aggressive in efforts to stem spiraling
health-care costs, exemplified by its high-profile battle to push
federal regulators to allow Schering-Plough Corp.'s Claritin allergy
drug to be sold over the counter to save costs.</TE>
<TE>   The HMO sector is one of the most prosperous, and industry leaders
are expected to meet estimates on profit goals, said Eric Veiel of
Deutsche Bank, who holds no WellPoint shares.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are good as we expected. This year there have been
less signs of irrational pricing in the marketplace," Veiel said.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint shares rose $5.16 to to $75.76 on the New York Stock
Exchange, before the results were released.</TE>
<TE>   * Unocal Corp. said second-quarter net income fell 54% as oil and
natural gas prices were down from a year ago, but the performance
exceeded Wall Street expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The El Segundo-based oil and gas explorer reported net income of
$114 million, or 46 cents a share, down from $247 million, or 99
cents, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings fell to 55
cents from 92 cents but beat the 51-cent average forecast of analysts
polled by Thomson First Call. Revenue fell 7% to $1.36 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal also said it expects earnings of 45 cents to 55 cents for
the third quarter and $1.70 to $1.90 for the year. Analysts have
forecast 47 cents and $1.65, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   * Fidelity National Financial Inc. of Santa Barbara, the nation's
largest title insurer, reported a 34% rise in second-quarter net
income to $112.3 million, or $1.13 a share. Revenue rose 19% to $1.1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Allergan Inc., the Irvine-based maker of the Botox anti-wrinkle
treatment, posted second-quarter net income of $3.8 million, or 3
cents a share, down 83% from $21.9 million, or 16 cents, a year ago
because of costs to spin off a medical device business, Advanced
Medical Optics Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding those costs, earnings were 45 cents, a penny better than
analysts expected. Revenue rose 14% to $475.7 million, boosted by a
better-than-forecast 48% jump in sales of Botox.</TE>
<TE>   Had it been a separate unit for the entire quarter, Advanced
Medical would have reported earnings of $6.6 million, or 22 cents a
share, down from $12.9 million, or 45 cents a share, last year. Sales
edged down 1% to $137.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Conexant Systems Inc. posted a narrower loss for its third
quarter and said it will cut 400 jobs, or 15% of its work force, to
cut costs and focus its chip business. The Newport Beach company lost
$299.4 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with a loss of $744.9
million, or $3.02, a year ago. Revenue dipped 2.5% to $154 million.
The job cuts will save about $20 million a year, Conexant said.</TE>
<TE>   * Irvine home builder Standard Pacific Corp. posted second-quarter
net income of $26 million, or 81 cents a share, compared to $26.3
million, or 85 cents a share, for the same quarter last year.
Quarterly revenue increased 37% to a record $448 million.</TE>
<TE>   * New Century Financial Corp., an Irvine financial services
company, reported net income of $42.9 million, or $1.46 a share, for
the second quarter, compared with earnings of $9.9 million, or 51
cents a share, for last year's second quarter. Revenue more than
doubled to $140.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Irvine communications chip maker Intersil Corp. reported a
second-quarter net loss of $18.3 million, or 15 cents a share,
contrasted with net income of $1.2 million, or 1 cent a share, for
last year's second quarter. Revenue rose 22% to $144.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Epicor Software Corp. in Irvine reported a net loss of $987,000,
or 2 cents a share, for the second quarter, compared with earnings of
$554,000, or 1 cent a share, for the same period last year. Sales
fell 22% to $36.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   * New Horizons Worldwide Inc., an Anaheim information technology
training company, posted second-quarter net income of $372,000, or 4
cents a share, compared with earnings of $2.1 million, or 20 cents a
share, for last year's second quarter. Revenue fell 19% to $36.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   * Rainbow Technologies Inc., an Irvine developer of security
software products, posted a wider net loss of $44.9 million, or $1.69
a share, for the second quarter, compared with a lost of $2.3
million, or 9 cents a share, for last year's second quarter. The
bigger loss was attributed mainly to one-time charges and write-offs,
mainly for discontinued businesses. Sales fell 7% to $31 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Endocare Inc., an Irvine developer of diagnostic and treatment
tools for cancer, posted second-quarter net income of $1.1 million,
or 5 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of $2.1 million, or 13
cents a share, for last year's second quarter. Sales more than
tripled to $11.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Footwear maker Skechers USA Inc. said second-quarter earnings
jumped 26% to $21.3 million, or 52 cents a share, exceeding analysts'
expectations of 41 cents, and boosted its full-year forecast to
$1.73, 6 cents higher than Wall Street was anticipating.</TE>

<HD>Broadcom Answers Rival's Patent Suit With Its Own Filing on
Infringement</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine communications chip maker Broadcom Corp., accused of
improperly using National Semiconductor Corp.'s patented technology,
filed court papers contending it is the one whose patents were
infringed.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcom, the biggest maker of cable-modem chips, says that
National Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, stole technology
related to ethernet products, according to court documents. Broadcom
made the allegation in a court filing in National Semiconductor's
suit against Broadcom.</LD>
<LD>   In May, National Semiconductor, which makes semiconductors for
cell phones and PCs, filed a federal lawsuit in Sacramento, accusing
Broadcom of making and selling microchips that infringed on its
patents related to networking equipment. Broadcom said it didn't
believe National's patents applied to its current products.</LD>
<TE>   Broadcom is seeking damages and a court order blocking National
Semiconductor from selling any infringing products. Officials
couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom shares rose 25 cents to $19.77, while National
Semiconductor shares rose 56 cents to $20.95, before news of the suit
was released.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With senators working overtime to help solve the world's problems,
sort out the economy's collapse and win elections, it's nice they
found time to hold a reception in the caucus room of the Senate
Office Building for Uga, the white bulldog mascot of the George
Bulldogs' football team.</LD>
<LD>   Uga was flown to Washington on a private jet to meet with 300
Georgia legislators and their staffs. Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) even
rolled around on the floor trying to get Uga to kiss him, according
to Melanie Eversley of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   What a photo op!</LD>
<TE>   Retiring Congressman J.C. Watts, who played quarterback at
Oklahoma, also showed up to see Uga.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't bite me, so I'm happy," said Watts. "I think he
probably thought I'd bite him back, if he did."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is baseball's last 30-game winner?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, those Irish: The Gaelic football team from Roscommon County,
in the Irish midlands, apparently went too far in its drunken
celebration of a championship when they played billiards in the buff.
Stephen Banahan, chairman of the Gaelic Athletics Assn., banned the
entire team.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this is something we have to do for the good of Roscommon
football," he said, adding that Roscommon had been beset by
"exaggerated rumors" about the players' behavior, "and some have
proved to be true."</TE>
<TE>   The spin: Pit bulls have been banned from the 25th World Series of
Dog Shows in Houston. Some dog handlers are disappointed at the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Said Flo Bell, responding to an incident where a woman who owned
four of the dogs was found dead after being attacked, "I don't think
the dogs did anything to her. Maybe they were trying to get her to
respond.... She collapsed and went down. The puncture wounds were
dogs trying to bring her to alert."</TE>
<TE>   Closing in: Ron Gardenhire, manager of the Minnesota Twins, has
been ejected four times this season, enough to bring warnings from
Bob Watson of the commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gardenhire: "I've had so many conversations with Bob Watson
that he's going to give me a red phone."</TE>
<TE>   One for AARP: It was pretty remarkable when Ted Byram bowled a 300
game during league play in Ft. Pierce, Fla. After all, he's 82, but
that's not the remarkable part.</TE>
<TE>   Byram's feat came only 17 days after suffering a stroke that
temporarily left him unable to speak or lift his right arm--his
bowling arm.</TE>
<TE>   "That last ball felt like it weighed 25 pounds," Byram said. "But
it had nothing to do with the stroke. It was nerves."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers, with 31 wins in
1968.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: No one needs an excuse to visit Hawaii, but Alabama
Coach Dennis Franchione has one of the most unique for his football
team.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama is on NCAA probation, so any of his sophomores or juniors
could transfer as late as this summer and be immediately eligible at
another school. Franchione scheduled a game at Hawaii on Nov. 30 in
hopes of keeping them at Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   When he asked for a show of hands about making the trip,
Franchione said, "Before I finished the sentence, every hand was up."</TE>

<HD>Seeking Good Fortune in Del Mar Savings Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Here at The Times we are allowed to sink 6% of our salary into a
401(k) plan with the company adding another 50 cents for every dollar
we contribute, and after doing this now for about 10 or 12 years, the
wife and I probably have enough money in our retirement fund to cover
a good dinner at Denny's--if given the senior discount.</LD>
<LD>   That's why I was here at Del Mar along with 37,284 fans
Wednesday--making it the largest opening day crowd in the meet's
63-year history--obviously everyone coming here in quest of the quick
nest egg to make up for the bad gamble they've taken on the stock
market.</LD>
<LD>   Now I don't recall a single moment in the last 10 to 12 years that
I've been throwing away money in my 401(k) when I actually jumped to
my feet in excitement, or proclaimed myself a winner. In fact I find
it's real hard to jump to my feet for any reason these days without
taking a couple of Advil first.</LD>
<TE>   But at this place there is always that possibility I will feel
young again.</TE>
<TE>   One pick-six ticket paid $1,039,259.20 at Del Mar seven years ago,
which would almost be enough money to keep the wife in shoes for
another month or two.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a single pick-six ticket paid more than $110,000 on 10
occasions at Del Mar, and with Hollywood Park just completing its
meet with a payoff of more than $900,000 for picking six consecutive
winners, one good day like that and I find a dog to kick, and I could
feel what it's like to be Kevin Brown for a day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LIKE THE stock market, I know my limitations, so I chose to
consult with the experts, meeting with Eddie Delahoussaye, Gary
Stevens and the retired Chris McCarron in the Jockey's Room at Del
Mar to start fresh on my new retirement program: "Run You Pig, Run."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been getting killed in the stock market, too," Delahoussaye
cried, as if I could really care, but it did become obvious to me he
has also been seeking alternative ways to set himself up for
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard this story where a lady bought $2,000 worth of Budweiser,
saved the cans and then cashed them in for $72. That sounds like a
good plan to me."</TE>
<TE>   Just what I wanted to hear from the jockey riding my selection in
the second leg of the pick six on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, OK, I'll give you some tips to win the pick six,"
Delahoussaye said. "Bet on anyone wearing pink."</TE>
<TE>   You drink $2,000 worth of Budweiser, and of course you're going to
bet on the pink elephant to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Give me the program," Delahoussaye said as they loaded the horses
into the gate on the TV in front of us for the start of the fourth
race--the first leg in the pick six. "I'll need my glasses, though,
to read this."</TE>
<TE>   Tough to tell the pink horses from the pink elephants, of course,
without glasses. But without his glasses, Delahoussaye still gave it
a try, and pointed to the No. 7 horse in the program, saying it would
win, and it did. Of course, without his glasses, he might have been
trying to point at the No. 6 horse, but I wasn't going to make fun of
Mr. Magoo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EDDIE D, of course, is a Hall of Fame jockey, and considered the
best in the business at coming from behind--I would imagine because
without his glasses he gets lost a lot and then gets real excited
when he finds his way home.</TE>
<TE>   He has won 681 races at Del Mar the last 23 summers, and now
sounds real committed to helping me. "You don't have a chance of
winning the pick six," he said. "If I were you, I'd give me the money
you would bet on the pick six, let me hold it, bury it in my back
yard and dig it up for you when you're ready to call it quits."</TE>
<TE>   Delahoussaye then excused himself to ride Saphir Indien in the
fifth, finishing last. It's a shame he forget to take his glasses
with him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McCARRON WAS much more supportive of my plan to invest 6% of my
salary--as soon as I can convince The Times to also throw in 50 cents
on every dollar I bet--to win the pick six, and enjoy retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bet the pick six 52 weeks a year, I think you'd win."
McCarron, the horse expert, told me this after losing $20 on Omega
Code to win the third race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I put $32 down on the pick six, taking two horses in the fourth,
fifth, sixth and seventh races, and one horse each in the eighth and
ninth. And I almost hit the big one on the very first day of the
meet.</TE>
<TE>   I had the winner in the fourth and just missed on the next five
races--and the pick six payoff of $78,073.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been more disappointing. I could have been in Las
Vegas betting the house on the Dodgers to beat the Padres on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JOE HARPER, Del Mar's top executive, couldn't explain why the
track drew a record crowd--even matched head-to-head for the first
time with a Padre game beginning at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "The silicone and spandex could have been a bigger draw than the
horses," Harper surmised, and I think I know a little about
first-time Lasix users and blinkers when it comes to the sport of
horse racing, but I have no idea how silicone and spandex factor in.
I guess I probably should get out of the press box more often.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TIMES' HANDICAPPER Bob Mieszerski finished Hollywood Park down an
imaginary $165.20. After one day at Del Mar, Misery is another
imaginary $13 in the hole. At this rate, the Times is going to run
out of imaginary money.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Ian:</TE>
<TE>   "Do you consider yourself a journalist? You give Plaschke such a
hard time, but you couldn't come close to filling his shoes."</TE>
<TE>   So you've noticed his big feet, too.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just up from the minors, journeyman Andy Sheets is putting some
much-needed pop in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Sheets hit a three-run home run to highlight a six-run second
inning at Boston, and Tampa Bay's bullpen did not give up a run over
six innings as the Devil Rays beat the Red Sox, 9-5, Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "He's hungry, so naturally I'm going to play him," Devil Ray
Manager Hal McCrae said of Sheets, who was called up from triple-A
Durham on Saturday. "We don't have enough wins, and he's a hungry
player. He's trying to climb and I need climbers at this point."</LD>
<TE>   Sheets also had a single and a double as the Devil Rays won their
second in a row against Boston after dropping their first eight
against the Red Sox this season, including a 22-4 loss in the first
game of a doubleheader Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay starter Joe Kennedy lasted only three innings, giving up
nine hits and five runs.</TE>
<TE>   But Jesus Colome (2-5) pitched three hitless innings in relief for
the victory, and Victor Zambrano gave up one hit over the last three
innings for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Castillo (5-11), who made his first relief appearance for
Boston on Sunday against the New York Yankees, lasted only 1 2/3
innings and lost his fifth consecutive decision. In four starts this
month, he has given up 16 earned runs in 18 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who lost his fifth consecutive decision and hasn't won
since June 12, may be dropped from the starting rotation, Manager
Grady Little suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "The way things have been going with Frankie, a change may be in
order and we are going to look into that over the next couple of
days," Little said.</TE>
<TE>   New York 14, Cleveland 7--Jason Giambi homered off the top of the
foul pole in right field at Cleveland, and tied a Yankee record by
scoring five runs.</TE>
<TE>   New York led, 10-0, after two innings and made things easy for
David Wells (11-5), who wasn't sharp but didn't have to be.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi matched the club mark for runs, achieved 14 times by 11
players. He had four hits and drove in three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Chicago 1--David Ortiz hit a three-run homer and
Torii Hunter had three hits to lift the Twins at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Mientkiewicz and Bobby Kielty also homered for the Twins, who
opened a 14-game lead in the American League Central. Chicago, which
stranded 12 runners, has lost 15 of 21.</TE>
<TE>   Twin starter Kyle Lohse (10-5) gave up eight hits in his longest
outing this season.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Baltimore 2--Chris Carpenter (4-1) won his fourth
consecutive decision, and Carlos Delgado hit the first of three
consecutive run-scoring singles in the eighth inning at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Dewayne Wise hit his first major league homer for the Blue Jays,
who have won 10 of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto improved to 4-0 against Baltimore by sweeping the
rain-shortened two-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Kansas City 0--Jose Lima (2-4) gave up two hits in
seven innings at Detroit to win for the first time since April 16 in
the fastest nine-inning game in the major leagues--1 hour 41
minutes--in 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta beat San Diego, 4-3, in 1:39 on Sept. 30, 1984.</TE>

<HD>Rogers Stops Mariners, 4-3</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Kenny Rogers, starting a day after turning down a trade to
Cincinnati, pitched eight effective innings, and the Texas Rangers
posted a rare victory over the Seattle Mariners, 4-3, Wednesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   The Rangers were set to send Rogers to the Reds this week for
three minor leaguers, but the left-hander cited family concerns and
invoked his no-trade clause.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle had shown interest in acquiring Rogers before Texas worked
out the deal with Cincinnati. The Rangers were unwilling to pick up
any part of Rogers' salary in a deal with the Mariners, who have said
they don't want to go over their $90-million payroll.</LD>
<TE>   Rogers (11-5) won for the second time at Safeco Field in his
fourth start against the Mariners this season. He beat them, 9-0,
with a five-hitter April 19.</TE>
<TE>   In his four starts against Seattle this season, Rogers is 2-0 with
an 1.50 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers gave up three runs--two earned--seven hits and one walk.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers beat the Mariners for the second time in 11 games in
2002. They're 7-24 against Seattle in the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Catalanotto, who was batting .179 in his previous 15 games,
accounted for three of the Rangers' runs. He homered on the second
pitch of the game and had a two-run single in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers made it 2-0 in the third against Freddy Garcia (11-7)
on a walk to Kevin Mench, Ruben Rivera's sacrifice and two wild
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia gave up four runs, six hits and four walks, and had three
wild pitches in 6 1/3 innings.</TE>

<HD>Record Attendance for Del Mar Opener</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Crowd of 37,284 is largest for first day and
is second biggest at track behind 1996 race featuring Cigar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Rick Baedeker may have been on to something. When Hollywood Park's
meet closed on Sunday, its on-track attendance up by more than 9%
from the year before, the president of the Inglewood track predicted
that the increased interest would carry over to Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   For a day--Wednesday's season opener--Baedeker has been as right
as the rain that never comes to Del Mar. Only Cigar, on the day he
was unable to extend his 16-race winning streak in 1996, has drawn a
bigger crowd to the seaside track. Wednesday's turnout, in 79-degree
weather, was 37,284, second highest in track history and breaking the
count of 34,697 for the first day in 1994. The overall record is
still the 44,181 horseplayers who came the day Dare And Go beat Cigar
six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Del Mar runs only seven weeks a year, from mid-July into early
September, and the San Diego area, not jaded by the grind-it-out
style of Santa Anita and Hollywood Park to the north, welcomes the
game the way the general public was drawn to horse racing decades
ago. At Del Mar, less is more.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Harper, the Del Mar president, thought the track would break
the 30,000 mark Wednesday, but he was surprised at the record. For
the first time, Del Mar was bucking a San Diego Padres' afternoon
home game, where 26,779 showed up at Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "This was great," Harper said. "It's wonderful to do this kind of
business. The people were ready for Del Mar, they always are. In
particular, we got a lot of advance publicity from the electronic
media. It was a very smooth opening."</TE>
<TE>   For this opener, the fans were treated to some more first-day
magic by Laffit Pincay, and the resurgent Pat Valenzuela's first
stakes win here since 1996. Pincay, 55, won three races in the
inaugural last year, and another triple Wednesday included a
front-running, three-quarter-length win aboard Rock Opera in the
first division of the Oceanside Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   About 90 minutes later, Valenzuela, who battled back from one more
in a string of substance-abuse suspensions to become the leading
rider at Hollywood Park, brought True Phenomenon from out of the pack
for a one-length win in the other half of the Oceanside.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay, who finished third in the Hollywood standings, pushed his
record total to 9,392 wins in his career. Beginning his 27th season
here--which will be one more than Bill Shoemaker when it's
over--Pincay increased his Del Mar win total to 982, which is well
ahead of the retired Shoemaker and Chris McCarron, who are second and
third on the list, and about 300 more than Eddie Delahoussaye, who's
No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay's stakes win, his first in the Oceanside since 1987, was
his 95th at Del Mar. McCarron, who won 134 stakes here, is still well
ahead on that tally.</TE>
<TE>   "He's getting better all the time, and he was just about perfect
today," Pincay said of Rock Opera, who is trained by Clifford Sise
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Rock Opera has won three of four starts, all with Pincay on his
back, and in his first stakes start he ran a mile on grass in 1:34,
breaking by a fifth of a second the Oceanside record that was set by
Prince Bobby B. in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood in June, Rock Opera had won despite being only 70%,
according to Sise. Blood work after the race showed that the
3-year-old gelding was suffering from a virus.</TE>
<TE>   "He jumped right out of there," Pincay said of Wednesday's race.
"He took the turns right this time. He was getting out on the turns
before. I think that's because he's still learning."</TE>
<TE>   The third choice, Rock Opera paid $7.20 to win. Johar was second
and favored Mountain Rage ran third. True Phenomenon, winning his
division in 1:34 2/5, paid $13.20. Dream Machine finished second,
Diamond Hope was third and favored Mutinyonthebounty ran sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "That felt great," said the 39-year-old Valenzuela, who hadn't
ridden at Del Mar since 1997. "It's great to be back at Del Mar.
Everybody has welcomed me with open arms. The last time this horse
ran [a last-place finish in a six-horse field on the main track in
the Affirmed Handicap on June 23], he didn't handle the dirt too
well. Today [trainer Bobby Frankel] had him ready to roll and he
handled the grass great. I worked him to the outside and he fired."</TE>

<HD>Duke of Flatbush Returns Home</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Snider goes back to Brooklyn, where he ruled
center field for the Dodgers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE GERGEN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing in a ballpark he hadn't seen until Wednesday, wearing the
jersey of a team that didn't exist before last summer, Edwin Donald
Snider said it was nice to be back home. Although the site was
KeySpan Park, not Ebbets Field, and the inscription on the uniform
shirt said Cyclones, not Dodgers, the presence of the erstwhile Duke
of Flatbush on a Brooklyn diamond was cause for the man and the
borough's older baseball fans to smile. Forty-five years is a long
time to frown.</LD>
<LD>   When Walter O'Malley moved the Dodgers to California after the
1957 season, it should have represented a homecoming for the great
center fielder who was born and raised in the Los Angeles area. But
the new ballpark--the ill-shaped Coliseum--had godawful dimensions
for a left-handed power hitter, his knees hurt and relationships he
had developed during his first 11 years in the major leagues were
permanently ruptured. The franchise flourished financially and he
even earned a championship ring in the 1959 World Series, but the
player and his feelings for the sport were never the same.</LD>
<TE>   "Baseball-wise, I was born in Brooklyn," he said. "Brooklyn was my
baseball home." He recalled the house he rented on Marine Avenue in
Bay Ridge. The Duke and his wife cruised around the old neighborhood
in February while they were in New York for the opening of the Hall
of Fame's traveling show at the Museum of Natural History. But they
didn't venture anywhere near the location of Ebbets Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a picture taken of me jumping up against a wall [at the
Ebbets Field Apartments] in my sports coat many years ago while I was
broadcasting for the Montreal Expos," Snider recalled. "I won't go
back."</TE>
<TE>   But the thought of a professional team reviving the great Brooklyn
baseball tradition intrigued him. And so he found himself Wednesday
on Surf Avenue in Coney Island accepting a Cyclones' jersey from Jeff
Wilpon in the Brooklyn Baseball Gallery and throwing out the first
ball before the Mets' Class-A affiliate played the Staten Island
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring memorabilia collected by the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of
Fame during the last 25 years and a timeline created by the Brooklyn
Historical Society, the Gallery showcases uniforms and pictures
associated with the Dodgers and their NL rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items showcased was the road jersey worn by Johnny
Podres when he shut out the Yankees in Game 7 of the 1955 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, Podres was standing nearby to offer an explanation of why
the uniform top looked so short. "I took that shirt home [to upstate
New York] after the World Series," he said, "and gave it to my
brothers. They were only this high at the time. It went down to their
knees. So they cut it in half."</TE>
<TE>   Like Snider, Al Gionfriddo came all the way from California. He
did not come empty-handed. He brought the spikes he wore in the 1947
World Series when he pinch-ran for Carl Furillo, who drew a walk
after Bill Bevens of the Yankees retired 26 batters without yielding
a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Gionfriddo stole second base, Bevens walked Pete Reiser and Cookie
Lavagetto doubled off the right-field wall at Ebbets Field, turning a
potentially historic occasion into a stunning Dodgers' victory.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the 5-foot-6 1/2 Gionfriddo was more renowned for his
glove, the one with which he made the famous grab of a Joe DiMaggio
drive in front of the left-centerfield bullpen at Yankee Stadium in
the same series.</TE>
<TE>   The man proudly confided that when the two appeared at a banquet
in Albany that winter, DiMaggio told the audience, "Look at this man.
Do any of you think at his size he should be in the big leagues? He
had to give 110% to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Branca and Gene Hermanski also came to honor Snider, who had
a forgettable turn with New York's expansion club in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have liked to have a say when the Dodgers sold me to the
Mets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mets lost 120 games the year before. I helped them a lot. We
only lost 111. It was hard to get used to that. And my knee was so
bad I couldn't move. But I had four kids in school and I couldn't
retire."</TE>
<TE>   At 75, the Duke spends much of his time now watching his eight
grandchildren, one of whom--Jordan Michael Snider--batted .500 as a
high school freshman last year. After he had bypass surgery in 1987,
the doctor told him he had 10 good years left. "When the time was
up," he noted, "I called him to renegotiate. I said I'd like another
10."</TE>
<TE>   He's making the most of it, which was cause for a celebration in
Brooklyn.</TE>

<HD>Els Made It Easy to Enjoy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernie Els is known as the Big Easy because of a 6-foot-4 frame, a
fluid swing and a smile that comes easily.</LD>
<LD>   There was nothing easy about his British Open victory at Muirfield
in Scotland. He had to survive some erratic play near the end of the
final round--he double-bogeyed the 16th hole--and then he had to
survive a four-way playoff.</LD>
<LD>   However, Els appeared unrattled through it all--even when he put
his approach shot on the fifth and final playoff hole in a greenside
bunker. He hit out of the bunker to within five feet of the pin, made
the par putt and walked off with the silver Claret Jug.</LD>
<TE>   He made it appear easy, even though it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Els is taking this week off but has committed to play in the
International at Castle Rock, Colo., next week.</TE>
<TE>   He won the International two years ago and is the tournament's
leading money winner with $1,259,989.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, according to the Associated Press, won't play again
until the Buick Open Aug. 8-11 at Gland Blanc, Mich. The PGA
Championship is the following week at Hazeltine in Chaska, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Second Best</TE>
<TE>   Despite making some bad decisions, Frenchman Thomas Levet, who
came into the Open ranked 134th in the world, won over a lot of fans.
He not only took Els to a fifth sudden-death playoff hole, he also
lost gracefully.</TE>
<TE>   ABC announcers Curtis Strange and Mike Tirico were correct when
they questioned why Levet kept insisting on using a driver off the
tee instead of trying to protect his lead in the playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Levet put his final two tee shots into the hay, costing himself a
stroke on each hole and opening the door for Els.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as painful to watch as Frenchman Jean Van de Velde's
triple-bogey meltdown on the 18th hole at the 1999 British Open at
Carnoustie, but it wasn't pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   However, what was fun to watch was Levet's unwavering enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   He played to the crowd as he walked toward the final green, trying
to get them to cheer even louder.</TE>
<TE>   And he seemed to be genuinely happy for Els, even hoisting him in
the air.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Levet saw that as a photo opportunity, but let's hope not.</TE>
<TE>   "Ernie deserved it," Levet said. "He's a great champion, and he
played well."</TE>
<TE>   As for finishing second, he said, "Wouldn't you take second place
at the Open every year? I know I would."</TE>
<TE>   That's a refreshing outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Levet contributed to making it a memorable British Open, even with
Woods out of contention after an 81 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Classy Moment</TE>
<TE>   Woods did a lot to win over fans with what he did on Saturday. No,
it wasn't his 81. It was the way he handled it.</TE>
<TE>   Woods went on camera right after his round and made no excuses. He
didn't complain about the wind, rain and terrible conditions, and
when asked if his back was bothering him, he said no, his back was
fine.</TE>
<TE>   He showed a lot of class.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Planning</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, the powers that be in golf learned an important lesson
Sunday--if you have a four-way playoff, put everybody in one
foursome.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Tirico and Strange were quick to criticize the two-and-two
format, and their criticism was justified. It was confusing and hard
to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Having all four golfers play together would have been much easier
to follow, and much more dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   Golf Everywhere</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend was a big one for golf. Besides the British Open on
ABC, there was the B.C. Open on the Golf Channel, an LPGA tournament
on ESPN2, the Senior SBC Open on CBS, the American Century celebrity
tournament at Lake Tahoe on NBC and the Michael Douglas and Friends
celebrity tournament, taped at Ojai, on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   The British Open, of course, had the highest ratings, getting a
4.1 in Los Angeles Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Douglas tournament, which had the Open as a lead-in on Sunday,
was the second most-watched tournament in L.A., getting a 2.3, its
highest rating ever.</TE>
<TE>   Calm After Storm</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC has the Senior British Open and the top women golfers
will be playing in the Big Apple Classic on NBC, this is somewhat of
an off weekend for golf.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Duffy Waldorf, the John Deere Classic on CBS doesn't have
much of a field.</TE>
<TE>   Battle at Bighorn</TE>
<TE>   Things pick up on Monday, when ABC will televise the Battle at
Bighorn from Palm Desert at 5 p.m. Sergio Garcia and Lee Trevino will
take on Woods and Jack Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   This ends a three-year run of ABC Monday night golf at Bighorn.
The event is expected to move to Twin Bridges in Rancho Santa Fe next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night golf started four years ago as the "Shootout at
Sherwood," when Woods beat David Duval at Sherwood Country Club in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The announcers Monday will be Al Michaels, Tirico, Strange and
"Monday Night Football" sideline reporter Melissa Stark.</TE>
<TE>   More Woods</TE>
<TE>   Southern California golf fans can look forward to seeing Woods
play at least once and possibly twice more before the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to play in the Skins Game on Thanksgiving weekend
(Nov. 30-Dec. 1) at Landmark Golf Club in Indio, and he will be the
host for the Target World Challenge presented by Williams Dec. 2-8 at
Sherwood.</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for Duval to play in the Sherwood event. He wants to
cut back on his off-season schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Charity Tournaments</TE>
<TE>   The fifth Heads Up Youth Foundation charity tournament will be
held Monday at Coto de Caza in southern Orange County. Channel 7
sportscaster Rob Fukuzaki, the chairman and president of the
foundation, will serve as host of the tournament. Details: (310)
768-1553.... Fox Sports Net's ninth charity tournament at Lakeside
Golf Course in Toluca Lake is also Monday. The tournament benefits
Special Olympics. Last year the tournament raised $110,000.... The
Lakers' 13th charity tournament will be held Aug. 26 at Wilshire
Country Club. This tournament benefits the Laker Youth Foundation.
Details: (310) 426-6026.</TE>
<TE>   Warburg Cup</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer led a final-day charge a year ago and hopes to do so
again when he captains the U.S. against the Rest of the World,
captained by Gary Player, in the second UBS Warburg Cup Nov. 15-17 at
the Seaside Course at Sea Island, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer defeated Player in a singles match the final day to lead
the U.S. to a 12 1/2-11 1/2 victory in the Ryder Cup-style match for
players 40 and up.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Faldo, who will play for the Rest of the World again, said
the inaugural match was great fun, except for the final day.</TE>
<TE>   "Our captain [Player] let us down," he said jokingly. "We thought
we had a lock there. Arnold came in with hard-luck stories saying he
couldn't hit it or get the ball airborne. Then he goes out and beats
Gary, 2 and 1."</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys and Pars</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Merrins, longtime pro at Bel-Air Country Club, has been
named tournament chairman of the first World Club Championship, to be
held Oct. 2-4 at the new Club at Nine Bridges on Jeju Island in South
Korea.... Dottie Pepper will take the rest of the year off because of
pain in her left shoulder, which was operated on in March. Pepper has
played in only one tournament this season, and she failed to make the
cut.... The worldwide publicity generated by the Winter Olympics has
made Park City, Utah, one of the most popular destinations for
Southern California residents. A leading attraction for golfers is
Promontory, a new golf community featuring an 18-hole, Pete
Dye-designed championship course, which is scheduled to open on Labor
Day.... Final shot: Woods, who has never finished second in a major,
was asked about Nicklaus' record of 19 second-place finishes in the
majors. "I don't want that one," he said.</TE>

<LD>Although she is a filly taking on six males, Nadia holds a distinct
class edge in the $64,000 Kobuk King, today's feature at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum and trained by Neil Drysdale,
the 4-year-old daughter of Nashwan makes her U.S. debut and her first
start since Oct. 7 in the 1 3/8 mile turf race.</LD>
<LD>   An English-bred, Nadia, who will race on Lasix for the first time
this afternoon, had two wins and two seconds in six races in France.
She was good enough to win a Group I at Longchamp as a 3-year-old and
was second in the French Oaks three weeks later.</LD>
<TE>   Facing a field in which two of the entrants--Sumati and
Komistar--are entered for a $62,500 claiming tag, Nadia should fire
off the bench and she has a history of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   She was a winner in her first start on Nov. 15, 2000, then
returned after five months on the sidelines to run second in a Group
III at Saint-Cloud. Corey Nakatani, recently returned to action after
being injured in a spill early in the meet at Hollywood Park, has the
mount on the chestnut filly, who will break from the rail, an
advantage going 11 furlongs on the Del Mar turf.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Saratoga, some promising 2-year-olds will get
together in the $150,000 Sanford Stakes at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   A Grade II, the Sanford attracted recent first-out maiden winners
Run Production, Title Contender, Wildcat Heir and Spite The Devil
along with stakes winners Posse, Whywhywhy and Hear No Evil.</TE>
<TE>   Four races earlier, Svea Dahl will make her debut for trainer
Bruce Levine and owner Roddy Valente after being claimed for $62,500
at Hollywood Park on June 26.</TE>
<TE>   The trainer-owner combination has had success in the past claiming
horses in California, then winning in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Del Mar's third race--which kicks off the pick
six--drew a full field of well-matched 3-year-old fillies running for
a $20,000 claiming price.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Doug O'Neill. The trainer of Hollywood Gold Cup winner
Sky Jack had a strong finish at Hollywood Park and wound up second to
Bobby Frankel in the standings with 18 victories.</TE>

<HD>Kings Trade for Rasmussen</HD>
<DH>Hockey: They send Mair and fifth-round pick in 2003 to
Sabres for forward who has yet to meet expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings addressed a need for speed and size Wednesday by acquiring
forward Erik Rasmussen from the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for
forward Adam Mair and a fifth-round pick in the 2003 NHL entry draft.</LD>
<LD>   Rasmussen, a physical player who led Buffalo in hits over the last
two seasons, said he welcomed the opportunity to play with a new team
after failing to live up to expectations with the Sabres, who drafted
him in the first round (seventh overall) in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very excited about the trade," he said. "I have a chance to
hopefully play a different role.... The West Coast teams seem to
skate hard at all times. It will be an interesting style of hockey
for me."</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Dave Taylor said the Kings hope to tap into
Rasmussen's offensive potential. He scored 31 goals in two seasons at
the University of Minnesota but had only 33 goals in five seasons
with the Sabres playing mostly on the third or fourth line.</TE>
<TE>   "He has not been given a lot of offensive opportunities," Taylor
said. "He may have the ability to develop into a power forward who
can put the puck in the net. If he gets on a line with [Jason]
Allison or [Bryan] Smolinski, guys who can move the puck, with his
size and strength he can be effective.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has the [potential] to play among our top six
forwards, and at the very least is an excellent third-line player."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3, 208-pound Rasmussen also brings an aggressive style
of play. He led the Sabres in hits with 207 in 2000-01 and was second
on the team with 164 last season.</TE>
<TE>   "He skates very well and he likes to get in and play a very
physical style," Taylor said. "He's very effective on the forecheck
and able to punish opposing defenders."</TE>
<TE>   Rasmussen, 25, has one year left on a two-year contract paying
$1.1 million per season, with an option for the 2003-04 season.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged falling short of expectations in Buffalo, where he
became the target of media criticism. He has been bothered by
shoulder problems the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody, including myself, expected more from me," he
said. "If there was anything negative written about me, I earned it.
It's just a situation where [the Sabres] are going in a different
direction now."</TE>
<TE>   Rasmussen played in 69 games last season and had eight goals, 11
assists and 34 penalty minutes. His best season was in 2000-01, when
he had 12 goals and 19 assists, and played in all 82 games. He helped
the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals in 1999 and the Eastern
Conference finals in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Though excited, Rasmussen said he was a little nervous about
leaving the relative calm of Buffalo for the fast lane of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a quite a culture shock," he said. "I'm not big on
traffic, but I'll try to get used to it."</TE>
<TE>   Mair, 23, played in 18 games for the Kings last season, recording
one goal and one assist. He was suspended for 10 games for leaving
the bench to join a fight on the ice at Ottawa in December.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks signed goalie J.F. Damphousse and right wing Rob
Valicevic to one-year contracts. Damphousse, acquired in the deal
that brought Petr Sykora to the Ducks three weeks ago, played in six
games with the New Jersey Devils last season. Valicevic played 17
games with the Kings last season.</TE>

<HD>Both Sides Call Labor Meeting Constructive</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>

<LD>Amid positive overtones and defused rhetoric, lawyers for the
baseball owners and players agreed Wednesday that the resumption of
collective bargaining negotiations in New York had produced a
constructive exchange of ideas on how to bridge their differences on
the key issue of revenue sharing among the clubs.</LD>
<LD>   "It was time well spent in terms of the ultimate goal of the
process," Rob Manfred, management's lead lawyer, said. "We had a
productive exchange of ideas. The process is going the way you would
want it to go right now."</LD>
<LD>   Union lawyer Steve Fehr, the brother of Executive Director Don
Fehr, said there were "positive vibrations"--an extension of Friday's
talks about revenue sharing.</LD>
<TE>   "We were talking about things that mattered, and it was a good
discussion," Fehr said.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed that if the sides can reach agreement on revenue
sharing, with the final figure satisfying the owners, there is an
increased possibility of an agreement on the more contentious issue
of a luxury tax on high payrolls--which could then, perhaps, be
graduated in at thresholds less onerous to the union than what the
owners initially proposed: a 50% tax on the portions of payroll above
$98 million, which the union considers tantamount to a salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   The revenue-sharing proposals find the sides separated by only $70
million--the owners at $298 million and the players at $228
million--but there are ancillary elements of disagreement, including
method of distribution and amount of the commissioner's proposed
discretionary fund, that are part of the revenue-sharing package.</TE>
<TE>   The sides also discussed deferred compensation funding and player
medical issues Wednesday, and the talks are scheduled to continue
today and Friday.</TE>

<TE>   A federal judge in New York scheduled an Oct. 11 conference for
the racketeering suit filed last week against baseball Commissioner
Bud Selig and former Montreal Expo owner Jeffrey Loria, now owner of
the Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in Miami by unhappy Canadian investors who
accused Selig, Loria and their staffs of illegal conduct that
"effectively destroyed the economic viability of baseball in
Montreal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams' daughter disputed allegations that she harassed her
father's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell, feuding with her half brother and half
sister over the remains of their father, said she called attorney
Eric Abel one day after Williams' death simply to find out what
happened to her father's body.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams died July 5 and his body was sent to be frozen at
Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona, under the orders of John
Henry Williams and Claudia Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell denied the allegation Abel made in an affidavit filed
Tuesday that she left him a threatening message. Abel did not
immediately return a message seeking comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia and John Henry Williams, in a motion filed Tuesday, asked
the court to stop Ferrell from "harassing and attempting to
intimidate witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed pitcher Al Leiter and the New York Mets agreed to an
$18-million, two-year contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets, who have climbed back into the National League wild-card
race with a recent surge, ended trade speculation surrounding Leiter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit put shortstop Ramon Santiago on the disabled list after he
had surgery for a fractured right wrist. He is expected to sit out
from four to six weeks....Boston pitcher Dustin Hermanson went back
on the disabled list, five days after he was activated. The
right-hander had fluid caused by a staph infection drained from his
left elbow. He had not pitched since April 3 because of a strained
groin.</TE>

<LD>Trainer Harry Nelson, who is winning at about a 25% clip at the meet,
will try to continue his hot streak this evening.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson, who won four races last weekend, will send out Cat Speed,
a 2-year-old Chicks Beduino filly, against six others in the fifth, a
$10,850 allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Harold Phenix, Cat Speed was nearly 42-1 when she broke
her maiden in her debut May 24 and has been second in a Kindergarten
Futurity trial and a troubled fifth in a stakes on the California
Champions night June 22.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Bautista will ride the California-bred for the first time
tonight and she'll be opposed by, among others, recent maiden winners
Shy Anns Trust, Rock N Fastball and Hrh Princess Royal.</TE>
<TE>   Two races later, Best To Be First, who was second to the
Nelson-trained Mountain Snow in an allowance contest June 1, heads a
field of seven 3-year-old fillies going 350 yards in a $12,850
allowance.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Gonna Get A Ticket. 2. Shagin Dash. 3. Moved. 4.
Dedicated Diplomat. 5. Cat Speed. 6. Drivers Seat. 7. First Down
Kate. 8. Hot Saki.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Gonna Get A Ticket in the first, use Shagin Dash and
Nino Pancho in the second, Moved, Lets Talk Turkey and Pritzi Too in
the third and Ryans Ridge, Toll Bar and Dedicated Diplomat in the
fourth.</TE>

<HD>Collins Signs Extension With Giants</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins through the 2004
season, agreeing to a two-year contract extension Wednesday, less
than 24 hours before the start of training camp.</LD>
<LD>   Collins, who would have become a free agent after this season,
will earn $15.4 million over the next three seasons. The deal will
create enough salary cap room to enable the Giants to re-sign backup
quarterback Jason Garrett.</LD>
<LD>   Collins, who led the Giants to the Super Bowl in the 2000 season,
would have earned $4 million this season in the final year of a
four-year, $16-million contract.</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the extension, Collins will receive a $5.85-million
signing bonus, but his salary this year will drop to $650,000. Over
the next two years, he will earn a combined $8 million to $9 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited," said Collins, who has thrown every pass for the
Giants over the last two seasons. "I want to be here.... I didn't
want to go through this season as a lame-duck quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Steeler defensive end Aaron Smith avoided a threatened
holdout, reaching terms on a five-year contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who had eight sacks last season as a pass-rushing end in
the Steelers' 3-4 alignment, will play this season under the
$1.227-million offer tendered him in February.</TE>
<TE>   His $24-million, five-year extension kicks in next season. The
contract includes a $5.5-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First-round draft choice Marc Colombo agreed to a five-year,
$5.6-million contract with the Chicago Bears. The deal includes a
$3.1-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Colombo, a 6-foot-7, 320-pound tackle from Boston College, will
compete with Bernard Robertson for the starting spot at left tackle.
Colombo was selected 29th overall in April's draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans Saint cornerback Kevin Mathis, trying to return from a
neck injury, was cut after failing a physical.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis injured his neck making a tackle Dec. 30 against
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, acquired by New Orleans in a trade with the Dallas Cowboys
before the 2000 season, had 166 tackles in 30 games with the Saints.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis Colt running back Edgerrin James was fined $500 at
Fort Myers, Fla., and his driver's license was suspended for a month
for speeding in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   James was caught driving at 111 mph in a 60-mph zone May 8 in
Immokalee, about 125 miles southeast of Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ariko Iso was hired by the Steelers as an assistant athletic
trainer, making her the NFL's first full-time female trainer.</TE>
<TE>   Iso spent the last five seasons as the head football trainer at
Portland State. She gained NFL experience by working as an intern at
the Steelers' last two training camps.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rich Aurilia and Kirk Rueter each ended slumps and gave San Francisco
a lift in the process.</LD>
<LD>   Aurilia homered and Rueter carried a shutout into the eighth
inning as the Giants defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 6-4, Wednesday
at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants moved back into second place in the National League
West, a half-game ahead of the Dodgers. The Central-leading Cardinals
had their three-game winning streak ended.</LD>
<TE>   Rueter (8-6) gave up two runs--both unearned--and six hits over 7
1/3 innings. He walked none and won for the first time since June 4,
nine starts ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really got discouraged because I was keeping the team in
the game and we won a lot of my no decisions," Rueter said. "I've
been on the other side where I've pitched badly and won."</TE>
<TE>   Rueter improved to 9-3 in 21 outings against the Cardinals. He
hasn't lost to St. Louis since July 22, 1998, at Candlestick Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I did before," he said. "I was just trying to get
groundballs."</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia had four hits in 23 previous at bats against Benes before
going two for two with a walk against the right-hander.</TE>
<TE>   "I got into some bad habits and it took me a long time to get out
of it," Aurilia said. "I'm feeling better at the plate and hitting
the ball harder."</TE>
<TE>   Robb Nen came in with nobody out and two on in the ninth and got
his 27th save. Nen gave up a two-run single to Mike Matheny.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Benes (0-3) went a season-high 4 2/3 innings, giving up two
runs--one earned--and four hits. He walked two and struck out five.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, New York 1--Vladimir Guerrero threw out the potential
tying run at the plate in the seventh inning, and rookie Brad
Wilkerson hit a two-run homer at New York to help the Expos end a
five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Vazquez (8-6) gave up five hits over six innings to stop
the streaking Mets. New York lost for only the third time in 11
games, falling five games behind NL wild-card leader San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Playing without injured All-Star second baseman Jose Vidro and
slumping slugger Cliff Floyd, the fading Expos avoided dropping three
games under .500 for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 10, Pittsburgh 5--Todd Walker hit a grand slam and
Brandon Larson had a three-run homer at Cincinnati, and the Reds
rallied behind their newest pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Moehler (1-0), who drove down Interstate 75 from Detroit
after the Reds traded for him on Tuesday, got rocked in his first
inning, but he left with an 8-4 lead after giving up nine hits and
four runs in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 10, Florida 0--Damian Moss gave up one hit in seven
innings at Miami and Wes Helms drove in three runs with a career-high
four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's only hit was by Derrek Lee, who grounded a single past
third baseman Vinny Castilla leading off the fifth. Lee was erased on
a double play.</TE>
<TE>   Moss (6-4) struck out four and walked three. The Australian
left-hander drove in a run with a double, the first extra-base hit of
his career, hiking his career average to .069.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Blanco hit a three-run homer to cap a six-run first inning,
and Andruw Jones added a two-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Chicago 2--Brett Myers was marvelous in his major
league debut, giving up two hits in eight innings at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Myers, who outpitched fellow first-round pick Mark Prior in a
meeting of 21-year-old rookies at windy Wrigley Field, left with a
4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa hit his 31st homer with two out in the ninth against
Jose Mesa, who then gave up singles to Fred McGriff and Moises Alou
before striking out Corey Patterson for his 27th save.</TE>
<TE>   Myers (1-0) gave up a third-inning homer to Mark Bellhorn, then
retired 14 batters in a row before Todd Hundley hit a one-out double
in the eighth. He struck out five and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 12, Houston 8--Brewer Manager Jerry Royster and reliever
Mike DeJean got into a heated argument on the mound in the ninth
inning at Houston, moments before the team ended a nine-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   After Craig Biggio had a run-scoring grounder and Lance Berkman
singled to load the bases with one out in the ninth, Royster went out
to pull DeJean.</TE>
<TE>   The manager and pitcher went face to face for about 30 seconds
before DeJean left. Luis Vizcaino came in and closed for his second
save.</TE>
<TE>   Richie Sexson went four for four and drove in four runs for
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Sexson hit his 22nd homer and tied a career high for hits to help
the Brewers end their longest skid this season.</TE>
<TE>   Berkman hit his league-leading 31st home run.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 7, Colorado 1--Miguel Batista threw a three-hitter in his
first complete game in three seasons, and the Diamondbacks completed
a three-game sweep of the Rockies at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Batista (5-7) had been 0-4 in his previous five starts since
winning June 12. He shut out the Rockies after Todd Helton's two-out
home run in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Batista struck out seven and walked one in his third career
complete game and first since June 5, 1999, for Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   David Dellucci hit a 428-foot home run to lead off the fifth
against starter Shawn Chacon (5-7). Dellucci also had a run-scoring
triple to go 5 for 8 in his last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Womack, in a squeeze for playing time in Arizona's crowded
infield since the return of Matt Williams, was 3 for 4 with a double
and a two-run triple.</TE>

<HD>Argentina May Keep the Embattled Bielsa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentina Coach Marcelo Bielsa, who built the team that went into the
Korea/Japan '02 World Cup as favorite only to be knocked out in the
first round, has been offered the chance to keep his job.</LD>
<LD>   Bielsa, who has been in seclusion at his home in Rosario,
Argentina, since the World Cup ended, received potentially good news
Wednesday when Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Football
Assn. (AFA) and a FIFA vice president, said he will ask Bielsa to
stay in charge.</LD>
<LD>   The coach also has received the backing of such influential
players as Gabriel Batistuta, Juan Sebastian Veron and Ariel Ortega.</LD>
<TE>   "Three [World Cup] matches must not be allowed to wipe out
everything he did in four years," Veron told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina defeated Nigeria in its opening game but then lost to
England and Sweden and was ousted.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Jose Peckerman, the man most Argentine fans wanted to
see take over the national team, has turned down the post and also
declined any other position within the federation.</TE>
<TE>   "He decided not to accept the national team job, nor will he
continue working with the AFA," Grondona said, without further
explanation. Bielsa and Peckerman have been in a drawn-out battle
with the cash-strapped federation over unpaid salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The highly regarded Peckerman was the main assistant to Bielsa at
the World Cup after previously leading Argentina's under-20 national
teams to victory at the FIFA World Youth Championships of 1997 and
2001.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Women to Play Scotland</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's national team will play Scotland on Sept. 8 in
Columbus, Ohio, as preparation for the Oct. 27-Nov. 9 CONCACAF
Women's Gold Cup, scheduled, in part, for the Rose Bowl and Cal State
Fullerton's Titan Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Scotland is led by striker Julie Fleeting, who plays for the San
Diego Spirit in the Women's United Soccer Assn. The 21-year-old has
scored 78 goals in 58 games for her national team. The U.S. and
Scotland have never played each other.</TE>
<TE>   Denmark 1, USA 0</TE>
<TE>   The United States' chances of winning the Nordic Cup for the
fourth year in a row suffered a setback Wednesday when the U.S.
women's under-21 national team was beaten, 1-0, by Denmark in Karina,
Finland, on a 79th-minute goal by Pernille Schmidt.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. now must defeat Greece on Friday and hope that Finland
can beat Denmark that same day in order for the American team to
advance to Sunday's championship game against either Germany or
Norway.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has won the Nordic Cup four out of the last five years
and Wednesday's loss was its first in the tournament since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Kadafi Breaks Ankle</TE>
<TE>   Saadi Kadafi, the son of Libya's president and not coincidentally
a member of the country's national team, broke his ankle in a
collision with a goalkeeper while playing for Libya against Cuneo, an
Italian amateur side, in Mondovi, Italy, Monday night, the Italian
news agency ANSA reported.</TE>
<TE>   Jancker, Edilson Move On</TE>
<TE>   Two players who were on the field at the World Cup final in Japan
found themselves moving to new clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Germany striker Carsten Jancker, 27, has been acquired from Bayern
Munich by Udinese of Italy's Serie A for an undisclosed fee. Jancker
has scored eight goals in 29 games for Germany, and 49 in 148 games
with Bayern Munich, Cologne and Austria's Rapid Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   German media said he had signed a four-year contract worth $3
million.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil forward Edilson, 31, has returned to Japan on a six-month
loan to Kashiwa Reysol of the J-League from his Brazilian club
Cruzeiro.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon Keeps Schaefer</TE>
<TE>   Winfried Schaefer, the German coach who led Cameroon to the
African Nations Cup title in Mali in February but could not get it
past the first round at the World Cup, will remain the country's
national team coach, he said in Berlin.</TE>

<HD>Sloppy Win For Sparks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the compact, 32-game WNBA schedule has its dog days of summer.</LD>
<LD>   That's where the Sparks find themselves. They're past the All-Star
break but not quite near the end of the season, when they sharpen up
for the playoffs. Games like Wednesday's 73-69 victory over the
Portland Fire, before 18,542, the largest crowd to see the Sparks at
Staples Center, are just that--games.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, they got a workmanlike effort from Lisa Leslie, who had 21
points and 11 rebounds for her 12th double-double this year. Nikki
Teasley had 14 points, equaling her career high. And Latasha Byears,
who had been out five games because of a suspension and a knee
injury, returned to gobble up nine rebounds in 18 minutes off the
bench.</LD>
<TE>   Still, as talented as the 19-4 Sparks are, even they will look
ragged when not motivated. On Wednesday a team-record 27 turnovers
neutralized a respectable 45.6% shooting from the field (26 of 57).
The Sparks wound up having to hold off a pesky Portland (14-10) team
that might have stolen the game at the end if it had shot better (24
of 72, 33.3%) and rebounded better (46-26 in favor of the Sparks).</TE>
<TE>   Reserve guard Tamicha Jackson led the Fire with 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Spark Coach Michael Cooper, who in the past would have had steam
billowing out of his ears after a lackluster display by his team, was
reflective afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like we were fighting ourselves today," Cooper said.
"It was a tough game to get through. But I also think this is a
residual from that long road trip; I still don't think we got it out
of our system."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Cooper doesn't have to psychologically beat up his
team after a game like Wednesday's. The Sparks have learned to do
that themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Today was really ugly," said Spark guard Sophia Witherspoon, who
had three points Wednesday after getting 15 Monday against Orlando.
"None of us are happy with our play today. Twenty-seven turnovers
cannot happen."</TE>
<TE>   Tamecka Dixon, who took six shots and scored eight points, added:
"We need to work on our focus. We're a little complacent ... even
though we know we have to work on some things. When it's not a
Houston or a New York coming, it can be tough to get up for teams."</TE>
<TE>   What the Sparks don't want is for this game to be indicative of
the kind of team they are this year, because they haven't become the
team they thought they could be.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've really been crisp all season," said DeLisha
Milton, who had only six points but took down a game-high 13
rebounds. "Some of it is how teams are playing us. The game is not
going to come as easy as it did last year, when it was wide open. We
were very good at that, and teams are taking that away from us. We're
not as fluid in the half-court set as when we're running.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you learn lessons the hard way. This [pattern] is
something we've been trying to break for a while, but it has yet to
sink into our heads that, OK, if a play's not there don't force it."</TE>
<TE>   After bolting to a 23-14 lead, the Sparks got sloppy and tried to
throw long passes after every rebound for cheap layups. They wound up
instead with 11 first-half turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire cut the Sparks' lead to 35-33 on a 15-foot jumper by
Sylvia Crawley with 1:14 left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get out and run, and we had success with that last
year," Cooper said. "[But] in trying to repeat as a champion you
can't do the things you did last year. Last year we could throw the
ball out to half court and get the break going. This year we have to
be a little more disciplined."</TE>

<HD>Roddick Is Tough Enough</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Fourth-seeded player uses powerful serve to defeat
Vahaly, 7-5, 6-4, at the Mercedes-Benz Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, Andy Roddick made his way into the quarterfinals of the
Mercedes-Benz Cup tennis tournament Wednesday night at UCLA tennis
center. Not as expected, he got a tough match.</LD>
<LD>   Roddick beat Brian Vahaly, 7-5, 6-4, and if you are a tennis fan
and haven't heard the name Vahaly before, you are in the majority.</LD>
<LD>   Vahaly just turned 23, is the winningest player in the history of
the University of Virginia and that and a dime will get you a cup of
coffee. Since then, he has been one of those struggling nameless,
faceless players slugging away in minor league tournaments in such
places as Aptos, Calif., and Quoque, N.Y., in the hopes of getting
into the big time.</LD>
<TE>   Well, Vahaly made it Wednesday night. Featured match, night
session, crowded stands of 6,764 against a marquee star just miles
from Hollywood. He got there by winning three Challenger tournaments,
compiling a 25-5 record out in the tennis boondocks, scratching
enough points out there to take his ranking from No. 403 at the end
of last year to No. 118, and beating veteran Italian player David
Sanguinetti in the first round here. It was Valhalla for Vahaly.</TE>
<TE>   And then along came Roddick, bigger, taller, stronger and three
years his junior, firing serves and forehands the likes of which
Vahaly had never seen before. "His serve was the best thing I've ever
seen in my life," the bright, quotable Vahaly said. "It was so fast,
not only did I not see it, but I had no chance to hit it. I have
played a lot at the Challenger level. This was a level way above
that."</TE>
<TE>   Still, somehow, with a tough baseline game and a calm demeanor
that did not give away the fact that he was totally in awe of where
he was and what he was doing, Vahaly got to two set points against
Roddick's serve at 4-5 of the first. He did not get either, and he
was refreshingly open about saying why.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe that was happening to me, that I had two set
points against Andy Roddick," he said. "So, pretty much, I just
froze. I had my best shot, a backhand passing shot, and I couldn't
believe I was looking at that with a chance to break. So I froze."</TE>
<TE>   If honesty won tennis matches, Vahaly would be No. 1 in the world.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that, when Roddick tossed in a 135-mph second serve
ace, it was something he had never seen before. "I've never even seen
a serve over 128 before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And after revealing that he had a chance to practice with Pete
Sampras in Palm Desert earlier in the year, he was asked to compare
Roddick's serve to that of Sampras. "The only way I can compare is to
tell you I can't return either one of them," he said, smiling again.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-2 Roddick, whose feet are about as long as Valhaly's
arms, gave his rookie opponent credit afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who can win as much as he has, at any level of tennis, is
a good player," Roddick said. "The only difference between us was my
serve. I don't think this guy is going to lose to a lot of players
who don't have that extra weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick is seeded fourth here. No. 3 Sebastian Grosjean of France
was an upset victim, losing to fellow Frenchman Michael Llodra, 6-3,
3-6, 7-6 (3), and No. 8 Max Mirnyi of Belurus took out Paradorn
Srichaphan of Thailand, the conqueror of Andre Agassi at Wimbledon,
7-6 (3), 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   In the second night match, Wimbledon semifinalist Xavier Malisse
of Belgium defeated Orange County product Taylor Dent, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An eventful year for Alex Bogomolov Jr. has became even more
significant this week.</TE>
<TE>   Bogomolov, a 19-year-old Russian-born American whose claim to fame
had been beating Roddick in the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s Super National
Hardcourt Championships' boys' 16 title match three years ago, took a
significant step up in competition when he turned professional at
last year's U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   But he is quickly proving he was ready for the jump.</TE>
<TE>   A qualifier who came into the Mercedes-Benz Cup ranked No. 278 in
the world, he will face Nicolas Kiefer of Germany in a second-round
match at noon today after a 6-4, 6-4 upset Tuesday night of another
German star, top-seeded Tommy Haas, the No. 3 player in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't fall asleep at all last night," Bogomolov said. "I
called my sister in Miami. I woke her up at four in the morning, and
she was pretty mad about that.</TE>
<TE>   "But then when I told her the reason, she was really happy for me,
and she couldn't sleep either."</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Increases Lead</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Despite a commanding 5:06 margin after 16 stages,
he refuses to relax by recalling his worst effort in the Tour de
France two years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LA PLAGNE, France</DL>
<LD>Even as Lance Armstrong closes in on his fourth consecutive victory
in the Tour de France, he couldn't help remembering his worst
performance.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong extended his overall lead to more than five minutes
Wednesday, finishing third behind Dutch rider Michael Boogerd in the
grueling 16th stage--the most difficult of the three-week Tour.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old Texan finished well ahead of his nearest rival,
Spain's Joseba Beloki, and stretched his lead from 4 minutes 21
seconds to 5:06--a huge margin now that the Tour's toughest stages
are over.</LD>
<TE>   And yet, he could not relax heading into today's 88-mile run from
Aime to Cluses in the Alps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same stage as two years ago when I cracked at
Joux-Plane," Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong was recalling the difficulties he had in the 2000 Tour
on the stage from Courchevel to Morzine--which he called at the time
"the hardest day of my life on a bike."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong suddenly tired while pushing up the Col de Joux-Plane
pass in the final mountain stage two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Postal Service team rider finished the leg far behind his
archrival, Jan Ullrich of Germany, and lost nearly two minutes off
his overall lead.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong blamed lack of food and sugar for his loss of form.</TE>
<TE>   That was his last weak spell in any Tour de France. In 2001, he
was flawless throughout, and this year he has consistently increased
his lead over Beloki.</TE>
<TE>   Barring illness or injury, Armstrong is almost certain to win a
fourth consecutive title when the Tour ends on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong's lead in this Tour is less than the 6:15 advantage he
held over Fernando Escartin after 16 stages in 1999. It is also less
than the 5:37 lead he had over Ullrich in 2000, after a disastrous
day at Joux-Plane.</TE>
<TE>   His lead is one second more than the advantage he had over Ullrich
in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Today's stage features four tough climbs, but none that compare to
the three climbs in Wednesday's leg from Les Deux-Alpes to La Plagne.</TE>
<TE>   Also, he won't have to face Joux-Plane.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong is also expected to extend his lead in Saturday's
individual time trial.</TE>
<TE>   He finished last year's race with a 6:44 advantage over Ullrich,
aided, in part, by his stunning time-trial run.</TE>
<TE>   Boogerd, of the Rabobank team, won Wednesday's 111.29-mile stage
in 5:48.29.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's Carlos Sastre was second, just ahead of Armstrong. Both
finished 1:25 behind Boogerd, and 37 seconds ahead of Beloki.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong earned eight bonus seconds for finishing third.</TE>
<TE>   Boogerd said he hadn't thought about being overtaken by Armstrong
in the final stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I was only suffering and fighting to make the stage," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boogerd, who also won a stage in the 1996 Tour, called Wednesday's
victory "probably the most beautiful win of my career."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong was congratulated by Prince Albert of Monaco after the
stage.</TE>

<HD>Strong Advances Seen in Africa Peace Efforts</HD>
<DH>Conflicts: The potential for investments and debt relief
appears to add to momentum toward deals in a continent long scarred
by war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Breakthroughs this week in peace talks for Sudan and Congo, coupled
with continued progress on a cease-fire in Angola, present the best
chance in decades to ease the suffering of tens of millions of
Africans affected by war, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Sudan's government and the country's main rebel group declared
this weekend that they had agreed on a framework that could end a
19-year civil war in which more than 2 million have died.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, neighboring Congo announced that it is close to ending
a conflict that has embroiled the armies of six nations and killed
more than 2.5 million Congolese, mainly from disease and starvation.</LD>
<TE>   And the top U.S. State Department official for African affairs was
in southern Africa on Wednesday urging rebels and Angola's government
to cement an end to a nearly 30-year civil war that has killed an
estimated 1.5 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Some Africa-watchers say a new debate about how the continent's 53
countries should pursue economic and political progress may be giving
a boost to the various peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   The New Partnership for Africa's Development, an economic plan
approved by the African Union this month, calls on nations to end
their wars, promote democracy and welcome private investors--in
exchange for billions of dollars in investments from the world's
richest nations.</TE>
<TE>   The African Union, itself launched this month, has also made it
clear that it plans to intervene in the internal affairs of member
states to stop human rights abuses, war crimes and genocide. The
union's predecessor, the Organization of African Unity, was prevented
by its own rules from doing so, even when atrocities occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling among warring parties across Africa that they
are being left out of a new momentum taking place in some parts of
Africa that may see new levels of investment and debt relief," said
Salih Booker, head of Africa Action, a nonprofit Washington group.</TE>
<TE>   World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn reinforced that sentiment
when he met in Tanzania this month with the finance ministers of nine
war-ravaged countries to discuss how the bank could help reconstruct
their economies.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue of peace is something that is in Africa's hands," he
said. "What you need to do is to sort out for yourselves the question
that killing each other is a lot less preferable to living with each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Booker and other Africa specialists say U.S. involvement is
crucial to secure final peace deals.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sudan talks, taking place here in Kenya's capital, the U.S.
must combine a credible set of incentives with pressure on the
government and rebels, said John Prendergast, coordinator of Africa
programs for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think
tank.</TE>
<TE>   "Is Africa going to be the last item on the White House's agenda,
or is George Bush himself going to pick up the phone a couple times a
week ... make some calls to the leaders, and tell them how important
it is that they reach some peace agreement?" asked Prendergast, a top
policymaker on Sudan during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The highest level of commitment could help determine whether we
have a final and lasting peace deal in the Sudan."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials insist that they are actively
engaged in Africa. Three Cabinet members--Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell, Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick and Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill--have made official visits to Africa, and
the White House has announced that Bush will visit next year to
highlight free trade, anti-corruption efforts and human rights
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is hoping that its involvement in the Sudan
peace process could be used as a model for solving other major
conflicts in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Sudan is one of the longest-lasting and most brutal conflicts on
the face of the Earth," said Walter Kansteiner, assistant secretary
of State for African affairs. "If you could put together a Sudan
peace process and have a Congo peace process and further the peace
emerging in Angola, that would be an incredible swath of Africa that
will be turned from war to a peaceful solution. It could bring great
improvement to the lives of people in Africa."</TE>
<TE>   At the Sudan talks, U.S. officials helped both sides agree on the
two most contentious issues: separation of church and state and
self-determination for rebel-controlled areas in the south.</TE>
<TE>   The war, which erupted in 1983, has pitted Sudan's Islamic
government in the north against the largely Christian and animist
south.</TE>
<TE>   Under the interim deal announced over the weekend, both sides
agreed that Islamic law would apply only in the north. The deal calls
for a transitional period of six years followed by an internationally
supervised referendum in which southerners will vote on whether to
secede.</TE>
<TE>   When talks resume next month, the parties are expected to discuss
other key issues such as power-sharing and how to allocate revenue
from oil fields in the south.</TE>
<TE>   Prendergast, the Sudan specialist, said the U.S. war on terrorism
probably helped to hasten the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, Sudan--which once hosted Osama bin Laden and which
is among a handful of countries listed by the U.S. as sponsors of
terrorism--has cooperated with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, turning
over files on Bin Laden's network.</TE>
<TE>   "Khartoum is still not sure what the Pentagon is willing to do
[against Sudan] in its anti-terrorism effort," Prendergast said. "One
of its goals at these [peace] talks is to avoid becoming a target."</TE>
<TE>   Prendergast and others say both the government and the rebels
could benefit from a comprehensive peace deal.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan would be able to expand its oil industry and borrow money to
revive its economy. The rebels would see aid flow to the south for
development projects.</TE>
<TE>   Similar benefits could flow to Rwanda and Congo, the two main
combatants in the Central African conflict, if they can put into
effect a peace pact outlined this week.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting exploded four years ago when Rwanda and Uganda backed
rebels seeking to oust then-Congolese President Laurent Kabila.</TE>
<TE>   The two nations, which had helped to install Kabila, accused him
of supporting guerrillas threatening regional security.</TE>
<TE>   Rwanda eventually sent in troops to support rebels in eastern
Congo, while Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia dispatched soldiers to prop
up the government.</TE>
<TE>   Under the peace pact brokered by South African Deputy President
Jacob Zuma, Congo has agreed to disarm and return to Rwanda thousands
of Hutu militiamen who helped slaughter about 800,000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus in Rwanda's 1994 genocide. In return, Rwanda will
withdraw about 30,000 soldiers from Congo. The deal has to be signed
by the two nations' presidents.</TE>
<TE>   As for Angola, Kansteiner was in Luanda, the capital, Wednesday to
urge President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leaders to reach a
final peace deal. In April, both sides agreed to stop fighting and
negotiate a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Africa watchers say peace in Angola could benefit the U.S. by
enhancing the prospects of American oil companies that operate in the
southwest African country.</TE>
<TE>   Booker, of Africa Action, said African leaders need to lobby the
West to do more to help current peace efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "These leaders ought to be doing more to get more Western help for
their peacemaking efforts," he said. "But many of them have become
numbed or used to these outrageous conflicts claiming so many
innocent lives."</TE>

<HD>Blair Vows to Curb N. Ireland Violence</HD>
<DH>Britain: Premier declines to impose sanctions on
paramilitaries but plans preventive measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britain declined to impose sanctions on any of the paramilitary
armies in Northern Ireland or their affiliated political parties
Wednesday, but it warned that it would establish "more rigorous"
measures to prevent violence.</LD>
<LD>   "It is no longer sufficient just that there should be no terrorist
violence," Prime Minister Tony Blair told the lower house of
Parliament, the Commons. "We have to be clear that the preparation of
violence has also ceased."</LD>
<LD>   Paramilitary members are under stepped-up surveillance, 250 more
police officers are on duty in Northern Ireland's capital, Belfast,
and the law is being studied to see whether new arrest powers can be
given to security forces in response to violence, said John Reid,
Britain's Northern Ireland secretary.</LD>
<TE>   He also said all parties in the 108-member Northern Ireland
Assembly have been asked to reaffirm their "total commitment" to
peace.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-British unionists and pro-independence republicans in the
British province have accused paramilitary groups on the opposite
side of fomenting violent demonstrations in Belfast this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Each side has called on Blair to invoke sanctions against the
other.</TE>
<TE>   When Blair's government declined to do so Wednesday, unionists and
republicans both expressed disappointment. But neither side pulled
out of the province's power-sharing Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   That means the peace process begun by the 1998 Good Friday
agreement can continue. Under that pact, the armed paramilitary
groups affiliated with parties that signed it are required to
maintain a cease-fire. If any sectarian group violates the truce, the
prescribed sanction is a sort of political death penalty: The group's
affiliated political party is to lose its seats in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Although police in Northern Ireland have reported acts of violence
by republican and unionist paramilitary members, Blair has never
invoked that sanction. To ban any party from the Assembly could well
lead to a collapse of the local government, and the peace process
with it.</TE>
<TE>   The warning of tougher measures didn't seem to deter extremist
violence. A bombing Wednesday claimed by Irish Republican Army
dissidents damaged the home of pro-unionist House of Lords member
Lord Brookeborough, grandson of a former Protestant prime minister of
Northern Ireland, and suspected IRA dissidents tried but failed to
hijack the main Dublin-to-Belfast train.</TE>

<LD>   Monsoon rains have killed at least 175 people in Nepal, Bangladesh
and India, with swollen rivers flooding thousands of villages and
triggering mudslides, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The rising waters have forced millions to flee to higher ground.
The worst displacement was in Bangladesh, where more than 2 million
people fled, said relief officials in the capital, Dhaka. Many lost
houses, crops and livestock.</TE>
<TE>   The death toll of 69 in that nation includes 38 people who died
from diarrhea caused by drinking polluted water.</TE>

<HD>Israel Opens Probes on Gaza Strike Amid Trading of Blame</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Outrage over attack on residential area marks a
rare intense airing of doubts and dissent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Amid intense debate and finger-pointing, Israeli military and
intelligence agencies launched investigations Wednesday into what
went wrong in an airstrike that pulverized part of a Gaza City
neighborhood and killed 15 residents, most of them children.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon faced tough questions in the press, on
radio talk shows and in parliament over why he approved a mission
that seemed certain to cause many civilian deaths.</LD>
<LD>   The army acknowledged serious miscalculations in an action that
Palestinians branded a war crime.</LD>
<TE>   In the Tuesday operation, which succeeded in its aim of killing
the top military commander of the militant group Hamas, an Israeli
warplane dropped a one-ton bomb on the man's two-story safe house on
a residential street. It was the middle of the night, when most
residents were asleep.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary review of aerial photos that military planners used
showed a collection of shacks and other homes adjacent or very close
to the safe house, Israeli state television reported.</TE>
<TE>   The army and Israel's domestic security service, often at
loggerheads over how to fight the nation's battles, traded
accusations over who was to blame for what government officials claim
was the faulty intelligence that led them to believe they could
attack Hamas chieftain Salah Shehada without killing many civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Shehada was killed, along with his wife, 14-year-old daughter and
an aide. So too were eight children in neighboring homes, plus two of
their mothers and another man.</TE>
<TE>   A central question was why such heavy ordnance was used to target
a single man in one of the world's most congested areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is Israel has been playing with fire for quite some
time," Amos Harel, military affairs correspondent of the liberal
Haaretz newspaper, wrote in a front-page analysis. "In light of the
horrifying terror attacks on Israeli citizens and the urgent need to
prevent further attacks, a kind of apathetic indifference to the
possibility of Palestinian casualties has set in."</TE>
<TE>   After the strike, Sharon quickly labeled the operation one of
Israel's greatest successes in what it terms its war on terrorism.
But after widespread international condemnation, he said that if he
had known there would be so many civilian casualties, he would not
have given his go-ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened was a tragedy, not an intention," Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Other officials were more skeptical. "Ultimately it was the
military's mistake, but it does not send an F-16 to a populated area
without political authorization," said Haim Ramon, chairman of
parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the two men who
approved the strike, said they had been told by intelligence agencies
that the risk of civilian casualties was minimal. But intelligence
officials were quoted widely in Wednesday's newspapers as saying they
had warned the politicians that civilian casualties were a
possibility. And one unidentified official told the top-selling
Yediot Aharonot newspaper that he specifically said Shehada's wife
and daughter would probably be with him.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, the army's planning commander, Maj. Gen. Giora
Eiland, defended the decision to attack and said the military did not
believe that Shehada's family would be present.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a mistake," he said, noting that Israel's F-16s had
aborted earlier missions to kill Shehada when they detected
civilians. "We take decisions like this dozens of times every day.
It's extremely hard. Sometimes mistakes are made."</TE>
<TE>   The criticism Wednesday focused not only on what even the
Israel-friendly White House called the attack's "heavy-handed" nature
but also on the poor timing. Palestinian officials said they had been
poised to enter into a cease-fire agreement that would have suspended
military operations by all major factions; now, all of those factions
are united in their vow to avenge the deaths in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Palestinians were overstating the potential success of
their inchoate cease-fire agreement, the Gaza bombing certainly came
at a time when figures on both sides were making progress in defusing
tensions. Even Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin said--a few
hours before the airstrike--that he was considering suspending the
group's suicide bombing campaign in exchange for a number of Israeli
concessions.</TE>
<TE>   There was wide consensus among Israelis that the operation was
badly bungled. Even among those who justify the extrajudicial slaying
of someone like Shehada--and there is ample support here for such
measures--the loss of civilian life was too much to stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say that human ideals are not important," Nahum Barnea, the
dean of Israel's political commentators, wrote Wednesday. "Did the
usefulness of this operation, security-wise, outweigh its damage?"</TE>
<TE>   Damage was done not only to the lives of Palestinians, he noted,
but also to Israel's credibility. And then there was the likelihood
of a new wave of retaliatory attacks by Hamas and other militant
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Americans who can kill civilians in Afghanistan and "not
care," Barnea said, "we, the Israelis, pay a heavy price for our
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Early today, one Israeli was killed and another injured when men
opened fire on their car near the Jewish settlement of Elei Zahav,
south of the West Bank town of Kalkilya, rescue services and the
Israeli military said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Peres said Israel would pull back troops from some
occupied areas of the West Bank if they remain calm. He also said
Israel had released $45 million in blocked Palestinian taxes and
issued 4,000 permits to Palestinians who work in Israel. Each measure
already was under negotiation during talks between Peres and the
Palestinians before the airstrike.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis have been largely supportive of the campaign against the
Palestinian Authority of Yasser Arafat, and there has been little
outcry over internationally controversial measures such as
assassinations of militant leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But the uproar over the Gaza operation marks a rare and intense
airing of doubts and dissent.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were done in such a way that terrible and damaging results
were inevitable," the daily Maariv said in its main editorial. Its
banner headline said: "The Assassination. And the Embarrassment."</TE>
<TE>   "We must not be dragged into wild actions that do not distinguish
between guilty and innocent."</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear whether the furor would prompt changes, either in
the policies of the Sharon government or in the dynamics of a peace
process that has been moribund for many months.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has enjoyed strong support from the Bush administration in
fighting the Palestinians, with hardly a peep of international
criticism as his forces have reoccupied the West Bank and put
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians under house arrest in an
attempt to stop suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The outrage over the Gaza bombing may inject more caution into
Israel's strategic planning as it pursues Palestinian militants,
analysts here said. Army officials acknowledged that a wave of
retaliatory strikes by Palestinian militants is likely in the short
term but said they hoped that in the long run the removal of Shehada
will impair the ability of Hamas to dispatch suicide bombers and
carry out major attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The army's Eiland said Shehada had been planning a series of
spectacular operations, including a scheme to sneak a boat loaded
with explosives onto an Israeli beach and one to demolish a new
bridge used by Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip.</TE>

<HD>Fox's Party Won Vote, Court Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico's highest electoral court ruled Wednesday that President
Vicente Fox's party won a spring mayoral election in the border city
of Ciudad Juarez.</LD>
<LD>   Reversing an earlier decision in a two-month battle that dragged
relations between Fox and the opposition to a new low, the Federal
Electoral Tribunal unanimously ratified the victory for Fox's
National Action Party, or PAN.</LD>
<LD>   It said that the party's Jesus Alfredo Delgado won the May 12 race
and that it found no proof of vote manipulation or irregularities.
The court's decision is not subject to appeal. The ruling was
expected to spark more political bickering in the city, home to about
300 maquiladora plants that produce and assemble goods for foreign
companies. Juarez is across the border from El Paso.</LD>
<TE>   The opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which
ruled Mexico for 71 years until Fox's election in 2000, had charged
the PAN with manipulating the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month the state electoral court, which is controlled
by the PRI, agreed and threw out the election results, spawning a
violent protest in front of City Hall and a blockade at one of Ciudad
Juarez's four cross-border bridges.</TE>
<TE>   Delgado, who was not available for comment, is to be sworn in
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Pakistan Bomb Plot</HD>
<DH>Crime: Member of Al Qaeda-linked group is accused in fatal
attack at a U.S. Consulate.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A member of an extremist group linked to Al Qaeda was arrested
Wednesday on suspicion of financing and planning a June car bombing
at the U.S. Consulate here that killed 12 Pakistanis, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Police and Interior Ministry officials, speaking anonymously,
identified the suspect as Mohammed Ashraf, treasurer of the
Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen al-Almi, whose two leaders were arrested this
month and who police say confessed to roles in the June 14 attack.</LD>
<LD>   The group and its leaders also are suspected in a suicide bombing
May 8 at the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi. Eleven French engineers and
three others, including the bomber, were killed in that attack.</LD>
<TE>   Ashraf was among the group that planned the consulate attack,
police said. "Ashraf also provided money for the purchase of
explosive material to carry out the attack on [the] U.S. Consulate in
Karachi," an Interior Ministry official said in Islamabad, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Ashraf also confessed his role in scores of terrorist acts,
including a February rocket attack on the Karachi airport, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   The state-run news agency Associated Press of Pakistan reported
that Ashraf disclosed names of other group members involved in
planning the attack. They included Mohammed Imran, chief of
Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen al-Almi, and Mohammed Hanif, both of whom were
arrested this month.</TE>
<TE>   Imran and Hanif also allegedly conspired to kill President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf during his April visit to Karachi.</TE>

<DH>Religion: John Paul II gets some rest on island before
appearing at the event in Toronto today.</DH>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic youths from around the globe sang hymns and exchanged
greetings in dozens of languages as they met in Canada for religious
unity and to encounter like-minded people from other cultures.</LD>
<LD>   Most of all, though, they came to see and hear Pope John Paul II.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe this could be the last World Youth Day with this
pope," said Ariane Vieiraleite, 23, one of 3,000 pilgrims from
Brazil. "He will be a messenger, a prophet for God."</LD>
<TE>   The pope rode a golf cart Wednesday morning along some of the
tree-shaded trails of the remote island where he was resting for a
few days, according to the Canadian Embassy to the Holy See. His
first public event will be a welcoming ceremony today.</TE>
<TE>   Catholics from myriad cultures and countries have journeyed by
plane, bus and train to be close to their spiritual leader.</TE>
<TE>   The pilgrims, most 16 to 35, have come for activities that include
catechism classes with bishops, a reenactment of the Stations of the
Cross along a downtown avenue, and an all-night vigil followed by the
final Mass on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Leon Mamgark, 24, a Catholic from the northern Canadian territory
of Nunavut, wore a traditional jacket and boots to meet the
82-year-old pope in person during an airport ceremony Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an enormous experience," said the librarian and volunteer
firefighter. "I was inspired by him. At his age, I don't know if I
would be able to go on like that."</TE>

<HD>Long Trek Home to a New Land</HD>
<DH>Some of Africa's oldest refugees--those who fled Eritrea
for Sudan four decades ago--are returning with children who have
never seen their parents' native soil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABOARD THE AL AMIN EXPRESS, Sudan-Eritrea border--After living their
entire lives in a refugee camp in the baking desert plains of eastern
Sudan, the Abdel-Rahman children are going to a homeland they've
never known.</LD>
<LD>   A rickety red bus, emblazoned with the name Al Amin Express, is
taking the family to a new life across the border in Eritrea, a small
country on the Red Sea.</LD>
<LD>   Like other Eritrean refugees who are making the journey with them,
the Abdel-Rahmans have no idea what awaits them, except uncertainty.</LD>
<TE>   But 13-year-old Neima, despite battling a bout of malaria and
leaving all her friends behind, says she can't wait to see her
parents' native land. Her brother Elkhair, 23, says he wants to help
the family erect a new mud hut before pursuing his goal of becoming a
doctor. His 7-year-old sister, Marwa, wearing her special pink lace
dress, bounces on her father's knee. This is the most exciting
excursion of her life, she says.</TE>
<TE>   In the second row of seats in the clattering bus, Abdel-Rahman
Mohammed and his wife, Fatma, seem pensive. They are worried about
Hanan, the 21-year-old daughter they left behind in Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   But the 65-year-old Abdel-Rahman has made his decision to return
to his country, and he's sticking to it. The couple and eight of
their children are making the trip with 611 other Eritreans in a
convoy of 60 buses and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Abdel-Rahmans' fellow travelers are Africa's oldest
refugees. They've been living in Sudan since the early 1960s, when
Ethiopia's then-emperor, Haile Selassie, annexed Eritrea, a former
Italian colony, sparking a 30-year conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Now the refugees are desperately trying to beat a deadline. Two
months ago, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
declared that it was ending refugee status for Eritreans in Sudan and
elsewhere Dec. 31. The agency said the Eritreans no longer needed
protection because their country had ended its struggle with Ethiopia
in 1991 and attained independence two years later. A later border war
ended with a peace treaty in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   So the Abdel-Rahmans have boarded the Al Amin Express, a
50-year-old British-made Bedford bus with no air conditioning. Part
of the welding that holds the dashboard to the front of the vehicle
has come loose, making the bus clatter and dance even at the slowest
speed.</TE>
<TE>   Someone appears to have tossed a rock at the windshield in the
spot exactly in the driver's line of vision. The driver, a south
Sudanese from the Dinka tribe wearing a lily-white robe known as a
galabia, sometimes has to dip his head from side to side to look
around the cracks for oncoming traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Fleeing to Sudan</TE>
<TE>   Sudan has been home for Abdel-Rahman Mohammed since 1974, the year
he and Fatma fled with their two babies from their small town near
the Eritrean capital, Asmara. Abdel-Rahman had heard that Emperor
Selassie's troops were slaughtering Eritreans, particularly Muslims
like him, so one night he and his family made the 15-hour journey to
Sudan, where he joined hundreds of thousands of other Eritrean
refugees crammed into U.N. refugee camps there.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations had opened a single camp in 1967, but it soon
established about 20 more that stretch over an area of eastern Sudan
larger than Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The camps are a sea of tukuls--tiny round mud huts covered with
grass roofs--arranged in cookie-cutter uniformity. Tukuls are the
only respite from the searing Sudanese sun that on many days sends
temperatures soaring to a paralyzing 125 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the refugees cut down virtually all the trees
around the camps to support their tukuls and use as firewood.
Stripped bare of vegetation, the camps are badlands, exposed to the
winds called mahboob that periodically rip through, stirring up dust
devils and blasting the huts with ashen sand.</TE>
<TE>   The small clump of bottle-brush trees that Abdel-Rahman planted in
his frontyard stand like lonesome sentinels.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the desolate setting of the Shagarab camp where he lived
for 28 years, Abdel-Rahman considered it his home. It was the place
where he welcomed nine children into the world, where he celebrated
four of their weddings and where he was introduced to his first
grandchild. It was where he provided for his family by working as a
sanitation worker in his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   And by most accounts, the Sudanese were gracious hosts. They
permitted the refugees to cultivate nearby land and, unlike other
countries that restrict refugees' movement, allowed them to live in
urban areas and attend Sudanese universities.</TE>
<TE>   Refugee camps like those that dot eastern Sudan have become
permanent fixtures on Africa's landscape. U.N. officials estimate
that 13 million Africans are refugees or have been displaced within
their own countries by long-running conflicts such as the ones in
Eritrea, Angola, Congo and Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   While Sudan was welcoming Eritrean refugees in the north, it was
creating millions of other refugees by pursuing a brutal civil war
against rebels seeking autonomy in the south. Four million Sudanese
have been displaced by the 19-year conflict, and 2 million others
have died, mainly from famine. Many Sudanese refugees are living in
decrepit camps in Kenya, Tanzania and neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   Other African nations also swap refugees. The flow of refugees has
been so prevalent in Central Africa, for example, that only two
countries--Zambia and Tanzania--of the nine bordering war-torn Congo
produced no refugees in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Abdel-Rahmans and refugees across Africa have seen their
subsistence standard of living worsen in the last few years as
wealthy nations cut their funding to the U.N. refugee agency and
other humanitarian groups.</TE>
<TE>   During the last year, the Abdel-Rahmans' rations of wheat flour,
beans, salt, vegetable oil and powdered milk were slashed by almost
half after budget cuts at the U.N. food agency.</TE>
<TE>   Many Eritrean refugees claim that the United Nations has been
deliberately cutting rations to force them to return home.</TE>
<TE>   Abdel-Rahman's decision to return had little to do with alleged
pressure or appeals from U.N. refugee agency officials, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, he ignored leaflets assuring him and his neighbors that
returnees would not be harassed by Eritrean government authorities.
Returning families, the leaflets promised, would be given blankets,
food and farming tools to help with resettlement. The refugees would
be allowed to build small huts on land allocated by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Abdel-Rahman was chatting with his longtime friend
Idris, who had been living in the camp since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "Idris," Abdel-Rahman recalled saying, "wouldn't it be a shame if
we died in this camp without our children getting to know their
aunts, uncles and cousins in Eritrea? Wouldn't it be a shame if they
didn't get to see their own country? A people need to be in their
country."</TE>
<TE>   Idris agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Idris suffered a heart attack and died.</TE>
<TE>   That was the day Abdel-Rahman decided to register with U.N.
officials to return to Eritrea.</TE>
<TE>   On Their Way Home</TE>
<TE>   The day before the Al Amin Express rolls out, neighbors gather in
the Abdel-Rahmans' yard to help them dismantle their tukul. Cutting
trees is forbidden in Eritrea, so the family plans to use the grass
roof and pieces of twigs to fashion a new home.</TE>
<TE>   The beds, clothes and the rest of the family's belongings are
loaded onto a truck hired by the refugee agency.</TE>
<TE>   Abdel-Rahman, who hopes to become a roadside shopkeeper in
Eritrea, loads up a newly bought blue metal cupboard that will help
him fulfill his dream.</TE>
<TE>   His daughters round up the nine hens, which have provided the
family with fresh eggs, to put on a separate truck that will
transport refugees' sheep, cattle and donkeys to Eritrea.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an uprooting in transition," says Bellings Sikanda, a
U.N. official observing the move. "These people have grown roots
here. Now they have to pull them up and start new lives."</TE>
<TE>   The Shagarab camp is all that Neima has known. All her friends
live in it. They aren't making the trip with the Abdel-Rahmans
because their parents say they still need to repay shopkeepers who
gave them credit to buy food, clothes and other goods.</TE>
<TE>   Neima has been outside Shagarab only a few times, but she says she
wants to grow up to speak English and live in a city.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be like you," she says boldly to Aisha Hummeida, a U.N.
refugee agency employee who recently graduated from Oxford
University.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the family's departure, the neighbors throw a small
party for Neima and three of her sisters. The girls' hands are
adorned with henna, and Neima is presented with a pair of dangling
gold earrings, which cost $25--more than many refugees earn in a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Neima's anticipation is mixed with apprehension. "This is my
home," she says, flashing a coy teenage smile. "All my friends live
here. I know nothing about Eritrea. I feel like I'm Sudanese."</TE>
<TE>   Abdel-Rahman is in no mood for regret. "I want my children in
front of my eyes," he says. "I love Sudan, but I have to go home."</TE>
<TE>   The family will leave behind 21-year-old Hanan. A few years ago,
her husband was among several thousand Eritrean refugees in Sudan who
were resettled in New Zealand. She's waiting in the Shagarab camp
until he can afford to send her a plane ticket. An older brother will
remain with her, then after she leaves he'll join the family in
Eritrea. Abdel-Rahman's oldest daughter, 29-year-old Sofia, is
already living in Eritrea.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the Abdel-Rahmans wake up early and prepare for
their trip. The Al Amin Express is at their front door at 7 a.m.,
waiting for them to hop in. Neima and her 15-year-old sister, Muna,
wipe away tears as they say goodbye to their girlfriends.</TE>
<TE>   Throngs of women and children dressed in colorful clothes run
behind the red bus as it takes off. Muna and Neima begin to sob.
Marwa can't seem to hide her smile.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Amin Express stops at a so-called transit center in the
middle of the camps to join the remainder of the convoy: 16 buses, 33
trucks of luggage, six trucks of livestock and five spare vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 300 families--621 people in all--are making the trip. The
overwhelming majority of them were born in Sudan or spent most of
their lives there. Of the 160,000 Eritrean refugees living in the
Sudanese camps last year, about 50,000 have returned in the last few
months, according to Sikanda.</TE>
<TE>   Many refugees say they will not return until the young nation of
Eritrea is more stable. Recent arrests of Eritrean journalists and
activists add to their anxiety. The Eritrean government, which has
been criticized by Western governments for being authoritarian, has
assured the refugees that they'll be safe, but many don't believe
that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go back when the government changes," says 74-year-old Osman
Abdullah, who has lived in a neighboring refugee camp since 1970.
"There is no freedom there."</TE>
<TE>   But as the Al Amin Express rolls out of the transit center, the
Abdel-Rahmans say they have no such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes Are High</TE>
<TE>   The Abdel-Rahmans have brought their most valuable belongings: a
battery-operated clock and two portable radios wrapped in cloth to
protect them from the sand that blows through the bus.</TE>
<TE>   It's about 95 miles from the Shagarab camp to Tessenei, where the
Abdel-Rahmans will be resettled. The journey will take about eight
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Elkhair, at 23 the oldest Abdel-Rahman child making the trip,
recalls how his father would tell him stories about his hometown near
Asmara where tall trees swayed atop green hills. He is looking
forward to seeing them.</TE>
<TE>   Elkhair is unfazed by the prospect of doing two years' mandatory
military service in Eritrea. He has dreamed of becoming a doctor ever
since he saw a German aid doctor repair his sister's broken hand.
After military service, he hopes to enroll in university, then
medical school.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Amin Express coughs its way through the sun-baked desert
plain, past the goatskin tents of the Rashaidas, a Bedouin tribe that
migrated from the Saudi Arabian peninsula 150 years ago. Rashaida
men, some of them dressed in bright purple galabias, drive herds of
goats and camels across a grass-less field.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, the bus veers off the paved road and begins to follow
mud tracks through fields where sorghum is planted for some months of
the year. This is the road to the Sudan-Eritrea border and Talatasher
in Eritrea.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Amin Express is filled with dust kicked up by the vehicles
leading the convoy. Neima and her sisters cover their faces with
scarves to keep from coughing.</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour later, the convoy nears the frontier and Abdel-Rahman
flashes a broad grin.</TE>
<TE>   But Marwa is feeling no jubilance.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the border?" she asks, searching for the imaginary line
that separates Sudan from the land of her father's birth.</TE>
<TE>   The bus begins to bounce as if its wheels have turned into
jackhammers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is it! This is it!" an excited Abdel-Rahman says.</TE>
<TE>   "This is it?" asks Marwa, her voice expressing incredulity. "This
is a pile of rocks. Sudan is better."</TE>
<TE>   But Abdel-Rahman won't let his joyous spirit be dampened. He
stands in the moving bus, whirls around and announces to everyone,
with tears streaming down his face: "Yesterday I was a refugee, but
today I'm an Eritrean."</TE>
<TE>   After eight hours, the Express arrives in Tessenei. The
Abdel-Rahmans disembark and prepare to spend the night on some grass
mats in a transit center before leaving for their new home. The
center is overflowing. Other refugees make their beds outside.</TE>
<TE>   Some begin to wonder whether Eritrea is ready to welcome home tens
of thousands of refugees. The country will receive nearly $20 million
from the U.N. refugee agency during the next two years to dig wells,
build schools and establish clinics for the returnees. But some
people ask whether that is enough.</TE>
<TE>   Guglielmo Verdirame, a refugee expert at Oxford University, said
small countries such as Eritrea are hard-pressed to cope with massive
numbers of returnees.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no different than having hundreds of thousands of new
immigrants showing up overnight in a country," Verdirame said. "And
re-integration is much more difficult than integration."</TE>
<TE>   Abdel-Rahman is upbeat when he arrives. He could have chosen to
relocate his family to his village near Asmara, but his children
don't speak Tigrinya, the main language in Eritrea's highland region.
In Tessenei, the children can attend Arabic-language schools.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the family wakes early. The Abdel-Rahman girls
feed their chickens and return them to their small coop that is
placed on a truck with the family's belongings.</TE>
<TE>   The truck takes the family to their new home in a resettlement
camp known as "4x4." It has probably been named 4x4 because one needs
a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get there.</TE>
<TE>   The truck driver and his assistants unload the family's belongings
at the edge of the camp, then drive away.</TE>
<TE>   The 4x4 camp resembles the Abdel-Rahmans' Shagarab
neighborhood--except it is bleaker.</TE>
<TE>   Abdel-Rahman suddenly realizes that his social network is gone. He
and his family are now on their own in a new place. It seems even
hotter and drier than in Shagarab.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, Sikanda, the U.N. refugee agency official, warned
the returnees that the first two days of resettlement were the most
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   After several hours, Abdel-Rahman can't find any water, schools or
mosques nearby. A new neighbor tells him that the nearest water
supply is several miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Abdel-Rahman fishes into the pocket of his white galabia in which
he is carrying the equivalent of $40--his life's savings. He hands
the neighbor some Sudanese dinars and asks him to buy a few bottles
of water for his children.</TE>
<TE>   "I was living an easy life in Sudan. I was spoiled. I used to
shower and clean up several times and whenever I want, and now there
is no water available," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told that water would be supplied to you as soon as you
reach your place, and up to now we received none.</TE>
<TE>   "I really regret coming home," he says, his eyes downcast. "This
area is so far and remote."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses, then reconsiders: "But in the end, home is home."</TE>
<TE>   Fatma and the children are quiet. They arrange their belongings.</TE>
<TE>   They wonder aloud whether they're going to sleep outdoors tonight.
It's impossible to build a tukul today, Elkhair says.</TE>
<TE>   But then the Abdel-Rahmans begin to rally around one another.
Fatma breaks some brown bread and prepares an evening meal, while
Abdel-Rahman and Elkhair rearrange the beds.</TE>
<TE>   Neima releases the chickens from the coop and introduces them to
their new home. She pulls her black scarf over her head to shield her
from the 120-degree heat. A strong wind begins to kick up a small
dust storm.</TE>
<TE>   She ponders her new life and, as if speaking to the wind, says:
"I'm not afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Maharaj was recently on assignment in Sudan and Eritrea.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Fails to Block Torture Inspections</HD>
<DH>Rights: Unrestricted checks of prisons would be uncon-
stitutional, Americans say. But other U.N. members prevail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>In its latest split with its usual allies here, the United States
tried but failed Wednesday to block adoption of a new treaty
authorizing on-site international inspections of prisons suspected of
being used for torture.</LD>
<LD>   Arguing that unrestricted prison inspections could conflict with
safeguards in the Constitution's Fourth Amendment against
"unreasonable searches" and impinge on state control of most American
prisons, U.S. diplomats said the draft treaty as written is
"seriously flawed" and should be revised.</LD>
<LD>   But as proponents repeatedly noted in the debate here, the
provisions apply only to countries that sign and ratify the treaty.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials also acknowledged that they are concerned that the
treaty could allow foreign critics to visit American military jails,
including the detention center at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, now holding prisoners from the Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the U.S. objections, the treaty was approved by a General
Assembly committee on a 35-8 vote, with 10 abstentions. In an earlier
vote of 29 to 15, with eight abstentions, the committee rejected an
American-backed amendment that would have forced new negotiations on
the treaty, which was drafted after 10 years of protracted talks in
which the United States was an active participant.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to reject the U.S. position," said a delegate from South
Africa. "This optional protocol has been worked on for 10 years, and
I don't think we should wait another 25 years to reach complete
consensus."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. amendment was opposed by all European committee members
and all but one of the Latin American representatives. The exception,
in an unusual alliance, was the ambassador from Cuba, which also
adamantly opposes international visits to its prisons and was the
most vocal supporter of the U.S. position here.</TE>
<TE>   The United States also drew support from China, India, Japan
and--in a recent shift--Australia, which has drawn fire for its
detention policies on refugees.</TE>
<TE>   In General Assembly forums--in contrast to the Security
Council--the United States does not enjoy veto power.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty is technically an optional "protocol" or amendment to a
1987 international treaty banning torture, which has been ratified by
130 countries, including the United States. Human rights advocates
had long argued that without inspections of alleged torture centers,
the 1987 treaty could not be enforced.</TE>
<TE>   The protocol's authors have argued that its targets are countries
where torture is routinely employed against accused criminals and
political dissidents alike--not nations with independent judiciaries
and democratically administered penal systems such as the United
States. But at U.N. forums in the past, some European countries have
backed calls from human rights groups for international observers to
report on the use of chains, manacles and other restraints used on
violent felons and on work crews in U.S. prisons.</TE>
<TE>   The protocol was first approved earlier this year by the
Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Commission, and then submitted here
this week to the Economic and Social Council, a standing committee of
the General Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The protocol is now expected to be submitted for final
ratification to the entire 190-member U.N. General Assembly, where
majority approval is anticipated. The protocol would come into force
after it had been adopted by the assembly and formally ratified by
the legislatures of 20 nations.</TE>
<TE>   An international group of legal experts would then be authorized
"to establish a system of regular visits undertaken by independent
and national bodies to places where people are deprived of their
liberty, in order to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment and punishment."</TE>
<TE>   The move to block approval of the U.N. torture protocol was
criticized by European and other diplomats here as another example of
resurgent American unilateralism.</TE>
<TE>   For most of this month, the Security Council was embroiled in a
battle over U.S. opposition to the International Criminal Court, with
European proponents of the court only reluctantly acceding to U.S.
demands that American peacekeepers be exempted from the new
tribunal's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   And Monday, the United States became the only country ever to
rescind its pledged contributions to the U.N. Population Fund,
contending that the money could be indirectly used to promote
coercive family planning practices in China.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding to halt U.S. financing for the U.N. agency, the Bush
administration was overriding a recent State Department report
defending the U.N. Population Fund's programs in China and
recommending a continuation of U.S. financial support.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the European Union, criticizing the U.S. decision,
voted to provide the U.N. agency $32 million of the $34 million that
had been cut by the administration.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Founder, 2 Sons Are Charged With Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable pioneer John Rigas and two of his sons were arrested Wednesday
and accused of looting Adelphia Communications Corp. and treating it
as their "personal piggy bank," the latest development in one of the
largest accounting scandals to rock Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities arrested Rigas, the 77-year-old founder of Adelphia,
and his sons Timothy, 46, and Michael, 48, in New York. They also
arrested two other former executives in Pennsylvania and charged all
five with several counts of securities, wire and bank fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Among the allegations are that Rigas and his former Adelphia
executives hid $2.3 billion in personal loans guaranteed by the
company and inflated corporate earnings and the number of cable
subscribers. The 68-page criminal complaint details rampant
self-dealing by the Rigases, who allegedly used corporate funds to
start construction of a $50-million golf course on family land, buy
luxury condominiums in New York, Colorado and Mexico, and take an
African safari vacation.</LD>
<TE>   "The scheme charged in the complaint is one of the largest and
most egregious frauds ever perpetrated on investors and creditors,"
said James Comey, the U.S. attorney in New York.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Postal Inspector Thomas F.X. Feeney said the Rigases took
money from Adelphia "on a massive scale, using the company as the
Rigas family's personal piggy bank at the expense of public investors
and creditors."</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors said they declined the Rigases' offer to turn
themselves in. Instead, U.S. postal inspectors, involved in the case
because of the wire-fraud charges, arrested the three Rigases at 6
a.m. at the apartment of Ellen Rigas, John's daughter, on Manhattan's
Upper East Side.</TE>
<TE>   The luxury apartment is owned by the cable company and was used
free by Ellen and her husband from 1998 until May, according to the
criminal suit.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, the nation's sixth-biggest cable company and the largest
provider in Southern California, filed for bankruptcy protection last
month amid a cash crisis. The accounting scandal came to light in
late March.</TE>
<TE>   The five defendants, who resigned from Adelphia under pressure in
May, each could face millions of dollars in fines and up to 20 years
in prison as a result of the criminal and civil fraud charges brought
in separate lawsuits Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Another of John Rigas' sons, James, 44, former head of strategic
planning for Adelphia, was not named in the criminal case, but he was
cited in the civil case brought by the SEC. Adelphia also was named
in the civil suit for failing to cooperate with an SEC inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Adelphia filed its own lawsuit against the five
former executives and other Rigas family members, including Ellen and
John's wife, Doris. The suit charges the defendants with violating
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the multitude of misdeeds makes the case
unusual. The complaints detail how the Rigases allegedly manipulated
the books to conceal the firm's growing debt using sham transactions,
phony receipts and falsified documents provided to accounting firm
Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said the charges are evidence that the
administration is not afraid to crack down on corporate wrongdoing.
"This government will investigate, will arrest, and will prosecute
corporate executives who break the law."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests are the fourth prosecution in recent months stemming
from corporate scandals that have shaken investor confidence and
contributed to a plunge in stock values. Last month, Enron Corp.'s
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty of obstructing
justice in the government's investigation of the energy firm.
Criminal charges have been brought against former executives at Tyco
International Ltd. and ImClone Systems Inc. on tax evasion and
insider trading, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the speed with which the charges were brought
against Adelphia's top executives and their public arrests indicated
the government's desire to make an example of the Rigases.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally with white collar criminals, an arrangement is made
for them to come in the back door so they are fingerprinted and
photographed in a dignified manner," said Stephen M. Ryan, a former
federal prosecutor who is a partner at law firm Manatt, Phelps &amp;
Phillips in Washington. "It's unusual to do a 'perp walk' with a
white-collar crime," in which suspects are paraded in handcuffs in
front of TV cameras.</TE>
<TE>   At lunchtime Wednesday, Adelphia employees piled into Kaye's
Hometown Restaurant down the street from the company's headquarters
in Coudersport, Pa., to watch TV news footage showing members of the
founding family being handcuffed that morning in Manhattan. "There
was dead silence," said local journalist Don Gilliland. "It was a
little like watching 9/11--people just couldn't believe what they
were seeing."</TE>
<TE>   Until the off-balance-sheet loans first were disclosed by Timothy
Rigas in March, townspeople revered the Rigas family and John in
particular, whom they considered a hero for decades of generosity.
Gilliland said many of the town's 3,000 residents have turned against
John Rigas. "They're now saying he did it and he deserves to be
punished, without a lot of ifs."</TE>
<TE>   John Rigas, Adelphia's former chairman and chief executive;
Timothy Rigas, the former chief financial officer; and Michael Rigas,
former executive vice president of operations, were arraigned
Wednesday afternoon and each was released on a $10-million bond after
a half-hour hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases also pledged four properties as collateral, including
the family home in Coudersport, where two of the sons also live, and
5,000 acres of nearby land.</TE>
<TE>   John Rigas appeared tired and gaunt as he was led into the
courtroom. He wore a blue suit and white dress shirt, but his tie,
belt and shoelaces had been removed by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas did not speak during the hearing and refused to answer
reporters' questions afterward. The three executives could face
prison terms of 15 1/2 to 19 1/2 years if convicted, said Timothy
Coleman, an assistant U.S. attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, the Rigases' attorneys said their clients
broke no laws. "Do they think they committed crimes? The answer is
no," said Rigas attorney Peter Fleming, adding that John Rigas has
never sold any of his Adelphia stock.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to defend the charges vigorously," said Jeremy Temkin,
an attorney for Timothy Rigas.</TE>
<TE>   The two other Adelphia executives, James Brown, 40, former vice
president for finance, and Michael Mulcahey, 45, former assistant
treasurer, were arrested at their homes in Coudersport on Wednesday.
They were released on their own recognizance from a court in
Williamsport, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   When the cable industry was peaking in the late '90s, John Rigas
was worth billions on paper. He'd had a humble start, overdrawing his
bank account in 1952 to buy the Coudersport cable franchise for $300.
He already owned the movie theater in town and saw his cable
investment as a hedge against the threat of television.</TE>
<TE>   Even as other cable pioneers were selling out in the mid-1990s,
Rigas refused, eager to pass the company to his three sons, who were
pushing him to expand aggressively. After a shopping spree in the
late 1990s, Adelphia tripled its size, to 5.8 million subscribers
nationwide. Its biggest acquisition was the $5.2-billion purchase of
Century Communications Corp., the largest provider in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   With these acquisitions, however, came a towering debt load that
made Adelphia vulnerable when news of the questionable
off-balance-sheet loans emerged in March. Wall Street already was
jittery because of the Enron accounting scandal, and within weeks
Adelphia's stock collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   With bankruptcy looming and the family loans backed by Adelphia
climbing to $3.1 billion, John Rigas and his sons stepped down and
put their controlling 60% stake in the company into a trust voted by
outside Adelphia board members. Since then, Adelphia has been run by
these directors, including Erland Kailbourne, the interim CEO. The
directors have claimed that many of the Rigas transactions were not
approved or disclosed to the board.</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne was in Southern California this week trying to calm
city officials, regulators and employees who are nervous about the
company's ability to serve its 1.2 million customers in the region.</TE>

<LD>Just as Charlie Sheen's stockbroker in the movie "Wall Street" was
hauled in handcuffs across an ersatz trading room floor, the
early-morning rousting of Adelphia founder John Rigas on Wednesday
was rich with the symbolism of scorn for what many have come to view
as a new age of greed.</LD>
<LD>   Many victims of the stock market declines and corporate layoffs
have wanted to see at least one corporate chieftain suspected of
wrongdoing in handcuffs. And the arrest of the white-haired Rigas
served up a big helping.</LD>
<LD>   With none of the deference typically afforded such masters of the
universe, the corporate executive was subjected to a surprise arrest
at his New York apartment, placed in handcuffs and marched outside.
The scene, captured by television cameras, was the kind of "perp
walk" usually reserved for heinous murder and sex-crime suspects.</LD>
<TE>   The arrests of Rigas, two of his sons and two associates for
allegedly looting $1 billion from the company were "a clear message
to corporate wrongdoers that handcuffs and a jail cell await those
who violate the trust placed in them," said William Kezer, head of
the New York federal Postal Inspection Service, which took the
suspects into custody.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest was so widely publicized that it was credited as a
possible factor in the stock market's tremendous surge Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrest in and of itself demonstrates that the government and
this administration is going to use these guys as an example," said
former prosecutor J. Michael Nolan Jr., a white-collar criminal
defense lawyer with Lowenstein Sandler in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a question of stabilizing the markets and stabilizing
public confidence," he said. "I'm sure the White House has someone
who was monitoring every part of this case and said, 'If you've got a
big case and can bring it now, bring it. These guys aren't going to
get away with this stuff.' "</TE>
<TE>   Among white-collar and celebrity suspects, such arrests are about
as common as 100-year floods.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of Philadelphia 76ers basketball star Allen Iverson.
Iverson was allowed to turn himself in earlier this month after
allegedly barging into an apartment with a handgun looking for his
wife.</TE>
<TE>   In making such a public show of Rigas' arrest, federal authorities
took a page from the book of one of New York's most famous
prosecutors, Rudolph W. Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   It was under Giuliani that a stunned Wall Street watched as agents
cuffed several executives for alleged criminal activity. Those
dramatic arrests came after criticism that Ivan Boesky, accused of
insider trading, got kid-glove treatment.</TE>
<TE>   High-profile arrests are executed for a variety of reasons,
including a decision by a prosecutor or an arresting officer that the
suspect deserves the humiliation, said Harold Krent, dean of the
Chicago-Kent College of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason, he said, is to make a point.</TE>
<TE>   "This may get people to stop and stand up and take notice in a
kind of crude and blunderbuss way," Krent said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some say you need occasionally to make a very public statement
that society won't tolerate white-collar cheating because it has a
high societal cost," he said. "It may not be a coincidence that this
comes in the wake of all the revelations about Enron, WorldCom and
Global Crossing. We are much more willing as a country to denunciate
and heap our scorn on those who perhaps are responsible for the
economy beginning to nose-dive."</TE>
<TE>   But the use of arrests for goals other than furthering a
prosecution has been criticized as unfair, Krent said. "Some people
find it immoral, because we are taking advantage of one person to
drive a point home."</TE>
<TE>   Rigas' lawyers had attempted to arrange for their client to
surrender on his own accord--quietly and privately. Instead, Rigas,
looking dazed, ended up on television in footage that played
throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   "All [prosecutors] had to do was call their attorneys up and say,
'An indictment is coming down tomorrow and we want your client to be
in court' " today, Nolan said. "That would have been normal. These
guys aren't a flight risk. They have too many assets in the United
States. Where are these guys going?"</TE>
<TE>   If flight was not a factor, the only reason to make a spectacle of
Rigas' arrest was to send a message to investors and corporate
executives that white-collar criminal prosecution is no longer
business as usual, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   With corporate scandals driving investors away from the stock
market, they said, Rigas' showy arrest may be only the beginning of a
vigorous prosecutorial and public relations campaign against
corporate malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   "They might have wanted to show ... 'It's a new day, corporate
America--look out. We will come after you,' " said Sandra Jordan, a
law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a former federal
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   One reward prosecutors may hope to reap from the arrests is
information from whistle-blowers at other corporations who believe
their calls might result in action, lawyers said. The arrest also
might prompt executives with legal problems to come forward more
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's likely to shake up other similarly situated individuals,"
Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a new environment. We've got the corporate community
really looking at itself, [saying]: 'Do we need to 'fess up? Do we
need to try to cut deals before the government finds out what's going
on?' "</TE>
<TE>   The nature of Rigas' arrest also sends a signal that prosecutors
believe they have a strong case.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing a prosecutor would want to do is to make a big
splash and then lose the case," said Scott Michel, a white-collar
criminal defense lawyer with Caplin &amp; Drysdale in Washington.</TE>

<HD>Looking to Corporate America to Change From Within</HD>
<DH>Business: Though new laws will help to restore confidence,
financial markets are demanding tougher steps to curb abuses, experts
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ and DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Business reforms being readied by Congress will help ease the crisis
of confidence enveloping corporate America, but the financial markets
will play as big a role in curbing future scandals, observers said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   House and Senate negotiators agreed Wednesday on legislation that
would increase oversight of the accounting industry and impose
stiffer penalties for corporate fraud, clearing the way for Congress
to send the bill to President Bush this week for his expected
approval. The bill also includes myriad other new rules, such as a
requirement that top executives certify their companies' financial
results.</LD>
<LD>   Several observers said better enforcement of existing laws, rather
than passing new laws or adding stiffer penalties, would be the best
deterrent against civil and criminal wrongdoing by corporate
executives. The bill's proposal to boost regulators' budgets also
would help, they said.</LD>
<TE>   But "the market itself will ultimately reform things," said
Charles Elson, head of the Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware. For example, he pointed out that stock
exchanges and institutional investors had called for independent
board directors before that became part of Congress' bill, and said
"the market is way ahead" in demanding change.</TE>
<TE>   "The keys are independent boards, independent auditors and
criminal prosecution of those who intentionally violate the law,"
Elson said. "That's how this stuff goes away."</TE>
<TE>   Some specialists in corporate ethics were especially skeptical of
Congress' decision to boost penalties for corporate fraud, saying
such increases do little to curb white-collar crime.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have an impact on much of anything but plea bargains,"
said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a Web site devoted
to corporate governance issues.</TE>
<TE>   Minow said new rules proposed by the New York Stock Exchange, and
expected to be voted on next month, go further to curb abuses. Those
rules include increasing the independence of corporate boards, and in
particular audit committees. Congress' bill is "a promising first
step," she said, "but the impact of this legislation will be
limited."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, observers generally agreed that Congress' reforms would
be one more deterrent to any executive who thinks about cooking the
books.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was endorsed by the Business Roundtable, an organization
of the nation's chief executives, because it "will help restore
investor trust and put the financial markets on the road to
recovery," the group's chairman, John Dillon, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Ted White, director of corporate governance at the California
Public Employees' Retirement System, known as CalPERS, said the
massive pension fund supports reform.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased to see it go through," he said of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The WorldCom Inc. collapse and recent stock market dives helped
spur things along, White said.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally was very frustrated that until WorldCom it seemed
like we were banging our heads against the wall," he said. "But it
seems in the last few weeks they've been falling all over themselves
trying to get the reforms through."</TE>
<TE>   Congress' crackdown "if nothing else also certainly gets the
attention of board members and officers of public companies," said
Joe Goodwin, chief executive of Goodwin Group, an executive search
firm in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was no coincidence that the Dow Jones industrial
average soared nearly 500 points on the day Congress came close to
passing its bill and authorities arrested several executives of
Adelphia Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "Today sent a very clear signal that the laws are going to be
enforced," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some say Congress' overhaul still would not have been enough
to stop the accounting irregularities at Enron Corp. and other
scandal-ridden firms.</TE>
<TE>   "What could have prevented Enron was an independent board," Elson
said. "Active fraud is very hard to detect, and the way you detect
fraud is to punish people who engage in fraud. We've long had the
ability to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, one of Congress' new proposals--a plan to create an
independent board that would oversee the corporate accounting field
and discipline wayward auditors--drew applause for helping to shore
up investors' damaged trust.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS views the issue of auditor independence as a keystone of
the bill, White said, but he remains convinced that funding for such
a board must come from an independent source without industry ties.
That issue is still unclear, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The devil is in the details, and there is no better example than
this one," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the marketplace is the fountainhead of reform, Congress
gets credit for potentially lessening the ability of executives to
put their companies at risk through financial shenanigans, said David
Bowman, head of TTG Consultants/Lincolnshire, a workplace consulting
firm in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of workers have lost their jobs, their retirement
savings or both because of the collapses of Enron, WorldCom, Global
Crossing Ltd. and other firms that used questionable accounting to
mask financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got people out on the street with 401(k)s that are
virtually worthless," Bowman said. "People out on the street through
no fault of their own."</TE>

<HD>Stock Market Executes an Abrupt About-Face</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The Dow's best gain in 15 years does not mean
the sell-off has ended, experts caution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dramatic stock market turnaround lifted the Dow Jones index to its
best one-day gain in 15 years Wednesday, as the arrest of Adelphia
Communications Corp. executives and congressional action on a
corporate reform bill buoyed investors' spirits.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials turned a morning loss into a 488.95-point
gain, to 8,191.29, by the end of trading. It was the index's
second-largest jump ever in terms of points, and the 6.4% rise was
the biggest daily percentage advance since 1987.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the surge, many experts remained reluctant to declare an
end to the long bear market, the worst in a generation. They said
Wall Street was primed for a rebound after nine weeks of almost
relentless selling.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, the rally provided a welcome respite from the gloom that
has enveloped the market and driven many shares to their lowest
levels in at least five years.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said House and Senate negotiators' agreement on corporate
reform legislation--as well as the televised arrests of John Rigas
and other executives at the heart of the Adelphia accounting
scandal--helped lift investors' moods after months of headlines about
widespread corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in Washington was very important for the markets,"
said Subodh Kumar, strategist at CIBC World Markets in New York.
"Even [Federal Reserve Chairman Alan] Greenspan has acknowledged that
the market's checks and balances failed us. Now the market is saying,
'We want reform--we want those failures to be addressed.' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Diane Keefe, manager of the Pax World High Yield Bond fund in
Portsmouth, N.H.: "The arrests sent a signal to investors--the guys
with the white hats came in to clean things up. Having been recently
burned by Adelphia, I'm one of many who are pleased to see the wheels
of justice turning rapidly."</TE>
<TE>   As trading opened Wednesday, it appeared that the market was
headed for new lows. The Dow initially fell 170 points, extending its
loss during the last nine weeks to 2,450 points, or nearly 25%.</TE>
<TE>   But buyers quickly swarmed into the market, and the rally built up
steam through the day. By the close, New York Stock Exchange trading
volume had set a record.</TE>
<TE>   Every major market index resurged. The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's
500 rallied 5.7%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
jumped 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Among big-name stocks, banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.
gained $3.22 to $23.30, drug titan Merck &amp; Co. rose $3.55 to $42.60,
and retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. was up $2.84 to $47.94.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow's percentage gain, at 6.4%, was the biggest since the
index surged 10.2% on Oct. 21, 1987, rebounding from the record Oct.
19 dive of 22.6%.</TE>
<TE>   But experts warned that Wednesday's rally provided no assurance
that the 28-month-old bear market has ended. Potent but short-lived
rallies are common during continuing market declines, as bullish
investors temporarily gain the upper hand and short-term traders go
along for the ride.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as July 5, the Dow soared 324 points.</TE>
<TE>   "The market was incredibly oversold, and you can only stretch the
rubber band so far before it snaps back," said Russ Koesterich, U.S.
equity strategist at State Street Global Markets in Boston. So-called
short covering also fueled the day's rally, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Short sellers are traders who bet on lower stock prices by
borrowing shares and selling them, expecting to buy them back at a
lower price later. In a market rally, short sellers can rush in to
buy stocks to close out their bets. That can help drive prices higher
for a time.</TE>
<TE>   Many individual investors said they remained skeptical that share
prices had hit bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "You have one day where it zooms up. It gives people investing in
the stock market some confidence," said Robert Wall, 21, an intern at
the mayor's office of workforce development in downtown Los Angeles,
who shifted his money from stocks to bonds in March. "Although this
is very reassuring, it's not going to be a factor that says I'm going
to get into the market right now."</TE>
<TE>   Said Allan Spring, a 45-year-old computer programmer in Irwindale:
"There's been other times too when it's been a good day on the
market, but then the next couple of days eat up all those gains."</TE>
<TE>   Small investors have been adding to the market's losses in recent
weeks by pulling money out of stock mutual funds, forcing fund
managers to dump shares.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say one factor working against a sustained rally is that
investors who haven't sold, and now regret watching their losses
deepen during the last few months, will be tempted to exit if stocks
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Someone who bought stock of computer networking giant Cisco
Systems Inc. in 2000 for more than $50 a share, for example, might
hesitate to sell now at $13, but he could be tempted to cut his
losses and run if a rally takes it to $20 or $30.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Wednesday's surge, the Dow is down 18.3% this year. The
S&amp;P 500 is down 44.8% from its record high set in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Koesterich said today's trading would offer crucial clues about
the market's near-term direction.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen several large, abrupt rallies recently, but what's
been lacking is a follow-through rally on respectable trading
volume," he said. "For this to be anything more than a one-day
wonder, investors are going to have to show some conviction."</TE>
<TE>   After the market closed, AOL Time Warner Inc. became the latest
company to say the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into
its accounting--a reminder that worries about the truthfulness of
corporate books still abound.</TE>
<TE>   And more fundamental problems also dog stocks: Share prices remain
high, historically, compared with underlying corporate earnings. And
questions about the economy's strength in the second half of this
year raise doubts about how good earnings will be.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said investors might be disappointed if more
executive arrests are not made in coming months, such as in
high-profile scandals involving Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and
others.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the government is confiscating some other people's
passports, because if we don't see more indictments, something is
seriously wrong," said Jay Ritter, finance professor at the
University of Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some individual investors called Wednesday's arrests a step
toward making executives more accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good that they're finally going after people that
are corrupt, that hurt everybody else--people that end up losing all
their money," said Marsha Bartholomew, a 58-year-old bank manager in
Laguna Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the congressional compromise on the corporate reform
bill was seen as a move toward restoring investor confidence, though
not a cure-all.</TE>
<TE>   "The reform bill is an important step forward but not the whole
enchilada," said Tim Smith, president of the Social Investment Forum
and vice president of "socially responsive" investing at Walden Asset
Management in Boston. Even so, he said, "in this period of tremendous
uncertainty, the market is going to respond positively to even
partial solutions."</TE>

<DL>LONE PINE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Today's athletes in the Badwater Ultramarathon are pampered, in a
perverse sense. While they run and walk 135 miles across Death
Valley, they are tailed by 24-hour-a-day crews in air-conditioned
vans. The support teams make them chicken soup on the side of the
road and hold up cups so they can sip energy drinks and Pedialytle,
to combat diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration.</LD>
<LD>   Sissies.</LD>
<LD>   In August 1977, Al Arnold did it alone.</LD>
<TE>   Trying to become the first person to run from Badwater in Death
Valley to Mt. Whitney, he was supposed to be trailed by a crew
member, photographer Erik Rakonen.</TE>
<TE>   But the two became separated on the course, so Arnold reversed
field and ran back 22 miles, finding his support man asleep in his
car.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't deter Al Arnold. He refused to hitch a ride back to
the point where he had turned back. He simply started running again.
About 84 hours and 192 miles later--wearing running shoes and
briefs--he made it. And the madness that would become known as "The
Badwater" was born.</TE>
<TE>   His feat caused a flurry of excitement in the running community,
but it was soon forgotten. Arnold wasn't even aware for many years
that his run had morphed into an annual race. Then, two years ago,
Badwater director Chris Kostman was researching the race and came
across Arnold's run. Kostman arranged for Arnold to attend his first
"official" Badwater this year, on the 25th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Now 74, gray-haired and paunchy, with a bum knee he blew out while
stooping to pick trash off the floor, Arnold welcomed a steady stream
of athletes during this week's race. Most wanted him to start his
tale from the top. And each time, he did.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, he heard about two men who completed a 150-mile relay
from below-sea-level Badwater to Mt. Whitney's 14,496-foot peak.
Arnold wanted to do it too--without a relay partner. After two failed
tries, he bounded off from Badwater on a 124-degree day.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, he approached Lone Pine, a town of about 3,000
that is the gateway to the highest peak in the lower 48 states. When
he reached the top, he wept uncontrollably. He had lost 17 pounds, or
8% of his body weight. But his journey wasn't over.</TE>
<TE>   He stumbled down to a campsite where friends had left warm clothes
and a tent to stay the night. But his gear had been stolen, he said,
and he spent the night in near-freezing temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, he was on his honeymoon. While he was
bodysurfing, a wave bulldozed him into the sand, leaving him
temporarily paralyzed below the neck.</TE>
<TE>   Again refusing to quit, he recovered quickly and ran a marathon
four months later. He stopped running two years ago, he said
Wednesday in Lone Pine, completing his tale just as the first of the
Badwater runners passed through town on the final leg of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, several racers have tracked him down. Arnold said
his favorite letter came two years ago from Jack Denness, a runner
from England who is competing this week in the race. The letter tried
to sum up the obsession that ultramarathons have become. "When I meet
you," it ended, "I don't know whether to shake your hand or wring
your neck."</TE>
<TE>   Explained Arnold: "Why is it that the moth is attracted to the
flame, when he knows if he gets too close it will burn him? ... It's
dangerous. But it's the search, the quest."</TE>
<TE>   Even the other pioneers revere the man who started it all.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Morris caught the Badwater bug after seeing two films near
his home in Marina del Rey. One was on marathon racing. The other was
on Arnold's run.</TE>
<TE>   Morris completed the run in 1983, becoming the second person to
repeat Arnold's achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought: Who the hell is Al Arnold?" said Morris, 63 and a
member of a Badwater racer's crew. "Then I saw [the film.] It was
like when you were a kid and you dreamed about being dropped from an
airplane into the wilderness with a knife in your teeth and just one
match. I thought, 'I have to do this'. And it changed my life."</TE>

<HD>Southland Is U.S. Leader in Beach Closures</HD>
<DH>Pollution: The region's shore had one in three of the
nation's beach shutdowns in 2001, up since 2000. Strict monitoring is

<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California is the "national epicenter" of coastal pollution,
with one in three U.S. beach closures and warnings occurring between
Rincon Beach in Ventura County and the Mexican border, a national
environmental group reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Natural Resources Defense Council's 12th annual "Testing the
Waters" study shows that beach closures and warnings due to pollution
were up across the nation and in California last year. Orange County
led the way with 1,592 closures and advisories in 2001--81% higher
than the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   Each of Southern California's four coastal counties had more
closures and warnings than any state. Health officials say California
leads the nation in testing coastal waters in a proactive effort to
safeguard the public.</LD>
<TE>   "It's true that part of that reality is because we do a better job
monitoring," said David Beckman, a senior attorney with the
environmental group's Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   But more than "5,000 closures and advisories in four counties is
still a significantly big problem by any manner of arithmetic," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Mazur, spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care
Agency, attributed much of the jump to the new practice of including
data from shorelines where creeks empty into the ocean. Creeks carry
urban runoff, and high bacteria counts tend to be found at their
mouths. The number of sewage spills that hit local beaches also rose
from 40 to 51, and resulted in more closures in 2001 than the
previous year, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Beckman said authorities in other states are following
California's lead, better monitoring coastal waters and alerting the
public when beaches are unsafe. Still, the council's report said
municipal agencies must do more to curb runoff from streets, homes
and businesses that is tainting coastal waters.</TE>
<TE>   Regional water regulators are imposing tougher restrictions on
such runoff. But builders and many cities and counties in Southern
California are fighting new measures, arguing that the cost is too
great and there is no proof the measures will prevent coastal
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Council officials said that argument is shortsighted.</TE>
<TE>   "The equation is devastatingly simple," Beckman said. "Pavement
causes pollution and pollution closes beaches."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hobbs, spokesman for the Coalition for Practical Regulations,
which represents 46 cities in Los Angeles County and is fighting new
runoff regulations there, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "You won't find one city official in Southern California who says,
'I don't support clean water,' " Hobbs said. "We are on the same side
as the environmentalists who are pushing for this. We want clean
water. But we don't think unsound and flimsy science is the way to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Solutions aside, the report documented 13,410 closures and
advisories at ocean and freshwater beaches across the nation in 2001,
a 19% increase over 2000. High bacteria levels, indicating the
presence of human or animal waste, prompted 87% of the closures and
warnings.</TE>
<TE>   In California, there were 6,568 closures and warnings, plus 13
extended and 36 permanent closures, a 14% increase over 2000 and the
fifth consecutive annual increase. Coastal tourism pours about $52
billion into the state's economy and supports 707,000 related jobs.</TE>
<TE>   More stringent monitoring requirements explain many of the early
increases, but testing standards have been stable in recent years,
council officials said. Health officials began monitoring 14 new
beaches, which led to 124 additional closures and advisories. More
rainfall in 2001 also was cited as a contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California accounted for most of the postings and
warnings. In addition to Orange County, Ventura County saw an 80%
jump in closures and postings, reporting 1,540 in 2001. In Los
Angeles, there was a 17% dip to 1,046, and San Diego saw a 31%
decline to 931. Beckman attributed the drops to year-to-year
variations, efforts to curb urban runoff such as a new treatment
facility in Santa Monica, and a change in how beaches are monitored
in San Diego County. Testing locations were moved from the mouths of
storm drains to a distance away, allowing runoff to be diluted before
the water is tested.</TE>
<TE>   Council officials praised the Los Angeles and San Diego Regional
Water Quality Control boards for enacting tough new runoff rules in
Los Angeles, Ventura, San Diego and southern Orange counties. Some
members of the two boards criticized cities, counties and builders
that are fighting the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-term good of the many must outweigh the short-term greed
of the few," said H. David Nahai, a member of the Los Angeles
Regional Water Quality Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   Builders and municipal officials said the rules are questionable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous to think anyone wants dirty water," said Tim
Piasky, director of environmental affairs for the Building Industry
Assn. of Southern California. The group supports regional solutions,
rather than regulating on a site-by-site basis.</TE>

<LD>Authorities linked a sexual assault in the Belmont Heights area of
Long Beach to a serial rapist that has been terrorizing east Long
Beach since 1997, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Undisclosed evidence collected in the June 26 rape of a
61-year-old woman confirms that her attacker is responsible for eight
other rapes in Long Beach and two in the west Orange County area,
Long Beach Police Officer Jana Blair said. Police also believe that
the attacker is responsible for the attempted rape of a Los Alamitos
woman in May.</LD>
<LD>   The attacker is believed to be about 5 feet 10 with a medium
build. He typically covers his victims' faces during an attack. He
generally rapes women he finds alone, and his victims' ages range
from 32 to 80.</LD>

<LD>A 32-year-old resident filed a $75-million legal claim against the
city of Inglewood on Wednesday, alleging that he was abused by
police. Neilson Williams said he suffers from physical and mental
damage from a run-in with Inglewood officers outside a park June 23.</LD>
<LD>   Williams said Officer Jeremy Morse, arrested for allegedly abusing
a boy July 6, was among those who left him unconscious. Williams, who
was hospitalized for three days, was not arrested.</LD>
<LD>   Inglewood police said the department's internal affairs team and
the district attorney are investigating, and did not comment other
than to say Williams sparked the confrontation.</LD>

<HD>Girl Found Dead Inside Father's Van</HD>
<DH>Crime: He is arrested on suspicion of murder after
allegedly leaving her for four hours.</DH>

<LD>A Fontana man was arrested on suspicion of murder Wednesday after his
3-year-old daughter was found dead in his van, where he allegedly
left her with the windows rolled up in 102-degree heat for up to four
hours.</LD>
<LD>   Police said John Morgan, 52, had been running errands with
Angelina Rose Morgan on Tuesday when he parked his Chevrolet Astro
van in his driveway on Mesa Drive, took groceries into the house and
went to sleep.</LD>
<LD>   He awoke several hours later, at 5:20 p.m., to his wife screaming,
police said.</LD>
<TE>   Rosa Morgan had found Angelina's body strapped in her car seat.
The temperature in the van may have reached 130 degrees, said Vicki
Aubry, a spokeswoman for the Fontana Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Martha Valles said she and her daughter heard the screams
and went outside.</TE>
<TE>   "She was screaming and running with her baby in her arms," Valles
said. John Morgan stood in the front yard looking stunned as his wife
ran to a house three doors down, Valles said.</TE>
<TE>   "The husband was out there, walking in circles. He didn't say
anything. He looked like he was just astonished, in shock," Valles
said. "But his wife was screaming. It was awful."</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Morgan knocked on a neighbor's door, but no one was home,
Valles said.</TE>
<TE>   "She screamed, 'Call the police, my daughter is dead,' " Valles
said. Several neighbors called police, who arrived in minutes, Valles
said, and the husband was led out of the house in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   He was booked on suspicion of murder, but prosecutors could reduce
the charge to manslaughter or wrongful death, Aubry said.</TE>
<TE>   Angelina was the second Southland child to die within a week in a
hot car.</TE>
<TE>   A 23-year-old Hacienda Heights woman was arrested Saturday after
allegedly leaving her 4-month-old son in a car for more than seven
hours at an undisclosed location in the San Gabriel Valley. Sheriff's
deputies said Roxanne Rodrigo's child died the previous Wednesday,
but she told no one. On Saturday, she led her father to her car and
showed him the body. She was arraigned this week on murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   In June in San Francisco, a 5-month-old died in a hot vehicle with
the windows rolled up. Her grandfather Lonnie Earl Sopko, 60, told
police he was supposed to supervise the child, but forgot she was in
his car.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a Simi Valley woman was sentenced to a year in county
jail after her sons, 3 years and 13 months, died in a sweltering van
in the family's driveway. Marlene Heath, 40, had fallen asleep in the
house after drinking wine.</TE>
<TE>   Also last year, in Rialto, a 3-year-old died after her foster
mother was distracted by the family's blind dog and left the child in
the car.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1999, two children died within two weeks, one in Temecula
and one in Claremont, both after being left in hot cars.</TE>
<TE>   In Fontana, neighbors said Angelina's father was usually with her
during the day because his wife often worked nights as a nurse.
Morgan worked at home, and used to ride his bicycle with Angelina in
a basket in the front.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, father and daughter would come outside to pick up the
mail. She was a noisy, exuberant little girl with short blond hair
and blue eyes, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Valles' husband, Carlos, expressed sympathy for Angelina's father.
"Poor man. He must be dying of sadness, locked up in jail and accused
of killing his little girl," Carlos Valles said. "I'm sure it was an
accident, a horrible tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   The Valleses said they visited Rosa Morgan late Tuesday before she
left for her mother's house.</TE>
<TE>   "She was crying, crying, crying. We told her to take care and to
accept this as the will of God," Carlos Valles said.</TE>

<HD>Fraud Charged in Sales to Military</HD>
<DH>Sun Valley: Firm and its owner are accused of providing
Army and Air Force with faulty rotor pins for helicopters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sun Valley company and its owner have been indicted on charges of
selling the Army and Air Force substandard rotor pins for the
workhorse UH-60 helicopter, which resulted in the temporary grounding
of the fleet used to ferry troops and supplies into battle, federal
prosecutors said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Harootunian, 48, of Glendale faces up to 10 years in prison
if convicted, and his company, Apex Manufacturing Inc., could be
fined $1 million.</LD>
<LD>   The problem came to light in 2000 when an Army medical unit in
Hawaii reported that many of the pins in its UH-60 Blackhawk choppers
were failing flight inspections because of corrosion and cracking.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Christine Adams, who is prosecuting the fraud
case, said that no crashes or mishaps occurred because of any faulty
pins.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the two armed services were forced to ground their
entire fleet of Sikorsky-built UH-60s for inspection so that
Apex-supplied pins could be replaced, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Harootunian's attorney, Donald Etra, said the criminal charges are
unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "All parts delivered to the government were believed to conform
explicitly to specifications," he said. "The documents from the
company verify this."</TE>
<TE>   Etra said the military has shown its "full faith" in Harootunian
by continuing to buy the same type of rotor pins from his company.</TE>
<TE>   The pins are used to secure the helicopter's four rotor blades to
the main rotor.</TE>
<TE>   Under its contract with the military, Apex was required to subject
the pins to very high temperatures for sustained time periods, a
process that increases hardness and resistance to corrosion.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charged that in July 1998, Harootunian shipped
3,467 rotor pins to the military without disclosing that an aluminum
alloy component had not been heat-treated according to contract
specifications.</TE>
<TE>   He also was accused of shipping another 130 substandard pins to
the military in September 1998.</TE>
<TE>   When confronted about the problem two years later, the indictment
said, Harootunian responded with a letter falsely claiming that the
pins had been "tested and accepted per customer requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Apex Manufacturing was located in North Hollywood at the time the
alleged offenses were committed. It now employs 14 people at its Sun
Valley plant.</TE>
<TE>   The UH-60 was designed to carry a crew of three and 11 troops or
about 9,000 pounds of cargo. It can be modified for medevac or
reconnaissance missions.</TE>
<TE>   Since it introduced the aircraft in 1978, Sikorsky has built and
sold about 2,500 of the choppers to all of the U.S. armed services
and to American allies around the world. The Army has about 1,600 in
its fleet.</TE>

<HD>123 Degrees, 135 Miles and Hours of Pain--a Case Study in
Endurance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEATH VALLEY</DL>
<LD>Five hours from Los Angeles, spitting distance from hell, Death
Valley's highest recorded temperature of 134 degrees was topped just
once, in Libya.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday it was a scant 123 as 79 invited athletes completed the
first day of the Badwater Ultramarathon, a 135-mile ordeal that tests
legs, lungs and reeling psyches.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the first runner finished Wednesday morning at more
than 8,000 feet on the haunches of Mt. Whitney, several competitors
had doubled over with dry heaves; one rolled in the desert dust, far
off the course; and another told of hallucinations--the flying
saucers seemed to just hang there, over the desert floor.</LD>
<TE>   Yet there were dozens of individual triumphs too--most notably the
first victory by a woman in the 25 years since the race began. Pam
Reed, 41, of Arizona arrived at Whitney Portal just before 10 a.m.,
winning one of the world's most grueling foot races in just under 28
hours.</TE>
<TE>   This raises obvious but still profound questions: Why? And, how?</TE>
<TE>   Enter a team of British researchers. Catching an early wave of an
evolving science, the scientists spent this week developing some of
the first psychological and physiological profiles of these
ultra-athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the British team believe mega-distance runners have
much to share--beyond, that is, making the outside world feel
remarkably sedentary.</TE>
<TE>   Exercise physiologists studied earlier generations of elite
athletes--confirming, for instance, the benefits of high-altitude
training. Now there is a new breed of athlete to offer clues about
the limits of human endurance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how we learn about humans," said one of the researchers,
Murray Griffin, a sports psychology lecturer at the University of
Essex. "If we want to study intelligence, you find the smartest
people out there. You study the extremes. It brings into focus what
normal people, so to speak, are like."</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, researchers from the Anglia Polytechnic
University in Cambridge took baseline tests of two racers: Marshall
Ulrich, 51, a pet food wholesaler from Colorado, and Lisa Smith-Batchen,
42, a personal trainer and coach from Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The tests, conducted in Las Vegas, created a profile of the
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Additional tests were being conducted this week during the event,
and a final round will be conducted at the finish line, 8,360 feet up
Mt. Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Ulrich and Smith-Batchen seemed like the right subjects--reaching
for goals extreme even within their rarefied subculture.</TE>
<TE>   Later this week, Smith-Batchen expects to complete her first
"double." After finishing the race sometime this morning, she'll turn
around and run back to the starting line in Death Valley, the lowest
point in the Western Hemisphere. (She's doing it for kicks and money,
soliciting donations for a religious order that assists impoverished
women and children.)</TE>
<TE>   That will be the equivalent of running nearly 10 consecutive
marathons, through the hottest territory in America.</TE>
<TE>   Ulrich topped even that feat a year ago--becoming the first person
to finish the Badwater course four times in a row. That took 10 days,
during which he slept an average of 1 1/2 hours a night.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he pulled another stunner--becoming the first
person to complete the race without a crew and support van. Ulrich
dragged his own gear, including 21 1/2 gallons of water, in a
212-pound cart. He finished in 77 hours, 48 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no guarantees this is healthy," said another of the
researchers, Dr. Ralph Beneke of the University of Essex. "There is
something different about them."</TE>
<TE>   But what? Racers themselves have a hard time explaining what they
get out of events like the Badwater. They often talk of "learning
about myself," but seem stumped when asked to explain further.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you climb Everest?" asked Ben Jones, a three-time Badwater
participant who is now the event's unofficial "mayor." "It's like
[explorer George] Mallory said: Because it's there. Well, the race is
here."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers are hoping to move beyond that explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Physically, among other things, they will study the athletes' body
temperatures, rate of dehydration and bodily functions. Also to be
examined are enzymes that indicate how certain cells die during the
race.</TE>
<TE>   Even preliminary results of the tests won't be available
for weeks. But the scientists are already on their way: They have
learned, for example, that Smith-Batchen and Ulrich have 20% higher
energy efficiency--measured by developing an index that combines
oxygen intake, carbon dioxide output and other factors--than other
distance runners.</TE>
<TE>   Mentally, the researchers will use standard diagnostic tests to
measure factors such as self-esteem. They will test cognitive
functioning by asking logic questions. For example, the athletes are
told that "A" precedes "B." Then they will be given the pattern
"AB"--which follows that equation--and will be asked to determine
whether that pattern is true or false. While obvious to a runner at
rest, such a simple test might baffle an athlete on the verge of
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The science is already producing a chicken-or-egg dilemma that no
one has solved: Are these athletes genetically predisposed to this
sort of endurance?</TE>
<TE>   The heart of bicycle racer Lance Armstrong, three-time winner of
the Tour de France, for example, is substantially larger than the
average heart. Was he born that way? Or has the muscle grown through
training, improving his ability to deliver blood and oxygen to his
body?</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, I don't think there's a whole lot that makes me that
different from anybody else," Ulrich said. "You just have a different
mind-set. There is a certain amount of suffering that goes on."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday evening, as she neared a checkpoint at Panamint Springs
and began her 58th mile, Smith-Batchen revealed little of that
suffering. But she conceded that Badwater is "a beast."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way to tame the desert," she said, walking briskly up
a steep grade. "You have to be able to dig in that well you've never
been to before."</TE>
<TE>   Breathing hard, Smith-Batchen passed mesquite shrubs, darting
lizards, towering cliffs and salt flats. The conundrum of the heat
feeds itself: As you breathe harder and faster, you suck in more air
that feels as if it has been expelled from the end of a hair dryer.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Smith-Batchen climbed into her crew's car for a quick
break.</TE>
<TE>   Four people swarmed over her like a pit crew at a car race,
massaging her legs, tending to her blistered feet, stuffing potato
chips in her mouth, readying a salt pill to help her retain water.</TE>
<TE>   She planned to go through nine pairs of shoes this week--gradually
shifting from size 9 1/2 up to a final pair of size 12s--to
accommodate her ever-swelling feet.</TE>
<TE>   When the final pair still isn't big enough, her team will cut off
the toes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've wanted to quit five times already," she said during her
10-minute break. "But I won't give in. I can't."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, 34-year-old Jay Batchen, is the taskmaster of
her crew, keeping tabs on everything his wife eats, drinks, wears and
says. He leaned into the car.</TE>
<TE>   "Put your shoes on," he said. "It's time."</TE>

<HD>How Irvine Got Navy on Board for El Toro Deal</HD>
<DH>Land: By negotiating to sell the former base in large
parcels, the city offered the military a quick out. Removing

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just three months ago, Irvine's vision of building a "Great Park" in
the heart of Orange County at the closed El Toro Marine base seemed
doomed.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy had announced that it would auction off the 4,738-acre
parcel, stunning city officials who had expected that the land would
be given to them to create the park after voters rejected an airport
in March. Even the staunchest park supporters had to concede the
possibility of a developer buying the base whole and building 30,000
homes on it.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday, Navy and city officials came out with a plan that
seemed to give Irvine everything it had hoped for, with more than 80%
of the base dedicated to parkland.</LD>
<TE>   So what happened in the past 90 days to change that scenario?</TE>
<TE>   In short, the city renowned for creating master-planned
communities brokered what it boasts is its most impressive land-use
deal yet.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of meetings and conference calls, Irvine officials
persuaded the Navy to sell the property only to buyers who would
agree upfront to deed more than 80% of the land they would buy over
to the park--an extraordinary concession that land-use experts say
will bring the bidding prices down significantly, slashing potential
revenues for the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine relied on negotiating skills developed over decades of
dealing with another large land owner: the Irvine Co. Also of help
was the Navy's eagerness to dispose of the site as soon as possible,
to avoid the base-reuse battles that have dragged on for years
elsewhere. El Toro had already become a problem for the military as
county politicians argued for a decade over whether to build an
airport there.</TE>
<TE>   "We told [Navy officials] that if they wanted to go down another
path, we couldn't make any guarantees," said Brian Myers, a
consultant to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a lot of time explaining to them how they could enhance
the value of their property, and putting candid information on the
table about the pulse of the local community."</TE>
<TE>   The city ultimately made the Navy an offer it couldn't refuse: It
would zone lucrative building rights on 738 acres of the base, where
developers would be able to build 3,400 homes and 2.9 million square
feet of retail space immediately. There would be no drawn-out
approval process, no project-by-project environmental impact reports
and no decade-long lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy could sell the parcels with development rights built in
and wash its hand of the process altogether. It was the quick end the
Navy was looking for.</TE>
<TE>   "The military does not want to be caretakers of these bases for a
long time," said Jeffrey Finkel, executive director of the National
Assn. of Installation Developers, a Washington-based group that helps
communities navigate base closures. "They are under a great deal of
pressure to sell as quickly as they can."</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Defense realized that their plan to make
billions of dollars off the closed bases is just not feasible,"
Finkel said.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to El Toro, some experts predict that the land sale
could bring in as little as a few hundred million dollars, since
developers will be buying the property knowing they will have to fund
not only the park land, but all the infrastructure and maintenance
costs associated with the park.</TE>
<TE>   And if the environmental problems are as immense as some fear, the
Navy's return will be cut significantly.</TE>
<TE>   The property has long been listed as a federal Superfund site. It
remains contaminated with jet fuel, radiological materials and other
hazardous waste. An underground plume of toxic materials already
threatens the ecological reserve at Upper Newport Bay, the
Environmental Protection Agency says.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials say that the base is 87% clean and that the
remaining toxic substances can be removed at minimal expense in the
next few years.</TE>
<TE>   But some environmental analysts warn that untold contamination
could cost as much to remove as the Navy makes on the land sale.</TE>

<TE>   "Everyone over the last 10 years has been so absorbed with whether
there would be an airport on the base that the hazardous-waste aspect
has been ignored," said Gregory Hurley of the county's El Toro
Restoration Advisory Board.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental attorney said the site investigation by the Navy
and the EPA is being done with an airport in mind. He said that
federal environmental officials have not looked under the asphalt and
in many of the areas where houses and playing fields will be built.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley said that the federal investigation relied on Navy records
instead of soil sampling. Wherever Navy records pinpointed toxic
material, the investigators ran tests. But other areas have been left
untested, even though Hurley said members of the county committee
walking around the base on their own have found radioactive material
the federal investigation failed to uncover.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also believes that a decade-old sewer system, over
which the park would be built, is leaking hazardous waste.</TE>
<TE>   "When these things remained capped in concrete, I wasn't that
concerned," Hurley said. "Now that they are going to be dug up and
interact with humans, I am deeply concerned."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say Hurley and those who share his concerns are
pro-airport advocates--something they deny--and that Irvine has found
no problems in its own review of the Navy's cleanup.</TE>

<HD>Principal Pleads Not Guilty to Hate Crimes Against Gays</HD>
<DH>Courts: Administrator is accused of harassing his lesbian
neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The principal of a San Fernando Valley vocational center pleaded not
guilty Wednesday to charges he committed hate crimes against his gay
neighbors earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Donald R. Gaskin, who has been on administrative leave from the
North Valley Occupational Center in Mission Hills since his arrest in
May, was represented in Municipal Court in Newhall on Wednesday by
attorney Pat Harris. Harris denied accusations that Gaskin had
harassed a lesbian couple by stealing their sprinklers and mail.</LD>
<LD>   Gaskin, who is free on $100,000 bail, faces 10 misdemeanor
charges, including civil rights violations, petty theft and vandalism
for incidents that allegedly occurred between January and May in the
Santa Clarita neighborhood of Princess Park.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, he could face up to one year in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Before entering Gaskin's plea, Harris submitted a motion to drop
the six hate crime counts, citing insufficient evidence.</TE>
<TE>   But Assistant Dist. Atty. Scott Millington said that since Gaskin
allegedly has a history of making disparaging comments about his
neighbors' sexual orientation, "the bias motivation is a substantial
factor in the facts of the trial."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Floyd V. Baxter decided there was sufficient information
about possible hate crimes to present the case to a jury.</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raiser's Fraud Draws Stiffest Sentence</HD>
<DH>Crime: The San Juan Capistrano man gets 8 years in prison,
must pay $2 million in restitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fund-raiser accused of bilking donors out of $27 million that was
supposed to go to injured firefighters, wounded veterans and others
in need was sentenced Wednesday to eight years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Gold, 44, has been the subject of numerous complaints and
investigations over the last decade, but Wednesday is the first time
he received prison time for his actions. Federal judge David O.
Carter handed down the maximum punishment and also ordered the San
Juan Capistrano man to pay $2 million in restitution.</LD>
<LD>   "You've committed illegal activities that should have been
prosecuted a long time ago," Carter told Gold. "You've caused a
ripple effect in the lake that is incredibly harmful ... Because of
you there are foster children with AIDS, veterans without legs, and
burn victims who will suffer ... You set a pretty high standard of
fraud."</LD>
<TE>   Gold pleaded guilty in March to mail fraud and money laundering in
connection with his fund-raising efforts. Prosecutors said that
although Gold claimed he was raising money for such causes as injured
lawmen, he kept all but a tiny percentage of the collections.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis of Gold's fund-raising in the late 1990s found
that charities received about 11% of the millions he raised. His
company's telephone pitches appealed to the heart, with operators
telling potential donors of young victims of fires whose scars will
"haunt them for years to come."</TE>
<TE>   More than two dozen of Gold's family members and friends attended
the hearing and many of them wept as Gold told the judge he was sorry
for his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to apologize to any and all of the victims and for any
pain I may have caused them by my bad decisions," Gold said. "I do
take full responsibility for all of my actions."</TE>
<TE>   Gold and his lawyer, Thomas Bienert, asked the judge for leniency,
saying that Gold was needed to help rear his children and care for a
sick relative.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, called for the stiffest sentence possible,
saying Gold's apologies were insincere. They pointed out that
attorneys general in five states have tried to stop Gold's
fund-raising with lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "He just keeps going; there is nothing that will stop this man,"
Assistant U.S. Atty. Ellyn Lindsay said. "The only thing he
understands is jail."</TE>
<TE>   In court Wednesday, several people spoke in favor of prison time
for Gold.</TE>
<TE>   A former Orange County prosecutor and a founder of the group
Charities for Truth in Giving, said Gold preyed on the elderly,
compiling a "golden sucker list" of donors who contributed at least
once a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Once [donors] found out what was going on, they never gave
again," Gay Sandoval said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold also admitted wrongdoing in a case involving a business that
sold golf clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Cohen, 29, of Tustin, one of Gold's business partners,
also has pleaded guilty to mail fraud and will be sentenced later.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Racers Are in the Homestretch</HD>
<DH>Greyhounds: Pilot logs 8,000 miles ferrying dogs slated for
death to adoption agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pilot Maggie McCurry has been flying for 16 years but she said she
has never traveled with the precious cargo she has carried during the
Great Greyhound Goodwill Air Tour.</LD>
<LD>   Her 24-day journey ended Wednesday at Van Nuys Airport when she
and two retired racing greyhounds emerged from her airplane that
McCurry dubbed the "Wings of Greyhounds."</LD>
<LD>   She flew the plane, packed with pillows and blankets for the
passengers' comfort, 8,000 miles, gathering 28 greyhounds, two or
three at a time.</LD>
<TE>   McCurry's rescue mission took her to 24 cities, including Boston,
Indianapolis and Tucson, to keep greyhounds from being euthanized
after they got too old to race.</TE>
<TE>   Greyhounds begin to slow when they are between 2 1/2 and 3 years
old, but the breed usually lives to be 12 years old, she said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the dogs she rescued were given to greyhound adoption
groups around the country, McCurry said.</TE>
<TE>   "Greyhounds only have two options at the end of their
careers--adoption or death," McCurry said.</TE>
<TE>   Most racetracks don't have adoption programs, and the dogs' owners
and trainers generally don't want them if they can't win races,
McCurry said.</TE>
<TE>   "If [a dog] is not making money, they don't even want to feed it,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   That's when groups like Greyhound Pets of America come in and
groom the animals, place them in foster homes and eventually find
people to adopt them, said Dana McNamar, a volunteer for the Orange
County and Greater Los Angeles chapter. He said the chapter found
homes for 220 greyhounds last year.</TE>
<TE>   McCurry, a former Studio City resident who now lives in Sedona,
Ariz., said she got involved with greyhounds six years ago when she
adopted her dog, Lanky Lance, who died last month. "You get tired of
just buzzing around the sky, flying to Santa Barbara for lunch," said
McCurry, a recreational flier. "I wanted to do something useful."</TE>
<TE>   She said she started a nonprofit group, Wings for Greyhounds Inc.,
and began the rescue flights, which cost about $200 an hour. The
group gets grant money and donations to pay for the trips.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great [seeing] their little faces and you know that they're
never going to have to race again or wear muzzles," McCurry said.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Brown, who runs the Acton-based adoption group Retired
Racers Inc., said greyhounds are surprisingly well-behaved animals.
"They seem to conform to pet life naturally," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her only suggestions for potential adopters are to have a leash on
the dog at all times, a fenced yard and to feed it twice a day. They
don't even need more exercise than any other dog, Brown said.
"They're just a great breed of dog."</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: (3 photos) Two retired greyhounds were among the
guests of honor at a reception at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys.
The event was the culmination of efforts by two local greyhound
adoption groups and a recreational pilot dedicated to saving the dogs
from possible suffering after their racing days are over. Linda

<HD>Firehouse Hostile to Woman, Jury Says</HD>
<DH>Trial: Ventura County firefighter wins $28,000--far short
of damages she sought--in sex discrimination case. Her supervisor is
cleared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON and HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Fire Department discriminated against a female
firefighter by subjecting her to a hostile work environment on the
basis of her gender, a jury ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But jurors awarded firefighter Anne Merino only a fraction of the
damages she had sought, a little more than $28,000, and cleared her
male supervisor of wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Standing outside the courtroom after the verdict was announced,
Merino looked stunned and upset.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad that they found the department responsible, but we are
disappointed with the amount," said attorney Lauren Bullock, who
represented the 37-year-old Long Beach resident in her discrimination
case.</TE>
<TE>   One of only 16 female firefighters in the 440-member department,
Merino sued her employer and supervisor, Capt. Damon Dalton, last
year for allegedly subjecting her to a hostile workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Merino alleged that Dalton did not want a woman on
his crew at Station 43 in Simi Valley and ostracized her on a daily
basis for about a year.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock argued in closing statements this week that Dalton gave
her client "the cold shoulder" and "froze her out" of station
activities. Bullock told jurors that the department did nothing to
correct the situation after it was brought to the attention of the
human resources department.</TE>
<TE>   But Oxnard attorney Alan Wisotsky argued that Dalton, despite his
discomfort in working in close quarters with a woman, tried to
include Merino in station activities and gave her a sterling review.</TE>
<TE>   "Merino was an involved member of the crew," said Wisotsky, who
represented Dalton and the Fire Department. "He didn't treat her any
differently."</TE>
<TE>   After a two-week civil trial in Ventura County Superior Court, a
majority of jurors agreed. They determined that Dalton, a 37-year-old
Thousand Oaks resident, did not discriminate against Merino.</TE>
<TE>   They found the department liable, however, for creating a hostile
work environment by not dealing with Merino's situation or properly
training its employees.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the department was aware of the problem and never really
addressed the issue," said juror Angel Rodriguez, a Ventura resident.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said the department needs to better educate its
employees about the importance of gender equality in the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Fire Chief Bob Roper said such steps are already
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Roper, who was called as a witness during the civil trial, said
Wednesday that fire officials recognized the need for additional
gender training four years ago when the department's long-term
strategic plan was drafted.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the jury," Roper said of his testimony, "that we want to
hire someone to come in and consult, and I'm going to have an
opportunity to do that soon."</TE>
<TE>   Roper will fly to Norfolk, Va., next month to attend a national
conference, at which he hopes to hire a diversity expert to prepare a
mandatory one-day training course for firefighters next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the department's 440 firefighters will be required to
view a 2 1/2-hour video next month on gender-discrimination laws. The
videos will be mailed to each station in the county, Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   Cadets at the county's fire training academy in Camarillo
currently receive about five hours of instruction, out of a total 13
weeks, on gender-discrimination laws.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the classwork, Roper said he is planning to form an
appeals committee, which will have the power to investigate employee
complaints on such matters.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's verdict, Wisotsky said the damages awarded by
the jury were substantially less than what the county had offered to
settle the case with Merino, who is currently on disability leave.</TE>
<TE>   Wisotsky declined to specify an amount, but said "it was a
substantial six-figure offer."</TE>

<HD>Staged Fights Added to Suit Against O.C. Sheriff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prisoners' rights lawyer alleged Wednesday that Orange County jail
guards have arranged fights between inmates for the guards'
entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Expanding a case filed recently against the Orange County
Sheriff's Department, lawyer Richard Herman said guards have opened
doors between groups of prisoners with opposing gang allegiances, in
expectations that they would brawl. The suit also alleges that guards
hold inmates in cells without mattresses and force them to stand
naked.</LD>
<LD>   The filing contained written statements by six inmates, one of
whom wrote that "guards staged and watched inmate fights."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Sheriff's Department said he could not comment
specifically on the claims because the department had not yet
received a copy of the suit. However, he did say that Orange County
jails were considered to be among the best run in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The contempt suit, filed in federal court in Santa Ana, says the
alleged activities violate a 1978 federal court order aimed at
stemming jail overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   Herman, who served as the plaintiff attorney as the jails came
under federal court review in the 1980s, contends that deputies are
routinely disregarding jail policy, resulting in abuses at the jail.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Slows Rate of Officer Attrition</HD>
<DH>Safety: Mayor Hahn credits new policies and an increase in
recruits. There is still a 1,100-person shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn released new figures on police
recruiting Wednesday, championing signs that the LAPD has begun to
stem the depletion of its ranks, in part because the Police Academy
in recent months has fielded consistently larger classes of recruits.</LD>
<LD>   But the Los Angeles Police Department still is losing more
officers than it is hiring, a trend that the mayor acknowledged will
take time to reverse. In the most recent fiscal year, which ended
last month, 449 officers left the department and 356 were hired.
Overall, the department had 8,910 police officers, but officials say
the force still is short of its budgeted number of officers by 1,100.</LD>
<LD>   The result is that the department continues to shrink, but at a
slower rate than in recent years.</LD>
<TE>   According to figures supplied by the mayor's office, the LAPD and
others, the recent progress is mainly the result of surging academy
activity. The number of recruits joining the academy in recent months
has averaged 50 per class. Last year, half of the classes were
canceled because not enough people were accepted to fill them.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a morning news conference at the LAPD's Hollywood
Division, Hahn pointed to what he said were a number of reasons for
the increase in recruits, including a new, more flexible work
schedule and a faster hiring process. In addition, the mayor said he
believes the prospect of new police leadership is aiding the search
for new recruits.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn opposed a second term for former Chief Bernard C. Parks, and
now the city is searching for a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a lot of years to shrink the department ... and it's
going to take a few years" to grow the LAPD, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   With recruits increasing and the number of departing officers down
slightly, the LAPD has seen a 26% reduction in attrition over the
last year. Some department observers attribute that decline to the
typical ebb and flow of retirements.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the number of officers who resigned after they completed
their probation was down 44%, from 229 to 129 over the last year.
Those officers typically leave for other law enforcement agencies,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has made an effort to seek out those officers, sending
600 letters to police who have left the LAPD for other agencies. Of
those, Hahn said, 62 have applied to return.</TE>
<TE>   The overall hiring numbers are encouraging for the department,
which had difficulty attracting officers in the late 1990s,
particularly when the job market was tightening. Although other law
enforcement agencies around the country experienced recruitment
problems, the LAPD's difficulties were considered severe.</TE>
<TE>   Some pointed to the length of time it took to be hired; others
said morale was low and that the Rampart corruption scandal affected
recruitment. Also, Parks' reputation as a strict disciplinarian
discouraged some potential recruits from joining, according to some
city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Hal Snow, assistant executive director of the California
Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, said other
California police departments continue to struggle to attract new
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Agencies are, across the board with very few exceptions, having
difficulty filling their vacancies," Snow said, adding that early
retirement packages aggravate the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective
League, said she believes the department is becoming more desirable
as it improves the hiring process and morale increases.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not losing candidates to other agencies the way we were
before," Grasso said.</TE>
<TE>   The city typically receives about 11,000 applications a year, but
only about 3% are selected, according to personnel officials.</TE>
<TE>   Most candidates fail to meet LAPD standards during the background
checks, these officials said. The department began using polygraph
tests within the last year, something other agencies have done for
years.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD and the city personnel department spent two days
reviewing the hiring process and looking for ways to expedite it. It
typically could take about 300 days before an applicant was hired;
now that has been cut to about 120 days, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "To be quite honest, it was really awful," said Maggie Whelan,
general manager of the personnel department. "We're looking at the
process every day."</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of police recruits are from Los Angeles and
surrounding communities.</TE>
<TE>   Among the newer officers is Tom Deckelman, a probationary officer
at the Hollywood station who said he was in a class of 19 in June
2001. He said the discussion of a flexible work schedule was a factor
in his decision to apply to the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Officers in some parts of the department now can choose between
working three 12-hour days a week or four 10-hour days a week. The
mayor, who was endorsed by the police union, made it a campaign
promise to implement the new schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn included money in the city budget for 360 new officers this
year, but he indicated that he will ask for more if recruitment
efforts continue to produce results.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make L.A. the safest big city in America," Hahn said.</TE>

<LD>It makes sense when you think about it. Lauren Schwartz of Moorpark
points out that a concert by Jack Mack &amp; the Heart Attack was
sponsored by Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center. I forgot to ask
if the audience received wrist tags at the gate.</LD>
<LD>   Which reminds me: Evelyn Hill of Malibu noticed that the
restaurant in the Santa Monica Medical Plaza parking structure is
named the Cutting Board.</LD>
<LD>   Enough to make anyone's heart beat faster: "Your sign, 'Road Ends
in Water,' would be of no practical value to the average SUV drivers
so preoccupied by their cell phones that they don't have the
inclination to read signs," writes Andy Lorenzen of Rancho Palos
Verdes.</LD>
<TE>   However, near the banks of the Loire River in France, he saw a
more graphic warning that might even grab the attention of an
American driver in an SUV (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the Pacific: While visiting Hawaii, Ed and Linda
Cook of Manhattan Beach spotted some unintentional humor in a story
about entertainer Bette Midler (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Just be careful not to stab yourself: Charlotte Fournier of Laguna
Woods found just the thing for those of you who want to give shampoos
to your little antlered creatures (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Well done, dude: The L.A. Independent's police log recounts how a
skateboarder rode an elevator to the top of a Culver City parking
structure, where a man demanded to know what he was doing there. The
skateboarder noticed other men who seemed to be trying to break into
cars. He fled and called police, who arrived in time to arrest a
suspect.</TE>
<TE>   And give me an idea for what will be my first hit TV series ...
I'm preparing my Emmy speech, now: The hero of my TV series is, yes,
a skateboarder, a restless kind of guy, a guy who is shunned by
narrow-minded adults, a guy who can't settle down with one gal, a guy
who roams from town to town and rescues people from trouble, then
skates off without even waiting for a thank-you.</TE>
<TE>   That's the premise, and I'm not changing anything just to get it
on the air. After all, I've got my self-respect. Maybe the
skateboarder could have a pet chimpanzee. And be psychic. I mean, the
chimpanzee could be psychic.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: One store chain has a "Dorm Room" display, full of
splashily decorated items such as bulletin boards, pillows and clocks
for the on-campus living quarters of the college genius in your
family.</TE>
<TE>   But the display omitted the most obvious item: ear plugs to drown
out the snoring of that annoying roommate.</TE>

<LD>A Kern County sheriff's deputy helped Pomona police catch a murder
suspect Wednesday after he read in an obituary that the man was to be
a pallbearer at a funeral.</LD>
<LD>   After staking out a Bakersfield cemetery, deputies and police
arrested Gustavo Gilbert Orsono, 24. Police say he shot and killed a
man with a sawed-off shotgun in Pomona in February 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Orsono, a member of a local gang, killed the former gang member
after the two had a fight in which the victim disparaged Orsono's
gang, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Kern County sheriff's deputies had been on the lookout for Orsono
when a deputy read that he would be at a funeral Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies and police officers went to the Green Lawn Southwest
Cemetery at 10 a.m. and took Orsono into custody without incident,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He was questioned in Kern County and then driven to Pomona for
booking into Los Angeles County Jail. He is being held on $2-million
bail.</TE>

<LD>A Tustin man was killed early Wednesday when his car rear-ended a
disabled vehicle on the Costa Mesa Freeway, authorities said. The two

<LD>   The 38-year-old man, whose name was not released pending
notification of relatives, died at the scene, said California Highway
Patrol Officer Colleen Richardson.</LD>
<LD>   The man was driving north on the freeway near Edinger Avenue when
his car rammed into the stranded Ford Mustang shortly before 2 a.m.,
Richardson said. Police said the man may not have seen the car in the
dark, although its emergency lights were blinking.</LD>
<TE>   The two men pushing the car to the side of the freeway saw the
oncoming car and ran before the collision, police said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Still fielding a barrage of questions over noxious fumes emanating
from an inadequate city pipeline, Oxnard officials have unveiled a
$51-million sewer project meant to expand current capacity and
satisfy future developments.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard residents won't need to worry about backed-up sewage waste
for the next 50 years once the new sewer is built, said Rob
Roshanian, the city's development services manager.</LD>
<LD>   The new system could accommodate developments now being planned,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   More than $30 million of the cost would come from developer fees.
The remaining $20.9 million could be funded with 30-year revenue
bonds to be repaid through user fees.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Share Grief for Samantha</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Throngs pack the Crystal Cathedral to mourn the
slain 5-year-old.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They began arriving Wednesday three hours early to remember a child
they felt they had come to know.</LD>
<LD>   They came from around the corner and from a hundred miles away,
interrupting commutes and vacations.</LD>
<LD>   All to pay tribute to a 5-year-old most had never met.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the picture. It was the picture," said Alex O'Campo over
and over as he clutched his 6-year-old daughter outside the Crystal
Cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   They were among an estimated 3,000 people who packed the giant
Garden Grove church for an evening memorial service for Samantha
Runnion, the Stanton girl who was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and
killed last week. Sheriff's officials estimated another 2,000 spilled
out the church doors and listened to the interdenominational service
over loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Your sympathy and love throughout have given my family tremendous
strength," Samantha's mother, Erin Runnion, said to a suddenly hushed
audience near the end of the hourlong nationally televised service.
"We always knew that she had a gift for the world. But it never
occurred to us that her greatness would be shared in her death."</TE>
<TE>   The service featured a video presentation on Samantha's life, two
children's choirs, a bagpiper and a mournful violin solo, "Edelweiss"
from "The Sound of Music," performed by a friend of the family.
Catholic, Buddhist, Jewish and Muslim clerics joined the memorial,
which was organized by the Crystal Cathedral and Westminster Memorial
Park, where Samantha is to be buried.</TE>
<TE>   "Samantha was all that was good in the world," said Orange County
Sheriff Michael Carona, who sat next to Samantha's mother during the
service and spoke during the memorial. "What happened to her was all
that was evil in the world."</TE>
<TE>   There were friends, family and neighbors of the Runnions from the
quiet condominium complex where she was abducted July 15. There were
law enforcement officers who frantically sought Samantha--and then
turned to hunt down her killer when her body was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Most in the crowd, though, were strangers, people of all ethnic
backgrounds and all ages, many with children in tow. People were
drawn to the cathedral on a hot summer's night for the simple reason
that they felt they had to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been to a funeral for somebody I didn't even know,"
said Greg Harris of Aliso Viejo. Before coming to the service he
drove past Samantha's condo complex--for reasons he can't entirely
explain.</TE>
<TE>   "It just happened," he said of his detour. "The fact that she did
everything right, did everything that she had to do and this terrible
thing still happened--that's what got to me.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so small, so tiny. Just a baby."</TE>
<TE>   Erin Runnion always warned her daughter to be careful of
strangers. But her attacker was brazen, cruising up to her and a
friend, asking for help finding a lost dog, then grabbing Samantha
and carrying the girl screaming and kicking back to his car.</TE>
<TE>   It took all of a minute.</TE>
<TE>   "This terrible thing traumatized the entire United States," said
Jaime Hernandez, 52, of Westminster, who brought his 13-year-old
daughter and 11-year-old son to Wednesday's service.</TE>
<TE>   Like others in the crowd, Hernandez said Samantha's death has been
a wake-up call for parents. "How could your heart not feel the pain
when you saw the mother pleading on television that she be returned
alive?" Hernandez said. "My wife and I began crying when we saw that.
We looked at each other. We were both thinking the same thing: That
very well could have been one of [our] children."</TE>
<TE>   High above the cathedral, a skywriting plane drew a heart, a cross
and the letters "SR." Inside, Samantha lay in a small wooden casket
topped with pink flowers. Pink flowers formed a broken heart on the
stage. Pictures of her smiling face filled large-screen televisions.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the printed program for the service was a picture that
Samantha, who would have turned 6 last Friday, had drawn of an
animal, a house and a woman with long hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my family more than anybody in the hole wold," she wrote.
"More then enyboody in the hole wold."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the crowd echoed the words of speakers who said that
Samantha had become part of everyone's family.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt obligated to come today," said O'Campo, 32, who had
driven down from Oxnard. "I'm on vacation. But we felt that instead
of going to Universal Studios, it was better to come to Samantha's
service."</TE>
<TE>   Marisa Williams, 31, and two friends arrived in Southern
California a few days ago on vacation from Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   They've already been to Universal Studios and did the tour of
Hollywood stars' homes.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday they found themselves at Samantha's service.</TE>
<TE>   "She was everybody's little girl during those horrible days last
week," said Williams, who watched the story unfold on television.
"You don't have to have a daughter or even be a parent in order to be
grief-stricken about what happened to Samantha."</TE>
<TE>   Rosalie Lingle, 52, has a family--a big one. She drove from Moreno
Valley with her daughter and two of her eight granddaughters to
support the Runnions and to find closure for herself.</TE>
<TE>   Lingle followed last week's news in every heartbreaking detail. In
the course of five days, Samantha became a part of her life.</TE>
<TE>   And a part of her family too.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a grandchild who is also named Samantha, who is also 5
years old, whose birthday is this week and she also has brown curly
hair," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Samantha became my granddaughter. She's our angel too."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Mike Anton and David Haldane contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Opponents Spar Over Secession Ballot Language</HD>
<DH>Breakup: LAFCO seeks to include explanation that alimony
wouldn't represent new costs for taxpayers. Both sides threaten legal
action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state panel Wednesday sought to head off a last-minute court battle
over the way the costs of San Fernando Valley and Hollywood cityhood
will be presented to voters.</LD>
<LD>   A committee of the Local Agency Formation Commission proposed
compromise ballot language for separation payments the Valley and
Hollywood would have to make to Los Angeles if the areas secede. The
language would inform voters of the annual payments but explain that
the amounts would not represent new costs to taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   "It clarifies the language and provides the voters with a better
understanding," LAFCO member Carol Herrera said of the proposed
ballot text. "The earlier language only told part of the story and
gave a skewed impression that perhaps would raise some alarm bells."</LD>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is scheduled today to formally place the
Valley secession measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. Because of a recent
change in state law, LAFCO has the final say on placing the Hollywood
measure on the ballot, and is set to do so Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents, led by Mayor James K. Hahn and the City
Council, have insisted that the ballot language include the so-called
alimony payments that a Valley or Hollywood city would make for 20
years. But breakup advocates say inserting such language without a
fuller explanation would mislead and frighten voters.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides say they might take legal action if the final ballot
language is not to their liking.</TE>
<TE>   The payments would compensate Los Angeles for the loss of tax
revenue from the Valley and Hollywood, and represent the amount of
taxes the two areas pay in excess of the value of city services they
receive.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley payment would be $127.1 million the first year and
decline by 5% annually. Hollywood's payment would start at $21.4
million; it also would drop each year.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials have highlighted the payments in attacking
secession, claiming the new cities would not be able to afford them.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists, however, note that LAFCO accounted for the
payments before determining that Valley and Hollywood cities would be
financially fit.</TE>
<TE>   They also say the payments are proof the two areas are
shortchanged by City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The county supervisors seemed split Wednesday on LAFCO's proposed
ballot language.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke have
introduced a motion calling for the payment information to appear on
the ballot in the form suggested by the mayor and council.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who is also a LAFCO member, said he
preferred to exclude the information entirely because state law is
unclear about whether it is required. But he said he would support
LAFCO's language.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a cost," Yaroslavsky said of the payments. "This is
an over-realization of revenues. It's a political issue that has been
polled on by the opposition."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Michael Antonovich said he also would back language
that described the payments as the amount of excess taxes now paid by
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth board member, Don Knabe, is undecided.</TE>
<TE>   The LAFCO language would be inserted after the $127.1-million
figure is cited in the Valley measure. It would describe the annual
payments as "payments the Local Agency Formation Commission has
determined represent the difference between the revenue collected in
the San Fernando Valley area by the city of Los Angeles in fiscal
year 2000-2001 over and above the amount expended by the city of Los
Angeles in providing services to the San Fernando Valley area in that
year."</TE>
<TE>   The same text, tailored to Hollywood, would be inserted in the
measure LAFCO is set to place on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski and other Los Angeles
officials were skeptical. She said the LAFCO wording could unfairly
help the secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said the language proposed by the council is "nothing
but full disclosure, fully informing the public about what this is
all about."</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), the only declared
candidate for mayor for a Valley city, denounced the council and Hahn
as "downtown power mongers using desperate tactics" to confuse voters
about secession's costs.</TE>
<TE>   Richman held a news conference Wednesday at the Northridge
Recreation Center, where a city-owned swimming pool has been closed
for two summers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here because of unpaved Valley streets, inadequate police
deployment, wasteful city spending and unaccountable bureaucrats who
neglect their most fundamental duties to provide city services,"
Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, secession backers peppered Hahn with pointed questions
during a call-in show on radio station KFWB-AM (980).</TE>
<TE>   They asked why the city has lost all of its Fortune 500 companies,
why it charges higher taxes than neighboring cities, and why it
spends less on senior services, as a percentage of the total budget,
than Burbank and Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said L.A. provides senior services unavailable in many
smaller cities, has embarked on a program to reduce business taxes
and has lost its remaining Fortune 500 companies in corporate
mergers, not business flight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like people are fleeing Los Angeles," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn's anti-secession campaign picked up the support
Wednesday of nearly 50 civic, faith-based and nonprofit leaders and
organizations. They announced the formation of the Civic Coalition
for a United Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Among its members are the American Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the NAACP, the
League of Women Voters and the Latin American Civic Assn.</TE>

<HD>Woman Held in Sequoia Blaze</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Her runaway campfire is suspected of igniting an
inferno that threatens several groves of giant trees. At least 10
buildings are destroyed, 1,000 people evacuated.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KERNVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Forest Service on Wednesday arrested a Bakersfield woman
whose campfire is blamed for igniting a 55,000-acre blaze that
continues to burn out of control, threatening a number of groves of
towering trees in Sequoia National Forest. As night fell, the blaze
had destroyed at least 10 buildings and forced the evacuation of
1,000 residents and campers.</LD>
<LD>   Driven by erratic winds that gusted through the rugged,
mountainous terrain, the flames spread rapidly through the recently
established Sequoia National Monument south of the better-known
national park of the same name. Although the fire was not threatening
the park late Wednesday, it was expanding in three directions: east,
southeast and west, according to the Forest Service.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like an amoeba," said Art Gaffrey, supervisor of the
National Monument, a 328,000-acre enclave within the forest dedicated
two years ago by President Clinton for the preservation of the
stately trees.</LD>
<TE>   Gaffrey said 11 groves of sequoias, many of them 2,000 years old,
were within a mile or two of the advancing flames. He said if the
winds pick up or change direction, "the fire has every opportunity to
enter a grove." The fire was 16% contained as of 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Teri VanBrunt, 45, was arrested at her home in Bakersfield by
Forest Service law enforcement personnel and county sheriff's
deputies.Yvonne Young, a Forest Service spokeswoman, said VanBrunt
was being held in Kern County jail on suspicion of allowing a
campfire to escape. She is scheduled for a court appearance today in
Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service said VanBrunt reportedly had walked into the
Roads End Lodge near this small mountain town Sunday afternoon and
told people her abandoned campfire was burning out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Adams, another Forest Service spokesman, said she walked
away and that a few minutes later, the lodge burned to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Clouds of brown smoke mushroomed thousands of feet into the air
Wednesday afternoon as the flames consumed stands of chaparral,
cedars and pine trees. Six elite hotshot ground crews were brought in
to supplement the more than 1,000 firefighters on the ground and 18
water-dropping aircraft in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Most immediately threatened Wednesday night were the Pack Saddle,
Long Meadow, Cunningham, Three Sisters and Freeman Creek groves
scattered along a 10-mile stretch of steep canyons and tall mountain
ridges on the west flank of the Kern River.</TE>
<TE>   "Protection of the giant sequoias is one of the main objectives,"
Gaffrey said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 feet around in some cases, ancient sequoias are more
massive than California's coastal redwoods, which grow taller.</TE>
<TE>   With their thick bark, the giant sequoias are among the most
fire-resistant conifers in the world, but they are not invulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Exline, a Forest Service public information officer, said that
burn scars left over the centuries show that the massive trunks of
the trees can survive repeated fires, but if foliage on the upper
limbs burns, the trees could die.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, fires of high intensity can heat the earth sufficiently
to kill the trees by burning their shallow roots, said Jon Keeley, a
research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey based in Sequoia
National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exline said crews have been clearing away underbrush in recent
years to reduce the chance that flare-ups will spread to the green
canopies, 100 to 200 feet above the forest floor.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, she said, brush hasn't yet been cleared away in any
of the groves most immediately threatened by the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the trees withstood fires that tended to be more
frequent but of comparatively low intensity. Such fires, in fact, can
aid in the growth of giant sequoias by helping clear out the forest
floor and providing places where seedlings can germinate.</TE>
<TE>   But some fires in recent times have been more intense and have
lasted longer, and experts such as Keeley worry that the giant trees
may not be able to survive these fires.</TE>
<TE>   The reason these fires are more intense is the subject of fierce
debate among loggers, who blame environmentalists for filing suits
that prevent thinning the forests of smaller, fire-prone trees and
brush, and environmental groups, who argue that logging companies
target the biggest, most fire-resistant trees in the forest.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service, which determines which trees can be cut, tries
to walk a middle ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think the timber companies or the environmentalists are
all right or all wrong," said Matt Mathes, the chief spokesman for
the Forest Service in California. "The point is there is too much
fuel out there for a whole set of reasons,"--not the least of which,
he said, is that the Forest Service has suppressed 97% of all fires,
thus preventing the beneficial effects of low-intensity fires.</TE>
<TE>   According to Keeley, both fire suppression and logging practices
can promote the dense regrowth of underbrush and small trees that
create the conditions for more devastating fires.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to think of these abnormally dense forests being the
result of fire suppression. But sometimes cutting does the same
thing, and results in lots of little trees," Keeley said.</TE>
<TE>   At nightfall Wednesday, the fire in the Sequoia forest was still
more than 20 miles from the better-known Sequoia National Park and
more than 30 miles from the park's Giant Forest area, home to
2,500-year-old General Sherman, said to be the largest tree in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Officials offered reassurances Wednesday that the national park is
open and operating normally, with no restrictions on any of the park
operations, attractions or guest services, but officials said that
despite its distance, the blaze was scaring away some vtors.</TE>
<TE>   "Guests are calling with concerns about the fire, and some are
canceling their reservations," said Katherine Boyer, a spokeswoman
for the Wuksachi Lodge, the deluxe, 102-room hotel in the Giant
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just no way the fire could spread this far," Boyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of the wildfire's leapfrogging path was visible Wednesday
along the steep, twisting two-lane road between Roads End and the
advancing fire lines near Ponderosa, about a dozen miles to the
north.</TE>
<TE>   The Roads End Lodge was burned to the ground, with little left but
the soot-stained fireplace chimney and a few scattered sheets of tin
from the roof. A few miles up the road, a bed-and-breakfast complex
was unscathed, with bright American flags on the side of the
building.</TE>
<TE>   In some areas, every bit of brush and timber had burned. In
others, the chaparral and trees were untouched.</TE>

<HD>$51-Million Sewer Line Proposed for Oxnard</HD>
<DH>Services: Officials say the new system would accommodate
future developments and take care of residents' worries about sewage
backup for the next 50 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still fielding a barrage of questions over noxious fumes emanating
from an inadequate city pipeline, Oxnard officials have unveiled a
$51-million sewer project meant to expand current capacity and
satisfy future developments.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard residents won't need to worry about backed-up sewage waste
for the next 50 years once the new sewer is built, said Rob
Roshanian, the city's development services manager.</LD>
<LD>   The project, unveiled at a council meeting Tuesday evening, would
add a new sewer line from the north end of the city to Oxnard's
wastewater treatment facility in the south end by mid-2006.</LD>
<TE>   The new system could accommodate developments now being planned,
including the mammoth mixed-use RiverPark project, said Mark Norris,
Oxnard's wastewater superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   The new main sewer line would cost $51 million, of which $30.1
million would come from developer fees. The remaining $20.9 million
could be funded with 30-year revenue bonds to be repaid through user
fees.</TE>
<TE>   The new system would be constructed in three phases, with the
first phase beginning by next summer and the final phase ending in
2006.</TE>
<TE>   At completion, the project would have sewer capacity for several
developments expected to bring more than 4,900 residential units to
town by 2007, including Northwest Community, Northshore Community,
College Park, Sea Bridge at Mandalay Bay and West Port at Mandalay
Bay, Roshanian said.</TE>
<TE>   If a sewer system is eventually built for El Rio, it would also
connect to the new sewer line.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said a new sewer line has been planned for several years
and is just one of the improvements the city must make to its
wastewater collection, treatment plant and storm water systems at an
estimated cost of $305 million by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   "The city is in pretty fair shape from a capacity standpoint," and
the line is meant to fulfill future needs, Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted to have its staff begin exploring funding
options for the sewer line.</TE>
<TE>   Discussion of the project came after two weeks of intense pressure
from residents of the South Bank area, in north Oxnard south of the
Santa Clara River, who appealed to county and city officials to
investigate a rotten odor that they said had nauseated them for
years.</TE>
<TE>   The bad smell was traced to a pipe carrying partially treated
waste from the Ventura Regional Sanitation District's Liquid Waste
Treatment Facility in Montalvo to Oxnard's sewage system.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard officials deny their city's system was faulty.</TE>
<TE>   Because sewer pipes in north Oxnard serve mostly residences, they
are too small to also handle the extra waste from the Liquid Waste
Treatment Facility, which was forced to move its waste at night when
household use was at a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, smelly liquid waste sat all day inside the pipeline,
producing gases such as hydrogen sulfide, which can cause eye
irritation, sore throats and coughing, shortness of breath,
headaches, memory loss, or even death under extremely high levels of
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   For residents, the result was a big stink as well as possible
health risks, they said. Some said they would wake up to smells
comparable to burning garbage or raw feces.</TE>
<TE>   "I had severe headaches, bronchitis and sinus problems," said
resident Roberta Childress, a retired legal secretary who fought to
have the pipe closed. "I started getting bloody noses and that
worried me." The odor was inescapable, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a severe smell, a rotten egg smell inside our home. It
would get worse at night."</TE>
<TE>   The county-run sanitation district stopped operations from the
Liquid Waste Treatment Facility earlier this month after numerous
complaints. Since then, residents said the smell from the sewage line
has subsided.</TE>
<TE>   South Bank residents doubt the city's new sewer plan will be
adequate, homeowner Bert Perello said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bill Smith, general manager of the sanitation district,
said the agency is scouting for a new site for treating liquid
wastes.</TE>
<TE>   Any area in Ventura County could work, he said. However, an area
with few home developments would probably be best.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to be offensive to anyone," Smith said.</TE>

<HD>Simon Tries to Change Subject</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Candidate's talk of charity and urban renewal is
met with more questions on finances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Bill Simon Jr. sought to shift the focus of the governor's race away
from his personal finances Wednesday as Gov. Gray Davis released a
new television ad saying his Republican challenger had "siphoned"
money from a charitable foundation.</LD>
<LD>   At campaign stops in San Diego and Hollywood, Simon tried to
highlight his charitable donations and urban renewal plans. But he
also faced questions for the first time on the stacks of tax returns
that he let reporters peruse at a special viewing Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's quite clear now to everybody--contrary to what Gray Davis
said--that I've paid a lot of taxes," Simon said.</LD>
<TE>   Simon, an investment banker who inherited millions of dollars from
his father, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, reported
income of $36 million from 1990 to 2000. He paid roughly a third of
that in state and federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the tax returns, which reporters were not allowed to
photocopy, reported at least $13 million in investment losses from
1998 to 2000, Simon said they still reflected his solid track record
as an investment banker.</TE>
<TE>   "I made good money in the 1990s, so I am a successful
businessman," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic governor continued to challenge that assertion.
Davis' latest television ad--his fourth attacking Simon--says the
Republican nominee "inherited a fortune, but on his own, he's had
losses, bankruptcies, lawsuits and even allegations of fraud."</TE>
<TE>   The ad also says Simon "siphoned excessive fees from his father's
charitable foundation" and cannot be trusted to run a charity, much
less California. It cites a San Francisco Chronicle report that
Simon's private investment firm charged unusually high commissions to
manage the assets of the William E. Simon Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis released the spot on the same day his GOP rival sought to
spotlight his record as a charity leader with a visit to the William
E. Simon Jr. Center, named after the candidate, at Covenant House, a
shelter for runaways in Hollywood. Simon, a former Covenant House
California board chairman, said he hadn't seen the new ad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it will be just as false as all the other ads that he's
run, which have been false from the first sentence to the last
sentence," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   His campaign later released a statement saying it was sad that
Davis had "chosen to attack charities." It said Simon family
foundations had given more than $50 million to charity, but the
statement did not respond to the charge of excessive management fees.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has also tried to broaden his base by--among other
things--casting himself as a bigger champion of the environment than
Davis. But on a KRLA-AM radio show Wednesday morning, Simon
criticized Davis for signing legislation that makes California the
first state to fight global warming by requiring a cut in tailpipe
emissions of greenhouse gases. He said Davis "wants to get
Californians out of their cars."</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, Gov. Davis believes in social engineering,"
Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Simon accused Davis of neglecting the housing needs
in crowded areas of California cities, where he said many low-income
families can't afford to live.</TE>
<TE>   "Why has Gray Davis ignored the plight of our cities?" Simon
asked. "Perhaps it's because the residents of these communities can't
hire lobbyists, and they can't attend $10,000 fund-raisers."</TE>
<TE>   Simon tried to deflect questions on his taxes by saying there was
no time to "focus on things that are not on the people's minds."</TE>

<HD>Issue Is Loud and Clear for a Key Bloc of Voters</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A portly, elderly man wearing a Hawaii baseball cap and a hearing aid
the size of an oyster shell lowered himself onto the folding chair
next to Anne Cohen.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you see the editorial in the Daily News today?" he asked,
somewhat loudly. "It was tremendous. The City Hall people, they're
trying every obstructionist thing they can to prevent the new city.
Me, I want to get out of L.A."</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, a small woman of 82, retired bookkeeper and office manager
who lives in Sherman Oaks, looked the stranger up and down. "Why
break up everything we've built up over all these years?" she asked.
"I'm totally against breaking up a wonderful city like this."</LD>
<TE>   "Wonderful city?" the man exclaimed. "You go anywhere in the
Valley and look at all the potholes that never get fixed." He waved a
hand dismissively. "Don't talk to me. I don't want to get angry." He
stewed for a moment. "And she calls it a 'wonderful city,' " he
muttered. "I better go sit someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   He rose and sidled past the feet of others, en route to friendlier
precincts half a dozen rows farther back in the auditorium. Cohen
rested her hands on the purse in her lap and lifted her chin.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the anticipated audience of 100 was doubling. More and
more chairs were unfolded and lined up on the bare wooden floor of
the Sherman Oaks-Van Nuys Center to accommodate the Seniors for
Action public debate on San Fernando Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   The battle already has spawned citizens meetings in halls and
living rooms throughout Los Angeles, as pro- and anti-secessionists
test their arguments and measure public sentiment about breaking Los
Angeles into smaller pieces. It no doubt will birth many more as the
Nov. 5 election nears.</TE>
<TE>   Although radio and television ads are sure to begin proliferating
as the two sides raise money to buy air time, turnout for local
elections is always low, and small gatherings of
more-interested-than-average citizens like the Seniors for Action
likely will prove to be an important part of turning sentiment into
votes.</TE>
<TE>   At the debate, the heads dipping over the fact sheets were
grandparently white. The seats filled in an orderly way from front to
back (the attendees wanted to make sure they could hear). Fliers on a
lobby table offered "Memory Testing ... FREE." Nonetheless, this was
a tough house--an audience plenty wise to the world, with a lot of
time for argument and little patience for folderol.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE (Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment), the highest-profile pro-secession group, had barely
begun his remarks when a man in the audience shouted, "Louder!"</TE>
<TE>   "Louder?" Brain asked.</TE>
<TE>   He resumed his statement at higher volume.</TE>
<TE>   "Speak a little slower," yelled another man.</TE>
<TE>   "Slower," Brain confirmed</TE>
<TE>   Brain's opponent, political consultant Larry Levine, leader of the
Valley-based anti-secession group One Los Angeles, began by
apologizing for not having brought enough handouts. "They're bringing
more material," he said, "When it gets here ..."</TE>
<TE>   "Can't hear you!" a woman shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Levine moved the hand microphone closer to his mouth. "When it
gets here--is that better?"</TE>
<TE>   "You weren't prepared," a man shouted.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear from the start that, like Anne Cohen and the man in
the Hawaii hat, sizable segments of the audience had made up their
minds about secession."I'd like to ask the people down here," Levine
scolded, pointing to the front left of the hall, "to let me finish my
speech without heckling and without commenting. The people on the
other side were courteous enough to let Jeff finish without
commenting and making smart-aleck remarks."</TE>
<TE>   Anne Cohen shifted indignantly in her seat. "This crowd here,
these older people," she muttered, "they're all crude. The people I
know are more intelligent. They're dead-set against secession."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of what might happen to the L.A. rent-control ordinance
if a Valley city were formed proved of keen interest to an audience
of fixed-incomers. Brain castigated secession opponents for raising
the specter of the law being lifted by a new Valley city council. A
"scare tactic," he called it. He then bade several announced Valley
city council candidates in attendance to stand and state their
position on the issue. Each pledged support for eternal rent control.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue was never discussed by anybody on our side," he
asserted. "This has been brought up by the opposition to instill fear
... and I, as president of Valley VOTE, will do everything in my
power with our organization to ensure that your rent control stays in
place. Because I'm a renter too."</TE>
<TE>   "In Glendale!" two men in the audience shouted simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   This contention, a familiar one, that he doesn't even live in the
part of the Valley that might secede from L.A., but in the
free-standing city of Glendale, rumpled Brain's usually smooth and
earnest demeanor. "No, not true," he insisted. "I lived in Sherman
Oaks for 25 years and I left because I got a divorce, and now I've
moved back to Sherman Oaks."</TE>
<TE>   The $1.3 billion that a Valley city would have to pay in alimony
to L.A. over 20 years was shocking to Levine. Brain said the
prosperous new city readily would manage it.</TE>
<TE>   An elderly woman rose to be recognized. "It seems like all the
advantages that would come to us senior citizens would come 20 years
from now," she said to Brain. "And we're not going to be around
then."</TE>
<TE>   "What about your children and grandchildren?" countered a man
sitting a few rows away.</TE>
<TE>   This set off a succession of love-bombs, as the debaters hastened
to proclaim their intense devotion to the well-being of the elderly
("I love senior citizens," asserted Brain. "I love seniors too," said
Levine, when it was his turn to speak.)</TE>
<TE>   Anne Cohen rose and was recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "Recently, they had a very interesting article in the L.A. Times
about L.A. patterning itself after New York City, which is the
biggest, the most wonderful city in the United States ... "--here
there was bipartisan applause--"and I would like to hear from both of
you how you feel about having a borough system here in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Brain said city officials' refusal to place a borough proposal on
the November ballot proves their determination not to surrender an
iota of power. Levine thought the boroughs idea "intriguing," but
premature.</TE>
<TE>   It was time for final summations. Brain waxed fervent about the
years of oppression and humiliation that Valley residents have
endured at the hands of snobs and decision-makers on the other side
of the Santa Monicas. "Mayor Hahn called us 'harebrained,' " he said.
"Recently, we were told by Larry Levine that we were acting like
petulant children. I don't think that's the kind of talk that keeps
people part of the city." Levine called L.A. "a mighty giant whose
fame is known the world over." He declared: "It's time to stop
bad-mouthing Los Angeles. It's time to stop trashing Los Angeles,
trying to break up Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The debate was over. Anne Cohen gathered her things, marveling,
"Can you imagine London breaking up? Paris breaking up? All the great
cities of the world breaking up?" She shook her head at the very
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, at least I got to ask my question," she said. She rose and
left the hall, chatting with another woman as she went, her purse and
her vote securely in hand.</TE>

<HD>Simi Strike Is Put on Hold Pending Vote</HD>
<DH>Labor: The City Council this morning is expected to
consider the proposed pay and benefits agreement for 300 employees
after a compromise is reached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND and HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An 11th-hour compromise between Simi Valley officials and union
workers has temporarily averted a strike that was set to begin this
morning. City Council members are scheduled to meet behind closed
doors at 10 a.m. today to vote on a proposed contract offer, which
would give workers a 19.6% increase in salary and benefits over four
years.</LD>
<LD>   "If the city approves it, the strike is off, and if they don't
approve it, we'll go on strike at noon," Edgar McLemore, president of
the union's bargaining unit, said Wednesday evening, adding that he
was optimistic but was taking a wait-and-see approach. "The Grim
Reaper's still out there."</LD>
<LD>   "We think it's a good package and it helps the union reach their
goals," Assistant City Manager Laura Magelnicki said.</LD>
<TE>   Service Employees International Union Local 988 covers about 300
police dispatchers, clerks, bus drivers, custodians, mechanics and
secretaries in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement, reached after about four hours of
last-ditch talks Wednesday, followed a breakdown in negotiations late
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   At issue was a clause to require the union to essentially waive
review of an unfinished salary and compensation study the city
commissioned in April.</TE>
<TE>   The waiver would have been in exchange for city leaders agreeing
to increase their offer from 16% in salary and benefits to 19.6%,
City Manager Mike Sedell said. Union negotiators had been asking all
along for a pay and benefits package totaling 21.6% through 2006.</TE>
<TE>   But union leaders refused to sign away the right to see the study,
which will compare in detail the wages and benefits of Simi Valley
municipal employees with those in other cities. Union officials
believe that report will show how far behind the workers are among
their peers.</TE>
<TE>   While the study would not mean automatic pay increases, the
results could put political pressure on the city for future raises.
"We're not willing to give that up," McLemore said.</TE>
<TE>   Sedell said the study issue was more of a misunderstanding than
anything else, which is why he agreed to recommend to the City
Council today that the 19.6% offer stand without the waiver clause.</TE>
<TE>   "We're there conceptually, we're there economically, now we just
have to figure out a way to get there politically," Sedell said.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore said if the council approves the contract, mail-in
ballots will be sent to all union members Friday. The contract is
subject to approval by a majority of the union's 170 dues-paying
members who vote on the pact.</TE>
<TE>   The deal includes a pay hike of about 3% each year with the
remainder of the money earmarked for benefits. The offer also allows
for creation of a medical benefits program for union retirees.</TE>
<TE>   The contract equates to about $7 million in extra payroll costs
over the four years, McLemore said.</TE>
<TE>   The average union member earns about $16 an hour. Under the
proposed increase, an average worker would earn about $16.50.</TE>
<TE>   Union members have been working without a contract since June 30,
when the last four-year pact expired.</TE>
<TE>   The bargaining unit's desire for full coverage of workers' medical
benefits had been the main sticking point in the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders argue the city's contributions to their health
benefits--about $310 a month--are less than half the $810 that
management employees receive.</TE>
<TE>   The city is now offering to contribute about $550 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Some union members say they have to pay $300 monthly for HMO
insurance, and many worry that as premiums rise they won't be able to
afford insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity has accrued over time as workers' contracts failed
to keep pace with rising medical insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   The city's management employees, who are not represented by a
union, receive pay increases that are negotiated annually.</TE>
<TE>   If the contract is rejected and workers strike, city leaders said
they are prepared to ensure that essential city services continue.</TE>
<TE>   Sedell said the public would most likely be affected by a loss of
bus service.</TE>
<TE>   He said that despite union accusations, he has not told employees
whether they should strike.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / EL MONTE</KH>
<HD>Replica Statue Is Gift That Keeps on Giving</HD>
<DH>Scaled-down Lady Liberty, donated by an immigrant from
Taiwan, has attained near-landmark status in front of City Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many names for the woman who stands watch along a busy
street in El Monte with one arm outstretched toward the sun.</LD>
<LD>   To the people of El Monte, she is "Lady Liberty."</LD>
<LD>   Or "Mother of Exiles," as poet Emma Lazarus once labeled her
more-famous New York cousin.</LD>
<TE>   Or something more akin to a plastic lawn flamingo, as one
dissenter suggested when the 23-foot, one-ton statue was installed in
El Monte in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the fiberglass replica of the Statue of Liberty has
become a beacon of sorts for this community in which more than half
of the 116,000 residents are foreign-born, according to census
estimates, and only one in five residents speaks English at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of an interesting, almost-landmark in El Monte," said
Assistant City Manager Juan Mireles. "A lot of people, even on
weekends, will stop by and take photographs of themselves with the
statue."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, where amusement parks boast scaled-down
versions of everything from the Matterhorn to the Golden Gate Bridge,
El Monte's faux Statue of Liberty might seem like one more example of
local kitsch--an incongruous sight on Valley Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Yet El Monte's statue possesses a certain magnetism and draws
people not so much with its grandeur, but by the idea it represents.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after Sept. 11, area residents left flowers, wreaths
and candles at the statue's base as a tribute to those who died in
the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Other people, they know the Statue of Liberty in El Monte," said
Dr. Jiiang T. Wang, a physician and Taiwanese immigrant who donated
the statue to the city in 1986. He had obtained the statue from
friends in Taiwan in exchange for forgiving a $50,000 debt.</TE>
<TE>   Right away, he said, he knew that he wanted to donate it to a
city--preferably one near a freeway--"so that people could see it
when they drove by."</TE>
<TE>   Wang, a resident of Sierra Madre, was considering giving Liberty
to the nearby city of Duarte. But then Grace Black, who worked as
executive secretary for the El Monte City Council, spotted the statue
behind a vacant building, where Wang had been storing it.</TE>
<TE>   She approached Wang, who has run the Duke Medical Clinic in El
Monte for 29 years, and asked if he would consider lending the statue
to El Monte for its Fourth of July celebration. That event, held at
Arroyo High School, coincided with the centennial of the original
Statue of Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Wang instead offered to donate the statue to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so excited. She got back to me and the city agreed to
accept my donation," Wang said. "On July 4, I donated the statue to
the city. That's the story."</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't the end of it.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertain Future</TE>
<TE>   After that Independence Day celebration in 1986, the statue
collected dust in a public works yard for more than a year as the
city debated what to do with it. The high school declined it, worried
that a two-story statue would be a target for vandalism. Judges at
the El Monte courthouse turned it down, in part because it clashed
with the building's modern architecture.</TE>
<TE>   When word of the statue's uncertain future spread, Wang received
calls from as far away as Montana offering it a home.</TE>
<TE>   That got El Monte officials moving. They gave Liberty a tryout in
front of City Hall and across the street from the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Lady Liberty was an instant hit.</TE>
<TE>   When the council voted a month later to approve the site as a
permanent home for the statue, only one councilman--the source of the
pink flamingo analogy--voted against it. More than 250 people,
including representatives from El Monte's sister cities in Mexico and
France, attended the dedication ceremony in November 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, El Monte has continued to embrace Wang's gift. A
pixilated image of the statue adorns the city's Web site, and every
City Council agenda features a black-and-white picture of the
original Statue of Liberty in the upper left corner.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not expect it to become almost a landmark for the city,"
Wang said.</TE>
<TE>   And while it may not be a bona fide monument, the statue is given
landmark treatment. The El Monte Public Works Department installed a
3-foot, cement-and-steel base for Liberty, with a bronze plaque that
reads: "Donated to the city of El Monte for the enjoyment of all its
citizens." Lights around its perimeter illuminate the statue at
night.</TE>
<TE>   "We do wash the statue, I would say every six months, using an
aerial lift--a cherry picker--with brushes and water," said Joe
Espinosa, head of the Public Works Department. "We give it a good
bath. We haven't painted it in a few years. We are trying to make it
look authentic. The longer you let it go, the more natural the
color."</TE>
<TE>   When the statue arrived from Taiwan, its bare fiberglass was
white. City officials, determined to make it look more like the
original, decided to paint it green. But instead of a dusty,
weathered color, Liberty ended up bright mint green. The color was
subsequently toned down.</TE>
<TE>   Evolving Green</TE>
<TE>   But what shade of green is the statue these days, exactly?</TE>
<TE>   "It's the color of copper oxidized," said Clarke Moseley, El Monte
city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a teal," said Espinosa, the person who should know. "We try
to match it up as close as we can. With the weathering, you are never
going to match the same color."</TE>
<TE>   "People pretty much respect" the statue, Espinosa added. "Nobody
has ever [defiled] it. People see the statue and want to touch it and
gather round it or look at it."</TE>
<TE>   There was one bizarre incident in 1991, even if the motivation
was, in a way, patriotic. A Baldwin Park man, frustrated at not being
allowed to serve in the Persian Gulf War because he was an immigrant,
tried to commit suicide in front of the statue. He was unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Wang, for his part, says he is happy with the way El Monte has
acted as caretaker for his statue and how it has become an integral
part of civic life.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel comfortable now, very comfortable now," he said. "I feel
it's in the right city."</TE>

<HD>Property Tax Hike Proposed</HD>
<DH>Finances: L.A. County supervisor's plan would raise $175
million for the fraying emergency health-care network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors will ask voters to approve a
$175-million parcel tax to shore up the county's fraying network of
emergency rooms and trauma centers, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   They are scheduled next week to begin the process of placing the
initiative on the November ballot. Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky
unveiled his proposal for the tax increase, and a majority of his
colleagues said through aides that they support the idea.</LD>
<LD>   The tax would also provide money for bioterrorism preparedness.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal would cost property owners 3 cents per square foot
per month, or $46.22 annually for a 1,500-square-foot house. To pass,
the measure must receive two-thirds of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   In his proposal, Yaroslavsky says $92 million a year is needed to
preserve the county's public emergency rooms that are threatened with
closure. It also calls for spending $63 million to aid the trauma
network of public and private hospitals that treat victims of severe
injuries, and $20 million to combat bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The trauma and emergency services medical network of this county
is in danger of collapse if something isn't done," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kris Vosburgh of the anti-tax Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.
said the measure was ill-conceived. "The reason the county has less
money is because the people have less money," he said. "This is not
the time to raise taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Because of declining federal funding, the county faces an
$800-million deficit in its health department in three years. Earlier
this month the supervisors voted to make the deepest cuts ever to
their medical system, cutting $150 million from the budget to close
11 clinics and High Desert Hospital and eliminating 5,000 jobs. The
cuts are being appealed by county unions and health advocates.</TE>
<TE>   If the county does not get more money from Washington, the health
department has proposed closing two far larger hospitals in October:
Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar and Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center near Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Shutting those hospitals' emergency rooms could wreck the county's
emergency and trauma network by swamping financially strapped private
hospitals with uninsured patients, health experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky has long spoken about the possibility of pushing a
ballot initiative to fund the trauma system, as have county unions.
In recent days he has discussed his proposal with his fellow
supervisors, who have indicated support.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina backs the measure, according to her
spokesman, Miguel Santana. "This is something that impacts every
resident, regardless of whether they have insurance," he said. "This
is something that everyone in this county should support."</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she also backs
the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Don Knabe also supports the idea of a tax to preserve
the trauma system, said his spokesman, John Musella, although he
needs to study the details of Yaroslavsky's proposal before
committing to it.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the money also could be used to add trauma
services in the east San Gabriel Valley, which lacks a trauma center.
His proposal calls for the possible establishment of trauma centers
in hospitals in Pomona and Baldwin Park or West Covina.</TE>
<TE>   He warned that $175 million would make only a dent in the county's
health deficit, and that the budget picture is still fluctuating
because the state, which funds much of the health department, is
wrestling with its own record deficit.</TE>
<TE>   But a tax could help persuade the federal government to help Los
Angeles County, Yaroslavsky and others said, by demonstrating that
residents are willing to sacrifice to keep their system operating.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Educators Share Honor</HD>
<DH>Awards: A high school instructor and an elementary teacher
are county Teachers of the Year. It's first time title has gone to
two people.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Oxnard educators lauded for building close relationships with
their students and passing their skills on to colleagues were named
Ventura County Teachers of the Year on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jeri Philbrick, a math teacher at Oxnard High School, and Tamara
Thornell, a bilingual second-grade teacher at Brekke School, received
the news before an assembly of students, teachers and administrators
in the Brekke cafeteria.</LD>
<LD>   Philbrick arrived at the ceremony after interrupting a vacation at
June Lake near Mammoth to attend what she believed was a photo
session for all the county candidates. Thornell, like all the
teachers and students at the year-round Brekke School, thought the
assembly was organized to introduce the new principal.</LD>
<TE>   "These are the most deserving Teachers of the Year we've had in
many years," county schools Supt. Charles Weis said before the
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   A committee consisting of an administrator, teacher and
non-teaching employee selected the Ventura women from teachers chosen
by each of the county's 21 school districts and private schools. The
panel based its decision on applications the teachers submitted
outlining their achievements and philosophies, as well as
recommendations from principals and superintendents, coordinator Tim
Weir said.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time in Ventura County that more than one teacher
has received the honor. Officials with the California Department of
Education say counties with more than 5,000 teachers can choose two
recipients. Ventura County has 6,600 public school teachers, Weir
said.</TE>
<TE>   Thornell and Philbrick will now enter the competition for the five
California Teachers of the Year awards, with one of the teachers
going to the national contest.</TE>
<TE>   Philbrick, 54, has taught for 31 years, all at Oxnard High School.
The math department chairwoman for 22 years, she has volunteered for
various tasks around campus and led math workshops for other
teachers. Philbrick stresses hands-on activities and connections
between math and everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   Philbrick said she believes her duties go beyond teaching to
helping students discover their own talents and develop a positive
attitude. Philbrick said she tries to build relationships with her
students similar to those she has with her two children and keeps in
close contact with many of them long after graduation.</TE>
<TE>   "She cares for students in and out of the classroom, whatever
their needs are," Oxnard Union High School District Supt. Gary Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Napoles, 22, a former student working as a teacher's
assistant at Brekke, was in the audience. "She was a great teacher,"
said Napoles, who is earning his bachelor's degree at Cal State
Northridge. "I remember she would spend time with me after class....
She would always motivate me."</TE>
<TE>   Thornell, 31, whose first child is due in November, has been
teaching for eight years. She started at Cesar Chavez School and
transferred to Brekke when it opened five years ago. She leads
technology workshops for other county educators and participates in a
model teacher program in which her lessons are videotaped to share
her methods with others.</TE>
<TE>   With her patient, friendly manner and emphasis on building
self-esteem, Thornell prides herself on turning bullies into polite
students and encouraging shy, Spanish-speaking students to volunteer
to speak in front of the class. Last year, one boy who began the
school year unable to write words was proudly writing stories by May.</TE>
<TE>   When her students return from each of their three breaks
throughout the year, Thornell asks them to write what they would like
to learn and then tailors her instruction to their interests. When a
girl one year said she wanted to learn to drive a tractor, Thornell
arranged for the class to visit a construction site.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the Teacher of the Year honors, Thornell knew she was
doing a good job by the response from her students.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine starting each day by receiving a love note from someone
you work with. Imagine starting each day by receiving flowers freshly
picked on the way to school," Thornell wrote in her application. "It
is very rewarding."</TE>

<HD>Joined Twins Turn 1; Face Surgery Soon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conjoined twins Maria de Jesus and Maria Teresa Quiej-Alvarez turn 1
today, with a chocolate frosted birthday cake and a pinata in their
UCLA hospital room.</LD>
<LD>   Surgeons hope that a bigger celebration will be in order in two
weeks. Separation surgery has been scheduled for Aug. 5 for the
Guatemalan infants, who are joined at the top of the head and face
opposite directions.</LD>
<LD>   "That's why I really have to fight for them now," said their
mother, Leticia Alba Alvarez, who came to UCLA's Mattel Children's
Hospital with the twins in May, through a translator. "When they're
separated they'll have a new life."</LD>
<TE>   Today, American relatives of the twins plan to take tamales to the
hospital to celebrate the anniversary of their uncommon birth. With
the twins' mother and hospital staff, they will break open the pinata
filled with treats and give the babies their first taste of cake.</TE>
<TE>   At home in Guatemala, their grandmothers will attend a Catholic
Mass celebrated in the twins' honor today and additional Masses
closer to the surgery date.</TE>
<TE>   Since being flown to Los Angeles by an international medical
charity, the twins have undergone numerous tests and a procedure to
ensure that there will be enough skin to close the wounds after the
main separation operation next month. Clear bandages now cover their
foreheads and scalp.</TE>
<TE>   On June 20, surgeons implanted two silicone balloons just under
their shared scalp, into which they planned to inject saline to
stretch the skin. During implantation, however, the skin over one of
the balloons tore. Doctors did not inject saline into that balloon
and removed it last week. The other remains and its stretching
continues.</TE>
<TE>   "We still think there's going to be enough [skin] to cover the
wound," said Dr. Henry Kawamoto, who leads the team of craniofacial
reconstructive surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that, the two Marias are babbling baby talk, blowing
kisses and making new sounds.</TE>
<TE>   "They are still adorable. Everybody loves them a lot," said Dr.
Jorge Lazareff, the pediatric neurosurgeon coordinating the twins'
care, who will also attend the party with other doctors and nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The infants' condition limits their movement, but the desire is
there, said Jila Shiraz, a pediatric physical therapist who has
worked with them since the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   "Maria Teresa loves to crawl. She's initiating crawling," Shiraz
said. "Maria de Jesus is an observer, very shy."</TE>
<TE>   The infants' condition also restricts what they can eat, but
physical therapists are teaching them to safely eat solids.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent them from choking, one therapist cradles a twin in her
lap while the other baby remains on a nearby bed, watched by another
therapist.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than one in 500,000 live births involve conjoined babies,
and those connected at the head are even rarer--fewer than one in 1
million live births, Lazareff said.</TE>
<TE>   The separation surgery will take at least 10 hours, but might
continue for an additional day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important steps will be separating the twins'
veins that drain into each other's heads and letting the vascular
structures of each child take the redirected blood flow, Lazareff
said. Although it would not be ideal, temporary clips may be left
overnight on the vessels to allow the other drainage systems to
compensate.</TE>
<TE>   Four pediatric anesthesiologists will work on shifts throughout
the separation, as will two teams of plastic surgeons and two teams
of neurosurgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Neurosurgeons at UCLA have never separated conjoined twins, but
they have worked on more complicated procedures before. The real
challenge, Lazareff said, is operating on two babies at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   Any anesthesia will pass through their shared bloodstream,
Lazareff said. And their physical condition complicates their
position on the operating table.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a geometry problem for us because these kids are not stuck
together symmetrically," Kawamoto said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are not sure how much time the girls will need to recover.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA enlisted the help of Biomedical Modeling Inc., a Boston-area
company, to create replicas of the twins' skulls, based on CT scans.
The company donated the models, valued at about $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   The physicians have made discoveries from the plastic models.
Kawamoto noticed that the infants' heads and faces are flattened on
their left sides and their ears are not aligned.</TE>
<TE>   "One would expect some self-correction after the twins are freed
from the prison of their position. However, complete normalization is
not expected," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Major surgery would be needed to fully alleviate the flattening,
but Kawamoto does not recommend that, since the deformity will not
inhibit jaw movement or further development.</TE>
<TE>   Born in a Guatemalan village, the two Marias spent most of their
first nine months in a pediatric intensive care unit of a government
hospital, far from their parents.</TE>
<TE>   An international charity, Healing the Children, connected Lazareff
with the babies and arranged for their travel to the United States in
May. All the physicians involved are donating their services.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Medical Center has received more than $4,000 in donations to
help pay for the twins' care, but hopes for a lot more to offset
costs estimated to exceed $1.5 million.</TE>

<HD>Longshore Backers Enlist Shoppers in Battle</HD>
<DH>Labor: Fliers ask for store patrons' support as
dockworkers' contract talks flag.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the longshore union rejected the latest contract proposal from
West Coast shippers, union supporters Wednesday tried to drum up
support for their cause at what they figured would be a promising
venue--a Home Depot in San Pedro.</LD>
<LD>   No sooner had the doors of the store opened for business at 7:30
a.m. than union sympathizers appeared at the entrance with fistfuls
of yellow fliers.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next two hours, the 10 Friends of Labor members urged
hundreds of patrons to write down the amount of their purchases on
the fliers and then give them to cashiers.</LD>
<TE>   The flier ended with a warning: "I will shop here today, but if
Home Depot does not immediately remove themselves from membership of
the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, I WILL shop elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Although the fliers singled out the coalition, the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union is locked in labor talks with shipping
firms represented by the Pacific Maritime Assn., which is a member of
the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   As the contract talks drag on inconclusively, such efforts are
likely to resonate in the blue-collar seaside communities of San
Pedro and Wilmington, whose economies are closely tied to longshore
worker incomes.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco Wednesday, ILWU officials representing workers
from across the West Coast unanimously rejected the latest PMA
proposal, then marched to a boisterous rally in front of the shipping
association's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The voice vote by 80 union representatives came after a two-day
presentation of the offer, which would have raised wages about 17%
over five years while cutting hundreds of highly paid marine clerk
positions through the introduction of new technology.</TE>
<TE>   The union claimed the PMA planned to reduce health and pension
benefits and outsource union jobs to nonunion contractors.</TE>
<TE>   PMA officials denied those charges and said the offer was
generous, given the current economic climate. They said job cuts
would be balanced by early-retirement offers and guarantees of
full-time employment to union members.</TE>
<TE>   Both the coalition and PMA have called for technological
improvements in cargo handling that have union members anxious.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides expect to meet again early next week. They are
extending the current contract, which was due to expire July 1, on a
day-to-day basis.</TE>
<TE>   The Home Depot store has been targeted, union supporters said,
because it belongs to the coalition and because of its proximity to
the Port of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous that they're taking money from us as customers
and then stabbing us in the back," said Diane Middleton, a San Pedro
attorney who represents individual longshore workers.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Lanier, executive director of the Washington D.C.-based
coalition, insisted that the union supporters' fliers wrongly labeled
her group as "nothing but a front organization for powerful shipping
interests that want to destroy labor."</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason that is mystifying to me, the union has decided
we are opposed to their interests," Lanier said. "Our issue is to
promote efficient, safe ports."</TE>
<TE>   She added: "As a side issue, we believe the ports are not
functioning correctly; they've become a bottleneck in the supply
chain. Is labor part of that problem? Absolutely. But they are not
alone. The shippers themselves are part of the problem too."</TE>
<TE>   The message delivered Wednesday to customers of the Home Depot at
the corner of Gaffey Street and Westmont Drive was not so ambiguous.</TE>
<TE>   "The Friends of Labor group and Web site exists to defend the
interests of our community and our local work force," the fliers
said. "Our motto is 'live better, work union, shop local.' "</TE>
<TE>   The leafleting began Monday. It was not clear exactly how many
patrons had filled out the fliers and turned them in to cashiers.</TE>
<TE>   But many had, and cashiers were not sure what to do with them.
Lacking guidelines from management, some threw them away while others
stashed them in their cash drawers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the store's 250 workers were quietly rooting for the
leafleteers as they followed customers pushing carts stacked with
lumber, tools and gardening supplies. Several store employees and
managers complained about annual raises of less than 50 cents an
hour, low morale and poor management.</TE>
<TE>   Donato said the leafleting may soon be expanded to include Home
Depot stores in Torrance, Carson, the San Fernando Valley, Portland,
Ore., and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Other coalition members--including Wal-Mart, Payless ShoeSource,
Target stores and Best Buy--could be targeted later.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Home Depot spokeswoman Joanne Chesler said the
leafleteers have been told about "our non-solicitation policy and
asked to stop. We consider our store to be private property."</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 7 Years for Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Crime: The preschool teacher, convicted of 11 misdemeanors,
will serve jail time for molesting his girlfriend's daughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles preschool teacher was sentenced Wednesday to seven
years in County Jail for sexually abusing his girlfriend's teenage
daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Villatoro, 42, was convicted last month of 11 misdemeanor
counts, including sexual battery, child annoyance and trying to
dissuade a witness from testifying, said Deputy City Atty. Sandra Jo
Streeter.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the jail time, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
Frank Johnson ordered Villatoro to register as a sex offender and
submit to an HIV test.</LD>
<TE>   Streeter said Villatoro began having sex with the then-13-year-old
victim a month after she moved to the United States from El Salvador
to live with her mother. The abuse took place between June 1998 and
March 2000 at the Los Feliz home they shared, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   That March the girl told school authorities that Villatoro had
fondled her breasts, then later added that he had forced her to have
sex with him, Streeter said.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office charged Villatoro with the
misdemeanors, each punishable by up to a year in County Jail, after
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to
prosecute the case, Streeter said.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said prosecutors found insufficient evidence to charge Villatoro with
felonies.</TE>
<TE>   Villatoro joined the Los Angeles Unified School District in
September 1998 and supervised infants through toddlers at one of its
children's centers, said Hilda Ramirez, a district spokeswoman. He
was placed on unpaid leave after the criminal allegations surfaced,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Villatoro's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Tyree Campbell,
declined to comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oak View residents received final approval from the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors to create a tax to buy and convert a shuttered
neighborhood school into a library and community center.</LD>
<LD>   In doing so, the community will prevent the school site from being
used for tract housing.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisors gave the plan unanimous support this week, paving
the way for about 3,500 homeowners in this enclave near Ojai to pay
the tax, beginning in November.</LD>
<TE>   Homeowners closest to the old Oak View Elementary School will pay
an annual $49 assessment; others will pay $24.50. The county will
contribute $460,000.</TE>
<TE>   The funds will cover the Ventura Unified School District's
$1.2-million price tag for the 4.6-acre school site, which was closed
two years ago. Activists are seeking private donations to renovate
the school's interior.</TE>
<TE>   Though Oak View already has a small library, the new library, to
open in 2004, would be about twice as large and would offer expanded
hours.</TE>

<HD>San Juan's Ballot May Offer Vote on Housing Tract</HD>
<DH>Election: Referendum would let residents overturn the
council's OK of Whispering Hills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ballot in San Juan Capistrano may soon become more crowded.</LD>
<LD>   Already deciding whether to sell city land to Home Depot and
picking four council members, voters may also be asked this fall
whether to block a large housing development.</LD>
<LD>   "This is probably the most full ballot in the history of the
city," City Clerk Meg Monahan said. Three weeks ago, council members
agreed to ask voters to cast an advisory vote Nov. 5 on whether the
city should sell 13 acres to Home Depot for $9 million.</LD>
<TE>   The latest proposed referendum, which the council on Tuesday could
put on the ballot, results from a petition drive that ended this
week. On Monday, Monahan verified 1,833 voter signatures challenging
the housing project; 1,621 were required.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed referendum would overturn last month's council
approval of Whispering Hills, a 175-home tract proposed for the
eastern foothills. The project includes a high school that would open
in September 2005; if built it would be the first public high school
in town since 1963.</TE>
<TE>   But a citizens group that has fought the project for four
years--Citizens Against Uncontrolled San Juan Expansion--gathered
signatures in an effort to ask voters to override the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents unsuccessfully urged city officials this year to
consider a scaled-down version of the plan that would allow 103
homes. That plan would spare one of two canyons affected by
Whispering Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Nielson, a leader of the opposition, stressed that the
council could have ensured construction of the high school by
approving the alternative--but did not. "I'm sure our opponents will
see this referendum as opposition to the high school," Nielsen said.</TE>
<TE>   At its meeting Tuesday, the council can choose to repeal the
project approval or certify the petition. Monahan said the successful
petition places the Whispering Hills project on hold until after the
Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman David M. Swerdlin, who voted for the development, isn't
sure what the council will do.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally think this petition is anti-community and
anti-school," he said. "Frankly, I think it stems from a
not-in-my-backyard attitude."</TE>
<TE>   The referendums also figure to dominate the regularly scheduled
council election. Ten residents have announced their intentions to
enter the race.</TE>

<HD>House Passes Antiabortion Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the House, antiabortion forces again pushed through a ban on a
specific abortion procedure despite past legislative failures, court
challenges and an uncertain future in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The bill to ban what opponents call "partial-birth" abortion,
taken up on an almost annual basis since Republicans gained control
of the House in 1995, passed 274 to 151.</LD>
<LD>   President Clinton vetoed the legislation twice, in 1996 and 1997,
but this time supporters of the ban have the Oval Office on their
side. The White House said in a statement that it strongly supports
the bill, saying it is "morally imperative and constitutionally
permissible to prohibit this very abhorrent form of abortion."</LD>
<TE>   But first, it must be considered by the Democratic-controlled
Senate, and Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he
didn't know if that would happen before this session of Congress
ends.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many things on the plate," Daschle said, "that we're
going to have to make some decisions about what merits the highest
priority."</TE>

<HD>Drive-By Blowgun Attacks in Washington Area Baffle

<DH>Crime: At least 19 people have been hit by 4-inch darts.
Police don't know who's responsible or if the assaults that started
last month are linked.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If they thought their worst summer predators were mosquitoes or deer
flies, residents of Washington and a neighboring suburb have been in
for an unpleasant surprise.</LD>
<LD>   At least 19 people have reported being struck by 4-inch steel
blowgun darts in a series of attacks that began last month and, so
far, has left authorities stymied. Seven people have been treated for
injuries at hospitals, including one man who required surgery on his
abdomen, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The culprit is still on the loose, police said, and beyond a few
shaky leads, there is little evidence linking the bizarre incidents
and no indication whether there is a single perpetrator or several.</LD>
<TE>   Blowguns are illegal in California and Massachusetts, although
they are sold legally elsewhere over the Internet, in sporting
catalogs and at gun shows. Under California law, making, selling or
possessing a blowgun is a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   If captured, the culprit in the Washington area faces charges of
assault with a dangerous weapon, police said. And if convicted, the
shooter could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison on each count
if the person is over age 18, said Channing Phillips, a spokesman for
the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the victims suffered superficial injuries, authorities
said. Some came forward only after hearing news reports of other
attacks. In at least one case, the dart missed its intended target.
Police in Washington and Prince George's County in suburban
Maryland--where four of the attacks occurred--are investigating.
Authorities are asking witnesses and patrons of gun shows to come
forward with any evidence, such as home videos, that may show the
perpetrator buying or using the weapon.</TE>
<TE>   District of Columbia Police Chief Charles Ramsey has announced a
$2,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in
the case.</TE>
<TE>   For tips leading to arrest and indictment, a community group,
Crime Solvers, is offering an additional $1,000 reward.</TE>
<TE>   Accounts of the circumstances in the incidents vary wildly.</TE>
<TE>   Some victims reported seeing a white Cadillac around the time they
were struck, while others said they saw a white Chevrolet. One man
who was hit in the elbow while walking on the side of the road said
he saw a blowgun poking out the window of a white van, police
spokeswoman Cpl. Diane Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent victim, a 10-year-old boy hit around noon Friday,
suffered minor injuries but said he saw a man with dreadlocks, who
appeared to be in his late teens, driving a black car near the scene.
He did not see the man use the blowgun.</TE>
<TE>   Because the darts are small and silent, they are more discreet
than other weapons and make determining the source more difficult,
said Washington police spokesman Sgt. Joe Gentile.</TE>
<TE>   All darts collected in the recent spate have been similar in size
and made out of sharpened steel piano wire, Gentile said.</TE>
<TE>   The darts have been tested at an FBI crime lab for traces of
harmful substances, although the test results were not available.</TE>
<TE>   Standard blowguns, which cost as little as $12, can be fired
accurately from as far as 100 to 200 feet, said blowgun dealer Dianna
Vann of Lake Stevens, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   The guns are operated by loading a dart into the mouthpiece and
exhaling forcefully.</TE>
<TE>   News reports dating as far back as 1976 tell menacing tales
similar to recent attacks. Though the weapons can inflict potentially
lethal wounds, serious injuries are uncommon, officials and dealers
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Maryland, one hunting store owner said he refuses to sell
blowguns.</TE>
<TE>   ''They're fine in the jungle, maybe to shoot monkeys out of the
trees, but I don't feel there's a need for them here,'' said Jim
Riffle, who has owned the Bay Trading Post for five years. ''They
create more problems than they do good.''</TE>

<LD>   The White House stood firmly behind President Bush's plan for
workers to divert some of their Social Security payroll taxes into
the stock market, despite the dramatic drops Wall Street has suffered
in recent months.</LD>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer took a swing at the
existing Social Security program, calling it "dangerous" to "let
people pay a lifetime of high taxes for a Social Security benefit
that under current projections they'll never receive."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer made clear that Bush continues to favor permitting
Americans to take a portion of the taxes they ordinarily contribute
to the Social Security trust fund and invest it on their own. "That
would include markets," Fleischer said.</TE>

<HD>8 Named to Review Misconduct by Catholic Clergy</HD>
<DH>Religion: Two from California and abuse survivor are
included on the board. Members of an activist group, however, are
omitted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vowing to restore faith in a church battered by sex abuse scandals,
the head of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops Wednesday announced
the appointment of eight additional members, including two
Californians, to a new clergy misconduct review board.</LD>
<LD>   Although the all-lay board includes a former abuse victim, the
nation's largest victims' group, Survivors Network of Those Abused by
Priests, failed to win an appointment and immediately expressed
concern about the review panel's independence.</LD>
<LD>   The board president, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, said the
board would actively solicit the abuse network's input. But he said
network members were "angry and agenda-filled" activists whose
prosecutorial zeal was inappropriate for the review panel's judicial
nature. Keating said he and the board's three other core members, who
were appointed last month by bishops' conference President Wilton D.
Gregory, decided to exclude the victims' organization.</LD>
<TE>   Keating, a former prosecutor and FBI agent, vowed that the
13-member panel would aggressively seek to end what he called these
"dark nights" of the church.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not intend to be apologists ... for corrupt acts or
indifference or evasion," Keating said in a conference call with
reporters Wednesday. "All of us are independent-minded individuals.
All of us deeply love our faith. But all of us are shocked and
outraged" by the sex scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The new national board members are all practicing Catholics drawn
from the media, legal, medical and business worlds. They include
Alice Bourke Hayes, president of the University of San Diego, and
Leon E. Panetta, head of a Bay Area think tank who served in Congress
and was chief of staff to President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The lay board will monitor the progress of the nation's 192
dioceses in carrying out a "zero tolerance" policy against abusers,
which was approved by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in
Dallas in June. It will also commission studies on the cause, context
and extent of sex abuse by priests, ensure that allegations are
properly referred to law enforcement and, according to Keating, seek
to make "all financial transactions fully transparent."</TE>
<TE>   The policy adopted in Dallas calls for the ouster from public
ministry of any priest or deacon who has abused minors, the formation
of local lay review boards to monitor cases and the establishment of
a national Office for Child and Youth Protection. The office will
work in tandem with the national oversight board, which is scheduled
to meet July 30 in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the scandals have led to the payment of millions of
dollars in legal claims, the resignation of at least four bishops and
the ouster of more than 250 priests.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, more than 60 priests are under
investigation for alleged sex abuse, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has
apologized for mishandling some cases, such as reassigning a
self-confessed abuser, Father Michael Baker, before finally ousting
him in 2000. In recent months, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles has
toughened its policies on abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Other members announced Wednesday are William R. Burleigh, board
chairman and former chief executive of the E.W. Scripps Co. in
Kentucky; Nicholas P. Cafardi, dean of Duquesne University Law School
in Pittsburgh; Jane Chiles, former director of the Kentucky State
Catholic Conference; Pamela D. Hayes, a New York attorney
specializing in criminal defense and civil rights; Paul R. McHugh,
chairman of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore; and Ray H.
Siegfried II, board chairman of the NORDAM Group, an international
aviation service and manufacturing firm in Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory, in a statement, said that board membership demonstrated
"that the bishops are seeking the forthright advice of the laity to
help resolve this crisis.... "</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, were less optimistic. "It's a prestigious group,
but what's needed is not necessarily prestige but independence," said
David Clohessy, national director of the survivors' network. Clohessy
and others said they were disappointed that the "collective wisdom of
survivors of clergy abuse" would not be represented.</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Bland, an abuse survivor, former priest and
clinical-pastoral coordinator for victim assistance in the Chicago
archdiocese, is one of the board's four core members. But the
survivors' networks suggested he is too close to the church to be
independent.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Keating and Bland, the core members are Robert S. Bennett,
a former federal prosecutor who practices civil litigation in
Washington, and Anne M. Burke, justice of the Illinois Appellate
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy said it appeared that Keating was backing down from tough
talk in Dallas to pursue prosecutions or Vatican removal of bishops
who cover up abuse. In a USA Today article last month, Keating said
he would not seek either measure against bishops.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, however, Keating said it was primarily the diocesan
review board's job to pursue its own bishops, but "if they turn their
heads against evil ... yes, we will get involved."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the differences, Clohessy and Keating reaffirmed their
desire to work together to protect children.</TE>

<HD>Medicare Bill That's More Costly for Seniors Is Killed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senators on Wednesday rejected a Republican-backed Medicare bill that
would require elderly patients to pay substantial prescription drug
costs before government help kicked in.</LD>
<LD>   The 51-48 vote on a $160-billion measure came as lawmakers
continued to work on a compromise Medicare proposal after rejecting
two plans Tuesday: one for $594 billion offered by Democrats and the
other for $370 billion proposed by a group of Republicans, a Democrat
and the Senate's lone independent. The bills needed 60 votes to pass.</LD>
<LD>   A group of Republican and Democratic senators met Wednesday
evening to discuss a compromise that Finance Committee Chairman Sen.
Max Baucus (D-Mont.) was writing.</LD>
<TE>   That plan would cost about $400 billion over 10 years, according
to a Democratic aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Committee spokesman Michael Siegel confirmed that the compromise
would allow private insurers to administer the benefit.</TE>
<TE>   In areas that typically have trouble attracting private insurers,
such as rural parts of the country, the government would try to lure
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the rejected $160-billion proposal said the plan
deserved a second look.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a base to work with," said Sen. Charles Hagel
(R-Neb.), an author of the plan with Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the two other plans, which require the government to pay a
portion of a senior's drug costs immediately, the plan considered
Wednesday helps mostly poor and middle-income senior citizens only
after they have already spent a considerable amount of money on
prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   It incorporates President Bush's call to promote private drug
discount cards as a way for seniors to save money on prescriptions.</TE>

<HD>Bush Sees Victory in Calming Market</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush and his top advisors have decided to take a page from
the Vietnam War era in their handling of the current stock market
turmoil and economic jitters: They declared victory and went home.</LD>
<LD>   In interviews Wednesday, senior administration officials made
clear the White House thinks it has done all it can--and should--to
calm the markets and buoy the economy.</LD>
<LD>   All that's left is to convince people the results are a victory,
something Bush's economic team fanned out to do in a burst of
speeches, interviews and TV appearances.</LD>
<TE>   "Sound policy did the job that needed to be done," declared
Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic advisor. "Based
on the evidence now before us, we've been successful in stabilizing
the economy and returning it to growth."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the recent upheaval in stock prices, which crumbled
for four months before rising Wednesday, Lindsey would only say: "The
economy is doing well."</TE>
<TE>   The White House decision to highlight the economy's soundness and
its role in achieving it follows weeks of fretfulness by senior
administration aides and several false starts by the president
himself. On Monday, Bush appeared to violate a cardinal rule of
economic policymaking by suggesting it was time for Americans to go
back to buying stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average promptly
dropped 234 points.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the new strategy is up to the job of mending tattered
investor confidence and shielding the economy sparked a lively
debate, and substantial doubts, Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sympathetic observers said the president should be helped by
Congress' speedy action on legislation to tighten oversight of
accountants and toughen criminal penalties for fraud, and by the
highly publicized arrest Wednesday of cable TV mogul John Rigas and
four others on charges of looting Pennsylvania-based Adelphia
Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   These observers said the White House is probably right to conclude
there is little more it can do to calm the markets.</TE>
<TE>   "People are used to [Bush] dealing with issues of national
security as the commander in chief," said Robert D. Hormats, vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a senior official in both
the Carter and Reagan administrations. "But he's not the commander in
chief of the economy or the markets. He can't make them do what he
wants them to do."</TE>
<TE>   However, in arguing, in effect, that the steps he has already
taken are enough, Bush runs the risk of appearing to be headed down
the same path as his father, whose sky-high popularity after the
Persian Gulf War vanished when the economy soured in the early 1990s,
leaving him vulnerable to political attack by Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's one thing everyone presumed, it was that this White
House was smart enough to avoid letting the son repeat the mistakes
of the father, but that's what they seem to be doing," said former
California congressman and Clinton chief of staff Leon E. Panetta,
now a director of the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing the criticisms of other Democrats and many in the business
community, Panetta said that Bush's response to recent market turmoil
has been weak and uncertain, in sharp contrast to his decisiveness in
answering the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The president called for some modest new pension protections in
February and advanced a 10-point investor protection plan in early
March that, among other things, required top executives to personally
vouch for the accuracy of their companies' financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Then he largely dropped the issue until earlier this month when,
amid rising clamor for action, he called for tough new criminal
sanctions on fraud, created the corporate fraud task force and asked
for $100 million more for the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The president's pension proposals focused largely on freeing
workers from employer-imposed restrictions on selling company stock
in their retirement accounts. But many pension experts say this is a
comparatively minor problem.</TE>
<TE>   When he finally issued his call for tough new sanctions on fraud,
the president confused lawmakers by appearing to embrace provisions
in the then-drastically different Senate and House bills.</TE>
<TE>   Panetta and others were particularly critical of Bush's economic
team, which is headed by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and,
besides Lindsey, includes budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. and
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisors. They are compared unfavorably to Robert E. Rubin, the
Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is not highly regarded. [The White House] has to decide
whether they are going to get on top of this wave or be drowned by
it," Panetta said of the recent market tumble.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, a senior administration official said that the
president retained full confidence in his advisors, despite criticism
of O'Neill for traveling overseas during the market crisis, of
Daniels for alienating lawmakers of both parties with his
abrasiveness and of Lindsey for being politically ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   However, the White House this week ordered O'Neill to cancel a
South American trip because "Congress is at a critical juncture" on
legislation aimed at corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said some economists and market participants have warned Bush that
the recent market turmoil could turn into an economy-damaging nose
dive.</TE>
<TE>   But he said that aides have concluded they can reestablish
investor confidence by calling attention to tough action taken
against alleged corporate wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   This official said the president and his aides are so sure of the
economy's ability to survive the market downturn that they have drawn
up no contingency plan in case of a steep, new plunge. He suggested
that Bush is equally confident of Republicans' ability to weather the
political dangers of a diving market.</TE>
<TE>   But some Republicans aren't so sure. GOP pollster Bill McInturff
has been warning Republican candidates that the market rout is
sending key poll numbers plunging.</TE>
<TE>   A new poll by McInturff's firm shows that a majority of American
now think the country is on the "wrong track." That is up from only
20% last fall.</TE>

<HD>A 'Brave Little Girl' Gets Back to Normal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The rumor going around 7-year-old Erica Pratt's blighted neighborhood
was that her family had come into money. A lot of money.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors thought maybe that's why two men had snatched the little
girl from the sidewalk in front of her grandmother's home Monday
night and someone had called the family demanding $150,000 in
exchange for Erica's life.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the motive, the plot was foiled Tuesday night. Police
said the "brave little girl" chewed through duct tape binding her
hands , and broke out of the locked basement in an abandoned home
where she had been held for almost 24 hours.</LD>
<TE>   The hunt for her two abductors continued Wednesday. Police say the
two men wanted for questioning--James Burns, 29, and Edward Johnson,
23--are known to the girl's family.</TE>
<TE>   If the kidnappers had planned a get-rich-quick scheme, they picked
an unusual target.</TE>
<TE>   The Pratts are far from wealthy, family members and neighbors
said. Their home sits on a block peppered with abandoned buildings.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon Wednesday, Erica was racing through her old
neighborhood, smiling, waving to reporters and playing tag with
friends who a day earlier had been talking solemnly about a playmate
who might never return.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in bright pink, with barrettes in her hair, Erica fidgeted
in the arms of a relative and buried her face in a stuffed animal
when asked to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Police said she suffered only minor injuries in her ordeal and
relatives said she was recovering well.</TE>
<TE>   "She seems totally normal," uncle Joseph Moore Jr. said. "If she's
forgotten about what happened, I'd just as soon it would stay
forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Police said Erica had only a can of water during her ordeal, and
the officers who found her gave her part of a chicken sandwich.</TE>

<HD>Fuel Tank Leak Tests Questioned</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Texas company will plead guilty to 10 felony
counts of making false claims, U.S. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's largest tester for leaks in underground gasoline storage
tanks was charged Wednesday with faking results at federal facilities
in 10 states, including California.</LD>
<LD>   Tanknology-NDE International Inc. of Austin, Texas, has agreed to
plead guilty to 10 felony counts of making false claims to the
federal government and to pay fines and restitution totaling $2.29
million, the Justice Department said.</LD>
<LD>   The charges grew out of a two-year investigation in which
Tanknology employees were found to have failed to follow required
test protocols and in some instances never performed the tests at
all. In some cases, employees were videotaped engaging in what
authorities characterized as "drive-by" tests of storage
facilities--driving away after a few minutes and then submitting
faked data.</LD>
<TE>   In Southern California, the company admitted in its plea agreement
to fabricating test results for storage tanks at postal facilities in
Santa Clarita, Oxnard and Goleta.</TE>
<TE>   Other sites where the firm acknowledged faking results include the
Great Lakes Naval Training Center in Illinois, the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida, Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts, Brooks
Air Force Base in Texas, and facilities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, Arizona and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   The government said it has no evidence that the environment was
harmed by any of the company's violations.</TE>
<TE>   Tanknology officials and their lawyers could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of underground storage tanks containing gasoline and other
petroleum products are required by law to have their tanks tested
periodically to ensure against leaks into the soil and ground water.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the nation's nearly 1 million underground storage
tanks are in Southern California. Two of the country's largest
Superfund sites--the San Fernando Valley Water Basin and the San
Gabriel Valley Water Basin--were contaminated by leaking underground
fuel storage tanks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the "drive-by" tests, Tanknology admitted creating
a work climate that encouraged employees to cheat.</TE>
<TE>   Regional managers set unreasonable schedules for testers,
according to the plea agreement. A corporate bonus system rewarded
employees who conducted the most tests.</TE>
<TE>   The company also admitted that quality control personnel were
rebuffed when they complained that testers were inadequately trained
and were performing shoddy work.</TE>
<TE>   Tanknology has more than 500 employees and services more than
3,000 clients in the public and private sectors, according to federal
documents. Since 1992, it has performed periodic tests for leaks at
more than 180 federal facilities.</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks to Limit Malpractice Suits</HD>
<DH>Reform: Such a move 'will turn aspects of the health-care
system into an even bigger death trap,' one opponent says. But HHS
paper touts benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush plans to call today for stringent new curbs on
malpractice lawsuits against health-care providers and insurance
companies, contending that limiting such litigation will lower the
cost of care and increase the number of medical specialists,
administration officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But while any move to impose such restrictions will please
providers and insurers, it is likely to enrage many consumer groups
and energize the nation's already active trial lawyers to resist such
efforts.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech today in Greensboro, N.C., the president will urge
Congress to enact sweeping reforms of medical malpractice litigation,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation that Bush will endorse is modeled largely on
California's law, which critics say has inflicted further pain on
patients who have already been hurt by the cost-cutting health
maintenance organization system.</TE>
<TE>   In advance of Bush's speech, Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson released a policy paper Wednesday, saying that
malpractice litigation reform would improve public access to health
care, encourage efforts to improve quality of care and reduce
excesses and abuses in the current system.</TE>
<TE>   "California led the way for the nation by establishing statewide
limits on malpractice claims 25 years ago, with bipartisan support,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We should learn from the successes of California and other states
that have successfully reformed their malpractice systems."</TE>
<TE>   The report squarely blames the rapidly increasing cost of
malpractice insurance for an array of problems in the nation's
health-care system, from the sharp inflation in overall costs to the
reduction in the number of specialists.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer advocacy groups denounced the drive to impose federal
limits on malpractice litigation, a move that faces uncertain
prospects in Congress. Opponents quickly reacted late Wednesday as
word of the administration's intentions spread.</TE>
<TE>   "Limiting liability for providers, who are already pressured by
HMOs to cut corners and be less cautious, will turn aspects of the
health-care system into an even bigger death trap," said Jamie Court,
executive director of the California-based Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians have paid for the limited liability of providers and
insurers' profitability with their health and their lives. These
restrictions should be lifted in California, not imposed nationwide,"
he said, adding: "California is a failed model for anyone but
malpractice insurers."</TE>
<TE>   The HHS report painted a far different picture.</TE>
<TE>   It noted, for instance, that Las Vegas' only Level 1 trauma center
recently closed temporarily when surgeons quit after their
malpractice premiums increased by as much as 500%.</TE>
<TE>   The report also cited estimates that the cost of malpractice
insurance for specialists has risen more than 10% in recent years and
could increase by an average of 20% or more before the end of this
year. In states with no limit on noneconomic damages, such as
payments for "pain and suffering" or "loss of companionship," doctors
are seeing 30% to 50% increases in premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also is expected to call for a plan called Early Offers,
which would encourage doctors to offer economic compensation to
patients soon after an injury and encourage patients to accept the
offer.</TE>
<TE>   The report also suggested adoption of strengthened medical review
panels that would provide streamlined disposition of malpractice
claims, with incentives for doctors and patients to use them and
accept their judgments.</TE>
<TE>   Along with health-care costs in general, malpractice insurance
premiums have resumed their sharp climb after leveling off in the
mid-1990s, after President Clinton's failed in efforts to revamp the
nation's health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   The ever-increasing premiums are prompting health-care providers,
particularly in specialties such as surgery or obstetrics, to
drastically curtail their practices--or to quit them altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Without federal legislation, the exodus may worsen, and patients
could find it increasingly difficult to obtain needed services, said
Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), a moderate who has introduced a bill
to impose limits on the ability of patients to file malpractice
lawsuits--and to collect huge awards.</TE>
<TE>   His bill, which has nearly 100 co-sponsors, would limit the number
of years that a plaintiff has to file a lawsuit, allocate damages in
proportion to a party's degree of culpability, impose a $250,000 cap
on noneconomic damages, and limit punitive damages at $250,000 or
twice the amount of economic damages, whichever is greater.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reform the nation's health-care system have foundered
for more than a decade, even as costs have soared and the ranks of
the uninsured have swelled. Indeed, few issues have proved so
contentious--and intractable--for Congress and the White House to
deal with.</TE>
<TE>   Just this week, for example, the Senate failed to agree on
competing proposals to provide Medicare recipients with coverage for
prescription drugs--an increasing problem for the elderly as the
prices of medications skyrocket.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Hearing Delay Is Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A lawyer for Zacarias Moussaoui asked a federal judge Wednesday to
delay a hearing scheduled for today at which the accused terrorist
has vowed to plead guilty to charges of conspiracy in the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Frank W. Dunham Jr. filed the motion asking U.S. District Judge
Leonie M. Brinkema to halt the pretrial proceedings so that Moussaoui
can undergo additional mental competency examinations. Dunham also
asked the judge to take more time to consider his motions challenging
the Justice Department's effort to seek the death penalty against
Moussaoui.</LD>
<LD>   Dunham, chief public defender for the Eastern District of
Virginia, is one of several lawyers serving as standby counsel for
Moussaoui, who is acting as his own lawyer after Brinkema ruled that
he is competent to mount his own defense. Moussaoui, 34, has refused
to talk to Dunham or his other court-appointed lawyers and has
informally enlisted the aid of a Muslim lawyer from Texas, Charles
Freeman, in his defense.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui, a French militant of Moroccan descent, has filed
motions accusing the judge and defense lawyers of trying to kill him.
Dunham said such motions, and other statements by Moussaoui, indicate
that he is seriously mentally ill and not able to represent himself
in court, much less plead guilty to charges that could result in his
execution.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema has rejected Dunham's earlier requests to find Moussaoui
mentally incompetent to represent himself. But she has also tried to
ensure that Moussaoui understands the legal implications of his
actions, since he has no formal legal training.</TE>
<TE>   The judge was expected to rule on Dunham's most recent court
motion late Wednesday or early today, before the afternoon hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Dunham said in an interview that he expects the judge to press
forward with the case, even though Freeman has also made a similar
request to postpone today's hearing in an appeal to the U.S. 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department on Wednesday told the 4th Circuit appellate
panel that it opposed any effort to halt today's scheduled
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   ''Freeman is a self-proclaimed out-of-court legal advisor who has
filed this petition ... in a last-ditch effort to prevent Moussaoui
from carrying through with his stated intent to plead guilty on July
25, 2002,'' prosecutors wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In its motion, the Justice Department noted that since Moussaoui
has insisted on representing himself, Freeman should not be permitted
to file court motions acting in his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   ''While a guilty plea may be offensive to Freeman, it does not
appear to be so to Moussaoui, and Freeman's sensitivities should have
no bearing on this case,'' the prosecutors wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The 4th Circuit also had not ruled on the motion to halt
proceedings by the close of business Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui stunned the courtroom last week when he admitted his
allegiance to the Al Qaeda terrorist organization and tried to enter
a guilty plea on six charges of conspiracy relating to the Sept. 11
attacks. Brinkema refused to accept the plea, ordering Moussaoui to
take a week to think about whether he really wanted to plead guilty.
Moussaoui indicated he would enter a guilty plea today as well.</TE>
<TE>   ''Bet on it,'' Moussaoui responded to the judge. ''I will.''</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui is the only person charged in the U.S. as an accomplice
to the 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks. Authorities
say he was part of the plot and that he may have been intending to be
the 20th hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm tired of guessing what he's going to do,'' Dunham said.
''Here's a guy who complained that his defense lawyers were trying to

<HD>Left, Right Join in Medical Pot Fight</HD>
<DH>Law: Libertarians and liberals rally behind long-shot bill
favoring medicinal marijuana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>By their own admission, the medicinal marijuana advocates who
gathered Wednesday in a basement room of the Capitol made up a
bizarre partnership. And they agreed that their cause--getting the
federal government to butt out of states' laws on the use of
marijuana for medical purposes--was pretty much hopeless right now.</LD>
<LD>   But a former aide to President Reagan and several members of
Congress--including an openly gay, die-hard liberal, a onetime
Libertarian presidential candidate and a Southern California
Republican known for wearing puka shells and surfing--said the time
had come to push the matter with a reluctant Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   "Nine states have decided to allow physicians to prescribe medical
marijuana," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), one of the bipartisan
authors of HR 2592, which was introduced a year ago but has yet to
make it out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to the floor
for debate. "What our bill does is to say [that] in those states,
there will be no federal prohibition on such use."</LD>
<TE>   Eight Western states--Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington--and Maine have laws letting
doctors to prescribe marijuana to patients suffering from illnesses
such as glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, AIDS and cancer. Proponents of
medical marijuana use contend that for these patients, it relieves a
variety of symptoms--including pain, nausea and loss of
appetite--with minimal side effects.</TE>
<TE>   But state laws permitting medical marijuana clash with federal
regulation of illegal narcotics. That has resulted in federal
prosecutions of individuals who, under state law, have committed no
crime.</TE>
<TE>   In its first review of a medical marijuana initiative passed by
state voters in 1996, the California Supreme Court last week ruled
unanimously that residents who grow marijuana for personal medical
use are protected from state prosecution if they have their doctor's
approval. However, the U.S. Supreme Court, considering the California
initiative last year, ruled that marijuana offered no "medical
benefits worthy of exception" to federal anti-drug laws.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas)--the former Libertarian presidential
candidate--called the denial of access to marijuana to suffering
patients "criminal."</TE>
<TE>   "Where are the compassionate conservatives today? They're not
here, and they should be," Paul said, arguing that decriminalizing
marijuana, which he dubbed a "so-called illegal drug," would be
restoring rights lost to federal oversight in the early 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get over some of the stereotypes and hangovers from the
'60s," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach--the only
California Republican to sign on to the bill so far.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the bill emphasized that its scope was very narrow--to
stop interference by federal law enforcement agencies in the
distribution of medical marijuana where states allow it. The
legislation, they said, was not meant to open the door to broader
legalization of pot, although some boosters of the bill, such as the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, have pushed
for such change.</TE>
<TE>   Lyn Nofziger, an aide to Reagan in both Sacramento and Washington,
spoke of his daughter's painful death from cancer a decade ago. Her
suffering, he said, was relieved only by her family's illicit
acquisition of marijuana for her use. The experience turned him into
a staunch supporter of the medicinal use of the drug, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Marijuana "did not save her life, nor did we think it would," said
Nofziger, 78. "But it made a portion of the last weeks of her life
more bearable to her and her family.</TE>
<TE>   "An administration who claimed to be compassionate and
conservative should support this legislation. People are being denied
help by others who simply don't give a damn."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Miller of Cherry Hill, N.J.--whose wife, Cheryl, 56, was
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1971--pleaded with lawmakers to
at least allow the issue to come up for debate. It was his wife's
ninth trip to the Capitol to address the issue and likely her last,
because of her condition, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tired of hit-and-run from legislators who say marijuana is
bad and won't listen," Miller said. "It's too late for Cheryl--but
there are a lot of other Cheryls out there, and it's not too late for
them."</TE>

<HD>Congress in Accord on Business Reform Bill</HD>
<DH>Law: Bush will get the measure today. It offers the most
stringent rules since the 1930s, creating an independent board to
oversee auditing, ethics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>House and Senate negotiators reached agreement Wednesday on
legislation to tighten oversight of the accounting industry and
increase criminal penalties for corporate fraud. President Bush will
receive the bill today, after final votes in the House and Senate,
and is expected to sign it.</LD>
<LD>   The measure authorizes the most far-reaching new business
regulation since the 1930s. It creates an independent board to set
auditing and ethics rules and to discipline auditors, and it makes
corporate officers more accountable for their companies' financial
statements.</LD>
<LD>   The unusually swift action and nearly unanimous vote by
negotiators from the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-led
Senate underscored the anxiety in Washington about the potential
economic and political repercussions of the rash of business scandals
that have cost investors billions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation was drafted in response to the collapse last year
of Enron Corp. and to the role played by its auditor, Arthur
Andersen, in helping conceal the company's precarious financial
condition. After languishing for months, the bill gained momentum
from disclosures of accounting abuses at several other big
companies--and finally took off after reports emerged in late June of
WorldCom's nearly $4-billion accounting misstatement.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise legislation closely resembles the Senate measure,
which was regarded as tougher than the bill approved by the House.
But it includes provisions approved by the House to mandate prison
sentences of as long as 25 years for corporate wrongdoers, to set up
a fund to reimburse defrauded investors from fines paid by corporate
wrongdoers and to require companies to disclose material changes to
their financial conditions in a more timely manner.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who called the legislation crucial to restoring investor
confidence in financial markets, hailed the agreement. "Today was a
day of action and a day of accomplishment in Washington, D.C.," said
Bush, whose aides are worried about the possibly negative effect the
recent rash of corporate scandals could have on the president's
approval ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Press Secretary Ari Fleischer used the word "accomplishment" a
dozen times in his regular briefing for reporters. He sought to link
the White House to the work of Congress, while urging both houses to
complete work on the measure before they begin their summer recess.</TE>
<TE>   "The president looks forward to signing it into law," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), a principal author of the
legislation, said it "reflects our determination to see that the
confidence of investors in our capital markets is restored."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), who presided over the
negotiations, added that the bill "goes a long way in solving some of
the egregious problems that have arisen as a result of corporate
misconduct and accounting scandals."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), who cast the only conference committee
vote against the measure, complained that the politics of the issue
had overtaken reason.</TE>
<TE>   "In the environment we're in, virtually anything could have passed
the Congress," he said. He objected that the bill creates a
"one-size-fits-all prescription" by imposing new rules on 16,254
public companies, regardless of size.</TE>
<TE>   Opinions varied about what effect the legislation would have on
the markets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Congress had to act," said Sen. Robert F. Bennett
(R-Utah). "But I think all of us should take a somewhat sobering dose
of humility and recognize that the markets don't pay as much
attention to us as we pay to ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Frederick M. Richardson, an accounting professor at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University, said: "If market
participants believe that the bill will increase accounting
independence and get management attention with the stronger penalties
for using accounting methods to inflate results, then confidence
should improve and the markets improve accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Valliere, chief strategist for Schwab Washington Research
Group, said the bill could provide an important "psychological plus
for investors who want to see something, anything, get done."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation will fundamentally change the way public
companies--and accountants--do business, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time in the history of financial regulation in this
country, the legislation will create a truly independent accounting
oversight board to enforce rules and prosecute violators," said James
Hamilton, an expert in securities law at CCH Inc., a provider of
information on tax and business law.</TE>
<TE>   That oversight board will replace the accounting industry's
self-policing approach to discipline. It will be funded by publicly
traded companies. The Bush administration had expressed concern about
jurisdictional conflicts between the new board and the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The agreement would strengthen SEC oversight of
the board.</TE>
<TE>   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, an
industry trade group that lobbied against some provisions of the
bill, said changes required by the legislation will be "dramatic and
challenging." The group pledged to "work cooperatively" with firms
auditing public companies to help them adapt to the changes.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce--which also objected to certain provisions, such as
extending the time frame for plaintiffs to bring securities fraud
lawsuits against companies--said, "Creating a new class of corporate
criminals, inviting attorneys into boardrooms and reducing the
ability of business owners to make decisions about their companies'
operations could have significant, unintended consequences."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group for
chief executives of major corporations, called the agreement "the
right bill at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the measure would prevent future Enrons. It will
require companies to disclose off-balance-sheet transactions and
conflicts, such as the ones used by the energy giant to hide hundreds
of millions of dollars in losses.</TE>
<TE>   It would bar accounting firms from providing most consulting
services to companies they audit but give the watchdog panel for the
accounting industry authority to grant exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   The lucrative consulting fees Enron auditor Andersen got from the
firm were seen as a factor that prevented auditors from aggressively
challenging Enron's questionable accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would accelerate the reporting of stock trades by
company insiders, a measure that would have alerted other Enron
investors sooner of what Enron insiders were doing with their stock.</TE>
<TE>   The measure prohibits public companies from making loans to
executives, but the ban won't apply retroactively or to credit cards
issued by businesses to their employees or to margin loans for
employees at securities firms.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiators removed a provision from the Senate-passed
legislation that would have subjected corporate officers to criminal
penalties for recklessly filing false financial statements. "You
shouldn't be sent to jail for bad management," Bennett said.
Corporate officers still will be subject to prosecution if they
willfully file misleading information.</TE>
<TE>   The measure includes criminal penalties for securities fraud and
document shredding, and protections for corporate whistle-blowers.</TE>
<TE>   It also bars senior executives from selling company stock during
periods when lower-ranking employees cannot sell company stock in
their retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement did little to slow the political maneuvering over
who is responding more aggressively to the accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), noting that the House
approved its bill months before the Senate, said, "If the Senate had
acted earlier, the markets wouldn't be where they are today."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.), noting that the bill includes a
number of measures Republicans previously resisted, said the
agreement represented "the Republicans' unconditional surrender."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) added: "This is a bill for more
regulation. This is a bill for more government.... What we see here
is a consensus that increasing regulation is in no way inconsistent
with respect for the private sector; that in fact, the role of
sensible regulation ... is to enhance the capitalist system."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) renewed his call for
SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt's resignation after hearing of Pitt's
efforts to amend the bill to raise his pay from $138,200 to $166,700
a year and to elevate his office to Cabinet status.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the things that he has to think about, it is amazing to me
that this is what he's spending his time thinking about," Daschle
said. The amendment was not included in the final version of the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers Union called the legislation a "major step forward" but
said more legislation is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We need pension reforms," the group said in statement. "More is
needed to help employees and investors whose savings were wiped out
by scandals like Enron and WorldCom recoup their losses. We support
legislation in California to deter accounting fraud by imposing a
cooling-off period on individual accountants handling audits of
public companies, as well as a California anti-shredding law."</TE>

<HD>Senators Offer Changes to Homeland Security Bill</HD>
<DH>Congress: They would expand Bush proposals and protect
disclosure made by private businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rewriting a key provision in President Bush's plan for a Department
of Homeland Security, Senate Democrats pushed Wednesday to build an
intelligence unit within the proposed Cabinet agency.</LD>
<LD>   And in another move to expand on the Bush blueprint, the
Democratic chairman and the ranking Republican on the Senate
Judiciary Committee also were seeking to include the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a law
enforcement agency with expertise in bombs and other weaponry.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Democrats and Republicans also agreed on a measure to amend
a federal public record law in an effort to encourage private
industry to disclose to the government sensitive information about
vulnerabilities, threats and attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate committee's wheeling and dealing on homeland security
came as the House prepared to consider the bill today, with a vote
expected Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Bush met for the second consecutive day with
members of both parties, pressing his argument that the new
department should be given significant authority to shift funds and
manage personnel outside normal government rules.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about an incredibly important piece of
legislation," Bush said during a photo session at the end of one
meeting. "It's really a piece of legislation to make America a safer
place."</TE>
<TE>   The president expressed optimism that "we're going to get a good
bill on Friday out of the House," and he asked the Senate to finish
work on its version next week before beginning a summer break.</TE>
<TE>   On both sides of the Capitol, lawmakers intensified efforts to
craft legislation that would implement the most significant executive
reorganization in more than 50 years. It would result in a department
with more than 160,000 employees now scattered among 22 agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Most lawmakers appear to agree with the White House that the new
department should include the Coast Guard, the Customs Service and
the Transportation Security Administration, among other agencies. But
many details about the department's size and management remain
unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Pasadena), who met this week with Bush,
said most lawmakers want to back the president. But, he added, "I
want to make sure we get it right."</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of its debate, House leaders sought to winnow down 102
proposed amendments to a 232-page bill that largely tracks the Bush
plan.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, the Governmental Affairs Committee worked
throughout the day on a 273-page draft prepared by Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.), the chairman. It is expected to approve a bill
today. If approved, the bill would go to the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bush's plan, the new department would be organized into four
units, including one charged with safeguarding major public and
private assets. Within that unit, Bush proposes an "intelligence
analysis center" to collect information from various agencies and
assess threats and weak points.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the committee's ranking
Republican, defended the president's plan, saying that broader
intelligence reforms should wait until Congress has completed a
wide-ranging review of the FBI, the CIA and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, however, is seeking to elevate and expand the analysis
center. He would create a "directorate of intelligence" reporting to
the homeland security secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The committee approved a plan by Lieberman and Sen. Daniel K.
Akaka (D-Hawaii) to make the directorate "a national-level focal
point for information relating to the plans, intentions and
capabilities of terrorists and terrorist organizations." The
directorate, though it would have lesser powers than Lieberman
envisioned, would "communicate, coordinate and cooperate" with the
FBI and the intelligence community.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also approved a proposal brokered by Sens. Robert F.
Bennett (R-Utah), Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.)
to create an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   Under this proposal, certain records that private industry
voluntarily supplies to the Department of Homeland Security would be
shielded from public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy also teamed with the top Republican on the Judiciary
Committee, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, on a plan to beef up the new
department's law enforcement powers. They proposed Tuesday to move
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to the Department of
Homeland Security. Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) won approval Wednesday
from the Governmental Affairs Committee to bring the Federal Law
Enforcement Training Center, now in the Treasury Department, into the
new agency.</TE>

Wednesday night by an overwhelming vote of his colleagues in the
House of Representatives, becoming only the second member of Congress
thrown out by his peers since the Civil War.</LD>
<LD>   The 420-1 vote, with nine members recorded as "present," came
after the congressman made a last stand on the House floor. Four
members, Traficant among them, did not vote.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant, the self-dubbed "junkyard dog," has been a convicted
felon since April, when a jury in Cleveland found him guilty on all
10 counts of a federal corruption indictment. He protested his
innocence Wednesday night as people packed the House gallery hallways
for a turn to see him in action. His fellow lawmakers listened in
stony silence.</LD>
<TE>   The nine-term congressman from Youngstown offered a passionate
defense over 48 minutes, including 18 minutes granted him by other
House members. His plea not to be expelled was made in intervals,
broken up by arguments for his ouster by his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us ever want to sit in judgment of our peers," said Rep.
Joel Hefley (R-Colo.), chairman of the House ethics committee, which
unanimously recommended Traficant's expulsion. "There are some unique
occasions, however, when the behavior of an elected official violates
the public trust to such an extent that we are called upon to uphold
this provision."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), another member of the ethics panel,
said: "He traded his official office and powers repeatedly for money,
for labor, for equipment at his farm and other things."</TE>
<TE>   The ethics committee's senior Democrat, Rep. Howard L. Berman of
Mission Hills, called the evidence against Traficant "vast" and
warned that allowing him to retain his membership in the House
"cannot be our message."</TE>
<TE>   To make his case on the House floor Wednesday evening, Traficant
offered a winding exposition of his criminal trial and insisted once
again that he has long been "the No. 1 target of the United States
justice system."</TE>
<TE>   At times hard to follow, Traficant, 61, spoke about a long cast of
shady characters from his trial and professed his conviction that
former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno was a "traitor" and his belief that
he has suffered lingering repercussions for standing up for John
Demjanjuk, who had been accused of being the Nazi war criminal "Ivan
the Terrible."</TE>
<TE>   But he also exhibited the spark that made his one-minute speeches
from the floor famous among avid C-SPAN followers--shouting,
gesticulating and sprinkling his comments with words such as "damn"
that earned him several admonishments from the House leadership,
which had taken five minutes at the start of the proceedings to offer
cautions about decorum.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of his promised denim suit with bell-bottom pants,
Traficant was dressed in a dark, boot-leg-cut suit with an overly
long tie that had sedate diagonal stripes. It seemed for a short time
that Traficant, who has made a career of being the underdog, might
have one more political life in him yet.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the ethics committee hearing last week, a juror in
Traficant's federal corruption trial said he might have had
reasonable doubt about the congressman's guilt if he had heard the
testimony of Richard Detore, one of Traficant's witnesses at the
hearing, during the criminal trial.</TE>
<TE>   The juror, Leo Moser, cautioned in interviews that he was not
saying for certain that his guilty decision would have shifted, and
he pointed out that Detore was not cross-examined by federal
prosecutors. Nonetheless, he said, the new testimony raised
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Detore, a co-defendant of Traficant's who is currently under
indictment, told the House ethics committee that the federal
prosecutor had threatened him and encouraged him to lie to bolster
the government's case against Traficant.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations about prosecutorial misconduct were forwarded for
investigation to the Justice Department by Rep. Ted Strickland
(D-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   The vote on Traficant's ouster came only after an attempt by Rep.
Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio), another ethics committee member, to
delay the proceedings until the House returns in September from the
monthlong August recess.</TE>
<TE>   The motion was defeated, 281 to 145, after LaTourette and others
rose to ask colleagues to wait until after Traficant's sentencing
next week and until questions raised by Detore were resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant was convicted in April on charges that he had traded
political favors for money, received kickbacks from congressional
staffers, evaded taxes and made his staff shovel horse manure and do
other tasks on government time at his Ohio farm.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, who often reminds people that he is "just the son of a
truck driver," made his political career as David to the government's
Goliath. He was elected sheriff in his native Mahoning County, Ohio,
in the 1970s, and was indicted in 1983 on federal charges that he had
taken money from organized-crime figures in Youngstown.</TE>
<TE>   Although caught on tape dealing with mobsters, Traficant
successfully defended himself in court despite lacking a law degree.
He told the jury he had been conducting his own sting but was later
forced to pay stiff tax penalties after failing to produce the cash.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant brought up his 1983 court victory Wednesday as evidence
of the government's motivation for pursuing what he says was a
20-year vendetta against him.</TE>
<TE>   Berman told the House that to believe Traficant's defense would be
to buy into a "vast conspiracy--including not only unsavory and
disreputable characters from Youngstown but the FBI, the IRS, a
well-respected federal judge--that was engineered by Janet Reno and
implemented by John Ashcroft."</TE>
<TE>   In his final moments on the floor, Traficant said that while
Congress might have the right to throw him out, "my people didn't
want me out." He has vowed to run again as an independent--from
prison, if necessary. He warned his colleagues that the American
people had grown fearful of their government and laid the blame at
their feet.</TE>
<TE>   "As a member of Congress, I want [you] to think of this: There may
come a day when you are targeted," he said as he was warned his time
had run out. And he made one final appeal: "I am asking for your
vote."</TE>
<TE>   Only one member heeded his plea, Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres),
who admitted a "close friendship" with Chandra Levy, a constituent
who disappeared at the end of a Washington internship and whose
skeletal remains were not found until May, a year after her
disappearance. Condit's bid for reelection failed in the primary this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant is only the fifth member in the 213-year history of the
House to be expelled by peers.</TE>
<TE>   After voting to expel Traficant, House members resumed legislative
business.</TE>

<HD>Home-Buying Trust Funds for Poor Called Big Success</HD>
<DH>Community: Treasuries for affordable housing have grown
fourfold since 1990, group says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of affordable-housing trust funds across the nation has
more than quadrupled since 1990, evidence of how useful the funds
have proved to be to communities struggling to provide housing for
the poor, a housing advocacy group reported this week.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington, D.C.-based Center for Community Change is trying
to keep the trend alive--arguing that the federal government, states
and cities should build special treasuries to subsidize housing.</LD>
<LD>   A housing trust fund receives public funds from a dedicated
source, money that can be tapped to construct and rehabilitate
housing for low-income residents or to subsidize homeownership.</LD>
<TE>   According to the report, the nation's 282 city, county and state
funds provide about $750 million each year to support low-income
housing. In 2001, the nation's trust funds supported 65,000 units of
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the report and other housing advocates say the
findings buttress their call for the federal government to establish
a similar fund.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly a national housing crisis and it requires a truly
national response,'' said Jerry Jones, policy analyst for the Center
for Community Change, a nonprofit that assists organizations working
in low-income communities.</TE>
<TE>   Like local funds, a national housing trust fund would supply a
constant source of money not subject to annual budget battles. The
idea has won support among some legislators, including Rep. Maxine
Waters (D-Los Angeles), co-author of the National Affordable Housing
Fund Act.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an acute housing shortage, particularly of affordable
housing,'' Waters said.</TE>
<TE>   The act, co-written by Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), would have
created a national fund using more than $26 billion in surplus funds
generated by the Federal Housing Administration, but the proposal
died in committee this month.</TE>
<TE>   The House Financial Services Committee approved a compromise
proposal that calls for federal matching grants for city, county and
state trust funds.</TE>
<TE>   Republican leaders and the Bush administration oppose the idea of
dedicating a separate source of funds solely for affordable housing,
but some legislators said they would consider the compromise to add
money to local housing funds.</TE>
<TE>   That would be at least a step toward more sustained funding,
advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   "[It's] not everything we wanted, but it's something we didn't
have a shot at a year ago,'' said David Swanson of the Assn. of
Community Organizations for Reform Now.</TE>
<TE>   California has more housing trust funds than any other state, and
Los Angeles has pledged to build the largest fund, at $100 million.
Federal support would make that pot even larger, Swanson said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is expected to take up the issue in September.</TE>
<TE>   At a rally Wednesday in Los Angeles, tenants stood outside a
building owned by the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development and said federal funding is badly needed.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Miranda, who has lived in the dilapidated building on Grand
Avenue for eight years, said tenants have put up with absentee
owners, mold, leaks and other problems. "We're asking that they
approve a federal fund," Miranda said, "for buildings like this."</TE>

<HD>Wooten Breaks Out in Big Way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Wooten of the Angels was not in the lineup against the Oakland
Athletics on Wednesday night, but he still enjoyed his 30th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Wooten had ended an 0-for-18 skid the night before with three
hits, two against Oakland left-hander Barry Zito and one against
right-hander Jim Mecir.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first three-hit game of the season for Wooten, who
missed the first 86 games after undergoing surgery to repair torn
ligaments in his right thumb. Wooten was activated from the disabled
list July 11.</LD>
<TE>   "It's almost like I'm still in spring training," said Wooten, who
is seven for 26 with a home run and four runs batted in. "I'm still
working to get good swings on the ball. I haven't really done that
except for [Tuesday] night."</TE>
<TE>   Wooten said his thumb feels fine but that he is still working to
strengthen his wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned 30 and it's beginning to feel like it," he said. "I
remember when I was 21. Surgery? I'll be back in a week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival will pitch a simulated game today and is
expected to be activated from the disabled list on Saturday at
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly's recent success in a set-up role leaves the
Angels with some tough decisions about whose roster spot Percival
will fill.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly, a 31-year-old rookie, has given up one hit and recorded
11 strikeouts in six innings of scoreless relief since he was
recalled from triple-A Salt Lake on July 13. He worked two shutout
innings Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm throwing my slider more and locking in on every pitch," said
Donnelly, who signed his first pro contract in 1992 and played in six
organizations and with two independent teams before signing with the
Angels last season. "I've been fortunate to get some opportunities
and I've come through. That's what's important to your teammates."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman said he is not surprised by
the performance of Donnelly, Scot Shields and Scott Schoeneweis in
the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   He also said their recent outstanding performances against Seattle
and Oakland would not necessarily stop the Angels from seeking help
through a trade.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always trying to upgrade," Stoneman said. "If we can do
something bullpen related or with another position that is going to
help us, we're going to look at it."</TE>

<HD>Dreifort Has Bursitis in Right Knee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>An MRI test on pitcher Darren Dreifort's right knee Wednesday was
inconclusive, and after being examined by Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger team
physician, the right-hander was diagnosed with bursitis.</LD>
<LD>   Dreifort, who has undergone two arthroscopic operations on his
right knee and is rehabilitating from major elbow surgery, received a
cortisone shot Wednesday, and he will resume throwing lightly in the
bullpen Friday.</LD>
<LD>   If Dreifort doesn't feel any discomfort, Dodger trainer Stan
Johnston said he will able to resume throwing simulated games, the
final step before going on a minor league rehabilitation assignment.</LD>
<TE>   "This isn't really good news--we wish it didn't happen," Johnston
said. "But this is a pretty small problem."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, recovering from June 11 surgery for a herniated disk
in his lower back, threw 61 pitches in the Dodger Stadium bullpen
Wednesday and will throw again in the bullpen Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Odalis Perez received permission from the Dodgers to
travel home to the Dominican Republic to tend to a family matter, and
the left-hander will rejoin the team Tuesday in Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Perez's absence will not affect the Dodger rotation, though,
because the team had planned to use off days today and Monday to skip
Perez's next start, giving the fatigued pitcher nine days before his
next game against the Reds next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   One condition of granting Perez a leave of absence was that he
complete two bullpen workouts at the Dodgers' academy in the
Dominican.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To clear room on their 25-man roster for newly acquired Tyler
Houston, the Dodgers are expected to designate reserve outfielder
Hiram Bocachica for assignment Friday, meaning recently recalled Mike
Kinkade will remain with the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers would have 10 days to either trade Bocachica, send him
to triple-A Las Vegas if he clears waivers, or release him. The
Detroit Tigers have expressed considerable interest in Bocachica, and
it's likely they will trade for him or claim him.</TE>
<TE>   Bocachica is hitting .215 with four homers and nine runs batted
in, but Kinkade, promoted from Las Vegas on Sunday, had two hits and
an RBI in his first start Monday night and has impressed the Dodgers
with his offensive approach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's trade for Houston, General Manager Dan Evans has
turned his attention to the bullpen. Toronto right-hander Kelvim
Escobar, who is 5-4 with a 4.69 earned-run average and 19 saves, was
at the top of the Dodgers' list, but the Blue Jays don't seem as
motivated to trade him as they do several other players.</TE>
<TE>   Evans has discussed possible trades for Pittsburgh left-hander
Scott Sauerbeck, who is 3-0 with a 2.33 ERA in 50 games and has
limited left-handers to a .148 average, and Cleveland left-hander
Ricardo Rincon, who is 1-4 with a 4.59 ERA in 43 games and has held
left-handers to a .230 average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek returned to the lineup Wednesday
after sitting out Tuesday night's game because of a strained lower
back. He went hitless in four at-bats but said he experienced no
tightness or stiffness in the back.... Padre starter Bobby Jones did
not walk a batter Wednesday, extending his string of consecutive
innings without a walk to 25 2/3.</TE>

<HD>The Necessity of Targeted Assassinations</HD>
<DH>The Israeli reply to terror is moral and appropriate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN R. DAVID</AU>
<BD>Steven R. David is a professor of international
relations and associate dean of academic affairs at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Israel's killing of Hamas leader Salah Shehada--and 14 Palestinian
civilians--has provoked a major international outcry. Even President
Bush, who usually supports Israeli actions, condemned the airstrike
as "heavy-handed."</LD>
<LD>   Although the Israelis erred in this instance by launching an
attack that killed so many innocents, it would be a mistake to
conclude that their policy of targeted killing is wrong. In fact,
targeted killing is a moral and appropriate response to the terror
launched against Israel by Palestinian leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Targeted killing is the Israeli policy of intentionally killing
individuals who are on their way to commit a terrorist attack or
those who are behind such attacks.</LD>
<TE>   It is not a new policy. Israel has pursued such attacks throughout
its history, even at one point attempting to kill Yasser Arafat--a
failure that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has publicly lamented.</TE>
<TE>   What is new is the scale of the attacks, which has grown since the
launching of the second intifada almost two years ago and the
increased use of sophisticated military weapons such as Apache
helicopters and F-16 jet fighters in the operations.</TE>
<TE>   There is much that is distasteful about targeted killings. They
provoke murderous retaliations, burn informers, create martyrs,
complicate peace negotiations, divert intelligence resources and
promote cooperation among Israel's enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals are killed without due process. Most important, there
is no compelling evidence that they are effective in reducing
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   A record number of Israeli civilians have become victims of
terrorist attacks at the same time that targeted killings have
reached their peak.</TE>
<TE>   So how can such a policy be justified?</TE>
<TE>   Targeted killings make three important contributions to Israeli
security. First, by keeping terrorists on the run and gradually
eliminating some of the skilled operatives, Israel hopes to
eventually reduce the terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   As bad as things are now, they may have been even worse, or would
get worse in the future, without the policy of targeted killing.</TE>
<TE>   Second, when targeted killing works, the only one killed is the
perpetrator (or backer) of the terrorist act. This is far better than
major military sweeps that kill and injure countless innocents.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, targeted killing provides a sense of revenge and
retribution for the Israeli public, which understandably demands a
response to terrorism. No Israeli government could survive
Palestinian terrorist attacks without a forceful response.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the Palestinian Authority is unwilling or unable to
curb those who deliberately seek to kill innocent Israelis and bring
these attackers to justice, it is up to Israel to do so. Targeted
killing does this, and at a cost that is far less harmful to the
Palestinians than its alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Targeted killing will not bring peace to the Middle East. Only a
political solution that calls for an independent Palestinian state
can do that.</TE>
<TE>   A policy of targeted killing also must carry with it adequate
safeguards, including civilian oversight. Targeted killing must focus
only on combatants. Political leaders, no matter how odious, must be
spared. And targeted killing cannot be carried out forever. It is a
policy that makes sense only during war or armed conflict. Once a
peace settlement is reached, it must end.</TE>
<TE>   For a region going through a horrendous time, targeted killing is
the worst possible policy--except for all the others.</TE>

<HD>Get Used to It: Our Airports Are Vulnerable to Terrorism</HD>
<DH>We can lessen but not eliminate the risk of attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN MICHAEL JENKINS</AU>
<BD>Brian Michael Jenkins is a senior advisor to the
president of the Rand Corp., a nonprofit policy research and analysis
institution that has been studying terrorism for more than 30 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As we contemplate new measures to expand airport security, we need to
keep in mind some unfortunate realities made clear by the July 4
shootings at Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   First reality: It is very hard to protect public places. Doing so
is costly and disruptive and creates new vulnerabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Second reality: It is a mistake to create expectations about
invulnerability that cannot be fulfilled. We could never make all
locations invulnerable to attack. A determined killer could always
move down the road to other public places.</LD>
<TE>   We must make a distinction between security at airports and
security for airports. There is justification to take extraordinary
security measures at airports, but the calculations change when we
talk about security for airports.</TE>
<TE>   What we have now is security at airports deployed to keep weapons
off airplanes. We do this because terrorists have focused their
attacks on commercial airliners as national symbols. Airline sabotage
can claim the lives of hundreds of passengers in a single incident.
And, as we saw on Sept. 11, a hijacked plane can be turned into a
missile that can kill thousands in a city below.</TE>
<TE>   But the airport terminal itself is public space. Outside of the
screening points, it is no safer or no more dangerous than most other
public spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Where do we draw the line? The government has publicized possible
terrorist threats to national monuments, nuclear reactors, surface
transportation, ports, power plants, bridges, high-rise buildings,
movie studios, sports arenas, shopping malls and public celebrations.
Can we protect them all? And would even extreme measures stop
attackers from taking innocent lives? A determined killer will always
find a target. Someone determined to kill Jews will find it no more
difficult than killing Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus or
members of any other religious, ethnic or national group.</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone really believe that if airport security had been
tighter, the shooter at LAX would have traded his pistols for a
picket sign and protested peacefully against Israel?</TE>
<TE>   Security at Israel's main airport has been tight ever since May
1972, when three members of the Japanese Red Army--which had allied
itself with the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine--attacked arriving passengers. Even Israeli officials
concede the difficulties of preventing attacks like the one at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Because Israel's Ben Gurion Airport is surrounded by rings of
security, suicide attackers instead target bus stops, shopping malls,
hotel lobbies and pizza parlors. The horror of these murders is not
lessened by their distance from the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Better security for airports is no small undertaking. The
deployment of even a few additional armed uniformed and undercover
officers at every terminal in every airport easily would involve
thousands of new security personnel. Shifting the screening
checkpoints to the front of the terminal would simply create long
lines of passengers on the sidewalks outside--a new vulnerability and
a tempting target for killers.</TE>
<TE>   The question is not whether we can increase security for any
category of public real estate. If we are willing to make the
necessary investment and accept the added inconvenience, we can make
it more difficult (but by no means impossible) to carry out an act of
violence inside wherever we establish the perimeter. The question is:
How can we best allocate limited resources to reduce dangers to
public safety overall?</TE>
<TE>   All this doesn't mean we should do nothing more at our airports.
We can on a random basis deploy additional police without pretending
to provide full coverage. We can deploy additional surveillance
cameras. And we can increase the efficiency of the check-in and
screening process to move passengers into the secure zone more
quickly, thus reducing crowds and individual exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Existing proposals to remodel airports or disperse check-in
facilities to satellite terminals will provide valuable opportunities
to explore new security protocols, but these are long-term
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   With hard work, good luck and clever strategies we may be able to
come close to abolishing murder in the skies. But no society in
history has been able to abolish murder here on Earth, and none ever
will. Unfortunately, there is no security device that can X-ray
people's souls to identify the killers among us.</TE>

<AU>DAVID MARTIN</AU>
<BD>David Martin is an Ottawa attorney and contributor to
"101 Damnations: The Humorists' Tour of Personal Hells" (St. Martin's
Press, due in August).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Greenspan takes pleasure in answering the communication below,
expressing at the same time his great gratification that its faithful
author is numbered among the friends of the Fed:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Dear Mr. Greenspan:</LD>
<TE>   I am 78 years old. Some of my friends say there is no stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter says, "If you hear it from the Fed, it's so." Please
tell me the truth, is there a stock market?</TE>
<TE>   Virginia O'Hanlon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Virginia, your friends are wrong. They have been affected by the
skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they
realize in net taxable gains. They think that nothing can be which is
not cash or actual dividends. All minds, Virginia, whether they be
bears' or bulls', are little. In this great universe of ours,
regulators and politicians are mere insects in their intellects as
compared with the boundless world about them, as measured by the
weighted average that is the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Virginia, there is a stock market. It exists as certainly as
options, futures and preferred dividends exist, and you know that
they abound and give to your portfolio its highest growth and return.</TE>
<TE>   Alas! How dreary would be the world if there were no stock market!
It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be
no brokers, no analysts, no auditors to make tolerable this
existence. We should have no irrational buying or panic selling. The
infectious greed with which investors fill the world would be
extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   Not believe in the stock market! You might as well not believe in
strip bonds or convertible debentures. You might get your daughter to
hire men to watch on all the trading floors in all the exchanges
throughout the world to catch Russell or Dow Jones or Standard &amp;
Poor's, but even if you did not see them, what would that prove?
Nobody sees paper profit, but that is no sign that there is no stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   The most real things in the world are those that neither children
nor men can see. Did you ever see capital gains or unexercised stock
options? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there.
Nobody can conceive or imagine all the financial wonders there are
unseen and unrealized in the world.</TE>
<TE>   You tear apart the cell phone and see what makes the noise inside,
but there is a veil covering the financial world which not the
strongest regulator, nor even the united strength of all the
strongest regulators that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith,
greed and irrational exuberance can push aside that curtain and view
and picture the fiscal beauty and glory beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing
else real and abiding.</TE>
<TE>   No stock market! Thank God! It lives and lives forever. A thousand
points from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 points from now, it
will continue to make glad the heart of investors.</TE>

<HD>We Want It Bigger, Better and With an Attitude</HD>
<DH>The Twin Towers said something, and so should a

<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So far nobody--except perhaps the designers--seems particularly
pleased by the six proposals for rebuilding Lower Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   The plans were unveiled last week in anticipation of the one-year
anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Organizers had hoped
to announce by now the designs for several smaller buildings and
possibly a park on the site where the World Trade Center stood, but
the half-dozen sketches on the table have elicited so many boos and
Bronx cheers from scoffing Gothamites that the project's overseers
were forced to slink back to the drawing board in demi-disgrace.</LD>
<LD>   It's a little embarrassing, actually. Some of the wittier 5,000
New York City residents who were assembled at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center last week to offer comments and suggestions about
the project rightly quipped that, if realized, any of the feeble
proposed designs would make downtown look like Albany--an insult
whose asperity you probably have to be a New Yorker to fully
appreciate. And it's true. The offered designs are diminutive and
cowering, lackluster and formulaic, not worthy of the Big Apple, not
fitting additions to its once awesome, now rendingly diminished,
skyline.</LD>
<TE>   Size matters. So does panache. We need buildings with attitude.
Nothing else will do, and it's not just because we care about how our
ragged gash of cityscape looks as you're coming over the Triborough
or the Brooklyn or the Queensboro Bridge. It's because it matters how
the sight of it makes us feel about what Leonard Bernstein called our
wonderful town.</TE>
<TE>   For native New Yorkers and pilgrims alike, there have been few
things more heartbreaking about the protracted aftermath of Sept. 11
than the garish gap in the city's famous profile, that blank, vacuous
space on the horizon where the World Trade Center once so
impressively stood.</TE>
<TE>   Healing our pain will take more than plastering up some
nondescript heap of pedestrian office space that meets the required
quota of square footage but wouldn't even inspire a flock of pigeons
to deface it.</TE>
<TE>   Our dead, as much as we honor and ache for them, do not need a
valedictory park, or another Vietnam Memorial for tourists to sniffle
and gawk at. Survivors of those who died, to whose suffering we are
little more than absurd spectators, deserve a tasteful, sublime and
enduring testament to their loss. We, the living, must move forward
with our heads held high, not hanging in fetishized grief. We cannot
stand any longer, as some of us have done, like overgrown children
amid the ruins of our sandcastle, beating our foreheads first in
naive disbelief, now in victimized self-satisfaction. Neither is a
becoming posture to pin a monument on.</TE>
<TE>   Are we what our enemies would have us be: Sodom on its knees? Or
are we the vibrant, thriving capital of the free world, the untoppled
colossus of culture and commerce that has inspired poets, novelists,
composers, filmmakers and creative minds of every calling to enshrine
our greatest city in their art for some 200 years?</TE>
<TE>   "And Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced / As though the sun
took step of thee, yet left / Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,
-- / Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!"</TE>
<TE>   The American poet Hart Crane wrote those words about the Brooklyn
Bridge, and they should apply to whatever we plant at ground zero.
Those who died there would, no doubt, have wanted it that way.
Anything less would be a disservice to their memory.</TE>

<LD>If the state Air Resources Board and the nation's auto makers do
their jobs right, the cars and sport-utility vehicles that Americans
drive 10 years from now will be better, smarter, safer and more
fuel-efficient than today's models. They will not be much more
expensive. And they will make a significant contribution to the
nascent battle against global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The auto industry and its allies spent $5 million in a
sky-is-falling campaign against Assembly Bill 1493, by Assemblywoman
Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), which requires the Air Resources Board
to set limits on car and truck emissions of greenhouse gases,
primarily carbon dioxide, for the first time. The bill passed the
Legislature narrowly and was signed into law Monday by Gov. Gray
Davis in dual ceremonies in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It sets up
the first significant U.S. program specifically aimed at emissions
that contribute to global warming.</LD>
<LD>   Auto makers tried everything to thwart it. They pooh-poohed the
dangers of global warming. They claimed that SUVs and pickup trucks
would be replaced by flimsy little vehicles that would endanger
soccer moms and their kids. Bureaucrats would design your car and
tell you what you could or could not buy.</LD>
<TE>   Davis was correct when he said, "We're merely asking business to
do what business does best: innovate, compete, find solutions to
problems and do it in a way that strengthens the economy."</TE>
<TE>   The technology needed to meet new standards is available today.
Some of it is in use in Europe, Japan and, to a limited degree, the
United States. Advances include more efficient transmissions,
smoother-rolling tires, tighter seals on air conditioners, better
valve exhaust systems and better aerodynamics. High-mileage autos
using both gasoline and electricity are already on the road.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry need not be limited to existing technology.
Whatever happened to American inventiveness? If we can build a
stealth bomber of new composite materials, why can't Detroit come up
with new alloys or synthetics that would make vehicles lighter but
stronger and safer? If we could walk on the moon 33 years ago why
can't we build a car or pickup that meets our present needs?</TE>
<TE>   One Silicon Valley executive says AB 1493 is just what the
high-tech industry needs to boost the economy. If computer whizzes
can revolutionize their industry every few years, why does the
internal combustion engine have the same basic design it had a
century ago?</TE>
<TE>   The industry has until the 2009 model year to produce vehicles
that respond to new standards. This nation went from Alan Shepard's
primitive 15-minute skimming of outer space to the landing of Apollo
11's Eagle on the moon in little more time than that.</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Airstrike Disaster</HD>

<LD>Israeli civilians will suffer most from their leaders' recklessness
in using a 2,000-pound bomb in crowded Gaza City to kill one
terrorist leader. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's incredible claim that
the raid early Wednesday was "one of our biggest successes," despite
the deaths of nine children and five adults in addition to the
intended target, was beyond the pale. In reality, the assault was a
military disaster, guaranteed to create more Palestinian suicide
bombers.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials later said they would investigate the failure of
military intelligence to predict the civilian carnage in a dense
apartment area typical of Gaza. They also pledged to withdraw troops
from some West Bank cities. As befits a democracy, there was strong
criticism of the action from within the country, with an Israeli
human rights group accusing the government of adopting the terrorist
tactics it abhors in its enemies. That public debate is part of the
strength of a nation that now has the difficult job of guarding
against retaliatory attacks, stopping more self- inflicted disasters
and deciding how to withdraw its troops from the occupied
territories, where the Israeli presence inflames Palestinian rage and
weakens Israel's security.</LD>
<TE>   The army claims its intelligence indicated that Salah Shehada, a
senior leader of Hamas' military wing, would be alone with an
associate in a building. But his wife and a daughter were there too,
and they were killed along with Shehada and his aide. Israeli
security forces had long pursued the Hamas official, whom they
accused of masterminding numerous suicide bombings against Israeli
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the Israeli air force struck because Shehada was
about to launch more attacks. Yet, hours before the strike, a senior
Hamas leader had said the group would consider ending suicide attacks
if Israel would withdraw from West Bank cities, where for weeks it
has kept Palestinians penned in their homes with nearly
around-the-clock curfews. After the bombing, a Hamas military leader
said there would be retaliation "until the Jews see pieces of bodies
in each restaurant, in their bars, their buses, on their streets."</TE>
<TE>   The timing of Wednesday's strike feels uncomfortably like a
deliberate sabotage of truce feelers. Before the bombing, there were
a number of promising signs of relaxation in tensions. Palestinian
and Israeli government ministers last weekend discussed the
possibility of a phased withdrawal of troops from occupied
territories, and one organization that has used suicide bombers said
it would stop attacks against civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which criticizes Israel seldom and
usually only faintly, toughened its language. Spokesman Ari Fleischer
denounced the strike, saying Israel knew that innocents would be
killed. Sweden labeled it "a crime against international law and
morally unworthy of a democracy like Israel." Israel's moral high
ground was built on its delineation between combatants and civilians
in a difficult war against terrorists who have no scruples. The
bombing was a slip over the edge.</TE>

<HD>Swiss-Made Neutrality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American mind--or many American minds anyway--contains lots of
spotty information about Switzerland. Let's remedy that.</LD>
<LD>   First, the country's name is really the Swiss Confederation. Heidi
lives there, of course. So do grown men in shorts blowing long horns
on grassy mountainsides. The Swiss used to make the world's only
quality watches. Never mind all the cheese, the Swiss still forge
chocolate to die for, cough drops with that funny name and ingenious
pocket knives you can't carry onto airplanes anymore. Switzerland
also guards the pope and offers numbered bank accounts for really
rich people who might need to leave another country quickly.</LD>
<LD>   One thing everyone pretty much understands is that Switzerland is
neutral. The Swiss are extremist neutrals. Neutral about almost
everything anyone could disagree about except Swiss neutrality. No
neutrality on neutrality. So it's a historic moment now that--after
354 years of very official neutrality, two generations of debate and
a national referendum--Switzerland, or rather the Swiss
Confederation, has quietly decided to stop being neutral about the
United Nations and take the bold step of joining an organization that
isn't always neutral.</LD>
<TE>   In September, Switzerland (and East Timor) will up United Nations
membership to 191 nations. This won't set off widespread yodeling.
Truth is, it's long seemed that much of the U.N. is already in
Geneva. Indeed, 19 intergovernmental organizations, including nine
U.N. bodies, call Switzerland home, as do 170 nongovernmental
organizations like the Red Cross and the Olympics. There's something
about being landlocked astride historical transportation and invasion
routes and mountain passes that spawns a
let's-get-along-and-avoid-others'-fights vision, a sometimes dicey
but often profitable position.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the cultural, religious and linguistic diversity (65%
speak German, 20% French and 10% Italian) in a country half the size
of Maine, the Swiss get along--with their neighbors and with each
other. Who's got much bad to say about a neutral country that
invented Alpine beauty, owns the Matterhorn and runs all-electric
trains on time?</TE>
<TE>   The problem with Switzerland is its 10,000 annual avalanches,
forecast on the radio like weather or traffic reports. But those
massive snow slides (the thick forests above Swiss villages are not
there by accident) are probably caused by French skiers anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a diverse democracy that works, where voters get along.
We're not neutral about that. Thank goodness Switzerland is bringing
this approach into full U.N. membership. Maybe some Swiss ways will
rub off.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A partisan standoff over a new state budget is set to claim a fresh
round of victims: the lawmakers who can't agree on the spending
package.</LD>
<LD>   Although most of the state's 250,000 employees will receive their
first paychecks of the new fiscal year Tuesday, state Controller
Kathleen Connell said she does not plan to pay elected officials,
including herself, Gov. Gray Davis and state legislators.</LD>
<LD>   Connell also said she won't dole out per diem payments to
lawmakers or reimburse them or other state employees for travel
expenses. It is common for most of California's 120 legislators to
make weekly trips between Sacramento and their home districts.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to put a little pain over in the Capitol," Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   A $99-billion spending plan cleared the state Senate last month,
but it remains mired in the Assembly. Four Republican votes are
needed to pass the budget, but the GOP lawmakers are holding out
because they object to nearly $4 billion in new taxes and other new
revenue included in the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff caused Gov. Gray Davis to miss signing a budget by
the July 1 deadline, the start of the new fiscal year. He is trying
to persuade the minimum four Republicans to vote for the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Connell said Wednesday that she thinks Davis needs to meet with
legislative leaders from both houses to work out a deal, warning that
California is headed toward a "danger zone." If the state does not
have a new budget in place by mid-August, she said, it could
complicate her ability to borrow billions of dollars needed to keep
California's finances running smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Other victims of the battle are about 2,400 legislative employees,
who first missed their paychecks July 15 and are set to miss another
round Tuesday. Connell said she also plans not to pay 376 appointed
executive officers, constitutional officers and Cabinet members.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, bills from vendors who do business with the state,
such as providing food services to hospitals and prisons, will go
unpaid until a budget is approved.</TE>

<HD>After Taking a Beating, Simon Cuts His Losses Like Many
Investors</HD>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   The lights burned late at Kinko's. OK, so Kinko's is hardly
historic and hallowed--not like the White House or even the
governor's office. But Sunday night, it was the ideal meeting place
for Bill Simon's strategists.</LD>
<LD>   Simon had given the "go." Roll the copy machines.</LD>
<TE>   Crank out 20 sets of Simon income tax returns, 11 years'
worth--each set roughly 1,300 pages, bound in two volumes the size of
city phone books.</TE>
<TE>   Crank 'em out for nine hours, until 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Here reporters, you want these "released"--you got 'em. For two
hours only. And they must stay in the room. Just one reporter per
newspaper. No help from any private accountant. Write on only the
notepads we supply.</TE>
<TE>   A very clumsy "release," creating more bad press for the
Republican gubernatorial candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Two visions came to mind.</TE>
<TE>   First from the written Simon announcement, which began: "Copies of
Mr. Simon's tax returns will be available for reporters to view...."
I envisioned being invited to a visitation of the campaign corpse.
This campaign, after all, has been in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   The second vision was a nightmare from the past: sitting in a
school library, head in some nonsensical textbook, taking laborious
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, the restrictions almost immediately were eased, contrary
to news reports.</TE>
<TE>   The one-reporter limit was dropped. Reporters were given all the
time they needed. In fact, I'm told the returns will be available
throughout the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The notepad rule was aimed at keeping us from copying Simon's
figures onto blank tax forms. Maybe they'd get peddled later as the
originals.</TE>
<TE>   The stay-in-the-room rule is in line with how previous rich
candidates have released their tax returns--candidates like Democrats
Al Checchi and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. They basically agreed with
Simon chief strategist Sal Russo, who told reporters Monday: "I don't
think you'd want your taxes flying around on the Internet or hanging
out on street corners."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the tired argument goes, but I'm not running for governor....
Voters need to know whether a candidate has paid his fair share.</TE>
<TE>   As I opined three months ago, judging "fair share" is the role of
the Internal Revenue Service and Franchise Tax Board. A person's tax
return--even a politician's-- should be solely the business of the
taxpayer and tax collector. Or a lender or a court.</TE>
<TE>   Next thing, political opponents and the news media will be
demanding that a candidate release his school grades. Disclose
whether he has any congenital disease. Report the miles per gallon of
his vehicles. Aren't these facts necessary to determine ability and
attitude?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the public can learn a lot about a politician's
investments and potential conflicts from his required statements of
economic interest.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there has been nothing to pop up yet in Simon's personal
tax returns that appears damaging. His tax damage comes from other
sources:</TE>
<TE>   * The IRS recently fingered Simon as one of several businessmen
who have used offshore tax shelters it suspects may be illegal. That
rare disclosure was "inexcusable," the IRS and U.S. Treasury
Department since have admitted.</TE>
<TE>   * Gov. Gray Davis Wednesday began running a TV ad that claims
Simon "siphoned excessive [management] fees" from the family's
nonprofit charitable foundation. This information came from a San
Francisco Chronicle report, which was based on readily available
public records required of nonprofits.</TE>
<TE>   So the release of personal tax returns is more about playing
political defense than disclosing useful information.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis and Simon are throwing dirt bombs in an increasingly
nasty political game. And as I noted last week, this is not a
climate--amid corporate scandals, collapsing stock market, Simon
shelters--that is hospitable to a businessman-investor standing on
the principle of "personal privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Simon could passionately articulate that principle, which
he never did.</TE>
<TE>   And so Sunday morning, Russo phoned Simon and advised that
he--like millions of stockholders--cut his losses. Let go of those
returns. Client didn't argue with consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Call Kinko's. They've got binding machines. Open 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Go at night to guard against any pesky civilians filching
documents. Russo personally oversees the copying. "I'm the only one
who had seen them, and I felt a duty to protect their integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Politically, he adds, "maybe now we can go back to where we were
before this disruption. Back to talking about the economy, education
and quality of life--water, power, roads."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. Hopefully.</TE>
<TE>   And we should all listen. But Simon will need to say
something--with passion and conviction--worth hearing and
remembering. Worth copying down.</TE>

<HD>James Doolin, 70; Evocative Urban Painter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Doolin, a realist painter whose technical skill and keenly
observed interpretations of the world around him are prized by a
broad audience, has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Doolin had suffered from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung
disease of uncertain origin, for several months and was hospitalized
at UCLA Medical Center at the time of his death Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A master of color and composition, Doolin sometimes said he was
more interested in visual images than in social content. But his
evocative, moody paintings teemed with life as he found it on the
streets of Los Angeles, at the casinos of Las Vegas and in the
deserts of Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   "What I've always wanted to do," he told a Times reporter in 1999,
was "to look at things in a transcendent way and find what I feel, be
it beautiful or scary."</TE>
<TE>   In a review of "Some Los Angeles Icons," an exhibition of Doolin's
paintings two years ago at the Koplin Gallery in West Hollywood,
Times art critic Christopher Knight praised the artist's "gift for
endowing the everyday with a sense of estrangement." Doolin's urban
paintings "stop in its tracks the steady freeway flow or
ever-changing landscapes of billboards, rendering them mysterious and
spectral," Knight wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Writers also have been impressed with Doolin's ability to turn
fleeting visual experiences into graphic drama. One of his best-known
works, "East Wind," a 1991 freeway scene made ominous by gale force
winds, is reproduced on the cover of Mike Davis' darkly prophetic
book, "Ecology of Fear."</TE>
<TE>   Australian writer Peter Carey, who met Doolin in Melbourne in 1966
and became a close friend of the artist, said he loved to accompany
Doolin because "he had a way of looking at the world that was
different from anyone else's, whether he was at an art museum or the
Mojave Desert."</TE>
<TE>   "He was also a risk-taker as an artist," Carey said, noting that
Doolin's choice of subject matter was often unfashionable.</TE>
<TE>   Working as a realist painter in an artistic climate ruled by
abstraction, conceptual art and electronic media didn't help Doolin
find a prominent place in museums and cutting-edge galleries, but he
tackled enormously demanding projects that won the admiration of his
peers and the public.</TE>
<TE>   "As Edward Hopper did in New York, [Doolin] captured both the
beauty and the alienation of our time in Los Angeles," said artist
Carl Cheng.</TE>
<TE>   "We have lost someone irreplaceable," said artist Michael C.
McMillen, another longtime friend of Doolin. "He revealed universal
truths in powerful paintings that are compellingly clear but have
nothing to do with illustration."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1932 in Hartford, Conn., Doolin grew up in Philadelphia
and graduated from the University of the Arts there in 1954. After a
sojourn in Australia, he moved to Los Angeles to study painting at
UCLA. He earned his master of fine arts degree in 1971, joined the
faculty the following year and taught at the university until 1980,
when he won a three-year Guggenheim Foundation fellowship to paint
desert landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Doolin was revered as the painter of "Shopping Mall," a
90-square-inch aerial view of Santa Monica's commercial center made
over a four-year period, 1973-77. He spent the first two years
sketching and photographing the site from every possible rooftop
vantage point, then constructed a highly detailed diagonal
composition of a busy intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Another major project was a 1992 commission to create four murals
for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's downtown Los Angeles
headquarters. The administrators envisioned a visual account of the
city's history of transportation, said art consultant Tamara Thomas,
who administered the competition to select the artists. She was
delighted when Doolin was chosen because "I knew he would take the
idea further than any of them could imagine," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Always a perfectionist, "he researched every tree and vine" in the
paintings, Thomas said. Then he worked 10-hour days, six days a week
for a year to complete the murals.</TE>
<TE>   His effort paid off for visitors and employees who delight in
pointing out details in scenes that depict a train chugging through
an idyllic orange grove as well as an apocalyptic sunset over a
network of crowded motorways.</TE>
<TE>   He also received official recognition, in the form of National
Endowment for the Arts grants in 1981, 1986 and 1992, and a Los
Angeles Cultural Affairs Department grant in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Lauren Richardson; their daughter, Eve
Doolin; two sons from an earlier marriage, Matthew and Paul Doolin;
and a grandchild.</TE>

<LD>Ned Martin, 78, the radio and television voice of the Boston Red Sox
for 32 years, died Tuesday, a day after attending the Ted Williams
tribute at Fenway Park.</LD>
<LD>   Martin collapsed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North
Carolina after a return trip from Boston, team officials said. The
cause of death was not immediately known.</LD>
<LD>   Martin's trademark call--"Mercy"--was familiar to generations of
Red Sox fans. He called the Carlton Fisk home run that won Game 6 of
the 1975 World Series, Carl Yastrzemski's 3,000th hit in 1979 and
Roger Clemens' first 20-strikeout game in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Philadelphia, Martin served in the Marines in the
Pacific during World War II. The Duke University graduate began his
broadcasting career in 1956 covering minor league baseball in West
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   He joined Curt Gowdy in the Red Sox booth in 1961 and stayed for
the rest of his career. He retired in 1992. Martin was also a
football announcer and did play-by-play for Harvard, Dartmouth and
Yale and the Boston Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a scholar of literature, Martin often quoted Shakespeare,
the Boston Globe obituary reported.</TE>
<TE>   One of his favorite lines, which he used when the Red Sox
encountered difficulties, came from Hamlet: "Oh, Gertrude, when
sorrows come, they come not as single spies but in battalions."</TE>

<HD>Foes Spar Over Secession Ballot Language</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state panel Wednesday sought to head off a last-minute court battle
over the way the costs of San Fernando Valley and Hollywood cityhood
will be presented to voters.</LD>
<LD>   A committee of the Local Agency Formation Commission proposed
compromise ballot language for separation payments the Valley and
Hollywood would have to make to Los Angeles if the areas secede. The
language would inform voters of the annual payments but explain that
the amounts would not represent new costs to taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   "It clarifies the language and provides the voters with a better
understanding," LAFCO member Carol Herrera said of the proposed
ballot text. "The earlier language only told part of the story and
gave a skewed impression that perhaps would raise some alarm bells."</LD>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is scheduled today to formally place the
Valley secession measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. Because of a recent
change in state law, LAFCO has the final say on placing the Hollywood
measure on the ballot, and is set to do so Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents, led by Mayor James K. Hahn and the City
Council, have insisted that the ballot language include the so-called
alimony payments that a Valley or Hollywood city would make for 20
years. But breakup advocates say inserting such language without a
fuller explanation would mislead and frighten voters.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides say they might take legal action if the final ballot
language is not to their liking.</TE>
<TE>   The payments would compensate L.A. for the loss of tax revenue
from the Valley and Hollywood, and represent the amount of taxes the
two areas pay in excess of the value of services they receive.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley payment would be $127.1 million the first year and
decline by 5% annually. Hollywood's payment would start at $21.4
million; it also would drop each year.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials have highlighted the payments in attacking
secession, claiming the new cities would not be able to afford them.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists, however, note that LAFCO accounted for the
payments before determining that Valley and Hollywood cities would be
financially fit. They also say the payments are proof the two areas
are shortchanged by City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The county supervisors seemed split Wednesday on LAFCO's proposed
ballot language.</TE>
<TE>   But City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski and other Los Angeles
officials were skeptical. She said the LAFCO wording could unfairly
help the secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said the language proposed by the council is "nothing
but full disclosure, fully informing the public about what this is
all about."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), the only declared
mayoral candidate for a Valley city, denounced the council and Hahn
as "downtown power mongers using desperate tactics" to confuse voters
about a split's costs.</TE>
<TE>   Richman held a news conference Wednesday at the Northridge
Recreation Center, where a city-owned swimming pool has been closed
for two summers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here because of unpaved Valley streets, inadequate police
deployment, wasteful city spending and unaccountable bureaucrats who
neglect their most fundamental duties to provide city services,"
Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn's anti-secession campaign picked up the support
Wednesday of nearly 50 civic, faith-based and nonprofit leaders and
groups, forming the Civic Coalition for a United Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Attorneys Criticize Proposed Limits on Legal Visits to
Inmates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Proposed changes to visiting rules at state prisons would limit
inmates' access to legal help and reduce public knowledge about
conditions within the penal system, lawyers for convicts say.</LD>
<LD>   The changes were released last week by the Department of
Corrections and are not yet final. A spokeswoman, Terry Thornton,
said the public has until Aug. 9 to submit comments on the proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The department characterized the new rules as an effort to conform
its policies to guidelines set by the State Bar of California. But
critics disputed that reasoning and said the proposed regulations
would infringe on inmates' right to legal representation in a variety
of ways.</LD>
<TE>   The most troubling change, they say, would bar lawyers from
sending a representative to consult with inmates unless that emissary
was a licensed investigator or professional paralegal.</TE>
<TE>   Because prisons are in remote locations, making visits time
consuming, most groups that provide legal help to the incarcerated
rely on interns, volunteers or law students to interview inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules would largely end that practice. They would permit a
law student to interview prisoners, but only if accompanied by an
attorney--a requirement many of the nonprofit legal aid organizations
say they could not afford to meet.</TE>
<TE>   "These rules would completely cripple us," said Cynthia Chandler
of Justice Now, a Bay Area organization providing legal aid to women
in prison. "We are a small nonprofit with only two staff attorneys,
and we rely heavily on students to help us do this work."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler and others also object to a proposed rule requiring a
lawyer to declare one of four purposes in visiting an inmate. The
attorney would have to be the inmate's lawyer of record; be
fulfilling a judicial request; be representing an inmate in a legal
proceeding; or be consulting for possible future representation.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that list excludes many legitimate reasons for their
visits, from interviewing a possible witness to helping inmates with
wills or merely inquiring about prison conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect of this will be to limit access to what's going on
inside," said Steve Fama, a lawyer with the nonprofit Prison Law
Office, which has successfully sued the department over medical care,
mental health treatment and other issues over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton, the Department of Corrections spokeswoman, said it is
not the state's intent to limit access and urged critics to submit
their comments for review.</TE>
<TE>   "These proposed regulations are not carved in stone," she said.
"The department has always supported visiting and sees the value of
it to inmates. The purpose of these changes is simply to bring
consistency to our regulations throughout the system."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed changes are the first overhaul to visiting rules
since the late 1980s. An initial draft was released earlier this year
and created an uproar then--but for a different reason.</TE>
<TE>   That document included new rules for family visits. One sought to
bar children older than 7 from sitting on male inmates' laps, while
another specified that a kiss or embrace could last no longer than
five seconds. A third required photo identification for children over
7.</TE>
<TE>   Corrections Director Edward Alameida scrapped those proposals and
several others after the department received more than 2,000 critical
comments.</TE>
<TE>   The latest proposal makes few changes to family visits but
includes the new rules for legal visits. Thornton said those were
added in response to input from lawyers who said the prison
regulations did not conform to state bar rules.</TE>

<HD>River Water Use Must Be Cut, Official Says</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Interior spokesman discusses plan for state
that might deprive Salton Sea but would help San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY and STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With much of the Western U.S. suffering a severe drought, a top Bush
administration official gently but firmly warned California on
Wednesday to fulfill its promises to use less water from the Colorado
River or suffer a mandatory cutback in the near future.</LD>
<LD>   The call by Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley was backed
by representatives of six other states that depend on the Colorado
River and are eager for California to stop using more than its share.</LD>
<LD>   But while issuing his warning, Raley also offered a possible
solution that would have water from the Imperial Valley sold to San
Diego but that could affect the future of the Salton Sea.</LD>
<TE>   Raley announced that federal agencies began working this week on a
plan that would reduce the amount of costly environmental protection
that California must provide to protect endangered birds and plants
at the Salton Sea. That action could, in turn, clear the way for one
of the state's most ambitious water-conservation deals.</TE>
<TE>   Under that plan, Imperial Valley farmers would cut their water
usage, and their local water district would sell surplus water to San
Diego. But the deal has been held up, in part, because runoff from
those farms keeps the Salton Sea alive.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers in the Imperial Valley have been hesitant to cut their
usage, saying they could one day be accused of depleting the sea and
stuck with a $1-billion bill for reducing salinity and preserving
various endangered birds.</TE>
<TE>   Raley's proposal would ease the way for the water swap by holding
the state to less-than-the-most-stringent environmental standards for
the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   A similar plan to ease state environmental protections is being
sponsored by state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica). The bill has
passed the Senate and is pending in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Valley plans would go a long way toward reducing the
state's overuse of the Colorado River. The plan to cut Imperial
Valley agricultural use could take the state 25% of the way toward
living within its legal limit.</TE>
<TE>   Raley made his remarks in a meeting before a roomful of water
officials, meeting at Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California headquarters in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But Kuehl and Raley's separate proposals to lessen protections for
the sea were denounced by some environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Doyle, director of habitat conservation programs for the
National Wildlife Federation, said Raley's plan, which would allow
voluntary compliance with environmental protections, seems to blame
environmentalists for the state's inability to curb its water use.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle said Raley's idea is "not a solution palatable to the
environmental community in terms of protecting the Salton Sea's ...
incredible biodiversity."</TE>
<TE>   But Raley said he cannot allow California to continue receiving
surplus water from the river unless it delivers on its promises,
including those cutting agricultural use in the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a hard time seeing a defensible rationale that there is
surplus water in the system" without California reducing its take,
Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   That message was reinforced by a number of representatives from
states bordering the Colorado River. They said they are worried about
an apparent lack of progress in California. "We trusted California to
live up to its word," said Pat Mulroy of Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   In warning California of impending cutbacks, Raley is following a
pattern started in the Clinton administration by Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt.</TE>
<TE>   After eight years of cajoling and threatening, Babbitt won an
agreement from California to reduce its use of water and also
persuaded the six other Colorado River states to give California a
grace period of 15 years of surplus water.</TE>
<TE>   But with drought, and a Dec. 31 deadline approaching for two
conservation plans involving the Imperial Valley and the Salton Sea,
the other states are becoming nervous.Raley said that pressure from
other states to suspend the surplus provisions if California does not
meet the deadline "is increasing every day of the drought."</TE>
<TE>   David "Sid" Wilson Jr., general manager with the Central Arizona
Project, said other states are "deadly serious" about weaning
California away from surplus water. "And we expect California to be
deadly serious." The Central Arizona Project carries Colorado River
water to several Arizona counties.</TE>
<TE>   "You raised significant expectations," said Wayne Cook, executive
director of the Upper Colorado River Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Under laws governing distribution of the river, California is
entitled to 4.4 million acre-feet, more than any other state. But 75%
of California's share goes to three irrigation districts that support
desert farming.</TE>
<TE>   To support growing coastal areas, Southern California has been
receiving an additional 800,000 acre-feet of surplus water each year,
enough for 1.6 million families. The proposed sale of water from
Imperial Valley to San Diego is 200,000 acre-feet, a quarter of the
amount the state needs to reduce.</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado River is the major source of imported water for
coastal Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   If California were to lose the entire excess allotment, it would
represent about a 30% annual reduction in imported water.</TE>
<TE>   For areas such as San Diego County, which is nearly devoid of
local water sources, the cut could be ruinous; even for Los Angeles,
which gets water from the Owens Valley, the Colorado River reduction
would present difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Spear, deputy secretary for the California Resources Agency,
said, "To our friends in the other states: You all realize our
situation here. We have a lot of different laws and interested
parties that have to come together in a delicate balance."</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raiser Receives Maximum Penalty: 8 Years, Plus
Restitution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fund-raiser accused of bilking donors out of $27 million that was
supposed to go to injured firefighters, wounded veterans and others
in need was sentenced Wednesday to eight years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Gold, 44, has been the subject of numerous complaints and
investigations over the past decade, but Wednesday is the first time
he received prison time for his actions. Federal judge David O.
Carter handed down the maximum punishment and also ordered the San
Juan Capistrano man to pay $2 million in restitution.</LD>
<LD>   "You've committed illegal activities that should have been
prosecuted a long time ago," Carter told Gold. "You've caused a
ripple effect in the lake that is incredibly harmful.... Because of
you there are foster children with AIDS, veterans without legs, and
burn victims who will suffer.... You set a pretty high standard of
fraud."</LD>
<TE>   Gold pleaded guilty in March to mail fraud and money laundering in
connection with his fund-raising efforts. Prosecutors said that
although Gold claimed he was raising money for such causes as injured
lawmen, he kept all but a tiny percentage for himself.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis of Gold's fund-raising in the late 1990s found
that charities received about 11% of the millions he raised. His
company's telephone pitches appealed to the heart, with operators
telling potential donors of young victims of fires whose scars will
"haunt them for years to come."</TE>
<TE>   More than two dozen of Gold's family members and friends attended
the hearing, and many of them wept as Gold told the judge he was
sorry for his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to apologize to any and all of the victims and for any
pain I may have caused them by my bad decisions," Gold said. "I do
take full responsibility for all of my actions."</TE>
<TE>   Gold and his lawyer, Thomas Bienert, asked the judge for leniency,
saying that Gold was needed to help rear his children and care for a
sick relative.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, called for the stiffest sentence possible,
saying that Gold's apologies were insincere. They pointed out that
attorneys general in five states have tried to stop Gold's
fund-raising with lawsuits. "He just keeps going; there is nothing
that will stop this man," Assistant U.S. Atty. Ellyn Lindsay said.
"The only thing he understands is jail."</TE>

<HD>Angels Prove to Opponents That They Are Playoff Ready</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels have already demonstrated that they're good enough to make
the playoffs. If the season ended today, they'd be in as the American
League wild-card winner.</LD>
<LD>   Now they're starting to show signs that they could actually do
something if they get there-- assuming the players don't strike and
there is a there there.</LD>
<LD>   Their 5-1 victory over the Oakland A's on Wednesday night puts
them in position to win back-to-back series against Oakland and
Seattle if they can beat the A's today. Beyond that, it showed they
can get the type of pitching it would take to beat, say, Oakland in a
playoff series.</LD>
<TE>   Isn't this too much for Angel fans to comprehend? Don't those 1982
uniforms they're wearing this week serve as a painful reminder that
even the best Angel team ever choked on a two-games-to-none lead
against the Milwaukee Brewers in the ALCS that year?</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels, a franchise that has never won a playoff series
and has suffered its share of regular-season collapses, it has always
been a question of whether you want your disappointment now or later.</TE>
<TE>   Will they extend their season just so they can make an early exit?</TE>
<TE>   Not if the pitching comes through the way it has this week.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sele got the victory by going seven innings, giving up six
hits (including a solo home run by Miguel Tejada) and no walks.</TE>
<TE>   That's pretty much the type of effort it takes when matched up
against Oakland's Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder or Barry Zito. And
sometimes even that isn't enough. Just ask Kevin Appier, who gave up
only a two-run homer to Tejada on Tuesday night and lost to Zito.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it goes during the playoffs. Ask Zito, who pitched an
outstanding game against the Yankees last fall, only to lose to a
solo homer by Jorge Posada and that play-for-the-ages by Derek Jeter.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, these are the playoffs. Or at least playoff simulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't use to seem like it with the Angels," Zito said.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, they weren't as close, but this year, [when] we play
everyone in our division it's like a playoff game."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are in the midst of a stretch of 20 consecutive games
against opponents that could make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "As you get into a pennant race, there's going to be games that
are going to have a lot of focus," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to have series that everything from the atmosphere
to the importance you put on every game, it will give you that
playoff environment that hopefully will prepare you for the
postseason."</TE>
<TE>   That said, however, "There's nothing that prepares you for the
postseason like the postseason."</TE>
<TE>   And that's where the Angels are most deficient. Oakland, Seattle
and New York all went to the playoffs last year (Well, the Yankees go
every year).</TE>
<TE>   Sele was with the Mariners last year, so at least he has been
through it.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to pitch well to keep your team in the game," Sele
said. "The starting pitcher can't win the game all by himself, but he
can lose it. I think the West is full of pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Come playoff time, especially in the short first round, you need
two or three guys who can just shut the opponent down and win a game
by themselves.</TE>
<TE>   That's the key ingredient that won the World Series for the
Arizona Diamondbacks last year, and it remains the biggest question
mark for the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's staff is the most coveted. A's starters didn't allow a
run in six of their 12 previous games before Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We like holding down the opposition, obviously," Zito said. "When
you're a starter, you give up zero, one or two runs it's great. The
fact that we might have to do that to win the ballgame, that's not
something we try to go for every time."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia says: What about us? His team's earned-run average was
4.03 before Wednesday, fourth in the league (behind Oakland's 3.87).</TE>
<TE>   "Our staff stacks up, and I think we match up on the mound with
the teams in our division," Scioscia said. "And I hope what they're
looking at is the same thing when they're looking at [Jarrod]
Washburn or they're facing [Ramon] Ortiz and [Kevin] Appier, that
they're going to have to bring their 'A' game and they're going to
have to pitch well on the mound to beat us."</TE>
<TE>   Besides raising esoteric questions (don't the A's, by definition,
always bring their 'A' game?), Scioscia's statement is another phase
in his attempt to raise the bar for the Angels. He uses the phrase
"championship-caliber" quite often when he discusses what he wants
and what he has seen from his club.</TE>
<TE>   "We have those traits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   You can count on the Angels crossing the plate one way or the
other. After all, they're fourth in the majors in scoring. On
Wednesday it was David Eckstein driving in a run with a triple and
scoring on a wild pitch in the third, then Orlando Palmeiro driving
in three runs with a double in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   That's four RBIs from the leadoff and seventh spots in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   They'll need the same amount of resourcefulness from the staff.
Perhaps their guys can't be counted on the way Johnson and Schilling
can, but someone could step up the way Appier and Sele have.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus isn't to start talking about the playoffs," Scioscia
said. "Our focus is to make sure we work all those steps that will
lead to that."</TE>
<TE>   It starts with pitching. And if they're going to continue, that
means even more pitching.</TE>

<HD>Second and Short for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They beat A's, 5-1, to move within one game of
first-place Mariners in the AL West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After coming out on the losing end of shutouts in each of his last
two starts, Aaron Sele of the Angels flirted with one of his own.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran right-hander gave up a seventh-inning home run in his
final inning but was otherwise solid as the Angels defeated the
Oakland Athletics, 5-1, before 25,240 Wednesday night at Edison
Field.</LD>
<LD>   The victory, Sele's first since he shut out the Dodgers on June
29, moved the Angels into first place in the American League
wild-card race and moved them to within one game of the first-place
Seattle Mariners in the AL West.</LD>
<TE>   David Eckstein had a run-scoring triple in the third inning and
Orlando Palmeiro hit a bases-loaded double in the sixth as the Angels
beat the A's for only the fourth time in 11 games this season and
fourth time in the last 21 games between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Sele (8-7) was 15-5 for the Mariners last season and signed a
three-year $24-million contract with the Angels in December.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely looking more like the pitcher we saw last year
and in previous years," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Sele gave up six hits, struck out four and did not walk a batter
before giving way to Brendan Donnelly, a 31-year-old rookie who
pitched two scoreless innings and continued to impress since his
recall from triple-A Salt Lake on July 13.</TE>
<TE>   That was the day Sele gave up four runs in six innings at Kansas
City and Paul Byrd pitched a three-hitter for the Royals in a 4-0
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday at Oakland, Sele gave up two early runs in seven
innings, but Barry Zito and two relievers combined to beat the
Angels, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Angels scored twice in the third inning against
Tim Hudson to give Sele a rare cushion. The five runs scored by the
Angels in the game qualified as an onslaught after producing only one
run in their previous 18 innings against the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "[Two runs] doesn't give you much breathing room, especially the
way he's been pitching and they have been playing," Sele said. "But
it's enough room where you can relax just a little bit and get after
it a little bit more."</TE>
<TE>   Sele did not allow a runner to reach second base in the first five
innings.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, Greg Myers reached on a fielder's choice and
advanced to second on Mark Ellis' single up the middle. Sele then got
Scott Hatteberg to ground out to third baseman Troy Glaus to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   The A's were trailing, 5-0, when Miguel Tejada hit a lead-off home
run against Sele to start the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   It was Hudson's second consecutive loss against the Angels after
winning seven consecutive decisions against them. Nine of his 56 wins
have come against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro, who made an outstanding catch in right field on a ball
hit by David Justice in the second inning, is one player who hits
Hudson well. He began the game 10 for 25 against Hudson and extended
that success in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were leading, 2-0, in the sixth when Garret Anderson
hit a hard ground ball up the middle that glanced off Tejada's glove
at shortstop for a single. Hudson hit Troy Glaus with a pitch and
Brad Fullmer hit a flare single to center field to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro then hit a 3-and-1 pitch into the right-field gap for a
double that gave the Angels a 5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to walk in a run, so I was just hoping he would hit
it at someone," Hudson said. "He did something big league hitters do
nine out of 10 times in that situation--he hit it hard."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored twice in the third inning with Adam Kennedy's
hustle setting up the first run.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy had heard from Scioscia on Tuesday night after he hit a
high pop fly to shallow left field in the ninth inning that Tejada
dropped for an error. Kennedy was slow out of the batter's box and
did not advance to second on the play despite plenty of time to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein's sacrifice bunt moved him to second, but he was left
stranded and the Angels lost, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   "That was uncharacteristic of Adam," Scioscia said before
Wednesday's game. "I talked to him about it and we're moving on."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Kennedy dropped a bunt toward third base and slid
head-first to beat Eric Chavez's throw for a single to start the
third inning. He scored the Angels' first run when Eckstein ripped a
line drive into the right-field gap.</TE>

<HD>Mercedes Moments Will Stay at UCLA</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Anschutz group would love to have tennis
tournament move to Carson, but Kramers remain loyal to pact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the moment, there is no Field of Dreams in the future of men's
summer pro tennis in Los Angeles. Phil Anschutz may be building it,
but Jack and Bob Kramer won't be coming.</LD>
<LD>   At least, not for the moment.</LD>
<LD>   When the Anschutz Entertainment Group announced a couple of years
ago that, as part of a national training center to be built in
Carson, it would construct a shiny new tennis stadium that would be
expandable to 13,000 seats, one conclusion was quick and easy: The
local men's tournament, now known as the Mercedes-Benz Cup and played
at adequate yet unspectacular facilities at UCLA, capacity 7,200,
would be falling all over itself to move.</LD>
<TE>   Nope. Not for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   That message was crystal clear Wednesday, as the tournament
carried on for the 76th year. Bob Kramer, the tournament director,
and his father, Jack, a patriarch for this event and the sport in
general, have an easy-to-understand stance on the matter: They have
80 years left on a 99-year agreement with a partner they are fond of,
UCLA, and they have no intention of messing with that.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is something that can be done that makes both us and
UCLA happy, as well as AEG," Bob Kramer said, "then we're more than
eager to go ahead."</TE>
<TE>   There have been meetings, discussions, jockeying for position. The
most recent meetings were Tuesday. But even with what Bob Kramer
termed "truckloads of money" being tossed their way by AEG to get the
event to move to Carson, the loyalties and ties that bind with UCLA
ever since the 99-year contract was signed just before the 1984
Olympics speak louder than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   At least, for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bob Kramer, the best inroads made toward any movement
of their event was last fall, when the proposal was put on the table
to alternate events at Carson and UCLA with the current Women's
Tennis Assn. event now held each August at the Manhattan Beach Tennis
club, a cozy yet unspectacular venue. UCLA, and such key officials
from the school as John Sandbrook, found that palatable because they
would continue to host a pro event and would, this way, be able to
offer their fans women's tennis as well as men's. Translation: It was
a Title IX-friendly plan. Kramer said that officials of the women's
event seemed open to that discussion too.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while, it seemed like that might work," Bob Kramer said.
"But eventually, we got the sense that Tim [Leiweke, AEG's president]
wanted both events at once. So that plan went away."</TE>
<TE>   But Kramer also was careful to say that AEG's newly named Home
Depot National Training Center is, by no means, being dismissed out
of hand. He and the Southern California Tennis Assn. are hoping to
play a major role in the AEG tennis facility as administrators of
youth tennis programs there. That relationship, Kramer hopes, will
build bridges to the future, and maybe lead to his tournament
eventually moving to Carson.</TE>
<TE>   So there is gridlock, for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke, for his part, remains optimistic and aggressive,
personality staples that keep him running 100 mph every day, doing
deals and building things.</TE>
<TE>   "We are building a world-class, state-of-the art facility," he
said. "It will have the best locker rooms, the best suites,
concessions, parking and campus surroundings. It is the intention for
this stadium to be as good as any stadium in the country, except for
Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "We respect what the SCTA has in the way of its processes, and we
respect the tradition of the event. But we feel, at the end of the
day, when everybody sits down and looks at the situation for the good
of the players and the fans and the city of L.A., the right thing
will be done."</TE>
<TE>   So the politics will continue, for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   The United States Tennis Assn., often criticized for being
slow-moving and less than innovative in a sport that needs every
glimmer of new ideas it can find these days, wants to use the L.A.
event as the kickoff to its important and lucrative post-Wimbledon,
hard-court summer season. And it wants to do it big-time, in a shiny
new facility, with network TV cameras turned on and rich TV rights
money in the coffers.</TE>
<TE>   IMG, the International Management Group that wields a big stick in
men's and women's tennis and wasn't happy when Leiweke and AEG
maneuvered the Women's Tennis Assn.'s season-ending event to Staples
Center this November, will need to stop sulking about losing that
fight.</TE>
<TE>   AEG will need to figure out a way to compensate UCLA for an annual
financial boost from the Mercedes event of around $300,000, money
that has done such things as help build the Arthur Ashe Student

<HD>Sinking From View</HD>
<DH>Until boat went down, not much was heard from Dennis Conner
in America's Cup buildup</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICH ROBERTS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While operations were underway to raise Dennis Conner's sunken Stars
&amp; Stripes USA 77 to the surface off Long Beach late Tuesday
afternoon, the owner was nowhere to be seen, leading some to wonder
whether he had gone down with the ship.</LD>
<LD>   No, he was back at the training base on Terminal Island fixing
dinner for his cold, hungry crew that would be bringing the salvaged
vessel home shortly before midnight.</LD>
<LD>   "Dennis had come back and made a big pot of chili for all the
guys," said Bill Trenkle, general manager of Team Dennis Conner.
"They really appreciated it because some of them had been diving and
hooking up the crane. There were plenty of cold puppies that
appreciated the warm chili."</LD>
<TE>   Conner hadn't been on the boat. He seldom is these days. Confident
to leave sailing and administrative matters in capable hands, he
spends more time schmoozing with sponsors who are providing the $30
million-$40 million necessary to run a successful America's Cup
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The America's Cup trials begin Oct. 1 in Auckland, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, when USA 77 sank, he and some sponsors were on a launch
on their way to meet the boat to go for a ride.</TE>
<TE>   As Trenkle said, "About 99% of the time, we're offshore in a
couple thousand feet of water, which would have been a bad place to
sink."</TE>
<TE>   There would be little hope of recovering the boat from the middle
of the San Pedro Channel between Santa Catalina Island and the
mainland, where the team normally works. But, on this occasion, they
had come in closer to transfer the VIPs onto the race boat in the
calmer waters behind the Long Beach breakwater.</TE>
<TE>   Thank heaven for sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Technically, it was not a sinking. It was a grounding and a
swamping," Conner said.</TE>
<TE>   Another small miracle was how the boat remained upright after it
sank, half its 110-foot mast remaining out of the water. The secret:
Before it went down in about four minutes, the crew had inflated some
air bags inside, and then the keel planted itself in the mud like a
tulip.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the 15 crew members, including navigator Peter Isler,
jumped into the water, the others hopping onto chase boats.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have a chance really to think," Isler said. "Just act
fast, helping to pull down the sails, pass out life jackets, get the
pumps and air bags distributed in the right place, and then it was
time to jump in."</TE>
<TE>   Although a structural failure in the rudder housing caused the
boat to sink, there also was concern about the 18-inch cracks along
the port and starboard gunwales, opposite the mast.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard some cracks when it went down," Trenkle said, "so we're
still trying to sort that out."</TE>
<TE>   But he did not link the cracks with the broken hulls that sank
oneAustralia at San Diego in 1995 and almost sank Young America at
Auckland in '99.</TE>
<TE>   Trenkle said, "The other failures happened back by the keel area,
which is much more highly stressed, well aft of the mast. [These
cracks] are not really in a critical part of the boat."</TE>
<TE>   It's unusual that the incident even occurred in the United States.
For more than a year, eight of the nine challengers have been in and
out of Auckland with the seasons like swallows, probably wondering
what Team DC was up to 7,500 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The six-month routine of testing and training started with USA 66
breaking its mast in February, before USA 77 was built. That it ended
with USA 77 surviving a sinking is about all the rest of the sailing
world knows.</TE>
<TE>   With as low a profile as Mr. America's Cup can manage, Conner has
chosen to work in relative isolation from a modest base lost amid the
containers and cranes of the massive commercial shipping operation.</TE>
<TE>   Their last sail will be today, albeit with a single boat, USA 66.
The injured USA 77 will be shipped to New Zealand on Wednesday, to be
followed by USA 66 a week later.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll go down to New Zealand and be repaired and we'll be sailing
by the end of August, as we planned," Trenkle said.</TE>
<TE>   Conner said the damage "is definitely not mortal."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of hiccups like a broken mast and a sunken boat aside,
the training program has been rated successful.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had excellent conditions, from nine to 20 knots [of wind],
so we've had a lot of good sailing," Conner said.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-mile-wide channel is ideal for fine-tuning America's Cup
boats, as Paul Cayard's AmericaOne team learned in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Trenkle said, "This has let us train every day without the
constraints of bad weather. Compared to most places, it's very
reliable. We haven't lost one day because of bad weather or no wind."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Read, the 40-year-old helmsman from Newport, R.I., has driven
one boat, tactician Terry Hutchinson the other. The crews might as
well have been punching clocks. They sail together upwind for a long
time, then they sail together downwind, testing incremental
adjustments in sail trim and sailing angles against the static
platform provided by the other boat.</TE>
<TE>   It's not very compelling drama, but it exploits a valuable tool
the team lacked in 1999-2000: a second state-of-the-art boat for a
benchmark.</TE>
<TE>   What does it achieve?</TE>
<TE>   Conner said, "In the end, it's gonna be who has the fast boat and
makes the fewest mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   That's as controversial a comment as he has made recently. This
time he has remained relatively clear of the usual America's Cup
squabbling. He's letting other guys play that game.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison took Cayard, one of the world's
most illustrious and charismatic sailors, off his sailing team for
reasons still unexplained but most likely nothing more than envy.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld, the Seattle-based syndicate owned by billionaires Craig
McCaw and Paul Allen, is in trouble for allegedly stealing design
data from defender Team New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's elegant Prada also is sweating out a decision that
could--but probably won't--mean disqualification for suing Oracle for
allegedly playing peekaboo from a barge located partially in front of
Oracle's compound. Suing a rival is prohibited by the America's Cup
Protocol.</TE>
<TE>   Project manager Mats Johansson continues with Sweden's Victory
Challenge, pending appeal after being sentenced to eight months in
jail for tax evasion.</TE>
<TE>   With all that, sailing pundits generally rate Team Dennis Conner
no worse than No. 2 among the challengers, behind Switzerland's
Alinghi led by former New Zealand national hero-turned-defector,
Russell Coutts.</TE>
<TE>   Conner is not impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Who remembers who finished second?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Actually ...</TE>
<TE>   For this campaign, his ninth, Conner is reunited with the proud
New York Yacht Club, which he last represented when he lost the Cup
to Alan Bond's Australia II in 1983 at Newport, R.I. It took the club
a couple decades to get over it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Conner went to Fremantle in '86-87 to get it back from
the Aussies for the San Diego Yacht Club. Although he lost it to New
Zealand at San Diego in '95, the earlier success remains the defining
moment of his career.</TE>
<TE>   That was the last time he had more than one boat--the first in a
long line of Stars &amp; Stripes, long before patriotism was back in
style. As in '86-87, the first-string crew is made up of all
Americans, one of the few boats that will race with a single
nationality of sailors.</TE>
<TE>   There is another parallel to '86-87 in the current campaign. While
everyone else was in one another's faces in Australia, Conner tested
and trained in Hawaii, then blew everybody away at Fremantle.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen years later, Conner has surrendered the sailing to younger
blood, although he still races regularly on his personal boats.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather have Kenny's job," Conner said. "But if I didn't raise
the money, we wouldn't have a campaign."</TE>
<TE>   He almost didn't have one last time.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking funds, he filed his challenge at the last minute, had only
one boat built--hastily--and the team met for the first time in
Auckland only a month before its first race.</TE>
<TE>   Read said, "Can you imagine what we did last time ... how little
time we had and how unprepared we were? We showed up there with 30
days to go before our first race. As a team we had never stepped on
an America's Cup boat together, and here we are sailing since Feb. 2.
It seems like a dream come true."</TE>
<TE>   In that previous campaign, Stars &amp; Stripes came up one point short
of qualifying for a sail off against Prada for the second slot in the
challenger finals, opposite AmericaOne--after having had a point
deducted earlier for using a rudder built illegally in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   That's what has rivals worried now: If Team Dennis Conner could
come so close with so little, what will it do with its present
resources?</TE>
<TE>   Conner also will tell you that in America's Cup history, the most
money often fails to win.</TE>
<TE>   But sponsors are important. They can save your boat.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers, Mota Struggle Again</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Reliever gives up four runs without recording an
out, and L.A. offense falls flat in 8-0 loss to Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers seem to specialize in finding silver linings in the dark
clouds that have hovered over them since the All-Star break, so in
that vein, there was one bright spot to their 8-0 loss to the San
Diego Padres before 26,779 in Qualcomm Stadium on Wednesday: They
couldn't be criticized for their performance with runners in scoring
position.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the Dodgers did not have a runner in scoring
position, failing to advance a runner to second base in eight innings
against soft-serving starter Bobby Jones and one inning against
reliever Brandon Villafuerte.</LD>
<LD>   After collecting 13 singles in Monday night's 5-2 loss to the
Padres and collecting eight runs and 11 hits in Tuesday night's 8-6
win, the Dodgers were shut out for the 11th time this season, tying
them with Kansas City and Tampa Bay for the most shutouts in the
major leagues.</LD>
<TE>   The loss, combined with San Francisco's victory over St. Louis,
dropped the Dodgers back into third place in the NL West. They fell 3
1/2 games behind first-place Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Nevin broke open a two-run game with a three-run home run off
struggling Dodger reliever Guillermo Mota in the seventh, and Ron
Gant added a two-run blast off Mota to send the Dodgers to their 12th
loss in the last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers managed five hits, and only two of them reached the
outfield. Dave Roberts bunted for a single to lead off the game, and
Brian Jordan hit infield singles in the fourth and seventh innings.</TE>
<TE>   "No runners to second base ... that's almost pitiful," Roberts
said. "I'm very surprised, because we've hit the ball well for the
past week, and today we couldn't get anything going.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to build on something like [Tuesday] night, and instead
we go in reverse."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have won three games since the All-Star break, and
after each victory, a familiar refrain emanated from their clubhouse:
This was the game that would turn things around, the one that would
build momentum.</TE>
<TE>   But their 2-1 win over Arizona on July 14 was followed by five
consecutive losses. Their 4-2 win over San Francisco on Saturday was
followed by two losses. And after Tuesday's win, the Dodgers were
blanked for eight innings by a pitcher who hasn't thrown a shutout in
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a control freak whose fastball tops out at 87 mph, gave up
five hits, struck out four and walked none to improve to 7-5. Of his
103 pitches, 80 were strikes. Dodger left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii gave
up three runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings to fall to 12-6.</TE>
<TE>   "We were unable to put any kind of offense together--that's a
phrase I've used a lot in the last 10-12 days," Manager Jim Tracy
said. "It's going to be hard to win games with five hits, three of
them infield singles. But we struggled like this to score earlier in
the season, and at some point we will dig ourselves out again."</TE>
<TE>   A lack of hitting isn't Tracy's only concern.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers believe they bolstered their offense with Tuesday's
acquisition of utility player Tyler Houston from the Milwaukee
Brewers, but if they're going to stay in the playoff hunt, they need
to upgrade their bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Never was that more apparent than Wednesday, when Mota replaced
Ishii in the seventh inning with one out, a runner on first and the
Dodgers trailing, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Mota, acquired in a spring-training trade with Montreal, has shown
flashes of brilliance this season, including a seven-appearance
stretch from June 27-July 14 in which he allowed only one earned run
and two hits in 10 innings.</TE>
<TE>   But he was bombed for four runs without recording an out
Wednesday, walking Julius Matos, giving up a three-run home run on an
0-and-2 pitch to Nevin, walking Ryan Klesko and giving up a two-run
homer on a 3-and-1 pitch to Gant, turning a two-run game into a
seven-run rout.</TE>
<TE>   Just a week and a half ago, it appeared Mota might move ahead of
Paul Quantrill and Giovanni Carrara in the bullpen pecking order to
become the Dodgers' top set-up man in front of closer Eric Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   But after giving up 10 earned runs and 11 hits in 5 2/3 innings of
his last six appearances, Mota has been even more erratic than
Carrara, leaving the Dodgers with only one consistent, reliable
reliever besides Gagne--Quantrill.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a great opportunity for [Mota] to learn something,
because all of his pitches were to his arm side and up, which is
typical for a guy who has pitched a lot," pitching coach Jim Colborn
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make an adjustment, and he isn't experienced enough
to recognize it.... We have various goals, and one is developing our
young talent."</TE>
<TE>   But the heat of a pennant race may not be the best grounds for
development, and that's why General Manager Dan Evans' search for
relief help probably intensified Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>He Banks on It: The Little Guy Can Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I will grant you at the outset that I usually have only a vague
notion of what's going on with my checking account at Bank of
America.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, I have no idea what the status of our household
finances are. I know as much about our budget as I do about Euclidean
geometry, which is nothing at all. My wife, the ebullient Cinelli,
could be stashing money away in a Swiss bank and I would have no
knowledge of it.</LD>
<LD>   I say that by way of explaining that my monetary world is pretty
much limited to an allowance I am given once a month for what she
calls haircuts and martinis. Because I am not to be trusted with
loose money in my pocket for longer than an hour or so, I deposit it
instantly.</LD>
<TE>   After that, I proceed to write checks up to the amount which I
know more or less is in my account, being careful to deduct the $14 a
month the bank charges me for the privilege of using its services.</TE>
<TE>   It is $14 well spent. In the second quarter of this year, Bank of
America's earnings grew by 10% to $2.22 billion, solidifying its
position as a leading financial institution in this country. I've
trusted them to use my $14 wisely and they haven't disappointed me.
And I'll bet they don't even own a shredding machine.</TE>
<TE>   Having said that, I bring you news today of an error the bank
made. It is not likely to cause any fluctuations in the stock market
or to deepen the frown on the face of Alan Greenspan, but it is an
instance of triumph for a little person who challenged a giant and
won. Listen while I relate the tale of Elmer and Goliath.</TE>
<TE>   It began when I started noticing that my Bank of America Visa card
was being called upon to back up checks I had supposedly written
against insufficient funds. Not just once, but three or four times in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   When I mentioned to Cinelli that something was wrong, she said,
"How would you know? I found a box full of your bank statements going
back to the last century, and none of them had even been opened."</TE>
<TE>   "You say 'last century' like it was in the Bronze Age. It was only
a few years ago."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, well, forgive me, Elmer. A few years of unopened bank
statements is hardly anything at all. I'll check you again in 2050."</TE>
<TE>   She is among a small group of people who call me Elmer due to my
tendency to occasionally slur my name so it comes out sounding like
Elmer Teenez. Anyhow, I rummaged through the box, found the latest
statement and discovered that a check I had dropped into one of those
instant-deposit slots had never been credited to my account.</TE>
<TE>   I telephoned the bank and ended up with a woman with an accent so
thick I couldn't understand what she was saying. I don't know if she
was from Ecuador or South Yemen, but I only got about every third
word. Like "the," "no" and "however."</TE>
<TE>   She must have understood my problem, because a few days later I
received a letter from the bank saying that the check in question had
indeed been deposited ... to my wife's account. It wasn't exactly a
time for them to pound their chest and bellow the great ape's cry of
victory, but there was nevertheless a certain smugness to their tone.</TE>
<TE>   They had misdeposited the check, but were implying that it was
somehow my fault. They felt no compulsion to apologize or even to
explain how they could have done such a stupid thing. The letter
concluded with, "We have closed the investigation on your claim." Oh,
no you haven't, baby.</TE>
<TE>   I followed up with a phone call and was connected to Yolanda. Up
until then, I was like a character in a Shelley Berman monologue,
wading through telephonic menus and clerks with limited knowledge
toward an elusive paradise that contained The Person Who Could Help
Me. Yolanda was the one. I mean The One.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how that happened," she said, referring to the
misdeposit. There was kindness in her voice, and sympathy. Nuns sound
the same way when they aren't whacking you with a ruler.</TE>
<TE>   She straightened everything out and then switched me to Brenda,
who was the Visa Person. The advantage was mine now, so I demanded
that service charges placed against me by Visa for backing up my
bounced checks be removed from my account, because the backing-up had
been unnecessary in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   While not as warm and cozy as Yolanda, she was every bit as
efficient and agreed that I should not have to pay the fees required
for check-backing.</TE>
<TE>   Final victory was achieved when Cinelli admitted that she had
noticed the extra money deposited in her account but figured it was
income from rental property or a refund from a catalog company. She
wrote me a check for the amount and mumbled something to the effect
that her investigation of my claim was also closed.</TE>
<TE>   I am back to contributing $14 a month to the stability of Bank of
America and to ignoring its periodic statements as incomprehensible
pieces of paper with numbers on them. Things are normal. Life is
good.</TE>

<LD>BRONX BOY</LD>
<LD>   A Memoir</LD>
<LD>   By Jerome Charyn</LD>
<TE>   Thomas Dunne / St. Martin's</TE>
<TE>   186 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   In "Bronx Boy," the final memoir of his coming-of-age trilogy,
Jerome Charyn ("The Dark Lady from Belorusse," "The Black Swan")
offers a nostalgic look at his midcentury boyhood in the Bronx, spent
among small-time gangsters. If the book reads more like a novel than
a memoir, that's because, as the author concedes, some of the
incidents and people are "the product of imaginative re-creation and
these re-creations are not intended to portray actual characters,
places, or events."</TE>
<TE>   Although Charyn offers his disclaimer at the conclusion of the
book, it's fairly clear from the start that he has chosen to heed the
famous advice of Emily Dickinson: "Tell all the Truth but tell it
slant." Unlike HBO's "The Sopranos," the highly colorful mobsters of
Charyn's adolescence are more lovable than nasty, but their dialogue
is just as snappy.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the Bronx Boys," Charyn writes, "a gang that cut across
racial and religious lines because we belonged to the democracy of a
candy store." The young Charyn and his friends idolize Tully Holland,
the junkie and ex-con who runs the local candy store, which becomes
their primary hangout. Yet the author portrays himself as an
ambivalent gang member, too sensitive to commit any acts of real
cruelty, and too smart and bookish to align himself wholeheartedly
with his crew (his nickname is "Baby"). He hesitates to wear the
gang's signature jacket away from the candy shop, fearing the display
will ruin his chances of winning a prestigious academic fellowship in
Chicago. "I wanted to get out of the Bronx," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from confessing to having forged his father's signature and
skipping school to visit movie theaters in the West Bronx, Charyn
isn't much of a criminal. He knows that he does not really belong
with his peers, a fact that leaves him both hopeful and disappointed
at what the future will deliver. It's hilarious to imagine this boy
with the mind of a "melancholy volcano," immersed in Dostoevsky and
Flaubert, mixing with the famed gangster Meyer Lansky, but he
did--and their encounters provide some of the book's funniest
passages.</TE>
<TE>   When Charyn abruptly falls into disfavor with Lansky, a henchman
says, "Kid, what can I tell ya? Meyer's a moody man. First he likes
you and then he doesn't." Charyn is a much better storyteller than he
is a stylist; his prose often seems dated and awkward: "I danced with
Anita, her chest against mine. I was the luckiest lad at junior high.
But there wasn't even a stirring in my pants. I was like a neutered
cat." He is such a good storyteller, though, that his talent makes
style (and accuracy) seem slightly less important.</TE>
<TE>   Much of what Charyn claims to have witnessed among thugs calls to
mind the material of such mobster-lite films as "Analyze This." He
becomes involved in turf wars, favorite son wars and deals gone
wrong, and he constantly battles his own conscience. Yet Charyn's
appealing voice makes his tall tales more entertaining than they
might have been in the hands of another author. It's a voice
reminiscent of J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield: "The painter was
called Gustav Klimt. I'd never heard of him, but he must have been a
genius. Sarah told me about this guy Klimt and the story of Judith,
which was from some lost book of the bible."</TE>
<TE>   Sarah is Tully Holland's heroin-addicted girlfriend, who also
happens to be a prostitute. One day Tully designates Charyn to be her
secretary and bodyguard, and with Sarah, Charyn finds the most
complex relationship he has ever known: tender and intimate, maternal
and sexual. Like Holden Caulfield, Charyn is exceedingly unlucky in
love, and his intense, fumbling sexual experiences with Sarah and
other women add to the book's charm.</TE>
<TE>   Family in "Bronx Boy" is defined more by peers and teachers than
actual biology, so Charyn's parents play minor roles in the book. His
mother is more central to his life; Charyn relates that because she
is going blind during his adolescence, he loves reading and telling
stories to her. His Clark Gable-look-alike father--who would "come
home with the smell of cheap perfume, lipstick under his chin"--is
left mostly in the background. Charyn looks to neighborhood men he
admires, not his father, for mentoring and support.</TE>
<TE>   With its vividly drawn characters, ample humor and affectionate
recollection of a golden era in the Bronx, Charyn's memoir is hard to
dislike. However, as is true of Dave Egger's more accomplished and
intricate memoir, "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius," the
blurry line between fact and imagination proves occasionally
frustrating for the reader. Why not just write a novel? But if one
ignores the fact of the truth being told slant, "Bronx Boy" is a
pleasurable and breezy read, one destined for a second life
on-screen.</TE>

<DH>Richard Holbrook's dna furniture line is aimed at small
business needs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as DNA is the building block of life, the dna line of modular
components designed by Richard Holbrook can provide the building
blocks of a small office. Holbrook's own space, in the second story
of a renovated 1926 former bank building in Old Town Pasadena, is a
showcase example. A comfortable blend of refinished oak flooring and
exposed brickwork offsets the high-tech furnishings made from hard
polycarbonate and brushed metal alloy.</LD>
<LD>   As would be expected, most of Holbrook's workspace is made up of
his firm's components; his desk is a simple white tabletop with
nicely rounded edges seated on four brushed-metal legs atop rollers.
To the side and behind are two wall-mounted units--storage cubicles
and drawer units interspersed with shelves and work surfaces, mounted
on vertical rails.</LD>
<LD>   Holbrook, 43, created dna to respond to the ever-evolving
requirements of small businesses. "The system's meant to be highly
flexible," he says. "You can put these things together to suit your
needs." And, he adds, it's also designed to be durable and
affordable--a typical workstation, with wall unit and table, costs
from $750 to $1,400.</LD>
<TE>   In the showroom on street level, Holbrook shows how dna units are
assembled. The standard storage cubicle is 14-by-14 inches and the
shelves 14 inches across, and the individual components can be
aligned or offset to create a zigzag effect. Each shipment comes with
a yardstick, a level and a paper tape guide that indicates the space
required between the vertical support rails. The rails are mounted to
the wall, then work surface and cabinets can be attached through a
pin-lock system. To demonstrate the weight-bearing strength of a
wall-mounted cubicle, Holbrook grasps onto one and executes a couple
of chin-ups. "I don't recommend others doing this though," he quips.</TE>
<TE>   A workstation can also be free-standing or, for maximum mobility,
mounted on wheels. Movable screens are available to divide
workstations, and dna also has a line of accessories such as pencil
cups, coat hooks and CD clips that can be attached to a track.
Ergonomic chairs are also part of the dna line, either plain with
ventilated backs or minimally upholstered. With time, more items will
be added to the system.</TE>
<TE>   Holbrook has kept his color palette simple and modern--brushed
silver alloy rails and cabinet shells, with white, gray, black and
orange for cabinet fronts and work surfaces. "I wanted to keep it all
very simple, and let people's own things decorate the environment,"
he says. His own workspace displays memorabilia and snapshots of his
family on the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, Holbrook had an inclination for drawing and for
cars, but growing up in a working-class family in La Mirada, it never
occurred to him to go to college. A high-school teacher recognized
his talent and suggested a Saturday class at the Art Center College
of Design in Pasadena. "It was the most tremendous revelation,"
Holbrook says. "It dawned on me that I might actually make a living
designing cars, drawing cars, which I loved to do."</TE>
<TE>   He applied for full matriculation to the Art Center, was accepted
and, through a scholarship and part-time work, made his way through
four years. Upon graduation in 1981, he was offered a dream job--to
work on car design for Peugeot in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Holbrook spent his first two years at Peugeot in Coventry,
England, then transferred to Paris for another two years, eventually
becoming a design chief. He worked on every aspect of the design for
a low-slung, angular sedan--from the nose to the tailpipe. But the
car was never put into mass production. A competing design by Sergio
Pininfarina, the Italian responsible for the look of many Ferraris
and Alfa Romeos, won out, says Holbrook, "because he had the name
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   The experience soured Holbrook on corporate life. "I couldn't face
the idea that I could work there the rest of my career and never have
anything on the road," he says. "And then the whole corporate
thing--the bureaucracy, the politics, all that stuff. I realized I'm
a entrepreneur at heart. I love taking risks and reaping the rewards
of those risks."</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Holbrook returned to California, taught commercial design
at his alma mater and started up his first design company. Over the
years he has designed kitchen appliances for Dacor and Thermidor,
ceiling fans for Casablanca Fan Co., and furniture for Herman Miller.
Among his best-known work for the latter are the highly adjustable
Ambi chair, which sells for $500 to $800 depending on the features,
and the Levity workstation, which Holbrook has in a corner of his dna
office. He shows how the Levity's desk surface can be height-adjusted
with ease, even when fully laden. In 1998, the Levity system won the
Gold Award for Innovation at the NeoCon design conference, but it was
so expensive to produce that sales lagged--and it was eventually
discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Holbrook decided to create more affordable office
furniture, focusing on small business and the home office. He asked
himself, "How can I use the Internet along with some inventive
product design to help solve the needs of people in small to medium
business at a price and delivery time that would be acceptable?"</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he and business partner Michael Shannon signed an
agreement with Teknion, a well-known office furniture company based
in Toronto, to create the dna company. The line is currently sold
through Teknion dealers throughout the United States, as well as
online at www.tekniondna.com. They can be seen at Workplace Interiors
in Culver City, Jules Seltzer Associates on Beverly Boulevard, or dna
headquarters at 24 N. Marengo Ave., Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Being involved in all aspects of his fledgling company is his
passion, from the creation of the products to the marketing strategy.
"I'm designing a company, that's the fun for me," he says. "It's hard
to find companies that have a true integrity of design and vision
running all the way through--my dream was to get enough independence
to create a brand."</TE>

<HD>A Deep Appreciation for All That Is Freaky</HD>
<DH>A new book showcases oddities put up for bid on EBay--like
canned deer dung and a goat-toenail bracelet</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After gawking at Marc Hartzman's new book, it's hard to get excited
about the latest rash of "amazing" discoveries being trumpeted in the
news. So what if researchers just uncovered a 7-million-year-old
human skull, a 500-year-old drawing by Michelangelo and the shipwreck
of JFK's fabled PT-109 boat?</LD>
<LD>   Such treasures pale in comparison to the artifacts unearthed by
Hartzman in "Found on EBay" (Universe Publishing), an encyclopedia of
weird knickknacks sold on the Internet auction site.</LD>
<LD>   The items include canned deer dung, a human soul, used dentures, a
bracelet made from goat toenails, a JFK garden gnome and a
Connecticut woman's colonoscopy photos.</LD>
<TE>   All told, Hartzman rounded up 101 unusual items, which are
displayed alongside color photographs and wacky e-mail exchanges with
some of the sellers. Hartzman also reprints the amusing sales pitches
posted on EBay for each item.</TE>
<TE>   The description of a solitary size-9 work boot says: "Somebody
stole the left boot, so I must sell the right boot.... This boot has
seen many places, including, but not limited to: Seattle, Washington,
most of the state of Oregon, northern Calif., the Polk County and
Marion County jails [and] all three of my kids' [backsides]. Whoever
stole my left boot, here is your chance to get the other one. Or if
you only have a right leg, this is a real bargain." After an opening
bid of $1, the shoe sold for $1.25.</TE>
<TE>   The ad for a human soul said: "This is an auction for [the] soul
of one of my friends. He, being an atheist, bet his soul ... in a
game of Golden Eye on N64. Too bad for him, he lost and now his soul
is mine, but now it can be yours!"</TE>
<TE>   EBay officials closed down the auction, saying the site "does not
allow the auctioning of human souls for the following reasons: If the
soul does not exist, EBay could not allow the auctioning of the soul
because there would be nothing to sell. However, if the soul does
exist, then, in accordance with EBay's policy on human parts and
remains, we would not allow the auctioning of human souls."</TE>
<TE>   Hartzman, 27, an advertising copywriter who also edits a small
humor magazine, hatched the idea for his book while searching for
circus-freak and sideshow memorabilia, which he collects. He logged
onto EBay.com and noticed all sorts of bizarre paraphernalia.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sellers cooperated with his project (some even loaned
him their items for photographs), but several declined, including a
guy who was peddling a convenience-store smock with a bullet hole
from a nonfatal robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The book's photos were snapped by Hartzman's fiancee, Liz Steger,
to whom he recently proposed using a ring once worn by a circus
giant.</TE>
<TE>   Researching and writing about EBay, the Internet's version of a
yard sale, was a natural fit for the author, who says he "always
saved stuff growing up." His apartment in Hoboken, N.J., is littered
with "40 or 50" of the items he chronicled in the book. Hartzman
spent an estimated $1,000 on the collection.</TE>
<TE>   His favorite item? "The deer-poop paperweight, just because of the
effort that went into making it," he says. "Someone had to go out and
collect the stuff."</TE>
<TE>   He's also fond of the JFK garden gnome, which was manufactured in
Germany in 1963 as part of a political garden gnome series that
included Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and France's Charles de
Gaulle. On EBay, it netted $103.50.</TE>
<TE>   Other items in the book include a moist towelette from the 1970s
(which sold for $9.95), a peach pit carved to look like a monkey by a
soldier in a World War II foxhole, a leather belt buckle with a glass
eye in the middle, a hornet's nest ("hornets not included"), a
two-headed cow, a wooden leg and "absolutely nothing" (which sold for
$1.03).</TE>
<TE>   Fiancee Steger is less than thrilled with many of her future
husband's purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of this stuff will be up for sale again on EBay very soon,"
she says. "Like the hornet's nest. It's cool, but where do you put
it?"</TE>
<TE>   Then again, her tastes aren't totally out of sync with Hartzman's.</TE>
<TE>   "We both want to buy the stuffed, two-headed calf," she says.
"That would be a great centerpiece for a living room."</TE>

<LD>Carl Vander Schuit is a commercial photographer in San Diego who is
addicted to light. He had this crazy idea to illuminate ice cubes,
and his brother, David Warren, an engineer, figured out how to make
it work: With waterproof plastic filled with nontoxic refreezeable
gel and battery-operated lightbulbs, Litecubes were born.</LD>
<LD>   Tap the 1-inch cube on one side to activate the lithium battery;
tap it on another side to turn it off (unlike single-use glow sticks,
these cubes can be reused for a total of 12 or more hours). The
realistic-looking translucent cubes are beverage and food safe, and
although they don't melt (they just look as if they have started to),
they work best if frozen first and used with real ice cubes.</LD>
<LD>   People are finding wacky uses for the glowing cubes. Children play
with them in the bathtub and swimming pool; adults use them to add
sparkle to martini glasses and hot tubs; party hosts put them in
punchbowls and along walkways; and says Warren, "My grandmother uses
it in her water glass on her nightstand so she can find it during the
night." He says he's seen caterers put blue cubes inside funnel
cakes, and red cubes under shrimp.</LD>
<TE>   The cubes sell for about $2.50 each. Restoration Hardware has
stocked trickier blue-and-white cubes ($15, set of four) while
Internet sites such as americantailga ter.com  offer the original
colors: yellow, orange, red and green. For more information,
www.litecube. com.</TE>
<TE>   There are as many types of coolers as there are beverages to
squeeze into them. And, if vacant shelves at stores are any
indication, people are snapping up more than one to fit different
needs.</TE>
<TE>   There are soft-sided coolers that keep lunch fresh and can be
folded into a backpack or briefcase for the ride home. And there are
wide-body tough plastic ones that have all-terrain wheels to glide
over bumps or sand, and tow handles that make transporting them a
one-hand operation. They come in a paint box of colors, and cost from
$10 to $100.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the vast offerings already available to keep perishables
well-insulated, there are new designs every summer. Rubbermaid has
come out with a Slim Cooler ($12.99) that is only 6.7-inches wide,
which is narrow enough to fit between or behind car seats. It holds
12 cans or five 1-liter bottles of water or wine. Two drink holders
are molded into the lid, which splits in two to access one side at a
time. Testers at the Good Housekeeping Institute say the Slim Cooler
keeps snacks ice cold for eight hours. For more information,
www.Rubbermaid.com.</TE>

<DH>Londoner Christopher Farr's new L.A. gallery showcases
underfoot artwork</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seemed so simple to the college-age painter on vacation: He would
translate his love of contemporary art onto handmade rugs. But
Christopher Farr's three-decade journey from being inspired by the
pre-Columbian textiles he saw in Peru to helping to revitalize an art
form has been anything but easy.</LD>
<LD>   To create the sensuous rugs in the Los Angeles gallery he's just
opened, Farr has had to honor the ancient process of hand-knotting
while inventing weaving techniques that allow his free-flowing art to
come first. Along the way, the Londoner, who has achieved his organic
shapes only with time-consuming craftsmanship, has guided other
artists in rug design and received critical acclaim.</LD>
<LD>   "Christopher Farr's designs transcend the functional into the
lyrical," says Andrea Fiuczynski, president of Christie's Los
Angeles, who attended a reception at Farr's gallery last week to
celebrate the opening of his first U.S. showroom and the release of
his new book, "Contemporary Rugs: Art and Design" (Merrell, 2002), a
100-year history of modern rugs. "His works are powerful yet poetic,
exclamations of color celebrating art."</LD>
<TE>   One of Farr's most popular rugs, "Huaras," was inspired by an Inca
fortress he saw in Cuzco, Peru, in 1973. Three soft-edged
boulder-like forms in light gray, wheat yellow and burnt orange are
stacked on a 10-by-13-foot, taupe-colored field. Another rug, "Code,"
from his new collection, is 9 by 12 feet and has three sets of
hard-edged stripes in gray, reddish brown and lilac sharing space
with solid blocks of ivory.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Farr's rugs bear his signature logo and are limited to
editions of 15, and prices can be steep: "Huaras" costs just under
$14,000 and "Code" is priced at $12,000. This combination creates a
collectible art market for fine rug designers following in the
tradition of such artists as Miro, Picasso, Lichtenstein and others
who have also wrestled with the difficult medium of wool and pile.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a world of creativity out there, and artists know that
it's OK to seduce, to invite in any medium, and it's not without
content because it's on the floor," says Farr, who was celebrated for
replicating the Bauhaus carpets of Gunta Stolzl for an exhibition at
the Royal Institute of British Architects two years ago..</TE>
<TE>   His new book recognizes the work of rug artists who have broken
traditional rules of symmetrical shape and repeating patterns. Fields
with irregular edges hold a minimum of images, if any. Some artists
rely only on the texture and color of the yarn to evoke feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "Rug designers should have fun and show what's possible," says
Farr, who co-wrote the 208-page book with business partner Matthew
Bourne and Fiona Leslie, curator of the designs collection in the
prints, drawings and paintings department of the Victoria and Albert
Museum in London.</TE>
<TE>   Like his gallery in London, which counts Hugh Grant, Annie Lennox
and Ralph Fiennes as customers, Farr's Los Angeles space is simple.
The 1940s building on La Cienega has white walls, bare floors, big
windows and an empty fireplace. There is nothing to distract from the
rugs pegged to the walls.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery showcases the work of several other artists, many of
whom credit Farr with their success. Allegra Hicks, a textile and
fashion designer who uses variations of color tone to great effect,
has learned from Farr how rugs could be woven "the wrong
way"--lengthwise--to enhance the fluidity of her designs. In Hicks'
"Lotus" ($9,654), rows of linked flowers meander across a
9-by-12-foot field.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with Chris has been a wonderful experience in that he has
helped me develop my rug design vocabulary through his great
knowledge of traditional weaving technique," says Hicks. "The great
contrast between our design styles has also made him a perfect editor
of my work."</TE>
<TE>   A collection of silk rugs by abstract painters Brad Davis and
Janis Provisor occupies one of the two major rooms on the ground
floor. Unlike the other rugs in the gallery, these were not produced
by Farr's London-based company but by the husband-and-wife team's
Fort Street Studio in Hong Kong. "We respect these artists
tremendously," says Farr.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Provisor's "Fringe" ($15,120) has a sharp purple linear
motif interrupting a rich green field interlaced with lighter greens.
Wild silk, instead of Farr's preferred wool, gives the surface a
glistening, copper appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Art Begets Art</TE>
<TE>   A Farr rug begins with hundreds of sketches, mostly abstractions
of natural forms. He uses watercolors and crayons to experiment with
color and carefully considers fields where furniture might be
positioned without compromising the design. He slowly edits his
sketches down to the few he thinks will reproduce well onto a rug.</TE>
<TE>   Curves and amorphous shapes are difficult to duplicate in weaving,
which works off a strict back-and-forth, line-by-line grid. Farr's
"Guggenheim," inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's museum design, has
sweeping arcs, "making it extremely difficult to produce," says
Arabella Turner, a respected rug expert who worked for auction houses
in London and is now the Los Angeles gallery's director.</TE>
<TE>   Wool spinners, yarn dyers and weavers in Turkey can spend up to 20
weeks completing a rug to Farr's specifications. The soft yarn is
made the ancient way, with the fleece spun on a spindle by hand. Dye
colors are made from centuries-old recipes using bits of indigo (for
blue), madder root (burgundy), saffron (yellow) and walnut (black).
Natural dyes are durable and add an inconsistent yet highly appealing
richness to the surface. And, finally, skilled craftsmen hand-tie
thousands of knots onto the foundation and add the fine finishing
details.</TE>
<TE>   Arts patron Rebecka Belldegrun of Bel-Air, who attended Farr's
party and is furnishing her family's Modernist home designed by
Charles Gwathmey, is an example of buyers who have an elevated
attitude about rugs. "I love the muted colors," she says, studying
the gallery's collection. "They're warm, spiritual. And the rugs
describe some of the art I love from Sarah Morris and the Bauhaus
style."</TE>
<TE>   Farr, who lives in London with his wife, Valerie, and their two
boys, plans to return to Los Angeles every six weeks. "Interior
design is more of a dialogue here between the designer and the
client, and people are not as conservative" as they are in London,
says the designer, wearing a faded red T-shirt and a jet-lagged grin.
"They're not looking to duplicate a French chateau or a photo from
Architectural Digest. They don't want to do it the way their parents
did. They're loosening up, and it's exciting to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Farr galleries are at 748 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los
Angeles, (310) 967-0064, and 212 Westbourne Grove, London W11 2RH,
