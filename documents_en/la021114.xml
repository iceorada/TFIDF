<HD>Trip back in time with dinosaur Stan's stand-in at Cerritos

<LD>Say hello to "Stan" (or at least a copy of him), the Tyrannosaurus
rex found in South Dakota and excavated by staff from the Black Hills
Institute in 1992. He was named after Stan Sacrison, the amateur
paleontologist who discovered him. Stan is the largest and most
complete T. rex skeleton available to science. He lived during the
late Cretaceous period, about 65 million years ago.</LD>
<LD>   By studying the Earth, along with the fossil bones and plants,
scientists have been able to piece together a picture of what life
was like back then and how one of the largest carnivores to walk the
planet lived out his days. Here's what they think.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists believe that Stan lived his life in a family group.
Hatched from an egg (like a modern bird), he was cared for by his
parents. They taught him and his siblings to hunt. Eventually, Stan
left the family group and found a mate, a female 30% heavier than
himself and with whom he probably spent the rest of his life.</LD>
<TE>   Stan and his mate fought many battles with other animals during
their lifetimes. Each attack not only afforded the opportunity to
dine but also the risk of injury and competition. Stan's skeleton
shows the scars of ancient battles.</TE>
<TE>   A 40-foot-long, 12-foot-tall authentic fossil replica of Stan is
on permanent display in the children's area of the Cerritos Library.
A computer in the area's Learning Center is dedicated to dinosaurs,
with the story and a movie about Stan, a dinosaur book list, links to
dinosaur games and more. For information call (562) 916-1350 or visit
www.ci.cerritos.ca.us/library/childrens .html.</TE>

<HD>'The Big Griddle -- Just Like Home'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Schmul and the other Forbians apparently
need Albert's good luck piece -- a bit of scrap wood left over from
the birdhouse Albert and his father built. But Albert still doesn't
know what Schmul is going to do with it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mel Gilden</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert followed Schmul to the other end of the Big Griddle
restaurant, where a large machine stood. Albert had never seen
anything like it except in a science fiction movie.</LD>
<LD>   "This is our shield generator," Schmul said. "When we turn it on,
it will protect us from the Kreekem."</LD>
<LD>   "Then what do you need me for?" Albert asked.</LD>
<TE>   "Because a piece was missing. You made it and brought it to us."
Schmul lifted Albert's lucky piece with two fingers. He gingerly
dropped it into a hole in the front of the shield generator. It
seemed to fit exactly. "You and your dad were already working with
wood," Schmul continued. "Getting you to make a piece in a particular
shape was easy."</TE>
<TE>   Albert didn't like the idea of being manipulated by space aliens.
"You could make us do something really terrible. You could make us
hurt somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Schmul looked shocked. "Not at all," he said. "Even if we wanted
to do such a thing, which we don't, it is impossible. Humans cannot
be manipulated to do things against their own consciences."</TE>
<TE>   Albert felt a little better.</TE>
<TE>   "We thank you for your help," Schmul said. "But now you must go.
The Kreekem will be here soon, and we'll have to put up the shield.
Once we do that you won't be able to leave."</TE>
<TE>   "You're welcome," Albert said. "Now help me chose the right
postcard to get me home."</TE>
<TE>   "Very well," Schmul said, and he followed Albert to the back of
the dining room.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere a loudspeaker squawked.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kreekem are coming!" Schmul cried. "You'll have to choose
your own card. But whatever you do, you must hurry!" He shoved Albert
through the doorway into the little hallway outside the restroom.</TE>
<TE>   Albert studied the rack of postcards. Every one of them showed a
Big Griddle -- Just Like Home restaurant. Which one would take him to
his home?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will Albert choose the right postcard in time to make it
home?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>'Cucaracha' creator to draw syndicated comic strip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The creator of "L.A. Cucaracha" is going national with "La
Cucaracha," a rare Latino-themed syndicated daily comic strip, which
promises more fodder from the Spanglish, warped world of its main
character.</LD>
<LD>   Creator Lalo Alcaraz, 38, of Los Angeles signed a 10-year contract
with Universal Press Syndicate, which also syndicates "Doonesbury"
and "The Boondocks," to begin his biting and satirical strip on Nov.
25.</LD>
<LD>   Set in a "hyper-Boyle Heights" neighborhood, "La Cucaracha" will
use humor to address political and topical issues, such as
immigration, and will portray Latinos in a rounded and
multidimensional way, Alcaraz said.</LD>
<TE>   "L.A. Cucaracha" will continue in the LA Weekly, but Alcaraz is
considering changing its name to avoid confusion between the two
strips. "La Cucaracha" has been picked up so far by 35 newspapers
across the country, including the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate stuff that's watered down and not specific," Alcaraz said.
"The more specific you are when you create art, the more universal it
is. That's not what Hollywood does, but if I followed Hollywood's
advice I'd be doing a cartoon about a white man, and that's not
interesting to me."</TE>
<TE>   "Baldo," a Latino-themed comic strip by Hector Cantu and Carlos
Castellanos, has been distributed by Universal Press Syndicate for
the last two years.</TE>

<LD>   Butoh gets a jolt of rock</LD>
<LD>   In "Gig: Earthbeat 2002," feverish Japanese neo-Expressionist
butoh dancing meets contemporary electric rock energy in a
collaborative improvisation at the Electric Lodge Performance Space
in Venice. Award-winning butoh specialist Oguri works with jazz and
rock guitarists (G.E. Stinson the first weekend, Nels Cline the
second) to create a heightened sense of interaction that parallels
butoh's origins as a counterculture experiment in the late 1950s. If
you think that butoh has grown too pretty and Frenchified lately in
the hands of such groups as Sankai Juku (seen at UCLA in October),
watch it get back to its visceral origins in this two-weekend event.
Earthbeat workshops are also being offered through Nov. 24.</LD>
<TE>   "Gig: Earthbeat 2002," Electric Lodge, 1416 Electric Ave., Venice.

<TE>   Conceptual  look at cars</TE>
<TE>   There is a long-running joke in L.A. that we are what we drive,
therefore, it makes perfect sense that the Museum of Contemporary Art
is hosting what is being billed as the first comprehensive museum
exhibition devoted to the work of an American car designer. The
survey, "Retrofuturism: The Car Design of J Mays," opening Sunday at
the Museum of Contemporary Art at the Geffen Contemporary, examines
the work of Ford design chief J Mays, who was known for blending
fashion, architecture and industrial design into a car's concept and
its individual elements. The exhibition will feature concept cars,
development models, video footage, photography and drawings,
including the prototype for the new Volkswagen Beetle, the Audi Avus
and the new Ford Thunderbird.</TE>
<TE>   "Retrofuturism: The Car Design of J Mays," Museum of Contemporary
Art at the Geffen Contemporary, 152 N. Central Ave., Little Tokyo.
Tuesday-Sunday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m.; Thursday, 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Ends March

<TE>   "Standing in the Shadows of Motown" shines a light on the unsung
heroes behind the Detroit sound of the 1960s. The Funk Brothers -- a
group of virtuosic, jazz-bred session men, including bass player
James Jamerson -- provided the rhythm-laden music for hits by stars
such as Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations and Stevie Wonder.
Paul Justman's documentary tells their story and features
performances by the surviving funksters along with Joan Osborne,
Chaka Khan, Ben Harper, Bootsy Collins and others.</TE>

<HD>Giving in to the lure of Las Vegas, Nirvana</HD>
<DH>By plane or by car, the slots on the Strip await.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1995 film "Leaving Las Vegas," Nicolas Cage goes to Las Vegas
to drink himself to death. He decides to drive. He drives for the
finality of it, and probably because going to the Strip to kill
yourself just doesn't seem quite as romantic or metaphorical when
you're standing in line at the Southwest Airlines ticket counter at
the Burbank airport, holding a brownish placard that has the number
73 on it.</LD>
<LD>   How one chooses to get to Vegas, assuming it's not for suicide, is
often determined by pragmatism, like length of stay or a fear of
flying. But there are subtler forces at play, ones that can set the
tone for a weekend getaway before you even leave L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Lately, I've been flying more than driving, on the theory that I
don't want to have to deal with my car when I get there, and because
bargain fares make it all seem so easy and affordable.</LD>
<TE>   And to a large extent this is true. The happiest flights I've ever
taken are the ones that leave for Las Vegas on a Friday. Note the
merriment on the plane as would-be winners start their weekend early.
Laughter fills the cabin.</TE>
<TE>   When the pilot comes over the intercom to inform you that the
plane will be landing 10 minutes early, you remind yourself to shake
his hand as you disembark, to congratulate him on a job well-done.
Pilots, you tell yourself, should be thanked more often, as opposed
to taken for granted. Besides a handshake for the pilot will surely
establish good gambling karma through the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the pilot is in mid-conversation with a flight attendant,
and you don't feel like interrupting. Besides, you're distracted --
you can already hear the bells coming from the slot machines in the
terminal. They propel you forward, like being released into the wild,
after years spent huddled and wet in a cage.</TE>
<TE>   Note the bounce in your stride, the cut of your jib (whatever that
means). For me, nothing symbolizes the freedom to pursue red-blooded
American gluttony quite like landing in Vegas with an overnight bag
and a wad of cash, your everyday responsibilities (including your
car) garaged for the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The cab lines are quick. The cabbies, a multicultural group if
ever there was one, normally friendly. An hour ago, you were in L.A.
Now you're on the Strip, in all its improbable glory.</TE>
<TE>   The only trouble with flying is the return trip. Suddenly, all
those pals on the flight two days ago transform into these annoying,
blood-gorged beasts -- losers, winners, who cares? -- standing
between you and the sanctuary of home. That wonderful human being of
a pilot? Now he's telling you, sorry, folks, looks like it'll be
another 15 minutes here on the ground at LAX, until that other plane
vacates its parking space.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until recently, when I drove to Vegas solo, that I came
to appreciate the restorative pleasures of the round-trip hours in
the car. I hadn't done it in years, and I'd forgotten how much more
symbolic sense it made.</TE>
<TE>   Heading out of L.A., the weekend unfolds before you. The slow
approach into the desert seems almost biblical, the fast-food neon of
Barstow yielding to panoramic views of a landscape that seems
other-planetary.</TE>
<TE>   And then, of course, the moment of truth: Vegas, the city of sin,
suddenly reveals itself on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   The return trip, save for one caveat (L.A.-area traffic), offers
its own pleasures. After 48 or 56 hours amid the mass of humanity
that Vegas attracts, the car becomes a sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   The free-and-easy ability to move between L.A. and Vegas has made
the Strip a Southern California suburb, no less commutable than, say,
downtown to Hermosa Beach. To drive there is to understand that the
two places are worlds apart.</TE>

<HD>Scream leaves you dangling</HD>
<DH>A 'floorless' coaster will open at Six Flags Magic Mountain
in the spring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Niles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roller coaster fans have been watching eagerly as load after load of
blue and yellow coaster track arrived in Magic Mountain's parking lot
this month.</LD>
<LD>   Now Six Flags has confirmed the rumors: The park's 16th coaster,
Scream, will debut in the spring.</LD>
<LD>   Scream will be a "floorless" design from Swiss coaster builder
Bolliger &amp; Mabillard. On these coasters, riders sit in individual
seats mounted four-abreast above a steel tube track, with no floor
between each row.</LD>
<TE>   Scream will feature seven loops, a 150-foot initial drop, a
high-speed helix and a top speed of 65 mph.</TE>
<TE>   While Six Flags declined to release the cost of the new coaster,
similar floorless designs are priced at an estimated $15 million,
according to Roller Coaster Database, rcdb.com.</TE>
<TE>   Scream will join a handful of floorless coasters in this country
-- most notably the Medusa at Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo and
Kraken at Sea World Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   The attractions have proved to be popular with fans, particularly
aficionados, who give high marks to the floorless coasters for giving
them an unobstructed view of the ground below ... or, when
heels-over-head, the sky above.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like being strapped in a high chair. You're got
nothing underneath you," said Lance Hart, a coaster fan and editor of
Screamscape, a Web site that tracks coaster rumors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just you and the track, and it gives you some nice visuals,
especially in the front row."</TE>
<TE>   Six Flags hopes that visitors won't be screaming about long wait
times and shutdowns, which plagued Magic Mountain's last two
coasters, Deja Vu and X.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, floorless coasters are a proven design with a
reputation for reliability, according to Hart, which should go a long
way to preventing long lines and delays.</TE>
<TE>   For Six Flags, adding attractions -- particularly thrill rides --
is one of the key ways to attract people to the park. "Our guests are
pretty sophisticated," said Six Flags spokesman Andy Gallardo. "It's
important to provide new elements for them, and different types of
coasters. This [a floorless coaster] was really the missing link to
our coaster collection."</TE>
<TE>   Scream appears to be the only new thrill ride for 2003 at area
theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesperson for Knott's Berry Farm said the park has no plans
for a new coaster in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Disney plans to open a version of its popular "Tower of
Terror" free-fall ride from Walt Disney World at California Adventure
"sometime in 2004," spokesman John McClintock said.</TE>

<LD>Eminem's rare pop-culture daily double -- having the top-grossing
movie and the best-selling album -- continued Wednesday as the
soundtrack for his film "8 Mile" remained atop the nation's album
sales chart.</LD>
<LD>   Though the album debuted at No. 1 last week, many industry
observers felt the top spot would be taken over when new figures were
announced Wednesday by the first solo album from 'N Sync star Justin
Timberlake.</LD>
<LD>   But "8 Mile" sold 508,000 copies last week, easily topping the
439,000 sales of Timberlake's "Justified," according to Nielsen
SoundScan. The two-week total for the "8 Mile" soundtrack is 1.2
million.</LD>
<TE>   Other artists entering the Top 20 this week: U2 (No. 3), Jaheim
(No. 8), the Dave Matthews Band (No. 9), Andrea Bocelli (No. 12), the
Insane Clown Posse (No. 15) and David Gray (No. 17).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it's clear that neither the Elvis Presley nor the
Rolling Stones retrospectives will come close to the blockbuster
impact of the Beatles' "1" anthology, which has sold more than 8
million copies since its release in 2000. Both the Presley and Stones
collections have fallen out of the Top 15 after just a few weeks.</TE>

<HD>Their world of hurt</HD>
<DH>Almost anything goes in new extreme fighting league.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Verini</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever happened to that high school wrestling star, the one who
practiced chokeholds in the cafeteria? Or that kid down the block who
was always starting fights? And what about that linebacker in college
who got all the girls but never quite graduated?</LD>
<LD>   Chances are, their fates are dull. They ended up teaching gym or,
worse, becoming CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. But there is a slim
chance that one or two of them ended up in the Ultimate Above Ground
Fighting league, a never-never land for ex-bullies and barely
reformed keg-throwers everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   The league is holding its Extreme Cage Fighting Championship on
Friday at the Hollywood Palladium. (Note to dads: Don't bring the
family. In addition to copious amounts of blood, sweat and beers that
will soak the evening's seven cage matches, the actresses of
adult-oriented Wicked Films will serve as round signalers.)</LD>
<TE>   We caught up with the men of the league during a workout at the
Beverly Hills Jiu-Jitsu Club. On hand were Darrin Dotson, the mind
behind the as yet little-known league, as well as Mark "The Bear"
Smith and Chad "Battle Dome Warrior" Bannon.</TE>
<TE>   What exactly is it that appeals to Dotson about men in spandex
beating on each other mercilessly?</TE>
<TE>   "It's pure," Dotson, 37, said of the league, which allows
everything from Thai kick-boxing to Greco-Roman wrestling to
uppercuts. "A boxing match -- you watch it, and one guy obviously
won, but it goes to the other guy. But this is a sport where you get
your money's worth.... If you sit in the front row, you feel the
hits."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, Bannon and another fighter, Antonio McKee, were pacing.
They seemed eager to hit something.</TE>
<TE>   Dotson, a former minor league baseball player with the defunct
Valley Giants (he's also been an actor, club promoter and salon
owner) had always been a fan of violent combat sports. About 10 years
ago, he stumbled upon an Ultimate Fighting Championship match on
pay-per-view -- the championship is the major leagues of mixed
martial arts fighting, as the genre is known -- and fell in love. In
1999, after finding investors and persuading the California Gaming
Commission to take him seriously, he formed the league.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a club promoter in Hollywood for a while," Dotson said.
"The only difference here is that instead of sex and alcohol, it's
alcohol and violence." The women of Wicked Films notwithstanding, of
course.</TE>
<TE>   Smith walked over to a punching bag draped in a jujitsu uniform
and kicked it in the stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw these guys crawl into a steel cage and beat on each
other, I thought that was just the coolest thing," said Bannon, 31, a
lifelong athlete and casual brawler whose outsized physique and
glower give him the appearance of a G.I. Joe action figure. Bannon
originally came to L.A. to get into action movies (he played a red
ape soldier in the remake of "Planet of the Apes").</TE>
<TE>   As to the cage's cool factor, Smith agreed. "You're going to find
the true meaning of, of ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Of life," Dotson interjected.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Smith, whose legs and head boast numerous visible
scars. "Of what your body's capable of." A soft-spoken, 300-pound
former high school defensive tackle who looks more pastry chef than
action figure, Smith, 28, used to start street fights in his spare
time. Now he trains in Brazilian jujitsu and vents his wrath in the
cage. What's left he saves for unruly customers at the Candy Cat
topless bar, where he mans the door.</TE>
<TE>   McKee, a sprightly bon vivant who weighs half of what Smith does,
put Dotson in a headlock. Does he worry about bodily harm? "Look at
my face. I'm a beautiful guy," said McKee. "I don't get hit a lot."</TE>
<TE>   McKee, 32, is a former state championship wrestler who has owned
car stereo, video and carpet cleaning stores. "I lived the life of an
entrepreneur and made lots of money. But I felt like I was missing
something."</TE>
<TE>   McKee, who claimed he once trained by paying gangster friends from
his native Long Beach $500 apiece to fight him in his garage, has
high hopes for the league and himself: "It's going to take a big
organization to put a fight together for me to show the world what
I'm capable of."</TE>
<TE>   Dotson, who readily refers to himself as a "mediocre promoter" in
comparison with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is more
nearsighted but hopeful too. "Our first match was at a Marriott
hotel. Now we've got the Palladium, which holds 2,000 seats."</TE>
<TE>   "I look on it as a good thing that I'm doing," he continued.
"Without me, a lot of these guys would have nowhere to go."</TE>

<DH>Edward Tufte has spent his career fighting the visually
dull and flat. Even his sculpture is a leap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edward TUFTE lives in Connecticut, but among numbers nerds and
graphics gurus, he's better known as a warrior-preacher who travels
among dimensions, crusading for clearer thinking and better data.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-year-old Tufte (pronounced Tuff-tee) has made the study of
information design -- that is, the art of using images, numbers and
words to compress a three-dimensional world into two dimensions, on
paper or a display screen -- his life's work. As the author and
publisher of intricately illustrated volumes such as "The Visual
Display of Quantitative Information" and a professor at Princeton and
Yale for 32 years, Tufte has sold about 950,000 books and been
credited with doing for graphic communication what William Strunk Jr.
and E.B. White did for grammar in "The Elements of Style."</LD>
<LD>   But those exploits on the page and on campus are only part of the
reason why Tufte was standing on a bright orange ladder in a downtown
Los Angeles exhibition space last week, caressing a gleaming steel
slab as it reflected a string of halogen lights above. "I'm so
happy!" said the retired professor, beaming at the lights and their
metallic reflections. "It's like having 10 suns. Outdoors, there's
just the one."</LD>
<TE>   Tufte, a wiry, vigorous man with silver hair, a pair of pens in
his white shirt pocket and a tape measure on the hip of his jeans,
was here to help install "Escaping Flatland: Sculptures and Prints,"
an exhibition that opened Nov. 7 at the A+D Architecture + Design
Museum. The walls feature 22 oversized pages from his illustrated
books and examples of his favorite graphics, from a 9th century Latin
manuscript page describing and depicting the constellation Centaur to
a scientific illustration of a pink-finned fish from 18th century
Germany to a French skiing manual from 1947. The most striking part
of the show, however, is not the two-dimensional stuff, it's the
stainless steel in the middle of the high-ceilinged room. After four
decades of fastidious labor in the field of fact, the writer,
statistician and designer has taken up large-scale, 3-D, abstract
sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   The two stainless-steel works that dominate the modest museum
exhibition space (and will remain there until Feb. 13) are each about
12 feet high and 3,800 pounds. They are among 10 large-scale pieces
he has completed so far. Each is arranged in a series of planes, so
that they bounce light and soak up color from whatever surrounds
them. "I'm trying to do color and beauty, not irony or tortured
metal," Tufte said. "It's meant to be an intense, luscious
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Tufte, who shares 20 acres in Cheshire, Conn., with his wife,
graphic design professor Inge Druckrey, and three golden retrievers,
is a 1960 graduate of Beverly Hills High School. His late father was
head of public works for that city, and his mother, a professor of
English at USC for three decades, still lives in Beverly Hills. This
is Tufte's first exhibition in California, and only the second time
he has exhibited his sculpture. But he is no stranger to iffy new
enterprises. Tufte, who taught at Princeton from 1967 to 1977 and
Yale from 1977 to 1999, entered publishing in 1982, when an Ivy
League university press agreed to publish his first book, then told
him that someone else would design it and that the book would sell
for more than $64. Tufte had other ideas. He wanted control of the
design, and a lower price.</TE>
<TE>   Tufte enlisted the help of a seasoned book designer and
self-published "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" --
and priced it at $32. A second mortgage on his house paid for the
venture, even though the best interest rate he could get was 18.7% --
a particular horror for a trained statistician, but the strongest
possible incentive to market fiercely.</TE>
<TE>   It worked. "I knew within about six months that we had saved the
house," Tufte recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The Graphics Press (a.k.a. Tufte's garage and a nearby warehouse,
on the Web at www.edwardtufte.com) now sustains a staff of seven, and
has published two more illustration-rich Tufte tomes on information
design, with another expected next year.</TE>
<TE>   In those books, Tufte lionizes Galileo and Leonardo da Vinci as
perhaps the greatest analytical designers in Western civilization;
shows how a shrewd chart helped John Gotti's lawyers sway jurors by
showing the pattern of past felonies among witnesses testifying
against him; and posits that better graphics might have helped NASA
staffers, who were alarmed by technical glitches but couldn't get
their bosses' attention in their futile 11th-hour efforts to cancel
the disastrous Challenger shuttle launch.</TE>
<TE>   His specialty has been viewed as an ephemeral and secondary mode
of communication but Tufte, as reviewers of his books have written,
brings to it a scholar's rigor and broad view of historical
precedent. "Flatland" is Tufte's term for the two-dimensional page
and computer monitor. "Escaping this flatland," he has written, "is
the essential task of envisioning information, for all the
interesting worlds (physical, biological, imaginary, human) that we
seek to understand are inevitably and happily multivariate in
nature."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Martin, director of the fledgling A+D Museum and curator
of the exhibition, calls Tufte's work "a friendly compass in an
informational wilderness -- and, when necessary, a machete to chop
through thickets of disinformation."</TE>
<TE>   After two decades of experimentation with small sculptures, Tufte
said last week, he turned to these larger works four years ago,
relying on the Tallix Foundry in upstate Beacon, N.Y., to follow his
specifications. Stainless steel, he said, "is such a wonderful
material. It's forever. It's indifferent to the weather, it doesn't
oxidize."</TE>
<TE>   Like his graphics work, Tufte said, his art is about how a surface
is imbued with information -- in this case, light dancing on steel,
instead of ink fixed on paper. But as the artist is quick to say, the
sculpture only stands up to so much conversation. "I think a lot of
art chat is really reconstruction after the fact, trying to bring
words to something that is inherently not a very verbal experience,"
said Tufte.</TE>
<TE>   And what about Tufte's colleagues in number-crunching circles?
What do they think of all this? "I don't know," said Tufte merrily,
"and I don't care."</TE>

<LD>Sounds like the '60s? Could be Kennedy</LD>
<LD>   There is Kennedy the man and Kennedy the band, but they've become
basically the same thing: A local pop act with a silly sense of humor
and some seriously catchy songs. On the group's self-titled second
record, released last week on Sea Level Records, it's clear that
Kennedy (the band) spent some quality time listening to the Kinks,
Byrds and other mod superstars. The group's hooky songs are souped up
with such '60s accoutrements as syncopated hand claps, crazed
harmonica, vibratto organ, even "Deliverance"-style banjo. Kennedy
(the band), which performs tonight at the Three of Clubs in
Hollywood, just finished a monthlong residency at Spaceland, and
that's a long way from four years ago, when Kennedy (the man) was
living out of his van and recording music in the studio of the radio
station where he worked. He has since found not only his band but a
permanent residence in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Her debut is a do-over</TE>
<TE>   Singer-songwriter Charlotte Martin has been hearing the buzz for
some time. Before signing to RCA Records more than two years ago, the
26-year-old Martin recorded an independent CD, "One-Girl Army," which
got her national press in "Details" magazine, among other places.
Because of business complications, the CD was never released. Now
Martin, who moved to L.A. from Illinois almost three years ago, gets
a second chance at a first impression with her RCA debut, due next
spring. The delay isn't a bad thing though, as Martin says it's given
her time to get in touch with her goth voice. A self-proclaimed Cure
fanatic, she says, "If Kate Bush and Robert Smith [of the Cure] had a
kid and she played piano, it would be me." Martin plans to take a
couple of nights off from the studio to play around town before the
end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Happy to be here, indeed</TE>
<TE>   It's homecoming night Friday at the Derby for Britpoppers
Aberdeen, as well as the end of a long, strange road. The band, which
disintegrated in the mid-'90s after a couple releases on U.K.-based
Sarah Records, released the pop gem "Homesick and Happy to Be Here"
earlier this year. But a tour was, well, improbable, since during the
hiatus, vocalist Beth Arzy had moved to London and hooked up with the
Trembling Blue Stars. The problem was solved when Stars principal Bob
Wratten agreed to a dual tour -- his material getting acoustic
treatment. On the cross-country tour that ends Friday, Arzy did
double duty, lending backing vocals to Wratten and fronting Aberdeen,
which she co-founded with John Girgus a decade ago. "It was not as
hard as I thought it would be," Arzy said. "I mean, it was not as
grueling as doing the double shift at Denny's. I'm more relaxed with
the Trembling Blue Stars material -- I'm not real big on stage
presence, so I have to rock the Jack Daniels a bit before I can get
out in front."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Punk veterans Chip and Tony Kinman, co-founders of the Dils who
are now doing business as Cowboy Nation, have released a collection
of rough-edged, low-fi alt-country, "Cowgirl a-go-go." They open for
the Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash on Friday at the Mint.... Orange
County electronauts Channel warm up for Nina Hagen and ex-Bauhaus
bassist David J at the Key Club on Saturday night.... Stop at a local
Borders in the next month or so, and you're liable to see Gabriel
Mann, whose album "Tug of War" Was released last week. Mann's trio is
being promoted as part of a special program called "Under the Radar,"
a joint project by the chain and an independent A&amp;R firm.</TE>

<LD>McCain's tour</LD>
<LD>   First there were the police and their bomb-sniffing dogs. Next
came the Secret Service agents with their weird, curlicue earpieces.
Then a small army of rent-a-cops--all of them arriving hours before
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was scheduled to sign copies of his latest
memoir, "Worth the Fighting For," at Borders Books in Torrance.</LD>
<LD>   It was a lot of excitement for a bookstore, especially on a Friday
night, but with audiences as large as 1,300 at previous stops on
McCain's tour, his handlers were prepared. Extra Borders staff were
on hand to herd the crowd, and the signing area -- set up between a
CD rack and a display of 2003 calendars--was cordoned off with strips
of yellow "caution" tape.</LD>
<TE>   An hour before the reading, an ethnically and age-diverse group
was already forming to meet the maverick Republican senator, who
survived 5 1/2 years as a North Vietnamese prisoner of war in the
late '60s and who campaigned to be president three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Woodard was among those in line. Clutching a paperback
copy of McCain's 1999 memoir, "Faith of My Fathers," the 26-year-old
Torrance resident is a Democrat but likes McCain for his honesty and
"courage to go with the unpopular thing." Jorge Hernandez, a
31-year-old Republican from Santa Barbara, had bought both books for
the senator to sign. He's a fan because of McCain's willingness to
"fight for a purpose beyond self-interest." Three days after the
election, the line was buzzing with political talk as fans waited for
McCain to arrive. The politics were scheduled to continue with a
15-minute Q&amp;A once the senator took the stage, but McCain opted out
on the questions, choosing instead to immediately begin signing.</TE>
<TE>   He'd barely taken a seat when a woman, standing behind the yellow
tape, yelled, "Senator McCain. Will the man once known as the
Manchurian Candidate talk about his links to organized crime?"</TE>
<TE>   Booed by the crowd, she was asked to leave by the Borders staff,
and the signing continued without incident as hundreds of fans
streamed up to the stage one by one to offer their commendation and
support.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you run for president again."</TE>
<TE>   "Congrats on getting the majority."</TE>
<TE>   "I loved you on 'Saturday Night Live.' "</TE>

<LD>New sizzle at an old Crush</LD>
<LD>   Popped into the Sunset Room for some rainy night cheer and ran
into Eric James Virgets, the lovely nightclub's co-owner and a
Hollywood screenwriter. Virgets says he's gearing up to open White
Lotus in February, a sizzling dim sum bar and then some, at
Hollywood's old Crush Bar.... And speaking of crushes, we hear Keanu
Reeves was the last to leave Star Shoes' anniversary bash on Sunday,
which featured a dazzling array of DJs, including Z-Trip and Cut
Chemist ....</LD>
<LD>   Def Leppard turned out to cheer on L.A.'s favorite Irish punk
band, Flogging Molly, which took the Palace by storm on Sunday with a
1 1/2-hour set.... You won't find a cuter scene than Beat It!,
Sunday's youthful dance fest at the Ruby. Kids come from Riverside,
the South Bay, Orange County and Hollywood to partake of its retro
fun. The '80s-theme dance club is hotter than the King of Pop circa
'84....</LD>
<TE>   And speaking of hot, Club Synthetic, which moved from the 7969
club in WeHo to Club Echo last month, is so popular they had to shoo
people away on Friday. Tomorrow, the DJ-fashion-art collective Mount
Sims turns Synthetic out.... And while we're yapping about the Echo,
check out its new Monday night scene, Hot Coffey, a weekly fiesta de
funk.... Dragstrip 66, a monthly drag club at Rudolpho's in Silver
Lake, is plotting a blowout bash on Jan. 11, 2003, for its 10th
anniversary. If Saturday's send-up of the James Bond girls was any
indication, January's gay-la should be wild....</TE>
<TE>   "Glojob," a new Saturday night dance club at Dorscia (formerly
Moomba's) is off the hook and, speaking of Dorscia, we hear the
way-cool band Mellowdrone plans to take its soft-core sound to the
WeHo nightclub for a private show on Wednesday. Fans have to hold out
for their show at the Knitting Factory Nov 22.... The Lava Lounge's
"Kinky Karaoke" on Sundays nights is so bad it's good.... Tonight,
the Temple Bar in Santa Monica is celebrating the third anniversary
of its popular Thursday night club, Rhythm Room, with a performance
by the 55-piece hip-hop orchestra Dakah. Word....</TE>

<DL>Las Vegas</DL>
<LD>Las Vegas</LD>
<LD>   I was stalking entertainment on the Strip. By entertainment I
don't mean the strip clubs or the topless revues or even the sight of
a family of six, dazed and fatigued, standing on a people mover into
the Forum Shops at Caesars, like an alien abduction happening in slow
motion.</LD>
<LD>   I mean the big shows, the tourist shows, the shows that pass for
the best the Strip has to offer -- Cirque du Soleil's "O," Blue Man
Group, Clint Holmes, Danny Gans, Wayne Newton, Siegfried &amp; Roy. The
shows that are built, on the one hand, to wow Middle America and
timed, on the other, to provide compulsive gamblers with a place to
go for an hour or 90 minutes, sharp.</LD>
<TE>   The week I was in Vegas, the Cirque show "Mystere" at Treasure
Island was dark. Penn &amp; Teller had yet to commence a two-year run at
the Rio. Tom Jones was in town, which is never good for the faint of
heart. Darren Romeo, a singing illusionist ("He puts the music in
magic and the magic in music!") was opening an afternoon show in the
Siegfried &amp; Roy Theatre, produced by Siegfried &amp; Roy. There was a
press opening, which brought out Monti Rock III; he handed me his
card, which was hot pink and read "Piece of the Rock, Publicist to
the Stars." He was wearing a lot of leopard print and holding a
stuffed cat.</TE>
<TE>   Wherefore art thou, Romeo, these days? His show has already
closed. Poof. Vegas, after all, isn't that easy. Oh sure, the Rolling
Stones can pull in for a night at the Hard Rock, but could Mick
Jagger last a decade-plus, six nights a week, on the Strip?</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, over at the MGM Grand, Rick Springfield and "EFX
Alive!" will soon be toast, to be replaced by another Cirque show.
The MGM people (MGM Mirage Inc. has a monopoly of the big Vegas
hotels) wanted me to check out the Amazing Jonathan, the gross-out
magician who performs at the Golden Nugget downtown. He packs the
house! they kept saying. Downtown! I kept seeing him on an in-room
channel at the Mirage, seeming to saw his arm off.</TE>
<TE>   Magicians, I am sad to report, are somewhat lost on me. So I went
to see Wayne Newton. Sure, you could mock him as a relic, but have
you seen him turn a cover of "Suspicious Minds" into a 20-minute
free-floating exercise in Clintonian community relations? Have you
seen the way Medicare-eligible women throw their arms around him and
go in for the kiss, mouths first?</TE>
<TE>   Newton shook my hand during this furious, preacher-like tour of
his showroom and his cologne was on my palm for hours. This was
entertainment so real you could smell it, and as I sniffed my hand it
hit me -- this is why you see a show in Vegas, despite the prices.
You go to be dazzled, to see entertainers live and in the raw and
putting the show back in show business.</TE>
<TE>   You go, in short, to smell Wayne Newton on your hand.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, you can go whenever you want, quickly and conveniently,
as a proliferation of flights have turned Vegas into a virtual
Southern California suburb, an easier weekend getaway than fighting
traffic out of town (every day, there are some 75 scheduled flights
leaving Los Angeles for Las Vegas, if you include the four airports
in the area -- Los Angeles International, Burbank, John Wayne and
Ontario International).</TE>
<TE>   Hipsters like to go to the Strip with a sense of irony. They catch
Siegfried &amp; Roy as a meta-experience, an affirmation of their own
evolved sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   But this, it seems to me, defeats the purpose of seeing a Vegas
show in the first place. If you want to be smug, stay at home and
watch HBO. The TV and movie industries love to dress up their low-
and middle-brow entertainments as high culture. They phony up the
gravitas with phrases like "from the creators of 'Will &amp; Grace.' "
Vegas is the opposite of this. Its hype doesn't insult you. Vegas is
not from the creators of "Will &amp; Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Vegas is Sonny King and Blackie Hunt on a Friday night at the
Bootlegger Bistro, which is not on the Strip. The Bootlegger's in a
mini-mall next to a Thai restaurant and not so far from a mattress
store. It is owned by Lorraine Hunt, the lieutenant governor of
Nevada. I had been told to show up on a Friday or Saturday, between
10 p.m. and 2 a.m. I walked into a time warp. Sonny King played the
Sands in the 1950s. He sings, he emcees, he plugs the Bootlegger's
veal special. His partner, Blackie Hunt, the husband of Lorraine
Hunt, plays the melodica; he used to be part of a Vegas act called
the Characters. After midnight, Sonny and Blackie turn the stage over
to whoever wants to perform. The night I was there, Nancy Goode, a
local singer, yodeled, but only after singing "Ain't Misbehavin' "
(she was good at both). Buddy Greco, who has 65 records to his name,
introduced a jazz standard while shushing a table of loud bikers who
seemed to have wandered into the wrong movie. Over by the bar,
Lorraine Hunt said: "I've just been in Washington, dealing with
homeland security." It was way past midnight. That was when King went
up to Lorraine Hunt and, because no segue was needed, said:
"Lorraine, your hairdresser wants to sing."</TE>
<TE>   I was positive that the music at Bootlegger's was live, though the
same evidently can't be said of other shows. In a nod to the
Disney-fication of Vegas entertainment, some shows boost their sound
with pre-recorded music; a recent column in the daily Las Vegas
Review-Journal noted that "Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance,"
which closed recently at New York-New York, "was 'augmented' by the
recorded stomps of Irish step-dancing, the Strip's first case of
Highland fling-syncing."</TE>
<TE>   Musicians on the Strip lament the cost-cutting measures that have
made the "house orchestra" an anachronism, as hotel entertainment has
become less a source of artistic pride than an economic widget. The
philosophy behind this is simple: Big production shows are in vogue,
and audiences evidently don't care where the music is coming from, as
long as they can buy their T-shirts and hats to commemorate the
event.</TE>
<TE>   "We really don't have any shows worth over $50," says a cabby
taking me to the Flamingo Hilton. There, Gladys Knight has resurfaced
in a show that involves her hits. But only one Pip.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets to see Knight cost $55 and $65. Blue Man Group, the
blue-faced men who do pop-arty things with ordinary commercial
objects like a Twinkie, charge $69.50 and $79.50. "O," the circus on
water at Bellagio, costs $100 to $121. Siegfried &amp; Roy: a C-note.
Next year, pop diva Celine Dion will up the ante when she joins
forces with Franco Dragone, the Italian-born circus genius.
Celine-meets-Cirque debuts in the spring, in a new 4,000-seat theater
at Caesars Palace. Tickets are $150, $127.50 and $87.50.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's as simple as this: People come to Vegas to be
entertained, and Vegas exists to entertain and to gouge them. It is a
very simple transaction -- pleasing, in fact, for this very
simplicity. L.A. comedian Patton Oswalt, a regular Vegas visitor,
sums up the mind-set of the typical Strip customer this way: "The
plant could close, the kid could turn out gay. I want 48 hours where
I literally do not have to think about anything. The patrons are very
up front about it, and so is the city."</TE>
<TE>   Gambling, of course, is still the engine, but people on the Strip
are full of statistics about how non-gaming activities --
entertainment in all its various permutations -- have made Vegas a
playground for the middle class, and memories are never more than a
souvenir away.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth came in entertainment, and the evidence of the change
was everywhere," writes Hal Rothman, history professor at the
University of Nevada Las Vegas, in his new book, "Neon Metropolis:
How Las Vegas Started the 21st Century" (Routledge, 2002). Rothman's
list includes "the gradual upward creep in the price of buffet meals
and rooms, the proliferation of brand-name souvenir shops and the new
shopping conglomerations like Desert Passage at the Aladdin, the
ever-expanding number of stunning one-of-a-kind restaurants and the
upscale restaurant chains that follow in their wake, the new arenas
hosting never-ending music and shows and the escalating prices of
tickets to shows and concerts. Vegas still offers what it always has,
a luxury experience at a middle-class price."</TE>
<TE>   It seemed rude, finally, that I had been to Vegas so many times
without seeing Wayne Newton or Siegfried &amp; Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Before my trip, I sought out an expert in all things Vegas, Penn
Jillette, the speaking half of the bizarre magic act Penn &amp; Teller.
After living in New York for many years, through off-Broadway and
Broadway runs, after making a movie, after resurfacing on television
with a show called "Sin City Spectacular," based on the Strip, the
two have come to live in Las Vegas year-round. The land is cheap, the
airport links them nonstop to most places around the country and
Vegas seemed like a good place to die, Jillette said. That, and the
tax rate is low. You can see Penn &amp; Teller at the Rio for at least
the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Jillette talked of going to see Vegas shows in the late '80s and
of being brought to his knees when he saw Dean Martin live. "The
great thing was, he was the Ramones," Jillette said. Later, he
elaborated: Just as the Ramones took the idea of faster and louder
and pushed it to such an extreme that it became its own artistic
expression, so too did Martin push the idea of cool and relaxed
toward an end in itself.</TE>
<TE>   From there, it seemed a comedown to talk about Siegfried &amp; Roy.
"It's a fey tractor pull," Jillette said. "I like them."</TE>
<TE>   There is, indeed, something endearingly incomprehensible about the
show. There are lots of people onstage in fantastical costumes and
bombastic set pieces that include a fire-breathing dragon. A
good-versus-evil scenario is enacted; it helps to know that the
show's designer also designed "Cats." Siegfried &amp; Roy appear,
disappear, reappear. Tigers appear and disappear, though not with the
same frequency as Siegfried &amp; Roy. Later, my notes read: "Tigers
appear out of a liquid sky to protect and serve our precious
wildlife." I have no idea what this means. My notes also say,
"Velcome, Albuquerque," an apparent reference to some of Siegfried's
banter with the front row.</TE>
<TE>   True to Jillette's analogy, the show was as confounding as
watching two-wheelers haul heavy loads in the mud. Is it worth
seeing? Attempting to answer that question raises its own set of
questions. Yes and no. And yes again.</TE>
<TE>   "Las Vegas has not identified a paradigm within which all of its
shows can be judged," said Allan Feldman, senior vice present of MGM
Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman's comment proved a handy mantra over a dizzying nine shows
in eight nights, as I went from Blue Man Group at the Luxor (they
bang drums full of paint and project marshmallows onto a canvas, thus
creating art) to the Harrah's Clint Holmes, an affable
singer-entertainer gaining popularity, to Rita Rudner, who performs
her stand-up comedy at New York-New York, under the occasional rumble
of the roller coaster overhead, to "O," the spectacle on water.</TE>
<TE>   There is no paradigm. There is no paradigm.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Wayne Newton. He comes out to the strains of
"2001: A Space Odyssey," as a guy dressed in a spacesuit rises from
beneath ground and then gives way to Newton, in his tuxedo. He is
introduced as Mr. Excitement, as the Midnight Idol, as the King of
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Newton's voice is shot, you can't always understand what he's
singing, but then he turns "Suspicious Minds" into that 20-minute
tour de force. He gets champagne for couples celebrating
anniversaries, he talks about his travels as the newly named chairman
of the USO Celebrity Circle.</TE>
<TE>   There was the sign he saw on one of his military tour stops: "It
is God's responsibility to forgive Bin Laden. It is our
responsibility to arrange the meeting." Then he had all the veterans
in the audience stand and to be acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   He sweats. He tells the crowd how hot they are. He does a medley
of stuff: "Danke Schoen," "Unchained Melody," whatever. His hair
never moves. He's up there almost two hours. His bow tie is askew. He
is Wayne.</TE>

<LD>Mac King takes the stage in the Improv comedy club at Harrah's
Tuesdays through Saturdays at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. to perform comedy and
magic. In a town where big-name casino entertainment fetches unseemly
prices, a ticket to see King costs $16.45.</LD>
<LD>   King, in fact, may be the best deal on the Strip, in terms of
return for your dollar, provided you're willing to file into a club
in the middle of the afternoon. And while the hyphenate
comedian-magician conjures something potentially cheesy and awful,
King is both wry and winning, with his homespun humor,
audience-participation parlor tricks and genuine talent in
sleight-of-hand trickery. Don't be fooled by the loud plaid jacket.
For tickets to Mac King, call (702) 369-5111.</LD>

<LD>They've got the lights and the camera, but it's all about the action
at the Tinseltown Digital Video Film School, a hands-on,
seat-of-your-pants video class that teaches students how to film,
light, microphone, edit, title and score a short movie in one day.
Class size is restricted to six students, who work as a team, going
out in the field to collect raw footage, then return to class to
learn how to turn it into a movie.</LD>
<LD>   "The only way you learn is by doing," said Sheeraz Hasan,
Tinseltown's chief executive. "We say, 'Here's a camera. Here's what
you've got to do.' "</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't mean it's easy. In the field, students are,

<HD>The Edendale: Right now it's a mixed grill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than two years, chef Patti Peck and partner Melanie
Tesquellas have been meticulously restoring a historic Silver Lake
firehouse. Abandoned for 15 years, the bungalow-style L.A. Fire
Department Station 56 was built in 1924 when the neighborhood was
home to L.A.'s first permanent movie studios. Tom Mix, Charlie
Chaplin, Mack Sennett and the Keystone Kops, even D.W. Griffith
filmed in Edendale, just a mile south.</LD>
<LD>   In mid-October, Station 56 debuted as the Edendale Grill with Peck
as chef and Tesquellas as maitre d'. The space that was once the fire
truck bay now houses the massive Mixville bar, named after 1920s
cowboy star Mix's nearby western film lot. The 38-foot mahogany bar
has been thronged since opening day.</LD>
<LD>   Looking over the menu of American comfort food as we wait for our
table in the Arts-and-Crafts-style dining room, we're thrilled. So
much of it sounds appealing, and with prices on the inexpensive side,
the Edendale Grill seems like the right idea for the right place.
Peck, after all, used to own Millie's Diner in Silver Lake; she knows
what Silver Lake likes.</LD>
<TE>   First out is an order of onion rings. These are terrific, golden
and crunchy and not a bit greasy. But Caesar salad, made tableside,
is a disappointment. Though we saw an egg yolk slide into the salad
bowl, the dressing tastes more like a sharp, vinegary vinaigrette
than a true Caesar dressing.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of our meal is also spotty. I like the plump "heavenly"
crab cakes in tequila-lime sauce, but hickory-smoked pork riblets
suffer from a pallid ancho cherry barbecue sauce. Sand dabs come with
a lovely tartar sauce: Too bad the pretty little fish are so limp.</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, you can get half an herb-roasted free-range chicken with
lemon tarragon gravy for $12.75. And a prime flatiron steak for $17.
Once the kitchen gets up to speed, the Edendale Grill and its outdoor
patio could be a fine spot for supper. On Saturday nights, people are
already arriving in waves -- including a woman with interesting
Howard Hughes-length toenails painted like a Jackson Pollock.</TE>

<KH>My Favorite Weekend: Scott Spiezio</KH>
<HD>Heavenly haunts in the Southland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karla S. Blume</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In October, the rest of the sports world got introduced to the
lesser-known of our two Los Angeles-area baseball teams, the now
World Series champion Anaheim Angels. Scott Spiezio, the Gold
Glove-caliber first baseman, is one of those players with the "team"
mentality that got them the championship. Although he doesn't get
many days off during the regular season, he reflected on what he
likes to do in the Southland on the All-Star break.</LD>
<LD>   Splish-splash</LD>
<LD>   I have two boys, one is almost 3, the other is 5 months, so when I
hire a baby-sitter for an evening, I like to take my wife to Splashes
restaurant at the Surf &amp; Sand Resort in Laguna Beach. Because it sits
right on the beach, it's like you're on top of the waves. Dress is
casual, but you have to make reservations. My wife likes the seafood
there.</LD>
<TE>   We are also fond of P.F. Chang's in Newport Beach. They have
killer Mongolian beef. I usually get a few orders of it for myself. I
also like the BBQ-pork sandwiches and the heavy caffeine drinks they
serve in awesome jars at Lucille's Barbecue [in Brea]. If we couldn't
get a baby-sitter, then we might take our boys to Chuck E. Cheese for
some pizza and video games. My 3-year old likes the motorcycle and
car racing games best, but I prefer games like skee-ball.</TE>
<TE>   Love that Yoda</TE>
<TE>   I don't get to go to movies often, but when I do, I usually end up
at the multiplex theaters at Tustin Ranch. One of my favorite films
is "The Matrix." I can't wait to see the two sequels for it. I also
had to go see the new "Star Wars" prequels because I remember
watching the first "Star Wars" series when I was a kid. I didn't' t
like the new movies as much as the older ones, but I did like "Attack
of the Clones" better than "The Phantom Menace." It was great to
finally see Yoda kick some butt.</TE>
<TE>   Frogger</TE>
<TE>   Because I am such a music enthusiast, the concert I like attending
most is Ozz-fest. But I have my own heavy rock band called Sandfrog.
I write the songs, sing and play guitar for the band. The rest of the
band lives in Illinois, so it would be fun to fly them out to do a
show at the House of Blues Anaheim. I really like that venue because
it has a great atmosphere, a good sound system and it holds enough
people to have a good-size audience without feeling like you're in a
big arena.</TE>
<TE>   Of course I would have to have my large stash of guitars with me.
I have a couple of Fenders, a Les Paul and two Paul Reed Smith
guitars, one of which is custom-ordered with a tiger maple top and
has tadpole and Sandfrog skeletons inlaid on the fretboard.</TE>
<TE>   Bowl me over</TE>
<TE>   I used to play all sorts of sports for fun, but now because of my
contract with the Angels, I can't really do that anymore.</TE>
<TE>   I loved playing basketball, football, golf and especially hockey,
but nowadays I can't do much more than go bowling, 'cause if I got
injured, I would be in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   I have a relative who is a professional bowler so he gives me tips
on bowling.</TE>
<TE>   Home field advantage</TE>
<TE>   One of the perks of the Angels being owned by Disney is free
admission into Disneyland. My eldest son likes to ride on the teacups
as long as I promise not to spin him too hard. We also stop at the
Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride,
Snow White and Peter Pan. I'd say his most favorite attraction is
seeing the wild animals on the Jungle Cruise, but I also took him on
Thunder Mountain and he didn't even get scared. On the day of our
victory parade, Disney opened up Toon Town for us, but my kid was too
focused on chasing around the cartoon characters to ride on anything.
As for those good-tasting, bad-for-you food items, being the daddy
means buying popcorn, corn dogs and those massive rainbow lollipops
from Main Street.</TE>

<LD>Sit at the counter of Musso &amp; Frank Grill on Hollywood Boulevard and
it won't be long before someone calls out, "Hi, Manny!" One afternoon
it's City Councilman Tom LaBonge; another it could be Julia Roberts.
Manuel Felix has spent 29 years serving up Caesar salad, magic tricks
and sage advice.</LD>
<LD>   The back story</LD>
<LD>   The 65-year-old grandfather has lived in L.A. since 1957. A
widower for five years, he calls Los Feliz home and is proud to be a
"professional" waiter. "I do this thing well. I make you comfortable,
and I serve your every whim as long as it goes with the house rules."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Style</TE>
<TE>   The traditional Musso uniform: red coat, white shirt, black
trousers and black bow tie. Felix's fashion tip? Never leave home
without your smile. He never does.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Felix serenades diners with Perry Como tunes and old Spanish love
songs. But he is best known for his magic tricks.</TE>

moment's notice!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Best perk</TE>
<TE>   Meeting Hollywood greats like Steve McQueen, Telly Savalas and
Michael Landon. "As a little boy, Hollywood movie stars were figments
of my imagination. All of a sudden, I'm dealing with them across the
counter. That is beautiful."</TE>

<KH>THEATER REVIEW</KH>
<HD>An impressive 'Animal Farm'</HD>
<DH>Son of Semele Ensemble gives Orwell's fable currency with a
polished staging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Animal Farm" at the McCadden Place Theatre proves an impressive
outing for the Son of Semele Ensemble, an up-and-coming theater
company founded in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   In its short history, the company has gained considerably in
maturity and expertise. In contrast with the ensemble's somewhat
rudimentary early productions of "Lava" and "Breath," by Richard
Foreman and Samuel Beckett, respectively, "Animal Farm" is
gratifyingly polished.</LD>
<LD>   George Orwell's grim parable about a farm animal rebellion, and
the rise to power of a cunning pig despot, is often construed as a
polemic against the intrinsic evils of communism. As director Edgar
Landa points out in his program notes, Orwell most likely intended a
cautionary tale about the perils of voter apathy and an uninformed
electorate -- a warning particularly apropos today.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Hall's musical adaptation, which features undistinguished
lyrics and music by Adrian Mitchell and Richard Peaslee,
respectively, was produced earlier this season at the Theatricum
Botanicum, a much more spacious Equity venue. Landa deserves
considerable credit for confining the action to the sub-99-seat
McCadden's postage-stamp stage without impeding its flow.</TE>
<TE>   The excellent cast, spearheaded by the towering Michael Nehring as
the tyrant pig, Napoleon, is collectively capable, although an
occasional solo falls flat. Valiantly struggling with a
malfunctioning instrument, musical director and pianist Leo Meza
effectively marshals his performers, whose full-throated choruses
compensate for the paucity of accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   David T. Edwards' picturesquely battered set, Chris Greulach's
brooding lighting and Al Sgro's cacophonous sound set the dystopian
tone. Huge masks, designed by Deborah Bird, are strapped atop the
actors' heads like helmets. When the actors tip their heads down,
their faces are completely obscured. Handsome and magnificently
constructed though they may be, the masks prove an emotional barrier
between the audience and the actors. One yearns for these performers
to raise their chins and reveal the human expressions.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in his grad student days at Cal Arts, L.A.-based artist Dave
Muller began throwing together one-day shows in his studio. He would
put up his drawings, buy some beer from Costco, spin some records,
invite a bunch of friends over.</LD>
<LD>   At these party/exhibit hybrids everybody checked out the art and
had a good time. "It felt like the workers got the keys to the
factory and could make whatever they wanted. Kinda like punk rock or
something," Muller says.</LD>
<LD>   The innocence of that approach remains intact to this day, 8 1/2
years later, even though Muller's bashes, dubbed Three Day Weekends,
have since evolved into full-fledged social events on the arts scene
-- movable feasts of art, music and all-around good vibes that have
traveled from various So Cal locales to places including Malmo,
Sweden; Tokyo; New York; and the belly of a freight elevator in
Frankfurt, Germany.</LD>
<TE>   In one memorable instance, Muller's friends staged a
Dave-Muller-in-Absentia Weekend, opening his downtown L.A. loft while
he was away and inviting people to come in and turn his possessions
into objets d'art: "They did drawings of my bed, my record
collection, my clothes, even my underwear," Muller recalls.</TE>
<TE>   This illustrious track record was augmented Sunday when Muller,
whose selected works are on display at UCLA's Armand Hammer Museum in
the "Dave Muller: Connections" exhibit, put on another of his
signature shindigs in the museum courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   The air was balmy and a lovely breeze rustled the still-green
leaves of maple trees in the courtyard -- possibly nature's
unintended pun on a series of drawings titled "As if There Were
Seasons in L.A.," which Muller provided for the cover of Hammer's
fall catalog.</TE>
<TE>   The galleries stayed open throughout the night, allowing the
visitors a free peek at Muller's and other artists' exhibits.
Muller's show consists of mostly handmade replicas of direct-mail
pieces for his artist friends' shows, posters advertising art
exhibits, articles on art, even subscription coupons from magazines.
The reproductions are rendered in intricate detail in ink, acrylic
paint, pencil and even makeup glitter, and are in subversive
opposition to the slick marketing materials that inspired them.</TE>
<TE>   There was more fun to be had in a corner of the darkened Hammer
auditorium, where photographer Patterson Beckwith had set up a photo
studio. About 20 volunteers waited in line to have their picture
taken in front of a black background with a special film Beckwith
exposed twice to create surreal images. The plan is to blow up
selected prints over the next two weeks and annex them to Muller's
exhibit.</TE>

<HD>A mix master</HD>
<DH>Jeremy Blake's blend of genres is attracting notice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeremy Blake's digital art is painting made animate, color and
pattern transformed from stagnant image into slow, liquid, meditative
motion. Working initially with ink and gouache drawings (and at times
sketching directly onto the computer), Blake manipulates his work
into dreamlike DVD animations. Using a combination of traditional
mediums and technological know-how, he creates a fascinating
cross-pollination of painting and film, visual exploration imbued
with a subtle cinematic narrative that most recently served as visual
interpretations of experience and emotion in the film "Punch-Drunk
Love."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm trying to use the same philosophies as painting," says Blake,
who will participate in a panel discussion, "Neither There nor Here,"
on the shifting definitions of film and art, Tuesday night at the
Santa Monica Museum of Art, "but allowing for that sensibility to
migrate to other places."</LD>
<LD>   After attending at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago,
Blake moved to California in 1993 to attend the MFA program at the
California Institute of the Arts. At CalArts, his focus first shifted
away from traditional English figure painting as he became seduced by
the aesthetics of experimental film and video.</LD>
<TE>   "I was fascinated with film's ability to tell a story over time,"
Blake says. "I thought that would be a new and interesting route for
abstraction, trying to bring to film the 2-D logic of painting. The
core of the work is in drawing and the spatial logic is from
painting. But then there's this sense of traveling through space
without ever moving."</TE>
<TE>   It was this aesthetic that first attracted filmmaker Paul Thomas
Anderson, who saw Blake's work two years ago in a San Francisco
museum. "He had been messing around with the idea of some color
changes to demonstrate what the character was experiencing in the
film he was working on, 'Punch-Drunk Love,' and when he saw my stuff,
he called me up," says Blake.</TE>
<TE>   The result of their work can be seen in graceful interstitial
animations throughout the film, moments of visual abstraction that
link the linear narrative, lending mood and emotion through color and
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's work outside the traditional artistic establishment has
also included a recent collaboration with the musician Beck, who
enlisted the artist to add his distinctive imagery to the four covers
of his newest album, "Sea Change." Beck is also using edited versions
of Blake's DVD work as a visual accompaniment to his live shows.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success as a visual artist (Blake's work has appeared
in numerous galleries and museums throughout the world, including the
Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and at the Whitney Museum's
Biennial), Blake is unapologetically pleased by what he does within
more commercial mediums.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this idea that you've sold out somehow by working outside
the traditional establishment," says Blake, "but any time you face a
little adversity, it probably means you're doing something right. I
think Beck and Paul came to me because they felt I could communicate
something they had in their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "All three of us have something in common, which is that as
artists we're all looking at previous generations and kind of rifling
through the files of history, trying to find something that matches
how we feel.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the same time as we're inspired by our sources, we're
still trying to do something totally new."</TE>
<TE>   Blake's work can be seen locally at the Museum of Contemporary Art
in San Diego (through Nov. 27) and at the Santa Monica Museum of Art.</TE>

<HD>Warming up to fuzzheads</HD>
<DH>Janell Cannon uses animals, real and imagined, to address
emotional themes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Janell Cannon loves animals so much she has invented her own species.</LD>
<LD>   The children's book author and illustrator whose bestseller,
"Stellaluna," helped kids understand more about bats, will read from
her new book, "Little Yau," Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Every Picture
Tells A Story gallery in Santa Monica. Her latest story continues a
series based on the fuzzheads, a feline-like animal that sprung from
her imagination in the '80s.</LD>
<LD>   "They were in my mind's eye and wouldn't go away," said Cannon.
"So I was compelled to develop them. I did large color pencil
pictures and suddenly began to realize the history, the personalities
and where they lived. Soon there was this sentient race of feline
creatures. They were sophisticated and literate and they had the
ability to use herbal medicine. And all kinds of things began to
unfold. So, before a book was published I had a whole world in my
head."</LD>
<TE>   The texts lend themselves to the spoken word, said David Holt, who
made a Grammy-winning recording of "Stellaluna."</TE>
<TE>   "Her writing is simple but not childish," Holt said. "That's the
beauty of it. And it's got a lot of life to it. It's concise and
precise but never talks down to children. It's got just the right
tone."</TE>
<TE>   The world of the fuzzheads began with Cannon's book, "Trupp." That
title character reappears in the new book, but this time he's been
poisoned; Yau and friends come to his rescue.</TE>
<TE>   The stories are aimed at addressing emotional/spiritual themes,
with one of Cannon's central tenets: the idea that we're not alone on
the planet. "Every species is connected in an ecological web," she
said, describing the subtext woven into her tales, "and if we close
out other species it will eventually threaten us."</TE>
<TE>   Her message comes wrapped in a colorful package. A largely
self-taught artist, Cannon creates illustrations that are richly
detailed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have vivid memories of what captured my imagination when I was
a child; flat abstract illustrations didn't grab me. The ones that
did were full of depth."</TE>
<TE>   A former librarian, Cannon has organized award-winning reading
programs and loves interacting with children even though she admits
she's fundamentally shy.</TE>
<TE>   "I just go in with what I have to offer, nothing more, nothing
less. If you go in with affectation the kids will know it. I
genuinely appreciate kids and their unique perspective and I believe
in what I'm doing and I come in and if what I say is of interest to
them, they'll listen."</TE>
<TE>   Storytelling can strike a chord with kids of all ages, Cannon
said. "Even with computers and TV they haven't lost that interest in
sitting and listening to stories. Even middle school kids, when
they're not around their peers, like listening to bedtime stories."</TE>

<LD>An engaging  'Twelfth Night'</LD>
<LD>   Sophisticated enough for adults, with a story and humor that can
engage children: "Twelfth Night," family style, opens Saturday at the
Geffen Playhouse in Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   Shakespeare's gender-bending romantic comedy about a shipwrecked
young woman who disguises herself as a duke's page -- then falls for
the duke while his intended falls for her masculine persona -- is
presented by Parson's Nose Productions as part of the Geffen's
"Saturday Scene" family series.</LD>
<TE>   "Twelfth Night," with its romance, confusion of mistaken
identities, physical humor and pinpricked pomposity, is a natural for
family audiences, said Lance Davis, leader of the 2-year-old
professional company.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about a strong young woman that Shakespeare has put through
a trial of fire before the play even starts, and so she sees what is
true and worthwhile in life. I have a 12-year-old daughter, and
that's a wonderful message."</TE>
<TE>   "Twelfth Night," Geffen Playhouse, 10886 Le Conte Ave., Westwood,
Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. Adults, $5; children, $1. (310) 208-6500, Ext.
198.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Covert jazzes up family entertainment</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Ralph Covert is a rock artist turned kids' performer
with an irresistibly unexpected approach to family music, and his
third children's album is another original mix of pop and jazz
rhythms and soulful and wildly inventive lyrics, including songs
about a trombone-playing dog, an escalator-riding alligator, a
car-fetching pet dinosaur and a scatting "Betty Botter."</TE>
<TE>   Covert will perform at Storyopolis on Saturday, presented in
conjunction with a "Passport to Reading" event for ages 3 and up.</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Lemons," Ralph Covert. Waterdog Music/Mini Fresh. CD:

<LD>   War Music -- In a haunting presentation by Playwrights' Arena and
the Echo Theater Company at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, Bryan
Davidson's play suggests that the truest counterbalance to war's
destruction is to go on creating. The story is divided into
movements, each inspired by the life of a composer: Frank Bridge,
Anton Webern and Olivier Messiaen. The first charges into a firefight
in which a soldier, a pianist, loses an arm, prompting "Three
Improvisations for the Left Hand." The final movement is inspired by
"Quartet for the End of Time," which Messiaen wrote while a prisoner
of war.</LD>

<LD>I agree that trying to meet people in Los Angeles is really difficult
(Single in the City: "In matters of love, he cuts to the chase," by
Maria Elena Fernandez, Nov. 7). Where is the romance and magic in
this town?</LD>
<LD>   It seems that most single women either have an agenda or, like
you, are on a "break." You would think that with so much romance that
L.A. has to offer, you would have more hopeless romantics wandering
the streets in hopes of finding that person you can share crepes with
at Farmers Market on a Sunday morning. I'm from New York, and it
seems to me that destiny is a lot more comfortable working its magic
in the Big Apple's subways than on the Third Street Promenade.</LD>

<TE>   After having spent significant amounts of time traveling

life overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago I traveled alone to Europe and spent 2 1/2 months
visiting Spain, France and Italy. I just returned from staying at the
homes of the friends I made two years ago. Friends who opened up
their lives, homes, hearts, friends/families, and so much more to an
unknown American traveler. I have learned from them that there is
another way to live, not based on "money, ambition or celebrity," as
you mentioned.</TE>

<TE>   Is The Los Angeles Times so hard up for ideas that it is willing
to pay someone to re-create what aspires to be an opening monologue
from the HBO series "Sex and the City"? I mean, how much more obvious
could you be? Naming it "Single in the City"? For Pete's sake, the
"author" even mentioned a Sarah Jessica Parker movie: "L.A. Story."
The least you could have done is thrown in something at all original.</TE>

<LD>Onion soup: classic charms</LD>
<LD>   The onion soup at Pleasant Peasant, a charming French spot, is
based on beef stock simmered for five hours, loaded with carrots and
celery as well as onions fried golden. It's topped with a toasted
slice of baguette covered with Swiss cheese, and the bowl is put
under the broiler until the cheese begins to bubble. (French onion
soup, $4.95.)</LD>

<KH>A NIGHT AT KING KING</KH>
<HD>A local twang</HD>
<DH>At King King, a monthly country event is a surprise
success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King King and country? It's true. Each month, the club is home to a
good old-fashioned Hollywood honky-tonk replete with beautiful babes
and cowboys, pretty boys and cowgirls, and is about as authentic as
anything in Hollywood can be.</LD>
<LD>   The monthly Eastbound and Down night -- the brainchild of actress
Joey Lauren Adams, who promotes it with her friend Victoria Vaughn --
is turning into one of the most popular musical nights at the
reincarnated club. Two hundred to 300 closet country fans party until
the wee hours on the third Sunday of each month to the sounds of
Eastbound and Down, a concocted band made up of some of the most
talented singers and musicians in the city's emerging country music
scene.</LD>
<LD>   "Like all transplants here, we leave our hometowns to get away
from it all, but then we find the longer we're here, the more we want
to cling to our roots," said Adams, who grew up in Arkansas and is
best known for her lead role in the film "Chasing Amy." "I used to go
to the old King King for the blues and the ska, and I knew there was
a great opportunity here for a great musical night. What's cool about
a honky-tonk in the South is that you don't get that
too-cool-for-school atmosphere."</LD>
<TE>   King King, a La Brea Avenue music lover's paradise that closed its
doors in 1993, reopened in April in a historic brick French
chateau-style building at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and
Whitley Avenue. Owner Mario Melendez helped construct the one-room,
red-tinged venue, which offers live blues, Latin and rock music. He
gave Adams a chance to throw her party five months ago to see if she
could attract 50 patrons. Adams delivered that many -- times five.</TE>
<TE>   "I like all forms of music, but when she asked me why I didn't
have a country music night, I told her I didn't have the expertise
nor the time to develop one," Melendez said. "It's turned into one of
the best nights we have here. There are a surprising number of people
in Los Angeles who are into that music."</TE>
<TE>   The success, fans agree, is due to the raw talent of the band --
Keith Gattis, Waylon Paine, Travis Howard, Mitch Marine, Lucas
Cheadle and Chris Lawrence. The bandmates, who set aside their
individual alt-country careers to come together for this one night a
month, play only 1970s cover songs, like "Dinosaur" and "Eastbound
and Down," and sing with surprise special guests like Dwight Yoakam.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really the leading edge of this alternative country
movement which hasn't been named yet," said Margot Hamilton, who is
producing a documentary about Gattis and Paine. The special guests
are a way of giving fans something new to look forward to each month,
said Vaughn, whose brother, actor Vince Vaughn, has attended the
party.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Tate, 56, a native Texan who proudly displays the 1982
bull-riding championship emblazoned on his belt buckle, is a fixture
at the honky-tonk because he feels a kinship with the band.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the music and the fact that there's no line dancing here,"
he said while drinking some whiskey. "I believe that if you dance
with a woman, you should be holding her. This is a little Hollywood,
because where I'm from everybody wears boots and hats and long-sleeve
shirts. But I enjoy this."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Eastbound and Down crowd is part hard-core country and
part industry hip; (white and black; lean and overweight; young and
old, which is how Adams and Vaughn want it. There is no velvet rope,
no guest list and no VIP area. "If you're not playing, you're
paying," Vaughn said. The $7 cover charge pays for the band.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't been that cool recently to be a country music fan, but
it's starting to be more in vogue now," said Howard, who plays rhythm
guitar and helped Adams put together the band. "This has turned into
a community thing."</TE>
<TE>   "I love the guys in the band," said a 50-something Mexican
American woman who would only give her first name, Ana. "They have
beautiful voices. But they also have beautiful bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Which is something Alabama native Charlie Terrell, a country and
blues singer in the audience, noticed too. "I have a problem with the
singer in the middle," Terrell said. "Nobody has those kinds of abs.
All those boys could be on the cover of magazines. A real honky-tonk
is about racism, misogynistic behavior and drinking. It's not a real
honky-tonk unless there's a minimum of five fights. And there would
never be this many good-looking girls. But at least the sound is the
real thing."</TE>
<TE>   The night is dedicated to traditional country music, so the band
does not play originals. "We pay respect to a style of music we
appreciate and admire," Gattis said. "What's cool is that we're
playing honky-tonk in the middle of Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   To find out how intoxicating the music can be, follow Melendez,
who grew up in East L.A. According to bartenders, it's becoming
common for the boss to drive up to work in his '65 red Chevy pickup
truck blasting "Rhinestone Cowboy."</TE>

<HD>Nobody's rules but his own</HD>
<DH>Cody Chesnutt defies definition, and if that makes some
folks uncomfortable, well, so be it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crowd at the Temple Bar in Santa Monica has been seriously
grooving to the mix of soul, R&amp;B and rock being played by Cody
Chesnutt and his band, but now the listeners are getting impatient as
a break between songs drags on and on. "Just sing!" shouts one man in
the audience. Maybe he's heard that Chesnutt can be a little, well,
odd, but he probably didn't expect to be watching the star of the
show carefully setting up a typewriter on stage.</LD>
<LD>   Chesnutt seems unperturbed as he patiently positions the machine
and finally begins his ballad, "Love Don't Be Wrong (Not This Time),"
tapping the typewriter keys to portray a man writing a love letter.
Just like that, the crowd is back in Cody's corner.</LD>
<LD>   "It's my song, it's my music, if I'm having fun expressing it with
a typewriter, who can say that I can't," Chesnutt says later when
asked about the episode. "True artists know there is no rules."</LD>
<TE>   Words to live by. Chesnutt has disdained musical and cultural
restrictions since he started cobbling his distinctive musical vision
as an teenager in his hometown of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Consider his recent emergence, in which the singer, songwriter and
multi-instrumentalist displayed a remarkable facility for getting his
face and name into the music public's bloodstream far in advance of
his first album's release last month.</TE>
<TE>   There was his guest spot on the summer's Smokin' Grooves concert
tour with the Roots, the acclaimed Philadelphia rap group that has
recorded his song, "The Seed," for its upcoming album.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing tops his memorably bizarre appearance with the Strokes
during the latter's performance on MTV's "Two Dollar Bill" concert
program, where Chesnutt climbed on stage with the New York rock band
and stood with his scarf-draped arms spread wide, beaming
beatifically behind singer Julian Casablancas as they played their
hit, "Last Night."</TE>
<TE>   "I just happened to be at the taping," recalls Chesnutt, sitting
in an alcove at the Zen nightclub in Silver Lake, where he's playing
a show in a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing his trademark round-topped hat and a white scarf with
bands of the Jamaican tricolor red, green and yellow, he has an easy
charisma and a wide-eyed sincerity. He's a little subdued after
driving from Las Vegas, where he performed last night, but his speech
has a fast, urgent cadence as he continues the story.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Wow, this is MTV, the most powerful music network on
the planet, I'm tired of the stuff they show, let's give them
something new to see.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I went up to Julian and I said, 'You want to make music
history together?' And he was like, 'How do we do that?' I said,
'Bring me up on stage, man and let's celebrate your single "Last
Night" together. He said, 'OK, cool,' called me up. Simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Simple as that. The fact that Chesnutt had never met the Strokes
is just one indication of his brashness.</TE>
<TE>   Another is the nature (not to mention the title) of his album:
"Headphone Masterpiece." It's a two-disc set running 100 minutes, an
unruly, effervescent landscape of old-school soul, garage rock,
psychedelic pop, quirky folk and a dozen more musical strains,
primitively recorded on four-track in his bedroom studio in North
Hollywood. Its disarmingly blunt lyrics struggle with the age-old
conflict between the spirit and the flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Border-bashing comes naturally to Chesnutt, 34, who grew up in an
Atlanta household filled with many styles of music, from classical to
KISS. He started playing drums at 7 and then took up piano, and later
guitar. After moving to Los Angeles he fronted a group called the
Crosswalk, but things went sour with its label, Hollywood Records,
and its album never came out. It was a shattering and defining
experience for Chesnutt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same old disaster story," he says. "You put all your
heart and soul into a record and it gets tossed aside as a tax
write-off or whatever.... I came out extremely educated and focused.
Because I'm human, the disappointment had its effect on my heart, but
nonetheless it inspired me to push even further.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't gonna let that kill my flame. There was a point of
redirection and just kind of sortin' it out, but it didn't stop my
determination.</TE>
<TE>   "I was extremely enlightened about how not to put so much of your
life into another man's hands, and not to trust him so much."</TE>
<TE>   That's when Chesnutt withdrew to his studio and began to piece
together "Headphone Masterpiece," following only his rules.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only way," he says. "That's the only way you truly
create. You just plant your own seed, make sure you see your vision
through completely."</TE>
<TE>   Now that the artist-to-watch buzz is on and the album is out (on
his own Ready Set-Go! label), and with some Erykah Badu dates booked
for January, it looks as if the campaign is ready to roll.</TE>
<TE>   Look again. As far as Chesnutt is concerned, it's over.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, I already consider myself a success as an
artist," he says. "Everything else is extra, a blessing. I'm doing
what I love to do. So if it gets to 2 billion people, that's fine.
I've played in front of two people, I've played in front of 10,000.
It's at the point now where it's on its own path, it's on its own
frequency."</TE>
<TE>   Chesnutt takes pride in reclaiming a piece of rock 'n' roll for
black artists, but most of his attention is on the bigger musical
picture.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to change the face of what the whole thing's supposed to
be right now. Music has gotten to the point where it's ridiculous.
It's so watered down, there's a cookie-cutter, assembly-line, factory
feel to it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing truly pushing the people or touching them. Even
if it is raw and blatant, there is no constructive passion. Truly
talking to people about what they're going through in their daily
lives, really trying to figure it out and sort it out, that's what we
need in the dialogue now."</TE>

<LD>   If you're into Bob Dylan enough to follow his set lists faithfully
on the Internet, you're just the kind of cultist who is going to want
to be at the University of Judiasm in Bel-Air on Saturday night.
Mickey Jones, the drummer on Dylan's 1966 world "electric" tour, will
host a screening of the documentary he has put together from
8-millimeter home movies he took during the tour.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Beware</TE>
<TE>   Jones is no D.A. Pennebaker, the director of "Don't Look Back,"
the classic '60s documentary. Jones' documentary is drawn from the
kind of very ragged silent movies that people made before the arrival
of the video camera. And there's not a lot of Dylan in it -- on stage
or off. Like most travelers, Jones spends lots of time photographing
the fronts of hotels and venues, with some tour bus footage and band
high jinks thrown in. The 91-minute film (available on DVD through
www.1966tourhomemovies.com) supplements the Dylan tour material with
footage from Jones' earlier gigs with Trini Lopez and Johnny Rivers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So why care?</TE>
<TE>   There's something charming in Jones' lighthearted narration about
Dylan and the times that is a refreshing break from all the scholarly
discussions of the man who is rock's greatest songwriter. The chances
are Jones will conduct a question-and-answer session after the
screening, so that could be fun.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bonus</TE>
<TE>   After "1966 World Tour, the Home Movies," Jones will sit in on
drums with what is billed as the only Dylan tribute band, Highway 61
Revisited, to reenact Dylan's famous 1966 Manchester, England,
concert. Joel Gilbert will portray Dylan.</TE>

<LD>Singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell says her new "Travelogue" album, due
Tuesday, will be the final destination on her three decade-plus pop
music journey.</LD>
<LD>   The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer tells W Magazine in its December
issue that her disgust with the music industry's relentless pursuit
of trendiness has prompted her to give up songwriting. "What would I
do?... Get hair extensions and a choreographer?" she asks in the
interview. "It's not my world."</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell has previously expressed her desire to channel her
artistic energies into the painting she has always done in addition
to her music. "Travelogue" is a double CD consisting of orchestrated
arrangements of her songs with appearances by jazz musicians
including Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter.</LD>

<LD>Returning the Elgin Marbles to Greece would rip the heart out of a
collection that tells the story of human civilization, the British
Museum said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a riposte to the latest efforts by Greece to repatriate the
classical sculptures from the Parthenon, the museum rejected
proposals to send them back on a long-term loan. Greece wants to have
the Marbles back as the centerpiece of a new museum at the Acropolis,
being built to coincide with the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens.</LD>

<LD>A rare instrument by the world's most celebrated violin-maker,
Antonio Stradivari, fetched $966,000 from a private collector at a
London auction Wednesday, short of what Christie's had expected.</LD>
<LD>   Dating from 1726, the violin is just one year older than the
Kreutzer Stradivarius, which at $1.5 million still holds the world
record as the most expensive musical instrument ever sold at auction.
Unlike some of its sister instruments, however, this one does not
have a particularly colorful history because it was never owned by a
professional violinist or played in a public concert. Instead it has
been owned by a series of professional collectors.</LD>

<HD>Picking queen can be a royal pain</HD>
<DH>Eccentric, rowdy contestants strut their stuff for Doo Dah
Parade officials -- and for the cameras.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roy Rivenburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picking a queen for Pasadena's wacky Doo Dah Parade is like a cross
between the Miss America pageant and "The Gong Show."</LD>
<LD>   This year's hopefuls included a Britney Spears impersonator in
drag, an inflatable doll, a 62-year-old woman using an oxygen tank
and a dachshund whose hind legs had been replaced by a two-wheeled
cart.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the spectators were also off-kilter. A man dressed as
Uncle Fester on "The Addams Family" strutted around with glowing
lightbulbs sprouting from his mouth and a mechanical hand flopping on
top of his head.</LD>
<TE>   The event unfolded Tuesday night at the Zorthian ranch in
Altadena, a 45-acre hilltop property littered with eccentric
sculptures, rusting jalopies and the occasional rubber chicken. Ranch
owner Jirayr Zorthian, an elfish 91-year-old, served as one of the
pageant judges. Joining him on the panel were radio host Dr. Demento,
a.k.a. Barret Hansen, and two dozen former Doo Dah Parade queens and
grand marshals.</TE>
<TE>   Seated behind a roaring bonfire, the judges hurled barbed
questions -- and sometimes marshmallows -- at each of the 21 queen
contestants.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know what an LAPD chokehold is and can you apply it to
yourself?" they asked a drag-queen cop after hearing his rendition of
"Wild Thing."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you think you've milked that costume long enough and it's
time to come as someone else?" they said to a Charlie Chaplin
impersonator who had auditioned for queen several years running.</TE>
<TE>   The first contestant of the evening was Mutiny Spears, a drag
queen version of Britney, decked out in a blue wig and twinkling
electric body lights. Next up was the oxygen tank lady, who announced
she was awaiting a lung transplant and was "dying to be queen."</TE>
<TE>   Other entrants included a belly dancer, a Cruella De Vil drag
queen, a blues singer, a Carmen Miranda clone and Count Smokula,
whose main talent, aside from playing the accordion, was mugging for
the TV cameras. He had plenty of company. When a Channel 9
camerawoman flipped on her lights, contestants fluttered around it
like moths to a flame.</TE>
<TE>   But the pageant's camp factor quickly wore thin as the judges
talked over each other and asked increasingly tasteless questions;
and some of the contestants were so busy trying to whoop up media
attention they drowned out the rest of the event. One judge finally
warned them to knock it off or risk being disqualified.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many people trying too hard to be funny," muttered one
attendee.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, a Doo Dah queen was found amid the din. Molly
McIntosh, a willowy 21-year-old in a long white jacket, impressed the
judges with her bloodline. "I think I should be queen because my mom
and dad were the first king and queen of the Doo Dah Parade" 26 years
ago, she said. "That makes me Doo Dah royalty."</TE>
<TE>   To bolster her claim to the throne, McIntosh produced a rusty saw
and played it with a violin bow. After her coronation, McIntosh
expressed surprise that her talent helped her chances: "Everyone here
can play the saw if they want. I've only been playing a month."</TE>
<TE>   The latest incarnation of the Doo Dah Parade, which began in the
late 1970s as a spoof of the Rose Parade, will snake down Pasadena's
Colorado Boulevard on Nov. 24. Although the parade has been around
for years, public tryouts for queen began relatively recently, in
1996. Contestants have included animals dressed as people, people
dressed as animals, rejected Rose Queen contenders and even a
photocopy of a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most unusual entrants was Lily Hobge. Or rather, her
cremated ashes. In 1997, her widowed husband, Claude, told judges,
"I'm here on the part of my beautiful wife, Lily. We always enjoyed
the Doo Dah Parade and one of her last wishes was to be queen. And
she is in this box."</TE>
<TE>   The judges created a special title that year, "Queen of the
Hereafter."</TE>

<LD>Among the films screening in the AFI Fest 2002's Made in Germany
series is Andreas Dresen's briskly compelling "Grill Point," at the
ArcLight on Saturday and Sunday. It captures perfectly the edgy mood
of two middle-class couples for whom life is going stale as they
approach 40.</LD>
<LD>   The film takes its title from a popular riverside food stand in
the bleak industrial city of Frankfurt on the Oder in Eastern
Germany. It is owned by the burly Uwe (Axel Prahl), who works such
long hours to make it a success that he has neglected his family, his
wife, Katrin (Gabriela Maria Schmeide), in particular. This makes her
vulnerable to Uwe's best friend Chris (Thorsten Merten), a radio DJ,
now that the bloom has faded from his own marriage to the dutiful
Ellen (Steffi Kuhnert).</LD>
<LD>   Dresen reveals the excruciating pain and dark humor that erupts
when Chris and Katrin's affair is, inevitably, discovered, and how
these very real and basically straightforward people deal with their
predicament. The outcome proves unpredictable as the four discover
unexpected truths about themselves and each other.</LD>
<TE>   Since Dresen, who pulls no punches in depicting the selfishness of
passion's onslaught, matches his deep compassion with equal
detachment, never judging anyone, he leaves us suspecting that
viewers will vary widely in regard to which of these characters they
will identify and sympathize with.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Hernandez's "The City of No Limits," which the AFI Fest
2002 presents at the ArcLight Friday and Saturday, is a taut,
understated psychological mystery in which the veteran Spanish star
Fernando Fernan Gomez plays a wealthy, terminally ill Spanish
business tycoon whose family has gathered around him at a Paris
hospital. Apparently, he is in the grip of a fear that he won't be
able to get a timely warning to someone in danger named Rancel.</TE>
<TE>   His relatives regard him as delirious, but when his youngest son
(Leonardo Sbaraglia) arrives from Argentina, he gradually becomes
convinced that his father's distress may not be merely imaginary but
actually be connected with some dark incident in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Although his film is sleekly conventional, Hernandez does raise
some dire plot possibilities, starting with some possible chicanery
on the part of the tycoons' two oldest sons. The youngest son also
faces some romantic complications as he begins playing detective
through a thicket of vague allusions made by his father.The film, in
all its convolutions, retains its credibility, if not always its
clarity, to the finish. "The City of No Limits" has a strong payoff
and shows off a notable cast that includes Geraldine Chaplin, who
exudes an icy authority as the elegant matriarch of the family.</TE>

<HD>Trolling for treasures</HD>
<DH>One woman's quest for a gazillionaire turns out to be just
another day at the beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Samantha Bonar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read somewhere that one of Johnny Carson's wives nabbed him by
walking back and forth on the beach in front of his Malibu house in a
bikini.</LD>
<LD>   I decided to try it and see if I could land a generic
gazillionaire.</LD>
<LD>   I selected a secluded, little-known beach in one of the priciest
sections of Malibu. I purchased a Calvin Klein bikini (in "steel," to
match my nerves). I decided to troll once a week. I selected a
weekday, because I figured if a guy was around his house on a
Wednesday, he probably didn't have to work. I would bring my
Newfoundland, Auggie, the only dog of his breed who is afraid to
swim. I find that endearing, and men usually do too.</LD>
<TE>   To get to my selected beach, you have to walk through a nature
preserve, down a long flight of stairs and across a big field of
rocks. But it is worth it, because it is a pristine, nearly empty
stretch of sand. There often are seals and dolphins about. I soon
realized that it is also a prime surfing spot. The surfers almost
distracted me from my mission. Tall, lean and muscular, with
sea-salt-bleached hair, they epitomized California male beauty. But I
digress.</TE>
<TE>   The beach is at the base of a tall cliff lined with
gazillion-dollar homes. Most have private staircases leading to the
sand. So I plopped myself at the base of one of the staircases and
waited.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't have to wait long. On the third Wednesday, a gent came
down the stairs with his little fluffy dog, sat next to me and
started chit-chatting. He was of indeterminate middle age, middle
height and middle weight. "I just got back from Hawaii. I spend about
half the year there," he told me. "What do you do there?" I asked. "I
have interests," he said. That sounded promising.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you surf?" he asked me. "No," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to learn?" he asked. "No," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" he asked. "The water's too cold," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "You could borrow a wetsuit; I've got some right there in the
boathouse," he said, motioning behind him. "You could pick a
surfboard too."</TE>
<TE>   I had a vision of him standing behind me on a surfboard with his
arms wrapped around me to steady me. Ugh. "No thanks," I said.</TE>
<TE>   What was I doing? What about the plan?</TE>
<TE>   My new pal decided to surf. I could not help but compare him to
the bronze gods already in the water. He did not compare favorably.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of hours later he rejoined me on the beach. "I think I'll
go," I said. "Do you want to use my private staircase, so you won't
have to walk across the rocks?" he asked. "Sure," I said.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway up the staircase he showed me his guest quarters, built
into the side of the cliff, with its own private patio surrounded by
scarlet bougainvillea and an unobstructed view of the ocean. At the
top of the staircase, outside his palatial home, he asked, "Would you
like something to drink?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," I said. Did I just say that?</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like a drive to your car?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," I said, and Auggie and I beat a hasty retreat.</TE>
<TE>   Munching a fish taco at the La Salsa on PCH, tossing tortilla
chips into Auggie's mouth, I went over my day. I had success in my
hand and I balked. Why? Because he was a little old, a little gray
and a little pudgy in the middle. I just couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   I guess I'm too shallow to be a gold-digger.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armed with statistics about the relationship between the use of
cigarettes in movies and smoking by young people, leaders of major
health organizations went to the heart of Hollywood to denounce what
they called the promotion of smoking in movies.</LD>
<LD>   The leader of an anti-smoking movement was joined by officials
from the World Health Organization, Los Angeles County Director of
Public Health Jonathan Fielding and the American Lung Assn. The
American Medical Assn. also issued a statement in support of the
group. Kori Titus, director of anti-smoking programs for the lung
association, said 92% of PG-13 films currently in theaters feature
smoking.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the news conference at Hollywood and Highland urged
the industry to:</LD>
<TE>   * encourage R ratings for films that show smoking unless they also
show the consequences;</TE>
<TE>   *  stop identifying tobacco brands in all images;</TE>
<TE>   *  run anti-tobacco ads before films that contain any tobacco
presence, regardless of rating;</TE>
<TE>   * Certify in on-screen credits that nobody on a production
accepted anything of value from a tobacco company or its agents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a serious problem and this is a reasonable solution
within the existing framework of self-regulation" by the movie
industry, said Stanton Glantz of Smoke Free Movies.</TE>
<TE>   What prompted the health groups to join Glantz's campaign was the
continuing emergence of data that support the conclusion that smoking
in the movies increases youth smoking.</TE>

<HD>Something to crow about</HD>
<DH>Success at last. Cartoonist draws twisted tales of an
alcoholic bird.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a bartender offered him a free beer for every comic he drew,
Tony Millionaire got to work. Never mind that Millionaire wasn't a
comic strip artist -- he was a painter and an illustrator -- but he'd
just lost his girlfriend and his apartment, and he was looking for
some relief.</LD>
<LD>   And so Drinky Crow was born. The trigger-happy alcoholic bird is
now the protagonist of a depraved weekly comic strip that was
compiled this month into a book, "House at Maakies Corner"
(Fantagraphics). Millionaire's work also makes regular appearances in
the New Yorker magazine and his feathered friend has even starred in
a couple of animated shorts on "Saturday Night Live." Not bad for a
character that was created in a fit of desperation.</LD>
<LD>   "I really hit bottom," says Millionaire, who lives a far happier
life these days with his wife and 1-year-old daughter in Pasadena.
"With what I scraped together from the bottom, I created Drinky Crow,
and a lot of people relate to that ... because there's a time in your
life when you think you are Drinky Crow. It's not even about being
drunk. It's about just wanting to give up."</LD>
<TE>   "Maakies" chronicles the misadventures of the raven-feathered bird
and his simian sidekick, Uncle Gabby, a duo always up to no good in
their reckless use of firearms and self-destructive pursuit of
alcohol and women. The comics aren't especially hilarious, nor are
they meant to be.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Maakies' is about the horror of being alive," Millionaire says.
"It's not always about funny. I like to be very subtle and poignant
sometimes, and sometimes something makes me laugh, so I have to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Comic Andy Dick observed that "reading Tony's darkly luscious
comics is like losing that still unacquired bitter reality taste for
a moment."</TE>
<TE>   To counter some readers' complaints that his strip should be funny
all the time, Millionaire includes a second strip on the bottom of
the first one. The miniature, secondary comics are on entirely
different subjects, have quick punch lines and are far less
elaborately drawn than the dense, pen-and-ink renderings of the main
ones.</TE>
<TE>   "I picture my strips as sort of taking place around the 1910s,"
says Millionaire, whose comics often unfold on elaborate old ships
and around Victorian mansions, though there is the occasional
spaceship. "It's comics," he says with a shrug. "You can do whatever
you want."</TE>
<TE>   The ships and mansions are throwbacks to Millionaire's youth in
Gloucester, Mass., where he spent a lot of time with his
grandparents, both of whom were illustrators. At their house,
Millionaire liked to flip through their collections of 1920s and
1930s newspaper comics, which were, along with the original "Winnie
the Pooh" and "Raggedy Ann" books, the seeds of influence for his
comics today.</TE>
<TE>   It was his mother, however, who encouraged him to be an artist. A
junior high art teacher, she did not allow coloring books in the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd say, 'If you want to color a picture, draw one first,' "
says Millionaire, who is beginning to institute the same rule with
his daughter. "I threw out my first coloring book last week."</TE>
<TE>   His daughter's birth has been the inspiration for Millionaire's
recent foray into the children's book world. Last year, Dark Horse
comics released "Sock Monkey," the first in his series of children's
books. "The Glass Doorknob," the series' second installment, came out
in September.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Maakies," the "Sock Monkey" books feature a crow and a
monkey, but the characters are not the same.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the idea of a monkey and a crow. There's something
slightly scary and cute about both of them," he says. But the "Sock
Monkey" books are "more about beauty ... they're more about what
happens once you rise above it."</TE>
<TE>   Just as Millionaire has. It took years of struggling to make it as
a painter and illustrator before he found success, which, for an
artist, has come relatively late.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting harder to write comics about the themes of
depression and darkness now that I live in Pasadena surrounded by
flowers and babies," says Millionaire, 46. "I have to rely on my
memory."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Astandout sequence in West Coast Ensemble's acclaimed production of
John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" depicts the Joad men folk's
midday sojourn in the Colorado River.</LD>
<LD>   This episode finds audiences looking around for the water. It's
representative of the "absolute simplicity" that the ensemble's
managing director Claudia Jaffee, who staged "Grapes," was going for.</LD>
<LD>   She delayed accepting the assignment until a cold reading
convinced her that the script could stand alone. "I hung my hat on
that and Frank Galati's author's note saying not to fear the
technical demands."</LD>
<TE>   In the Tony-winning 1990 Steppenwolf production, these demands
included a real Ford Model A, flown-in chain-link fences and onstage
fire and rain. The original cast breakdown (35 actors in 62 roles)
was also imposing.</TE>
<TE>   Jaffee therefore selected her 26 players for personality as much
as for talent, "because their attitude was critical." Pulling the
creative staff from colleagues who would be "12 steps ahead of me,"
Jaffee began integrating design elements two weeks before technical
rehearsals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, achieving cohesion took some doing. "On headphones, the
rushing river sounded fine," says sound designer and assistant
director David Mark Peterson. "In the house, Claudia said it sounded
like popcorn."</TE>
<TE>   He settled on waterfall sounds, "slowed by about 30%," trusting
that with the addition of lights and bodies, "the illusion would
sustain." For the splashing sounds, Peterson threw himself into the
mix.</TE>
<TE>   "I used my spa at home, around midnight to avoid traffic noises,
approximating what the actors were doing," he says. "I didn't count
on crickets."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's visit to the Weedpatch camp featured in the play
inspired the song "One More Mile to Go."</TE>
<TE>   Such collaborative largess ways, artistic director Les Hanson
says, "typical of company response to this show."</TE>

<LD>Since the sexual revolution, a man needs a wife like a fish needs a
bicycle. And what mother today needs Mr. Right when she's got Uncle
Sam?</LD>
<LD>   The decline of marriage and the modern movement to revalue the
institution is the subject of tonight's "Frontline" documentary,
"Let's Get Married" (9 p.m. KCET, 10 p.m. KVCR).</LD>
<LD>   When the documentary's pundits offer such remarks as "Marriage is
the foundation of public life," they make getting hitched sound
decidedly unromantic. But that is their point. Marriage is not so
much a vehicle for romance as it is an institution for rearing
children, they argue. If we are to fix this ailing institution, we
need to redefine it.</LD>
<TE>   In this age of individualism, concepts such as a father's "duty"
and "obligation" to his children have become anathema. Perhaps, the
program suggests, our focus should shift from personal fulfillment to
the greatest good. From that stance, it is argued, springs the
foundation for civilized society. Thus the erosion of marriage and
society go hand in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Frontline" correspondent Alex Kotlowitz thoroughly explores the
subject by visiting communities in rural Oklahoma and inner-city
Chicago and by interviewing social scientists, religious leaders and
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   One weakness of "Let's Get Married" is that it fails to address
whether marriage has any value when no children are involved. Another
question is whether the government might be better off emphasizing
ways to avoid pregnancy instead of urging young men to marry the
mothers of their children.</TE>

<DH>Uncabaret's 'Say the Word' dispenses laughs.</DH>

<AU>James Verini</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mood in the Skirball Cultural Center last Friday night was one of
barely mitigated -- though petulant -- dismay. The Republicans had
achieved world domination, war was imminent and the writers and
comedians gathered for "Say the Word," a monthly event hosted by
Uncabaret, the alternative comedy collective, were questioning their
lives in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Outside, the rain was such that the city itself seemed to be
weeping. But for every plaintive story, there was a tinge of hope,
however sarcastic. No one was ready to pack up for Sweden just yet.</LD>
<LD>   Uncabaret matron Beth Lapides sounded the bass note for the
evening, asking, "Can you ever win with words?" A tangible "No"
seemed to hang in the air. But that wasn't going to stop her. The
native New Yorker read an essay entitled "To Live and Almost Die in
L.A.," which recounted her first sojourn at Disneyland ("Why wasn't
everybody screaming in horror?"), her attempts at lodging with an
sadomasochistic performance artist and a near-death hiking
experience. Despite her best efforts to hate L.A., Lapides wakes up
back in her Manhattan loft in love and with the word "Sepulveda" in
her head.</LD>
<TE>   Writer Judd Apatow, television comedy's resident Orson Welles,
admitted that he had time to be at the Skirball Center largely
because all of his shows had been canceled. "Want to hear bitter
diatribes about TV?" he asked, launching into a list of the absurd
beliefs of network executives: "Network executives believe that the
audience is a dumb 12-year-old boy who thinks edgy means loud, fast
and stupid."</TE>
<TE>   But just when it seemed Apatow was spiraling into a late-career
Lenny Bruce, he whipped out a dialogue (it might have been
handwritten backstage) between two reluctant terrorists hiding out in
San Diego who forgo their long-awaited martyrdom mission so as not to
miss the last season of "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday Night Live" alumnus Kevin Nealon, meanwhile, had larger
worries on his mind. "I wonder if Chinatown is developing a nuclear
weapon," he said, with that trademark vacant stare. "I wonder what
would happen if the Los seceded from the Angeles in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The evening ended with Moon Unit Zappa reading an excerpt from her
novel, "America the Beautiful" (a "girly rebuttal to High Fidelity"),
whose autobiographical main character, a celebrity daughter, goes
through a series of painfully L.A. love interests.</TE>
<TE>   She replaces an actor with an ice sculptor from Silver Lake who
turns out to be engaged to a model who trains seeing-eye dogs and
aspires to catering. Finally she finds something like happiness with
a "lame" but sweet TV producer.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has flaws," Zappa concluded. "It's a matter of finding
the ones you can live with."</TE>

<LD>   Universal, $30</LD>
<TE>   Last holiday season, Universal released a DVD of its 2000
blockbuster, directed by Ron Howard and starring Carrey as the big
green meanie. It featured the obligatory extras, such as deleted
scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes and even recipes. But because
Howard was working on "A Beautiful Mind," he wasn't available to
supply a commentary track.</TE>
<TE>   Howard did have time this year. The result is a two-disc deluxe
edition that features all the extras from last year's disc, plus more
recipes, interactive games for the kiddies and the observations of
Howard. He is an articulate and witty guide through the production of
this lavish film, which spread across 11 sound stages at Universal
Studios in Hollywood.</TE>

<TE>   Baseball fans should enjoy this slickly produced glimpse at 30

insights: The 30 highlights are covered in a scant 85 minutes (135 on
the DVD). Among the magical moments are Ruth's going to the New York
Yankees from the Boston Red Sox in 1920, Lou Gehrig's "farewell"
speech in 1939, Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak and Bobby
Thomson's Shot Heard 'Round the World in 1951. Each moment includes
clips, photos and interviews with players, experts and historians.</TE>

<LD>Trumpeting a musical cause</LD>
<LD>   It is rare enough that trumpeters are brought to the front of the
symphonic stage as soloists, rather than being behind pianists and
violinists who routinely take the solo spot.</LD>
<LD>   What concert-goers will hear at this weekend's New West Symphony
program is rarer still: a concert featuring three pieces from
different eras and cultures on three instruments from guest soloist
and trumpeter Jens Lindemann.</LD>
<TE>   Lindemann is one of those high-profile trumpeters who gives his
ancient but still under-spotlighted instrument a good and more public
name.</TE>
<TE>   The lead trumpeter for Canadian Brass for the past five years, he
is also a Grammy Award nominee who studied at New York City's
Juilliard School and also plays pop and jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Lindemann currently is a professor at UCLA, a job he keeps along
with his performance schedule..</TE>
<TE>   For his debut with the New West, diversity is the operative word.</TE>
<TE>   Lindemann will be featured playing the fluegelhorn on Richard
Peaslee's "Nightsongs," a 1973 piece with a jazz flavor, then on the
compact piccolo trumpet for 18th century composer Johann Wilhelm
Hertel's Trumpet Concerto No. 1 in E-flat for Piccolo Trumpet and
Armenian composer Alexander Arutiunian's Trumpet Concerto. Framing
Lindemann's portion of the program are Mozart's Serenade No. 6 in D,
K. 239, and Stravinsky's agreeable Modernist masterpiece
"Petroushka."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beckett bonus</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Samuel Beckett has roosted in Ojai, in the modest but
idealistic Theater 150, to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's fare will be the harrowing humor of the
playwright's minimalist play "Waiting for Godot," which is being
taken on by Nordhoff High School students Dan Baker, Frederico Equez,
Byron Campbell and Athena Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   For three weekends, starting on Nov. 22, the action turns to
"Happy Days," Beckett's dark comedy in which the central character
retains her sunny outlook despite being buried up to her waist. The
virtual monologue will be performed by Leslie Paxton, as Winnie, with
John Diehl, who also directs, occasionally showing up as her husband.</TE>

<LD>Buoyed by sales of higher-margin equipment for building and testing
the next generation of semiconductors, Applied Materials Inc. on
Wednesday posted increased profit in its fiscal fourth quarter but
warned of hard times ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara, Calif., company said it expected sales in the
current quarter to drop 20% from the fourth quarter because of
spending cutbacks by chip companies coping with a prolonged slump in
PC sales.</LD>
<LD>   Applied's recently announced plans to lay off 1,750 workers will
result in a charge that could push the company into the red for the
period ending Jan. 26, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Bronson.</LD>
<TE>   In the quarter ended Oct. 27, Applied reported net income of $147
million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $82 million, or
5 cents, in the fourth quarter a year ago. Sales rose 15% to $1.45
billion from $1.26 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   For the full fiscal year, Applied had net income of $269 million,
or 16 cents a share, down 47% from $507 million, or 30 cents, in
2001. Sales declined 31% to $5.1 billion from $7.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, Applied Chief Executive James
C. Morgan said the percentage of manufacturing capacity sitting idle
could top 45% by the end of the calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   "The semiconductor industry continues to face uncertain economic
conditions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts hope the company's grim forecast for the current quarter
is the last of the bad news.</TE>
<TE>   "They've done very well in this downturn, but the question is
whether this quarter will be the bottom," said David Wu, an industry
analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles who doesn't own
stock in the company or do business with it. "I hope that it will be,
but it's awfully weak out there."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Applied fell 37 cents to close at $14.70 on Nasdaq
before the results were announced. They dropped to $14.14 in
after-hours trading.</TE>

<LD>A Yorba Linda couple who allege that Salomon Smith Barney lost
$100,000 of their retirement money by making risky technology
investments will ask a state court judge today to hear their case,
which has been sidetracked by the ongoing dispute over how securities
complaints are handled in California.</LD>
<LD>   Oscar and Mercedes Bugarini are among more than 650 disgruntled
investors left in the lurch by the failure of the New York Stock
Exchange and NASD to provide arbitration panels to hear complaints
filed against brokers by California investors.</LD>
<LD>   Their fraud and breach-of-contract suit seeks to nullify Salomon's
requirement -- standard for the brokerage industry -- that
arbitrators appointed by the NYSE or NASD hear disputes instead of
courts. Attorneys for Salomon declined to comment on the case,
scheduled to be taken up today by Orange County Superior Court Judge
Thomas N. Thrasher.</LD>
<TE>   NASD, formerly the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, and the
NYSE have balked at appointing arbitration panels in California since
July, when tough state regulations took effect requiring arbitrators
to disclose potential conflicts of interest. In the latest twist, a
lawsuit filed by the NYSE and NASD that contended the state should be
bound by national disclosure rules was tossed out by a federal judge
in San Francisco, who ruled Tuesday that the state Judicial Council
can't be sued in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   In statements Wednesday, the NYSE and NASD said they were
considering their options, which appeared to be giving in to the
state, undertaking a lengthy federal appeal or challenging the state
rules in a California court.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bugarinis, who are in their 60s and contend that Salomon
didn't invest their money conservatively as they had asked, aren't
willing to wait. They also won't accept the alternative suggested by
the NYSE and NASD: to waive their rights under state law and have the
case decided by an arbitration panel under the national disclosure
rules.</TE>
<TE>   If Thrasher agrees to hear the case, it "could open the
floodgates" for lawsuits by other stymied investors, said the
Bugarinis' attorney, Douglas Ames of Huntington Beach.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Board Sets Steps for Getting Organized</HD>
<DH>The oversight group is leaving the task of choosing an
interim chairman to the SEC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The new U.S. accounting oversight board on Wednesday set "milestones"
for getting organized and left to the Securities and Exchange
Commission a decision on naming an interim chairman to replace
William H. Webster.</LD>
<LD>   Webster, who resigned from the board Tuesday in the wake of
controversies surrounding the SEC's process in selecting him, still
led the initial meeting Wednesday. He said he expected the SEC to
select one of the four remaining board members to serve as interim
chairman.</LD>
<LD>   The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, created by Congress
in July in the aftermath of this year's wave of accounting scandals,
scheduled its first formal meeting for early January. Before then,
the board's members agreed to develop a first-year budget and set
milestones including a review of auditing standards.</LD>
<TE>   Webster's selection last month drew criticism after reports that
SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt failed to inform other SEC commissioners
that Webster had headed the audit committee of a now-insolvent firm
being sued for fraud. The uproar caused Pitt to resign last week;
Webster followed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A permanent chairman to succeed Webster is not expected to be
named by the SEC until the Bush administration has filled Pitt's seat
at the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The board on Wednesday put out a call for resumes from people
interested in joining its staff. Resumes can be sent to any board
member, the panel said.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining board members are Kayla J. Gillan, former general
counsel of the California Public Employees' Retirement System; Daniel
L. Goelzer, an attorney at Baker &amp; McKenzie in Washington; former
Rep. Willis D. Gradison, an Ohio Republican; and Charles D. Niemeier,
chief accountant at the SEC's enforcement division.</TE>

<HD>FCC OKs Comcast-AT&amp;T Deal</HD>
<DH>The combined company will serve 27 million cable customers,
or 29% of the national market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Comcast Corp. got the green light Wednesday to become the nation's
biggest cable operator as government regulators approved its
$30-billion acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp.'s cable television business.</LD>
<LD>   In a 3-1 vote, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that
the deal would not harm consumers, may stabilize cable prices and
should spur the deployment of new services, such as high-speed
Internet access.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after the FCC decision, the Justice Department announced
it had no antitrust objections to the merger.</LD>
<TE>   In approving the deal, the FCC brushed aside predictions by
consumer groups, Internet service providers and television
programmers that worry that the combined company will wield too much
clout, potentially leading to higher cable prices.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of consumer groups said Wednesday that it planned to
file suit to block the deal. But with the government approvals, the
two companies are expected to close their deal in a matter of days.
"We are very pleased that the FCC has favorably concluded its review
of our merger," Comcast President Brian L. Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   The combined companies, to be called AT&amp;T Comcast Corp., will
serve 27 million customers in 41 states, controlling 29% of the
national pay-television audience. "The benefits of this transaction
are considerable," FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell said. "The
potential harm's negligible."</TE>
<TE>   But Michael J. Copps, the commission's sole Democrat and a
frequent critic of media consolidation, opposed the deal, saying he
feared it would give the company too much power over cable television
programming and distribution. "That is just too much raw commercial
power," Copps said.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast's acquisition of the No. 1 cable operator, AT&amp;T Broadband,
brings it back to the Southern California cable market. Comcast takes
over AT&amp;T Broadband's roughly 500,000 customers in Los Angeles County
and an additional 80,000 subscribers in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast, based in Philadelphia, in 1999 swapped the last of its
local cable systems -- in Seal Beach, Newport Beach, Fullerton and
Santa Ana -- with Adelphia Communications Corp. to concentrate on
markets that it could control geographically. Los Angeles is among
the few large cities that have not consolidated into the hands of a
single cable operator.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC's approval of the Comcast-AT&amp;T deal comes about a month
after the agency rejected a big satellite TV merger between EchoStar
Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp., parent of DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, a combination of AT&amp;T and Comcast would have been
a much harder sell. Old FCC rules prohibited any cable or satellite
provider from serving more than 30% of the pay-TV market. The new
AT&amp;T Comcast will skirt the edge of that limit, and according to some
estimates, may exceed it.</TE>
<TE>   But a federal appeals court in Washington vacated the rule as
unconstitutional, and the FCC has yet to set a new limit.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to their cable systems, AT&amp;T Comcast will have a stake
in Time Warner Entertainment, a joint venture with AOL Time Warner
Inc. As part of its approval, the FCC is requiring that AT&amp;T Comcast
put its Time Warner Entertainment stake into a separate trust until
it can be spun off as part of a previously announced deal between
AT&amp;T and AOL Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast's shares fell 70 cents to $23.30 on Nasdaq. AT&amp;T shares
fell 39 cents to $13.47 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Changes at Vivendi Suggest U.S. Spinoff</HD>
<DH>Fourtou joins Barry Diller as co-chief of restructured
entertainment assets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The script seemed fine -- until Paris called for a rewrite.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, sources close to media mogul Barry Diller and
Paris-based Vivendi Universal said that Diller had been tapped to
take on a more prominent role within the media conglomerate and serve
as co-Chief Executive with Jean-Rene Fourtou.</LD>
<LD>   A day later, however, the plot line changed. Those same sources
said Wednesday that Fourtou and Diller were in fact temporarily
teaming up to become co-CEOs of Vivendi's U.S. entertainment
division. That part of the corporation is now being rejiggered to add
the lucrative games unit and Universal Music Group to Diller's
existing portfolio: Universal's movie studio, theme parks and
television properties.</LD>
<TE>   "Diller's role was unclear within Vivendi Universal yesterday and
has been more well defined as of today," a company spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Diller and Fourtou said Wednesday that the two
executives had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   The management change appears mutually beneficial to both men.</TE>
<TE>   It expands Diller's role as chairman of Vivendi Universal
Entertainment while giving him even greater clout at Vivendi
headquarters in France. And it gives Fourtou, a former pharmaceutical
executive who has admitted to knowing little about the entertainment
industry, the credibility he needs as he tries to sell Wall Street on
the company's future in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe Fourtou is preparing the way for an eventual spinoff
of the Universal assets into a new, publicly held company in which
Vivendi would remain a major investor. There's been speculation that
Diller would run that new venture.</TE>
<TE>   By combining the various businesses, Vivendi wants to make them
more cohesive and palatable to investors, who have been confused by
Vivendi's far-flung assets, from mobile phone operations to water
utilities and publishing.</TE>
<TE>   "It just sets the stage for a spinoff of the entertainment
assets," said Paul Kim, analyst with Kaufman Bros. "It's all about
scale. If you don't have any size it's really tough to compete.
Vivendi recognizes that they have to create more critical mass" by
combining music and games with the other entertainment properties.</TE>
<TE>   One of the strongest proponents of a spinoff is influential board
member Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family sold the Seagram Co. and its
Universal operations to Vivendi for $34 billion in 2000, only to
watch them plummet in value.</TE>
<TE>   The management changes, described as temporary and unofficial,
reinforce Fourtou's recent message to shareholders that Vivendi would
remain a media and entertainment company. Vivendi already has
announced plans to sell the remaining stake in its 150-year-old water
utility and its publishing businesses to concentrate on
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   During his long career in Hollywood, Diller has earned a
reputation as a headstrong manager who doesn't always work well with
others. However, Diller and Fourtou have formed a close relationship
since Fourtou took the helm of Vivendi this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou replaced Jean-Marie Messier, who was ousted in a boardroom
coup after the company's stock fell 70% amid concerns about its $19
billion in media debt. That piled up during a three-year buying
spree, which included the acquisition of Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Vivendi fell 58 cents to $12.02 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Economy Hits 'Soft Patch'</HD>
<DH>Alan Greenspan is cautious but assures Congress that he
expects a recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that
continuing corporate scandals and worries about war with Iraq have
dimmed business prospects and caused the economy to hit a "soft
patch."</LD>
<LD>   Although Greenspan predicted that the economy will recover from
its troubles without sinking further, the Fed chairman appeared more
cautious than usual in his forecast, and suggested that further
interest rate and tax cuts may be needed.</LD>
<LD>   "Our best judgment is that we're going through a soft patch," but
are not headed for a "far more significant weakening," Greenspan told
the congressional Joint Economic Committee.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed chairman's testimony came one week after the central bank
unexpectedly slashed its signal-sending, federal funds interest rate
-- already at a four-decade low -- a half-point to 1.25%. Wednesday's
remarks largely were aimed at assuring the public that the latest
rate cut does not leave the central bank defenseless in the event of
further problems.</TE>
<TE>   But Greenspan's comments may have been most notable for
entertaining economic possibilities that until recently were
considered remote. For example, Greenspan said central bank
policymakers are looking for signs the U.S. is slipping into a
Japan-style deflation, or downward spiral of prices, even though they
believe the chances are slim. "Our conclusion is that we are not
close to a deflationary cliff," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said that if the country were to suffer deflation the
Fed could do more than use its traditional technique of cutting the
funds rates, the interest banks charge each other for short-term
loans. It could flood the economy with credit by snapping up bonds
with long terms or maturities. Such a move would attack deflation by
effectively inducing its opposite, inflation or a general rise in
prices.</TE>
<TE>   "If it ever got to the point ... where we could no longer lower
the target federal funds rate we could nevertheless increase the
liquidity of the [economic] system by moving out on the maturity
schedule," Greenspan said. "As a consequence, there is virtually no
meaningful limit to what we could inject into the system."</TE>
<TE>   But at least one former Fed official said the central bank would
be venturing into unknown terrain if it used up its traditional
interest rate tools.</TE>
<TE>   "One should think of getting to zero [on the fed funds rate] as a
big problem," said former Fed governor Janet Yellen, now at UC
Berkeley. "Once we get to zero, we're in a world of very
unconventional and untried methods."</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan acknowledged that he was perplexed about the economy's
current problems at least in part because the economic fundamentals
seem so sound. "The economy ... is not significantly out of balance,"
he told lawmakers. "We do not have excess inventories. We do not
have, as best we can judge, a debilitating large overhang of capital
stock."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Greenspan said, the country is still suffering from the
stock bust, "the fallout from corporate governance malfeasance
problems and ... the geopolitical risks surrounding the negotiations
with Iraq."</TE>

<HD>Analyst Was Asked to Reevaluate AT&amp;T</HD>
<DH>Citigroup CEO Sanford Weill says he urged Jack Grubman to
reexamine his rating but did not request an upgrade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Sanford Weill on Wednesday said he
urged former analyst Jack Grubman to reexamine his rating on AT&amp;T
Corp. but denied that he asked for the stock to be upgraded to gain
favor with AT&amp;T.</LD>
<LD>   Weill's disclosure was the first time he has admitted publicly to
being involved in the day-to-day business of the firm's stock
analysts, and it deepens questions about Wall Street practices
already under investigation by federal and state regulators.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, Weill said he asked Grubman in 1999 to "take a
fresh look" at AT&amp;T when the analyst rated the shares "hold."</LD>
<TE>   Grubman upgraded AT&amp;T to "buy" in the fall of 1999; after the
upgrade, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit was chosen as a lead
manager for the new stock offering of AT&amp;T's wireless unit, and it
earned nearly $45 million in banking fees.</TE>
<TE>   Weill admitted to asking Grubman to reevaluate his stance on AT&amp;T
but said the request was made "in light of the dramatic
transformation of the company and the industry."</TE>
<TE>   The statement came in response to a Wall Street Journal report
that Grubman, in e-mails to a friend, had said that Weill pushed him
to raise the rating on AT&amp;T. Grubman said Weill wanted to secure the
support of AT&amp;T CEO Michael Armstrong -- a member of Citigroup's
board -- in a power struggle between Weill and former co-CEO John
Reed.</TE>
<TE>   Weill, 69, said there was "absolutely no connection between"
Grubman's decision to raise AT&amp;T's rating and Armstrong's vote on
Reed's future. Reed stepped down in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, who quit Salomon in August, on Wednesday renounced the
e-mails, saying he lied in them to inflate his "professional
importance."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Grubman said: "I have said a number of
inappropriate, even silly, things in a few private e-mails that have
been made public over the last few months. The contents of these
particular e-mails, while personally embarrassing, are completely
baseless."</TE>
<TE>   Investors worried about Weill's future slammed Citigroup stock: It
fell $1.39 to $35 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Housing Sales Still Hot</HD>
<DH>The median home price surges to $273,000 in October, up 20%
from a year ago. Brokers say demand is being fueled by low mortgage
rates.</DH>

<LD>The median price of homes sold in Los Angeles County hit a record
high for the second month in a row in October, jumping more than 20%
from year-ago levels to $273,000, according to a report released
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The size of the year-over-year price increase -- the largest since
May 1989 -- surprised many housing industry observers, who had been
expecting the pace of residential real estate appreciation to taper
off. The report was issued by DataQuick Information Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Sales results for Orange County and the rest of Southern
California were not yet available.</LD>
<TE>   The strong demand, real estate brokers says, is being fueled by
near record-low mortgage rates, which seem to be offsetting concerns
about the economy and the threat of war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is still hot because the interest rates are still
low," said Century 21 broker Marty Rodriguez in Glendora.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in rates -- which last week averaged about 6.1% for a
30-year fixed-rate mortgage -- has had a particularly big effect in
driving sales of less-expensive homes. Lower- and middle-income
buyers can now qualify for loans.</TE>
<TE>   "Rates have the biggest impact on first-time buyers, and we've
been in a strong market in that regard," said Mark Dilbeck, president
of Dilbeck Realtors GMAC Real Estate in La Canada-Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at the high end of the market, where buyers are less
sensitive to interest rates, cheaper mortgages have not had nearly as
much of an effect. As a result, properties priced above $1 million
seem to be taking longer to sell, Dilbeck noted.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez and other brokers said home buyers overall have
continued to open escrows at a brisk pace, a sign that sales activity
might remain busy even during the normally slow holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Long, president of DBL Realtors in Los Angeles, said he is
encouraging his agents to hold more open houses during the coming
weeks to take advantage of demand generated by the lower interest
rates. "I think that the market is going to be really strong" this
winter, Long said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's robust performance in October came amid
growing concern among some analysts that a speculation-driven real
estate "bubble" is forming in other cities. The bubble could burst,
they say, with continued economic weakness.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, real estate activity in the L.A. region seems to
reflect genuinely strong demand -- not people buying simply in the
hopes of seeing a quick profit, said DataQuick analyst John Karevoll.
"The demand for housing is being generated at a steady pace," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of worrying about a bubble bursting, potential buyers in
Los Angeles seem more concerned about simply finding a suitable house
to purchase, say brokers. Supply is limited.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigue Colaianni, 29, made offers on four properties last summer
before he snagged a $395,000 duplex in Echo Park that had not yet
been included in the real estate listing service.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is crazy," said Colaianni, who helps foreign students
find internships in the U.S. "The sellers basically do whatever they
want. You do an offer at full price and you don't even get a
response. I found it very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The number of Los Angeles County homes sold in October (including
new and existing houses, as well as condominiums) rose by about 10%
from the same month last year to 10,422, according to DataQuick.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly sales for the county were the highest since October
1989, when 11,403 homes were sold.</TE>

<HD>Homestore to Join SmallCap Market to Avoid Delisting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore Inc., whose stock has traded below $1 a share since July,
said Wednesday that it will move to the Nasdaq SmallCap Market from
the Nasdaq National Market next week, gaining 90 more days to get the
stock back above $1 and avoid being delisted.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing third-quarter results Wednesday, the Westlake
Village-based online real estate company also said it had cut its
work force to fewer than 2,000, down from 3,500 a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Homestore lost $39.8 million, or
34 cents a share, on revenue of $63.8 million, compared with a
year-earlier loss of $138.3 million, or $1.25 a share, on revenue of
$80.8 million.</LD>
<TE>   The news was released after the close of trading Wednesday.
Homestore's stock closed unchanged at 85 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore Chief Executive Mike Long said the company will have
more than $75 million in cash available next year.</TE>
<TE>   Long is part of a new executive team that was hired in January
after Homestore's previous management was forced out amid disclosures
of a scheme to illegally inflate the company's revenue.</TE>

<HD>IRS Looks to Reunite Refunds, Taxpayers</HD>
<DH>Agency is taking a stab at returning $80 million, with
Californians representing a disproportionate share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Missing a tax refund? The Internal Revenue Service is looking for
96,792 individuals -- including 4,765 L.A. County residents -- who
are owed $80 million in tax refunds.</LD>
<LD>   Every year, a small percentage of U.S. taxpayers file a return
with an illegible return address or move without filing a forwarding
address with the U.S. Postal Service.</LD>
<LD>   At the start of the holiday season, the IRS gathers checks that
were returned as undeliverable, totals them and takes a stab at
reuniting the taxpayers with their money.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to get this money back where it belongs," said IRS acting
Commissioner Bob Wenzel. "As soon as taxpayers get us their correct
addresses, we can reissue the checks."</TE>
<TE>   Californians represent a disproportionate share of the missing
money. There are 15,589 Californians who are owed $13.4 million --
about 16% of the missing individuals and nearly 17% of the unclaimed
money. The state accounts for a little more than 12% of the U.S.
population.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County accounts for about 5% of the total, said local IRS
spokesman Victor Omelczenko. Los Angeles County taxpayers are due
refunds ranging from $1 to $53,246, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers can use the agency's Web site to find the status of
their refund by clicking on the "Where's my refund?" button at
www.irs.gov. Taxpayers must provide their Social Security number,
filing status and exact amount of the expected refund.</TE>
<TE>   The feature won't be available after Dec. 2 because the IRS will
be retooling the site for the 2003 filing season.</TE>
<TE>   Those without Internet access can check the status of a refund by
calling the IRS toll-free assistance line at (800) 829-1040.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers who are due a refund can get it via mail by providing a
new address, or they can have it automatically transferred into their
bank account.</TE>
<TE>   To change an address, taxpayers must file Form 8822, which can be
downloaded from the IRS Web site or requested through the agency's
tax-form hotline at (800) 829-3676.</TE>

<HD>Isuzu to Cut More Than a Third of U.S. Staff</HD>
<DH>The plan to lay off about 150 is part of a last-ditch
effort to save the ailing American subsidiary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling American Isuzu Motors, already in a downward spiral marked
by slumping sales, layoffs and asset divestitures, is preparing to
fire more than a third of its remaining U.S. staff by the end of the
year.</LD>
<LD>   About 150 of the company's 400 employees will be laid off over the
next two months, Isuzu employees at the company's North American
headquarters in Cerritos were told this month. A company spokesman
confirmed the plan Wednesday but declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   The move is part of a last-ditch effort to save the 21-year-old
company, which helped introduce the sport utility vehicle to the
North American market but failed to capitalize on its tremendous
popularity.</LD>
<TE>   Some auto industry analysts say that saving Isuzu is a
near-impossible task.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen sicker dogs get well, but it is not likely in this
case," said truck industry specialist Jim Hossack, senior consultant
at Tustin-based AutoPacific Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Isuzu's Japanese parent, Isuzu Motors Ltd., is primarily a
commercial truck and diesel engine manufacturer and has been battered
by the slumping Japanese economy, in which demand for its large
trucks has dropped 60% or more in the last two years. As a result,
the company has ended what little support it had been giving its U.S.
offspring.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, General Motors Corp., which has invested heavily in
Isuzu in order to benefit from its diesel engine expertise, has
publicly questioned the need for the company to sell sport utility
vehicles in the U.S. -- often in direct competition with GM products
-- and has slashed its investment in Isuzu Motors from a 49% stake to
12%.</TE>
<TE>   "They just don't have the capital" to compete, said Burnham
Securities auto industry analyst David Healy. "It has been the case
for a while now with the Japanese vehicle companies. The rich are
getting richer and the poor are getting poorer."</TE>
<TE>   Isuzu's U.S. sales fell more than 35% from their peak in 1986
through the end of last year and are off 38% for the first 10 months
of this year compared with the same period in 2001; 2002 is on track
to be American Isuzu's worst year since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to conserve resources and amass a little capital,
Isuzu last month agreed to sell its share of a joint-venture U.S.
manufacturing plant, Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc., to Subaru's
parent, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. The company also sold to GM
controlling interest in its U.S. diesel engine plant in Marion, Ohio,
and in a small diesel plant in Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Many industry watchers have taken the deals as a signal that Isuzu
plans to withdraw from the passenger vehicle market in the U.S.,
although terms of the acquisition of the manufacturing facility call
for Subaru to continue building about 30,000 vehicles for Isuzu to
sell through its 495 U.S. dealerships.</TE>
<TE>   Isuzu got into the SUV market almost by accident. It began sales
in the U.S. in 1981 with a small pickup, added passenger cars the
next year, and in 1984 gave dealers a small utility vehicle to see if
they could use it to help augment their incomes. At the time, SUVs
were, at best, a niche product, and the only competition was from
Jeep.</TE>
<TE>   But the SUV took off -- Isuzu started selling sport utilities just
as American car buyers started looking for alternatives to minivans
and station wagons -- and car sales started dwindling. American Isuzu
stopped selling cars in 1993 and became the "all-SUV" company.</TE>
<TE>   "But they were not experienced in marketing in the competitive
U.S. truck market," Hossack said. "They grew by luck and by the help
of one really good set of commercials, at a time the U.S. sport
utility market was growing like crazy."</TE>
<TE>   That set of commercials was the original "Joe Isuzu Liar" campaign
that ran from 1986 through 1989 and helped triple Isuzu's name
recognition among car shoppers. The Joe Isuzu character -- who made
outrageous claims about the company's products then announced with a
grin that he was lying -- was resurrected last year but failed to
gain the same traction.</TE>
<TE>   Since its advertising heyday in the late 1980s, Isuzu's U.S.
marketing budget has been steadily chipped away, and the company's
name recognition has plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was Isuzu's early success with SUVs such as the
Rodeo and Trooper that helped hasten its troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "They were doing so well ... that they drew the attention of the
big guys, like Toyota and Honda and Nissan, and those guys studied
the U.S. market and came in with real game plans," Hossack said.
"Isuzu is a very good commercial truck maker, but it was an amateur
in the U.S. light truck market 15 years ago, and it is still an
amateur."</TE>

<HD>Jack in the Box Profit Falls 32.3%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heavy discounting by its competitors and previously announced
one-time charges helped take a bite out of fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings at San Diego-based Jack in the Box Inc., which reported a
32.3% drop in net income Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's fourth-largest burger chain reported earnings of $14
million for the quarter ended Sept. 29, down from $20.7 million in
the year-ago period. Earnings per share were 35 cents, down from 52
cents in the year-ago period.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue increased by 4.7% to $463.3 million.</LD>
<TE>   For the full fiscal year, earnings were essentially flat: $83
million compared with $82.2 million a year ago. Revenue for the year
grew by 7.2% to $1.97 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Jack in the Box shares lost 33 cents to close at $20 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts noted that the weak economy has prompted many
cash-strapped consumers to look for bargains or stay home, while
burger-heavy chains such as Jack in the Box are losing ground to
so-called quick-casual fare restaurants offering healthier, fresher
and higher-priced alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "From the quick-serve restaurant perspective, it's been a much
more competitive environment," said David L. Rose of JMP Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Jack in the Box cited "continuing declines in consumer confidence,
expectations for ongoing economic challenges and related softness in
sales" in dropping its earnings estimate for fiscal 2003 to $91
million from the $98.6 million previously forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at company restaurants open more than a year fell by 2.7% in
the fourth quarter, contrasted with last year's 3.8% rise, the
company said. For the year, same-store sales dipped by 0.8%,
contrasted with a 4.1% increase in fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been and continues to be a challenging environment," said
Chief Executive Robert J. Nugent, who lamented the "extremely high
levels of discounting by the national chains."</TE>
<TE>   In the fall, McDonald's Corp., the nation's No. 1 burger chain,
sought to lure new customers with aggressive nationwide marketing of
a "value menu" featuring items discounted to $1. The move forced
Burger King to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   To help boost sales, Jack in the Box plans to launch two new
higher-end sandwiches in January, and to expand its own "value menu"
of lower-priced items next month.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the firm plans to step up its franchising efforts.
Currently, the company owns about 80% of the stores. Over the next
five years, Jack in the Box hopes to have 65% of its stores
company-owned and 35% franchised.</TE>

<LD>   Shares of Taubman, which said it has no interest in further
discussions of a deal, nonetheless rose 12%, as some investors
apparently bet the company could be forced into a merger.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies have malls in Southern California. Bloomfield
Hills, Mich.-based Taubman owns Beverly Center in Los Angeles and
Simon owns the Shops at Mission Viejo and Brea Mall, among others.</LD>
<TE>   Simon Property's offer valued Taubman Centers at $17.50 in cash
per common share. The offering price would total $920 million.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Property also proposed to negotiate the acquisition of
Taubman operating units valued at $550 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Our all-cash offer would deliver to Taubman shareholders a
substantial premium -- approximately 18% above [Tuesday's] closing
price and 30% above the price on the day we initially made our
offer," Simon said. "And it exceeds the highest price at which
Taubman shares have ever traded."</TE>
<TE>   Taubman issued a statement saying its board "unanimously concluded
that Taubman Centers has no interest in pursuing a sale transaction,
and that discussions regarding such a transaction would not be
productive."</TE>
<TE>   The statement also said the Taubman family is not interested in
selling the company.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Taubman closed at $16.59 on the New York Stock Exchange,
up $1.79. Simon shares declined 85 cents, or 2.5%, to $33.10, also on
the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Property's takeover offer was the latest attempt at
consolidation in an industry that has experienced several
acquisitions in recent months, said a spokeswoman for the
International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Simon owns or has an interest in 249 properties totaling nearly
186 million square feet in 36 states.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Are Mixed on Concern About Citigroup, Iraq</HD>
<DH>The Dow and Nasdaq eke out small gains, while the S&amp;P
slips. Both gold and oil prices decline as war fears ease somewhat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks ended mixed Wednesday as downbeat news about financial
services giant Citigroup put pressure on blue chips and traders
debated the significance of Iraq's decision to accept a U.N.
resolution to disarm.</LD>
<LD>   "The shorter-term implication of Iraq is weighing on people's
minds. How will it affect the Christmas season? How many are fearful
there will be domestic retaliation here?" said Ned Riley, chief
investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.</LD>
<LD>   The news also roiled commodity markets, where oil and gas prices
fell sharply.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.49
points, or 0.2%, to 8,398.49, after earlier rising 107 points.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-laced Nasdaq composite index gained 11.78 points,
or 0.9%, to 1,361.34. But the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
ended down a fraction of a point, or 0.1%, at 882.53.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 10 to 9 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They were about even on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Dow component Citigroup slumped $1.39 to $35 and was the most
active stock on the Big Board as the bank again was embroiled in
questions about whether its chief executive influenced stock market
research.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't help investors' confidence, and it's a huge company
that weighs on all the major averages," said David Memmott, head of
listed block trading at Morgan Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks were helped early in the session by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's hopeful words about the economy in
testimony before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said the economy doesn't appear to have the usual
weaknesses that presage slumps.</TE>
<TE>   Traders, however, said the reverberations of Greenspan's remarks
in the market were short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Greenspan spoke but was kind of anticlimactic," said Memmott.
"There was not a whole lot he could say except basically that he's
got his eye on the economy."</TE>
<TE>   In energy markets, crude oil futures ended sharply lower after
hitting their lowest level in five months Wednesday on Iraq's
unconditional acceptance of the U.N. Security Council resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Oil fell 71 cents a barrel to $25.19 in New York trading -- its
lowest close since June. Oil and gas shares fell in tandem. The S&amp;P
index of energy stocks slipped 2% and was the worst-performing
industry group in the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, a traditional safe haven during times of international
tension, also fell sharply, losing $5.80 an ounce to $318.70.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Defense shares fell as the prospect of war dimmed. Lockheed
Martin, the biggest military contractor, fell $1.30 to $53.23.
General Dynamics declined $1.07 to $78.99. Northrop Grumman slid
$4.01 to $93.27.</TE>
<TE>   * Sears dragged on the broader market, falling $1.70, or 7.5%, to
$21 after an analyst downgrade rekindled concern that the company may
suffer a prolonged slump in profit and sales growth. Sears hit a
20-year low of $19.75 early in the session.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug giants Schering-Plough and Merck weighed on pharmaceutical
stocks. Schering-Plough fell 87 cents to $20.66 after saying it
received two grand jury subpoenas from federal investigators in
Massachusetts related to its clinical trial, sales and marketing
practices. Merck ended down $2.02 at $52.80 after disclosing late in
the session that the Justice Department is probing its marketing
practices as part of a larger investigation into pharmaceutical
companies.</TE>
<TE>   * Wal-Mart Stores rose $1.13 to $54.98. The world's largest
retailer said third-quarter profit rose 23% as apparel sales climbed.
Its net income of 41 cents a share beat analysts' estimates by a
penny.</TE>
<TE>   * Playtex Products gained $1.61 to $10.81 after the maker of
personal-care products said it is looking at ways to boost
shareholder value, including the possible sale of the company.</TE>

<HD>Deals Set Stage for Online Music Firms</HD>
<DH>Licenses allow them to offer songs from major labels and
open door to competition on features.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A spate of licensing deals this week finally will allow an array of
online music companies to offer songs from most or all of the major
record labels, setting the stage for them to compete on the features
they offer instead of on the limitations of their catalogs.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say notable shortcomings remain in all the authorized
services that could hurt their appeal and stunt innovation.
Nevertheless, online music executives say that after two years of
scrambling for licenses, they finally have reached the starting line
for real competition.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, they say the fights will be over how to package
songs, help consumers navigate online collections and extend services
from the computer to living room stereos, portable devices and cars.
They'll also vie for partnerships with Internet providers, cable TV
companies, retailers and other distributors that can help sell their
services.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot of room for experimentation, and I don't think
consumers necessarily know what is the best way to consume online
music yet," said Dave Williams, vice president of product management
at Listen.com Inc.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the week, the subscription music services from
MusicNet Inc. and Pressplay are expected to join Listen.com in
offering five major record companies' music as well as songs from
large independent labels.</TE>
<TE>   Rival services from FullAudio Corp., MusicMatch Inc. and
Streamwaves have deals with all the major labels except those owned
by Sony Corp., and they expect to fill that hole by early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Vivendi Universal subsidiary Emusic offers a
subscription downloading service with songs from hundreds of
independent labels and older tunes from Universal Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   The companies' main competition still comes from online pirates,
and concerns about piracy dictate many of the licensing terms offered
by the labels.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a fear and skepticism of the digital arena that permeates
the music industry," said analyst Steve Vonder Haar of Interactive
Media Strategies, a technology research group. "And that slows
innovation by the record labels."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the company with the most subscribers appears to be
MusicMatch, which has more than 100,000, followed by Emusic, which
has 70,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although their differences are narrowing with each new deal,
online companies offer consumers at least three subscription plans
for music: online jukeboxes, sampling services and full-service tools
for building music collections.</TE>
<TE>   For $10 or more a month, the full-service offerings enable
consumers to hear music on demand and download the songs they would
like to play when they are not online. They can burn permanent copies
onto a compact disc for an additional fee.</TE>
<TE>   A pioneer in this category is Los Angeles-based Pressplay, a joint
venture of Sony and Universal Music Group. Pressplay plans to
announce today that it has obtained the rights to music from its
fifth major label: AOL Time Warner subsidiary Warner Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaling Pressplay are Full- Audio of Chicago and Los
Angeles-based MusicNet, which is owned by EMI Recorded Music, AOL
Time Warner, Bertelsmann, Zomba Recording Corp. and RealNetworks Inc.
MusicNet is expected to announce this week its transformation into a
full-service music provider with burnable downloads from all five
major labels.</TE>
<TE>   The jukebox services let consumers hear music on demand for $10 to
$15 a month. The main players are Listen.com of San Francisco and
Streamwaves of Dallas, both of which announced deals Wednesday with
EMI to let subscribers burn songs onto CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in December, San Diego-based MusicMatch plans to offer a
variation on an online jukebox that lets subscribers listen to all
the music from more than 8,000 different artists or bands on demand
but not to burn it on CDs. The service, which will cost about $5 a
month, is designed to help consumers discover music, said Peter
Csathy, MusicMatch's president and chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Samit, a senior vice president at EMI, said his company was
trying to spur innovation by striking deals with a broad selection of
online companies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still early," he said. "It's an evolutionary process."</TE>

<HD>Space Shuttle Receives a New Lease on Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NASA had welcome news Wednesday for thousands of Southern California
space shuttle workers as the agency scrubbed plans for a reusable
launch vehicle and decided instead to extend the life of the shuttle
another decade.</LD>
<LD>   Acknowledging that perfecting a reusable rocket technology could
take 15 years, NASA said that in the interim it wanted to develop a
smaller, less ambitious orbital space plane capable of ferrying
astronauts to the International Space Station.</LD>
<LD>   NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe outlined the strategy shift as
part of his broad new plan for transporting crews into space. The
agency's revised spending proposal was signed by President Bush late
Wednesday and forwarded to Congress for approval.</LD>
<TE>   Bush tapped O'Keefe, a former deputy director of the Office of
Management and Budget, as NASA's chief in January as the agency was
facing massive cost overruns from the space station. His background
as a budget cutter sparked fear among scientists that he would make
major cuts in programs at NASA.</TE>
<TE>   Even long-time critics of NASA applauded O'Keefe's latest
strategic move.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he is generally going in the right direction," Charles
Vick, an independent space policy analyst, said of the NASA
administrator. "He's being much more pragmatic."</TE>
<TE>   The latest spending blueprint doesn't change NASA's total request
of $15 billion for the current fiscal year, up from an estimated
$14.9 billion in 2002. But it does redirect funding from the Space
Launch Initiative, which included developing the reusable launch
vehicle, as NASA plans instead to spend $1.6 billion over the next
five years to upgrade the space shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the rocket engine work on the space shuttle is carried out
at Boeing Co.'s Canoga Park facility, while engineers at its
Huntington Beach plant do design work on the shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   NASA has also asked Congress to add funding for a fifth shuttle
launch each year for the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, Southern California was where the shuttle
underwent major modifications. That work was moved to Florida to be
closer to the launch site, but some officials believe that with
increased upgrade work the shuttle could return to its longtime base
in Palmdale. About 1,000 people once worked on the shuttle in
Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gearing up" to meet NASA's needs, said Glen Golightly, a
Boeing spokesman in Huntington Beach. "We're talking to them about
what they want done."</TE>
<TE>   Boeing employees in Huntington Beach are particularly ebullient
because designing and testing the Delta IV rocket also is done there.
The new rocket, slated for its first launch Saturday, may get a
significant boost since NASA is considering it to carry the backup
shuttle crew into orbit. About 7,000 people work for Boeing in
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The new orbiter, officially dubbed the Orbital Space Plane, would
be launched into space atop a rocket and return to Earth on its own
power, much like the space shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   NASA expects to pick a contractor in 2004 to develop the space
plane. The agency will spend $2.6 billion over five years to develop
a prototype.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Orbital
Sciences Corp. are likely to bid on the project. But the new space
plane won't be ready to fly until 2010 under NASA's latest plan.</TE>
<TE>   As such, the agency said it wants to funnel money that already had
been earmarked for research into reusable rockets to upgrade the
space shuttle and keep the vehicles flying until 2022. Ironically,
the shuttle, introduced in 1981, was supposed to last only a decade.
But many shuttle supporters said it has never been used the way it
was envisioned when shuttles were once seen taking off every few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It is pretty apparent to us what we're looking at is a very
remarkable machine," O'Keefe said of the space shuttle. "It's still
got low mileage, and it seems its life can be extended for a
considerable period of time."</TE>

<HD>Troubled Unit Drags Down PG&amp;E Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp. said Wednesday that third-quarter net income fell 40%
because of deterioration at its subsidiary that builds power plants
and trades energy, which will begin defaulting on its debts today.</LD>
<LD>   For the July-to-September period, PG&amp;E reported net income of $466
million, or $1.19 a share, down from $771 million, or $2.12, a year
earlier. Net income was affected by several charges, including $75
million in interest costs from the state's energy crisis and the
bankruptcy of PG&amp;E's utility, and $32 million for bankruptcy legal
and financial advice.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue grew 8.1% to $4 billion from $3.7 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The San Francisco company said its Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
utility, which filed for Bankruptcy Court protection in April 2001,
turned in a strong performance during the quarter. But National
Energy Group, its unregulated power-generation and trading unit,
suffered a nearly 60% drop in profit due to the lower power prices
and tighter credit that have hurt the entire energy merchant sector.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Chief Executive Robert D. Glynn Jr. said National Energy
Group is talking with creditors to develop a "consensual
restructuring plan" because the Bethesda, Md.-based unit can no
longer pay its debts, beginning with a $431-million loan due today
and an additional $52 million due Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A PG&amp;E spokesman said NEG, which laid off 178 people during the
quarter, is working with creditors to avoid bankruptcy and may be
forced to abandon or sell assets.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service responded by downgrading five types of
National Energy Group debt, totaling $3.4 billion, by as many as four
notches to as low as Ca. That translates into a "highly speculative"
rating on the Moody's scale.</TE>
<TE>   "PG&amp;E Corp. had a number of important successes in the third
quarter and some significant challenges," Glynn said in a morning
conference call with investors and analysts.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's stock rose 23 cents to $11.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Michael S. Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison said National
Energy Group faces "potentially fairly large write-downs."</TE>
<TE>   "Everything else was in line with expectations as much as it can
be for a company with a utility in bankruptcy and NEG half a step
away," Worms said.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., which ran up huge power debts during
the California energy crisis of 2000-2001, has been steadily
shrinking those debts because the rates the utility collects from
customers are now higher than the cost of power.</TE>
<TE>   That excess collection, known as "headroom," totaled $376 million,
or 95 cents a share, in the third quarter.</TE>

<HD>No Sanctions on Port Slowdowns</HD>
<DH>Justice Department says additional factors, including
congestion in terminal yards, contributed to the drop in
productivity.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department said Wednesday that it will not pursue
contempt penalties against the dockworkers union or shipping
companies for contributing to slowdowns in violation of a court order
to keep West Coast ports moving normally.</LD>
<LD>   The statement was filed with the U.S. District Court in San
Francisco on the eve of a status conference today involving the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime
Assn, which represents shipping lines and terminal operators.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides are working under an Oct. 8 federal injunction that
reopened ports after a 10-day lockout. Mediated contract negotiations
resumed Wednesday morning and were set to continue today.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Department attorneys said they had "credible evidence"
that the union and shipping group both contributed to drops in
productivity. They cited the union's mandate that members adhere
strictly to safety rules and refuse overtime. They also cited severe
congestion in terminal yards, which was exacerbated by the decision
of some shipping lines to drop all containers from a vessel at one
port rather than making multiple stops along the coast.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is not able to determine at this time that
either party has engaged in improper conduct of sufficient scope or
effect as to warrant a recommendation [that] this court impose a
penalty for contempt of the order," the Justice Department said in
the filing.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA filed briefs with the department last month alleging that
the union had engaged in a "concerted, systematic slowdown" that cut
productivity by as much as 34%.</TE>
<TE>   The union in turn claimed that the PMA violated the injunction by
failing to work cooperatively with the union to address operational
problems caused by congestion.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department statement noted that with the help of a
federal mediator, negotiators for the union and shipping group have
made progress in recent weeks. On Nov. 1, the mediator announced a
breakthrough agreement on the implementation of labor-saving
technology, which has been the stickiest issue in the talks.</TE>

<HD>Study Says Calif. Hospital Costs Surging</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hospital costs in California have risen at almost double the national
rate in recent years, driven largely by the state's acute nursing
shortage, new technology and hospital consolidations, according to a
study released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, from the BlueCross BlueShield Assn., found that
hospital inpatient costs in California rose by 11.3% annually from
1998 to 2001, the second-highest rate in the nation, behind New
Jersey. California led the nation in the percentage of patients with
the most expensive discharges, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   "California historically has been known for lower costs and less
use of medical and hospital facilities through its managed-care
system," said Maureen Sullivan, senior vice president for strategic
services for the BlueCross BlueShield Assn. "Now, costs are growing
at rates that are among the highest or the highest in the nation."</LD>
<TE>   The report comes as the hospital industry is facing greater
scrutiny as regulators step up their review of past hospital mergers
for their effect on pricing.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, government officials have focused on special
Medicare reimbursements in the wake of disclosures by Tenet
Healthcare Corp. The company acknowledged that it received an
unusually large share of these supplemental payments for complicated
cases, in part because it aggressively raised hospital charges in
certain markets. Tenet, with 40 hospitals in California, is the
biggest hospital operator in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The BlueCross BlueShield Assn. study, which was conducted by
outside experts in academia and at consultant firms, did not examine
costs at specific hospital companies. But the report said
consolidations, which have given hospital companies greater leverage
in negotiations with insurers, were as significant a factor in rising
inpatient costs as technology.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lott, executive vice president of the Healthcare Assn. of
Southern California, a hospital trade group, said the BlueCross
BlueShield report does not state the full story. Although hospital
costs are indeed rising, payments to hospitals in California from
insurers still lag behind those in most other states, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not inaccurate in what they're reporting, they're just
not putting it in the correct framework," Lott said. He said fat
earnings at managed-care companies such as WellPoint Health Networks
Inc., the parent of Blue Cross of California, are a big driver in
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   The BlueCross BlueShield report supported other reports that
showed hospital expenses recently have replaced prescription drugs as
the major contributor to rising health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   William Pierskalla, a UCLA professor and former dean of its
Anderson School of business, said other factors contributed to the
shift, such as mounting pressure on drug companies to rein in prices.
He also said managed care has abandoned its watchdog approach and
serves merely as a pass-through feature on the health-care landscape,
acquiescing to demands for higher hospital pay and passing those
costs on to consumers and employers.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, however, insurance companies, prodded by employers, have
taken a more aggressive stance on hospital pricing.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the state's leading insurers, including Health Net Inc.,
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. and Blue Shield of California, have
introduced health plans that charge members higher co-payments or
deductibles for using costlier hospitals. It is not clear yet whether
these plans have pressured hospitals to lower prices, and hospital
officials have complained that these tiered hospital plans fail to
take into account differences in quality.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Health Net announced that its Web site now would
allow its members to compare California hospitals on a variety of
factors such as mortality rates, medical complications and billing
rates. The site is part of a plan in which Health Net will use a
three-tier co-payment system for hospitals, much the way that health
plans charge different co-payments for prescription drugs.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Federated
Department Stores posted higher quarterly earnings Wednesday, but
analysts remain worried about weaker consumer spending in the holiday
season.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, said profit jumped 23% in
the quarter ended Oct. 31.</LD>
<LD>   Federated, parent of Macy's and Bloomingdales, also posted strong
earnings, helped by tighter inventories that reduced the need for
markdowns.</LD>
<TE>   Wal-Mart said net income climbed to $1.82 billion, or 41 cents a
share, from $1.48 billion, or 33 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose
11% to $58.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But Wal-Mart said earnings in the current quarter could be as low
as 53 cents a share. Analysts had expected 55 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Federated said net income in the latest quarter jumped to $106
million, or 54 cents a share, from $3 million, or 2 cents, a year
earlier. Results in both quarters were skewed by one-time items.
Excluding those items, Federated said profit was $75 million versus
$26 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Sales were up less than 1%, to $3.48 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Federated forecast that same-store sales in the current quarter
will be flat to down 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite concerns, Wal-Mart stock rose 2.1% to $54.98; Federated
shares gained 2.6% to $30.55.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury jeweler Tiffany &amp; Co.'s said its quarterly profit jumped
46%, to $35.2 million, or 24 cents a share, helped by easy
comparisons with a year earlier, when the terrorist attacks depressed
results. Sales rose 10% to $366 million.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany said it expected fourth-quarter growth despite the
sluggish economy. Its stock jumped 7% to $26.59.</TE>
<TE>   Women's clothing retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corp. said after the
market closed that quarterly earnings more than doubled to $24.9
million, or 53 cents a share, the company's most profitable third
quarter ever as it was able to sell more clothes at full price. Sales
rose 9.5% to $340 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Taylor stock rose 3.5% to $24.25 before the announcement.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Schering-Plough Corp. said Chief Executive Richard Kogan, who is
under fire for recent private meetings with analysts and fund
managers, will retire and resign from the board by April.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Merck &amp; Co said the Justice Department is
investigating its marketing practices as part of a larger probe into
pharmaceutical companies, but noted the probe had been previously
disclosed in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Merck's news followed Schering-Plough's announcement Tuesday that
the U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts had issued two subpoenas
related to a probe of its sales and marketing practices.</LD>
<TE>   The news led to a stock slump across the pharmaceutical industry.
Schering-Plough's stock fell 87 cents, or 4%, to $20.66; Merck fell
$2.02, or 3.7%, to $52.80, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Kogan, 61, has worked at the drug firm for 20 years, having served
as CEO since 1996 for the maker of blockbuster allergy drug Claritin.</TE>

<HD>Sony and Royal Philips Acquire InterTrust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eager to establish an alternative to anti-piracy technology from
Microsoft Corp., Sony Corp. and Royal Philips Electronics on
Wednesday snapped up struggling InterTrust Technologies Corp. of
Santa Clara, Calif., for $453 million.</LD>
<LD>   The companies plan to combine their digital rights management
technologies with InterTrust's patented offerings, then make the
products widely available to other firms, officials said. The
technologies would help consumer electronics and entertainment
companies protect movies, music and other items as they're
transmitted digitally to and around the home.</LD>
<LD>   An early entrant in the field of rights management, InterTrust
once had deals to protect the digital music sold by several music
companies. But those companies have moved on to other more
user-friendly approaches, and Microsoft has emerged as the dominant
supplier of rights management technology.</LD>
<TE>   In recent months, InterTrust has focused mainly on litigation --
it's suing Microsoft for patent infringement -- and on consulting
instead of selling products.</TE>
<TE>   The goal for Philips and Sony is to create an open platform that a
wide array of companies would use to protect digital files, Philips
spokesman Jeremy Cohen said. The partners plan to make it easier for
companies to obtain InterTrust's key technologies, although they
still plan to collect licensing fees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Sony-Philips joint venture, Fidelio Acquisitions Co., made the
purchase for $4.25 per InterTrust share.</TE>
<TE>   InterTrust shares rose 89 cents to $4.26 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Managers Take Breakout Roles</HD>
<DH>Six venture out to form their own firm as the talent
business burgeons</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller and James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newest management firm in Hollywood has no name. But it has
snagged some of the biggest names in entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing a long tradition of entrepreneurial spinoffs by
representatives of actors, directors and writers, a collection of six
talent managers announced Wednesday that they had come together to
create their own business.</LD>
<LD>   Among their top-tier clients: Reese Witherspoon, Tobey Maguire,
Kirsten Dunst, Julianne Moore, Kiefer Sutherland, Mariah Carey and
"Charlie's Angels" director McG.</LD>
<TE>   It's still unclear exactly which of these stars plan to join their
managers at the new company. But most of them are expected to.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the venture's founders have been unable to agree on what
to call their new firm. And whether they can learn to work
collaboratively on even more complex issues remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a group of successful people banding together to build a
company," said manager Brian Medavoy, a partner at Immortal
Entertainment. "Whether or not they can merge those cultures into
one" is something that "no one will know until they spend time
together."</TE>
<TE>   The founders of the new firm -- none of whom agreed to be
interviewed -- are Suzan Bymel, Guymon Casady, Eric Kranzler, Evelyn
O'Neill, Daniel Rappaport and David Seltzer.</TE>
<TE>   Defections to form new companies aren't unusual, but the fallout
when clients and executives depart can be financially and emotionally
wrenching.</TE>
<TE>   Industry Entertainment has been hit hard twice. Four years ago,
two top managers left and took with them such stars as Leonardo
DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. Now, three more managers are taking
"Spider-Man" stars Maguire and Dunst.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been very candid about their desire to do their own
thing. I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't disappointed, but I
understand the entrepreneurial spirit," said Industry partner Keith
Addis, whose firm still represents Angelina Jolie, Ted Danson and
Billy Bob Thornton.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's talent agencies and management companies for years
have spawned newer ones as agents and managers get restless and
venture out on their own. The biggest talent group, Creative Artists
Agency, was founded when Michael Ovitz and some colleagues split from
the William Morris Agency in 1975. Endeavor Agency was formed when a
group of agents left International Creative Management in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The new management company is being created at a time when
managers have proliferated in Hollywood, carving out a powerful
position that sometimes puts them at odds with the talent agencies
that have long dominated the business.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike regulated agents, managers enjoy a more freewheeling
status. They orchestrate career moves and produce films and
television shows in which their clients star.</TE>
<TE>   They are prohibited by law from procuring work for clients, which
is supposed to be the exclusive job of talent agents. But talent
agencies have long alleged that many managers blur that line,
sometimes acting as de facto agents.</TE>
<TE>   The business is risky. The ambitious plans of now-defunct Artists
Management Group, founded by former agent Ovitz in 1998, failed to
materialize. Blending managers from different backgrounds also can
prove tough. What's more, the six face competition from a host of
powerful established managers, including Industry Entertainment,
Brillstein-Grey, Mosaic Media and 3 Arts Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The largest, Brillstein-Grey, boasts nearly 200 clients, such as
Brad Pitt, Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston and former New York Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   Although Industry Entertainment knew that three managers were on
their way out, partners at 3 Arts were caught off guard by
Rappaport's departure.</TE>
<TE>   "While everybody is entitled to go off and do what they want,
we're disappointed," said partner Michael Rotenberg. "We spent many
years nurturing" Rappaport.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Rappaport said he was indebted to 3 Arts. Casady,
Kranzler and Seltzer issued a similar statement saying they are
grateful to Industry. Bymel and O'Neill were partners at Talent
Entertainment Group, representing such clients as Witherspoon and
Sutherland.</TE>

<HD>Redding Doctors Keep Licenses</HD>
<DH>Medical Board fails to win the suspension of two heart
physicians at a Tenet Healthcare facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Streitfeld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two doctors who are under investigation for allegedly performing
unnecessary operations at Tenet Healthcare Corp.'s Redding Medical
Center got to keep their licenses Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Shasta County Superior Court Judge Monica Marlow ruled that the
California Medical Board's evidence against cardiologist Chae Hyun
Moon and heart surgeon Fidel Realyvasquez was insufficient to stop
them from practicing.</LD>
<LD>   "She sent a message that these kinds of proceedings cannot and
should not be based on innuendo, hearsay and double hearsay," said
William Warne, Moon's lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   Realyvasquez lawyer Robert H. Zimmerman said the board "fired a
dud."</TE>
<TE>   The board had sought temporary restraining orders in the wake of
an FBI investigation of the doctors' work, which burst into public
view two weeks ago after agents raided Redding Medical and carted
away boxes of patient files. The FBI is probing alleged Medicare
fraud, but the Medical Board was seeking the suspensions solely on
public safety grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge didn't like the evidence we had," said Dave Thornton,
the board's chief of enforcement. "But based on the nature of the
allegations, and the potential for more operations that are
unnecessary and put patients at risk, we felt we had to move
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the board would continue its investigation. "We need
to reevaluate what we have and what more we need in order to get some
kind of interim restriction or suspension of these licenses."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation has proved to be a big headache for Santa
Barbara-based Tenet, which also is having its Medicare billing
practices audited by the federal government. Neither the doctors nor
Tenet has been charged with any crime.</TE>
<TE>   It is very rare for the Medical Board to seek either a temporary
restraining order or an interim suspension order, which is a similar
proceeding. Only three restraining orders and 23 suspension orders
were granted during the board's last fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   To make its case, the Medical Board used the 67-page FBI affidavit
as well as a declaration by Vincent Yap, chief of cardiology for
Kaiser Permanente Medical Group in Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my strong professional opinion that neither Dr. Moon nor
Dr. Realyvasquez can safely practice medicine, and each poses a
threat to patients," Yap said, adding that both had committed "acts
of dishonesty or corruption."</TE>
<TE>   But Moon's lawyer, Warne, said the affidavit relied on anonymous
witnesses. "We can only guess at what these witnesses would say if
they had to swear under oath to the 'facts' as they know them." He
called Yap's declaration "disingenuous" and "a house of cards"
because, except for one patient file that the doctor independently
reviewed, he was basing all his conclusions on the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's rejection of the affidavit means that it is likely to
receive widespread critical examination. Indeed, at least one of the
claims in the affidavit appeared to weaken under a minimal amount of
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Moon is quoted as bragging to a reluctant heart patient that he
had studied at Stanford under Dr. Yak, an inventor of an
intravascular ultrasound imaging technique called IVUS. The patient
then tells the nurse "that if Moon studied under Yak," he wanted Yak
to review his records.</TE>
<TE>   "A short time later," the affidavit continues, "the nurse returned
and said that he had telephoned Stanford and that they had never
heard of a Dr. Yak."</TE>
<TE>   The patient asked the nurse to seek out Moon for clarification.
Moon then changed his statement, telling the nurse that "Yak was not
a doctor but instead was a technician." The patient, understandably,
"felt as though Moon had just lied to him."</TE>
<TE>   The incident is cited as an example of what the FBI and the
Medical Board describe as the doctors' approach to patients. Moon and
Realyvasquez "were able to carry out their scheme by lying and/or
misleading and in some cases scaring patients," the board wrote in
its court petition.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a doctor at Stanford named Paul Yock, and he did
invent IVUS. Moon was a pioneer in the use of IVUS, and according to
court papers took a continuing legal education course at Stanford in
it. Yock didn't return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, neither of the doctors was present in court. Warne
said that as of early evening, he hadn't talked to his client. Moon
"was busy treating patients," the lawyer said. "We talked to his
wife, who was elated."</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman said Realyvasquez was "obviously relieved." He noted
that the reaction to the judge's ruling from the doctors' supporters
in the courtroom "was a spontaneous roar of approval, like someone
had just scored a touchdown in the local high school football game."</TE>

<HD>Taxable Fund Yields Slide Below Tax-Exempt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a novel twist, yields on tax-exempt money market mutual funds now
are higher than yields on taxable money funds. But blink and you
might miss them.</LD>
<LD>   The average annualized yield on tax-exempt funds, which buy
short-term IOUs from municipalities, was 1.13% in the seven days
ended Monday, according to fund-tracker Imoneynet.com.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, the average yield on taxable money funds, which
typically own IOUs of companies and government agencies, was 1.05% in
the period.</LD>
<TE>   Normally, the tax-exempt status of muni securities means their
nominal yields are below those of taxable securities.</TE>
<TE>   But some recent large IOU sales by states and municipalities have
bolstered the supply of those securities relative to demand, said
Peter Crane, managing editor of Imoneynet.com.</TE>
<TE>   That has helped keep tax-free yields higher, even though all
short-term yields have been sliding since the Federal Reserve cut its
benchmark rate last week.</TE>
<TE>   For someone in the 44% combined state and federal tax bracket in
California, a 1.13% yield on a California muni fund equals a 2.02%
taxable yield.</TE>
<TE>   But Crane noted that tax-free money fund yields can be
particularly volatile. He said he doesn't expect the muni funds to
yield more than taxable funds for more than a few weeks. For
investors in lower tax brackets, that means it may not be worth
contemplating a shift from taxable funds to tax-free funds.</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity Investments said it is reopening its Low-Priced Stock
fund to new investors. The fund, which focuses on smaller stocks, was
closed in spring because of a heavy cash inflow. The fund is down
8.2% year to date, compared with the 23.1% loss for the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index.</TE>

<HD>Shake Up Democratic Insiders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth S. Baer</AU>
<BD>Kenneth S. Baer, former senior speechwriter to Vice
President Al Gore, is the author of "Reinventing Democrats: The
Politics of Liberalism from Reagan to Clinton" (University Press of
Kansas, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Democratic Party's clamor for new leadership may bring fresh
faces to the Sunday morning talk shows, but it won't bring the change
the party needs.</LD>
<LD>   In this age of highly individualized and televised politics, the
keepers and crafters of a political party's ideology, agenda and
strategy are neither congressional nor party leaders but a loose
group of consultants, pollsters and strategists. Although they hold
no elected office, these operatives have more influence on who runs
and how they run than anyone with a fancy title.</LD>
<LD>   Only by shaking up the make-up of this group of insiders will the
Democratic Party get the fresh thinking needed to awaken it from its
intellectual slumber.</LD>
<TE>   Political consulting as a full-time profession began to flourish
in the wake of the 1972 reforms that replaced the party's
smoke-filled rooms with primaries as the way to choose a party's
nominees. This not only increased the importance of individual
candidates but boosted the power of those with the specialized
knowledge of how to run a modern campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In time, political consultants became the new party bosses.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean that the national parties became irrelevant.
Rather, the advent of unregulated soft money transformed the parties
into vast holding companies of campaign cash. With money comes
influence, and the national party committees are able to steer
candidates to Beltway consultants of their choosing and intervene
directly with polling and advertising developed by these advisors.
This has democratized professional political advice, giving the
rookie congressional candidate the same access to experienced
strategists that a three-term senator has.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this nationalization of political strategy has its drawbacks,
entrenching those with long winning records and stifling the rise of
strategists with new ideas from beyond the Beltway.</TE>
<TE>   It is these outsiders who challenge the prevailing ways of doing
business and score the big victories for their parties. In this
year's elections, it explains why Democrats did so well in
gubernatorial races, winning statehouses not only in Pennsylvania,
Illinois and Michigan but also in Republican Oklahoma and Wyoming.
Although gubernatorial candidates use nationally known consultants,
they always have at the table other strategists from within their
state who not only have local knowledge but also a perspective not
skewed by the myopic world of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for the most successful presidential campaigns of
the modern era. The masterminds who orchestrated the rise of George
W. Bush -- Karl Rove, Karen Hughes and media man Mark McKinnon -- all
are Texans, none of them considered to be in the top tier of
Republican operatives even three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   When the Clinton campaign hired James Carville and Paul Begala,
they were just getting noticed for engineering Harris Wofford's
stunning victory in the 1991 Pennsylvania Senate special election.
Pollster Stan Greenberg was a political scientist known more for his
analysis of Reagan Democrats in Macomb County, Mich., than the few
winning candidates he advised. Ronald Reagan relied on his California
crew, and Jimmy Carter's improbable victory in 1976 was put together
by an almost entirely Georgian team, along with the brash young
pollster Pat Caddell.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Party suffers today because its last infusion of
new blood and new ideas happened in 1992. Since then, welfare reform
has removed race from anti-poverty debates. We have lived through a
cycle of recession, prosperity and recession. The electorate has
changed significantly, moving to the exurbs, investing in the stock
market and becoming more nonwhite. The terrorist threat has pushed
foreign affairs back to one of the top concerns of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Democrats are waging campaigns that are stuck in a time warp.
This year's mantra of protecting Social Security and fighting for a
prescription drug benefit has been overused for so long that it has
been rendered meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to get voters to pay attention is for the Democratic
Party to put together a compelling reason for why its values and
vision for the future best fit the challenges and realities Americans
face today. The first step is opening the door to the present-day
smoke-filled rooms in Washington and letting in a fresh breeze of new
ideas and new thinkers.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Trust Fund Is a Good Foundation for Affordable Housing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Feuer</AU>
<BD>Former L.A. City Council member Mike Feuer was the
chair of Mayor James K. Hahn's Housing Trust Fund Advisory Committee.
He is an attorney in Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a $42-million trust fund this year -- increasing to $100 million
in two years -- Los Angeles at last is poised to devote meaningful
resources to combating our affordable-housing crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even a sum this size will just begin to make an impact on an
emergency that has been building for decades. To make this money
count, city leaders must direct the lion's share to our greatest
need: creating as much new housing as possible, swiftly and
cost-effectively.</LD>
<LD>   This seemingly benign proposal will test city leaders' political
courage, discipline and capacity to educate and inspire L.A.'s
communities. Some powerful homeowners groups, for example, have
routinely opposed locating multiple-unit housing in their
neighborhoods -- especially housing affordable to seniors struggling
on fixed incomes or families who cannot pay skyrocketing market
rates.</LD>
<TE>   I recall vividly one extended skirmish I had as a City Council
member with a homeowners association over an affordable senior
housing development. The building is now built, occupied and
noncontroversial. But it was fought, tooth and nail, by well-
organized opponents who (as I was reminded often) vote.</TE>
<TE>   They claimed to be concerned over the "density bonus" at issue:
more units on site than had been approved years before for a
market-rate condominium, although the building itself would be
smaller than allowed. In a dynamic that plays out throughout the
city, the naysayers were vocal, visible and unmoved by data
underscoring the need for the development and its lack of negative
effect on their quality of life. Conspicuous supporters were harder
to come by. Potential tenants, for example, don't always realize they
have a stake in a building that might never be constructed.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. neighborhoods, and the officials who serve them, must learn
to say yes to such developments. It is essential that officials
educate communities on the positive contributions such projects make.
Otherwise, the housing gap between the well-to-do and working-class
families will become a chasm.</TE>
<TE>   The cold reality is that we live in a city where, according to the
2000 U.S. census, more than 370,000 housing units are overcrowded,
100,000 units are severely overcrowded and tens of thousands of
residents live in garages. L.A. needs 60,000 more housing units by
2005.</TE>
<TE>   Facts like these led housing experts -- who were convened by Mayor
James K. Hahn to advise him on the trust fund -- to place top
priority on building more affordable rental units. This committee
felt strongly that the fund's effect would dissipate if officials
failed to concentrate on this and a short list of other, secondary
goals, including preserving the affordability of existing housing
whose subsidies are threatened and easing first-time home purchases
for workers in needed professions such as nursing, teaching and
public safety.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's recommendation to focus the fund's resources could
precipitate battles on other fronts too. Some may instead want to
devote much of the fund to repairing existing units or to tenants on
the verge of eviction through no fault of their own. These are worthy
goals. And it's sometimes easier for officials to attempt to satisfy
multiple constituencies by sprinkling small amounts of money in
different directions. They must resist that temptation here.</TE>
<TE>   The money will be well spent only if most of it leverages other
public and private dollars. That means that L.A.'s trust fund should
meet or exceed the national average for similar programs: Nationwide,
$1 allocated by housing trust funds results in an additional $7 for
housing from sources ranging from tax credits to conventional
financing.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor and City Council have infused more money into a
municipal housing trust fund than leaders in any other city in the
nation. Last week, California voters passed a $2-billion statewide
housing bond measure. Handled properly, this could be a defining
moment for a city finally coming to grips with a housing crisis that
threatens our economy, transportation system and basic quality of
life.</TE>

<HD>From the Crown Jewels to Cubic Zirconia</HD>
<DH>Britannia rules the scandal sheets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hiscock</AU>
<BD>John Hiscock is a Los Angeles-based British journalist
who writes for the London Daily Telegraph.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As royal scandals go, it makes Henry VIII's multiple marriages and
King Edward VIII's decision to give up the throne for an American
divorcee look like mere peccadilloes.</LD>
<LD>   Like a giant tsunami, it started innocuously enough, just after
Paul Burrell was cleared of charges that he stole memorabilia from
the home of Princess Diana, where he had served as butler. Burrell,
whose trial was underway, was saved by Queen Elizabeth II's belated
memory of a conversation the two had soon after Diana's death in
1997.</LD>
<LD>   So -- perhaps smarting from his long ordeal in the dock, perhaps
realizing that the clock was ticking on his 15 minutes of fame --
Burrell opted to spill the secrets of Diana's life and extramarital
affairs in an English tabloid newspaper in return for a reported fee
of $500,000.</LD>
<TE>   Each day since, the British public has been learning new details
about how "the people's princess" smuggled boyfriends into her home
at Kensington Palace in the trunk of her car; how she greeted one of
them wearing only a fur coat and high heels and how Prince Philip
wrote her letters that were more vicious than the death threats she
received.</TE>
<TE>   All good salacious fun for eager sensation-seekers and one of the
jollier, it seemed, of a series of scandals that have plagued the
House of Windsor during the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Burrell's seamy tales of what the butler saw have opened a
Pandora's box containing much more serious accusations of debauchery,
moral bankruptcy and chicanery, exposing how rotten and corrupt
things are at Buckingham Palace. With every sordid revelation, there
is more fodder for the anti-royalists and more calls for independent
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Never before has there been such a breakdown of trust in a
once-honored institution. If the queen's sudden intervention was
meant to keep Burrell from revealing palace secrets from the witness
box, it failed miserably because he is now doing so in far more
detail in the pages of a newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   At the latest count, the charge sheet includes allegations that
Buckingham Palace attempted to cover up the gay rape of a servant by
one of Prince Charles' close aides and that the prince's personal
assistant, Michael Fawcett, is known as "Fawcett the Fence" because
he allegedly sells off gifts given to Charles at shops around London,
keeping up to 20% of the proceeds as his cut.</TE>
<TE>   As one member of Parliament put it, it is bad enough that Prince
Charles goes abroad at public expense and receives valuable gifts;
the last thing anyone expects is for him to come back, have them sold
off or pawned and then pocket the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the scabrous mix is the so-called "rape tape," a
mysterious missing recording said to have been made by Diana and
containing the raped servant's story of his ordeal. Police who
searched Burrell's home after a tip-off failed to find the recording.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell is paying a price for his revelations: The British
tabloids who did not get his memoir have turned on him with a
vengeance, uncovering further details of "gay romps" with palace
servants and implicating Burrell himself in some of the alleged
goings-on. Burrell is now in the United States, giving television
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Charles has promised an internal inquiry into some of the
allegations, but observers believe that will merely add to suspicions
of a cover-up. This is no longer about a former butler's tell-all
tattling. It is about the future of the British monarchy -- and
whether it has one.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, there are rumblings from the public and Labor
members of Parliament that most countries get by without a monarch
and, indeed, the U.S. has thrived and still attracts tourists 200
years after getting rid of its ties to royalty. So why shouldn't
Britain?</TE>
<TE>   The whole unsavory affair confirms what many have long suspected
about the increasingly dysfunctional royal family: It is not even fit
to run a fish and chip shop.</TE>

<LD>"My husband woke up this morning singing 'O Canada,' " said the
well-to-do woman sitting on my left in the theater last week. "What a
terrible night," she added ruefully.</LD>
<LD>   This caught me short. What was she talking about? Had I missed
some late-breaking news about the death of Prime Minister Jean
Chretien? Had terrorists attacked Toronto?</LD>
<LD>   Then I realized. She meant the previous day's midterm elections in
the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Apparently the specter of jackbooted Republicans banging home
their belligerent agenda in Congress untrammeled by sensible dissent
had turned her husband into an expatriate overnight. To survive the
coming coup d'etat, he would have to emigrate. Or joke about it, as
would his wife, who would be dining out on that gibe for months.</TE>
<TE>   I know this woman. She is a solidly upper-middle-class,
stay-at-home mother of two whose husband has a cushy job in the arts.
They own a large, well- appointed Victorian home on a pricey chunk of
real estate in the quaint suburbs. They are living the American
dream, but their politics haven't caught up yet.</TE>
<TE>   You know the type: hippies come of age who are, alas, emblematic
of our age. And, courtesy of journalist David Brooks, they have a
name: bobos, or bourgeois bohemians. Their political peacockery also
has a name; Tom Wolfe called it radical chic. They are a less
stratospheric, though no less mouthy, version of certain Hollywood
celebrities whose hyperbolic and deeply hypocritical criticisms of
"Amerika" under the Bush administration seem to grow more shrill and
ridiculous every day.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, for example, Tom Cruise's recent assertion that the U.S.
is a "frightening" place to live or Alec Baldwin's purported promise
(as yet unfulfilled) to leave the country if Bush won in 2000 or
Woody Harrelson's claim that taking military action against Iraq
would be imperialist? This from men who live like gods off the fruits
of the greedy, oppressive empire they impugn.</TE>
<TE>   The quip of my fellow theatergoer was hardly less absurd or
irritating. Had it come from a convenience store clerk, a ditch
digger or another practitioner of thankless labor who could make a
more plausible case for having been shafted by the supposedly
Republican-run capitalist, classist hegemony, I might have accepted
it as legitimate. But such extremist cries seem to emanate less often
or noticeably from day laborers than from the comfy berths of
"progressives."</TE>
<TE>   An inverse relationship seems to exist between how good this
country has been to certain people and the flimsiness of the pretexts
on which they not only disparage but also betray it -- in spirit and
careless words, if not in deeds.</TE>
<TE>   The trifling outrage of the cushioned classes rings hollow when
you consider that their rarified lives are predicated on many of the
conservative policies they bewail most loudly. They consume -- often
guzzle -- the same oil and gas that they demand we should never do
anything environmentally or politically compromising to procure. They
float as surely as the rest of us on an economy made viable by
corporations to whose plundering interests (apparently) Republicans
alone cater.</TE>
<TE>   They relish the peace and quiet their McMansions afford but
pooh-pooh the military spending and realpolitik that preserve them in
a post-Sept. 11 world. Like spoiled Hamlets, they whine that
"Denmark's a prison," yet never make good on their peevish threats to
flee.</TE>
<TE>   And why? Because, of course, their blather is just another form of
decadence.</TE>
<TE>   In their milder moments, they know that their lives presuppose and
sustain the fiscal, environmental and foreign policies that this
country has embraced to only nominally different degrees under both
Democrats and Republicans for generations. That's why Gore Vidal was
right for once when he said that America's political system has just
one party with two right wings.</TE>
<TE>   Society firebrands have nothing to fear from a Republican sweep,
except maybe a reality check.</TE>

<LD>An audiotape presumed to be from Osama bin Laden and obviously meant
to unsettle the United States and its allies actually serves as a
reminder of the proven benefits of international cooperation against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The tape, delivered like previous missives to the Arabic-language
Al Jazeera television network, hails the Oct. 12 terrorist bombing in
Bali, Indonesia, where nearly 200 people were killed, and Chechen
rebels' Oct. 26 seizure of about 750 Moscow theatergoers, in which
all of the rebels and more than 100 of their victims were killed
during Russian efforts to free the hostages. The voice condemns the
United States and Israel -- Bin Laden's usual targets -- and assails
Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Germany and Australia for "attacking
us in Afghanistan."</LD>
<LD>   Adherents to the twisted version of Islam preached by Bin Laden
will welcome the tape as evidence he is alive. Most of the rest of
the world can derive some satisfaction from the progress made in
weakening Bin Laden's network over the last year.</LD>
<TE>   Recent reports that Taliban and Al Qaeda members are regrouping in
Pakistan and warnings of possible terrorist attacks in Europe are
reminders of the need for vigilance and action. But in today's world,
potential targets understand the threat and are acting against it.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 nations have cooperated in seizing extremist
organizations' funds, sharing intelligence and arresting individuals.
One notable success was the September arrest of Ramzi Binalshibh in
Pakistan, a joint effort of U.S. and Pakistani law enforcement.
Binalshibh was a roommate of hijacker Mohamed Atta and has called
himself the coordinator of the 9/11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   An even bigger success has been driving Al Qaeda from its
headquarters in Afghanistan and removing from power its protector,
the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The delivery of an audiotape -- but no video -- may indicate that
Bin Laden is ill or has changed his appearance. In any case, the
alarming rhetoric remains intact and has been expanded to portray
Iraq as the target of an anti-Muslim campaign by the United States
and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   True, the failure of U.S. forces to capture Bin Laden stings. If
he indeed is alive, he remains a voice of support for bomb makers and
hostage takers. Dead, he would be a martyr to his believers. Either
way, followers bent on terrorism -- at his order or acting on their
own -- need to be identified, stopped and prosecuted. With many
nations continuing to pool their efforts, the chances of success are
multiplied.</TE>

<HD>Pill Plan Could Be a Disaster</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just how stupid can Californians be? The way the state figures it,
too stupid to follow simple instructions that would save their lives
in a nuclear disaster. That attitude is more than insulting -- it
endangers people who need to protect themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The state had planned to give two potassium iodide pills to each
of about 200,000 people living within 10 miles of the San Onofre
nuclear plant, to use in case of radiation exposure. Some 20,000
residents near the Diablo Canyon plant along the Central California
coast also would receive them.</LD>
<LD>   Although potassium iodide doesn't offer full protection, it can
keep the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine, which causes
thyroid cancer. But now the distribution is on hold because the state
Office of Emergency Services has some concerns. The worries: Once the
emergency broadcast went out, people would take the pills and stay at
home, figuring they were safe from radiation. And how would tourists
and kids in school get their doses?</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it's better, state officials think, to put the pills in
hospitals more than 10 miles from the plants, thus encouraging people
to leave the reactor areas.</TE>
<TE>   Can state officials possibly believe that people would relax in a
hot tub at home while sirens wail and television continuously calls
on them to evacuate immediately?</TE>
<TE>   The state should read the Food and Drug Administration's document
to government agencies on the subject. "For optimal protection
against inhaled radioiodines," it says, potassium iodide "should be
administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the
radioactive cloud, though [it] may still have a substantial
protective effect even if taken three or four hours after exposure."
In other words, minutes matter.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a far more likely scenario: Everyone tries to leave at
once. Cars clog the roadways out of San Clemente and Dana Point. It
takes them hours to advance a few miles, hours during which people
could have had protection the government denied them. Some people,
because of ill health or lack of transportation, wait for evacuation,
frantically watching the hours tick away. People eventually get to
the designated hospitals. They can't park anywhere close. They
abandon their cars and walk. Then wait in long lines while harried
clerks consult a computer to see whether the would-be patient lives
within the 10-mile radius.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission offered the pills nearly a year ago to the 34 states that
have nuclear power reactors. California took six months to accept the
offer. By then the over-the-counter pills already had been
distributed to neighbors of nuclear plants in seven other states. Now
California is holding up the process while it contemplates replacing
a simple plan with one that is complex and potentially catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   By all means, stockpile extra doses in schools and hospitals. At
pennies each, they're cheap enough. But each day this agency delays
in giving people these semiprotective pills strains public faith in
the state's own competence.</TE>

<LD>We've long known the power of pictures -- cave drawings, paintings,
photographs -- to portage a moment in time safely and silently to the
eyes and imaginations of future viewers. The messages within
Renaissance oils, Civil War photos, even Oregon Trail graffiti ignite
wonder about history. What did George Washington really look like and
Abraham Lincoln really sound like? How would history differ if, say,
security pictures had revealed the nervousness of President
McKinley's approaching assassin and as a result left Theodore
Roosevelt in vice presidential obscurity?</LD>
<LD>   The march of technology -- phonographs, movies, TV and tape
recordings -- captured new species of moments, from police and
bystander videos to cockpit chatter and mere snapshots of families,
even pets. Each evokes emotions. Each elicits the omniscience of
20/20 hindsight. Unlike the innocent faces there, we know what has
happened subsequently. It's captivating -- and eerie.</LD>
<TE>   Now comes another 9/11 aural image, a tape recording newly
released by New York authorities. We've already been touched by the
calm and fearful farewells left on home answering machines by trapped
World Trade Center workers. The new tape sounds mundane. It contains
the professional radio exchanges of no-nonsense firefighters and
police officers in the business of human rescues. They're regular
voices, with New Yawk accents, reporting to colleagues and superiors
on locations, observations, equipment. They're on a certain floor.
They see this, hear that. Then, we realize one of the speakers is out
of breath. Of course he is after climbing two-score floors in smoke,
dust and noise against a fleeing tide of humanity.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the clarity of hindsight kicks in. We know today what
they didn't then. That soon after they were spoken, these
conscientious, innocent, even naive words became outrageously
outdated. The import of such simple reports would be magnified many
times as the people who spoke them plummeted into posthumous fame as
heroes. Even the most routine "10-4" is coated by our painfully
detailed knowledge of the scale of what was happening in that place
to these people who didn't know. Can we feel guilty for watching then
and listening now?</TE>
<TE>   Like all post-disaster forensics, the tapes offer useful lessons
for vastly improved emergency strategies, building methods and crisis
communications. The surviving witnesses -- and they are basically all
of us still here today going about the daily routine as if our
tomorrows are innumerable -- may be pierced by the pathos of
hindsight. Looking back does that at first. But at some point in
time, that awful hollow ache of hindsight can become the fortifying
wisdom of foresight. Perhaps the unspoken message today of these
simple words from last year is: That point in time is now.</TE>

<LD>We've recently cleaned out our garage and decided to call one of the
many groups that ask for donations. We marked the items and put them
in the driveway for pickup. The truck pulled up and, with little more
than a cursory look at what we were donating, the workers got back
into the truck, saying, "Nope, not interested." We then called
another "needy group" but were not home when their people came to
call. They left a door hanger on our front door with the curt note:
"Sorry, not good. Not salebal." (Their spelling!)</LD>
<LD>   Ladies and gentlemen, if they were good, I wouldn't be giving them
away! I had thought that many of these so-called "thrift stores" have
needy people who need jobs and will work and repair items to make
them salable. Or am I mistaken about what they really want and what
their people do?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Liberal Leader for a Liberal Party," Commentary, Nov. 12: Ross
Baker ignores the basic difference between the Republican and
Democratic parties and the reason why Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) now leads the Democrats. He cites African Americans' and
union members' support and ignores the fact that a majority of women
support the Democratic Party. The gender gap has persisted since it
first began to be tracked in 1980. The selection of Pelosi, the first
woman to lead a national party, is simply a recognition of this
fundamental difference between the parties.</LD>
<LD>   Basic to that difference is a woman's right to choose. The Supreme
Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade -- which gave women that right in
1973 -- was not limited to abortion rights but signaled that basic
human rights must include a woman's right to participate on an equal
basis with men in our social, economic and political lives. With
Pelosi leading the Democratic Party, it's the women's votes that will
make the difference in the 2004 election.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Be Careful What You Wish For," by Robert Scheer, Commentary,
Nov. 12: It seems, Mr. Scheer, you don't share the same joy that the
voters had in the GOP platform on election day. The Democrats'
tax-and-spend policies of social engineering, safety nets and
entitlements don't work now and won't work in 2004. Because the
electorate is split 50/50, you need some conservatives to buy into
those philosophies now.</TE>
<TE>   The Dems had better go back to the drawing board to find something
that will appeal to this new electorate; otherwise, it's going to be
a long decade.</TE>

<TE>   The Democrats lost because, instead of insisting that resisting
terrorism necessarily includes support of the Bill of Rights, social
programs and the aggressive prosecution of corporate crime, they did
little but echo the president. It doesn't take a political scientist
to know that the faster they run to the right the more they guarantee
us a Republican dynasty.</TE>

<LD>Re "No Rap on Eminem," Nov. 11: Have we really crossed over into
never-never land, where we believe that the person on the silver
screen is the "real" person? Eminem is a "doll"? Everything the guy
has done for years proves he is closer to a Nazi than a doll. Yet the
moviegoers think the guy on the screen in "8 Mile" is the real Eminem
... nice, hard-working, likes kids. Detroit shaped Marshall Mathers
III, and he let the world know it with his verses about women, his
mother, drugs, gays and violence. Have moviegoers lost their minds?
Taking a 12-year-old to this movie is like telling him or her: "Go
for it. Do whatever you want. Take any risk, hate anyone you are
afraid of."</LD>
<LD>   Eminem's music is real; it is his songwriting, his words, his
thoughts. But the movie is fake. It cost $41 million to make; someone
has written a part for Mathers to play. He must play it well -- the
sheep are crowding through the gates. In a world full of violence,
now we want the bad guys to reform, and we want to believe they were
only kidding. Sorry, I'm not buying it.</LD>

<TE>   Eminem is anything but the cute, sweet "doll" that Jane Ann Kuster
described him as. Through his lyrics Eminem has made it clear that he
hates women and that he has a deep hatred for homosexuals. On the
verge of war and with there being much prejudice against those of
Middle Eastern descent, it is important that tolerance be promoted
and that we not reward bigotry by supporting a misogynist and
homophobe by seeing his film. Eminem has a right to free speech, but
his right does not deny everyone in America the right to live
comfortably. No matter how superb his acting may be, I will not give
Eminem $8.50 (the price of a movie ticket) until he changes his
attitude toward women and homosexuals. I am ashamed that so many are
willing to put his acting ability above his intolerance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Pediatric Trials Only Drive Up Prices" by Henry I. Miller
(Commentary, Nov. 4) distorts the facts and ignores what
pediatricians know to be true: Children are not small adults and
their bodies react to medicine differently than adults' bodies do.
The fact is, pediatricians uniformly agree that the lack of formal
drug testing in children is a problem. The fact is, too, that the
Food and Drug Administration has made it clear that the pediatric
rule, which requires drug companies to test in children medicines
they market for adults, will not slow approval of drugs for adults.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to Miller's opinion, many parents, especially those of
children with chronic or life-threatening illness, or both, are
willing to enroll their children in carefully controlled studies to
help ensure that the very best, most effective and safest therapies
can be found to treat their children -- and benefit children
throughout the world.</LD>
<LD>   We are writing on behalf of our colleagues at Childrens Hospital
Los Angeles. We strongly support the formal and timely study of
medications in children, we applaud the efforts of the FDA and
Congress to address the need for pediatric drug testing, and we
encourage Congress to enact into law the pediatric rule.</LD>

<LD>It is a shame that firefighters on the Los Padres Hot Shots are under
investigation for pictures being hung in a fire truck ("A
Pinup-Picture Dispute Burns Out of Control," Opinion, Nov. 10). The
men and one woman of the station approved of each other's pictures
before hanging them on the walls and ceiling of the rig. The magazine
cutouts are fun and personalize the fire truck for this team.</LD>
<LD>   As long as Monika Miller (the only female on the squad) and the
other firemen are not insulted by any of the pictures, then the
cutouts should be hung. Whoever "got a peek" at the inside of the
fire rig should be ashamed about causing all of this commotion over a
few pictures. Hanging the pictures is like a student decorating his
or her dorm room. I hope society has something better to do than
harass its heroes.</LD>

people you thought would be the best leaders? I am a native
Californian living in Canada, and the people I've spoken with here
seem to think that Californians are the only ones who made the right
choice at the ballot box.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bishops Change Tone on Abuse," Nov. 12: During medieval times,
the Roman Catholic Church was an independent power. The pope's
Vatican was a large nation and his cardinals were treated as
ambassadors of a foreign state. Bishops had their own princely
domains. Even the local parish priest was immune from trial in civil
and criminal courts. Today, the pope is trying to revive feudalism by
insisting that priests who sexually molest children be handled
according to his canon law rather than according to our government's
criminal and civil laws. Now that American bishops have endorsed the
pope's demands, justice for the victims will be found only if the
crimes are immediately reported directly to the police and not to the
church.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After more than a year of meetings among the Catholic hierarchy,
investigations regarding the use of canon law and concern for saving
the reputations of priest offenders, the bottom line remains: Wearing
a Roman collar does not excuse a sex offender. The law of the land
reaches out to all, whether it mars their reputations or not.</TE>

<LD>Re "Arab Neighbors Grieve With Kibbutzniks for Slain," Nov. 12: As
Israelis, we are witness to almost daily terrorist attacks. But the
attack on Kibbutz Metzer on Sunday night was horrific, even by our
standards. Yesterday we watched Avi Ohayon, father of Matan, 5, and
Noam, 4, as he tried to make sense of this loathsome crime. He was
interviewed on TV as he held two pacifiers belonging to these two
innocent children.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't talk of blaming his government or the terrorists. He
wondered what kind of person could shoot these two children as they
lay sleeping with pacifiers in their hands. The scene was one of the
most difficult I remember seeing during the past years. He said that
he was far too young to say Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead,
for his sons. As I write, tears again well up in my eyes. This
unforgettable sight will remain with us for a long time.</LD>

<HD>Philip Dye, 72; Led Private Network of Pinecrest Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip H. Dye, a teacher and headmaster who took over the private,
for-profit Pinecrest Schools that his late mother founded half a
century ago in suburban Los Angeles, has died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Dye, who became Pinecrest owner and academic director in 1972,
died Sunday of undisclosed causes in Mission Hills.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, 50 years after his mother, Edna Mae Dye, created the
first Pinecrest School on six acres in Van Nuys formerly owned by
actor Robert Cummings, Dye told The Times, "We started catering to
the working parent early on."</LD>
<TE>   For the first decade, the school boarded its students and catered
to the film industry, educating and caring for children of such
entertainment industry figures as director Arch Oboler while he went
to Africa to shoot "Bwana Devil."</TE>
<TE>   Other early Pinecrest parents who placed their children in the
Dyes' care were Jack Webb, creator and star of television's
"Dragnet," and songwriter Bobby Troup, who became famous for his
"Route 66" and wrote Pinecrest's school song.</TE>
<TE>   The institution ceased its boarding operation by the end of the
1950s but continued to concentrate on serving families whose parents
have long commutes and workdays. As more mothers joined the
workforce, Pinecrest expanded to 11 campuses throughout the San
Fernando, Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys.</TE>
<TE>   The company now enrolls more than 6,000 students from preschool
through middle school and offers classes and 12 hours of child care
per day as well as summer sessions and day camps.</TE>
<TE>   Dye, whose brother Donald supervised the business end of the
operation, started working as an elementary school teacher at the
original Van Nuys campus. In 1958, he opened and served as headmaster
of the second campus in Northridge. He was active on the Pinecrest
board of directors from that year until 2000.</TE>
<TE>   As a teacher and administrator, Dye watched early education evolve
from "nursery" to "day care" to the term he preferred, "preschool."</TE>
<TE>   As early as 30 years ago, he was cautioning public school
kindergartens to "reevaluate and jack up" their programs to meet the
needs of the increasing numbers of children learning educational
skills in burgeoning preschools.</TE>
<TE>   "Our teachers are trained in teaching a pre-kindergarten
curriculum that includes basic academic skills like writing names and
learning the alphabet," he said in 1993. "That is the advantage that
a child has in attending a preschool: He gets better preparation,
academically."</TE>
<TE>   Dye is survived by his wife, Betty; three children, Philip, Daria
and Corey; and six grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>Tracy Coley, 38, singer, actor, gospel choir conductor and co-founder
of the Amazing Grace Conservatory, died Saturday in Los Angeles of
complications after surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Atlanta, Coley grew up singing in choirs and earned a
music degree at Morehouse College, where he was featured soloist with
the Glee Club. Moving to Los Angeles, he appeared on such television
series as "The Wayan Brothers," "In the House," "Martin" and "The
Jamie Foxx Show" and in movies including "Blood and Concrete" and
"Notes in a Minor Key." He sang as an opening act for concerts by
Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole.</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps Coley's greatest achievement was his work with young
people, notably through the conservatory, a performing arts school he
founded with actress Wendy Raquel Robinson in 1995. Coley also
directed youth choirs at New Philadelphia A.M.E. Church and First
A.M.E. Church in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Soon after its founding, the conservatory had enrolled 75 young
actors, ages 8 to 20, and cast them in plays produced at the Los
Angeles Theatre Center. Among the productions was the musical "Anny
Mae and Asbury," which Coley wrote and directed. The plot involves
two orphans who find hope and true friendship as they are shuttled
among foster and group homes.</TE>

<HD>Eddie Worth, 93; AP Photographer Covered WWII, War Trials</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Worth, a news photographer who covered the battles for Western
Europe after D-day and went on to cover the war trials of Nazi
leaders, died Sunday at the age of 93. The cause of death was not
announced.</LD>
<LD>   Colleagues in London said Worth, who worked for the Associated
Press for most of his career, had a knack for getting to the most
difficult assignments.</LD>
<LD>   "He was one of the great photographers. A legend," said Horst
Faas, AP's senior photo editor based in London.</LD>
<TE>   Worth's first big success came when he hired a plane to obtain
pictures of a mine disaster in northern England. As an AP
photographer, he covered the events leading up to World War II and
got to know some top Nazi leaders, including Foreign Minister Joachim
von Ribbentrop.</TE>
<TE>   One of Worth's most famous images is of the dome of St. Paul's
Cathedral in London looming through the smoke and fire after a German
bombing raid June 7, 1941.</TE>
<TE>   Worth was a combat photographer during the war, landing with
Canadian troops in Normandy during the D-day invasion. He accompanied
Allied troops for the rest of the war, covering the battles for
France and northern Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The Nazi mayor of Hamburg surrendered to Worth, mistaking him for
a British officer, at the end of the war, colleagues said.</TE>
<TE>   Worth was sent to cover the trial of Nazi leaders in Nuremberg
after the war. He continued to cover trouble spots, including the
unrest in Cyprus in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "He couldn't walk; he'd run everywhere. He was in perpetual
motion," recalled Gerry Warhurst, a retired AP photo editor who
worked with Worth.</TE>

<HD>Zakaria Erzinclioglu, 50; Childhood Interests Led to
Forensic Entomology</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"There are many paths to the truth," Zakaria Erzinclioglu, Britain's
leading forensic entomologist, was fond of saying.</LD>
<LD>   For Erzinclioglu, who helped solve more than 200 murders over the
last quarter-century, the path to the truth was paved with flies and
maggots.</LD>
<LD>   Erzinclioglu, whose application of insect biology to the
investigation of crimes earned him an international reputation, died
Sept. 26 of a heart attack in England, although his death was not
immediately reported in the London press. He was 50.</LD>
<TE>   In simple language, the self-described "maggotologist" provided
the scientific basis for his expertise in his book "Maggots, Murder
and Men: Memories and Reflections of a Forensic Entomologist," which
was published in the United States in January: "When a body begins to
decompose, it releases volatile compounds with particular chemical
compositions. These are the odors that attract a fly to a corpse."</TE>
<TE>   Once the odors disappear, typically within a few weeks of death
"whether the body is buried or not," flies ignore the corpse, he
wrote. By calculating the age of the flies and the fly larvae found
on the body, a forensic entomologist can determine with a high degree
of confidence when the person died.</TE>
<TE>   The enormous number and variety of insects -- Britain has about
5,000 fly species -- also can help investigators trace a body's
movements.</TE>
<TE>   If an insect found only indoors or in one region shows up on a
body discovered in another area, for example, forensic entomologists
can conclude "the body had been lying somewhere else, buried and
exhumed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Flies also will be attracted to wounds. And, according to
Erzinclioglu, "even if the wound has been eaten away and there is
nothing to see when the body is found, the evidence of maggots can
hint at a possible cause of death."</TE>
<TE>   Erzinclioglu received his first call from the police in the early
1970s seeking somebody who was familiar with maggots. The
Hungarian-born Erzinclioglu, affectionately dubbed "Dr. Zak" by
police and others who had difficulty pronouncing his name, averaged a
dozen calls a year from police detectives seeking his expertise.</TE>
<TE>   The better-known crimes Erzinclioglu helped solve include that of
Robert "Smelly Bob" Black, who was convicted in 1994 of murdering and
raping three girls.</TE>
<TE>   Police also consulted Erzinclioglu during the 1985 investigation
of the murder of a 14-year-old boy by members of a pedophile ring.
Erzinclioglu provided evidence that showed the boy had been killed
indoors rather than in the woods where his body was found.</TE>
<TE>   Erzinclioglu also helped convict Dr. Sampson Perera, a dental
lecturer accused of murdering a 13-year-old girl whom he had
illegally adopted and kept as a slave. Perera, according to news
accounts, chopped the girl's body into pieces and then hid them
around his laboratory, house and garden.</TE>
<TE>   After the remains were found, Perera claimed they were sterile
bones he used for medical research. But Erzinclioglu identified a
type of fly that was still on some of the bones, thus proving that
the body had been recently dismembered.</TE>
<TE>   He also helped Welsh police identify the skeletal remains of a
teenage girl. By examining insect material discovered near the
remains, he was able to determine that she had been dead at least
five years. The police were able to narrow their search through
missing-person reports and subsequently identify the remains.</TE>
<TE>   By studying the developmental stage of the maggots found in the
body of another young woman, Erzinclioglu was able to estimate the
day she died. With that information, police investigators turned
their attention to a male friend of the victim who had been seen with
her that day. The friend later confessed to having stabbed the woman
57 times.</TE>
<TE>   "His ability to examine a body and conclusively determine the day
of death was such-and-such has saved police a tremendous amount of
time," Clive Jones, a retired Welsh detective chief superintendent,
told the Associated Press last year. "How on earth can you conduct an
investigation, interview suspects and eliminate people on alibi if
you don't know when the victim died?"</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hungary in 1951 to parents of Turkish origin, Erzinclioglu
grew up in Egypt, the Sudan and England, where he contracted polio,
which left him with a limp.</TE>
<TE>   After earning a degree in applied zoology from Wolverhampton
Polytechnic in 1975, he worked from 1976 to 1981 for the Zoological
Society of London as a compiler for the Zoological Record. He then
studied for his doctorate at Durham University, writing his thesis on
blowfly eggs and larvae and their development.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, he moved to Cambridge University, where he worked in the
zoology department and wrote about blowflies for the Naturalists'
Handbooks series, as well as writing for other publications. He also
received funding to do research in forensic entomology and later was
appointed director of a new Forensic Research Center at Durham
University.</TE>
<TE>   Erzinclioglu said his interest in forensic entomology grew out of
two childhood loves.</TE>
<TE>   "I was one of those little horrors who kept bringing
creepy-crawlies into the house, to the disgust of my elders," he
wrote for a London Times educational supplement in April. "I was also
a great fan of Sherlock Holmes. The two passions came together in
forensic entomology."</TE>
<TE>   The soft-spoken Erzinclioglu was someone who could observe that
"viewed dispassionately, a dead human body is a magnificent and
highly nutritious resource" and assert that there is "a great deal of
beauty" in the blowflies and other insects whose maggots flourish on
decaying flesh.</TE>
<TE>   But he was well aware that the work of a forensic entomologist
does not appeal to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   He told the Associated Press last year that on a typical
assignment he would "put on protective clothing ... and approach the
body. It is infested with maggots, and flies are buzzing about in the
room."</TE>
<TE>   But no matter how unpleasant, he said, "the last aspects of your
life have to be dealt with as well."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Sharon; a son; and two daughters.</TE>

<HD>Bali Bomb Plotter 'Delighted' With Results</HD>
<DH>During questioning done in front of reporters, Indonesian
waves and smiles. On a videotape, he shows no remorse at 191 deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENPASAR, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Confessed Bali bomb plotter Amrozi, laughing and joking as
Indonesia's top cop questioned him about his role in the Oct. 12
attack, said Wednesday that he was "delighted" with the results of
the blast.</LD>
<LD>   In an odd show staged for the media, reporters were invited to
watch through the windows of the room as national Police Chief Dai
Bachtiar conducted the interrogation. Amrozi, who like many
Indonesians goes by only one name, waved and smiled for the cameras.</LD>
<LD>   The public interrogation apparently was designed to demonstrate to
skeptical Indonesians that Amrozi has been acting under his own free
will in confessing that he took part in the bombing to further the
agenda of extremist Muslims. The blast killed 191 people, many of
them foreign tourists.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference shortly afterward, police showed a video of
Amrozi in which he apologized to his family for involving them in the
plot -- but not to any of his victims or their families.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old auto mechanic, who authorities say once fought in
Afghanistan against the Soviet occupation, was arrested last week
after police traced the ownership of the van used in the bombing and
found that he was the last owner.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi has revealed many details of the bombing, including
evidence that the attack was orchestrated by Jemaah Islamiah, a
Southeast Asian terror network connected to Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda organization.</TE>
<TE>   Bachtiar told reporters that a key organizer and financier of the
bombing was the shadowy terror suspect Imam Samudra, who has been
wanted since early 2001 for his role in a series of deadly church
bombings across Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra, who also goes by the names Azis, Dicky and Hudama, is an
associate of Hambali, a top Jemaah Islamiah leader and Al Qaeda
operative who has been involved in terror plots in the region for
nearly a decade. Police say Samudra and Hambali worked closely
together on the 2000 Christmas Eve church bombings, which killed 19
people in 10 cities.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi, who has confessed to police that he helped plant the Bali
bomb, was recruited two years ago by Samudra to begin making
explosives for extremist Muslims fighting Christians in Indonesia's
Molucca Islands, the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   Several months ago, a member of the Bali bombing plot identified
only as Idris delivered the equivalent of about $5,000 to Amrozi so
he could buy the minivan and chemicals used in the attack, according
to the confession, Bachtiar said.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 6, Amrozi delivered the van and chemicals to Samudra in
Bali. Contrary to earlier reports, Bachtiar said Amrozi did not help
make the bomb or detonators, which were triggered by cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi returned to his home village of Tenggulun before the
attack, according to his confession. The first he learned of the
bombing was on the morning of Oct. 13 when he heard on the radio at 7
a.m. that the bomb had gone off, he said. Amrozi said he laughed so
hard at the news that his wife asked him what was so funny.</TE>
<TE>   Since his arrest, Amrozi has implicated his brother Ali Imron and
led police to the Al-Islam boarding school in his village, which
police investigators say was the base for members of the terror
group.</TE>
<TE>   Police are hunting for three of Amrozi's brothers, Gufron, Ali
Fauzi and Ali Imron, who were all associated with the school. Another
brother who lives in the village, Tafsir, has been detained for
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another brother, Chozin, who helped found the Al-Islam school,
and school director Muhammad Zakaria were detained for questioning
and released for lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   In his videotaped message, Amrozi sought to deflect blame from his
family and said that the only one of his brothers involved in the
plot was Ali Imron.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask for my relatives who are running away or hiding from this
incident to return home," he said, "because if you are not involved
in this incident, hopefully the police will prove your innocence and
will not arrest or detain you."</TE>

<LD>A U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague ordered cardiology and
psychiatric exams for former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic amid
concern that his refusal to name a defense lawyer is harming his
health and disrupting his trial.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic, 61, has a heart condition and high blood pressure, and
his ill health has delayed the proceedings by more than a month since
he was brought to The Hague in June 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has asked the court to appoint a
lawyer for Milosevic, who has rejected the proposal as "illegal,
absurd and evil-minded."</LD>

followed a year of observation of 25 people suspected of founding
Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a radical group that calls for the creation of a
Muslim state in Central Asia, said Job Tilmann of the Frankfurt
prosecutor's office.</LD>

<HD>Parliament Gets Blair's Justice Reform Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Tony Blair's government promised major reforms to
Britain's justice system Wednesday, including stripping some suspects
of the right not to be tried twice for the same crime.</LD>
<LD>   The Criminal Justice Bill, announced by Queen Elizabeth II as she
opened a new session of Parliament, would "rebalance the system in
favor of the victim," Blair said. Reading a government-drafted
speech, the queen, wearing a white gown and jeweled crown, outlined
the legislative plans to lawmakers. The proposals call for juries to
be told details of defendants' previous convictions and for scrapping
the centuries-old "double jeopardy" ban on suspects facing retrial
after being acquitted of a crime. Also planned is the indefinite
jailing of serious offenders.</LD>

<LD>Leaders of a Colombian rebel group listed as a terrorist organization
by the U.S. were charged with drug trafficking and kidnapping
Americans, in federal indictments unsealed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The charges were brought against members of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which is battling the Colombian
government.</LD>
<LD>   Jorge Briceno, a.k.a. Mono Jojoy, described as the military
commander of the FARC, is charged with conspiring to kidnap Americans
Jerel Shaffer and Earl Goen from a Venezuelan fishing camp in 1997.
Shaffer was held hostage for nine months, until a $1-million ransom
was paid. Goen was freed quickly.</LD>

<LD>Excerpts from Iraq's letter:</LD>
<LD>   In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful.</LD>
<LD>   "Go thou to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds.
But speak to him mildly; perchance he may take warning or fear." --
Allah</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,</TE>
<TE>   You may recall the huge clamor fabricated by the president of the
United States administration, in the biggest and most wicked slander
against Iraq, supported in malicious intent, and spearheaded in word
and malevolence, by his lackey Tony Blair, when they disseminated the
claim that Iraq had perhaps produced, or was on its way to produce,
nuclear weapons during the time when the United Nations inspectors
had been absent from Iraq since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Then they returned to stress that Iraq had in fact produced
chemical and biological weapons. They both know, as well as we do,
and so can other countries, that such fabrications are baseless. But
does the knowledge of the truth constitute elements for interaction
in the politics of our day, which has witnessed the unleashing of the
American administration's evil to its fullest extent, dashing away
all hope in any good? Indeed, is there any good to be hoped for, or
expected, from the American administrations, now that they have been
transformed by their own greed, by Zionism as well as by other known
factors, into the tyrant of the age....</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council ... instead of leaving the American
administration and its lackey to reap the result of their evil, saved
wrongdoing rather than halted it ....</TE>
<TE>   We hereby inform you that we will deal with Resolution 1441,
despite its bad contents, if it is to be implemented according to the
premeditated evil of the parties of ill intent; the important thing
in this is trying to spare our people from any harm.... We are
prepared to receive the inspectors, so that they can carry out their
duties....</TE>
<TE>   We hope that you will, Mr. Secretary-General, advise the ignorants
not to push things to the precipice in the implementation, because
the people of Iraq will not choose to live at the price of their
dignity, country, freedom or sanctities, and they would rather make
their lives the price if that was the only way before them to
safeguard what they must safeguard.</TE>

<HD>Reports From a Tightrope</HD>
<DH>Palestinian journalist working for Israeli TV may have the
toughest job in news media as his allegiance is questioned by both
sides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>The boys were not armed, but there were a lot of them. They
surrounded Suleiman Shafhe and accused him of killing the militant
Islamic commander they had come to mourn and avenge.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just a journalist," Shafhe told the shoving youths.</LD>
<LD>   Shafhe is a Palestinian, and Arabic his native tongue. But he is a
reporter for Israeli television, and on the streets of Gaza, that's a
problem.</LD>
<TE>   Shafhe and his two-man camera crew steeled themselves and quickly
finished their report on Israel's use of a one-ton bomb to
assassinate a senior official of the radical Hamas organization. They
hurried from the scene, and their report led that evening's broadcast
of Israel's most popular nightly news program.</TE>
<TE>   Days are like that for Shafhe, who has one of the most difficult
jobs in journalism. Because he works for Israel's Channel Two and his
reports are in Hebrew for an Israeli audience, many Palestinians see
him as a traitor. But because he is an Arab, many Israeli viewers see
him as little more than a mouthpiece for the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "I get asked all the time, 'How can you do that job?' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shafhe, 37, is an Israeli citizen because his family decided to
stay in Israel after it became a nation in 1948, when many other
Arabs were forced to flee. That means he holds an Israeli passport
and can vote in Israel's elections.</TE>
<TE>   He is Palestinian by virtue of his ethnic and historic identity.</TE>
<TE>   His identities clash head-on, and his allegiances are forever
tugged and questioned. In a world that is increasingly black and
white, he represents gray, defying standard definitions and
straddling two societies at war. Every day, he crosses the front
lines, carrying news that some on either side don't want broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   It's akin to walking a tightrope and traversing a minefield at the
same time. Two years of devastating war have left little room for
nuance, and even journalists are cast in "with-us-or-against-us"
molds. Propaganda is often valued over truth, patriotism over
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Some Israeli viewers complain about his reports, saying they are
sick of seeing people on TV whom they consider to be terrorists.
Others worry about the dangers for someone representing an Israeli
entity who ventures into the lion's den. Shafhe has been attacked,
arrested or harassed by both the Israeli army and the Palestinian
police. Palestinian authorities were especially incensed when he
smuggled out of Gaza footage of a firing squad executing a
Palestinian man accused of collaborating with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Shafhe carves his constituency out of those Palestinians who
realize the benefits of getting their message across to an Israeli
audience, and those Israelis who want to find out more about the
neighbors they are fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Palestinians know a lot about Israelis, but Israelis don't know
enough about Palestinians," he said. "They need and want to know more
and more. Their sons are soldiers working in Gaza. They need to know
the atmosphere there."</TE>
<TE>   Channel Two also reaches most homes in the Gaza Strip, and is the
main source of information there about Israelis and Israeli politics.
Its daily broadcasts of the soap opera "The Bold and the Beautiful"
also bring in thousands of viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Shafhe gives a platform to Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual
founder of Hamas, and he shows impoverished Palestinian families
whose homes have been flattened by the Israeli military. But he also
shows masked Palestinian militiamen planning to attack Israelis, and
young Palestinian children at summer camps learning to make bombs.</TE>
<TE>   "Gaza is one big factory of news," Shafhe said. "Every street,
every corner, every family -- there are lots of stories."</TE>
<TE>   Shafhe figures that by showing Israelis the lives, tribulations
and successes of Palestinians, he can help Israelis understand why
they fight and resist.</TE>
<TE>   "Israelis need to hear the story," he said. "Israel has occupied
the Palestinians for nearly 40 years, but they only know them as
workers .... They don't try to know their lives, their traditions,
their plans for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "For Palestinians, it's a different question. Palestinians need
the press, especially the Israeli press. Maybe they want to influence
me, use me as a journalist."</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear what impact this window into Gaza has on ordinary
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Rogel Alpher, TV and media critic for the influential Haaretz
newspaper, said Channel Two news programming is generally tepid and
uncritical because, as a commercial network, it cannot afford to
offend too many people.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Alpher says, Shafhe tends to be exceedingly careful
and lacking an edge. Shafhe, and his numerous admirers, counter that
he's careful, yes, but professional, and that he strives for balance.</TE>
<TE>   Any impact Shafhe might have on Israeli Jews is undercut, Alpher
says, by the fact that he is an Arab. News of Palestinian suffering
or an Israeli atrocity is easily dismissed when it comes from an
Arab, he argues.</TE>
<TE>   But on the streets of his beat, Shafhe is a star.</TE>
<TE>   Taxi drivers on the border smile broadly when they see him; as he
moves about, it's handshakes all around, whether he's dealing with
Israeli soldiers at one side of the Erez checkpoint into Gaza or
Palestinian police at the other end of the barbed-wire, sandbagged
crossing. With people like this, Shafhe is the consummate schmoozer,
and he clearly enjoys the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   And it takes courage to do a report -- in Hebrew -- in downtown
Gaza City or in the seething Jabaliya refugee camp. Unlike some
reporters, he shuns the protection -- or control -- of police and
other authorities. Sometimes, though, he removes from his microphone
the Channel Two logo, especially while covering the funerals of young
Gazan men.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Abed Katib, a 30-year-old news photographer based in Gaza who
worked with Shafhe during the first Palestinian uprising in the late
1980s and early '90s, was asked about his old friend's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinians like him because he's a Palestinian," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then why do Israelis like him? "Because he's Israeli."</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual to see Shafhe with a cellular phone to each ear,
barking orders in Hebrew into one, in Arabic into the other.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in Rahat, a town of 40,000 Israeli Arabs in the Negev
desert just north of Beersheba. Its low-slung buildings are sprinkled
between two dry riverbeds, with the minarets of five mosques reaching
into a sky so bright it seems whitewashed. Rahat is home to the
Bedouin Heritage Museum.</TE>
<TE>   His father and his grandfather were farmers from a village
destroyed by Israel near what is now the Israeli city of Petah Tikva,
almost 60 miles to the north. Much of the family scattered after
1948, some landing in Jordan or in West Bank refugee camps. Shafhe's
parents settled in Rahat, where the family owned land. He was born
two years before Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Today, his brother lives next door, his parents down the street.
Shafhe lives with his wife Suad, also 37, and their four daughters
and two sons, ages 7 to 17. They built their comfortable, two-story
home 10 years ago on a plot with olive and pomegranate trees. An
arbor laden with overripe grapes shades the side porch against a
backdrop of bleating sheep.</TE>
<TE>   "As an Arab, in Israel, there are a lot of jobs you just can't
get," he said. "I hope, after the conflict is resolved, my kids will
have a future where I can say to my sons that they have opportunities
equal to Jewish kids. We deserve that."</TE>
<TE>   Suad, who covers her hair in traditional style, hails from the
West Bank city of Nablus. Because of restrictions imposed by the
Israeli army, she has not seen her parents or siblings for more than
a year.</TE>
<TE>   Her more immediate concern is her husband's safety. Every day when
he sets out on the 20-minute drive to Gaza, her chest tightens. She
frequently begs him to find another line of work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised when he comes back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few times he almost didn't. Early in the 25-month-old
conflict, the Israeli army arrested him every time he attempted to
leave the Gaza Strip. Demonstrations and gun battles were raging
almost daily. With Israeli citizenship, Shafhe was not supposed to go
to Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he knew he was in trouble with the Palestinian
Authority after he obtained, from a masked, secret source, a tape of
the execution of an accused collaborator. Palestinian officials did
not want to show the world an example of such brutal, summary
justice. Its appearance on Israeli TV, and then on networks
everywhere, infuriated the Palestinian Authority and, reportedly,
Yasser Arafat himself.</TE>
<TE>   Shafhe had a scoop, and death threats. He was warned to stay out
of Gaza, and he did. For a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm used to being in a place where death, blood and killing is
something normal," he said. "I know my family is suffering. But it's
my job. I like it. I need it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The late-morning sun had already turned the Erez crossing into a
furnace. Shafhe talked his way past the Israeli soldiers who declared
the Gaza checkpoint a "closed military zone," which means journalists
may not enter.</TE>
<TE>   Once beyond the first barrier, he obliged the next set of guards
with the required paperwork. Among journalists, Israelis, even the
Arab ones, have to sign a waiver when they go into the Gaza Strip,
absolving Israel of any responsibility for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   That done, he strode across the gray-tarmac no man's land to the
Palestinian checkpoint at the other end, again breezing through and
hooking up with his waiting camera crew. The day's story would be the
expulsion from the West Bank of two siblings of a man Israel had
declared a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   With dozens of other journalists, Shafhe spent the next several
hours awaiting the arrival of the expelled pair, Kifah Ajouri and his
sister Intisar.</TE>
<TE>   They never appeared. Israeli authorities sent a decoy vehicle to
the Erez Crossing and used a military convoy to slip the two into
Gazan territory by another route.</TE>
<TE>   When journalists at Erez caught wind of the ruse, they made a
high-speed dash through the chaotic streets of Gaza, dodging donkey
carts, children and rickety trucks, to reach the Ajouris.</TE>
<TE>   Shafhe was in the lead vehicle. "Slow, slow!" "Now, now!" he
shouted instructions at the adrenaline-powered driver.</TE>
<TE>   Shafhe was the first local journalist to find and catch up with
the prey. In seconds, he and his crew were on a sidewalk quizzing the
Ajouris in what would be the most complete interview they gave that
day.</TE>
<TE>   For all the anarchy, it was what passes here for success. Of
course, it doesn't always go that way.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling with a couple of Jewish Israeli reporters last year to
cover an Arab summit in Jordan, Shafhe was taken aside at Israel's
border and subjected to long interrogation by Israeli soldiers,
because he is an Arab.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, in the Jordanian capital of Amman, when Jordan's
authorities decided they didn't want Israeli press around, Shafhe was
expelled along with the Jewish reporters for being Israeli.</TE>
<TE>   "I live the two sides," Shafhe said. "That's my part of this
tragedy."</TE>

<HD>Student Resistance Persisting in Iran</HD>
<DH>Thousands mobilize for a fifth day of protests against
religious leaders. Movement spreads, but unlike with past calls for
reform, calm prevails.</DH>

<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Mounting a challenge to the Islamic Republic's religious leaders,
students have launched a campaign of peaceful civil disobedience on
university campuses across Iran, demanding the release of dissidents
and calling for an end to five years of political paralysis on
reform.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of students mobilized Wednesday for a fifth day of
sit-ins, this time on the tree-lined campus of Amir Kabir University
of Technology, the capital's leading technical institute, which is
often compared to MIT.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers said they intend to continue the demonstrations and
sit-ins until Students' Day on Dec. 5, which would make this the
longest sustained opposition protest since the country's 1979
revolution.</LD>
<TE>   The demonstrations in Tehran differ from protests in 1999 that led
to bloody confrontations and deaths when students tried to march off
campus. This time, students are calling for calm and have shifted the
sit-ins daily among campuses, with students from other universities
marching to join them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking for another revolution," said Yashar Ghajar, an
organizer from the Islamic Students Assn. and one of several
speakers. "We're looking for freedom of expression -- and freedom
after expression."</TE>
<TE>   The trigger for the protests was the death sentence handed down
last week against leading reformer and popular history professor
Hashem Aghajari for questioning the powers of Iran's hard-line
clergy, who ultimately control the country. The charges also included
blasphemy against the prophet Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   But the protests have quickly taken on a broader agenda and spread
to half a dozen cities, including Isfahan, Tabriz and Hamadan. Many
professors have not shown up for classes, indicating their support
for the students, analysts here say.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main goal is not just the Aghajari case. This is a protest
against the regime's behavior, especially on human rights, and the
closed political atmosphere throughout the country," said Roozbeh, a
21-year-old mechanical engineering student who asked that his surname
be withheld.</TE>
<TE>   "We've waited five years for change and little has happened," he
said of the 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, who pledged
major democratic reforms but has repeatedly been blocked by religious
conservatives who have veto power over the president and parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Khatami weighed in Wednesday on the verdict, saying it "never
should have been issued at all." He then called for the case to be
settled.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the current circumstances, no measures should be taken that
promote tension," he said after a Cabinet meeting, Iranian television
reported. Over the weekend, almost two-thirds of parliament, also
dominated by reformers, urged the judiciary to overturn the death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But students say they are now increasingly unhappy with Khatami
and other reformers, despite support for their political ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole student body is unhappy with Khatami, not because he's
not an honest man. But we need more than honesty. We need someone who
solves our problems," said a 21-year-old engineering major who
requested anonymity. Leaders of the 1999 protest are still in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Students' main target, however, is the bloc of hard-liners.
Protesters this week have shouted slogans aimed at them, including
"Death to the Taliban, in Kabul and Tehran," a reference to the rigid
religious movement that ruled in Afghanistan until the U.S. forced it
from power last year.</TE>
<TE>   Aghajari got into trouble for a June speech in Hamadan, the
historic center of Iran, for suggesting that Islam could be
interpreted or adapted according to the times and that
interpretations by earlier clerics were not necessarily sacred. He
was tried in a closed court without a jury and sentenced to be
hanged.</TE>
<TE>   Through his attorney, Aghajari said Wednesday that he would not
appeal the death sentence. That decision, analysts here said, could
force the government to back down or face even greater unrest.</TE>
<TE>   The student protest also defied a tough warning from the supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the ultimate veto in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "The day when the three branches of government are unable to
settle major problems, the supreme guide will, if he deems it
necessary, make popular force intervene," Khamenei warned, according
to the Islamic Republic News Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The popular forces are Iran's Revolutionary Guards; the Basij, or
volunteer Islamic militia; and other militant arms of the regime's
conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   But even the Basiji have questioned the Aghajari verdict. "This
sentence is so unconventional that it has raised a lot of questions,"
said their letter to Iran's judiciary, according to reports in Iran's
press and a copy posted on the Amir Kabir campus. The letter called
for the sentence to be revoked and the punishment reconsidered.</TE>
<TE>   Students were almost buoyant about their prospects, even though
police conspicuously surrounded the university.</TE>
<TE>   "Students are tired of this government and want to shout against
them. No one in history has been able to block the trend of freedom
and common sense," said Keivan Ansarai, a doctoral candidate in
chemical engineering.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, the protesters were like lions who roared about freedom,"
Ansarai said. "They were put in jail and tortured. Now, these
protesters are like canaries who sing about freedom and rights. They
may not be as tough as the lions, but they will be successful because
of their enormous numbers."</TE>

they're not supposed to. It's their 'connection with the outside

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Nearly every night, Murtadha Eqabi manages to escape from the control
that the Iraqi government tries to exert over everything the college
student hears and sees. He turns on a radio.</LD>
<LD>   Tuning in to foreign news broadcasts is a ritual Eqabi shares with
his father inside their small apartment here. They listen to the news
broadcast in Arabic by French-run Radio Monte Carlo, getting
information the regime tries to keep from them.</LD>
<LD>   "Despite the fact that there are severe sanctions on our country,
we do have connection with the outside world," said Eqabi, an
archeology student at Baghdad University. "I listen to the news. It
is part of our life."</LD>
<TE>   President Saddam Hussein remains determined to restrict what
Iraq's 22 million citizens know about the world beyond their borders.
His people are cut off by trade sanctions and censorship, both of
which limit access to technology, and they are force-fed government
news accounts that frequently differ greatly from what much of the
world hears. Satellite television is banned. Some foreign radio
broadcasts are jammed. All internal media are state-controlled.</TE>
<TE>   These days that kind of strict control is especially important for
Hussein's government as it works to maintain order in the face of a
possible U.S.-led attack. Anything that might chisel away at the
appearance of unity in Iraq makes the leadership nervous. A new U.S.
government program, Radio Sawa, which mixes Western and Arabic music
with short bursts of news and is highly popular among young people,
is one target of the regime's electronic scramblers.</TE>
<TE>   "What they fear most now is domestic unrest," said a European
diplomat based in Baghdad. "They need to feel and look unified. For
months they have been working on that."</TE>
<TE>   In trying to maintain that order, the government has realized that
it needs to balance its reflexive leaning toward censorship with a
rising public appetite to live in the modern world. To say the regime
is becoming soft would be an overstatement. But it is recognizing the
value of making people happy, or at least happier than they were. It
recently issued a broad amnesty freeing almost every prisoner from
jail. It has lifted taxes on travelers. It is making it easier for
dropouts to return to school.</TE>
<TE>   And it has given the people the Discovery Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi television now offers, for a fee and to a select group only,
new choices that include Discovery and a movie channel that serves up
Hollywood fare, including recent broadcasts of "The Hunt for Red
October" and "The Spanish Prisoner."</TE>
<TE>   The regime also has provided wider access to the Internet and
e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   It first permitted Internet access for government ministries two
years ago, but even top officials were not permitted to send e-mail
from their offices. They had to go to a special government office.</TE>
<TE>   Internet access to all mail-related Web sites, such as Hotmail and
Yahoo, is still blocked, but individuals can buy government-monitored
e-mail accounts to use at home. On the Internet, Iraqis can access
most Western media, but sites tied to groups opposing the government
are blocked.</TE>
<TE>   At a cost of about $75 for three months of Internet access, plus
additional fees for e-mail, both services are beyond the reach of
most Iraqis. Many rely instead on Internet cafes, where they can surf
the Web and send e-mail for the equivalent of about 50 cents an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Ida Mustafa is the director of the first Internet center at
Baghdad University. Her job is to collect fees (25 cents an hour for
students), offer advice on how to use the Internet and make sure no
one is finding his or her way to banned sites. Even before the
students sit down, they must register their intent to use the
Internet with their college and list several keywords they plan to
search out.</TE>
<TE>   "You are free to search whatever you like," Mustafa said, adding:
"We have monitoring. Later I check for forbidden sites."</TE>
<TE>   Mustafa's center is in the library on the campus outside downtown
Baghdad. The room is small, with just eight terminals, and very
quiet. The center has become so popular that students are restricted
to two hours of access a week. There is no sense of playfulness here.
Students recently were researching school topics, such as "inertia
rockets" and "radiation detection." Ask them about the Internet and
they offer a touch of defiance.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a way around sanctions," said Ebtisam Fadel, 31, a
postgraduate student who was researching "video image compression."</TE>
<TE>   Many Iraqis may have First World expectations, a hangover from
what is seen as the nation's modern golden age -- before the 1980-88
war with Iran and Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait -- when the ruling
Arab Baath Socialist Party poured money into education and
infrastructure. But the 1970s are long gone, and Iraq is in Third
World shape due in part to international sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, that means the only escape comes in the form of
scratchy radio waves.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that everyone is listening. Yadulah Nouri Ali, 61, lives
with 10 relatives in a crumbling apartment block and can barely come
up with the $5 a day they need to survive. He has listened to BBC,
Radio Monte Carlo and, he admits, Voice of America.</TE>
<TE>   Shukur Jassim, 52, works for the Ministry of Information and sells
books in an open-air market to make some extra cash. "Every night
before I go to sleep I listen to VOA, BBC and Monte Carlo," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Baghdad University, where students study liberal arts, everyone
who was asked described an avid interest in radio broadcasts from
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Vian Amjad, 23, who is majoring in German-language studies, tunes
in daily at midnight to listen to Radio Monte Carlo with her mother,
brother, uncle and grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "We are listening mainly to hear about political problems," she
said. With so many people listening to contradictory news reports --
as Baghdad says one thing and the West another -- a logical question
is, which side do people believe?</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad, where criticizing the government can lead to prison
time, that question elicits either a predictable endorsement of the
regime or feigned confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Monte Carlo "is the same as Baghdad radio," Amjad said
before she and her cousin giggled and looked away. "Why?"</TE>

<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>On a cold winter night nearly a year ago, the spiritual leader of the
Taliban took one of two open roads leading out of this city, his
movement's last stronghold, and vanished into the desolate mountains
of central Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   There were U.S. warplanes in the air, a Marine base nearby and
Afghan allies on the ground. But Mullah Mohammed Omar had an
advantage: He knew the moonscape terrain from childhood.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, about 300 miles to the northeast, U.S. forces searching
for Osama bin Laden along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border heard the
last confirmed transmission from him. In the months since then, a
series of massive military operations by U.S. forces has found no
trace of either man. And each unsuccessful foray has increased the
fugitives' stature with their followers.</LD>
<TE>   The disappearance of the two most wanted men in Afghanistan is a
potent reminder of the difficulty of hunting down enemy leaders. The
apparent reemergence of Bin Laden in a taped message this week looms
large as the United States prepares to go after one more "most
wanted" figure: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. experts have concluded that the voice on the tape urging new
attacks on the United States and praising recent acts of terrorism
elsewhere in the world is almost certainly that of Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say the United States errs when it focuses on
individuals, who are vastly more elusive than the bridges, airfields
and other fixed assets of a regime.</TE>
<TE>   Such figures can serve as a rallying point for protests, or an
inspiration for further terrorist attacks. Every mission to capture
them runs the risk of causing civilian casualties, which increase
resentment of U.S. power.</TE>
<TE>   "We put ourselves into a trap by demonizing these people and
insisting on total victory, and we often don't have the strategic
means to get them," said Donald Abenheim, an expert in military
strategy and history at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. "It
makes the individual the center of gravity, and we feed [a desire] to
create an uprising against the West -- and that remains the greatest
threat to security."</TE>
<TE>   The pattern was apparent shortly after the Sept. 11 terror
attacks, when President Bush declared he wanted Bin Laden "dead or
alive."</TE>
<TE>   Such pronouncements fit into a long history that includes Gen.
John Pershing's futile pursuit of Pancho Villa in the rugged
mountains of northern Mexico, a missile attack on Libyan dictator
Moammar Kadafi in the 1980s and the capture of Panamanian dictator
Manuel Noriega in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. and other international forces
periodically raid villages, looking for war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic. The former Bosnian Serb leader, like Omar, is thought to be
hiding in the mountains that were his childhood home.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, Omar's knowledge of the landscape clearly helped
him escape during a chaotic 24-hour period between Dec. 6 and 7, when
the Taliban agreed to surrender Kandahar, its last stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Four roads lead out of Kandahar, only two of which were blocked by
Afghan forces allied with the United States. On the city's outskirts,
signs of habitation vanish quickly into a landscape of flat plains
and barren hillsides that is at once deceptively simple and an utter
mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Either of the two roads open to Omar that night led into friendly
terrain -- areas he knew well enough to avoid confrontations with
forces loyal to Hamid Karzai, who was fighting there at the time and
has since become Afghanistan's president.</TE>
<TE>   One route traversed Zabol province, home to semi-nomadic herders,
many of whom had backed the Taliban. The other led to Helmand
province. Many Taliban leaders, including Omar, had homes and allies
in Helmand and adjacent valleys in Oruzgan province.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials acknowledge that the two factions friendly to the
Americans closing in on Kandahar that night were unaware of each
other's activities. Neither one moved to block the roads.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not very good coordination between the two Afghan
groups," recalled Engineer Yusuf Pashtun, a top aide to local warlord
Gul Agha Shirzai.</TE>
<TE>   Deeper into the desert plains, anti-Taliban warlords lacked
telephones or other means of communication and were barely even in
touch with forces allied with the U.S. They learned of Omar's
impending surrender from radio broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of Weapons</TE>
<TE>   Along the road to Helmand, commander Malim Khad Mazer in the
village of Gereshk mustered all the men he could. He says there were
about 1,000 of them, but only about 150 had weapons. They seized the
police station and stopped there. For the rest of the night they lay
low.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had been armed and had food and money and satellite phones,
then we could have arrested each and every Taliban, including their
leaders," Mazer said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Salman Shah's men were braver -- but even more poorly
armed. Warned by a messenger that the Taliban was escaping, Shah
gathered 20 men. Only five had guns. They picked a point on a main
track with a high wall on one side, so approaching vehicles would not
be able to see how few men and guns confronted them.</TE>
<TE>   After the first Taliban trucks halted, vehicles toward the rear
turned around. A mile back down the road was a river ferry; on the
other side were the trackless mountains that could best conceal those
fleeing.  Residents told Shah later that they heard as many as 20
vehicles crossing the river that night.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban were from here so they knew how to operate the boats
themselves," Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not known whether Omar and other Taliban leaders crossed the
river that night or took another route. There are similar stories
about the disappearance of Bin Laden along the Afghanistan-Pakistan
border, where mountains rise like giant teeth and experience is
required to endure biting cold and pick a path through rocks, roots
and thorn bushes.</TE>
<TE>   Warlords Not Trusted</TE>
<TE>   While local commanders complained that the U.S. was relying too
much on air power to pound the deep caves at Tora Bora where Bin
Laden was believed to be hiding in early December last year, there
were doubts about some of the Afghans' commitment as well.</TE>
<TE>   One warlord, Haji Mohammed Zaman, was accused by other Afghans of
negotiating a break in the bombing so that he could negotiate with Al
Qaeda, only to use the respite to help Arab fighters, presumably
after the payment of healthy bribes, escape into the lawless
Pakistani tribal areas. According to Western officials, another
warlord, Hazrat Ali, also allowed his troops to escort Al Qaeda
figures into Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases the warlords or the commanders who worked under them
had known the Al Qaeda figures for years. In tribal landscapes,
personal history -- and often money -- counts more than geopolitics.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden disappeared so completely that up until this week, many
top U.S. officials had said they thought he was dead. Others believe
he is operating in the wild tribal lands of Pakistan near the Afghan
frontier.</TE>
<TE>   It could be equally difficult to track down Hussein if he survives
a U.S. attack -- a prospect many military planners and analysts
regard as unlikely -- and heads home to the Tikrit region of central
Iraq. The United States lacks even the basic local assets there that
it had in central Afghanistan, where its ally Karzai at least had a
loose network of connections and allegiances.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein has institutions around him, guards, intelligence
officers, all of whom are Tikritis, clans with blood loyalties to
him.... From an intelligence perspective, those kinds of bonds are
almost impossible to infiltrate," said Timothy Lomperis, chairman of
the political science department at St. Louis University and a former
Army intelligence officer.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops would be faced with the prospect of searching villages
for Hussein, a prospect that increases the risk of civilian
casualties. Their experience of Afghanistan illustrates that killing
or wounding civilians has an impact far beyond the villages where the
incidents occur.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military's standing in southern Afghanistan, already
damaged by inadvertent attacks on Afghan allies, sank further last
summer when U.S. soldiers searching for Omar in Oruzgan province
mistakenly killed dozens of people, the majority of whom were women
and children attending a wedding party.</TE>
<TE>   Local Afghan leaders, whose support is crucial to the effort to
capture remnants of the Taliban, were openly critical. Officials in
Kabul, the capital, who usually support the Americans, demanded
changes in the U.S. military's operating procedures. Further
complicating the hunt, unidentified gunmen, who could either be
relatives of those who died in the attacks or former Taliban, have
repeatedly fired on U.S. soldiers in the area.</TE>
<TE>   As they face the prospect of tracking down Hussein, U.S. officials
now face a renewed challenge from Bin Laden. And intelligence sources
say they believe that Omar remains hidden in the mountain redoubts
near his birthplace, suggesting the difficulty of the task ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think they [U.S. forces] will get Mullah Omar," said a
senior diplomat in Kabul who has traveled extensively in the Afghan
heartland for 20 years. "For the people where he is hiding, he is
from there, he is of them. He acted as they think he should act."</TE>

<HD>Army Drives Deep Into Gaza City</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops and armor pushed into Gaza City before dawn today in
the deepest such incursion into the heart of the crowded seaside
metropolis since the outbreak of fighting more than two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The troops, firing machine guns and backed by circling
helicopters, came close to the home of Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, Palestinian witnesses and officials reported. The slum
neighborhood, called Sabra, is home to many other top Hamas leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians said two people were hurt in the two-hour operation.
The army did not report any casualties. An officer in the Palestinian
preventive security service and three of his brothers were arrested,
their family said.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli troops have been carrying out intensive house-to-house
searches for suspected militants in the northern West Bank cities of
Nablus and Tulkarm, but operations of this scale and nature have been
rare in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Airstrikes have been much more common; army helicopters on the
previous two nights rocketed industrial workshops that Israel said
were being used to manufacture weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The move into Gaza City came just hours after a 2-year-old
Palestinian boy died of gunshot wounds in the southern Gaza Strip
near the border with Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   His father said the boy was killed by unprovoked Israeli gunfire,
but the army said its troops fired only after coming under attack.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Wednesday, the Israeli Cabinet engaged in renewed, sharp
debate over the question of expelling Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   At a Wednesday night meeting, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and
Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, both new to their posts, again
urged sending Arafat into exile. But Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who
has promised the U.S. that he will not harm Arafat, resisted.</TE>

<HD>Bush Wants to Halt Oil Shipments to N. Korea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush wants to halt oil shipments to North Korea in the wake
of that country's admission that it has pursued a secret nuclear
weapons program, administration officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The policy, which U.S. diplomats hope will be backed by Japan,
South Korea and the European Union, would allow delivery of a
shipment now on its way to North Korea. But that would be the last
unless Pyongyang gives up the program, the officials said on the
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   The shipments are part of an energy assistance plan approved for
North Korea in 1994 to steer it away from nuclear weapons.</LD>
<TE>   The fate of the shipments will be discussed today by the board of
the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, composed of the
United States, Japan, South Korea and the EU.</TE>

<HD>Release of Bin Laden Tape Is Seen as Part of a Careful
Comeback Strategy</HD>
<DH>Timing and form may aim at boosting impact of message and
lessening his exposure, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After melting into the mountains of Afghanistan more than a year ago,
Osama bin Laden made a careful and calculated comeback by resurfacing
this week, U.S. intelligence officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials said intelligence analysts are convinced the voice
on the 4 1/2-minute tape played on the Qatar-based Al Jazeera
television network Tuesday is Bin Laden's. And the manner in which
the recording was released appears to have been calibrated to
maximize the impact of the terror mastermind's message -- to
followers and foes alike -- and minimize his exposure to those
hunting him.</LD>
<LD>   The appearance of the tape was well timed, experts said, coming at
a moment when a possible war between the United States and Iraq is
roiling the Arab world and fueling sympathy for a figure who dares to
taunt the West.</LD>
<TE>   The thrust of the message was familiar, but this time the Al Qaeda
leader aimed his chilling threats not only at the U.S. but more
directly at its allies, including Australia and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   And having shown a prior fondness for appearing on camera, this
time Bin Laden offered only a disembodied voice, making the
communication more difficult to trace -- and leaving scant clues
about his whereabouts, health or appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he does a costs-benefit analysis: the risk of exposure
versus the risk of [being assumed] dead," said Danielle Pletka, a
Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute. "For him,
this is a game of politics and he balances the need for discretion in
his appearances with the need to rally his base."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence continued to examine the recording, saying that
Bin Laden voice experts are firmly convinced it is his voice on the
tape but that technical analysis has been inconclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Computerized analysis has been hampered by the poor quality of the
recording, a U.S. official said. The message appears to have been
recorded many times as it traveled from Bin Laden's hide-out to Al
Jazeera's studios, and at one point was transmitted by phone.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush declined to say whether he believes that Bin Laden
made the tape but said the recording is being treated as a serious
threat.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever put this tape out has put the world on notice yet again
that we're at war," Bush said. "It should remind all of America, and
remind our friends and allies, that there is an active enemy that
continues to hate, is willing to use murder as a way to achieve their
goals."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Bin Laden's reappearance points to failures by U.S.
forces in Afghanistan last year, Bush bristled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making great progress in the war on terror," he said. "I
warned the American people that this is going to take time.... We're
on a manhunt and we're not quitting. Slowly but surely, we're
achieving our objective."</TE>
<TE>   The tape provided the first reliable piece of evidence in nearly a
year that Bin Laden is alive, because he praised last month's attacks
in Indonesia, Russia, Kuwait and Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden made no mention, however, of more recent events that
would ordinarily earn his condemnation, including Syria's vote in the
United Nations last week in support of new weapons inspections in
Iraq, or a CIA missile strike that killed a carful of Al Qaeda
operatives in Yemen. For that reason, U.S. officials said the tape
was probably made in late October or early November.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities were said to be working with officials in Qatar
to retrace the path by which the tape was delivered to the offices of
Al Jazeera. But experts said clues are likely to be scarce.</TE>
<TE>   "They did this tape and transmitted it in a way that you can't
follow the crumbs," said Vince Cannistraro, a former
counter-terrorism official at the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Absent any signs of life from the Al Qaeda leader, some top U.S.
officials had concluded that Bin Laden was dead. Experts said one
reason he resurfaced is that many followers were undoubtedly reaching
the same conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   A former CIA official with extensive experience in the Arab world
said many experts think that Al Qaeda has devolved into more
autonomous, loosely connected cells over the past year and that Bin
Laden may have felt the need to reassert himself.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing has metastasized away from him," said the former
CIA officer, who requested anonymity. "He's trying to get back in the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Many experts said Bin Laden appears to have waited as
anti-American sentiment in the Middle East and elsewhere grew, fueled
by resentment of U.S. support for Israel and intensified recently by
the escalation of Washington's pressure on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden has not been seen as devoted to the Palestinian cause,
or shown any fondness for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But his
taped message focused on these issues as part of what experts say is
a shrewd attempt to expand Al Qaeda's support.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a high level of humiliation in the Arab world related to
Palestine and Iraq," said Shibley Telhami, a Middle East expert at
the Brookings Institution. "These are not Bin Laden's issues, but he
comes to cash in on this."</TE>
<TE>   Among Arabs frustrated with their own governments' inability to
stand up to the West, Telhami said, Bin Laden represents "a vote for
defiance."</TE>
<TE>   Others said that Bin Laden, who has cast himself as the defender
of Islam, may have decided that he couldn't afford to remain silent
amid such turmoil in the Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's not going to take the stage now, when is he?" said Bruce
Hoffman, director of the Washington office of the Rand Corp. think
tank. "If he's going to be silent now, he loses credibility as the
true defender of Islam. If he doesn't speak out now, who will listen
to him again?"</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden may have made the tape only after other, more cautious
attempts at communicating with supporters in recent weeks had little
impact.</TE>
<TE>   A typed letter faxed to Al Jazeera last month supposedly bearing
Bin Laden's signature was dismissed by intelligence officials and
virtually ignored by much of the media.</TE>
<TE>   Experts expressed doubt that Bin Laden had used the taped message
released Tuesday to relay coded operational instructions to Al Qaeda
cells. "This would be a terribly cumbersome way to do that," another
former CIA officer said.</TE>
<TE>   For Bin Laden, there are obvious advantages to making only an
audiotape. Video recordings require more equipment, more assistance
and might provide inadvertent clues about a subject's surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials said there could be other reasons for
Bin Laden to be camera-shy.</TE>
<TE>   "He might not want people to see his current physical appearance,
either because he doesn't look very good or because it has changed in
some respects," a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden has been reported to suffer from a kidney ailment.</TE>

<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The commander of Indonesia's elite commando force will be charged
with gross human rights violations for his alleged involvement in the
massacre of 33 protesters in 1984, the nation's attorney general said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of Muslim youths were fired on by soldiers while
demonstrating peacefully in northern Jakarta, the capital, against
the arrest of several anti-government protesters.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Mohammed Abdul Rahman said Maj. Gen. Sriyanto, who
heads the army's Kopassus special forces unit, was in charge of army
operations in the region at the time of the killings.</LD>
<TE>   Rahman told a parliamentary commission that Sriyanto would be
charged along with 13 others, including two retired generals, early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from the military, and it was not
possible to contact Sriyanto, who, like many Indonesians, uses only
one name.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the National Human Rights Commission recommended that 23
suspects, including Sriyanto, be tried for the killings. After years
of debate about the death toll, the commission found that 33 people
were killed. The military had put the number at 18, and victims'
relatives said it was in the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Kopassus members have been linked over the years to numerous human
rights abuses. Earlier this year, several members were named as
suspects in the killing of Papuan independence leader Theys Eluay in
2001.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Iraq Accepts U.N. Terms for Inspections</HD>
<DH>Baghdad says it will unconditionally receive monitors to
prove it has no forbidden weapons. Its action does not preclude a
war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Two days before the deadline to respond, Iraq accepted a tough new
U.N. resolution Wednesday that will return weapons inspectors to the
country after a nearly four-year absence.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq's U.N. ambassador said his country hadn't placed any
conditions on the resolution's terms but that Baghdad considers parts
of the document "unfair" and "illegal."</LD>
<LD>   In a rambling, sometimes bombastic nine-page acceptance letter to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri
called the Security Council a "gang of evil" and accused the U.S. of
"the most wicked slander against Iraq." But it also said Baghdad
would receive U.N. inspectors in order to prove that Iraq has no
weapons of mass destruction and to spare its people from war.</LD>
<TE>   But Wednesday's acceptance by no means precludes a war. A more
significant deadline comes Dec. 8, when Iraq must declare any
materiel that can be used for chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Because Iraqi officials reiterated Wednesday that Iraq is "clean"
of weapons of mass destruction, if they later declare that they have
weapons after all, President Saddam Hussein will be shown to have
been lying. And if the Iraqis declare again that they don't have
weapons, they will be suspected of lying.</TE>
<TE>   After delivering the letter to Annan's office Wednesday, Iraqi
Ambassador to the U.N. Mohammed Douri said: "The letter says that
Iraq will deal with Security Council Resolution 1441, despite its bad
contents. There are no conditions, no reservations."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. officials said that despite its frothy
language, the bottom line of the letter was "yes," the answer they
were waiting to hear. President Bush said he wouldn't tolerate
"deception or denial or deceit" from Hussein, and he once again
warned that if Iraq "chooses not to disarm, we will have a coalition
of the willing with us" to rid Iraq of any forbidden weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Bush met Wednesday afternoon with Annan, who advised him to be
patient and to give the process time to play out. At the same time,
the United Nations chief praised Bush both for taking the issue to
the world body and for using military threats to compel Iraq to
comply.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure has already yielded some results," Annan said, "and
that has to be maintained."</TE>
<TE>   The secretary-general pointed out that U.N. resolutions are
automatically binding, so Iraq has no option on complying with the
measure. But 1441, passed unanimously Friday to force Iraq to disarm
or face "severe consequences," included the one-week deadline on
responding to the resolution as an early benchmark to measure
Baghdad's cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure they have any other choice. To reject it would imply
a decision that they want war right away," Annan said. "I don't think
[Hussein] is that suicidal."</TE>
<TE>   After Iraq makes its materiel declaration, it will be up to the
weapons inspectors to determine the next steps.</TE>
<TE>   Chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix has considered the possibility that
Baghdad will declare that it has no weapons. "The absence of evidence
is not the evidence of absence," Blix said in a recent interview with
The Times. "But it is also not the evidence of presence. We are asked
to verify on the ground what we see with our own eyes."</TE>
<TE>   An advance team of weapons inspectors from the U.N. and the
International Atomic Energy Agency will arrive in Iraq on Monday to
begin logistical preparations. Full-fledged inspections using
high-tech equipment, such as planes using ground-penetrating radar
and radiation detection, will begin on or before Dec. 23.</TE>
<TE>   If the inspectors discover something showing that Iraq has
continued to pursue forbidden weapons programs, or if they are
significantly hampered in their work, they can report to the Security
Council, which will then debate the consequences. The U.S. has
consented to consulting with the council but insists it will not have
to wait for another resolution to use military force.</TE>
<TE>   If Iraq continues to cooperate, the inspectors will make their
first report to the council Feb. 21 and every 60 days thereafter --
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington doesn't expect it to take that long. "We're not
going to wait until February to see whether Iraq is cooperating or
not," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said this week on CNN's
"Late Edition."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has a history of saying, "yes, but" to the United Nations.
Two months ago, when Baghdad invited inspectors back four days after
Bush warned in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly that Iraq was a
"threat to peace," it later claimed that Hussein's eight presidential
compounds should be exempt.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's missive agrees to cooperate with inspectors, although
it harshly criticizes the resolution and the Security Council, and
promises a follow-up letter enumerating the parts of the resolution
that Iraq believes are contrary to international law.</TE>
<TE>   The letter appears to issue a warning to the inspection team,
saying, "Dealing with the inspectors, the government of Iraq will
also take into consideration their way of conduct [and] the
intentions of those who are ill-intentioned among them."</TE>
<TE>   And it asks that the U.N. team bear in mind that Iraq is observing
the holy month of Ramadan and that the inspectors "show respect to
the people's national dignity, their independence and security."</TE>
<TE>   The missive portrays Iraq as a victim of U.S. and British
manipulation and bullying of the Security Council, and it calls
British Prime Minister Tony Blair a "lackey" of Bush. It goes on to
assert that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction and that
inspectors will determine "that Iraq is void of those alleged
weapons, or [that] the whole thing was nothing but an evil cover by
those who were behind the resolution who have no scruples."</TE>
<TE>   A senior State Department official said the letter's tone made it
more difficult to discern whether the Iraqis really meant to say yes.
"Anyone who has dealt with the Iraqis has to take an attitude of some
skepticism," the official said, noting that the letter was "wrapped
in nine pages of diatribe."</TE>
<TE>   "But on the other hand, we have outlined a course where we can
resolve this peacefully, and we're intent on making that course
work," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Even Annan, the soft-spoken U.N. chief who has tried to delicately
mediate behind the scenes, appeared a bit skeptical of Iraq's claims.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep saying they don't have weapons of mass destruction,
which nobody believes," Annan said Wednesday in Washington. "If you
have no weapons of mass destruction, why have you kept the inspectors
out for four years?"</TE>

<HD>Output of Crude Oil Gushes</HD>
<DH>A step-up in production by OPEC could reduce the economic
shock of a military strike on Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saudi Arabia and other OPEC oil producers are flooding world markets
with crude oil, a shift that experts say should help offset any
economic dislocation from a military strike against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The surge of production has helped wash away a $5-a-barrel "war
premium" that pushed the price of crude above $30 in early October,
industry experts say, and may have reduced the risk of spot shortages
during the initial stages of a U.S.-led military offensive. If
sustained, it also could boost the economies of the United States and
other consuming countries.</LD>
<LD>   "OPEC has increased production dramatically in the last 30 to 45
days, which is why we're seeing the price fall," said Larry
Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in
New York.</LD>
<TE>   The 11 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries have had little to say on the production boom. But some
experts believe it reflects a deliberate strategy by key OPEC
producers to stockpile crude closer to end markets in the United
States, Europe and Asia, where it would be less vulnerable if war
breaks out, and to prevent prices from rising to dangerously high
levels.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the potential for Iraq being taken offline very quickly,
you have the potential for the winter being severe, and you have the
question of whether we're coming out of a worldwide recession or
sinking into one," said Ed Porter, research manager at the American
Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group. "OPEC doesn't want to
trigger something it didn't intend."</TE>
<TE>   Some oil analysts see less charitable motives at work. They cite
evidence of an escalating battle for market share between the Saudis
and other OPEC members, who are exceeding their official production
quotas as never before. The competition has been exacerbated by Iraqi
production hikes linked to President Saddam Hussein's efforts to
placate his critics and preserve his regime.</TE>
<TE>   "The Saudis are focused on the long-term market for their oil,"
said Newport Beach energy economist Philip K. Verleger. "They don't
want to let anybody else capture it. If other countries increase and
cheat, they'll increase and cheat. They're not philanthropic."</TE>
<TE>   But whatever the motive, the effect of sharply higher oil
production is to ease a major economic concern: that war in the
Middle East would spark fears of shortages, driving crude prices
sharply higher and damaging already shaky industrial economies.</TE>
<TE>   The benchmark price of U.S. light sweet crude, responding to
Iraq's promise of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, fell 71
cents further Wednesday to $25.19 for a 42-gallon barrel, well below
its October high of $30.83.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say a sustained $5-a-barrel decline in oil prices could
boost U.S. economic growth by 0.2%.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the drop in crude prices has not shown up at the gasoline
pump. The prices of refined products respond to their own market
dynamics, and rising demand, low gasoline inventories and reduced
refinery output have combined to boost gasoline prices even as prices
for crude have declined.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC's rising output has improved the fortunes of oil transport
companies. Tanker operators say increased demand for their services
has allowed them to double the rates they charge for moving crude
from terminals in the Middle East to deepwater ports in the Gulf of
Mexico and other destinations.</TE>
<TE>   In September, all OPEC members except Iraq agreed to individual
quotas that would limit their combined production to 21.7 million
barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   But the International Energy Agency in Paris reported Tuesday that
actual "OPEC 10" output rose to 24.2 million barrels a day in
October, setting a record for overproduction. The biggest quota
buster was Saudi Arabia, which traditionally has exercised more
restraint than other OPEC members.</TE>
<TE>   The agency calculated daily world production of oil in October at
78.3 million barrels.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation said
industry sources have told him that OPEC 10 production has continued
its rapid rise this month and may be running as much as 3.5 million
barrels a day above the official limit.</TE>
<TE>   The extra oil has not yet made its way into refinery tanks in the
U.S. and other consuming countries. Analysts say much of it remains
in OPEC storage facilities or aboard giant tankers that take more
than a month to cross the Atlantic. In addition, refiners may be
drawing down their stocks and delaying purchases because they believe
prices will continue to drop.</TE>
<TE>   "The indicators suggest there's a tremendous amount of oil on the
water looking for a home," Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's oil industry has been subject to U.N. restrictions since
the end of the Gulf War in 1991, so it has been exempt from the OPEC
quota-setting process.</TE>
<TE>   But Iraq's production has been increasing too, reaching 2.5
million barrels a day in October. Iraq's output received a big boost
in September when Hussein stopped demanding illegal kickbacks from
buyers, a move that may have been designed to improve his standing
among consuming nations.</TE>
<TE>   Discerning the motives behind OPEC's increasing output involves
considerable sleuthing and a fair amount of guesswork. The cartel and
its member governments rarely divulge production, storage and
transport details. Scores of economists, analysts and consultants try
to keep tabs on OPEC, but they rely in part on anecdotal evidence and
secondhand accounts.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, oil experts say it is difficult to know how much
of OPEC's recent production increases can be attributed to
expectations of war and how much to more mundane market forces.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Sieminski, global oil strategist with Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown in London, said the recent decline in oil prices was fueled by
Iraq's production increases, rampant cheating by the OPEC 10 and the
perception that the U.S. was softening its stance on Iraq before the
United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   The economic implications of OPEC's recent actions depend in part
on the cartel's internal cohesiveness, which is subject to
considerable dispute.</TE>
<TE>   If rising production reflects a carefully controlled effort to
minimize the shock of a military strike, prices are likely to remain
within OPEC's target range of $22 to $28 a barrel for Arab oil, which
generally trades about $2 below U.S. light sweet crude in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But if OPEC's aggressive quota busting leads to a production
free-for-all, oil prices could fall further, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a reasonable possibility we could repeat the
1985-86 price crash," said Verleger, the energy economist.</TE>

<HD>Atkinson Admired for Diplomatic Skills, Consensus-Building</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a moment last year that highlighted the national debate over
affirmative action, Richard C. Atkinson demonstrated one of his
finest skills: As a cognitive psychologist, he knows how to find the
middle ground between opposing human forces.</LD>
<LD>   Atkinson, who will step down as president of the University of
California system next year, crafted a compromise while being
pressured by state lawmakers at a tense regents meeting in May 2001.
The legislators wanted UC to rescind its ban on affirmative action.</LD>
<LD>   The move would be largely symbolic -- even with the action,
Proposition 209 still would bar affirmative action at UC and other
state agencies. All the same, some regents resented the intrusion of
legislators.</LD>
<TE>   So Atkinson shuttled between the regents and the lawmakers in a
nearby room, finally negotiating a deal that enabled both sides to
put their qualms with the ban on the record.</TE>
<TE>   "He was doing diplomacy between the parties as we came up with the
final language. Twenty-four hours before the meeting, I don't think
anyone thought this would come about," marveled Paul Mitchell, former
chief consultant to the Assembly Higher Education Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Observers say Atkinson, 73, has been a master of
consensus-building.</TE>
<TE>   "He led the university through the period following the passage of
Proposition 209 quite deftly, trying to balance concerns about the
use of race in admissions and financial aid decisions against the
need to keep some semblance of diversity on campuses," said Thomas J.
Kane, a UCLA expert on higher education.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Atkinson knew when he could throw his weight
around. That was demonstrated by his threat to scrap the SAT test in
UC admissions, which sent the exam's owner scurrying to put more
emphasis on what students learn in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson earned a degree from the University of Chicago at the age
of 19 and then a doctorate from Indiana University. As a professor,
mainly at Stanford, he developed one of the first computer-assisted
learning programs for schoolchildren. Atkinson eventually was so
respected for his research on memory and cognition that he was one of
the rare psychologists elected to the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson also co-founded Computer Curriculum Corp., earning him a
fortune when it was bought out by a bigger company, and co-wrote a
best-selling psychology textbook with his psychologist wife, Rita.
Their daughter, Lynn, is a neurosurgeon in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   He also spent five years as assistant director and then director
of the National Science Foundation until he became chancellor of UC
San Diego in 1980, where he stayed until being named UC's president
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he endured a personal crisis. He was sued by a former
assistant professor of education at Harvard University who claimed
that he impregnated her in 1977 and persuaded her to have an
abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson consistently denied the allegations, but in February
1986, he agreed to pay Lee Perry $250,000 to settle her claims. He
said at the time that the settlement was not an admission of
liability, but that he and his wife wanted to bring the matter to a
close and avoid further legal proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The incident did not stop his career. Along the way, he won praise
for his fund-raising and a gentle style that deflected animosities,
traits that he carried on to the system presidency.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference when he became UC system chief, Atkinson made
a rare personal reference. He said he was a first-generation
American, the son of a French mother -- who immigrated to the United
States lacking even cursory command of the language -- and an English
father.</TE>
<TE>   His mother "learned to write the English language when I did,"
Atkinson said. "What's made a difference in my life has been higher
education."</TE>

<HD>Bishops Ratify Policy on Abuse</HD>
<DH>At Vatican's insistence, U.S. Catholic prelates amend rules
for dealing with clergy misconduct. Leaders also question plans for
war on Iraq.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's Roman Catholic bishops overwhelmingly approved a policy
on sexually abusive priests Wednesday that they say maintains their
stance of "zero tolerance" but provides accused priests with
procedural protections that Vatican officials had insisted on.</LD>
<LD>   The policy approved by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops
will have the force of mandatory church law after it receives the
final approval of the Vatican, which is expected to happen quickly.
Under the plan, any priest or deacon who has sexually abused a minor
must be removed permanently from ministry. He could also be removed
from the priesthood or deaconate.</LD>
<LD>   In other action, the bishops approved a statement raising doubts
about a war with Iraq. The statement said the bishops "find it
difficult to justify" a war unless there is "clear and adequate
evidence of an imminent attack of a grave nature." They also said
they are "deeply concerned" about a policy of preventive wars "to
overthrow threatening regimes or to deal with weapons of mass
destruction."</LD>
<TE>   The vote on the sexual abuse policy -- 246 to 7 with six
abstentions -- culminated months of efforts by church leaders to end
a debilitating scandal. In the last year, 325 of the church's roughly
46,000 priests have resigned or been removed from ministry, and the
church's credibility has been deeply damaged.</TE>
<TE>   The policy amends an earlier set of rules adopted by the bishops
in June. Vatican officials, though standing with the bishops against
child sexual abuse, declined to approve those rules, saying they
failed to protect accused priests and did not comply with the
church's canon law. The revisions were worked out last month by a
team of U.S. bishops and Vatican officials.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' advocacy groups attacked the revised policy as inadequate
and cumbersome, but the bishops said they believe that, with its
passage, the worst of the scandal is over.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been faithful to our commitment to make sure the church
is safe for children and young people," said Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
of Los Angeles. "There are no loopholes. There are no side doors or
backdoors around this firm policy: No priest or deacon can serve in
ministry of the church who has abused a child."</TE>
<TE>   The vote, said Cardinal Francis George of Chicago, should bring a
conclusion to "this terribly painful scandal" and put the American
church on the path to a "purified and therefore more holy church."</TE>
<TE>   Added Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston: "We have a lot of challenge.
Our work isn't done, but, thank God for where we are today."</TE>
<TE>   The scandal erupted in Law's archdiocese with the disclosure that
the archdiocese had knowingly transferred a pedophile priest from
parish to parish as he continued to molest young boys.</TE>
<TE>   To restore the trust of parishioners, bishops said, they had no
choice but to give up the power to decide for themselves how to treat
accused priests in their dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, some bishops hoped "there might be a
possibility of forgiveness" for priests who had committed a single
act of abuse and then repented, said Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost that.... We don't have that any more. I think maybe some
of us wish we did. We don't.... We faced a real crisis of credibility
with our people. We had no choice but to give it up."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Joseph A. Galante of Dallas added, "Yes, we give up
discretion power. That's the least we could do for having misused it
before."</TE>
<TE>   But that lack of discretion was the main reason for dissent among
the bishops who objected to the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Gerald A. Gettelfinger of Evansville, Ind., who was forced
to remove a popular priest from his parish earlier this year because
of a 10-year-old abuse case, said he could not vote for a policy that
left no room for Christian teachings about forgiveness or conversion.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of St. Peter and St. Paul," Gettelfinger urged. "Jesus took
Peter ... who violated the very Jesus in whom he believed, and not
only reinstated him but made him the leader of our church,"
Gettelfinger said.</TE>
<TE>   But outside the conference hall, victims' advocates said the
policy still had too many potential loopholes. Passage of the policy
is "a very sad day for Catholics," said Mary Grant of the Survivors
Network of those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   The procedures for removal of a priest are complex and would
discourage victims from stepping forward, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Voice of the Faithful, a lay reform group with chapters in several
states that was born after the scandal erupted, charged that the
changes created "a cumbersome procedure" that fails to take the
spiritual and pastoral needs of survivors into account.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new policy, whenever an allegation is made that a priest
or deacon has sexually abused a minor, the bishop will open a
preliminary investigation. If there is "sufficient evidence" that
sexual abuse occurred, the cleric will be immediately placed on
administrative leave and temporarily removed from ministry pending a
church trial.</TE>
<TE>   The policy requires bishops to report any allegation of abuse to
civil authorities for possible prosecution if that is required by
state law. Even in states that do not require such reports, the
bishops have said they will inform officials of all such allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The policy requires bishops to immediately inform the Vatican's
Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, currently headed by Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger, of abuse allegations. That body could refer the
case of an abusive priest to a church tribunal in Rome or send it
back to the local bishop for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the U.S. church does not have tribunals available to
handle potentially large numbers of sexual abuse cases. Bishops said
Wednesday that they probably will set up regional tribunals, but that
doing so could take as long as 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   If a church tribunal finds a cleric guilty, he is to be
permanently removed from ministry. A priest will also be subject to
being removed from the priesthood. That would be in addition to any
punishments handed out by a secular court.</TE>
<TE>   If he were not removed from the priesthood, other limits would be
imposed on a guilty priest, including a prohibition against
celebrating Mass publicly or administering the sacraments. Guilty
priests also would be forbidden from wearing clerical garb or
presenting themselves publicly as priests.</TE>
<TE>   The church currently has a statute of limitations for sex abuse
cases, which requires that complaints be brought within 10 years
after the victim turns 18. Victims' groups have objected to that
limit, saying that in many cases victims do not report abuse until
they are in their 30s or later because of the time it takes to
confront and deal with the trauma.</TE>
<TE>   Under the policy, in cases in which the time limit has expired,
the bishop is required to ask the Vatican to waive the limit so that
a trial may be held.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops also approved a separate measure intended to hold
themselves accountable to one another for any failure to carry out
the provisions of the sexual abuse policy.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops pledged that if one of them is accused of sexually
abusing a minor, he will report the allegation to the metropolitan
bishop in his region. Bishops, however, can be removed only by the
pope.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A look at the new rules:</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the key provisions of the clerical sex abuse
policy approved Wednesday by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
The policy will be reviewed in two years.</TE>
<TE>   All priests guilty of abusing minors will be barred from church
work, ranging from saying Mass to wearing a Roman collar to running a
parish.</TE>
<TE>   Priests who maintain their innocence can ask for a trial before a
tribunal of clerics. If found guilty, they can appeal to the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Bishops must follow local laws on reporting abuse to civil
authorities. The bishops also have promised to report all cases of
abuse of minors to authorities even in states that do not require
that by law.</TE>
<TE>   When an abuse allegation surfaces, bishops must conduct a
preliminary investigation that protects the reputation of the priest,
which means the inquiry can be private. If the bishop determines the
claim is credible, he then puts the clergyman on leave and moves
ahead with a church trial.</TE>
<TE>   Victims must bring claims by age 28, the statute of limitations
under church law, but bishops can ask the Vatican for a waiver to
address older claims.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan review boards including laypeople will advise bishops on
responding to abuse allegations. Their work will be confidential and
five of the board members must be Roman Catholic.</TE>

<HD>UC President Atkinson Announces Retirement</HD>
<DH>The respected leader, whose criticisms led to changes in
the SAT, will step down late next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Trounson and Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>University of California President Richard C. Atkinson, whose
criticisms of the widely used SAT exam helped produce major reforms
in the test and who steered the university through painful debates
about affirmative action, announced Wednesday that he will step down
from his post in October.</LD>
<LD>   Citing what he described as UC's needs and "my own," Atkinson, 73,
said he would stay on to help shepherd the nation's most prestigious
public university system through one more budget cycle -- certain to
be a tough one with possible increases in student fees -- and retire
next fall.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to his leadership in the SAT reform effort, Atkinson
was praised Wednesday for his efforts to make the university system
more accessible to students from all backgrounds despite legal limits
on affirmative action and for his commitment to building the system's
10th campus, at Merced, where ground was broken last month.</LD>
<TE>   At his departure, Atkinson will have headed the nearly
190,000-student system for eight years. That period, he noted, is
longer than all but four of his 16 predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   "These have been extremely rewarding years -- challenging,
stimulating and deeply interesting years -- but the time has come to
bring them to a close," Atkinson told the university's Board of
Regents. It also was time, he said, "for my grandchildren to see more
of their grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   The regents, most of whom said they had not known the announcement
was coming but were not surprised, responded with a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson "has done a magnificent job for this university," said
John J. Moores, the San Diego Padres owner who is chairman of the
regents. He called the announcement "a moment of considerable
sadness."</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson's decision sets in motion what is likely to be a
nationwide search for a successor. Moores will appoint a committee
that, according to policy, will include Gov. Gray Davis, an alumni
regent, a student regent and several other members of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Among the candidates, according to regents and other officials,
are likely to be several of the system's chancellors, including San
Diego's Robert Dynes, UCLA's Albert Carnesale and Santa Barbara's
Henry Yang.</TE>
<TE>   Several said that UC experience would be an advantage, but others
said that at this point, there was no obvious successor and that
non-UC administrators are sure to be considered.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, however, Atkinson will face severe budget
constraints, even as UC struggles to cope with the largest enrollment
increases in its history. The university, together with its
hospitals, this year had a $13-billion operating budget and about
170,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Now it may for the first time in eight years consider raising
fees. Today, regents are scheduled to discuss a preliminary 2003-04
budget that includes a potential 6.5% fee increase for California
residents. Officials said they hoped the increase could be avoided.
Average undergraduate fees for California residents are $4,408 a
year, including health fees but not room and board.</TE>
<TE>   Educators around the state and country said Atkinson, a cognitive
psychologist, would be remembered for his ultimately successful
initiative to remake the SAT, the nation's most widely used college
entrance exam.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the College Board, which owns the test, voted to develop
a new SAT, in the process incorporating many of Atkinson's ideas,
including a writing exam. His goal was to make it more of a measure
of what students learn in high school instead of being an aptitude
test, which Atkinson considered unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "He rang the wake-up bell on admissions for colleges across the
country," said UC San Diego Chancellor Dynes. "It's impossible to
overestimate the influence he had."</TE>
<TE>   Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board, said Atkinson
deserves respect despite their past differences about the SAT. "He
certainly always was straightforward and thoughtful in his criticism
in his search for an answer. His challenge has created not only a
better test for California but, more importantly, a better admissions
test for the whole country."</TE>
<TE>   The UC president had planned to announce his retirement last year
but agreed to stay on at that point at the urging of Gov. Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Wednesday, Davis said Atkinson would rank among the
university's outstanding presidents, and the governor praised him for
increasing UC enrollment by 30,000 students during his tenure and
expanding access to it "for an entire generation of diverse and
talented California students."</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson, who was then chancellor at the UC San Diego campus, was
named UC president in August 1995, one month after the regents had
voted to ban the consideration of race or gender in admissions and
hiring and at a time of considerable tumult for the university. The
affirmative action ban was fiercely opposed by student and faculty
groups, civil rights activists, and Atkinson and chancellors of the
other eight campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he had one of the most painful experiences of his
presidency, being publicly dressed down by then-Gov. Pete Wilson and
conservative UC regents when he tried to delay the ban. Atkinson had
failed to clear the idea with the governor before word leaked out. He
had to back off. But last year, under Davis, Atkinson worked on a
symbolic motion that put the university on record against the ban
even if state law required its enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since, Atkinson has won favorable responses, even
from critics, for his low-key, consensus-building approach to
university governance, consulting each of the university's often
prickly constituencies, from its faculty to the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Ward Connerly, the board's most outspoken conservative and
frequent Atkinson critic, said that he and the UC president had
"disagreed on any number of issues over the years."</TE>
<TE>   "But as a man, I have profound respect for him," said Connerly,
who led the fight to ban affirmative action at UC, then statewide
with Proposition 209. "He has steered this university through some
difficult times."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Atkinson has presided over a series of changes to
admissions policies.They include a program to grant admission to the
top 4% of graduates from each of the state's high schools, and
another known as "comprehensive admissions," under which personal
factors are considered alongside academic achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Elaine White Alquist (D-Santa Clara), who worked
closely with Atkinson as chairwoman of the Assembly's committee on
higher education, said Atkinson's experience as a psychologist helped
him understand the importance of all facets of a student's
performance and life.</TE>
<TE>   "When he stood up and said we need to open up the admissions
process and look at the total student -- not just their test score --
I think the world and the UC system listened to him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson said Wednesday that in retirement, he will return to San
Diego, where he hopes to spend more time with his wife, Rita, and his
two young grandchildren and to get "at least eight hours of sleep a
night."</TE>
<TE>   After spending decades in high-profile public leadership roles he
is looking forward to some rest. "I'm due," he said.</TE>

<HD>EPA to Enact Long-Contested Smog Standard</HD>
<DH>A court settlement with environmental groups requires the
agency to begin enforcing the pollution rules, stymied five years by
challenges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision that could signal a broad, new assault on smog, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed Wednesday to put in place
a long-contested pollution standard that will make the air cleaner by
increasing regulations in dozens of cities from coast to coast.</LD>
<LD>   A court settlement between the EPA and environmental groups
requires the EPA to begin enforcing the standard, which has been
stymied for the last five years by lawsuits and industry challenges.</LD>
<LD>   The new standard, developed in 1997 under the Clinton
administration, allows less ozone, one of the two most pernicious air
pollutants.</LD>
<TE>   In all, about 320 communities in 38 states could be reclassified
as "non-attainment." That designation would require them to prepare
smog-cleanup plans and implement them in a timely manner. Half of
California's 58 counties would not be able to meet the new eight-hour
ozone standard.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, California's ozone standard has been the most
restrictive in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Some communities that have never imposed smog controls will be
required to do so for the first time. Others, including San
Francisco, Ventura and San Diego, which have largely complied with
the existing smog standard, will have to make additional emissions
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new chapter. We're going to have air-pollution standards
based on science, and the science shows that air isn't safe to
breathe," said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.
"There will be some new costs, but we're getting cleaner air in
return, fewer cases of asthma, less emphysema and more days kids can
play outside."</TE>
<TE>   Industry representatives warn that the costs will be prohibitive
and will lead to regulations that will be onerous to businesses all
over the country.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most expensive environmental regulations ever.
This will affect just about everybody," said Jeffrey Marks, director
of air quality for the National Assn. of Manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "It will mark hundreds of new counties as Clean Air Act violators.
It's going to label areas with a stigma that will create a negative
perception. Businesses will be unlikely to invest in those areas
where there are excessive costs due to regulation. It will result in
loss of jobs and decreased investment in those areas."</TE>
<TE>   Even though all smoggy cities in California and the rest of the
nation are already subject to smog-abatement measures established
under the Clean Air Act, there is widespread agreement among health
experts that those measures do not adequately protect public health.</TE>
<TE>   In the settlement filed Wednesday with U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., the EPA agreed to designate cities that fail to
meet the new ozone standard by April 2004. Under that limit, ozone
cannot exceed more than 0.08 parts per million during any eight-hour
period.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is stricter than the existing national standard, which
restricts ozone that people are exposed to during a one-hour period,
and offers more protection for people, including children,
construction workers and others who spend considerable time outdoors.
Ozone is a colorless gas that damages lung tissue and causes
headaches and nausea.</TE>
<TE>   Under a separate, but related, effort, the EPA has already begun
to identify communities that fail to meet a 1997 standard for
microscopic particles, called PM2.5.</TE>
<TE>   New limits for those tiny flecks, a fraction of the diameter of a
human hair, were established at the same time as the new ozone
standard and will begin to take effect by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Although California is the nation's smoggiest state, communities
likely to be most affected by the EPA's decision are in the Midwest
and Southeast. Those regions are home to more lenient pollution
controls and to many old, heavily polluting power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-smog measures long used in California, including Smog Check
and vapor recovery nozzles at gas stations, could be instituted for
the first time from Sheboygan, Wis., to Jefferson County, Mo., to
Jeffersonville, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   How much the new regulations will cost is open to debate. The EPA
says costs could reach $60 billion, although industry groups say it
will be more.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA says better air-quality standards will prevent 15,000
premature deaths, 350,000 cases of asthma and 1 million cases of
diminished lung function in children.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturers' group, the American Truckers Assns., and the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce were among several business groups that sued
the Clinton administration to block the new pollution standards. The
fight reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which affirmed broad portions
of the plan, but sent other parts back to the lower court for review.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the U.S. Court of Appeals removed the remaining
objections, although no dates were established for the EPA to begin
proceeding with the new air-quality standards until Wednesday's court
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA will have to determine how much time each community has to
comply with the new standard. That will be decided on a case-by-case
basis as the EPA gathers more pollution data on various cities in the
next couple of years. A community's failure to meet the new standard
can result in loss of federal highway improvement funds and penalties
that restrict economic development.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be up to the EPA to decide whether to impose those
sanctions, actions that the agency has often been reluctant to take.</TE>

<HD>FBI Agents Honored for Helping Solve 1963 Church Bomb Case</HD>
<DH>The pair's work on a case with an 'incredibly cold trail'
is lauded. Two Klansmen were found guilty in the blast that killed
four black girls.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bill Fleming and Ben Herren spent six years reviewing dusty evidence
volumes and barely audible tapes to secure the convictions of two men
who bombed an Alabama church almost 40 years ago, killing four black
girls.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the FBI agents were recognized as Federal Employees
of the Year and the parents of one of the victims were on hand to
present the awards.</LD>
<LD>   "Any time an investigator works a case, the only hope he has is to
be able to get it to a judge and jury," said Herren, who was a
Birmingham, Ala., police sergeant when the case was assigned to him
in 1996. He then transferred to the FBI a year later.</LD>
<TE>   "They don't look down the road to something like this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation immediately following the 1963 blast at the 16th
Street Baptist Church produced no charges, although four white
supremacists were long suspected. Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill Baxley
helped lead a 1977 conviction of one of them, Robert Chambliss, who
died in prison in 1985. A second suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming and Herren helped prove the guilt of Bobby Frank Cherry
and Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr., Ku Klux Klan members now serving life
terms in prison for murder.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very negative about it, because there was a lack of
evidence," said Fleming, who will retire from the FBI on Jan. 3. "It
was an incredibly cold trail. We had nothing going for us, just
nothing. As the investigation progressed, people started coming out
of the woodwork."</TE>
<TE>   Herren said that was particularly the case with Cherry, who held a
news conference to proclaim his innocence after the FBI stopped by
for a surprise interview. Several witnesses Herren did not know
existed began calling, telling about Cherry's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Blanton's conviction was sealed after investigators carefully
reviewed a conversation between him and his wife, picked up on a
microphone that had been planted under his kitchen sink. FBI labs in
the 1960s could not make out the words, but modern technology
revealed he was talking about going to the river to plot the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was skeptical at first, Herren now realizes it was
necessary to reopen the investigation. People who had information
were reticent because they thought authorities had given up, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, there was no active investigation they knew of, and
they were scared," Herren said. "One thing that hurt the
investigation early on was that people were just afraid to talk. Even
though the Klan was a paper tiger with no teeth, the fear that once
was with the Klan still took over."</TE>
<TE>   That changed when the unsolved murders were exposed again to the
public.</TE>
<TE>   The father of 11-year-old victim Denise McNair called the awards
long overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very deserved honor," said Chris McNair, in Washington for
the ceremony Wednesday with his wife, Maxine. "These two people are
wonderful people anyway. If you just knew them on the street, you'd
never know they were FBI agents."</TE>
<TE>   Herren said having the McNairs in the courtroom helped get him
through two often tumultuous trials.</TE>
<TE>   "I could look back at them, and it gave me some strength," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming and Herren will receive $5,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Others recognized at the Service to America ceremony include a
Coast Guard official who directed the seaborne evacuation of Lower
Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks and an Army Corps of Engineers
worker credited with refusing orders to falsify data.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Broad Waiver for Pentagon on Migratory Birds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Wednesday passed and sent to the president compromise
legislation designed to give the Defense Department a broad exemption
from the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which protects 850 species
of birds from harmful practices.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which passed the House on Tuesday, is only a partial
victory for the Pentagon, which had sought exemptions from eight
landmark environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. Nonetheless, environmentalists and their supporters
in Congress were outraged at the migratory bird waiver.</LD>
<LD>   "The provision, which was inserted at the Bush administration's
request, will effectively give the Defense Department license to bomb
and destroy at will the natural habitats of migratory birds,
endangering more than 1 million birds and curtailing the enjoyment of
more than 50 million bird enthusiasts in this country," said Rep.
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.).</LD>
<TE>   The measure was inserted into the $393-billion defense
authorization bill, which approves funds for a variety of military
programs, during a conference committee meeting, in which a small
group of Senate and House members hammered out the differences
between their two versions of the bill. The House version contained
an exemption; the Senate's did not.</TE>
<TE>   The provision passed Wednesday would give the Defense Department
an interim exemption from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and would
direct the Interior secretary within a year to come up with
regulations permanently exempting military readiness activities from
the law. The provision also would require the military to take
appropriate actions to avoid unnecessarily killing or harming
migratory birds, and to monitor the effect of the exemption on birds.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress who supported the military's requests for
exemptions were angered that Congress had given the military so
little of what it had asked for, especially at a time when it is
poised to put American forces in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   "The secretary of Defense submitted eight ideas; we enacted half
of one," said Rep. James V. Hansen (R-Utah), chairman of the House
Resources Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said that because the migratory bird provision would shift
responsibility to the Interior secretary, rather than writing the
exemption into law, delays and lawsuits would be likely to keep the
military from getting what it wants.</TE>
<TE>   "That is going to open up a can of worms and is clearly not going
to be sufficient even over the short term," Hansen added.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon and its supporters in Congress argued that
environmental laws have been inhibiting training at bases across the
country and on the waters offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The Migratory Bird Treaty Act had caused the Pentagon a particular
headache since March, when a U.S. district court in Washington held
that the military must comply with the act.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Biological Diversity, an Arizona-based
environmental organization, had sued the Defense Department because
the Navy conducts bombing exercises on Farallon de Medinilla, a
200-acre island in the middle of the Pacific that is part of the
Northern Mariana Islands. Many birds are killed during those
exercises, including some protected by the act, such as the
Micronesian megapode, which is on the endangered species list; great
frigatebirds; and three types of boobys -- masked, red-footed and
brown.</TE>
<TE>   The judge ordered the Defense Department to stop the bombing until
it came into compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. During
the case, a government lawyer argued that bird lovers benefit when
the military kills birds because "bird watchers get more enjoyment
spotting a rare bird than they do spotting a common one."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Emmet G. Sullivan reprimanded the government for that
argument. "There is absolutely no support in the law for the view
that environmentalists should get enjoyment out of the destruction of
natural resources," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Galvin, the California and Pacific director for the Center
for Biological Diversity, said his organization would try to fight
the exemption through the courts and in Congress. He blamed the Bush
administration for creating a climate that encouraged such actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The current administration's attitude toward environmental law is
summed up by their submission in the case that environmentalists and
birders should enjoy bombing because it makes birds rarer," Galvin
said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Eight passengers have become ill aboard a cruise ship where a virus
sickened more than 400 people on three recent voyages, cruise
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Workers sanitized Holland America's Amsterdam before it left Fort
Lauderdale on Monday carrying 1,316 passengers on a 10-day Caribbean
cruise, the company said. By Wednesday, eight people were sick with
the same Norwalk-type virus symptoms, Holland America representative
Erik Elvejord said.</LD>
<LD>   "Since the ship's at sea we're asking them to stay in the cabins
and we're bringing them food," Elvejord said.</LD>
<TE>   While not considered serious, the virus strikes people with up to
two days of diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain.</TE>
<TE>   The virus struck a total of 425 passengers and crew members on the
ship's last three voyages, company officials said.</TE>

<HD>Boston D Party Brewing for 2004</HD>
<DH>Democrats will have their next presidential nomination
convention there. They were enticed with offer of $20 million to help
pay for the gala.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that Boston
will host the party's 2004 presidential nominating convention.</LD>
<LD>   At a symbolic level, the decision will carry the Democrats to one
of the nation's most liberal states, even as the party in the 2000
and 2002 elections had difficulty reaching voters in more culturally
conservative regions of the country.</LD>
<LD>   At a practical level, though, the decision ensures Democrats a
friendly reception from a city government led by a Democrat, Mayor
Thomas Menino. He lobbied relentlessly for the convention, with the
formidable assistance of party stalwart Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts.</LD>
<TE>   Democratic sources said several factors contributed to the
decision to pick Boston over New York and Detroit, the other cities
under serious consideration. (Miami, another finalist, faded as a
legitimate contender during the final review process, the sources
said.)</TE>
<TE>   Aides said DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe ruled out New York partly
because of the party's experience working with a Republican mayor,
then-Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, during the 2000 convention in
L.A. Many Democrats complained that the city did not live up to many
of its financial and logistical commitments.</TE>
<TE>   That made McAuliffe leery of entrusting the event to another
Republican, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Democrats were also
concerned that Republicans might select New York as their convention
site.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to go where Republicans are going to go," DNC press
secretary Jennifer Palmieri said.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit lost out, officials said, largely out of concern that it
lacked enough hotel rooms for the thousands of delegates, journalists
and others who flock to the conventions. DNC officials stressed that
Detroit will be a leading contender for the 2008 event.</TE>
<TE>   Menino impressed Democrats with a proposal that included $20
million in private funds to help pay for the convention, use of the
new Fleet Center to host it and ample lodging.</TE>
<TE>   The gathering, scheduled for July 26-29, 2004, will mark the first
time Boston has hosted a national convention for either of the two
major parties.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that its time was long overdue, and we're proud to help
this great city make history," McAuliffe said in announcing the
choice. "Maybe we can even set a trend and help Boston end another
long drought -- a Democratic convention for Boston and a World Series
championship for the Red Sox ... all in the same year."</TE>
<TE>   The decision has intriguing implications for Sen. John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, who is expected to be one of the leading contenders
for the party's 2004 nomination. If Kerry wins, the convention
presumably would become a triumphant embrace of him.</TE>
<TE>   But if he loses -- especially in an acrimonious race -- the
gathering could put him in a somewhat awkward position.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are planning their convention for Aug. 30 to Sept. 2,
2004. Along with New York, the leading contenders are New Orleans and
Tampa, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers' Drive to Draft Energy Bill Comes Up Empty</HD>
<DH>A sticking point was alternative power sources.
Republicans, who will control the next Congress, pledged to revive
the measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An energy bill that grew out of California's electricity crisis and
became one of President Bush's domestic priorities quietly died in
Congress on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans, who will control the House and the Senate in the next
Congress, pledged to revive the measure when lawmakers convene in
January.</LD>
<LD>   But with time running out on this year's lame-duck session,
Democratic and Republican negotiators had too many issues left to
resolve. One key sticking point was whether the measure should
require utilities to generate more energy from alternative sources,
such as sun and wind.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, the negotiators reached bipartisan agreement on one
point Wednesday: No compromise measure was going to emerge this year.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, expressed optimism that next
year "an even better and bigger bill" will be approved.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a roadmap in place after months of very difficult
negotiations," spokesman Ken Johnson said. "We know where the hairpin
turns are located. We expect a lot smoother ride in 2003."</TE>
<TE>   But Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, was more pessimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "The political will to act did not match the rhetoric of the past
two years on the need to address looming problems, such as
electricity reform, natural gas supply, and our increasing thirst for
foreign oil for transportation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the task of coming up with a comprehensive approach to
energy policy, absent a major crisis, will only grow more difficult
in the next Congress," he added.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill's demise pleased some.</TE>
<TE>   California officials had strongly objected to a provision that
would have required ethanol to be added to gasoline, contending that
it would increase fuel prices.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists complained that the bill was heavy on production
and short on conservation. "We're thrilled" by the deadlock on the
bill, said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   But J. Jon Doggett, vice president of public policy for the
National Corn Growers Assn., said he was "very disappointed" by the
stalemate. He called the bill a "victim of politics" and of "many
interests competing against one another."</TE>
<TE>   Doggett's group strongly backed the bill's provision on ethanol,
which is produced mostly from corn.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said Bush hopes to see
comprehensive energy legislation "high on the agenda" when Congress
returns next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We made good progress this year," she said. "The president
believes that it is an important issue that Congress needs to address
immediately upon returning next year."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, a former oilman, seized on high energy prices nationwide and
California's electricity crunch to unveil an energy bill in May 2001
that stressed the need for more domestic oil and gas exploration.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's controversial elements included Bush's call for
opening up a portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for
drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these and other disputes, lawmakers in both parties
embraced the need for a major bill that would decrease U.S. reliance
on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   But enthusiasm for the energy bill waned after California's
electricity crisis and gasoline prices eased.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations were further lowered when the Democratic-led Senate
rejected Bush's Arctic refuge drilling proposal, and the House and
Senate failed to approve tougher vehicle mileage standards that
environmentalists wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The elimination of both those major initiatives from the bill
lessened the incentive for Republicans and Democrats to reach
agreement on a final measure.</TE>
<TE>   Still, competing versions of energy bills passed by the House and
Senate ran hundreds of pages and included a number of other measures,
such as tax breaks for conservation and energy production.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, lawmakers decided it was better to have no bill
than one that would make a modest dent -- if even that -- in the
nation's dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   "Our country needs a strong, farsighted energy bill," said Rep.
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), one of the measure's critics, "This
isn't it."</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin made a last-ditch effort to get the Senate to pass a
stripped-down bill that would include a pipeline safety measure and
extend a cap on the nuclear industry's liability in accidents, a
provision designed to remove an obstacle to expansion of nuclear
power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Senate negotiators rejected that, although a separate pipeline
safety measure still may be approved by the House and Senate today.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are still hopeful that Bush's popularity and a
possible war against Iraq will increase support for future White
House energy proposals.</TE>
<TE>   But even next year, with Republicans in control of the House and
Senate, Bush will face difficulty winning approval of opening the
Arctic refuge to drilling. That proposal is certain to face a
filibuster by Democrats that would be difficult to overcome.</TE>

<LD>A man who shot a couple to death in front of their four children at a
rest stop 22 years ago was executed by injection Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   William Putman, 59, had told his attorneys to drop his final
appeals Tuesday. The Pardons and Paroles Board considered and denied
him clemency, even though he didn't seek it, a spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said Putman approached a family sleeping at a rest area
off Interstate 75 on July 10, 1980, shot David Hardin and demanded
that Katie Hardin leave with him, witnesses testified. She refused
and was shot in the head as she screamed for her dying husband.</LD>

<HD>Tentative N.Y. Fire Accord Reached</HD>
<DH>Budget crisis and the Sept. 11 terror attacks slowed
negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>City Hall and the firefighters' union reached a tentative agreement
Wednesday on a wage increase after drawn-out negotiations complicated
by a budget crisis and the hero status accorded New York's
firefighters after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The firefighters would receive a retroactive 10% raise for the two
years they worked without a contract, union president Steve Cassidy
said. The agreement is subject to ratification by the union's 9,000
firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this is as good as we could possibly do," said Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg. "I wish we could afford to pay them more."</LD>
<TE>   Some firefighters also welcomed the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "With the climate in City Hall and so forth, I really didn't see
them doing that much for us," said nine-year firefighter Martin
Hurley.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders, politicians and celebrities have called for
firefighters to receive what they call just compensation for their
sacrifices of Sept. 11 when 343 firefighters died.</TE>
<TE>   The period covered by the raise ended in June. Cassidy said the
union would begin negotiating another contract.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means do I feel this package represents the value of what
our members are truly worth," he said. "Given the circumstances,
given the hand we were dealt from, we felt that this is the best we
could do."</TE>
<TE>   Rank-and-file firefighters have worked for more than two years
without a raise or union contract. A recruit earns about $31,000 a
year. After 20 years, salaries can reach about $55,000.</TE>
<TE>   With a $42-billion annual budget, New York City faces an estimated
deficit of $5 billion to $6 billion next year.</TE>

<HD>Almighty to Remain in Pledge and Motto</HD>
<DH>Bush signs bill in wake of a court ruling that references
to God violate Constitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday signed into law a bill reaffirming --
with a slap at the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- references to
God in the Pledge of Allegiance and the national motto.</LD>
<LD>   Bush signed the bill without comment. It reinforces support for
the words "under God" in the pledge, and for "In God we trust" as the
national motto.</LD>
<LD>   The bill was approved unanimously in the Senate and drew just five
no votes in the House. Congress rushed to act after the federal
appeals court in California ruled in June that the phrase "under
God," inserted into the pledge by Congress in 1954, amounted to a
government endorsement of religion in violation of the constitutional
separation of church and state. The legislation faulted the court for
its "erroneous rationale" and "absurd result."</LD>
<TE>   The new law also modifies the manner in which the Pledge of
Allegiance is to be delivered by stating that, when not in uniform,
men should remove any nonreligious headdress with their right hand
and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart.
Previously, the standard dictated that "any headdress" be removed.</TE>
<TE>   Those House members voting against the bill, all Democrats, were
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, Jim McDermott of Washington, Robert C.
Scott of Virginia and two Californians -- Michael M. Honda of San
Jose and Pete Stark of Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Scott called the bill "totally gratuitous," even
though he shared the majority's objections to the court's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Four House Democrats -- Gary L. Ackerman and Nydia M. Velazquez of
New York, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Melvin L. Watt of North
Carolina -- voted present.</TE>

<HD>Conservatives Make Gains in GOP Congress</HD>
<DH>DeLay and his deputies move up in the House, and Lott will
be Senate majority leader. The party pushes for a quick lame-duck
session.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The full impact of the GOP's new political clout swept across Capitol
Hill on Wednesday, as House and Senate Republicans chose a phalanx of
conservative leaders for the new Congress and pushed to finish the
current lame-duck session by week's end.</LD>
<LD>   In the House, Republicans promoted Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas),
already one of the most powerful members in Congress, to the No. 2
post of majority leader. They also installed several of his deputies
in other key posts.</LD>
<LD>   In the Senate, Republicans prepared to assume control in January
by picking Trent Lott (R-Miss.) as majority leader. That gives him
another shot at a job he lost in mid-2001 when Sen. James M.
Jeffords' decision to defect from the GOP and become an independent
gave Democrats control of the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   The newly empowered GOP leadership pledged to work
shoulder-to-shoulder with the White House. And Republican lawmakers
are looking to their leaders to deliver legislative accomplishments
now that the party will be in charge of both branches of Congress as
well as the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "No excuses now; we have it all," said Sen.-elect Lindsey O.
Graham (R-S.C.). "We have nobody to blame but ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   "It puts a lot of pressure on us -- but it's the right kind of
pressure," said Sen.-elect Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders face the challenge of balancing their loyalty to
President Bush against competing political interests of their rank
and file. And they will have to manage tensions between the
conservative-dominated House and the Senate, where moderate
Republicans have more sway.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the flush of victory, there were small signs of such
strains. House Republicans are resisting administration pressure to
pass a terrorism insurance bill that includes liability provisions
they oppose. The measure would provide a federal safety net to the
insurance industry for terrorist attacks, and Bush has warned that
failing to pass it would hurt the economy.</TE>
<TE>   This dispute notwithstanding, Republicans are under heavy pressure
to forge a united front.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more than a honeymoon," said Jade West, a business lobbyist
who until recently was an aide to the Senate Republican leadership.
"Even those who are antsy -- there's no way they are going to pick a
public fight with the president of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   And even in this week's lame-duck session, where Democrats
nominally retain majority control of the Senate, Republicans have
flexed their political muscle. They jammed through the House on
Wednesday the homeland security bill written largely on the
president's terms. Although many expected the lame-duck session to
last until Thanksgiving or beyond, Republicans are pushing hard --
with apparent success -- to wrap it up by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   That expedited schedule cuts short Democrats' last hurrah and puts
off several major decisions until next year when the GOP has more
power.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, where Republicans will hold at least five more seats
next year than they do now, J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) is expected to
be reelected House speaker in January.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the House GOP leadership team was in for changes
because Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) is retiring. DeLay is
moving up from his current No. 3 post of House majority whip.</TE>
<TE>   Other leadership positions changed hands, as Republicans elected
Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri to succeed DeLay as whip; Rep. Deborah
Pryce of Ohio to be Republican Conference chairwoman; and Rep. Thomas
M. Reynolds of New York to be chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee. All three are DeLay lieutenants who enjoyed
his support in defeating rivals for their posts.</TE>
<TE>   "DeLay is the Vito Corleone of the House," said Steve Moore, head
of the conservative political group Club for Growth. "Everyone now in
leadership basically was put there by him."</TE>
<TE>   A feisty conservative, DeLay plays a hardball game of politics:
His prolific fund-raising and aggressive arm-twisting have earned him
the nickname "The Hammer."</TE>
<TE>   DeLay made a joking reference to that moniker Wednesday after
Blunt won the whip's job. DeLay handed his successor a velvet-encased
hammer, saying Blunt had a "softer touch."</TE>
<TE>   DeLay's skills served him well in the whip's job, which he won
after Republicans took control of the House in the 1994 elections. As
whip, DeLay has been responsible for corralling votes and maintaining
party discipline in the House.</TE>
<TE>   As majority leader, he will have a different set of
responsibilities, including setting the legislative schedule and
coordinating the work of powerful committee chairmen. A key question
is whether DeLay will also take on the leader's traditional role as
party spokesman to the media and the public.</TE>
<TE>   It may be politically risky for the GOP if DeLay raises his public
profile. Known for his often provocative rhetoric and unrelenting
partisanship, he has been depicted by Democrats as the epitome of
right-wing extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans say the question is moot because all GOP leaders
in Congress will be eclipsed by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "The prevailing winds are now blowing in from the White House,"
said John Feehery, press secretary for Hastert. "Our party spokesman
is the president for all intents and purposes."</TE>
<TE>   DeLay also may be called upon to mediate potential intraparty
tensions between Bush's interest in broadening the GOP base with a
more centrist agenda and conservative activists who may want the
party to use its congressional majority to take a sharper turn to the
right.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the big challenge -- balancing the go-slow approach of the
White House versus the conservative sprinters who want to rush to the
goal line," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP's leadership ranks in the next House will include two
Californians. Rep. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach was reelected
chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and Rep. John T.
Doolittle of Rocklin was chosen secretary of the Republican
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans, after electing Lott majority leader, chose
Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as their new No. 2 leader. McConnell
is a conservative best known for his staunch opposition to the
campaign finance reform measure that finally passed Congress earlier
this year. The job of assistant GOP leader came open because
term-limit rules forced Don Nickles of Oklahoma to step down. Also
joining the GOP leadership team was Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) as policy
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Although that makes for a solidly conservative leadership team, it
will still be harder for the Senate -- with its loose rules and
strong minority rights -- to easily pass the kind of conservative
agenda the House is likely to produce.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats by acclamation reelected their leadership team
for the new Congress, headed by Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   House Democrats meet today and are expected to elect Rep. Nancy
Pelosi of San Francisco as minority leader.</TE>

<HD>Homeland Security Bill Easily Passes in House</HD>
<DH>Measure receives strong bipartisan support, and Senate vote
is expected soon. But indecision on spending issues leaves key
initiatives in limbo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The House gave strong bipartisan approval Wednesday to
a bill that would create a Cabinet department to coordinate America's
defenses against terrorism, and the Senate moved with new urgency to
follow suit within days.</LD>
<LD>   But the decisive steps to reorganize the federal government in
response to last year's terrorist attacks contrasted with
congressional indecision on government spending that left many
high-profile homeland security initiatives in limbo.</LD>
<LD>   Two House votes showed the conflicting pressures on lawmakers as
they pushed toward a belated conclusion to the year's business.</LD>
<TE>   First, the Republican-led House voted 270 to 143 to approve a
stopgap spending bill that would fund most government operations only
at current levels until mid-January. Most opponents were Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, billions of dollars in planned increases to ramp up
the Coast Guard and the Customs Service, hire hundreds of Border
Patrol agents, bolster state and local anti-terrorism programs and
step up other domestic security programs were postponed.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, the House approved on a 299-121 vote what is
apparently the final version of the most significant overhaul of the
executive branch in the last half a century, a plan to forge a new
Department of Homeland Security out of 22 agencies now scattered
throughout the government.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate was driving toward the same outcomes on both bills. The
White House and Senate Republicans prevailed in a handful of
preliminary Senate votes on the government reorganization, as
Democrats largely conceded a fight over worker rights within the new
department. President Bush won most of the powers he sought to revise
civil service rules and, if necessary, waive labor agreements. Final
Senate action on the homeland security bill and the spending bill was
expected this week or next.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and the Bush administration hailed both bills, saying
the congressional actions would allow Bush to keep a rein on purse
strings while moving swiftly to build what will be, with about
170,000 employees, the third-largest department in his Cabinet, after
Defense and Veterans Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But many Democrats said that the GOP and the White House were
paying lip service to homeland security while refusing to pay for
initiatives that would offer concrete protection to the American
people.</TE>
<TE>   "Osama will be glad," fumed Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the
ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. He said the
Republican decision to postpone appropriations decisions until next
year would give Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden "openings to do his
dirty work."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there was little that Democrats could do other than protest
or wave through two bills seen as critical before the expected
adjournment of the 107th Congress in coming days. Bush has seized the
legislative offensive after the GOP's expansion of its House majority
and capture of the Senate in last week's midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to postpone spending decisions until after the 108th
Congress convenes in January marked a capitulation by lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has often sought to restrict the congressional power of the
purse as far as possible. By maneuvering Congress into another
stopgap spending bill -- this one is due to expire Jan. 11 -- he
ensured the death of 11 of the 13 annual appropriations bills for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Only two military spending bills made
it into law, mainly on Bush's terms. Many of the expiring bills
contain items both political parties view as critical to the nation's
defense against terrorism. No one disputes, for example, that state
and local police and firefighters need more money from the federal
government to respond to catastrophes.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, there is no partisan quarrel over the need for enhanced
nuclear security, bioterrorism defense, border protections and other
measures to remedy vulnerabilities exposed by the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But now Bush will be able to sift through and reshape those
proposals within the context of a new executive agency to oversee
homeland security. Congress is about to approve the security agency
he endorsed in June, months after Democrats raised the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 484-page bill the House approved -- which reflected
negotiations with senators and the White House -- the new department
would have four main pillars:</TE>
<TE>   * A division of information analysis and infrastructure protection
would coordinate with the CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies to
assess threats.</TE>
<TE>   * A division of science and technology would promote measures to
defend against nuclear, chemical or biological attacks.</TE>
<TE>   * A division of emergency preparedness and response -- built
around the current Federal Emergency Management Agency -- would
respond to disasters.</TE>
<TE>   * And the largest division, for border and transportation
security, would encompass what is now the Customs Service, the
Transportation Security Administration and the Border Patrol. Its
difficult mission: "preventing the entry of terrorists and the
instruments of terrorism into the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Other units within the department would include the Secret
Service, Coast Guard and a new Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration
Services. Under the bill, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
would be abolished and nearly all of its employees would be moved to
the new department from the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   In another shakeup, the bill would move most of the agency now
known as Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from the Treasury Department
to Justice and rename it the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives. With that move, Treasury would lose nearly all of its
law-enforcement functions -- aside from those related to trade and
revenue collection.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would authorize the new department to deputize
commercial airline pilots who volunteer to carry firearms in the
cockpit as "federal flight deck officers." Many lawmakers demanded
that pilots be allowed to carry guns after hijackers took over four
large jets last year using little more than box cutters as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the bill would extend for as long as a year the Dec.
31 deadline for airports to screen all checked baggage with
bomb-detection machines.</TE>
<TE>   The House vote for the bill showed continuing support for the
president's reorganization plan. In July, a version was approved on a
295-132 vote. On Wednesday, 87 Democrats joined 212 Republicans in
voting for the bill. Six Republicans, 114 Democrats and one
independent were opposed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's long overdue," said Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman
of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. "It will
vastly improve our nation's defense, and it obviously is a critical
component of the war on terror, particularly in our homeland, where
we live. I think we have found something the American people are
going to cheer about."</TE>
<TE>   The bill becomes effective 60 days after enactment. There will be
a transition of at least one year, and perhaps longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Some parts of it may take time," acknowledged a White House
spokesman, Scott McClellan. "But we will move as quickly as we can to
begin that process. We already are making preparations."</TE>

<HD>Group Urges Steps to Prevent Anti-Muslim Hate Crimes</HD>
<DH>Report says government officials should have been better
prepared for the violence against Arab Americans that occurred after
Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianne Aryanpur</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A human rights group commended the swift state and federal response
to increased hate crimes against Muslims after the Sept. 11 attacks
but said government should have anticipated the wave of violence and
taken steps to head it off.</LD>
<LD>   In a 41-page report, New York-based Human Rights Watch asserted
that as long as conflict in the Middle East continues and further
terrorism in the United States remains likely, government officials
must expect more hate crimes against the Muslim community and focus
on preventing it.</LD>
<LD>   The report, to be released today and drawing on FBI data,
documented a 17-fold increase in hate crimes against Muslims in six
cities with large Arab populations or large numbers of hate crimes --
Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Phoenix, New York and Dearborn, Mich.
These figures compare all of 2001 with all of the previous year, with
the bulk of the incidents in 2001 occurring after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI said Los Angeles County reported that anti-Arab hate
crimes shot up from 12 in 2000 to 188 in 2001, slightly below the
six-city average.</TE>
<TE>   "In many cases, government officials responded quickly and
vigorously to the backlash violence," the Human Rights Watch report
said. "President Bush and numerous state and city officials publicly
condemned anti-Arab hate crimes."</TE>
<TE>   But the report also found fault. "Government officials didn't sit
on their hands while Muslims and Arabs were attacked after Sept. 11,
but law enforcement and other government agencies should have been
better prepared for this kind of onslaught," said Amardeep Singh,
U.S. programs researcher at Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Singh said "backlash" hate crimes against American Muslims were
predictable given the increased violence against Muslims after the
Persian Gulf War and the Oklahoma City bombing.</TE>
<TE>   While officials ultimately linked the Oklahoma bombing to an
American terrorist, many Americans first assumed that Arab terrorists
were behind the attack. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a
Muslim civil rights organization, recorded more than 200 incidents of
Muslim harassment or assault in the days after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, a pall of suspicion has been cast over Arabs and
Muslims in the United States," Singh said. "Public officials can
reduce bias violence against them by ensuring that the 'war against
terrorism' is focused on criminal behavior rather than whole
communities."</TE>
<TE>   The report recommended enhancing programs already in effect in at
least some of the six cities. It praised the local and state
governments that held news conferences, established community
outreach programs and deployed police at Muslim gathering places to
prevent crimes. The Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission
notified police of potential "hot spots" such as mosques and
Arab-owned convenience stores, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these are very legitimate areas of concern," said Council
on American-Islamic Relations spokeswoman Hodan Hassan. She
underscored the need for establishing better relations between law
enforcement and American Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "We can start by sensitizing law enforcement officials to the
needs of the Muslim community through diversity training that will
teach them what is Islam, what do these people believe in, what are
their customs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan pointed to a recent case in which law enforcement officials
worked with community members in Florida to thwart a potential
bomber. "This sort of relationship, building between law enforcement
and the Muslim community, is where you start," Hassan said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Clears Obstacles to Its Annual Pay Increase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Wednesday voted to give itself its annual pay raise,
the fourth time lawmakers' salaries have risen in the last four
years.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate, without debate, voted, 58 to 36, to reject a measure
by Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) that would have denied the
congressional pay raise.</LD>
<LD>   With the slumping economy and financial markets, job layoffs and
federal budget deficits, "this is the wrong time for Congress to give
itself a pay hike," Feingold said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   The House cleared the way for the raise in July.</TE>
<TE>   With the 3.1% pay raise, senators and representatives will make
$154,700 next year instead of the $150,000 they made this year.
Lawmakers' salaries have gone up $18,000 since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1989 law, congressional pay raises, determined by a
complicated formula that includes a measure of private industry
employment costs, go into effect automatically unless lawmakers vote
to block them.</TE>
<TE>   The pay raise, which will go into effect in January, will also
apply to more than 1,000 top executive branch officials, including
the vice president and members of the congressional leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The president's salary of $400,000 a year is unaffected by the
congressional increase.</TE>
<TE>   The first members of Congress received $6 a day.</TE>
<TE>   In 1855, compensation was set at $3,000 a year. It hit $10,000 in
1935, $60,000 in 1979, and went above $100,000 in 1991. The pay level
stalled at $133,600 during the mid-1990s, with lawmakers wary of
giving themselves a raise when the federal budget was in deficit, but
it has risen steadily since then.</TE>

<HD>High Court Hears Challenges to Megan's Laws</HD>
<DH>Justices, who appeared skeptical during questioning, will
decide if states can post names of paroled sex offenders on the
Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Megan's laws, which permit home buyers, employers and other
interested people in all 50 states to check computer listings of
paroled sex offenders, came under challenge in the Supreme Court for
the first time Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Two divergent views were voiced during oral arguments. The
measures represent either a new and modern way of informing parents
about a potential danger in their neighborhoods or a cruel public
branding of ex-offenders who have served their time.</LD>
<LD>   "This is like shaming ... in the town square," said Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg. The ex-offender has his "face plastered on the
Internet," she said, suggesting he represents a danger to the
community. This is the case even if he has been released from prison
years ago, she noted.</LD>
<TE>   "What's wrong with warning the public about who may be dangerous?
What is irrational or unconstitutional about that?" responded Justice
Antonin Scalia.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the FBI's "10 Most Wanted" list, asked Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist. Is the government violating the
constitutional rights of these fugitives, he asked, by publicly
branding them as dangerous?</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers challenging the Internet sex registries struggled to
answer the questions posed by Scalia and Rehnquist. And by the end of
the arguments, the justices sounded as though they were resolved to
reject both challenges to Megan's laws.</TE>
<TE>   The measures came in a wave of state laws targeting sex criminals
in the 1990s. Because they were seen as most likely to repeat their
crimes, states rushed to enact measures that went well beyond
ordinary criminal laws.</TE>
<TE>   California and half a dozen other states authorized officials to
lock up "sexual predators" after they had served their prison
sentences. The Supreme Court upheld those laws on a 5-4 vote in 1997,
ruling that this extra confinement was not extra punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The original Megan's Law was named for a 7-year-old New Jersey
girl, Megan Kanka, who was kidnapped and killed in 1994 by a neighbor
who had been convicted twice of sex crimes involving children. Her
parents had known nothing of the neighbor's past.</TE>
<TE>   While all states have a version of Megan's Law, they differ in the
data that are included and how they are made available to the public.</TE>
<TE>   In 21 states, including Connecticut and Alaska, people can check
the state's Web site listing sex offenders by logging onto a
computer. California and other states make listings available at
police stations. State officials also alert communities when
particularly dangerous offenders reside there.</TE>
<TE>   Two broad challenges came before the court Wednesday. In one from
Alaska, several ex-offenders whose crimes occurred before the 1994
law said it is unfair to impose this new registration requirement for
old offenses. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
agreed and ruled that the Alaska law violates the Constitution's ban
on after-the-fact punishments.</TE>
<TE>   In the second case, ex-offenders from Connecticut said it is
unfair to brand them as still dangerous without giving them a
hearing. The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York agreed,
ruling that they are entitled to a hearing before their names and
faces are posted on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's solicitor general, Theodore B. Olson,
Washington attorney John Roberts, who is President Bush's nominee to
the U.S. court of appeals in Washington, and Connecticut Atty. Gen.
Richard Blumenthal led the defense of the state laws.</TE>
<TE>   The state of Alaska is giving its citizens "truthful, objective
information about convicted sex offenders," Roberts said. Registering
with the state and having one's name posted on the Internet "doesn't
rise to the level of punishment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is "demeaning" to be sure, responded Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no escape from it. Nothing will ever get you out of this
demeaning regime," added Ginsburg.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts corrected her by pointing out that less serious offenders
stay on the registry for 10 years. Serious offenders remain on the
Web site for life.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose is not to shame" criminals, as was done in medieval
times, Roberts said. "Here, the purpose is to inform."</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Thompson, a defense lawyer from Anchorage, said
ex-offenders who are married and employed can have their lives ruined
when their names are put on the Internet. "This is stigmatizing. They
are telling the public these people are dangerous now," he said. This
should be seen as extra punishment for past crimes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson disagreed. "This is minimally intrusive. And the people have
decided they want this information," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Could the state require that these ex-offenders have a special
mark on their car license plates? Kennedy asked.</TE>
<TE>   Or how about requiring them to wear badges that would identify
them to the public as sex offenders, asked Justice John Paul Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   Olson said he would find those examples troubling, but they are
far beyond what the states now require, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Connecticut case, several justices said they did not see
how the Internet posting violated any constitutional right.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the constitutional basis for your argument?" Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor asked one lawyer. The ex-offenders had been tried
and convicted, she said, so they had had a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is about avoiding a government-imposed stigma," responded
Shelley Sadin, a defense lawyer from Bridgeport, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist interrupted to ask, "Can truthful information ever be
stigmatizing?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she said, because the posting of an offender's name on the
Internet "sends a message" that he is dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices sounded unpersuaded.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COQUILLE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A jury on Wednesday found the owners and operators of the cargo ship
New Carissa negligent for allowing it to run aground in 1999, and it
awarded Oregon $25 million to remove the last of the wreckage from a
public beach.</LD>
<LD>   The Coos County Circuit Court jury deliberated for fewer than
seven hours over evidence presented in the monthlong trial before
reaching the 10-2 verdict.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an important victory for the state of Oregon," said Tom
Towslee, spokesman for Gov. John Kitzhaber. "It sends a clear
statement that Oregon's beaches belong to Oregon."</LD>
<TE>   The ship's owner, Taiheiyo Kaiun Co. of Japan, is disappointed
with the verdict and has not decided whether to appeal, a spokeswoman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The state argued that the captain of the ship was negligent in
deciding to anchor in a winter storm, rather than staying underway
while waiting for the weather to subside enough for a pilot to take
the ship into port.</TE>

<HD>FTC Suit Targets Six in Deceptive 'Spamming'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday that it had sued six junk
e-mailers who bombarded Internet users with illegal pyramid schemes,
fraudulent loans and e-mail filters that actually attracted more
"spam."</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came as other state and federal law-enforcement
authorities in the Northeast announced actions of their own as part
of a concerted effort to cut down on deceptive spamming and other
illegal behavior on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   "All of us are combining our resources to combat deceptive spam
and Internet scams," Barbara Anthony, regional director for the FTC,
said at a press conference in Boston.</LD>
<TE>   The FTC coordinated similar efforts in the Midwest and Pacific
Northwest earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Although spam is widely regarded as a nuisance, it is not illegal
under U.S. law.</TE>
<TE>   All those facing FTC lawsuits are charged with violating existing
laws against deceptive and unfair trade practices.</TE>
<TE>   One defendant used the logos of such well-known financial
institutions as Prudential and Fannie Mae to collect such personal
information as income and home values from respondents, the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant, whose name was not released, also used false return
addresses so those trying to contact him would not get "no such
recipient" and "do not contact me" messages, the FTC said. As a
result, 30,000 such responses were sent to an innocent Internet user,
the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   Another defendant sent spam for a service that promised to
eliminate spam. In fact, the product sold by NetSource One and its
principal, James R. Haddaway, actually attracted more spam, the FTC
said.</TE>
<TE>   Four others were charged with sending illegal chain letters asking
for money. The defendants agreed to stop the practice or face fines,
the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 100 pyramid-scheme operators received warning
letters from law-enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC also said that investigators had scattered special e-mail
addresses around the Internet to see whether spammers would pick them
up.</TE>
<TE>   E-mail addresses left in news groups and on Web pages were almost
certain to receive spam, investigators found, while those left on
message boards and posted in e-mail directories were somewhat less
likely to. And addresses left in chat rooms were certain to receive
spam.</TE>
<TE>   Although spam has been a nuisance for years, complaints have risen
dramatically as the volume of unwanted commercial pitches has
exploded. Anti-spam firm Brightmail Inc. estimates that spam now
makes up 36% of all e-mail traffic, up from 8% a year ago.</TE>

<HD>Man Held After Threats Against Bush, Police Say</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A man was arrested Wednesday outside the Agriculture Department after
saying he had explosives in a van and making threats against
President Bush, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old Woodbridge, Va., man was taken to George
Washington University Hospital here and held for observation,
District of Columbia Police spokesman Joe Gentile said. Police did
not release the man's name, pending an investigation.</LD>
<LD>   A bomb squad fired a water cannon at two suspicious packages found
in a rental van the man parked outside the department. Neither was
found to contain explosives, police spokesman Quintin Peterson said.</LD>
<TE>   An officer with the Federal Protective Services was first alerted
to the man.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and local police officials were questioning him, and the
Secret Service was looking into whether to charge him with
threatening the president, Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Morning rush-hour traffic was brought to a standstill as several
streets were closed in the area, and about 7,000 people were
evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Officials opened a file box of books in the van and inspected a
suitcase and clothing bags, and the FBI confiscated the truck.</TE>

<HD>Once Seen as Nuisance, Tree Now Will Be Seen at Rockefeller
Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The 76-foot-tall Norway spruce that once irked Mary Rizzo when it
blocked the walkway to her house looked just perfect to her after it
was put up Wednesday as Rockefeller Center's Christmas tree.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-ton tree came from the property of Rizzo and her husband,
Carmine, in Bloomsbury, N.J. In a first for a tradition that began in
1931, the tree was chosen based on a photograph sent in by the
owners.</LD>
<LD>   "We were here last year and looked at the tree and said, 'Gee, our
tree is as nice as that,' " 65-year-old Mary Rizzo said.</LD>
<TE>   "It was time to give it up because it was getting too big and too
near the house," said Carmine Rizzo, 72. "Here, it's nice. I look at
the people looking at it and I'm really tickled pink."</TE>
<TE>   The tree, about 75 years old, was cut down Tuesday. It will be
decorated with 30,000 multicolored lights strung on five miles of
wire. The lighting ceremony is Dec. 4; the tree will be on display
until Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Megan Walsh, 16, of New York comes to Rockefeller Center every
year to watch her father, an ironworker, help hoist the tree into
place.</TE>
<TE>   "This gets you in the mood for the holidays," she said. "This is
the start of the Christmas season for me."</TE>

<HD>6 Get Prison Terms for Roles in '69 York, Pa., Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Six white men were sentenced to prison Wednesday in the shooting
death of a black woman during a 1969 race riot that has haunted the
city for the last 33 years.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants apologized before they were sentenced, but the
victim's daughter complained that none of them had expressed any
sorrow for the slaying of Lillie Belle Allen until they were in
court, where an apology might lessen their punishment.</LD>
<LD>   All six men pleaded guilty in August, and some testified for the
prosecution in the trial earlier this year of York's former mayor and
two other white men. The mayor was acquitted; his co-defendants were
found guilty.</LD>
<TE>   Allen, 27, of Aiken, S.C., was killed amid 10 days of violence
involving blacks and whites in York. During the riots, a white police
officer, Henry Schaad, also was killed, more than 60 people were
injured and 100 people were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Allen was shot to death at twilight after she got out of her
family's car to try to help her panicking sister steer the stalled
vehicle away from a mob of armed white gang members.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Arthur Messersmith was sentenced to 18 months to
three years. He had faced up to nine years in prison for attempted
murder and conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Knouse, William Ritter and Clarence Lutzinger were sentenced
to nine to 23 1/2 months in prison, and Chauncey Gladfelter and Tom
Smith received three to 23 1/2 months in prison. The five, all of
whom pleaded guilty to conspiracy, had faced up to two years behind
bars.</TE>
<TE>   Messersmith, Knouse, Ritter and Lutzinger have admitted shooting
at the car. Smith and Gladfelter admitted serving as lookouts for the
gang members who had gathered in the street.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants and their attorneys sought leniency from Judge John
C. Uhler, saying some of them had been followers of older boys or
policemen who had encouraged them to participate in the violence.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's 44-year-old daughter, Debra Taylor, and other relatives
urged the judge to impose the maximum sentences on the six.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have meant so much if you had just said, 'It was a
terrible thing, a horrific thing. I'm so sorry.' That would have
meant more to me than you doing life in prison," Taylor told
Messersmith.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor also expressed anger at suggestions by defense attorneys
and witnesses that the men shouldn't have been prosecuted for a crime
committed 33 years ago. "If you guys had told the truth way back
when, we wouldn't even be here today," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a jury convicted Messersmith's brother Robert, the
gang leader accused of firing the shot that killed Allen, and Gregory
Neff, who fired several shots at the vehicle, on charges of
second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   The same jury acquitted former Mayor Charlie Robertson, a police
officer at the time of the riots. He was accused of handing out
ammunition and encouraging white gang members to shoot blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Messersmith and Neff could get up to 20 years in prison at
sentencing next month.</TE>

<HD>Molecule Test May Be Heart Disease Detection Key</HD>
<DH>Study finds C-reactive protein appears to be a better
indicator than cholesterol.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testing blood for amounts of a small molecule called C-reactive
protein may be a better predictor of heart disease than the current
method of testing cholesterol, a study of nearly 28,000 women has
found.</LD>
<LD>   The report, published today in the New England Journal of
Medicine, is the largest yet to find such a link and is likely to
influence national guidelines for monitoring heart disease risk,
which are currently under review.</LD>
<LD>   Heart specialists reacted enthusiastically to the study. If an
inexpensive test for the C-reactive protein marker became routine,
they said, it might help identify millions of people whose
cholesterol levels are considered normal but are still at high risk
for heart attacks and strokes. Using both protein and cholesterol
screening could become a potent tool in fighting heart disease.</LD>
<TE>   "If you add the two markers together you get a much better
mousetrap for predicting risk," said Dr. Paul M. Ridker, lead author
of the study and a professor of medicine at Harvard University and a
cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Prior studies had indicated that levels of C-reactive protein
correlates with heart disease risk in men and women, but this study
adds clout because of its large number of subjects.</TE>
<TE>   The study enrolled 27,939 healthy American women aged 45 and
older. At the start of the test, blood levels of LDL cholesterol --
the so-called bad cholesterol -- and C-reactive protein were
obtained. Eight years later, medical records were examined for
incidences of heart attacks and strokes. Medical procedures to clear
blocked blood vessels were also noted.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists found that women with elevated C-reactive protein
levels -- regardless of their cholesterol levels -- were at
heightened risk for heart attack or stroke. The higher the C-reactive
protein, the greater the risk. The risk of a heart attack or stroke
was highest when both cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels were
elevated, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   C-reactive protein is released by the liver and the linings of
blood vessels when they are inflamed. Inflammation is thought to
trigger the plaque on vessel walls to rupture and form clots, which
then block the vessels and trigger a heart attack or stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Different levels of inflammation could help explain why one person
with plaque buildup has a heart attack yet another person with
similar buildup does not.</TE>
<TE>   Ridker estimates that perhaps 25% of the U.S. population have
elevated C-reactive protein levels but have normal cholesterol
levels.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sidney Smith, chief science officer of the American Heart
Assn. and a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina
in Chapel Hill, said, "The test could indicate to people that their
risk is higher than they thought. It could be a very helpful,
motivating factor" for altering their lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists cautioned that it is premature to prescribe drugs such
as statins or aspirin to people with high C-reactive protein levels,
but normal cholesterol. There is no evidence yet that such treatment
would be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of experts from the American Heart Assn. and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention is considering C-reactive protein
screening as a part of heart disease prevention. Its recommendations
are scheduled for release this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can start using C-reactive protein as a
cardiological screening test just like cholesterol," said Dr. Gerald
M. Pohost, chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine at USC's
Keck School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert O. Bonow, president of the American Heart Assn. and
chief of cardiology at Northwestern University Medical School, said
the protein marker findings are exciting, but added that they should
not distract doctors and patients from combating established risk
factors, such as smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "A large number of people have high blood pressure and don't know
it -- or do and aren't being treated," he said. "People are gaining
weight instead of losing weight. We need to continue to focus on
getting the message out about things we know about already."</TE>

<HD>Gentle Giant's Switch to the Majors Crushes Japanese</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Oh no! Now it's goodbye, Godzilla.</LD>
<LD>   Yomiuri Giants' outfielder Hideki "Godzilla" Matsui's all but
certain departure for the major leagues has hit this country where it
hurts.</LD>
<LD>   Bank failures, eroding national confidence and a comatose economy
are bad enough without piling on the loss of Japan's greatest active
baseball player.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, in bolting as a free agent, Matsui, 28, follows in the
footsteps of several other top players. But he's always been in a
different category, the glittering jewel in Japanese baseball's
crown, a near national icon with humility to boot.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier exports played for second-rate teams and were often
mavericks, hardly a compliment in Japan. Matsui, on the other hand,
has been a loyal Yomiuri man in a nation where lifetime employment
with one company still resonates.</TE>
<TE>   And he enjoyed everything Japan had to offer -- wealth, fame and a
top spot on the Yomiuri Giants, the dominant team in Japanese
baseball long used to attracting the best and getting its way. Yet,
Matsui chose another way.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it's a way the gentle giant himself doesn't seem
entirely comfortable with.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent news conference announcing his departure from the
Giants, Matsui was so nervous about letting down his club and fans
that he wrote his talking points in pen on his hands. He apologized
profusely, thanked the media, even called himself a traitor.</TE>
<TE>   It was classic Matsui, a considerate man with a large, pock-marked
face known for making even junior players feel needed, for worrying
about children, devoting extra time to fans, picking up the tab for
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, he will be missed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sad because he's Japan's marquee player and the game here
doesn't hold enough for him," said Akira Hasuoka, 43, a company
manager in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   As for where he is likely to wind up, no surprise there. The New
York Yankees have the left-handed hitting slugger in their sights.
Top guns from the Yankee front office, including President Randy
Levine and General Manager Brian Cashman, are expected to arrive in
Japan today. They will be trying to clinch a multiyear deal that will
reportedly pay Matsui in the neighborhood of $8 million a season.</TE>
<TE>   Given Matsui's personality, however, some worry a coming-out debut
in New York could be a rather rude awakening after the more sheltered
world of Japanese baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki, the American League's most valuable player in 2001,
his rookie season with the Seattle Mariners, is self confident and
someone who has always had his own ideas -- arguably part of why he
fled Japanese baseball and adapted so quickly to the majors. Matsui
is more deliberative and cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern about him playing for the Yankees is that it's such a
crazy place, the fans are out of control and the owner's very loud,"
said Yoshinari Tobe, author of "Hideki Matsui: Monster Legend." "He
usually takes some time to adjust, and I don't think New Yorkers are
patient enough to wait for him."</TE>
<TE>   Speculation on how well he'll do is rife. For Japanese, it's a
point of pride to see their best stack up well in the big show.
During his 10 seasons with the Giants, Matsui had a .304 average, hit
332 home runs, won three most valuable player awards and led his team
four times to the Japan Series.</TE>
<TE>   If he does land in the Bronx, he'll be a bridge between two very
similar teams. Both have been dominating forces in their respective
games, both have won more pennants and national series championships
by far than competitors, both are the richest baseball franchises
around.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the two are each accused of holding a huge, unfair
advantage given the inordinate sums they garner to attract and keep
talent.</TE>
<TE>   A straight comparison vastly underplays the dominance here of the
Yomiuri Giants, however. While the Yankees may be the closest thing
America has to a national team -- if nothing else because so many
Americans love to hate them -- that hardly compares with the 50% of
Japanese fans rooting for the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "The Yomiuri Giants are like the New York Yankees, the L.A.
Lakers, the Green Bay Packers and whoever else you want to throw in
-- combined," said Martin Kuehnert, president of International Sports
Management &amp; Consultants, a marketing firm. "In Japan, it's death,
taxes and the Giants."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants essentially started Japanese professional baseball and
have for 50 years been the only team whose games were all broadcast
on nationwide network television. And they have a huge role in
setting the rules, mostly to the benefit of their own franchise. It
doesn't hurt that their parent company owns the nation's largest
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was the Giants who introduced the free agent system
in Japan several years ago in order to steal away the best players
from other teams. "Now Matsui is using it against the Giants," said
Masayuki Tamaki, an independent sports commentator. "I'm sure they're
thinking, 'Oh no, what have we done?' "</TE>
<TE>   Some believe his departure will serve as a warning for Japanese
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a wake-up call," said Itaru Kobayashi, a sports
columnist. "They haven't had much competition, haven't tried to
entertain fans. When you go to [Edison Field], on the other hand,
there are places for kids to play video games, practice batting, run
around the stadium."</TE>
<TE>   Matsui was born on June 12, 1974 in the small town of Neagari in
northern Japan, the younger of two boys. He showed early promise and
his reputation preceded him in junior high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd heard about this great boy and must say I was very
disappointed when I first saw him," says his former coach, Michihiro
Takakuwa, who now works at the Neagari town office. "He was very
fat."</TE>
<TE>   His mind changed when he saw Matsui's power at the plate, and the
boy was soon whipped into shape.</TE>
<TE>   He was so solidly built, he soon acquired the nickname "sumo
wrestler," which he reportedly hated.</TE>
<TE>   By his last year of junior high school, he was team captain, top
slugger and ace pitcher. He was also getting a big head. "This was
the Matsui team," Takakuwa said. "But I had to hit him several times
to stop him from getting arrogant. There wasn't much already I could
do to improve his technique, so I worked on his character."</TE>
<TE>   Matsui moved on to Seiryo High School, a private academy famous
for its sports program. One day, Takakuwa recalls getting a call from
Matsui's high school coach, whom he knew well, saying he was having
trouble with Matsui.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very worried, and asked what was wrong," recalls Takakuwa.
"His reply: 'My ceiling is leaking because Matsui hit the ball so
hard it broke my roof.' That's when I knew he was doing very well."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants made him their No. 1 draft pick in November 1992,
around the same time he acquired the nickname "Godzilla."</TE>
<TE>   "The name really matches his power and his tough, almost rather
ugly face," said Takakuwa. "But again, I don't think he likes being
called that."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants have made him rich and arguably Japan's best-recognized
sports stars. But experts say some of his competitive ire was raised
by seeing others leave, including some he secretly considered
inferior, while he remained to carry the torch.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Giants offered him an eight-year, $50-million
contract, the most generous ever seen here.After consulting with his
father, however, he held the club off. They tried again the following
year with a similar five-year contract, and again he deferred.</TE>
<TE>   "He was tempted to stay, but the majors had always been his
dream," his father said.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the Giants won the Japan Series earlier this month
-- some say within hours -- he informed the Giants' front office he
wanted out.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui watchers say his urgency was less about outright eagerness
than a reflection of how difficult the decision was for him and his
fears they'd convince him to stay. At the recent news conference,
amid the many apologies he delivered, he let slip that this decision
represented the first time he'd been faithful to himself.</TE>
<TE>   His self-deference, decade of service and well-loved personality
has in the end made it difficult for even the most ardent Japanese
fans to hold it too much against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is his big chance," said Kiyoshi Nakahata, a former
Giants' coach. "I felt so bad he felt like a traitor. We regretted
making him feel that way."</TE>
<TE>   Matsui may have wealth, fame and a new challenge. One thing still
missing for the multimillionaire, however, is any obvious girlfriend,
arguably the cost of being so focused.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish he'd find someone good so she could give him some support
heading into the majors," Tobe said.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui's prospective arrival in the U.S. on the heels of his
compatriots creates an impression there's a vast pool of Japanese
talent waiting to be plucked. In fact, most of the best Japanese
players have now been scouted, experts say, with one or two
exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "They've seen the very top of the line, but that's not reflective
of the other 90%," said International Sports Management's Kuehnert.</TE>
<TE>   "On the [U.S.] side, there's a tendency to say, 'There are 100
more Ichiros running around.' The truth is, there's probably not a
single other Ichiro."</TE>

<HD>Alleged Belmont Rapist Is Charged</HD>
<DH>Long Beach man held in string of attacks faces 64 counts of
burglary and sexual assault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixty-four burglary and sex crime charges were filed Wednesday
against the alleged Belmont Shore serial rapist, who appeared briefly
in a Long Beach courtroom as his bereft mother, who said she prays
for his salvation, sat in the front row.</LD>
<LD>   Alice Rathbun said that her son, Mark Wayne Rathbun, was "ashamed,
embarrassed, remorseful" when she saw him in jail before Wednesday's
hearing, and that he told her, " 'Mom, don't worry, I'll pay for what
I've done,' " Alice Rathbun recalled.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'Then it's true?' He didn't say anything, but his eyes
were red from crying."</LD>
<TE>   Rathbun, 32, was assigned a court-appointed public defender but
did not enter a plea because that attorney was not present. Rathbun's
arraignment was postponed until Wednesday, and a judge ordered him
held at the Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $11-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun, a Long Beach Polytechnic High School graduate and Junior
ROTC member who grew up the only child of a Vietnam War widow, said
little during the afternoon proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   He waived his right to a timely arraignment as he sat in the back
row of the defendant's box, wearing the cream-colored T-shirt with
the letters "ATM" in which he was arrested Sunday night in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Patrol officers on the east side of Long Beach, where a majority
of the 31 attacks attributed to the serial rapist occurred since
1996, stopped Rathbun as he sat on a bike a few blocks from the site
of the last attack early Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun was arrested on suspicion of possessing a crack pipe and
submitted a DNA sample before he posted $250 bail late Friday night
and was released.</TE>
<TE>   But detectives followed his movements, which included two trips to
Oxnard, where he helped a friend move, until DNA test results by the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Crime Lab matched Rathbun's DNA to that
retrieved from a dozen crime scenes of the serial rapist. He was
arrested and returned to Long Beach City Jail.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County district attorney filed a
criminal complaint that charged Rathbun with the 64 counts that
occurred in 14 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The serial predator's spree began with two attacks in 1996 in
Seattle, and Rathbun may be charged there, authorities said
Wednesday. The first attack in Southern California was Jan. 17, 1997,
in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal complaint charged Rathbun with 10 attacks in Long
Beach -- including an attempted assault Nov. 7 -- two in a Los
Alamitos mobile home park five minutes apart and two in Huntington
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   DNA evidence found at 12 of the residences matches Rathbun's, said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Goul. Rathbun is charged with two other
attacks based on other evidence. If convicted of all charges, Rathbun
would spend the rest of his life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Alice Rathbun, 75, a retired cafeteria worker at St.
Mary's Hospital in Long Beach, wore dark glasses, a gold cross and a
denim cap as she arrived at the hearing. She was accompanied by her
sister and a friend who offered moral support in the face of a press
mob that enveloped her before the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Was there anything that she could recall, she was asked, that
might have driven him to attack these women?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the drugs," she said. Her son, she said, smoked
marijuana and used crack cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   She apologized "on behalf of my son" to the women whom he is
accused of raping or assaulting over the years, and said he now has
to "make his goal redemption ... from God."</TE>
<TE>   "I will always love my son," she said. "No matter what. And I told
him that."</TE>
<TE>   She said that she was stunned by the charges, but noted that after
his arrests as a teenager for trespassing, perhaps he did not get the
proper psychological counseling that a priest had urged.</TE>
<TE>   Was there any trauma, she was asked, that might have driven him to
this, such as the death of his father or another male role model?
Alice Rathbun said that her son's father was killed in Vietnam in
1969, before Mark was born, and that another man she might have
married died in a car accident.</TE>
<TE>   "My love affairs," she conceded almost ruefully, "have been
fiascoes."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Mark was "a happy person, a happy child. He was always smiling
as a kid, very friendly," she recalled. Rathbun lived with her and he
took good care of her, she said. Alice Rathbun recalled that they had
watched television news accounts of the serial rapist. "I'd say, 'Oh,
my, look, that's a terrible crime.' He would say, 'Yeah.' "</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents and police, Rathbun has worked over
the years at a variety of mostly low-paying jobs: handyman's helper,
commercial fisherman (what led him to Seattle in the mid-1990s),
supermarket bagger, parking valet and Christmas tree deliveryman.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the jobs offered him the "opportunity" or proximity to the
women or homes, said Long Beach Police Cmdr. Linda Beardslee, who is
heading a task force of agencies investigating the serial sex crimes.
Detectives have yet to determine if the victims were linked.</TE>

<LD>The former owner of the Manhattan Bagel chain pleaded guilty
Wednesday to charges that he defrauded 10 investors, including his
in-laws, out of more than $1.2 million, U.S. prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   The victims thought their money was being used for business
investments.</LD>
<LD>   But Allan Boren used the funds to support "gambling trips to Las
Vegas, Atlantic City and the Bahamas," the U.S. attorney's office
said.</LD>

<HD>Residents Renew Bid to Halt Valley Busway, Calling
Crossings Hazardous</HD>
<DH>MTA says project is safe and construction will begin in the
spring. Group considers suit and awaits ruling on environmental
report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Metropolitan Transportation Authority forges ahead with plans
to build an east-west busway across the San Fernando Valley,
opponents are renewing their push to stop the $330-million project
because of fears that it would disrupt community life and threaten
the safety of pedestrians and motorists.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not against transportation," said Diana Lipari, chairwoman
of Citizens Organized for Smart Transit. "We just think it's a waste
of money and that it's unsafe."</LD>
<LD>   At a neighborhood forum Tuesday night in Van Nuys, Lipari joined
about 30 other area residents in discussing what they see as a flawed
plan to construct the 14-mile bus corridor between the North
Hollywood Red Line subway station and Warner Center in Woodland
Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Lipari said her group is contemplating filing a taxpayers lawsuit
against the MTA to halt the busway. The group earlier went to court
to challenge the adequacy of the project's environmental report. A
judge is expected to make a ruling next month.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated MTA officials said this is a last-ditch attempt to
scuttle a project that is funded and ready to begin construction in
the spring, with completion set for 2005.</TE>
<TE>   They said the agency would not support a project that is unsafe,
and accused busway opponents of engaging in "scare tactics."</TE>
<TE>   "We have debated ad nauseam over how to serve that corridor," said
Marc Littman, an MTA spokesman. "You reach a point when you've got to
move forward."</TE>
<TE>   To clear the way for construction, the MTA is negotiating to buy
seven parcels of property along the proposed route on Victory
Boulevard, Oxnard Street and Chandler Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the agency has sent out 101 lease-termination
notices to businesses along the designated corridor, said Velma
Marshall, real estate director for the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the leases are on MTA-owned land that is being used for
parking or storage, Marshall said. The MTA is providing relocation
assistance to tenants who were there before the agency bought the
land, a defunct rail corridor, from Union Pacific in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency's helping hand hasn't stemmed the anger and
frustration among businesses that are being forced to relocate.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in operation for 50 years on the same corner, and all
of a sudden they shut you down," said Mark Ernsberger, general
manager of Terry Lumber in Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   Losing their parking spaces are a sewing factory and a Jewish
community center that provides day care for children.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, busway opponents argued that the transit
corridor and its numerous street-level crossings, some of which would
traverse neighborhoods and intersections at odd angles, will create
traffic hazards.</TE>
<TE>   They also contend that the busway would not save riders much time,
compared to a similar ride in a less-expensive Metro Rapid bus on a
regular city street. The busway's sound walls would become tableaux
for graffiti vandals, and late at night the empty corridor could draw
drag racers, Lipari said.</TE>
<TE>   Kymberleigh Richards, a spokeswoman for Southern California
Transit Advocates, said the MTA should reconsider putting a
light-rail line in the corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, the agency abandoned plans for building a subway
because of community opposition and a lack of funding. A plan for
light rail also broke down.</TE>
<TE>   "It is never too late for an agency to backtrack," Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   But Nate Zablen, a Sherman Oaks resident, said he's tired of the
years of inaction. "Every area in L.A. is getting something. Pasadena
is getting a [light-rail] line. The Eastside is getting a line,"
Zablen said. "The Valley needs transit, and a transit way is the best
way to go."</TE>

<HD>Traffic Cameras Spur Conflict Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Cities that give firms part of each citation have run into
trouble in court. San Juan Capistrano is among those weighing flat
rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities are considering changes in the way private operators of
red-light cameras in San Juan Capistrano are paid, amid criticism
that the current system encourages officials to hand out as many
traffic tickets as possible.</LD>
<LD>   Joining a growing number of agencies across the country, the city
has proposed that the operator receive a flat monthly rate for
running the system rather than getting a percentage of each ticket.</LD>
<LD>   The current system "may cause some to believe [officials] are less
objective in determining whether a citation should be issued," Orange
County Sheriff's Lt. J.B. Davis said in a memo to city officials.</LD>
<TE>   "If this were the interpretation one desired to adopt, it could be
argued that the [city's] objectivity in determining the validity of a
violation ... could be tainted," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano is one of dozens of cities that have installed
cameras at busy intersections to catch drivers who run red lights.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras are linked to pavement sensors and synchronized with
the traffic signals to snap pictures after the light turns red.</TE>
<TE>   But nearly everywhere the cameras have been installed, critics
have complained that they violate driver privacy and amount to
profit-making enterprises for cities as well as the companies that
operate the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   A state audit released this year found that the cameras reduce
accidents, but that oversight of the programs is lax and cities that
use the cameras are vulnerable to lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism has prompted some cities to stop paying companies
for each ticket. San Diego switched to the flat-rate system after
losing a court battle over the cameras. Attorneys representing 292
drivers argued that giving a contractor $70 of each $271 fine
collected was incentive for the company to "prosecute for profit."
Superior Court Judge Ronald Styn agreed.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano, which has cameras at three intersections,
pays RedFlex Inc. up to $59 per ticket. The proposed change would pay
the Culver City firm $9,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   A staff report said the change should not affect the city
financially. Councilman Wyatt T. Hart said he believes the system is
honest but understands the perception of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "By doing flat-fee, that would eliminate that perception," Hart
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to look at the [program] to see what it's accomplishing
.... I think it's working OK, but I don't know if San Juan is large
enough to have the Big Brother concept," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it can be shown that it reduces accidents and injuries and
makes the streets safer for the citizens of San Juan Capistrano, then
I'll support it."</TE>

<HD>Red-Light Cameras Spur Bias Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Drivers say giving firms part of fine is improper. San Juan
Capistrano weighs flat rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Authorities are considering changes in the way private operators of
red-light cameras in San Juan Capistrano are paid, amid criticism
that the current system encourages officials to hand out as many
traffic tickets as possible.</LD>
<LD>   Joining a growing number of agencies across the country, the city
has proposed that the operator receive a flat monthly rate for
running the system rather than getting a percentage of each ticket
fine.</LD>
<LD>   The current system "may cause some to believe [officials] are less
objective in determining whether a citation should be issued," Orange
County Sheriff's Lt. J.B. Davis said in a memo to city officials.</LD>
<TE>   "If this were the interpretation one desired to adopt, it could be
argued that the [city's] objectivity in determining the validity of a
violation ... could be tainted," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano is one of dozens of cities that have installed
cameras at busy intersections to catch drivers who run red lights.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras are linked to pavement sensors and synchronized with
the traffic signals to snap pictures after the light turns red.</TE>
<TE>   But nearly everywhere the cameras have been installed, critics
have said that they violate driver privacy and amount to
profit-making enterprises for cities as well as the companies that
operate the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   A state audit released this year found that the cameras reduce
accidents, but that oversight of the programs is lax and cities that
use the cameras are vulnerable to lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism has prompted some cities to stop paying companies
for each ticket. San Diego switched to the flat-rate system after
losing a court battle over the cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing 292 drivers argued that giving a contractor
$70 of each $271 fine collected was incentive for the company to
"prosecute for profit." Superior Court Judge Ronald Styn agreed.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano, which has cameras at three intersections,
pays RedFlex Inc. up to $59 per ticket. The proposed change would pay
the Culver City firm $9,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   A staff report said the change should not affect the city
financially.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Wyatt T. Hart said he thinks the system is honest but
understands the perception of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "By doing flat-fee, that would eliminate that perception," Hart
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hart wants the council's review not to be limited to the payment
method, but thinks it should also examine whether the whole system
needs an overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to look at the [program] to see what it's accomplishing
.... I think it's working OK, but I don't know if San Juan is large
enough to have the Big Brother concept," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it can be shown that it reduces accidents and injuries and
makes the streets safer for the citizens of San Juan Capistrano, then
I'll support it."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Mudslinging May Stain Fellow Democrats in Elections
to Come</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>Sacramento</DL>
<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   Sure, they bucked a national Republican tide. But in their
winning, California Democrats also may have sown the seeds for future
defeat.</LD>
<LD>   By Democrats, I mean basically Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<TE>   Davis won't be running for governor again, although he could seek
a U.S. Senate seat. Regardless, any future Democratic candidate in
California -- including the party's 2004 presidential nominee --
could be handicapped by Davis' attack ads this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The governor was the No. 1 aggression-hawk in his campaign,
sources say. During hot-tempered strategy sessions late in the
contest, Davis insisted on bombarding Bill Simon Jr. relentlessly
with TV attacks. Bludgeoning Simon would depress the Republican
nominee's vote and prevent him from reviving his damaged candidacy,
Davis figured.</TE>
<TE>   What Davis did not figure -- despite advisors' loud warnings --
was that the negative ads also would depress his own vote. The spots
drove away potential voters who lean Democrat. And nobody can be sure
where they'll be leaning when they return. Maybe Republican.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem going at an opponent with a ball-peen
hammer," says Garry South, Davis' chief strategist. "But at some
point you have to give your people a reason to get off their butts on
election day and go vote for you. We didn't give them enough reason.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a factor in the pathetically low turnout."</TE>
<TE>   Other factors, South says, were:</TE>
<TE>   * "A popular Republican president who campaigned [nationally] like
there was no tomorrow. We had no one to counter. That was a bit
demoralizing to Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   * "We were hoisted by our own petard" with legislative
redistricting. Both parties united behind an incumbents-protection
plan that failed to generate voter interest.</TE>
<TE>   * "No galvanizing ballot measures."</TE>
<TE>   But clearly, the most demoralizing and least interesting aspect of
the election for many Californians was their choice for governor.
They considered Davis corrupt and calculating, Simon ignorant and
inept. And both candidates aggravated the public's sour mood with
barrages of attack ads.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had lost all confidence in his ability to sell himself on
TV; people just wouldn't believe him. Simon's strategists also didn't
think their guy was credible.</TE>
<TE>   When all the votes are counted, the turnout is expected to be
around 50%, a record low. Davis probably will win by a mere five
points, roughly 47% to 42%, compared to nearly 20 points in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The voter boycott seems to have particularly hurt Davis and
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Many moderates -- the very group this centrist governor courted
throughout his first term -- simply did not vote, according to The
Times' exit poll. Neither did many Latinos, despite their soaring
population. In '98, both groups turned out bigger for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   When the disgusted voters do return, will they again be siding
with Democrats? Or will they be more open to a Republican, like
President Bush in 2004?</TE>
<TE>   Bush lost here by 12 points in 2000. But the Nov. 5 results have
revived GOP hopes in a state that Democrats must win to recapture the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   "After this election, I believe Bush could carry the state,"
insists Tony Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn -- a veteran political analyst, numbers junkie and onetime
GOP aide -- called me to exclaim a Republican "glass half full"
assessment of the election results, based on The Times' exit poll and
actual returns.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, somebody else could look at the same numbers and see a
"glass half empty." If the GOP couldn't oust an unpopular governor in
an election with such favorable demographics, its future must be
hopeless.</TE>
<TE>   Dissecting the numbers, Quinn notes that:</TE>
<TE>   * Moderates -- the swing voters -- constituted only 30% of the
electorate, compared to 43% in 1998. As a group, they voted 16 points
less for Davis this time.</TE>
<TE>   "Moderates are people who don't have strong ideological views and
are less motivated to vote," Quinn says. "They were just totally
turned off."</TE>
<TE>   * Whites constituted 76% of the vote, up from 64% in 1998. They
gave Simon a slight edge. Latinos amounted to only 10% of the
electorate, down from 13%. Those who did vote sided with Davis by 41
points.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't more Latinos vote? "Why should they?" replies Antonio
Gonzalez, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute, a Latino
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "They were terrible campaigns.... When all you hear is 'vote
against,' it turns off the occasional voters, who are the bread and
butter of the Latino electorate. Unlike whites, we don't have this
class of chronic voters. I'm concerned that this election could have
created a plateau in the expansion of Latino participation."</TE>
<TE>   So Davis and Democrats did win. But the governor may have made it
easier for Republicans to win next time.</TE>

<HD>Joint Effort Will Target Cargo Thieves</HD>
<DH>A partnership of several agencies is set up to increase
security at ports and across the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal, state and local law enforcement authorities on Wednesday
announced the creation of a multi-agency partnership to be based at
the Port of Los Angeles that will attack the mushrooming problem of
cargo theft.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be a very strong effort," said California Highway
Patrol Chief Mike Brown, whose agency will assign a dozen people to
the new service's location, a warehouse donated by the Port of Los
Angeles. "This will be a great step in the right direction to stem
the tide of cargo theft in the ports and across the state."</LD>
<LD>   Among the agencies expected to assign security specialists to the
renovated 20,000-square-foot Wilmington facility are the CHP's Cargo
Theft Interdiction Program, the FBI, U.S. Customs, U.S. Coast Guard,
and the state Department of Insurance.</LD>
<TE>   Other agencies include Los Angeles International Airport, the Los
Angeles Police Department, the Port Police Department and the Vernon
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Cargo thieves in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and
Ventura counties steal about $2 million worth of goods each day,
authorities estimate. California, the nation's capital for cargo
theft, loses about $600 million in cargo a year.</TE>
<TE>   Operating under the same roof will be the Los Angeles County
sheriff's anti-cargo theft unit, which was eliminated by Sheriff Lee
Baca in July to cut costs but is being revived with $800,000 in
donations from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Los Angeles
County and private industry.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-theft unit, which will resume with a nine-member team,
was initially invited to merge with the CHP program, but chose to
operate on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our intent to expand [the unit] by another five
investigators over the next year, if funds become available," said
Sheriff's Capt. Robert Malone.</TE>
<TE>   "Private industry has said [the unit] is extremely important. They
fought hard to bring it back," Malone said.</TE>
<TE>   The exact number of cargo thefts is unknown, however, given that
there is no standard reporting system for such crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters, to avert premium increases, trucking
companies often do not file cargo theft-related claims.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the partnership will also investigate possible
smuggling and terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a port security
bulletin that said that recent security probes of Los Angeles and
Long Beach ports discovered downed fences as well as open and
unguarded gates. Identification checks were haphazard.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a Coast Guard special agent working undercover was
allowed to walk past guards unchallenged, enter a facility, board a
vessel and roam freely.</TE>
<TE>   "If repeated shortfalls are noted and the level of security at a
facility is deemed inappropriate," Coast Guard Capt. J.M. Holmes
warned, "it may be necessary to prohibit vessels from mooring at a
facility until the level of security at the facility is determined to
be adequate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an action I would prefer not to take," he said.
"Unfortunately, in this environment, the security of an individual
facility may place the entire port complex in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex -- the nation's
third-largest -- each year handles more than 5 million shipping
containers, with cargo valued in excess of $170 billion.</TE>

<LD>A 19-year-old Pacoima man was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison
Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a Kennedy High School student last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Manuel Celis was convicted in July of second-degree murder
for his role in the Sept. 13, 2001, killing of Ricky Loyd, 16, as he
crouched behind a concrete wall seeking safety.</LD>
<LD>   Celis could have been sentenced to 40 years to life in prison but
received a reduced sentence after helping authorities prosecute his
co-defendant, Hector Ramirez, 17, the alleged shooter.</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez, who pleaded no contest to second-degree murder last
month, is scheduled to be sentenced Friday in San Fernando. He faces
35 years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Celis drove a rented car to the Granada Hills high
school and stopped while Ramirez ran from the vehicle and shot Loyd
in the head, then kicked him a few times as he lay dying.</TE>
<TE>   Celis and Ramirez flashed gang signs as they were leaving the
crime scene, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Warren G. Greene called
Loyd's death "senseless."</TE>
<TE>   "While Mr. Celis was not the person who shot Mr. Loyd, he was an
active participant in it," Greene said. "It's not as though Mr. Celis
could have been very surprised by what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Maricela Vaiz, 16, cried as she told the court how much
she misses her cousin and wants to keep his memory alive.</TE>
<TE>   "Ricky will always be remembered as a good example of a cousin and
a friend who would always be there," Maricela said.</TE>

<HD>Police Chief Pledges a New War on Gangs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Speaking at a special City Council meeting Wednesday night in Sylmar,
Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton assured residents that
his department would launch an all-out war on street gangs.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton praised a recent initiative by the LAPD and local
political leaders to work more closely with community youth and
religious organizations to help curb the gang problem.</LD>
<LD>   "It's partnership that is the cornerstone of community policing,"
he told a crowd of several hundred at Mission College. "No city needs
that partnership more than this city."</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department estimates there are 80 gangs
with 20,000 members in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Gang violence -- including murder, rape, robbery and assault --
jumped 7.1% in the Valley in 2001, according to the LAPD.
Gang-related homicides increased from 38 to 46 over the 12 months
ending in September, but overall gang violence was down 1.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the Police Department has used specialized units
and court injunctions to combat gangs. More recently, it has teamed
up with probation and corrections officers and prosecutors in an
anti-gang program, Community Law Enforcement and Recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The program was instituted in 1997 under a $3-million state grant
in the Valley's Devonshire and Foothill divisions. But this year, the
budget was slashed to $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on KFWB-AM (980) Wednesday, Bratton said the Special
Enforcement Unit that replaced the anti-gang CRASH units after the
1999 Rampart scandal has been less effective at penetrating street
gangs. But he stopped short of saying he would bring back CRASH
(Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums), noting allegations by
former Officer Rafael Perez that the unit's officers regularly
falsified evidence and even sold drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's Sylmar appearance came a day after swearing-in
ceremonies for his new command staff, including Assistant Chief Jim
McDonnell and Deputy Chiefs Sharon Papa and George Gascon.</TE>
<TE>   Since being named chief, Bratton has said a more effective way to
attack gangs is to let division captains operate more like department
chiefs to quickly deploy officers where they are needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the captain, much the same as I'm going to do as chief, to
be able to say 'I need 30 people in a gang unit because I have a
horrendous gang problem,' " Bratton said in an earlier interview. "I
don't want him to have to send up a report through the chain of
command."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Officers Sentenced for Beating</HD>
<DH>Judge recommends they serve one-year terms in work furlough
for the attack on homeless man.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former Los Angeles police officers who assaulted a homeless man
and then let two colleagues take the blame for the crime received
one-year sentences Wednesday from a judge who recommended that they
be placed in a work furlough program instead of jail.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler called the
actions of Christopher Coppock and David Cochrane "felony stupid" and
their crime "serious."</LD>
<LD>   But Fidler also said he would not object if the ex-officers were
allowed to serve their sentences at their homes under electronic
monitoring.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the county Probation Department, which screens
candidates for work furlough and electronic monitoring, said people
convicted of violent crimes normally do not qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Fidler also ordered each officer to pay the victim, Delton Bowen,
$5,000, and to serve five years' probation, which is two years longer
than the normal probationary period for the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Cochrane, 36, and Coppock, 30, were convicted of terrorizing Bowen
on Oct. 23, 1997, by forcing the homeless man into their squad car
and taking him to a tunnel leading to the Los Angeles River, throwing
him on the ground and threatening him with a handgun. Both were
indicted on charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment and assault
under color of authority.</TE>
<TE>   The sentencing Wednesday came after the prosecutor, Deputy Dist.
Atty. Kraig St. Pierre, apologized to the judge and publicly
retracted comments he made in a Times story about the case in August.
In that story, St. Pierre said Fidler had indicated "this is not a
state prison case," and had "circumscribed our role" in determining
the sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Fidler accepted St. Pierre's apology. He then offered to withdraw
from the case, but St. Pierre and the officers' attorneys said they
wanted him to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, Coppock and Cochrane pleaded no contest to
assault. Prosecutors agreed to a sentence of no more than a year in
jail, and dismissed the kidnapping and false imprisonment charges.
Without the plea arrangement, Cochrane could have faced up to 18
years in prison and Coppock a maximum of nine years, if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen had been taken into custody for causing a disturbance by
other officers from West Los Angeles, who took him to a homeless
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Cochrane and Coppock drove to the shelter with Officer
Sandra Salazar, a rookie who had just completed her probationary
period, riding with them. St. Pierre said Bowen, who was intoxicated,
made derogatory comments to Cochrane and Coppock and an argument
ensued, ending when the officers put him in their car and drove him
to the tunnel, where the assault occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The two officers who took Bowen to the homeless shelter were later
accused of the assault. They were exonerated at a police disciplinary
hearing, where Salazar testified on their behalf. Coppock later
resigned and Cochrane was fired. St. Pierre said Cochrane and Coppock
"lied through their teeth" at the disciplinary hearing when they
testified under oath against the other officers.</TE>
<TE>   St. Pierre argued Wednesday for the maximum possible sentence
under the plea agreement, contending that the defendants had
terrorized Bowen, failed to show contrition for their actions and
conspired to let the two West Los Angeles officers take the blame.</TE>
<TE>   "They picked on the least among us, the poorest of the poor," he
said. "Imagine the terror of that man and how he must have felt being
treated the way he was."</TE>
<TE>   St. Pierre also argued that the misdeed forced the district
attorney's office to drop criminal charges in 11 cases in which
Cochrane and Coppock were the principal witnesses, because their
credibility was tainted.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, St. Pierre urged Fidler not to feel bound by the
one-year maximum sentence under the plea bargain, contending that
Coppock and Cochrane had refused to take responsibility for their
acts. Judges have the authority to reject the terms of plea
agreements. St. Pierre did not ask for a specific prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Levine, Cochrane's lawyer, and Robert Rico, who represents
Coppock, argued that their clients' no-contest pleas showed they have
accepted responsibility. The attorneys said their clients had
suffered more than Bowen, because their careers as police officers
are over.</TE>
<TE>   Levine, Rico and St. Pierre said in interviews later that they
were pleased with Fidler's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The judge allowed both defendants to remain free on their own
recognizance and ordered them to return to court Dec. 13, when he
will hear from probation or Sheriff's Department officials on whether
the officers will be jailed, placed on work furlough or be
electronically monitored.</TE>

<HD>City Council Briefs Valley Residents on Improving Services</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Convening in the San Fernando Valley for the first time since the
defeat of secession, the Los Angeles City Council advanced plans
Wednesday to improve city services.</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting at Mission College in Sylmar, the council also
provided the more than 250 residents who attended with briefings from
city department heads on efforts to improve basic city services to
the Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Council President Alex Padilla directly addressed those in the
audience who believe the Valley has not received its fair share of
services. "We are going to need to focus on the equity of providing
city services throughout Los Angeles," Padilla said.</LD>
<TE>   Secession activist James Stewart said he was appalled by the
conditions of streets in the northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "This area of the Valley has been lacking in these services," he
told the council.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the council was talking of reform and improved
services, secession backers met Wednesday to plan ways to keep
pressure on the city to carry out real change.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), who received the most
votes for mayor of the proposed Valley city, met Wednesday with many
of the 14 top vote-getters who ran for seats on a city council that
would have existed had cityhood been approved by voters Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Richman denied the group was forming a "shadow government," saying
instead the former candidates are creating a nonprofit organization
to advocate for the Valley getting better service from the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an organization to keep pressure on the city of Los
Angeles to move forward," Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   The council met until late into the evening and was expected to
move forward with a study of a new committee structure in which
council members in geographic clusters would meet periodically in the
areas they serve.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about being effective," said Councilman Tom LaBonge, who
introduced a motion to create the new committees. "Anytime you get
closer to the people and engage them in conversation you provide a
better opportunity to solve problems."</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, there would be one committee for each of the
seven areas covered by a regional planning commission. Some council
members would serve on more than one committee if their districts
straddled two regions.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the council members of the 2nd, 6th, 7th and 12th
districts would form a north Valley regional committee, which would
hold night meetings in that area on north Valley issues.</TE>
<TE>   The council members of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 12th
districts would form a south Valley regional committee.</TE>
<TE>   Other committees would be formed for the Westside, Central,
Eastside, South City and harbor areas.</TE>
<TE>   The council action came a day after Mayor James K. Hahn proposed
dividing the city into seven neighborhood service areas, each with
its own city hall and cabinet of administrators from departments
providing community services. The boundaries of the service areas and
the regions served by the council committee would be the same.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, in whose district Wednesday's meeting was held, arranged
to have city department heads brief the public at the meeting on how
they are improving basic services in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The city increased the amount of street resurfacing from 150 miles
in 1996 to 260 miles this year, and officials hope to increase it to
300 miles in the near future, according to William A. Robertson,
director of the city Bureau of Street Resurfacing.</TE>

<HD>Pacoima Plane Crash Injures 3</HD>
<DH>Pilot, passenger and the driver of a car are hurt. Newly
repaired Cessna was on a test flight.</DH>

<LD>The pilot of a small plane was injured Wednesday afternoon when his
Cessna Centurion hit a moving car and then smashed into a used car
lot a few blocks from the runway where he was trying to land at
Whiteman Airport in Pacoima.</LD>
<LD>   A passenger in the plane and a man driving a Honda Civic received
minor injuries in the crash, which occurred about 3:30 p.m. near San
Fernando Road and Pinney Street.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the plane came down beside railroad tracks on a
dirt shoulder along San Fernando Road, then skidded across the road,
hitting the car before coming to a stop in the car lot.</LD>
<TE>   The pilot, Ruben Piranian, 56, of Granada Hills, owns Burbank Air
Service, a repair shop at Whiteman, said friend and attorney Ernest
J. Franceschi Jr. Piranian had just repaired the plane for a customer
and had taken it for a test flight when the engine failed, Franceschi
said.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters arrived moments after the call came in to Fire
Station 98, five blocks north of the crash site, which was near the
airport, said Bob Collis of the Los Angeles Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   "They just about made it," Collis said, "but they didn't."</TE>
<TE>   A small fire caused by leaking fuel was quickly extinguished,
Collis said.</TE>
<TE>   Piranian was taken to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The passenger, whom friends identified as Nicolas Estrella, 26,
and the 28-year-old Honda driver, whose identity was unknown, were
taken to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at both hospitals declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Franceschi said he visited Piranian in the hospital, where he
appeared to be recuperating quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems to be in good shape. He is in shock. And we are trying
to determine what happened," Franceschi said. He added, "There is an
old aviation saying that any landing you can walk away from is a good
landing."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Dillinger, a retired Los Angeles Police Department officer,
was sitting in his office at Black &amp; White Towing next to the car lot
when the plane went down.</TE>
<TE>   "I went over to the plane and dragged the pilot out," Dillinger
said. "He [the pilot] didn't speak. He was bleeding quite a bit from
the head and nose."</TE>
<TE>   Norm Rogers, a pilot at Whiteman who has known Piranian for years,
said he visited him in the hospital shortly after the crash and he
appeared to be in good condition.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little confused right now, but he's going to be all
right," Rogers said. "That's the most important thing."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration were at the
crash scene Wednesday evening.</TE>

<HD>Cal State Seeing Faster Graduation Pace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite campuses jammed by rising enrollments, students are
graduating at faster rates in the California State University system,
a report released Wednesday shows.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State officials attributed the improvement largely to
increased spending on education amid the state's economic recovery in
the late 1990s, a change that they say brought undergraduate students
a greater choice of classes and more counseling help.</LD>
<LD>   According to the report, 42% of freshmen who began in the fall of
1995 earned bachelor's degrees within six years. That was up from 39%
for the group of freshmen who entered Cal State universities in fall
1993.</LD>
<TE>   For students who transferred to Cal State schools from community
colleges, the latest figures show the percentage who earned
bachelor's degrees within three years was 51%, up from 48% among
transfers who began studies at Cal State campuses three years
earlier, in fall 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The higher graduation rates raised hopes among officials in the
23-campus system that further gains will be produced by stepped-up
efforts over the last few years to relieve crowding by cutting the
time it takes for students to earn bachelor's degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that when we talk three or four years from now, we'll see
an even greater increase in students graduating in six years, or
maybe even five years," said David S. Spence, the Cal State system's
executive vice chancellor and chief academic officer.</TE>
<TE>   He delivered the report at the Cal State board of trustees meeting
in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Travis J. Reindl, director of state policy analysis for the
American Assn. of State Colleges and Universities, cited federal
statistics showing that the six-year graduation rate nationally at
universities comparable to Cal State campuses was 38.1% for students
who enroll as freshmen. The graduation rate for such students at all
public universities nationally is 41.4%.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of state university systems have put a lot of emphasis on
programs for at-risk students, and CSU has been particularly active,"
Reindl said.</TE>
<TE>   Spence said graduation rates at many Cal State campuses are held
down by the high percentage of commuter students who study part time
and who have to balance their education with long hours at work off
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even among full-time students, the latest figures show that
only 30% graduated in the traditional four-year time period.</TE>
<TE>   "That still raises questions," Spence said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cal State system's accountability report, a follow-up to a
similar performance assessment issued in September 2000, partly
focused on the system's efforts to cope with surging enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, it found that the percentage of instruction provided
at nontraditional times, through online education or at off-campus
centers rose to 40% in the 2000-01 school year. That was up from 38%
in 1998-99. Included in the nontraditional category of instruction
were classes taught during summer sessions, evenings and weekends.
The figure is expected to rise in coming years as a result of a
recent expansion in summer school offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment throughout the system, now at a record 407,000, is
expected to grow by the equivalent of 11,000 to 12,000 full-time
students a year throughout the coming decade.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Cal State Board of Trustees is expected to approve
a resolution for some of the system's campuses to begin studying
expansion plans to accommodate rising enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   The report also showed the beginnings of the admissions squeeze
due to the boom in young people reaching college age in California.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 10,819 students in the 2000-01 school year who met the
basic standards for admission -- meaning that they finished in the
top third of their graduating class and completed the necessary
college preparatory courses -- were turned away from their
first-choice campuses for lack of room.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rejections came from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and San
Diego State. Of those rejected students, 7,695 were admitted to other
Cal State campuses.</TE>

<LD>A 16-year-old boy pleaded not guilty Wednesday to first-degree
murder, burglary and robbery charges in connection with the fatal
beating of a Santa Paula couple in their home last month.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Sarabia, a continuation school student who lives a few blocks
from the slain couple's home, stood behind a courtroom partition and
peered at a small crowd gathered for his arraignment in Ventura
County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Jay Johnson entered the plea on Sarabia's behalf and
denied three special-circumstance allegations that the boy committed
multiple killings during a robbery and burglary.</LD>
<TE>   Under state law, those allegations require the district attorney
to try Sarabia as an adult rather than a juvenile, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia, who remains held in a juvenile facility, was ordered to
return to court Jan. 15 for a preliminary hearing. If the case goes
to trial and the boy is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of
life in prison without possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia is accused of entering the upscale home of John Ramirez
Jr., 59, and Joann Wotkyns, 55, on Oct. 21 and killing the couple
with a baseball bat and a knife as they lay in bed.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend the motive was burglary. Sarabia allegedly
took some possessions from the home and went joy-riding in the
couple's Special Edition 2001 Chevy Monte Carlo after the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Sarabia's lawyer declined to comment on the charges,
saying he has not received investigative reports from the district
attorney's office.</TE>

<HD>HBO Loses Bid for Emmys</HD>
<DH>TV Academy bows to boycott threat, rejects higher offer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a boycott threat that could have seriously damaged the
organization, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences approved a
new eight-year deal with the four major networks Wednesday night that
will allow them to continue carrying the Emmy Awards -- rejecting a
more lucrative bid from pay TV service Home Box Office.</LD>
<LD>   Industry sources say that ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox agreed to a deal
worth $52 million, in which they will take turns televising the Emmys
through 2010, as they have since 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, the networks will pay $5.5 million per year
during the first four years, sources said, escalating to $7.5 million
in the fifth year.</LD>
<TE>   That represents a sizable increase over the $3 million the
networks had been paying, but considerably less than the $10-million
bid by HBO, which had met the academy's asking price.</TE>
<TE>   CBS Television President Leslie Moonves presented the four
networks' counterproposal to the academy's executive committee
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   With the networks threatening to withdraw all support from the
Emmys -- and perhaps launch a competing awards show -- if the
nonprofit organization opted for the exclusive HBO deal, insiders
said the academy was happy to maintain the status quo while still
securing a sizable raise to fund its programs.</TE>
<TE>   Academy President Todd Leavitt said the deal, ratified by the
group's board of governors in North Hollywood, was "in the best
interests of the industry."</TE>
<TE>   HBO's bid, revealed Monday, stunned ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. The
academy has for years maintained that it deserves more of the profits
the networks reap from the Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   The Emmys, however, rely on the networks' participation and
goodwill. For that reason, flirting with a single-network deal risks
retaliation from the left-out broadcasters that some felt could
significantly undermine the organization's future.</TE>

<HD>Tollway Plan Hits a Bump</HD>
<DH>A U.S. Senate panel kills a bid to exempt Foothill South
Extension from state law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. Senate committee has scuttled efforts to exempt from state law
a controversial proposed toll road in south Orange County that could
cross parts of Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and San Onofre State
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) announced Wednesday that the Armed
Services Committee recently removed wording from a military
authorization bill that would have benefited the Foothill South
Extension.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Corridor Agencies, which operate 51 miles of
tollways in Orange County, plan to build the 16.5-mile extension from
Mission Viejo to Interstate 5. A variety of proposals are under
study, although the preferred alternative goes through Camp Pendleton
and San Onofre State Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Had the wording sought by the corridor agency remained, state law
could not block the U.S. Navy from granting the toll road an easement
through Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   The highway also would be exempt from state environmental, public
health and water quality laws as well as from any future legislation
to restrict roads through state parks, such as San Onofre, which is
on leased federal property.</TE>
<TE>   "It was special-favor legislation for a toll road that needs to be
judged on its own merits," said Bill Corcoran, a regional
representative for the Sierra Club, which opposes the tollway
project.</TE>
<TE>   The bill containing the exemptions was passed by the House. When
it reached the Senate Armed Services Committee, Boxer and Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) expressed opposition.</TE>
<TE>   They noted the highway's potential effects on San Onofre and on
some of the last remaining areas of open space in Southern
California, which include habitat for endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "We can think of no compelling federal interest that justifies
eroding California's ability to fully review the economic, social and
environmental impacts of a project of this scope," Boxer and
Feinstein told committee members.</TE>
<TE>   They pointed out that Gen. J.L. Jones, the Marine Corps
commandant, has expressed reservations to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency about the Foothill South. Jones has not liked the
idea of a major road being built on or near Camp Pendleton because it
could interfere with military readiness and natural areas on the
base. But, he said, the Corps will honor a 1988 commitment to allow
one highway through the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Clare Climaco, a spokeswoman for the corridor agencies, said toll
agency officials are disappointed that the exemptions were pulled
from the bill. She said a route now under study would have to be
eliminated if legislation is passed to halt highways through state
parks.</TE>

<HD>State Praises Turnaround at School</HD>
<DH>New leadership is cited in success of L.A.'s Fremont High,
listed as one of the state's worst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State auditors are crediting new leadership at John C. Fremont High
School for stunning improvements in classroom instruction and student
behavior less than a year after they declared the campus to be
hopelessly disarrayed.</LD>
<LD>   A report by the state superintendent of public instruction's
office released this week called the progress at the South Los
Angeles a transformation.</LD>
<LD>   "It was as if the monitoring team was on a different school
campus," the auditors wrote, summarizing an October inspection of the
school that was placed under state review last year because of
chronically low test scores.</LD>
<TE>   The report said Fremont was progressing on almost every front
specified in an intervention agreement between the state and the Los
Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   The 4,600-student high school, which was profiled in a July
article in The Times, is one of 13 schools in California -- 10 of
them in Los Angeles -- singled out for a state audit over poor
academic performance. Each has 18 months to improve or face sanctions
that include a state takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Jackson, who leads the audit team at Fremont, said the
final judgment on Fremont's progress will be based on test scores
next spring and the year after. But he said the changes he has seen
since his visit in June show how quickly a poor-performing school can
turn the corner. He said most of the improvements came after the
appointment of a new principal, LaVerne Brunt, in August.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that on the whole, I think it's a little bit on the
phenomenal side," Jackson said. "I can't imagine anyone saying the
school is where it needs to be and they're comfortable, but the goal
seems far more attainable now than it did before."</TE>
<TE>   In last spring's state standardized testing, Fremont's students
ranked in the bottom 10th of all schools in the state and made
negligible progress toward the school's state-imposed growth target.
Sixty percent of Fremont's 10th- and 11th-graders and 75% of its
ninth-graders scored below basic or far below basic in
English/Language Arts compared with less than 40% statewide.</TE>
<TE>   On his initial visit last November, Jackson observed hundreds of
students routinely milling about campus as class was in session and
many teachers failing to engage students at the level required by
state standards. There also was a legacy of antagonism between
instructors and administration.</TE>
<TE>   The climate was dramatically different in October, according to
his report.</TE>
<TE>   "Where there were once 200 to 300 students out of class during
class time, during this visit there were no more than a handful after
first period and these few students all had hall passes," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-person auditing team visited 40 classrooms during two
days on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We observed teachers utilizing deliberate and effective classroom
teaching techniques and instructional time was maximized," the report
said. "More teachers appear to be in control because they have
developed thoughtful plans of action.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are no longer distracted by a flow of students walking
in and out of their classrooms. Students, even those who appeared to
be unengaged regardless of the teacher's efforts, were respectful and
more likely to be on task than not."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, the lead auditor, praised central Los Angeles Unified
School District administrators for choosing Brunt, previously an
assistant principal at Marina del Rey Middle School, for the
difficult assignment and in providing her adequate support. He said
her qualities of self-assurance, verve, openness and resolve are just
what Fremont needs.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could find somebody like LaVerne and put her in every
low-performing school, it would really make a difference," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brunt has implemented a new tardy policy and led regular sweeps to
get students in class.</TE>
<TE>   She also enlisted teachers in weekend sessions to develop new
curriculum units based on state standards.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and students are embracing the changes with an ease that
surprised Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have expected to see a few more remnants, or a few more
teachers or students lost in the process, as opposed to what I saw in
October, which was a smooth operation."</TE>
<TE>   "They were ready for the change," Brunt said Wednesday. "Everybody
wants to be on a winning team."</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Basgall, the teachers union representative on campus,
concurred that most teachers support the changes, but said some have
noticed that they have more trouble with disruptive students.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the teachers are struggling with that at this time,"
Basgall said. "How do we intervene with the students who are not
motivated and who can suck up all your time trying to motivate them?"</TE>
<TE>   She said she has found Brunt receptive to the concern and is
optimistic it will be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   The report also commended the school for opening more bathrooms to
students.</TE>
<TE>   One sour note was in the area of involvement with the families of
Fremont's students, of whom 87% are Latino and nearly 13% are black.
Despite finding more communication between the school and parents in
English and Spanish, the report criticized the school for not having
a parent center.</TE>
<TE>   More generally, the report's optimism was tempered by the reality
that much of Fremont's student body is far behind academically.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson acknowledged that gap in his report, but praised school
officials for training teachers in sheltered-English strategies that
use props and gestures to overcome language barriers.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of Fremont's students did not have English as their
first language, district records show.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, it was apparent to the monitoring team
that all Fremont students -- not just those who speak a foreign
language at home -- could benefit from those techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "Though there's a sense of urgency," Jackson said, "the reality is
the turnaround won't be as fast as we would like."</TE>

<HD>New Shell Permitted at Hollywood Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction on the Hollywood Bowl's new orchestra shell, delayed for
two years because of a lawsuit by local preservationists, can go
forward after a California Supreme Court decision Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The panel let stand a Court of Appeal decision in August against
Robert Nudelman, a leader of Hollywood Heritage Assn., and another
preservationist group, Friends of the Santa Monica Parks and
Seashore. They filed suit two years ago to prevent Los Angeles County
and the Bowl's main tenant, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn., from
tearing down the Bowl's 73-year-old white shell to replace it with an
acoustically superior model.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district
includes the Bowl, said shell construction will begin next fall,
immediately after the Bowl's 2003 summer season. The new shell will
be ready for the Bowl's 2004 season. He added that delays should not
significantly increase its $18-million budget.</LD>
<TE>   Attorney Lawrence Teeter, who represented the conservationists,
said Wednesday: "We are disappointed of course. Historic preservation
has never rated very high in Los Angeles. We are evaluating our
options."</TE>

<HD>Pair Face Hate-Crime Charges in Assault Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men of Iranian Muslim descent have been charged with assault and
commission of a hate crime against a man of Iranian Jewish descent in
a Sept. 15 incident outside a West Hollywood nightclub, prosecutors
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Daoud Mohammed Majid,19, and Mohammed Hassan Aref, 22, both of Los
Angeles, are scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court in Beverly
Hills on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The charges were disclosed Wednesday by the district attorney's
office following a lengthy investigation and review after the men
were arrested by sheriff's deputies in West Hollywood at the time of
the incident.</LD>
<TE>   Majid and Aref are now charged with "assault by means likely to
produce great bodily injury," a felony, with hate-crime enhancements
of acting voluntarily and in concert with others.</TE>
<TE>   According to witness accounts, Majid, Aref and up to 15 others who
have not been identified chanted, "Kill the Jews!" as they kicked the
victim on the ground, authorities alleged. The incident followed a
"Persian night" promotion at the Goodbar nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the Council of Iranian-American Jewish
Organizations, George Haroonian, said Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   "I am satisfied that the district attorney has decided to file the
charges and proceed on this case, particularly with the charge of
hate-crime enhancement, because, frankly, my hope is that this case
will be a teaching situation for the young Iranian Muslims in this
community, about tolerance and accepting others and respecting
others' rights."</TE>
<TE>   The assault alleged in this case is not connected to several
attacks on gay men in West Hollywood about the same time.</TE>

<HD>Apparent Overdose Death Evidence of Growing Threat</HD>
<DH>Ojai Valley woman may be latest victim of what county
authorities say is a rising trend of teens using dangerous drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gail Davis and Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The death of an 18-year-old Ojai Valley artist last weekend of an
apparent drug overdose spotlights a growing problem not only in that
bucolic enclave, but in Ventura County overall, authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The death of Tamima Al-Awar, daughter of an Ojai art gallery and
movie theater owner, is only the most recent tragedy resulting from a
continuing increase in teenagers' use of dangerous drugs such as
heroin, LSD, cocaine and methamphetamine, Ojai Police Chief Gary
Pentis said.</LD>
<LD>   "This year alone we've had six narcotics overdoses in the valley,
and one narcotic death," said Pentis, not including the Al-Awar
fatality. "And there's been a cycle back to opiates as a drug of
choice among youth."</LD>
<TE>   Al-Awar, who graduated from exclusive Thacher School in June, was
reported dead about 1:30 Saturday afternoon after she was found at
her home in the east Ojai Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Police said evidence at the scene indicates she died from an
overdose of an opiate-based drug, possibly heroin or the prescription
drug OxyContin.</TE>
<TE>   Police are looking for the source of the drug she apparently used.
No arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager's official cause of death has not been determined,
pending lab tests, said Craig Stevens, senior deputy medical
examiner. What drugs, if any, were in her system won't be known for
up to 16 weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, at least eight Ventura County teenagers
have died of drug-related causes, including two of heroin overdoses,
said Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran.</TE>
<TE>   The woman's parents, Khaled and Sheryl Al-Awar, could not be
reached for comment. But friend John Grant, at the family's Primavera
Gallery on Ojai's main street, said the parents do not believe the
woman died of a drug overdose.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an angel on Earth," said another friend at the shop.</TE>
<TE>   In an obituary that ran in newspapers Wednesday, the teenager was
described as an aspiring artist who hoped to study at the Academy of
Art College in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   An Ojai native, Al-Awar was living at home while working at the
gallery and theater and enrolled in a painting course at Santa
Barbara City College, the obituary said. She painted at her home
studio.</TE>
<TE>   "She touched many lives and she will be dearly missed," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Thacher School officials would not comment except to describe
Al-Awar as a painter.</TE>
<TE>   Pentis said the death only underlines a message he has been trying
to spread to Ojai Valley parents -- that drug use is spiking sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Drug arrests in the Ojai Valley rose from 178 three years ago to
396 in 2001, and the count is expected to be even higher this year,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, in the five cities served by the Sheriff's Department
and the unincorporated area, drug-related arrests soared from 1,332
in the first six months of 2001 to 1,859 for the same period this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Pentis said he could not say what portion of those arrests
involved teenagers, but he said most of the increase has been in the
18 to 25 age group.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in this trend where youths have been offending
prescription drugs, including some of these designer drugs, at the
party scene," he said. "Methamphetamine is the biggest problem up
here."</TE>
<TE>   He said that the Ojai police station has the highest arrest rate
for drug use of all the sheriff's stations in the county, including
those in Thousand Oaks, Camarillo, Moorpark and Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   "In raw numbers, we have led all of those cities," he said.
Thousand Oaks, by comparison, has three times the population of the
communities served by the Ojai station.</TE>
<TE>   Susana Arce, assistant principal at Ojai's Nordhoff High School,
said teen drug use touches all parts of the community.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes across socioeconomic levels," she said. "We're not
talking about any particular type of student. It's just cutting a
huge swath across the population. It's a shock to many parents --
they're in denial."</TE>
<TE>   Undersheriff Craig Husband, formerly the head of the county's
narcotics unit, said anecdotal evidence also indicates a spike in
drug use by juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   "I speak with increasing numbers of parents whose children are
becoming addicted to serious drugs," Husband said. "Young people who
I know have overdosed on drugs and died within the past year.</TE>
<TE>   "Drugs have always been a very dangerous proposition," he said.
"But years ago, it was rare that someone who experimented with drugs
was likely to overdose the first or second time. The possibility of
that is much greater today, because of the potency of drugs."</TE>
<TE>   One increasingly popular and potent drug when altered is
OxyContin, a prescription painkiller that produces a powerful,
heroin-quality high.</TE>
<TE>   The synthetic opiate comes in pill form, which gradually releases
the drug over a 12-hour period to reduce the risk of a sudden,
intense effect and the opportunity for addiction.</TE>
<TE>   But users may cancel that out by crushing the pill, then snorting
or injecting it.</TE>
<TE>   From 2000 to 2001, nonmedical use of OxyContin more than doubled
in the U.S., from 399,000 users in 2000 to 957,000 in 2001, the
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported in September.</TE>
<TE>   Heroin, rarely used by young people locally a decade ago, appears
to be making a strong comeback, said Cary Quashen, president of
Action, a group that contracts with Ventura County to treat
drug-addicted teens.</TE>
<TE>   "Heroin has really been knocking at our doors," Quashen said. "It
means that kids are playing with higher-caliber drugs, and we need to
be more aware."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason for the surge is that the drug has become less
scary for suburban teenagers, Quashen said. Most of them now are
smoking heroin rather than using needles to inject it.</TE>
<TE>   "What they need to understand is that it's just as addictive and
dangerous, whether you smoke it or shoot it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Quashen and others said, the vast majority of young people
abusing drugs in Ventura County are using alcohol, marijuana,
prescription drugs and methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,500 teenagers were served last year through either Action
or the Palmer Drug Abuse Program in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   While most drug treatment professionals think the problem is
getting worse, no one can say for sure how many local teens are using
drugs or alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   But county officials estimated two years ago that 10% -- or 10,000
-- local teens used drugs or alcohol regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Tovar, who oversees the county's alcohol and drug treatment
programs, said he isn't sure what the true figure is.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize we need to know this, and we're working on it," he
said. "But right now we have no idea."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is clear: The county suffers from a crippling lack of
resources to treat teenagers who need help.</TE>
<TE>   That is particularly true in tiny Ojai -- one of the only cities
in the county without a publicly funded drug treatment program for
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Ginny Connell, executive director of the Palmer program, said she
recently lost funding for weekly group meetings in Ojai and Oak View.
She applied for a $20,000 grant to revive them.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were up there we certainly saw a need to be there,"
Connell said. "It's unconscionable for us to not have at least a
small presence in that community."</TE>
<TE>   Resources are short in other areas, as well. Tovar estimates he
needs at least $1 million for an effective drug program for
adolescents, but works with a budget of about $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   Most glaring is the county's shortage of beds for residential drug
treatment -- necessary for teenagers who have full-blown addictions
to drugs and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Action recently reopened a Santa Paula center that offers six
spots for youths. There is little else available.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Awar's death is a reminder of that disparity, Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to pretend there isn't really a problem, until
something like this happens," she said. "We have to be honest with
ourselves that there is a serious problem, and we are not doing
enough about it."</TE>

<HD>It Doesn't Pay to Lose Touch With IRS</HD>
<DH>Agency owes $8 million to 9,283 Southland residents but
lacks their addresses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service has about $8 million in unclaimed
refunds for taxpayers in Southern California, including $51,813 owed
on a return from Orange County and $71,845 on one from Riverside
County.</LD>
<LD>   IRS officials said most of the unclaimed checks are from 2001
income tax filings, but some refunds are from earlier years.
Spokesman Raphael Tulino said the agency has 9,283 checks due
taxpayers from Los Angeles to Imperial counties.</LD>
<LD>   The refunds range from $1 to the $71,845 due on the return filed
in Riverside County, Tulino said. Taxpayers in Los Angeles County
alone are due $4.14 million in refunds. The remaining $3.64 million
is due taxpayers in Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, San Diego and
Imperial counties.</LD>
<TE>   Statewide, the IRS is trying to return $13.4 million owed on
15,589 refunds, Tulino said. The largest is $103,000, and the average
is $862, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The most common reason why these checks don't get delivered is
because the taxpayer has moved and we don't have a new address," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Until early December, taxpayers can check the status of their
refunds by going online at www.irs.gov and the "Where's My Refund"
link. After that, the site will be taken offline for updating, so
taxpayers should call (800) 829-1040.</TE>

<HD>Mormon Temple OKd, Ending Months of Debate in Newport</HD>
<DH>The church's decision to reduce a steeple's height wins the
support of the city and most neighbors, who feared the tower would
hurt land values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Church officials have won Newport Beach's approval to build Orange
County's first Mormon temple, ending a yearlong controversy over the
height of a steeple.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very pleased with the results of the meeting," Weatherford
T. Clayton, president of the church's Newport Beach stake, said
Wednesday, a day after the City Council unanimously approved plans
for the 17,575-square-foot temple at 2300 Bonita Canyon Drive.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints were at Tuesday's meeting and applauded the council's action,
as did some residents who had earlier criticized the proposed temple.</LD>
<TE>   Members of the Bonita Canyon Homeowners Assn. had said they were
worried that the steeple -- to be topped with a gold-colored statue
of a trumpeting angel -- would dominate their hillside skyline and
decrease property values.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the church had proposed a 124-foot steeple, then
reduced it to about 100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a compromise by the church to lower the steeple's
height to 90 feet saved the proposal, said Councilman Steve Bromberg,
who helped resolve the neighborhood feud in his district.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to avoid a civil war here," Bromberg said. "It
almost got to one. In the end, though it was only 10 feet of
difference, it may have been a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal was to facilitate and do it in such a way to give
everyone a comfort factor. However, I knew not everyone would be
thrilled with the results."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Brombal, president of the homeowners group, said the
90-foot height limit was acceptable to most of the group's 287
members.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents hired an attorney to appeal the Planning
Commission's approval of the temple. But attorney Ronald Talmo's only
comment after the council's decision was that his clients were
pleased with the results.</TE>

<HD>Newport Approves Mormon Temple</HD>
<DH>The church's decision to reduce a steeple's height wins the
support of the city and most neighbors, who feared the tower would
hurt land values.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Church officials have won Newport Beach's approval to build Orange
County's first Mormon temple, ending a yearlong controversy over the
height of a steeple.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very pleased with the results of the meeting," Weatherford
T. Clayton, president of the church's Newport Beach stake, said
Wednesday, a day after the City Council unanimously approved plans
for the 17,575-square-foot temple at 2300 Bonita Canyon Drive.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints were at Tuesday's meeting and applauded the council's action,
as did some residents who had earlier criticized the proposed temple.</LD>
<TE>   Members of the Bonita Canyon Homeowners Assn. had said they were
worried that the steeple -- to be topped with a gold-colored statue
of a trumpeting angel -- would dominate their hillside skyline and
decrease property values.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the church had proposed a 124-foot steeple, then
reduced it to about 100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a compromise by the church to lower the steeple's
height to 90 feet saved the proposal, said councilman Steve Bromberg,
who helped resolve the neighborhood feud in his district.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to avoid a civil war here," Bromberg said. "It
almost got to one. In the end, though it was only 10 feet of
difference, it may have been a mile."</TE>
<TE>   Bromberg said he took his role seriously after it became evident
that both sides were not willing to compromise. The church had made
concessions to its temple plans but the steeple's height was the last
sticking point.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal was to facilitate and do it in such a way to give
everyone a comfort factor. However, I knew not everyone would be
thrilled with the results," Bromberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Brombal, president of the homeowners group, said the
90-foot height limit was acceptable to most of the group's 287
members.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to put this behind us now," Brombal said.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents hired an attorney to appeal the Planning
Commission's approval of the temple. But attorney Ronald Talmo's only
comment after the council's decision was that his clients were
pleased with the results.</TE>
<TE>   The church had voluntarily scaled back its plans for the temple,
including cutting hours of lighting, lowering lighting wattage by 30%
and changing the temple's bright white exterior to an earth tone.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased with how the community now feels about the temple,"
Clayton said. "I hope the whole community will support and take pride
in the structure."</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the $10-million structure is expected to take 18
months to two years.</TE>

<LD>The Bristol Street offramp from the northbound San Diego Freeway in
Costa Mesa will remain closed another week because recent rains
slowed efforts to rebuild the exit, Caltrans officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The ramp, which is being redesigned to eliminate dangerous weaving
by drivers trying to exit at Bristol while others merge into
northbound traffic, is now scheduled to reopen Nov. 22. Caltrans had
planned to put the exit back into service Friday after a two-week
closure.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the storm saturated the soil. Work will resume when
the ground dries.</LD>

<HD>Citing Mailers, Baca No Longer Backs Pacheco</HD>
<DH>Sheriff Baca pulls endorsement and persuades councilman's
backer to stop ads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff Lee Baca withdrew his endorsement of Los Angeles City
Councilman Nick Pacheco on Wednesday because of "hate-filled" attacks
on the councilman's rival and persuaded the author of the ads to
suspend the mail campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "I am deeply troubled by the extremely negative and hate-filled
attacks your supporters and associates are making against Antonio
Villaraigosa," Baca wrote to Pacheco. "Therefore, I must withdraw my
endorsement of your candidacy."</LD>
<LD>   Even though Ricardo A. Torres II agreed to stop the mailers, Baca
said he did not want to be associated with a campaign in which such
tactics were used. He called on Pacheco's campaign to cease the
distribution of any mail that has the sheriff's name or photograph.</LD>
<TE>   Torres, a Pacheco supporter, last week sent a mailer to voters in
the 14th Council District accusing Villaraigosa of ignoring the needs
of Latino constituents at the urging of "white advisors" and
"gringos." A second mailer by Torres accused Villaraigosa of being a
"womanizer."</TE>
<TE>   Torres issued a statement Wednesday saying that after talking with
Baca, he decided that "effective today, I am suspending my next
series of truth-based mailers about Antonio Villaraigosa's lack of
honesty and integrity until something causes me to do otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   The personal injury attorney described the sheriff as a "good
friend." Baca worked with Torres' father when Baca was head of the
court services section of the Sheriff's Department and the senior
Ricardo Torres was presiding judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court
in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Torres said the Pacheco campaign had "absolutely no
involvement in my personally financed campaign," and offered no
remorse for the mailings.</TE>
<TE>   "My campaign has accomplished its goal of revealing Antonio's
Machiavellian moves to eliminate effective community- based leaders
like Councilman Nick Pacheco ... so he can be mayor," Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Baca said he told Pacheco and Torres that he felt
the mailers were "rather divisive from the standpoint of race."</TE>
<TE>   "It totally undermines the effort of myself and others to keep
harmony in the community and this county," said Baca, who endorsed
Villaraigosa in the 2001 mayoral campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa is one of five candidates challenging Pacheco in the
March 2003 election.</TE>
<TE>   Though Pacheco has said repeatedly that he had nothing to do with
the mailers, the sheriff noted that the councilman "implied
endorsement of the content" by saying publicly that he thought the
mailers involved "facts."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Pacheco called the mailers "inappropriate" and said
they hurt his campaign by costing him the Baca endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly why I told Ricardo he isn't doing me any favors,"
Pacheco said, adding he is pleased that other endorsers are standing
behind him after he assured them he was not behind the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said he urged Baca and Council President Alex Padilla to
pressure Torres to stop the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he wrote a letter to Torres on Wednesday asking him
to cease the anti-Villaraigosa mail campaign. "I told him I thought
dirty campaigning has no place in Los Angeles and is detrimental to
the political process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla and Mayor James K. Hahn indicated Wednesday that they are
standing by endorsements of Pacheco, although a Hahn spokesman added
"for now."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn "told Nick Pacheco he needed to denounce these mailers," said
Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "The mayor thought these mailers were
despicable."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa was far from satisfied with Torres' announcement
because Torres was unapologetic and indicated that he may resume the
mail campaign down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear from Mr. Torres' statement that he neither accepts
responsibility nor is willing to apologize to my family and the
constituents of the 14th Council District," said Villaraigosa, a
former Assembly speaker.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would file complaints with the city Ethics Commission
and the county district attorney's office alleging that the mailers
are illegal because they failed to include any reference to who was
sending them.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he refuses to commit to permanently cease and
desist from engaging in what appears to be illegal smear tactics
gives me every reason to believe we haven't heard the last of Mr.
Torres," Villaraigosa said.</TE>

<TE>   On Wednesday, Pacheco called the mailers "inappropriate" and said
they hurt his campaign by costing him the Baca endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly why I told Ricardo he isn't doing me any favors,"
Pacheco said, adding he is pleased that other endorsers are standing
behind him after he assured them he was not behind the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said he urged Baca and Council President Alex Padilla to
pressure Torres to stop the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he wrote a letter to Torres on Wednesday asking him
to cease the anti-Villaraigosa mail campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I thought dirty campaigning has no place in Los
Angeles and is detrimental to the political process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla and Mayor James K. Hahn indicated Wednesday that they are
standing by endorsements of Pacheco, although a Hahn spokesman added
"for now."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn "told Nick Pacheco he needed to denounce these mailers," said
Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "The mayor thought these mailers were
despicable."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa was far from satisfied with Torres' announcement
because Torres was unapologetic and indicated that he may resume the
mail campaign down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear from Mr. Torres' statement that he neither accepts
responsibility nor is willing to apologize to my family and the
constituents of the 14th Council District," said Villaraigosa, a
former Assembly speaker.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would file complaints with the city Ethics Commission
and the county district attorney's office alleging that the mailers
are illegal because they failed to include any reference to who was
sending them.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he refuses to commit to permanently cease and
desist from engaging in what appears to be illegal smear tactics
gives me every reason to believe we haven't heard the last of Mr.
Torres," Villaraigosa said.</TE>

<HD>Pro-Peace T-Shirts Get Campus Talking</HD>
<DH>Fullerton High teen creates strong debate and tense moments
with apparel. Pupils and teachers are gaining new insight.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Caitlin Orr was trying to spark debate on the merits of a war against
Iraq among fellow students at Fullerton Union High School. The
16-year-old junior has done that and more with the "Think Peace"
T-shirts she's been distributing on campus the last few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Even teachers are taking sides in the discussion, and the campaign
-- not surprisingly -- caused some consternation among campus
administrators.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it has been more of an issue with the faculty than the
students," said English teacher Leonardo Indelicato, who has been
wearing one of the T-shirts. "It is very exciting and very revealing.
You get to know the people you work with at a very different level."</LD>
<TE>   The shirts have brought out the political sensibilities of the
adults entrusted with educating the nearly 2,000 students at the
north Orange County campus.</TE>
<TE>   "As teachers, we are supposed to teach students to look at things
critically," Indelicato said. "It is wonderful for [students] to see
teachers with different points of view working together. We have a
strong sense of family here."</TE>
<TE>   There have been tense moments too. Some teachers were offended by
the shirts, Indelicato said, even moved to tears. One confronted him
recently.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she had lost someone in the Sept. 11 attacks and that we
should support the [U.S.] government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not blindly, argues Caitlin, a vivacious, fast-talking teenager
whose orange backpack is adorned with beads, peace signs and slogans.</TE>
<TE>   At her family's Fullerton home earlier this week, she was wearing
one of her T-shirts, a black crew neck with a white peace sign on the
front and the words "Think peace. Support the anti-war movement."</TE>
<TE>   "People get a little caught up in saluting the flag instead of
supporting the people who surround the flag," said Caitlin, an A
student and member of the school's soccer, track, debate and speech
teams. "My shirts are more of an effort to bring out the hidden peace
activists.... There are lots of people who feel the same way I do,
and they need the boost."</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin said she has sold 100 T-shirts and is getting more orders
every day. She charges $15 each to cover costs and to pay for peace
buttons she distributes free.</TE>
<TE>   The shirts come with a note from Caitlin urging people to wear
them to school each Friday and to "Rock on!" They began popping up
around campus two Fridays ago.</TE>
<TE>   At first, though, Caitlin had to pay a visit to the principal's
office. She was told she couldn't sell them on campus because the
activity was not sanctioned by a recognized student group. Instead,
she collects the money after school hours but is in the process of
forming a student peace group. School administrators did not return
calls requesting comment.</TE>
<TE>   The T-shirts have gotten the students talking -- and debating.
Caitlin's efforts were featured in the school's newspaper, The
Pleiades.</TE>
<TE>   She also wrote an antiwar column for the paper detailing her
views.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 was an atrocious tragedy," she wrote. "I am not
understating the profound grief it caused, [but] Americans should
consider why it is that so many countries, especially in the Middle
East, hate us so much."</TE>
<TE>   In a counterpoint column, fellow student Stephen Huck wrote, "I
would invite all those who favor peace to take your signs to Iraq.
I'm sure [Saddam Hussein] would be happy to honor every one of you
with a bullet."</TE>
<TE>   It all makes history teacher Jeff Rupp proud.</TE>
<TE>   "They are using their heads," said Rupp, who also has been wearing
the T-shirt -- not so much to protest war, he said, but to support
Caitlin's efforts to initiate discussion.</TE>
<TE>   A Vietnam War veteran, Rupp said he has been criticized by
teachers opposed to the T-shirts. They, like the students, are
"entitled to their opinions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin's parents are proud too.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear how apathetic kids are these days, and she has never
been," said her mother, Lynne Orr, a pacifist. "I would hope I could
support anything she does, but it is easier when it is something that
we really believe in."</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin designed the T-shirts, borrowing for the back a refrain
from a bumper sticker she saw on a recent trip to UC Berkeley: "War
doesn't decide who is right, only who's left."</TE>
<TE>   "Berkeley is a proving place for activists," said Caitlin, who is
considering attending that university, Stanford and Ivy League
schools. "I am a little activist in the making."</TE>

<HD>Playa Vista Plans Sharply Curtailed</HD>
<DH>The downsizing is part of the expected sale of 193 acres as
a nature preserve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Groves</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playa Vista developers have dramatically reduced the project's number
of proposed housing units and amount of retail and office space in
anticipation of selling 193 acres of their holdings west of Lincoln
Boulevard for a nature preserve.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the 13,000 housing units envisioned in the project's
original master plan, Playa Vista at completion would have 5,846
units, according to a "notice of preparation" for the project's
second and final phase that city planners will begin distributing
today. The overall space for retail would be slashed by nearly 70%,
to 185,000 square feet.</LD>
<LD>   Although a formal deal to sell land to the state is still weeks or
months away and opposition to the overall project remains strong,
Playa Vista President Steve Soboroff said Wednesday that he is
confident the developers and the Trust for Public Land will reach an
accord. That would stave off construction on 193 acres that are part
of the Ballona Wetlands ecosystem.</LD>
<TE>   "Failure is not an option with the TPL deal," Soboroff said in a
telephone interview. "This is something that needs to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit trust, which has been negotiating with Playa Vista
since August 2001, serves as the state government's broker in such
matters. For the purchase, it plans to tap voter-approved funds set
aside by the just-passed Proposition 50 and other initiatives geared
at preserving coastal land and other parcels.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to conclude this transaction, it's going to take
money from a number of different sources," said Reed Holderman, the
Trust for Public Land's California director. "Had Proposition 50 not
passed, we were wondering if we could do this."</TE>
<TE>   With rumors swirling that the price could top $100 million,
wetlands supporters cautioned that the state risks paying too dearly
for the two swaths of scrub brush and wetlands. The deal would
include all of a section designated Area A and part of a section
designated Area B.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move, they said, could threaten any future purchases of
preserves along California's coast by setting too high a benchmark
price. Particularly vulnerable to escalating preservation costs, they
said, would be the Los Cerritos Wetlands in Long Beach and the Bolsa
Chica Wetlands in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In its analysis, the Ballona Wetlands Land Trust, an environmental
group, put the value of the Playa Vista parcels at closer to $22
million, a figure that reflects the group's view that public
officials will not approve further development on the land between
Marina del Rey and the Westchester bluffs. Soboroff strongly disputed
that notion.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Francis, executive director of the Ballona Wetlands Land
Trust, said his group wrote its analysis to guide officials in
Sacramento, who will be making the decision about the land's value.</TE>
<TE>   Playa Vista opponents contend that an inflated sale price would
provide the developers, in effect, with a subsidy that would fund
construction of the rest of the project. They also noted that Playa
Vista contributed more than $830,000 to help pass Proposition 50.</TE>
<TE>   Activists indicated that they plan to fiercely oppose Playa
Vista's next stage, just as they have the first phase of development
over the last two decades. Although judges and state and local
agencies have primarily ruled in Playa Vista's favor, legal
challenges have succeeded in slowing the project.</TE>
<TE>   Some activists reiterated their long-held view that all of Playa
Vista's 1,087 acres should have remained undeveloped, including the
land east of Lincoln where hundreds of apartments and condominiums
have already altered the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that no development belongs on this sensitive,
critical ecosystem," said Kathy Knight, wetlands coordinator for the
Spirit of the Sage Council, a conservation group that is part of a
loose coalition dedicated to preserving the Ballona Wetlands. "Los
Angeles County has destroyed 95% of its wetlands system, way more
than any other county. This last ecosystem is like gold."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Fleischli, executive director of Santa Monica Baykeeper,
charged that the project already has "enormous problems with traffic,
water quality and environmental impact from Phase 1," adding: "How in
the world are they going to be able to justify more development?"</TE>
<TE>   For the project's second stage, Soboroff said he envisions a
"smaller, greener" development. Plans call for 2,600 new homes as
well as retail shops and restaurants in a 162-acre area that would be
called the Village.</TE>
<TE>   When added to the 3,246 residential units approved for the
project's first phase, most of which are still being built, the new
housing would bring the total number of units at completion to 5,846.
That would be 55% below what was laid out in the original master plan
a decade ago, but still enough to house a projected 13,500 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Retail space would be reduced by nearly 70% from original plans,
to a total of about 185,000 square feet. Of that, 150,000 square feet
would be in the Village, an amount roughly comparable to the retail
space found along Larchmont Boulevard in Los Angeles, though
configured more as a town square.</TE>
<TE>   Office space would total 3.4 million square feet, about a third
less than initially envisioned for the entire project.</TE>
<TE>   Of Phase 2's 162 acres, an estimated 70 are expected to be
dedicated to habitat protection, bluff restoration and parks.</TE>
<TE>   The "town center" would feature dry-cleaning establishments, nail
parlors and other businesses aimed at serving Playa Vista's renters
and homeowners. Plans for a 750-room hotel are now completely off the
books, Playa Vista officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals were revealed in the "notice of preparation" that
Playa Vista sent Friday to city planners. That filing is the first
step in what the developers expect to be a yearlong process of public
comment and environmental analysis that will culminate in the release
of an environmental impact report. Building would probably begin in
2005, with completion by 2008, Soboroff said.</TE>
<TE>   The Phase 2 portion described in the scaled-down plan lies along
Jefferson Boulevard in the heart of the Playa Vista property. The
Village would be built between apartments, condos and single-family
homes already underway at the corner of Lincoln and Jefferson
boulevards, and a commercial campus slated for the area farther east,
near the San Diego Freeway. Runways constructed for industrialist
Howard Hughes once ran across the property designated for Phase 2.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to gain support for the plans, Soboroff said Playa Vista
officials are scheduling a whirlwind round of meetings with dozens of
neighborhood groups, homeowner associations, environmental
organizations and chambers of commerce. On Wednesday, he briefed
Mayor James K. Hahn and Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, Soboroff said, community meetings would not begin until
after a draft environmental impact report is published. That
preliminary report is expected to come out in the spring. The first
public meeting on the plan will be Dec. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Soboroff said he took pride in the scaled-back plans.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen months ago, he said, Playa Vista had ready an expensive,
28,000-page environmental impact report with plans for 13,000 housing
units, a big hotel and a huge regional shopping center.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my employment-contract conditions was that we rethink
that," he said. "Today is living proof that we did."</TE>

<HD>2 City Officials Receive Raises Despite Critics</HD>
<DH>Mayor says the pay boosts for Thousand Oaks' attorney and
manager are too much. A new councilman says he deserved a say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite objections by Mayor Ed Masry and incoming Councilman Bob
Wilson, the Thousand Oaks City Council has granted pay raises to its
city manager and city attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Masry, who last year wanted at least one of the top officials
fired, said Wednesday the raises for City Manager MaryJane Lazz and
City Atty. Mark Sellers were excessive considering the uncertainty of
state budget cuts, which could mean millions of dollars in lost
revenues for California cities. He voted against the pay hikes.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt that she [Lazz] was at the top of the ladder," he said.
"This pay raise gave her over $200,000 a year [including the value of
benefits], and I felt that was not justified in light of the fiscal
situation."</LD>
<TE>   Based on the raises the council approved 3 to 0 Tuesday night,
Lazz, who plans to retire in May, will see her $162,821 base salary
increase 6% to $172,590. Sellers' 5% raise lifts his base salary from
$130,524 to $137,050.</TE>
<TE>   Along with medical, dental, vision, auto and life insurance
benefits, both officials receive a city-provided sport utility
vehicle, eight weeks of annual leave and deferred retirement
contributions linked to their base salary. Lazz receives 15% and
Sellers 10% each year based on their pay on Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The salary hikes are retroactive to July 6, according to Denese
Wilson, the city's human resources manager.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally disappointed," said incoming Councilman Bob Wilson
Sr., who asked the current council to delay a decision on the pay
packages until after he and fellow slow-growth advocate Claudia
Bill-de la Pena join the panel. "I don't feel I was asking too much
to postpone it and let the new council members take a look at it."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said Lazz must be held responsible for problems in the
city, including what he cited as substandard renovations of the
city's public golf course, lucrative giveaways on a deal to develop a
vacant site near the Civic Arts Plaza and nearly $1 million in cost
overruns on a new elevator at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Just on the issues, I don't believe she deserves a raise," Wilson
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Lazz touts construction of a new banquet facility at Los
Robles Golf Course as one of the city's successes over the past
fiscal year. She also cites completion of a regional transportation
center, rehabilitation of the former city hall and authorization of
additional affordable housing for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of the projects we've been able to accomplish this
year," said Lazz, comparing her salary to that of a chief executive
in private industry who oversees more than 500 employees and an
annual budget of $152 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers said his office's victories included stopping the local
merger of two cable television systems, winning a contractor's
lawsuit that could have cost the city $2.5 million, and helping craft
the Western Plateau land-swap that delivered 191 acres of open space
to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Masry joined outgoing Councilwoman Linda Parks in an
unsuccessful bid to oust Sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he believes Lazz's retirement comes at the right time
to allow the new slow-growth council majority to select a city
manager more in tune with environmental causes and less likely to
support concessions to businesses and development interests. And he
said the city attorney's office "has to reflect what the residents of
the city want based on how they voted -- for slow growth," which
could mean replacing Sellers.</TE>
<TE>   City code, however, states the city attorney cannot be terminated
for at least 90 days after a City Council election has been
certified. And Sellers' contract provides him with nine months' pay
if he is fired.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a survey conducted in February for the city, Lazz was
already the best-paid city manager in Southern California for
similar-sized cities, surpassing the salaries of chief executives in
Simi Valley, Ventura, Oxnard, Burbank and Irvine. Sellers' salary was
better than the salary for city attorneys in those three Ventura
County cities, along with the cities of Orange, Irvine and Santa
Clarita.</TE>

<HD>Court Curbs Logging of Charred Trees</HD>
<DH>Ruling protects trees that appear to survive fires. It sets
stage for a fight over Bush policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoffrey Mohan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal court has dealt a blow to efforts to cut down trees still
standing after a massive forest fire near Lake Tahoe, setting the
stage for a showdown over the Bush administration's forest fire
policy.</LD>
<LD>   A temporary stay issued by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
last week forbids Sierra Pacific Industries, one of the biggest
timber companies in California, from cutting any fire-damaged trees
that still have green needles on them in a 17,000-acre area of the
Eldorado National Forest. The company won a $1.7-million contract
there this year to conduct a salvage logging operation that targets
commercially valuable timber in a burned-over area of the forest.</LD>
<LD>   Salvage logging after a forest fire has been put on a fast track
by the Bush administration, which touts it as a way to recoup money
from areas burned in forest fires, and then use some of the funds to
replant a thinner, more fire-resistant forest.</LD>
<TE>   But the practice has come under attack by environmentalists, who
argue that timber companies remove the very trees that survive the
flames and help regenerate damaged forests.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's decision is the latest incremental gain by the
environmental movement to tighten regulation over salvage logging in
Sierra Nevada national forests.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to a salvage contract on the neighboring Tahoe National
Forest led local U.S. Forest Service managers earlier this year to
adopt a "green-needle" policy forbidding the harvest of any tree
showing outward signs of surviving the flames within old-growth areas
of the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Old-growth areas are the most regulated parts of the national
forest because they provide important habitat for species such as the
spotted owl and Pacific fisher. Those stands also are prized by
timber companies for their lucrative stock of large trees.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the forest service extended the green-needle rule to
all 4.5 million acres of old-growth areas in the eight national
forests in the Sierra Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   That acreage amounts to only 39% of national forestland in the
Sierras, but the green-needle rule represents a fundamental shift in
the forest service's approach to salvage logging.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the forest service has used the percentage of scorch in
the tree crowns to predict mortality of a stand of trees. Declaring a
stand dead allows forest managers to sidestep tight rules on
harvesting large trees, and in some cases has permitted timber
companies to cut down all but a few trees per acre.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's decision temporarily extends the green-needle policy
to all areas of the Eldorado forest -- old growth as well as younger
and mixed stands -- until the court can hold a more detailed hearing
in February.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists hope to persuade the court that the green-needle
rule should be applied to all 11.5 million acres of national forests
in the Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   For Sierra Pacific Industries, the state's single largest
purchaser of national forest timber, the stay could mean that the
company will not be able to harvest as much as 20% of the trees it
initially planned to fell before winter -- and perhaps make it
economically unrewarding to return next spring, said David Dun,
attorney for the Redding-based firm.</TE>
<TE>   Original plans called for 35 million board-feet of timber to be
harvested, Dun said. That is about the amount of wood that goes into
2,333 California houses, according to the California Forest Products
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Earth Island Institute's John Muir Project, based in
Cedarville, Calif., filed suit against the U.S. Forest Service over
the Eldorado project in August, arguing that large areas labeled dead
as a result of fire, in fact, harbored many live trees that would
continue to provide suitable wildlife habitat. One biologist working
for the group found evidence that owls had returned to areas the
Forest Service had declared no longer suitable for owl habitat, based
on burn damage from the August 2001 blaze.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Morrison England, recently appointed by
President Bush, rebuffed the group's request for an injunction, and
the group went to the appeals court, which granted the temporary stay
last week. Another hearing is slated for February.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, which may take months to resolve, adds fodder to an
already intense debate over forest management during the West's worst
drought in decades.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration argues that appeals and litigation have
prevented logging that it believes could lessen the fire danger in
forests where more than 6 million acres burned this year. Legislation
sent to Congress in September would exempt many logging proposals,
including salvage contracts, from public review.</TE>
<TE>   Activists contend that the administration is dressing up wholesale
logging as fire-prevention projects.</TE>

<HD>Screener Suit Allowed to Go Forward</HD>
<DH>Workers denied the airport security posts because they are
noncitizens seek to overturn the exclusion as unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal District Court judge in Los Angeles has issued a
preliminary ruling siding with workers who contend that a post-Sept.
11 federal law barring noncitizens from working as airport screeners
is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Robert M. Takasugi, in a ruling made public Wednesday,
denied a motion filed by Justice Department lawyers asking that the
suit, filed in January by the American Civil Liberties Union, be
dismissed.</LD>
<LD>   Another hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday, and ACLU
attorney Mark Rosenbaum said he hopes that Takasugi will issue a
formal injunction striking down the law at Southern California
airports.</LD>
<TE>   "This ruling demonstrates the United States can have a war on
terrorism without making our civil liberties the first casualty,"
Rosenbaum said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth J. Shapiro and a Department of
Transportation spokesman had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed in January on behalf of nine screeners who
work at Los Angeles and San Francisco international airports.
Rosenbaum and his ACLU co-counsel, Ben Wizner, contend that the
citizenship requirement enacted by Congress after the East Coast
terror attacks is "irrational" and could weaken airport security by
removing thousands of experienced employees from the system.</TE>
<TE>   The Service Employees International Union, which represents 2,000
airport screeners, some of whom have already lost their jobs, is a
party to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   When the legal action was filed, about 25% of the 28,000
pre-boarding screeners at the nation's airports were not citizens,
but were permanent residents. At some airports, the percentage of
noncitizens was far higher -- about 40% at LAX and more than 50% in
San Francisco, Sacramento, Miami and at Washington's Dulles airport.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also emphasized that there was no citizenship requirement
for airline pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers or National
Guard troops stationed at airports to enhance security after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Takasugi said that "improving aviation security is
a compelling governmental interest." However, he said, at this stage
of the case "this court cannot conclude that this categorical
exclusion of all noncitizens from employment as screeners is the
least restrictive means to further such governmental interest." The
judge was referring to the legal standard the government must meet to
treat noncitizens differently.</TE>
<TE>   Among the plaintiffs who have worked as screeners at LAX is Jeimy
Gebin, 22, of Hawthorne, a permanent resident who served from 1997 to
2000 in the Army.</TE>
<TE>   She fled the civil war in El Salvador with her family when she was
5 and received her green card five years ago, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   She and the other plaintiffs became ineligible to apply for
continuing employment as screeners because of the new law.</TE>
<TE>   The statute enacted a year ago has spurred considerable
controversy. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has pushed an amendment
to an airport security bill, sponsored by Sens. Ernest F. Hollings
(D-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), that would ease the citizenship
requirement for screener positions. The amendment is now part of the
airport bill, which has cleared the Senate Commerce Committee and is
pending a vote by the full Senate, according to a Feinstein aide.</TE>
<TE>   In legal papers seeking to have the case dismissed, Justice
Department attorney Shapiro contended that the citizenship
requirement of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act had at
least three legitimate governmental purposes: improving aviation
security; restoring the public's confidence in the nation's air
transportation system; and encouraging permanent allegiance to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU attorneys sharply disagreed and said that "restored public
confidence" is not a legitimate ground for government discrimination
on the basis that someone is not a citizen.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Takasugi analyzed the facts of the case in light of
earlier rulings related to noncitizens.</TE>
<TE>   Since a 1971 Supreme Court decision, he said, "the general rule
has been that government action must meet 'strict scrutiny' to
constitutionally justify the exclusion of aliens."</TE>
<TE>   He said there are two exceptions. One is called "the governmental
function exception," and the other comes into play when special
deference must be accorded the political branches of the U.S.
government in the area of immigration and naturalization.</TE>
<TE>   Prior decisions have held that the first exception applied to laws
restricting such jobs as police officer or schoolteacher to U.S.
citizens. Unlike such workers, Takasugi said, airport screeners do
not "perform a fundamental obligation of government to its
constituency." Rather, he said, an airport screener "is a more common
occupation of the community," and should not fall into the same
category.</TE>
<TE>   As to the second exception, Takasugi said that prohibiting all
noncitizens -- including resident aliens -- from holding jobs as
screeners "cannot be construed as an exercise of Congress' authority
in the area of immigration and naturalization."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, he said, the justification for giving elected federal
officials deference in such instances is that "decisions in these
matters may implicate our relations with foreign powers."</TE>
<TE>   However, Takasugi, who was appointed by President Carter,
emphasized that "it cannot be said that the exclusion of United
States nationals is an exercise of immigration or naturalization
authority. It could have no implication in our relations with foreign
powers, nor could it be justified as encouraging aliens to
naturalize."</TE>
<TE>   Because neither exception applies, the blanket exclusion of all
noncitizens from airport screening jobs can pass constitutional
muster "only if it is a narrowly tailored measure that furthers
compelling governmental interests," the judge ruled, saying the
government has not demonstrated that at this point.</TE>

<HD>Flight Inspires Historic Cast</HD>
<DH>A Santa Clarita artist's statue of the Wright brothers will
highlight Dayton, Ohio's centennial celebration of their 1903 feat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A native of Dayton, Ohio, Mark Henn grew up listening to stories
about aviation pioneers and hometown heroes Orville and Wilbur
Wright. Awed by tales of the brothers' first manned flight, Henn let
his imagination soar every time he looked at an old photograph his
grandfather had taken with Orville.</LD>
<LD>   So when the 44-year-old Santa Clarita artist began sculpting a few
years ago, he knew instantly who would be among his first subjects:
the Wright brothers. Henn's small bronze sculpture depicts the two
men animatedly discussing the intricacies of steering their new
flying machine.</LD>
<LD>   What happened next would forever link Henn with his boyhood idols.
After viewing his 14-inch sculpture, the organizers of Dayton's
upcoming celebration marking the 100th anniversary of the Wright
brothers' historic flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., asked Henn to do a
larger piece.</LD>
<TE>   The result is a 1,000-pound, life-size monument of the one-time
bicycle mechanics who would transform the world with their great
engineering feat. This week, the statue will be shipped to the Dayton
Art Institute, where it will be publicly unveiled Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   The sculpture will be on display at the museum until a scheduled
three-week July celebration, Inventing Flight: Dayton 2003, gets
underway at Deeds Park near downtown. At that time, the work will be
moved to the park, where it will remain on permanent display.</TE>
<TE>   "Daytonians don't get a chance very often to celebrate their
achievements, and when they do have those opportunities, many times
they don't because they are so humble," said William J. Roess, who is
one of the event's chief organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so proud of the Wright brothers and their
accomplishments," he added. "This sculpture is an opportunity to
shine the spotlight on Dayton."</TE>
<TE>   Although he declined to say what Henn was paid for his work, Roess
said "it was largely donated by Mark."</TE>
<TE>   As he polished the bronze sculpture and prepared it for shipment
earlier this month, Henn reflected on his creation and its
significance to his hometown, his family and aviation history.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Dayton are going to walk up to it and put their arms
around it and have their picture taken," said Henn, who makes his
living as a Walt Disney Co. animator. "This is quite an honor."</TE>
<TE>   His detailed sculpture is a tribute to the Wright brothers'
ingenuity.</TE>
<TE>   It depicts Wilbur, dressed in a three-piece suit, his hands
raised, as he explains to Orville his theory of "wing warping," which
occurs when a pilot adjusts the angle of a plane's wing -- much like
a rudder -- to control the pitch and roll of an aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   With his bowler hat pushed back on his head, Orville listens
intently as he twists the ends of a small cardboard box, simulating
how each wing of an aircraft would change position in relation to the
wind.</TE>
<TE>   "Twisting the wings was the answer they had been looking for,"
Henn said. "This was their breakthrough."</TE>
<TE>   When Henn's parents saw the miniature statue, they were so
impressed that they went about promoting it as a public arts project.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents, who still live in Dayton, got in touch with the
Inventing Flight Committee and told them about the sculpture," Henn
said. The committee then contacted him.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a larger version of the piece posed a few challenges for
Henn. He relied on physical descriptions of the brothers' height and
weight and recalculated the amount of wire, clay and bronze needed to
make the free-standing statue.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes when he was unsure of an exact dimension, Henn said, he
just eyed the piece from a distance to see if it looked right. "I
played it by ear a lot. I didn't want to be too technical. I wanted
to keep things loose."</TE>
<TE>   He worked on the piece in his home studio at night and on weekends
beginning in December. He meticulously chiseled Wilbur's cleft chin,
sidelong glance and upraised hands.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he turned his attention to Orville. Henn carefully crafted
the bicycle inner tube box the younger brother holds, as well as his
slightly furrowed eyebrows and thick mustache.</TE>
<TE>   He carved the brothers' signatures and the dates 1903-2003 into
the base before finishing the artwork in April.</TE>
<TE>   The clay sculpture was packed and trucked to Sun Foundry in
Burbank in June to be cast in bronze. The foundry workers were
impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most beautiful piece we've done," said owner Kenneth
F. Kalbfleish Sr. "This was quite an opportunity for us to
memorialize an event so important to the growth of aviation."</TE>

<HD>The Rocky Road to Restoring a Scenic Area</HD>
<DH>Accidental avalanche disgorged thousands of boulders -- and
almost as many cleanup ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about being between a rock and a hard place.</LD>
<LD>   Forestry officials agonizing over what to do about an avalanche
that has buried six scenic Altadena waterfalls and part of a historic
mountain tourist site have to decide whether to spend millions of
dollars on a quick cleanup -- or do it slowly, and perhaps for free.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 50,000 tons of granite boulders dislodged by a 1998
construction accident fill a portion of Rubio Canyon. The landslide
has hidden the waterfalls and remnants of the Mt. Lowe Railway, which
100 years ago was Los Angeles' most famous visitor attraction.</LD>
<TE>   The avalanche occurred when workers replacing a 4-inch pipe owned
by a private Altadena water company dynamited an overhanging rock and
accidentally loosened part of the canyon wall.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny Rubio Canon Land and Water Assn. has a federal permit to
draw water from the canyon. Its rickety pipe supplies enough water
for about 200 of the company's 3,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Rubio Canyon's waterfalls and concrete structures left
from the 1890s remain intact under the landslide debris. The canyon's
stream is also flowing beneath the rock pile.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon was the site of a hotel and incline railway station
built by promoter Thaddeus S.C. Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors stopping off in the canyon before taking the incline to
the top of nearby Mt. Lowe could view nine waterfalls -- some as high
as 112 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The disappearance of six of the falls has angered
environmentalists and Altadena residents. At public hearings and
through written suggestions, they have buried Angeles National Forest
administrators under an avalanche of ideas as to how to clean up the
mess.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the method used, it could cost as much as $6 million
to remove the rocks, restore the waterfalls and cover up the huge
granite avalanche scar that's visible from 10 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The use of rock-lifting helicopters has been suggested by some who
are eager for the quickest restoration possible. Others, taking a cue
from Thaddeus Lowe, have proposed reinstalling narrow-gauge tracks in
the canyon and using rail cars to haul out the boulders.</TE>
<TE>   One recommendation urges use of an aerial cable car system.
Another suggests construction of a mile-long conveyor belt to trundle
out the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas are more low-tech. And low-cost.</TE>
<TE>   An Altadena resident proposed that bucket brigades be organized,
using volunteers and members of local civic groups and churches to
slowly carry out the rocks by hand. "Post a reward for the person or
group of persons that bring out the most debris by a certain time,"
the resident urged.</TE>
<TE>   Several proposals call for the use of inmate labor from jails and
prisons to cart out the rocks. Another recommends mules.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty mules for 10 years might be able to haul out 20,000 cubic
yards," figured one resident -- cautioning, however, that this is
only "a back-of-the-envelope calculation."</TE>
<TE>   Other economical ideas include leaving the avalanche basically in
place.</TE>
<TE>   One suggestion is for construction of artificial concrete
waterfalls over the landslide that would be reminiscent of the buried
falls.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea calls for simply spreading the debris around the
floor of the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The most economical idea is to do nothing to the rock pile.
Advocates of that approach claim that a few major cloudbursts over
the San Gabriel Mountains would be sufficient to sweep the
100-foot-deep pile of boulders out of the canyon and into a Los
Angeles County debris catch basin south of Rubio Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials say they are intent on somehow restoring
Rubio Canyon and its waterfalls.</TE>
<TE>   An Irvine consulting firm that has spent more than a year on an
environmental assessment of the avalanche is scheduled to recommend a
rock-removal strategy to officials in mid-December. The Jones &amp;
Stokes Co. report also will list several alternatives and include
cost estimates for each, said Steve Bear, resource officer for the
Forest Service's Los Angeles River District.</TE>
<TE>   Bear, who is in charge of the Rubio Canyon project, said his
agency expects to decide on a cleanup plan about mid-March. He said
the Forest Service feels the Rubio Canon water company should pay for
the cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Ayers, an avid Rubio Canyon hiker and Glendale lawyer who for
four years has pressured officials to remove the rocks, said he is
optimistic that the canyon's waterfalls can be restored.</TE>
<TE>   But Ayers, who favors the conveyor belt concept, predicted the
cleanup will end up being financed by taxpayers, not the water
company.</TE>
<TE>   When the accident occurred, the company was using Federal
Emergency Management Agency funds to replace a pipe it claimed was
damaged by the Northridge earthquake. It hopes the government will
again come to the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   If so, the nonprofit company -- which pays about $100 a year for a
federal permit to draw water from Rubio Canyon -- will maintain its
liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   It also hopes to retain its Rubio Canyon liquid.</TE>
<TE>   As a Rubio Canon executive acknowledged last year, the battered
canyon remains the source of his company's "cheapest water supply."</TE>

<HD>State's Case: Cash, Hate Led to Murder for Hire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Building a murder case against a woman accused of hiring a hit man to
kill the wife of her lover, prosecutors Wednesday offered evidence
that Adriana Vasco depended on the Huntington Beach anesthesiologist
for money -- and couldn't stand his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Among those testifying in the second day of Vasco's trial were
former friends who said Vasco spoke often about her relationship with
Dr. Kenneth Stahl and the animosity that the two had for Carolyn
Oppy-Stahl.</LD>
<LD>   "She didn't like Dr. Stahl's wife," Nicole Nguyen testified in
Orange County Superior Court. "She called her a witch."</LD>
<TE>   Sketching what they describe as a murder-for-hire plot gone awry,
authorities contend the 35-year-old medical secretary hired a hit
man, who then killed not only Stahl's wife, but also the doctor
himself. Alleged triggerman Dennis Earl Godley, 32, faces a separate
trial next year.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco, according to prosecutors, carried on a years-long affair
with the doctor, who frequently showered her with gifts of cash and
complained that he hated his wife. The 57-year-old anesthesiologist
wanted to divorce his wife but feared he'd lose all his money.</TE>
<TE>   Together, prosecutors contend, Vasco and the doctor hatched a plan
to kill the wife, a 44-year-old optometrist. They hired Godley, a
handyman at Vasco's Anaheim apartment complex, for $30,000 and
instructed him to kill the woman on a dark, lonely stretch of Ortega
Highway. Stahl would even drive his wife to the murder site, telling
her that he had a "surprise" for her upcoming birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "But something happened that Kenneth didn't contemplate," said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Conway. "That was the murder of Kenneth
Stahl."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 20, 1999, a security guard discovered the Stahls' Dodge
Stratus idling on the shoulder of the remote highway, its high beams
on. Inside the vehicle, Oppy-Stahl lay sprawled in the passenger
seat, her feet sticking out the open door. Stahl slumped against his
seat belt on the driver's side. Both were dead from multiple gunshot
wounds, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen and other prosecution witnesses testified that Stahl would
give Vasco gifts of cash, in sums of $500 and $800. They said Vasco
often spent her money on trinkets and gifts and came up short when it
was time to pay for rent or re-register her car.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors expect to rest their case today. Defense lawyer Robert
Viefhaus, who did not offer an opening statement, will present
Vasco's case Monday.</TE>

<HD>Better Water on Tap in Ventura With Change in Purifying
Agent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Blanchard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura residents will taste a difference when they turn on the tap
later this month, as the city switches the chemical it uses to purify
drinking water.</LD>
<LD>   When the switch from chlorine to chloramines takes place, city
water officials say, the taste and smell of residents' water will
improve. Residents have complained for years about the chlorine taste
of their tap water.</LD>
<LD>   The change is necessary because one of the city's main water
sources already uses chloramines, and the two water purification
systems must be compatible for the city to blend water from those
sources, said Don Davis, the city's utilities manager. The new
disinfectant also lasts longer in the water supply and will help
reduce the possibility of cancer-causing trihalomethanes forming in
the water supply. For most residents, the change will have little or
no effect, other than improving the taste of tap water. But city
water officials caution that people with aquariums and some kidney
dialysis patients may need to take extra steps before using tap
water.</LD>
<TE>   Aquarium owners will need to add neutralizing chemicals to
dechlorinate the water before adding it to fish tanks. The chemicals
are available at most pet stores.</TE>
<TE>   And because chloramines can pass through the filter of a dialysis
machine, dialysis patients need to notify the company that services
their equipment of the upcoming water disinfectant change, Davis
said. The city has notified dialysis providers of the pending change.</TE>

<HD>Better Water on Tap With New Purifying Chemical</HD>
<DH>Ventura's switch to a different disinfectant is expected to
be completed this month. But officials caution certain residents.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>

<LD>Ventura residents will taste a difference when they turn on the tap
later this month, as the city switches the chemical it uses to purify
drinking water.</LD>
<LD>   When the switch from chlorine to chloramines takes place in late
November, city water officials say the taste and smell of residents'
water will improve. Residents have complained for years about the
chlorine taste of their tap water.</LD>
<LD>   The change is necessary because one of the city's main water
sources already uses chloramines, and the two water purification
systems must be compatible for the city to blend water from those
sources, said Don Davis, the city's utilities manager.</LD>
<TE>   The new disinfectant also lasts longer in the water supply and
will help reduce the possibility of cancer-causing trihalomethanes
forming in the water supply. Trihalomethanes form when chlorine comes
in contact with organic matter in the water.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said many water systems in Southern California already use
chloramines as their water disinfectant and that the switch in the
Ventura water supply was simply a matter of going with the flow.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that we were going to need to do this about 18 months
ago," he said. "We're a little tardy in making the change."</TE>
<TE>   At each of its three water distribution plants, the water district
is building new tanks to hold ammonia, which is combined with
chlorine to form chloramines. For most residents, the change will
have little or no effect, other than improving the taste of tap
water. But city water officials caution that people with aquariums
and some kidney dialysis patients may need to take extra steps before
using tap water.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people should only notice things getting better," Davis
said. "But the advantages that we get from chloramines -- that they
last longer -- can be a disadvantage if you keep fish or are on
dialysis."</TE>
<TE>   Aquarium owners will need to add neutralizing chemicals to
dechlorinate the water before adding it to their fish tank. The
chemicals are available at most pet stores.</TE>
<TE>   And because chloramines can pass through the filter of a dialysis
machine, dialysis patients need to notify the company that services
their equipment of the upcoming water disinfectant change, Davis
said. The city has notified dialysis providers of the pending change.
"We want to make sure no one loses a fish because they weren't aware
of the change," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the day for the switch has not been decided, Davis said,
residents have been told to begin taking precautions as of Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The changeover is not the first time the city has switched the
chemical it uses to disinfect the water supply. During a six-year
drought in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city began using
chlorine to disinfect the water supply to make it compatible with
other water systems in the region. By doing so, the city was able to
accept water from other regional water systems, which used Ventura's
pipelines to shift water to drought-stricken areas.</TE>

Water Division at 652-4500.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Denies Breach of Contract in Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Singer testifies concerts were canceled by promoter, who is
seeking $21.2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA MARIA</DL>
<LD>With 200 screaming fans outside, king of pop Michael Jackson took the
witness stand Wednesday in a $21.2-million breach-of-contract suit
accusing him of failing to show up for two 1999 New Year's Eve
concerts marking the millennium.</LD>
<LD>   The action -- being tried in this northwest Santa Barbara County
town because Jackson's Neverland estate is nearby in the Santa Inez
Valley -- was filed by Marcel Avram, a 64-year-old German concert
promoter.</LD>
<LD>   Avram contends that he was stuck with an $11-million debt and
about $10 million in potential lost revenues when Jackson did not
appear at concerts in Honolulu and Sydney, Australia. Avram had
testified Tuesday that it was Jackson who had broken the agreement.</LD>
<TE>   Avram said on the stand that he had been a Jackson family
associate since the days of the Jackson Five, "when Michael was a
little boy."</TE>
<TE>   Avram said he became involved with Jackson again after he was
asked to work out difficulties that had arisen with production of a
charity concert Jackson was planning for Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for his help, he said, he persuaded Jackson to do a
second charity concert in Germany and two millennium spectaculars
scheduled for Dec. 31, 1999. For all that, Jackson would be paid $15
million. Although the charity concerts were performed, they lost
money.</TE>
<TE>   In early October 1999, Avram said, he met in New York with two
Jackson aides, and was told Jackson would not appear at the
millennium concerts because he was too busy making a record album.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson disputed that when he appeared Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Called as a hostile witness by Avram's lawyer, Louis "Skip"
Miller, Jackson said it was the promoter who telephoned him to say
the concerts were off, although he could not recall the date.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he was prepared," Jackson said at one point. "He
canceled it. I specifically remember the telephone call. He said,
'We're not going to do those shows on the millennium. It couldn't
work to fly from one time zone to another.'</TE>
<TE>   "I remember using the phone in my bathroom where it was very
quiet," Jackson added. "I remember feeling a little upset because I
was looking forward to doing the show. I was excited because I
thought it would make the Guinness Book of World Records as the
biggest watched show in history."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Jackson's June and October depositions, Miller
questioned Jackson's testimony: "This telephone call never took
place, did it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes it did," Jackson answered. "Sir, it's not unusual for
somebody's recollection to change."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's lawyer, Zia Modabber, contends that it was Avram who
backed out of the millennium concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is scheduled to resume his testimony today.</TE>

<LD>A woman died Wednesday evening after she apparently ran a red light
and collided with another car at a Huntington Beach intersection,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   The identity of the woman -- described as being in her 40s -- was
not immediately known, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred shortly before 8 p.m. when the woman,
driving south on Beach Boulevard, ran a red light at Warner Avenue
and plowed into another car making a left turn from the opposite
direction, said Lt. Bruce Kelly of the Huntington Beach Police
Department.</LD>
<TE>   Two occupants of the other car were taken to UCI Medical Center in
Orange for treatment of injuries that were not life-threatening,
Kelly said.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>As therapists from the Los Angeles Child Guidance Clinic sit in
classrooms, they watch students deal with their studies, with one
another, with their teachers. They are looking for signs that one or
more of the children may need help.</LD>
<LD>   It's a difficult job, said Executive Director Elizabeth Pfromm.
It's not always easy to distinguish between an aggressive child who
will mellow with maturity and one signaling for help.</LD>
<LD>   "We're something of a detective in getting this information," she
said. When the therapists get enough clues, they spring into action,
hoping to prevent a child from becoming entrenched on a path that
leads straight to juvenile hall.</LD>
<TE>   "Up to 70% of the kids in the juvenile justice system have
behavioral or emotional problems," Pfromm said. "If we had seen some
of these kids earlier, it is very unlikely they would be in the
system."</TE>
<TE>   The clinic is a recipient of a $10,000 grant from the Los Angeles
Times Holiday Campaign. During the holidays, The Times is
highlighting the kinds of agencies its annual campaign helps; the
groups provide services to disadvantaged young people in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The guidance clinic helps those who have experienced violence at
home or in their neighborhood, the abused and neglected, and
youngsters who are impulsive, hyperactive or depressed. Their
behavior runs the gamut from the mild, such as the clinginess of a
preschooler who cries too much, to the severe, such as that exhibited
by a disturbed child who becomes unmanageable in class.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic trains teachers to recognize children who need therapy.
Its staff works with parents and guardians to help them understand
their children's problems. And the staffers help parents find
community services such as housing assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of our families are dealing with tremendous stress on a
daily basis, like keeping a roof over their head -- stresses that
most of us just cannot identify with," Pfromm said. Last year the
78-year-old agency served more than 5,000 young people up to age 25,
primarily in southern and central Los Angeles. One of its services is
helping people ages 16 to 25 develop skills to find and hold jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The organization operates three main clinics and works on 33
campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District, including 11
early education centers in a program called Building Blocks. The
program has been honored as outstanding by the Los Angeles Mental
Health Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, established in 2000, is
part of the Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation. The foundation matches the first $700,000 raised, at 50
cents on every dollar. The foundation and The Times absorb
administrative costs.</TE>

<HD>The Valley's Once-Mighty Tower of Pallets Has Fallen on
Hard Times</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>France can boast of the Eiffel Tower, New York has the Empire State
Building, and Sherman Oaks has the Tower of Wooden Pallets.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to look out over all of the Valley," explained Daniel
Van Meter, who built the 22-foot-tall stack of platform materials,
complete with walkways, in the 1950s (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   Other Valley high-rises, most of them more sightly, would later
obscure his view.</LD>
<TE>   But the tower is one of the 700-odd (apt word in this case)
historical-cultural monuments included in the new 496-page book
"Landmark L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Herr, the book's editor, said Van Meter applied for
landmark status amid fears that the tower might be removed as a
firetrap. "He did apply fireproofing material to it afterward," said
Herr, arts manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, time has not been kind to the tower. Van Meter died two
years ago, and when I visited his property the other day I found it

sure enough, popcorn will be served. Here are the dining entries in

<HD>A Line Must Be Drawn Between Field and Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's time to start believing those football players and coaches
when they talk about the playing field as a battleground.</LD>
<LD>   A Canadian Football League player turns his back to the sidelines
and gets attacked by a construction worker. A fan celebrating
Marshall's victory over Miami of Ohio is knocked unconscious by a
Miami assistant coach. University of Connecticut campus police break
out the guard dogs and pepper spray to keep students from tearing
down the goal posts after the Huskies won. And those are only the
incidents since last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   We don't need protective netting to keep hockey pucks from flying
into the stands, we need protective netting to keep the fans and
participants separated.</LD>
<TE>   The sports community is blowing it. What is supposed to be a
shared experience is turning into a combat zone. It was fine when
transgressions were limited to guys running onto the field to
congratulate Hank Aaron for breaking Babe Ruth's home run record or a
buxom woman running up to smooch players. Even that attempted
flag-burning in the Dodger Stadium outfield wasn't dangerous, it was
simply a form of political expression.</TE>
<TE>   But when you see someone cross the line these days you can't
expect good intentions anymore. Although it has been almost a decade
since a deranged Steffi Graf fan stabbed Monica Seles at a tennis
tournament in Germany, I still fear worst-case scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   Even when there's no harm done there's an implied disrespect for
the rules that govern a sporting event. Did you see that Angel fan
who hit Giant outfielder Reggie Sanders with her noise sticks as he
chased a ball at Edison Field? She was grinning as if she were
playing whack-a-mole at the local arcade, not potentially affecting
the outcome of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lack of civility, a lack of decorum, a lack of respect
for society in a whole," said Dr. Todd Boyd, a professor of critical
studies at USC and author of "Out of Bounds: Sports Media and the
Politics of Identity" and the forthcoming "Young, Black, Rich and
Famous: Basketball, Hip-Hop and the Redefinition of the American
Dream."</TE>
<TE>   "Sports is a place where we often celebrate violent acts when it's
contained in the field of play. It's impossible to assume at times
that it might not slip out and go beyond the playing field."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Marc Shatz, a Beverly Hills psychologist and former sports
psychologist at the UCLA athletic department, has a six-part
hypothesis for this trend in fan behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "One is the obvious: Sometimes these people are intoxicated."</TE>
<TE>   "Two: Sometimes they're the type of person that wants to draw
attention to themselves. Some people want their 15 minutes of fame."</TE>
<TE>   "Three: Sometimes they're just nuts."</TE>
<TE>   "Four: Sometimes they become, in their minds, one of the players,
and they overly identify with the players and they think they're on
the team and they're either going to attack the opponent or attack
the referee that made the bad call. They see their players express
their aggression on the field and they run on the field and think
they're one of the guys.</TE>
<TE>   "Five: When they're watching they forget it becomes a game and it
becomes very personal. Notre Dame-Michigan. Giants-Jets. They
personalize it and it becomes them and us."</TE>
<TE>   "Six: Sometimes, as with criminals, there are copycats. You watch
a game one week and there's a fan, six weeks later, a guy thinks, 'I
can do it too.' "</TE>
<TE>   When that father-son tandem attacked Kansas City Royal first-base
coach Tom Gamboa at a Chicago White Sox game in September, you knew
someone else would give that a try. Sure enough, Jody Remple actually
had other fans encouraging him to run onto the field during
Saturday's CFL playoff game between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and the
B.C. Lions. It didn't help that Remple was drunk, as he admitted in
an interview with the Winnipeg Free Press. So he jumped on Lion
cornerback Eric Carter, and then was punched and kicked by several
players.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time I thought it must be cool, I'll be a hero," Remple
said. "But I'm pretty ashamed of myself now."</TE>
<TE>   Miami defensive coordinator Jon Wauford brought shame to the whole
university (the school president said so) when he allegedly shoved a
fan who ran onto the field. Wauford was led off the field in
handcuffs by police and faces a misdemeanor battery charge.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't control the fans that come to a game," Boyd said. "We
can try to, but we can't really control them. But when it comes to
coaches and players, I think there's a higher standard. Nobody's
going to a sporting event to get assaulted by a coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes we criticize players for their behavior. A lot of
times we don't criticize coaches for their behavior. Coaches and
players are representing a city, an organization or a university.
They have to be on their best behavior and they have to be held to a
higher standard."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Shatz was so troubled when he saw the Lakers' Rick Fox
take off down a Staples Center hallway to continue his fight with
Sacramento King guard Doug Christie during the exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   "When the jailers start acting like the prisoners, the world is in
trouble," Shatz said. "It's bad enough to have crazy fans, but when
the players start mimicking that, then we're all in trouble because
who are we going to become like?"</TE>
<TE>   The extreme reaction is Connecticut's defense of its goal posts.</TE>
<TE>   If the pictures didn't remind you of a notorious campus incident,
then the Huskies' opponent did: Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't take that sort of martial law to preserve order in
the stadiums. But we're in danger of losing something more valuable
than goal posts: the notion that sports can be played in front of a
crowd without incidents. That innocent assumption is growing as
outdated as analog scoreboard clocks. Better keep those nets handy.</TE>

<HD>Giants Believe Alou Is Answer</HD>
<DH>To replace Baker, San Francisco turns to former Montreal
manager, who is 67.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants borrowed from their history Wednesday in
hiring Felipe Alou to replace Dusty Baker as manager.</LD>
<LD>   The question is:</LD>
<LD>   Did they get living history or, at 67, was too much of his passion
and energy buried amid the Montreal frustrations?</LD>
<TE>   Can the flame that seemed to flicker during his final years at the
Expos' helm be rekindled or is this totally a risk without reward?</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, of course, insist they researched those questions
thoroughly and are convinced the spark is still there, that the Expo
situation was so atypical, said Giant assistant general manager Ned
Colletti, that anyone would have suffered from the body blows.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy served as Alou's bench coach from 1995 through 1998,
considers him to have been his mentor and, sources close to the
Dodgers believe, was prepared to lobby for Alou's hiring as his bench
coach if Jim Riggleman -- one of four finalists -- is hired as the
Seattle Mariner manager this week.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, part of the Dodger contingent attending the general manager
meetings, wouldn't address that part of it, but he was emphatic in
his endorsement of Alou.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with anyone who says he's lost his fire and
enthusiasm," Tracy said. "When you consider the number of times the
Expos were built up only to be torn down, I think that would
demoralize and dishearten anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation in San Francisco should be a shot in the arm for
him. He'll have more stability than he had at any time in his last
five years in Montreal. He'll know his players won't be looking for
the fire escape every chance they get."</TE>
<TE>   During 10 years on the Expo roller coaster, the respected and
charismatic Alou was 691-717 before his firing in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Those skeptical of his hiring by the Giants point out that he did
not seem to regain much passion after agreeing to serve as bench
coach for Luis Pujols after Phil Garner was fired by the Detroit
Tigers last year.</TE>
<TE>   That situation, however, was no more invigorating than the one he
left in Montreal and Alou undoubtedly recognized it as such but was
willing to do an interim favor for fellow Dominican Pujols, since
fired.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Baker's departure, Giant General Manager Brian
Sabean, who seldom makes a mistake, did not talk to Jim Fregosi or
any other candidate.</TE>
<TE>   He went straight to Alou, who spent 17 years in the majors,
playing for the Giants from 1958 until 1963, a season in which he
played one game in the same outfield with brothers Matty and Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Sabean talked about Alou's pedigree in a conference call with
reporters and said, "He's a Giant at heart. He calls himself a
baseball soldier in conversation, but he's more like baseball royalty
to us."</TE>
<TE>   Pedigree wasn't the entire reason, however, for Alou's hiring.</TE>
<TE>   Colletti cited Alou's proven record handling younger and older
players, Hispanics and all other nationalities, and said, "We're
trying to get younger and stay competitive. We've averaged 90-plus
wins for six straight years. We want to keep that momentum going
while infusing younger players. We're not going to be force feeding,
but no one has run a more extensive gamut of handling players of all
ages and origins than Alou."</TE>
<TE>   That perception -- "Felipe did a spectacular job in Montreal, not
just a good job," Tracy said -- wasn't diluted or diminished,
Colletti added, even if some of Alou's desire ultimately might have
been amid the hapless circumstances in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to a lot of people about Felipe," Colletti said.
"Brian, who has great intuition, spent the last two days with him and
is convinced the passion is still there. In every conversation I've
had with him, in fact, Brian has been totally excited about his
dialogue with Felipe."</TE>
<TE>   If the Giants opted to dismiss the questions of passion and
energy, it was only a year ago that the Boston Red Sox made a similar
decision.</TE>
<TE>   They offered Alou a one-year contract that he rejected because he
wanted more than a year. It was also only four years ago that he
actually accepted a Dodger offer to become manager before deciding he
couldn't bail out on the Expos, leaving Kevin Malone to hire Davey
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, perhaps concerned that Barry Bonds might devour a
young manager, have given Alou a two-year contract with a mutual
option on a third year, and it is perhaps imperative, as many at the
general manager meetings said, they support him with a young and
strong coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   The memory of Alou mishandling the Detroit lineup card during an
August game against the Angels in Anaheim is still fresh. Mike
Scioscia twice lodged protests when the Tigers failed to bat
according to the card, but the protests became academic when the
Angels won, 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tracy: "I see no reason why Felipe can't be the same manager
he was when he was my mentor in Montreal."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but what kind of relationship will he and Bonds develop?</TE>
<TE>   What kind of a team will the Giants have if Jeff Kent, David Bell,
Kenny Lofton and Reggie Sanders are not re-signed, or they are not
replaced with similar talents?</TE>
<TE>   How would the talk shows and Bay Area fans respond to a poor start
under Alou while the popular Baker is managing the Cubs in Chicago?</TE>
<TE>   Can Alou light their fire? Can he light his own?</TE>

<HD>Molina, Erstad Win Gold Gloves</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Series champion Angels won two American League Gold Gloves,
with catcher Bengie Molina breaking the 10-year winning streak of
Texas' Ivan Rodriguez and Darin Erstad replacing Seattle's Mike
Cameron in the outfield.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad, who also was honored in 2000, became the eighth Angel to
win multiple fielding awards.</LD>
<LD>   Molina led all major league catchers in caught stealing percentage
(42.7%) and joined Bob Boone as the only Angel catchers to win the
Gold Glove.</LD>
<TE>   Gold Gloves, presented since 1957 by Rawlings, are voted on by
managers and coaches before the end of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Texas' Alex Rodriguez, second in most-valuable-player voting the
day before, ended Omar Vizquel's streak of nine Gold Gloves at
shortstop. The Cleveland shortstop wasn't happy about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I didn't think I was going to lose the Gold Glove this
year. I don't think I gave it up. I know I had the numbers to
compete," Vizquel said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez made 10 errors, had a .987 fielding percentage and took
part in 108 double plays. Vizquel made seven errors, had a .990
percentage and participated in 98 double plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he improved his defensive numbers. He had a good year. The
voting could go either way," Vizquel said of Rodriguez. "He's on TV
every day. He's in the national papers every day."</TE>
<TE>   Three Mariners -- first baseman John Olerud, second baseman Bret
Boone and outfielder Ichiro Suzuki -- won Gold Gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland third baseman Eric Chavez won his second consecutive Gold
Glove, as did Suzuki and Minnesota outfielder Torii Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Texas pitcher Kenny Rogers won for the second time in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez, whose $252-million, 10-year contract is the
richest in sports, gets a $100,000 bonus, a day after earning
$200,000 for finishing second in the most valuable player voting. The
others get $50,000 each, except for Hunter, who didn't have a bonus
clause.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Cubs acquired All-Star catcher Damian Miller from
Arizona for two minor leaguers in the first trade at the general
managers' meetings in Tucson. Miller, 33, batted .249 with 22
doubles, 11 homers and 42 RBIs.... Pitcher Hideki Irabu was released
by the Rangers. Irabu went 3-8 with a 5.74 earned-run average as a
closer, pitching only until July 15 because of blood clots in his
lungs. But he also had a team-high 16 saves.</TE>

<HD>Augusta Likes Results of Poll</HD>
<DH>Survey shows most agree with club's decision on female
members. Burk calls technique 'unethical.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who's right in the continuing saga of whether to admit women to
Augusta National Golf Club? In a national public opinion survey
commissioned by the club and released to the public Wednesday, the
results show wide support for the club's position of not changing its
policy and inviting a female member.</LD>
<LD>   The 48-question sampling, conducted by the Polling Co. Inc. and
WomanTrend of Washington, a market research, public affairs and
political consulting firm, was hailed by Augusta National chairman
Hootie Johnson as an important document.</LD>
<LD>   "We have received an outpouring of letters, e-mails and phone
calls encouraging us to stand up for our traditions," Johnson said in
a prepared statement.</LD>
<TE>   "It is enormously gratifying to see that a majority of Americans
feel as we do."</TE>
<TE>   Respondents answered a series of questions concerning Augusta
National's right as a private club and how it might be affected by
the campaign of Martha Burk, chair of the National Council of Women's
Organizations. Burk is spearheading a campaign to pressure the club
to admit a woman as a member before the Masters tournament in April.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson reiterated in a series of interviews last week that the
club has no timetable to invite a female member. The survey is the
second part of a new campaign by Johnson and Augusta National to
seize the public relations initiative in the five-month-old
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Burk's reaction was to spin the dispute in a new direction. Burk
said she wants to discover what effect Augusta National's campaign
will have on club members, especially those such as Lloyd Ward of the
U.S. Olympic Committee, Kenneth Chenault of American Express and
Sanford Weill of Citigroup, who made public letters they wrote in
support of Burk's position.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard from someone on the inside these coded words: 'They want
to get rid of those New York CEOs anyway,' " Burk said. "This could
be calculated as a move to gradually filter out those who disagree
with Hootie. I'd like to know what kind of position this puts the
members in, the ones who have taken a stand against discriminating
against women."</TE>
<TE>   Burk says Ward, Chenault and Weill pledged to work for progress
from within and she wants to know the status of their campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to let [those members] get away with no answer,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the items in the survey was this one: "Private clubs
and organizations should change their rules when their members or
their leadership decides to, not when one person who is not part of
their organization criticizes them or pressures them to do it." The
poll showed that 75% of men and 74% of women agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The results of another question indicated a low awareness level of
the controversy, where 59% of the respondents (46% of the men and 72%
of the women) said they could not remember seeing, reading or hearing
anything about the club in the last four months.</TE>
<TE>   Another statement seeking a response was, "The Augusta National
Golf Club was correct in its decision not to give in to Martha Burk's
demand. They should review and change their policies on their own
time, and in their own way." The survey showed 73% of the women and
72% of the men agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The survey was conducted from Oct. 30-Nov. 4, with 800 people
answering the questions.</TE>
<TE>   Burk remained critical of the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a push poll.... You push the respondent to a certain answer
by the way the question is worded," she said. "It's often used in
political campaigns. It's considered a highly unethical practice."</TE>
<TE>   The Polling Co. Inc. and WomanTrend have conducted surveys for
such clients as Major League Baseball, Ladies Home Journal, the
Department of Labor, Microsoft and Safeway.</TE>

<LD>Jeff Gordon in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "Former NBA center Manute
Bol, 40, apparently needs money, having donated his NBA earnings to
the Sudanese Liberation Army back home.</LD>
<LD>   "And the Central Hockey League's Indianapolis Ice needs a sideshow
to sell tickets.</LD>
<LD>   "So the team signed the 7-foot-7 Bol as a hockey player. Can Bol
even skate? That's pretty doubtful, since simply running was an
adventure for this guy."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Pacific 10 record for touchdown passes
in a season?</TE>
<TE>   Picking on Pete: Cincinnati Reds' broadcaster Joe Nuxhall, who
pitched for the club as a 15-year-old during World War II, has
announced he'll retire after the 2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   At a roast for Pete Rose, Nuxhall once said, "Here's how smart
Pete is: When they had that big power blackout in New York, Pete was
stranded for 13 hours on an escalator."</TE>
<TE>   Sad and soaking: Former Georgia football coach Vince Dooley
sympathized with Kentucky Coach Guy Morriss, whose players gave him a
Gatorade shower moments before a 75-yard, multi-deflected pass gave
Louisiana State an unlikely victory over the Wildcats.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "It's bad enough to
get Gatorade dumped on you when you win."</TE>
<TE>   Reason to drink: Florida Panthers' defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh is
frustrated by the team's losing ways, writes Rick Sadowski of the
Rocky Mountain News.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate losing, and I don't know why we keep playing so badly,"
Ozolinsh said. "Maybe we should drink more coffee. You laugh, but we
have to change something."</TE>
<TE>   Airhead: Dan Daly in the Washington Times: "For Steve Spurrier,
it's all about him, isn't it? It was hard not to come to that
conclusion Sunday after watching the Redskins throw pass after
ill-advised pass in their 26-7 loss at Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   "Spurrier's strategy seemed less an offensive game plan than an
exercise in ego; he decided he was going to throw the ball -- even
though he was up against the 26th-ranked run defense in the league --
and darned if he didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Really big: How far out of shape was Mets' first baseman Mo Vaughn
last season?</TE>
<TE>   Says Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News: "If Vaughn weighed in
at 275 pounds [his listed weight] last season, so did Rhode Island."</TE>
<TE>   Put down: Jay Leno, on a fan who attacked a player during a
Canadian Football League game: "Police said he had an IQ of 100,
which of course is only 65 Canadian."</TE>
<TE>   Futility: Steve Rosenbloom in the Chicago Tribune: "Midwestern
farmers are now using equipment that turns manure into energy. You
know, the reverse of the Bears."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ryan Leaf of Washington State, 33, in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Kobe
Bryant shot 17 for 47 vs. the Celtics. That off-season weight work is
paying off. Kobe not only has the build of a blacksmith, but also the
touch."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Free-Agent Questions Are Simply Continuous</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The questions keep getting asked and Coach Alvin Gentry continues to
answer them as politely as possible. He knows every time the team
leaves Los Angeles, inquiring minds want to know:</LD>
<LD>   "Alvin, what's the deal with all those free agents the Clippers
have at season's end? Aren't you concerned the guys will start
playing for themselves in an attempt to drive up their value next
summer?"</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers have eight players who will be free agents, although
only Michael Olowokandi and Eric Piatkowski are unrestricted and free
to sign with the highest bidder next summer. Six others, including
Elton Brand, Andre Miller and Lamar Odom, are restricted, which means
the Clippers have the right to match any offers.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's in the back of their minds," Gentry said. "We
can't do anything right now as far as contracts until the season is
over. So we've set our goals on the court. It's a distraction, but I
think our guys have handled it well. I don't see any selfish play on
the court so far.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I'm a little sensitive to their situations. I
understand how important the stats are to them. I might even play a
guy a few more minutes than I might have."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry isn't the only one fielding questions about Clipper free
agents.</TE>
<TE>   On consecutive days, reporters from a South Florida newspaper
asked Olowokandi and Odom about their futures as free agents.
Negotiations begin July 1, with July 16 the first day free agents can
sign new contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brand's totals of 25 points and 20 rebounds in Tuesday's victory
over the Miami Heat marked the fourth time in his career he has had a
20-20 game. It was his third as a Clipper, tying a club record shared
by Benoit Benjamin, Michael Cage and Swen Nater.</TE>

<HD>Two Miami of Ohio Coaches Suspended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Miami of Ohio assistants were suspended Wednesday after one was
charged with assaulting a fan after Tuesday's 36-34 loss at Marshall
and another acknowledged damaging a coaches' box.</LD>
<LD>   Defensive coordinator Jon Wauford and linebackers coach Taver
Johnson were suspended with pay while Miami officials investigate.</LD>
<LD>   Wauford was led off the field in handcuffs and charged with
battery -- a misdemeanor -- for allegedly shoving a fan who ran on
the field after the game. Wauford was released on $5,000 bond
Wednesday and has a court hearing Dec. 13. The fan, Robert Flaugher,
36, was treated at a hospital and released.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson acknowledged damaging the visiting coaches' box, Miami
Coach Terry Hoeppner said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoeppner said things got out of control when fans rushed the field
following Marshall's last-second victory. Hoeppner said he had taken
two university police officers with him for extra protection on the
field, anticipating a volatile situation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary," said Hoeppner. "I had more police protection around
me last night, and that shouldn't be necessary. We've lost a little
bit of our perspective."</TE>
<TE>   The postgame problems were uncharacteristic for a school that
prides itself as the "Cradle of Coaches."</TE>
<TE>   "We justify our support of athletics because of the message that
it sends about character," school President James Garland said.
"These events of yesterday suggest that we've fallen short of our
goal."</TE>
<TE>   Interim Athletic Director Steve Snyder said Miami will pay to
repair the coaches' box. The damage included holes in the wall,
Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Tennessee quarterback Casey Clausen didn't participate in
a third consecutive practice because of foot and ankle injuries,
Coach Phillip Fulmer is hoping Clausen will be able to play at
Mississippi State on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen, a three-year starter, suffered the injuries Nov. 2 at
South Carolina. He has completed just under 65% of his passes for
1,760 yards and has nine touchdowns.</TE>

<LD>College football is the only sport in which the best way to get
questions answered about the bowl situation is to hire a contract
lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   It is the only sport where a team's chances of going to a
big-money bowl championship series game depend on what your
definition of the word "or" is.</LD>
<LD>   It is the only sport where Iowa calls the Rose Bowl to inquire
about a clause that might keep the 11-1 Hawkeyes out of Pasadena and
Notre Dame has to get back to you regarding a question that could
involve a $13-million paycheck.</LD>
<TE>   In baseball, you have clear-cut division champions and wild-cards
entrants.</TE>
<TE>   In pro basketball, eight teams from each conference make the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In college basketball, 65 teams qualify for the tournament in an
event so formatted you can print out the bracket on your home
computer.</TE>
<TE>   But in college football, "any team from a non-BCS conference or an
independent institution, which is ranked three through six in the BCS
standings, shall qualify for a guaranteed selection in one of the BCS
games unless more than two teams meet this criteria. If one or more
teams other than Notre Dame qualify for automatic selection, Notre
Dame shall also qualify provided it is ranked in the top 10 in the
BCS standings, or has a record of at least nine wins, not including
exempted games."</TE>
<TE>   We're just getting warmed up here.</TE>
<TE>   In basketball, the anchor is usually your starting center.</TE>
<TE>   In college football, the "anchor" is a school tied to a certain
bowl by region.</TE>
<TE>   Most sports measure strength of character; college football
measures strength of schedule, calculated by quartile rank.</TE>
<TE>   In basketball, a good point guard distributes the ball evenly to
his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   In college football, a good commissioner slowly reads to you a
page in the media guide titled "2003 BCS Revenue Distribution."</TE>
<TE>   We have become so bogged down in this four-year-old BCS system, so
mired in the minutiae, we view minor breakthroughs as the equivalent
of the Salk vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, we rejoiced when Miami and Ohio State emerged as the
only two unbeaten teams because it was the first time all year
reporters could type a definitive sentence regarding the championship
race:</TE>
<TE>   If Miami and Ohio State win out, the schools will meet for the BCS
national title in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it will be that simple when Razorbacks fly, because one
tiny toe-stub from Miami or Ohio State and then it is back to the BCS
loony bin.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS rule book has more provisions in it than a Donald Trump
prenuptial agreement. Unfortunately, some of these convoluted clauses
contain incredibly important information as it pertains to
multimillion-dollar bowls and transportation plans for "Bevo," the
Texas Longhorns' living bovine mascot.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it came to light this week that Iowa, even if it
finishes 11-1, could be denied a Rose Bowl berth because of two
airtight clauses.</TE>
<TE>   It was only natural to assume if the Rose Bowl lost Big Ten
champion Ohio State to the Fiesta Bowl, it would happily take 11-1
Iowa as an at-large and keep intact its traditional Pac-10 vs. Big
Ten partnership.</TE>
<TE>   But that can't happen if Texas and Notre Dame earn automatic
at-large berths under BCS guidelines, the template used to place six
major conference champions and two at-large teams in the BCS bowls:
Rose, Sugar, Orange, Fiesta.</TE>
<TE>   Texas can get one of the at-large spots by virtue of the "Kansas
State Provision," not to be confused with the Missouri Compromise or
the Monroe Doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Kansas State finished No. 3 in the first BCS standings
after a gut-wrenching overtime loss to Texas A&amp;M in the Big 12 title
game. Because all the major bowl bids had already been filled, Kansas
State got knocked to the Alamo Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Wildcat fans coined a new phrase -- forget the Alamo.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS decided that wasn't fair, and amended rules to state any
at-large team that finished third would be guaranteed a major bowl
bid.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Texas stands at No. 5 in the BCS and can't win the Big
12 unless No. 4 Oklahoma stumbles down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   If Texas can navigate its way to No. 3 as an at-large candidate,
it gets one of the bids. It also qualifies at No. 4 if the three
teams ranked ahead of it are conference champions already designated
for BCS bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame has special access to the BCS because 1) it's the only
major school not tied to a conference and 2) it has excellent
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   It is written in the BCS rules Notre Dame will receive an
automatic BCS berth so long as it is No. 6 or better in the final BCS
standings.</TE>
<TE>   This provision applies to "any team from a non-BCS conference or
an independent institution," and that would include the Irish.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish are No. 7 this week in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame can be considered for a BCS game if it wins nine games
and finishes in the BCS top 12.</TE>
<TE>   To review, class, that's an "or" for Notre Dame in the first
provision but an "and" in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Things could get interesting. The Orange Bowl is already talking
about taking Notre Dame as an at-large pick if it loses "anchor"
Miami to the Fiesta Bowl, assuming Miami finishes No. 1 in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl might also take 10-2 Notre Dame over USC, even if
the Trojans finished 10-2 after defeating the Irish on Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   USC's only recourse in this case would be to beat Notre Dame so
badly it knocked the Irish out of the BCS top 12.</TE>
<TE>   And, really, besides the legal language, isn't that what college
football is all about?</TE>
<TE>   Buck Stops</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State (11-0) needs two wins to finish 13-0 and advance to the
Fiesta Bowl, where the Buckeyes would be seeking to win their first
national title since 1968.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the question: Which of the two remaining games is going
to be tougher for Ohio State, at 4-6 Illinois this week or home to
8-2 Michigan on Nov. 23?</TE>
<TE>   We're not so sure it won't be Illinois, which has won three of its
last four games.</TE>
<TE>   Reason: Ohio State has been a mediocre road team this year,
beating four opponents by an average score of 19.75 to 13.75. The
Buckeyes needed to intercept a pass in the end zone to preserve a
23-19 win over Cincinnati, trailed lowly Northwestern at the half in
Evanston on Oct. 5 and required a fourth-down touchdown pass last
week to win by four at Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   "We've weathered some storms on the road," Buckeye Coach Jim
Tressel said. "We do fully understand we need to play better on the
road this week."</TE>
<TE>   At home, Ohio State has won seven games by an average score of
37.57 to 10.57.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the Buckeyes had best not look past Illinois toward
Michigan. That kind of oversight this year could cost Ohio State the
national title.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   How did Washington State jump from No. 5 to No. 3 in this week's
BCS standings? The Cougars picked up only 1.5 points in their poll
average, but shaved 2.66 points from their computer component
average. The computer aspect of the BCS remains the biggest mystery.
Washington State moved up only one spot, from eighth to seventh, in
Richard Billingsley's rankings but jumped five spots, from ninth to
fourth, in the New York Times' computer. Those are fairly interesting
interpretations, this late in the season, over the same team after a
win over Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times also has USC at No. 3, meaning the Trojans are
ranked only one position lower (3) than the team has defeats (2).
None of the other six computers has USC ranked better than No. 8.</TE>
<TE>   You may or may not have heard of the new front-runner in the
Heisman Trophy race. He is Miami sophomore tailback Willis McGahee,
who overtook teammate Ken Dorsey in this week's Rocky Mountain News
poll. The newspaper has for the last 16 years solicited weekly
Heisman picks from 10 writers from across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Coach Gary Barnett, during a Monday conference call,
ripped the lack of Heisman attention for Chris Brown, his star
tailback. "Guys at ESPN have more control over who wins the Heisman
than anybody else," Barnett said. "They're the ones who talk about it
all the time." Contrary to Barnett's rant, Brown is in the Heisman
hunt, tied for third with Marshall quarterback Byron Leftwich in this
week's Rocky Mountain News poll. Iowa quarterback Brad Banks is fifth
in the survey, while USC's Carson Palmer and Jason Gesser of
Washington State are also receiving votes.</TE>
<TE>   North Texas made news last year when it finished 5-6 and still
advanced to the New Orleans Bowl, ending the season at 5-7 after a
loss to Colorado State. Well, the Mean Green is at it again, 5-5
overall with a chance to win the Sun Belt Conference title and
advance to the New Orleans Bowl with another nonwinning season. North
Texas, 4-0 in conference play, faces 4-0 New Mexico State in this
week's battle for first place. If North Texas wins this week and
loses the following week to Middle Tennessee State, and New Mexico
State loses its last two, the Mean Green could capture the Sun Belt
title with a 6-6 overall record.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico State is already bowl eligible at 6-4 and is trying to
break the nation's longest bowl drought streak, having last appeared
in a postseason game at the 1960 Sun Bowl. Tony Samuel, the current
head coach, was 5 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Fair or foul? While several one-loss teams can expect to get the
BCS shaft, three-loss Florida State is closing in on the Atlantic
Coast Conference title, which would earn the Seminoles an automatic
BCS bowl berth, likely the Sugar. Florida State can all but clinch
the ACC with a win over North Carolina this weekend and could still
get a BCS bid even if it lost its last two games and finished 8-5.</TE>

<HD>No. 1 Pick Signs 3-Year Deal</HD>

<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks, with a future that seems a bit brighter this
season, on Wednesday signed Joffrey Lupul, their No. 1 pick in the
June draft. He signed a three-year, $3.55-million contract that will
pay him $1.185 million per season. The contract also includes
performance bonuses.</LD>
<LD>   "We had to get it done at some point," General Manager Bryan
Murray said. "He's a real good prospect with a bright future in the
NHL. To get it done now takes the pressure off both parties."</LD>
<LD>   Duck officials, impressed with his size and offensive abilities,
made Lupul, 19, the seventh pick overall. He is 6 feet and 198 pounds
and last season had 56 goals and 106 points for Medicine Hat of the
Western Hockey League.</LD>
<TE>   Lupul sat out the first 2 1/2 weeks because of a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal was to make the team, but I was injured and didn't get a
chance to go out there," Lupul said. "When I did get back in the
swing of things, it was too late."</TE>
<TE>   He returned to juniors and has 11 goals and 24 points in 15 games.
Lupul missed his last two games with back spasms unrelated to his
previous injury, but said he would play in Medicine Hat's games this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Lupul's contract does not take effect until next season. He can
sign a tryout contract that would allow him to play less than 10
games after his junior season ends, although Murray said that would
be unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that there is a possibility that the team will sign
Tim Brent, their second-round pick in June. Brent, who is sidelined
with a neck injury, has eight goals and 25 points for Toronto-St.
Mike's in the Ontario Hockey League. He has been selected to play for
the OHL all-star team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks recalled goalie Ilja Bryzgalov and returned goalie J.F.
Damphousse to Cincinnati. Goalie Martin Gerber, who has returned from
Switzerland, also went to Cincinnati and will start Friday, then will
return to the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock said that Bryzgalov is not expected to play.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Columbus, 4 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Nationwide Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KPLS (830), 7 p.m. (delayed).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Ducks 6-6-3-1, Columbus 7-6-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Blue Jackets (2001-02) -- 1-3-0-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Ducks have struggled against the Blue Jackets,
winning only two of eight games and none at Nationwide Arena. Duck
right wing Mike Leclerc, who had minor elbow surgery Monday, rejoined
the team in Columbus and a decision on whether he can play will be
made today.</TE>

<LD>Lacking the approval of the California Horse Racing Board, Hollywood
Park has put on hold its plan to shut off betting before races start.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood had hoped to initiate the plan today, but must wait
until the racing board considers a rule change at its meeting in El
Segundo a week from today.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood Park is owned by Churchill Downs Inc., which announced
last week that its tracks would close betting about a minute or a
minute and a half before races start. The purpose was to shore up
bettor confidence, which has been threatened by the Breeders' Cup
pick-six scandal and a long-standing perception among many bettors
that some bets are being made after races start. Churchill Downs,
Calder and Hoosier Park, which also are in the Churchill family, are
scheduled to start early betting lockups this week.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Racing Assn., which operates Aqueduct, Belmont Park
and Saratoga, said Wednesday that beginning Dec. 4 at Aqueduct,
betting will be cut off at all simulcast facilities when the first
horse is loaded into the gate. Approximately 89% of the New York
tracks' total handle comes from off-track sources.</TE>

<HD>Injury Puts San Clemente in Hot Water</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Clemente boys' water polo team will be without leading scorer
Sean Staudenbaur when it plays today in the first round of the
Southern Section Division I playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Staudenbaur has a deep gash above his right eye in a nonleague
game last week against Long Beach Wilson, the top-seeded team in
Division I, and will not be available when the Tritons host Long
Beach Millikan today at Lake Forest El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   Staudenbaur told San Clemente Coach Marc Parker that the cut,
which required 24 stitches, was the result of a deliberate punch
thrown by Wilson's Garrit Barth.</LD>
<TE>   However, Barth's father Klaus, an assistant coach for the Bruins,
said Garrit told him he inadvertently hit Staudenbaur with his knee
as he tried to pull loose of his grasp.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unfortunate and we're really sorry it happened," said
Klaus Barth, who is friends with Parker. "Hopefully, something like
this never happens again. But this game is so intense, things like
that happen."</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente, which finished the regular season ranked No. 6 in
the Division I poll, filed an incident report Friday with the
Southern Section, which plans to review game films today.</TE>
<TE>   No penalty was called on Wilson at the time of the incident and
neither Parker nor Wilson Coach Tony Martinho said they saw any
punches thrown. Because the incident happened away from the ball,
Parker said nothing is visible on San Clemente's game tapes or on
those shot by Fox Sports West for its high school sports show. Klaus
Barth said Wilson's tapes also do not show any malicious activity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to trust my athlete," Parker said. "Obviously, it's a
pretty big gash. I asked [Staudenbaur] what happened and he told me
[he was punched]."</TE>
<TE>   Thom Simmons, section administrator for boys' water polo, was
expected to receive an incident report and a videotape today from
Wilson. Simmons said because the incident was not seen by the
referees, his office had limited punitive options if, indeed, a
Wilson player threw a punch.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can do is appeal to [Wilson's] sportsmanship and
appeal to them to discipline the player involved," Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Hueneme forfeited football victories over Ventura Buena and
Oxnard Channel Islands for using an ineligible player.</TE>
<TE>   The forfeits drop Hueneme's record to 2-7 and 1-3 in the Pacific
View League. Buena improves to 8-1 overall and remains 4-0 in Channel
League play. Channel Islands improves to 6-3 and 2-2 in the Pacific
View League.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Ruiz of Sepulveda Monroe, a contender for the state
Division I boys' cross-country title, tops the list of runners who
will compete in the City Section preliminaries at Pierce College
today.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, the defending City champion, has a best of 14 minutes 55
seconds on Pierce's three-mile course. But he would like to break the
school record of 14:50 set by Cesario Marquez in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   The meet will start at 2:20 p.m. with the first heat of the boys'
freshman-sophomore division. The first varsity boys' race is at 3:30
and the first girls' heat will start at 4.</TE>
<TE>   The City championships will be held at Pierce on Nov. 23.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   Irvine High has hired Flip Lanard as its girls' basketball coach
and Steve Walker as its softball coach, Athletic Director Terry
Henigan said. Lanard was a lower-level boys' coach at Corona del Mar.
Walker will be assisted by former softball coach Lisa Baker, who
stepped down to spend more time to her family.</TE>

<KH>SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Thanks to 'Net, Colton Is Really Gaining</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started simple enough. Harold Strauss, the football coach at
Colton High, was looking for an out-of-print book about the
single-wing offense. He and assistant Richie Bray Jr. turned to the
Internet and discovered more than they bargained for when purchasing
online at EBay.</LD>
<LD>   Strauss found his book, and a whole lot more -- decades-old
playbooks and manuals that augmented the ancient offense his
Yellowjackets run today.</LD>
<LD>   The single-wing formation, which went out of style in the early
1950s when the wing-T became popular, is alive and well on the
Internet among collectors and old-timers. Strauss considers himself
one of the former.</LD>
<TE>   One of his favorite books is "Modern Defenses," written in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   "As I'm looking in these manuals, I'm going, 'Nobody's inventing
the wheel today,' " Strauss said. "All we're doing is putting our
spin on it.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a copy of the UCLA single-wing playbook from 1952 for $10.
Man, we loved it. Plus, we were running our single-wing out of an
unbalanced [formation], and UCLA's offense was out of a balanced
[formation], and they had some real success with it. We implemented
it into our offense. It fit perfect. It kept getting better and
better."</TE>
<TE>   Strauss might have cornered the Southern California market on such
items, but his quarterback, Robby Pope, let the cat out of the bag
after he gained 35 yards using a play purchased off the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "My quarterback and me were looking at a book I had just received
in the mail and we found a couple of plays we really liked," Strauss
said. "We ran a play, it worked, and [Pope] thought it was pretty
cool and told the reporters about it."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year Strauss has collected more than a dozen old
playbooks, manuals and books, including one from 1929.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all are more than 40 years old. The one Pope and Strauss
were looking at was printed in 1946, and still had an original
receipt from someone who bought it -- in 1963. And it all benefits
senior wingbacks Ras Bowen and Matt Vinzon and junior fullback Tory
Kennard, while opening up the passing game.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach, you're always buying a book or tape that interests
you," Strauss said. "I actually get more out of the old books that
I'm collecting than the newer books because it fits in with what
we're doing, and a lot of people aren't using that style of offense.
It gives me a lot of insight from the dead legends.</TE>
<TE>   "We've added about 25 variations or exact plays from the books
we've gotten, and if you multiply those by our formations, we've
added close to 100 plays to our offense."</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino San Gorgonio (8-1, 5-0) will try to cast a net over
Colton's offense on Friday as the teams play for the San Andreas
League title. Colton (6-2-1, 4-1), coming off an 8-0 loss to San
Bernardino, is trying to win a share of its first league title since
1992.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the most impressive turnarounds of the season is at Rialto
Eisenhower, where Glenn Thompkins salvaged an 0-5 start and has his
Eagles on the precipice of an undefeated run through the Citrus Belt
League.</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins, 26, a 1994 graduate of Eisenhower, has guided the
Eagles to a share of the Citrus Belt title, the first time in 30
years that a first-year coach has done that. Eisenhower plays at
Fontana Miller (5-4, 2-2) on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel I'm getting the last laugh," said Thompkins, whose
first game in place of 19-year veteran Tom Hoak ended in a 49-0 loss
to Corona Centennial, which recently had to forfeit the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys stuck with it, none of them gave up, they stayed
positive the whole season and it paid dividends in the long run. I
never really felt people were looking down on us or laughing at us,
just that Eisenhower was having a rebuilding year."</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins credited the seniors, particularly lineman Ula Matavao,
for keeping the team together.</TE>
<TE>   "[Matavao] took it upon himself to make our offensive line better,
making the other players do extra work, and whether something was the
offense's fault or not, he always put it on the offensive line,"
Thompkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower, officially 5-4 overall, 4-0 in league, made its
greatest strides on defense. In its first five games, it was
outscored, 168-58; in four games since, the Eagles have outscored
opponents, 68-39.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the Serra League, many of the playoff-caliber teams in
Division I are on the soft side. Only eight of 18 teams in the Citrus
Belt, Moore and Sunset leagues have winning records, and only three
of those -- Long Beach Poly, Los Alamitos and Anaheim Esperanza --
have winning records against other winning teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Serra League alone has three programs with winning records
against other winning teams: Bellflower St. John Bosco (4-2), Santa
Ana Mater Dei (4-2) and Santa Margarita (4-3). Los Angeles Loyola and
Anaheim Servite are 2-2, and last-place La Puente Bishop Amat is 2-5
against winning teams -- the Lancers' two victories against winning
programs is the same as six teams from the other leagues that are
guaranteed a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irvine has been one of the season's biggest surprises. Many
expected the Vaqueros to finish no higher than fifth in the six-team
Sea View League, but they can win a share of the league title with a
victory tonight over Laguna Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a pleasant surprise," said Irvine Coach Terry Henigan,
whose team is 6-3 overall and one of three with a 3-1 league record.
"Up to this point, this group has accomplished more than any other
group I've coached. They've shocked all of us.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not many 'I' guys on this team. This senior class has
never won at any level at Irvine. They've been beat up pretty good
and they haven't tasted success, and to all of a sudden find a way to
win some football games, I admire them."</TE>
<TE>   When Northwood opened nearby three years ago, it took many of
Irvine's students. This is the first senior class to go through
Irvine since Northwood opened.</TE>
<TE>   The team has also persevered under adversity. The Vaqueros were
2-6-1 last year, their two best players graduated, two-way starter
Bobby Hatfield was killed in an automobile crash in April, defensive
coach J.C. Clarke missed spring practice because of neck surgery, and
two starting linemen moved out of state after this season began.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine does have one advantage over most teams. It has Terrell
Vinson, a 5-9, 165-pound senior who plays tailback, receiver,
defensive back and returns kicks.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson has rushed for 1,719 yards in nine games. Scott Seal, the
1992 section player of the year, set the school record with 1,950 in
14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson showed his big-play capabilities against Santa Ana Foothill
by rushing for 218 yards, including a 99-yard run in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Vinson is extremely dangerous," Foothill Coach Doug Case said
before a 24-17 loss last week to Irvine. "He can break it at any
time, and he's been the difference from this year's team to last
year's team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Highland (7-2, 3-1) clinched a playoff spot last week
when Kris Theus rushed for 275 yards and three touchdowns in a 38-2
victory over Littlerock. Theus has 1,246 yards rushing and 10
touchdowns this season.... Joey Schilling broke Cerritos Valley
Christian's record for longest punt, booting a 64-yarder last week
against Montclair Prep. It eclipsed the record 63-yarder set in 1996
by Kirk Saarloos, now a starting pitcher for the Houston Astros....
Phelan Serrano running back Chris Vega failed in his bid to gain 300
yards for a third consecutive game. Instead, Vega gained 192 yards
and scored four touchdowns in a 42-16 victory over Lake Arrowhead Rim
of the World, clinching a fifth consecutive Mojave River League title
for the Diamondbacks....Going into the final weekend of the regular
season, Los Alamitos and Newhall Hart are ranked 1-2 according to the
state's "power ratings" at www.calpreps.com. The teams tied in the
season opener, 21-21, both have 8-0-1 records and have the same
rating, except that Los Alamitos has an advantage based on schedule
strength. Concord De La Salle, Mission Viejo and Susanville Lassen
round out the top five.</TE>

<HD>Counter Attack</HD>
<DH>Huggins to change, but not on court, after heart scare</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone else sees the sideline act, all that raving and swearing,
and figures that's why Bob Huggins had a heart attack Sept. 28 -- at
49.</LD>
<LD>   The sidelines were never what worried his friends.</LD>
<LD>   It was the pace, the planes, all that fast food, the 2 a.m. beer,
cigars and storytelling. It was that drive he had that no one was
going to outwork him, out-schmooze him, outdo him for a player, or
have a better time doing it.</LD>
<TE>   The other weekend, not yet five weeks from the day they feared he
might die, Huggins' closest friends sat around a fireplace with him
in Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Then he did something he never used to do. He got up to leave
early.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, he'd stay late," said Jim Collins, a chiropractor who
has been a friend since Huggins became the University of Cincinnati's
basketball coach in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "But about 10:30 he says, 'I've got to get home, get my medication
and get to bed.' He didn't have any cigars. He had one glass of red
wine. He is making changes."</TE>
<TE>   Let it be said that Huggins, who spent 11 days in the hospital and
has a defibrillator device implanted in his chest, looks terrific.
There is a healthy hue to a face that used to tend toward pasty, and
he has lost 23 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a banquet in New York recently, promoting the Jimmy V
Classic, he asked for a show of hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Would all the people who say how much better I look raise your
hand?" Huggins said.</TE>
<TE>   "Like half of the room raised their hands. I said, 'I must have
looked like hell before.' "</TE>
<TE>   It is time for laughs now.</TE>
<TE>   John Calipari, the Memphis coach who is both Huggins' friend and
intense rival, watched Huggins walk into a Conference USA media
session recently and readied his jab.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks good," Calipari said. "That suit's five years old. Wide
stripes. So I know he's lost at least 25 pounds, because that suit
fits him again."</TE>
<TE>   But Calipari remembers how difficult it was to see Huggins in the
hospital the day after he'd suffered his heart attack at the
Pittsburgh airport.</TE>
<TE>   "We can be funny, but it was very serious," Calipari said. "As
funny as we can make it now, it was not then.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked awful. Overweight, pasty, tubes everywhere. He didn't
look good. And the nut case was trying to move the bed. I was like,
'Stop!' "</TE>
<TE>   Huggins tells the story of his potentially fatal heart attack his
way:</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't scared. I don't know what being afraid is going to do
for you. I just couldn't breathe. I was trying to breathe. Then I
found out the guy in the ambulance was Calipari's cousin. Then I was
afraid.... But Cal said his cousin knew not to let me die before he
beat me."</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely but true: The attendant in the ambulance really was
Calipari's cousin.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't believe it, but I'm doing OK," Huggins said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very serious. I don't mean to say it wasn't. I'm going to
have to take pretty good care of myself. My heart took a pretty good
shock. Right now, a pretty good portion of it is not working. It's
stunned. We hope it comes back. All I can do is do the things they
tell me and hope it comes back. It's not dead, it's just not working
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Though he insists the scare hasn't made him dwell on his
mortality, he said he isn't in denial, either.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was on the plane, I probably wouldn't have made it."</TE>
<TE>   He did make it, and he made it to the Bearcats' first practice of
the season Oct. 12, two weeks to the day after the heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew as long as he could walk, he was going to come back," said
senior forward Leonard Stokes, the only starter back on a Cincinnati
team ranked 23rd in the preseason poll.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the same as ever, except at practice now, he has sliced
fruit to eat."</TE>
<TE>   He was his old self at the Bearcats' first exhibition game
Saturday night too, ranting at his own players and the officials and
even kicking the scorer's table during a 20-point victory over
Northern Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "He was screaming and yelling that we weren't playing good,"
senior guard Taron Barker said. "He was just Huggs."</TE>
<TE>   Here's the only difference: After the game, Huggins snacked on
celery and carrots.</TE>
<TE>   No one, not even his cardiologist, is telling him he has to change
the way he is on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   After all, his heart attack didn't happen at courtside. It
happened amid the off-season swirl of recruiting and clinics.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with his style on court," Calipari said.
"He's not going to change that. It's his lifestyle off-court."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins is trying.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working out now," he said. "I eat better, sleep more. I just
get tired. I didn't used to get tired. Now, 9:30 or 10 o'clock, I'm
tired. But I feel stronger every day."</TE>
<TE>   He's on the treadmill three days a week. Other days, it's a
45-minute walk.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to get him to work out one time before," Calipari said.
"I said, 'Come on, let's go for a run.' We ran for a while and he
said, 'I'm not running. Let's walk.' Then he said, 'Let's go in here
and get a beer.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now it's a glass of red wine a day.</TE>
<TE>   "See, the French don't have heart attacks," Huggins said. "The
studies say a glass of red wine a day is good for you."</TE>
<TE>   He has cut back on fast food as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I ate poorly because I was always on the run. Some of the places
I go, fast food is all there is," he said. "I've had fast food once
since, and it was chicken. I haven't had a hamburger."</TE>
<TE>   The cigars? Hasn't smoked one since.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope he cuts out that cigar smoking, because it'll save
my clothing," said Charlie Spoonhour, the coach at Nevada Las Vegas
and one of Huggins' closest friends. "I've had to toss about two or
three shirts."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a hint for Huggins' buddies. If you like cigars, stay
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a very fine selection of cigars. I think he'll enjoy
giving them away," said Collins, his Cincinnati friend.</TE>
<TE>   It's all very familiar to Charlie Coles, the Miami of Ohio coach
who went into cardiac arrest during a conference tournament game in
1998. A year later, he made it to the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16 with
a team led by Wally Szczerbiak.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the changes that I've made have been off the court,
because it's almost impossible to make changes on the court," Coles
said. "You are who you are, and when that scoreboard lights up, you
can't change, so my changes have come off the court.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, I get up as early as I've always gotten up --
sometimes that's as early as 3:30 or 4 a.m. -- but now when I get up,
I just sit around for a while. I don't get up and rush around,
because I've learned that causes stress. So I get up and lounge
around for about an hour. I may have a cup of coffee. During that
hour, I'm really not doing anything -- I'm not writing plays or game
plans out."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Huggins seems to be adhering to the advice of his
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course the thing about Bobby is, he's going to act as though
everything is all right," Spoonhour said.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the easy part.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm worried about is when he gets into the season and wants
to start recruiting, taking off after the game," Spoonhour said.
"That part will be hard for him. He's been a little extreme about
working.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll find out when he gets into situations like that.
Right now he's focused and when you talk to him, he says he's got to
go do his rehab at 10.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when he thinks he's going to lose out on a player if he
doesn't work harder, that's when he's going to have to use that brain
of his, and he has a good brain."</TE>
<TE>   Intellectually, Huggins recognized long ago that he was at risk.
He had seen doctors about the possibility of heart trouble.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Charlie, had a heart attack before he was 40. He
survived and is a regular at Bearcat games.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember us convincing him to go to the hospital," said
Huggins, who was 15 or 16 at the time. "He wasn't going to go."</TE>
<TE>   To him, it seemed destined that he would have heart trouble too.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's genetic, frankly," Bob Huggins said.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching the way he does might be in Huggins' genes too.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of my friends did [suggest I take the year off]," he
said. "They said, 'Let [associate coach Dan] Peters take the team for
a year.' I think they were teasing. My family? They know enough about
me to know I wouldn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   But his wife and two children, like others, feared this day might
come.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew in my heart it had to happen sooner or later," Collins
said. "By the grace of God, he was in the place he was. God has a way
of putting us where we're supposed to be. It showed his purpose here
isn't done."</TE>
<TE>   The people close to Huggins remember the fear they'd felt when
they'd heard of his heart attack, and the relief that swept over them
as Huggins' condition improved.</TE>
<TE>   "It was devastating when it happened," said Stokes, the Bearcat
senior. "When they told us, my heart skipped a beat. By later that
day, they called us and said he was talking, and you felt like he was
going to be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Spoonhour felt much the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "It scared us all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad the boy hung around.... I think he found out how much
people cared about him."</TE>

<HD>Pick Six, Tizbud Get Attention</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second day in a row, there is a pick six carry-over of
$110,620 at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Because a power failure forced the cancellation of the eighth and
final race on Monday's card, the carry-over that had been created
Sunday was rolled over to this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   California Horse Racing Board rules dictate that when all of the
pick six races aren't completed, any carry-over is not paid. Tickets
holding the most winners -- five on Monday -- are paid out of the
money that was bet on the pick six that particular day. The pool on
Monday was $545,814 and tickets that had five winners were worth
$20,746.</LD>
<TE>   One horse who will be getting a lot of pick six attention today is
Tizbud. A full brother to two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner
Tiznow and multiple-stakes winner Budroyale, the 3-year-old will try
for the third time to break his maiden in the fourth race.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Cee's Stable and trained by John Sadler, the
California-bred was third in his sprint debut at Hollywood Park in
July, then finished fifth at 2-1 in his first route on July 31 at Del
Mar. He will be ridden again by Victor Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   Among those Tizbud will be running against are Seeking The Cat,
who should improve around two turns for trainer Richard Mandella,
Skidoo and the comebacking Musaa Ed.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth, the third leg of the pick six, brings
together nine fillies and mares going 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf. It
will be the first turf race in a week at Hollywood Park. There is one
other turf race on the card. The eighth brings together eight
2-year-old fillies going 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jim Cassidy and Leonard Duncan. Both trainers won with
three of their first five starters at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Kent Desormeaux and Jose Valdivia Jr. The two jockeys
were a combined two for 37 the first six days of Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Coconut Girl and Fun House
in the fifth, Song Minister, Cynar and Wallstreet Analyst in the
sixth, singling Himalayan in the seventh and using Alashir's World,
Miss Flor and Far From Frail in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/10. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $13/$50.40. Total money bet: $98.</TE>

<HD>Karros Will Do His Best</HD>

<AU>Jason Reid</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger first baseman Eric Karros, rehabilitating from shoulder
surgery, said Wednesday he would be "ready to go" next spring.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm preparing myself for February," said Karros, in his first
public comments since having scar tissue removed from his left
shoulder Oct. 4. "I'll be ready."</LD>
<LD>   But even if Karros returns on schedule, he might be out of time as
the club's everyday first baseman after batting .271 with a
career-low 13 home runs and 73 runs batted in last season. The
Dodgers are considering acquiring "someone to share time with"
Karros, General Manager Dan Evans said in strong comments about the
right-handed batter's subpar production in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't control what Dan Evans says, and I haven't spoken to Dan
since the last day of the season," said Karros, who handed out new
duffel bags and backpacks at a Los Angeles home for foster children
Wednesday. "His job is to put the best team out there that he can.
How he goes about it, and the manner in which he does it, is
irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "The organization is going to do everything it needs to do to put
a team out there that can win. If [first base is] a situation they
feel they need to address ... again, that's out of my control. The
only thing I can do is go out and play and do the best I can.
Basically, I make their decisions for them: if they don't feel that
I'm doing the job, then they're going to go out and [get someone
else]. If I am doing the job, then I'm sure I'll play."</TE>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Eleven games into one of the most demanding stretches in franchise
history -- 13 of 15 games on the road -- the Kings are holding their
own.</LD>
<LD>   With four games still to play to complete a season-long eight-game
trip, starting tonight against the Vancouver Canucks, the Kings are
4-4-1-2 for 11 points in 11 games, which meets their objective of
keeping their heads above water through the end of this stretch next
Thursday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   "We're playing pretty darn hard on the road," said Coach Andy
Murray, whose team has lost five of seven games, two in overtime,
since Jason Allison was sidelined. "People look at our record and say
of late it hasn't been good, but we're hanging in there. We're
battling our way through this and that's what we needed to do.</LD>
<TE>   "What we've had for travel, most teams would take our record. We
don't because I think there were two games we should have won. We
should have beaten Minnesota at home and there was no reason for us
to lose at Montreal the other night."</TE>
<TE>   Still, despite the 5-2 loss to Minnesota Nov. 4 and the 3-1
setback against Montreal on Saturday, they've remained in second
place in the Pacific Division and maintained a playoff position,
though the playoffs obviously are a long way off.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can come out playing better than .500 hockey on the road,
we're going to be real happy," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said
after Tuesday night's 4-3 overtime loss at Toronto. "But we've still
got a lot of work ahead of us."</TE>

<TE>   Fox Sports Net</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Canucks -- 0-0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- A 2-2 tie Oct. 19 at Staples Center extended the Kings'
home unbeaten streak against the Canucks to 14 games, but the Kings
lost twice at Vancouver last season, 4-0 and 5-2. Mikko Eloranta
rejoined the Kings for Wednesday's practice but probably won't play
until Saturday night at Edmonton. Felix Potvin is expected to start
after being pulled after two periods Tuesday night in favor of Jamie
Storr.</TE>

won in 10 days -- the 2-6 Lakers took a personal day Wednesday,
leaving it all behind.</LD>
<LD>   It is going on four decades since the Lakers started as poorly,
and Phil Jackson is another loss from tying his longest streak as a
coach. At least five of their 14 players are injured, suspended or
apparently unusable, two others are rookies, so the safety net's
looking pretty small down there.</LD>
<TE>   In case you missed it, Shaquille O'Neal has missed a few games --
well, all of them -- temporarily putting the organization's on-court
course into the hands of the other two sides of the triangle --
Jackson and Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Let's just say, if O'Neal needed a ride to his next checkup, he'd
have at least two offers. Everybody in the locker room would knock
over Mrs. Christie to massage his toe, if they thought it would help.</TE>
<TE>   So annoyed by the losing streak when it was at three games, the
Lakers over the long weekend shot jumpers until the nets bled and a
resolute Bryant barely made eye contact with teammates. They set
their jaws, balled their fists, squared their shoulders and ...
missed 21 of their first 26 shots against the Atlanta Hawks, missed
62 shots in all, and as of Wednesday afternoon ranked last in the NBA
in field-goal percentage.</TE>
<TE>   On top of it, the Lakers have a suspicion people are laughing at
them, that players and television analysts are enjoying this after
three springs of parades in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   So, they shrug. And they wait. And they try not to lean too hard
on Bryant, whose two triple-doubles have brought their only two wins,
now into mid-November, or fuss over O'Neal, who'll be back soon
enough. They stretch their tight ankles, and rub their sore quads,
and nod to Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   But it tries even their patience, and skews perspective earned in
their three title seasons, none of them seamless.</TE>
<TE>   "We're beat up physically and mentally at this point," said Brian
Shaw, their only consistent shooter in the last week. "Nobody knows
what to do. We've never lost at this pace.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding out how difficult it is with him not in there."</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion of week two, their highest-percentage shooter
after Shaw (52.4% field goals, 53.8% three-pointers) is the
now-suspended Soumaila Samake (.467). OK, then ...</TE>
<TE>   The three-point shooter they traded for over the summer -- Tracy
Murray -- has attempted nine three-pointers in six games. He did not
play Tuesday night despite a very short bench, and Friday in
Washington had his playing time consist of subbing in for Rick Fox
with 23.9 seconds left and subbing out for Devean George with 23.9
seconds left, around two Jerry Stackhouse free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating things, perhaps, is that Bryant's patience seems to
have fluttered, particularly with the teammates who can't make an
open shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Their roles have changed now, especially when Shaquille is out,"
Bryant said Tuesday night. "When Shaquille's playing, him and I
usually combine for 60, 65 points. But now the pressure has shifted
to them somewhat. They need to feel the responsibility of that and
not take it lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they know. I think they know. It's a responsibility. You
know, I think we're letting each other down. Shots aren't falling.
Obviously I'm going to continue to draw and pitch, continue to get it
to them, continue to come to them. That's the only way to build a
solid team. We're obviously playing in June, not playing for now. So,
I'm going to keep coming to them and I told them that. The ball's
going to go down for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Through Tuesday's games, Bryant led the league in field-goal
attempts and was sixth in free-throw attempts.... Bryant also ranks
first in what the NBA calls its "efficiency rating," a formula that
considers most statistical categories. He is just ahead of Steve
Francis and Tracy McGrady.</TE>

<LD>Bobbin Lee, a 6-year-old Ole' mare, will try for her fifth win in a
row in tonight's third, a 4 1/2-furlong race for $5,000 fillies and
mares.</LD>
<LD>   Reclaimed by owner-trainer Zvi Kriple for $3,200 out of her last
race -- a six-length victory Sept. 26 -- Bobbin Lee will be taking on
another recent winner, Silky Goose, in the first leg of a pick six
with a modest $8,656 carry-over.</LD>
<LD>   Silky Goose, owned by Jose Avila and Adan Farias and trained by
Farias, comes off a four-length win over $2,500 claimers Oct. 20. She
gets a confident boost in class in going for her ninth victory in 19
starts and retains regular rider Ramon Guce.</LD>
<TE>   Farias, winning at around 20% for the meet, has contenders in two
other pick six races. In the sixth for $8,000 claimers at 350 yards,
Farias sends Classic Hat Trick -- claimed for $6,250 in an Oct. 18
race in which he was second. In the seventh for $20,000 claimers at
300 yards, he runs Talking Tactics -- a winner of 12 races. Rodrigo
Aceves will ride Classic Hat Trick and Talking Tactics.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Hi Karate Aftershave. 2. Offeredherhonor. 3. Silky
Goose. 4. La Flaire. 5. Billy Bob Dave. 6. Fly Jimmy Fly. 7. Talking
Tactics. 8. Rhymer.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Hi Karate Aftershave and Victory Red in the first,
Bobbiesdashinfavorite and Offeredherhonor in the second, Silky Goose
in the third and First Temptation, La Flaire, Zelmas Treasure and
This Chicks A Dasher in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Master Cowboy Jazz tries lesser competition in
the fifth. Miami Moon Dust came back running for trainer Paul Jones
and could repeat in the sixth.</TE>

<HD>Arizona's Mackovic Vows to Change His Approach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Arizona football Coach John Mackovic, his voice choking with emotion
Wednesday, admitted major mistakes in dealing with his players and
assistants.</LD>
<LD>   Mackovic, however, said he would not resign and pledged to do a
better job in the future.</LD>
<LD>   He has three years remaining on a contract that pays him $800,000
per year.</LD>
<TE>   Arizona is 0-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference for the first time in
its 25 years in the league. The Wildcats are 3-7 with two games
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   They are 8-13, 2-12 in the Pac-10 under Mackovic, who replaced
Dick Tomey on Dec. 4, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic, 59, met with his players for 90 minutes Wednesday
afternoon and allowed them to air their grievances with him.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 players met with school President Peter Likins on
Tuesday night -- without Mackovic's knowledge -- to reportedly voice
their concerns about the coach.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Mackovic apologized for remarks he had made
to some players, including telling a player that he "was a disgrace
to his family" by the way he had performed.</TE>
<TE>   That player was tight end Justin Levasseur.</TE>
<TE>   "He just said something about my family that I didn't appreciate.
He apologized for it," Levasseur said. "A little late, but he did
apologize."</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic said the comment came after Arizona's 31-10 loss at
Wisconsin on Sept. 21, and he had "allowed it to fester since then."</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats, who have lost 17 of their last 19 Pac-10 games, play
at California on Saturday and end the season against Arizona State on
Nov. 29 at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic was hired by Arizona after coaching stints at Texas,
Illinois and Wake Forest. He coached the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs
from 1983-86 and was an assistant with the Dallas Cowboys in 1981-82.</TE>

<HD>Dallas Keeps Rolling Along</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already off to a great start, the Dallas Mavericks showed they can
finish pretty well too.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas extended the league's best record, improving to 8-0 by
rallying in the second half to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers,
103-99, Wednesday night at Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   "Teams that are championship caliber win the ugly ones," guard
Avery Johnson said. "We found a way."</LD>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki scored 13 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter for
the Mavericks, who trailed by 13 points in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Finley scored a season-high 26 points for Dallas, which
had to overcome a career-high 34 points by Zydrunas Ilgauskas and a
dunk by 6-foot-7 guard Ricky Davis on which he jumped over Steve
Nash.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who was kept out of the starting lineup while being
disciplined by Coach John Lucas, took off in the middle of the lane
and soared over the 6-3 Nash's head before slamming the ball in to
give the Cavaliers a 91-89 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have blocked it," Nash joked.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas went eight for eight from the free-throw line in the last
55 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Davis didn't start for the first time this season as punishment
for an on-court squabble with teammate Bimbo Coles and Lucas during
Tuesday night's game at Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 91, Philadelphia 81 -- Antoine Walker scored 20 points at
Boston and the Celtics won their sixth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce, who missed 16 of 20 shots, made a three-point basket
to start a 13-0 run by the Celtics that turned a six-point
third-quarter deficit into a 72-65 fourth-quarter lead.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson had 25 points and Eric Snow had 13 assists for the
76ers, who are 0-3 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 91, San Antonio 82 -- Lucious Harris broke open a close
game by making his first three shots of the fourth quarter, Richard
Jefferson scored a career-high 27 points and the Nets improved to 5-0
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 21 points, Stephen Jackson had a season-high 20
points and David Robinson had 14 rebounds for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, a backup shooting guard, scored 12 of his 15 points in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 108, Chicago 101 -- Michael Redd scored a season-high 24
points and the Bucks blew a 25-point lead before rallying in the
fourth quarter at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Allen had 19 points and Kevin Ollie had a season-high 14
points to give Milwaukee its ninth consecutive victory over the Bulls
at the Bradley Center.</TE>
<TE>   Jalen Rose scored 24 points for Chicago and rookie Jay Williams
had 20.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 102, Minnesota 98 -- Courtney Alexander scored 11 of
his 23 points in the fourth quarter and the Hornets improved to 5-0
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander made his 10 free throws, eight of them in the fourth
quarter. He made a three-pointer from the corner to tie the score,
94-94, with just over two minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Mashburn had 25 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, and
Baron Davis scored 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 75, Denver 72 -- Stephon Marbury scored 19 points,
including 10 in the pivotal third quarter when the Suns outscored the
Nuggets, 29-11, to erase a nine-point halftime deficit at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Juwan Howard led Denver with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 104, Golden State 93 -- Chris Webber had 33 points,
seven rebounds and two technical fouls without getting ejected at
Oakland, and the Kings beat the Warriors for the 11th consecutive
time.</TE>
<TE>   Webber got two technical fouls in the second half -- the second
for hanging on the rim after a ferocious dunk. He didn't get thrown
out because of a new rule that says certain types of technicals don't
mandate ejections.</TE>

secret deal to circumvent the NBA salary cap.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed Tuesday by Elbert Crawford in California
Superior Court in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that in 1999 the Kings promised Williamson a

<LD>The St. Louis Rams aren't ruling Marshall Faulk out of Monday night's
game against Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The All-Pro running back left Sunday's game against San Diego
because of a sprained left ankle and a strained tendon in his right
foot, and was on crutches Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But Faulk was feeling much better Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody heals like he does," Coach Mike Martz said.</TE>
<TE>   Martz said Faulk, listed as questionable, probably won't practice
at least until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be pessimistic at this point and say he won't be ready,"
Martz said. "If he is ready, it'll be a surprise, and that's how
we'll prepare.</TE>
<TE>   "He's improved quite a bit, so we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle receiver Darrell Jackson was back at practice, nearly
three weeks after suffering a postgame seizure at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was hit hard on the head by safety Darren Woodson, who was
fined $75,000 by the NFL. Jackson might play against Kansas City on
Nov. 24.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Chris Chandler will start for Chicago against the
Rams, although the Bears still are not sure who's going to snap the
ball to him.</TE>
<TE>   Center Olin Kreutz had an appendectomy Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler strained his neck on a fourth-down sneak Sunday but said
the pain had diminished. Jim Miller, who began the season as the
Bears' starting quarterback, has been slowed by tendinitis in his
throwing elbow and shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis running back Edgerrin James, who has been sidelined
the last two games because of a hamstring injury and damaged rib
cartilage, returned to practice and might be able to play against
Dallas on Sunday.... Detroit kick returner Desmond Howard will be out
for the season because of a neck injury. The Lions claimed receiver
Jacquez Green, who was waived by Washington on Tuesday.... Cleveland
running back Jamel White will not play against Cincinnati on Sunday
because of a separated right shoulder.... San Diego tackle Vaughn
Parker had surgery on his left triceps and will be out for at least
Sunday's game against San Francisco.</TE>

<TE>   Carol Vermeil, the 66-year-old wife of Kansas City Coach Dick
Vermeil, struggled with a thief who got away with her billfold
Tuesday afternoon in a fashionable shopping district in Kansas City,
Mo.</TE>

<TE>   A judge ordered Washington offensive lineman Rod Jones to pay a
Cincinnati jewelry store $16,854 for a diamond-encrusted,
football-shaped pendant that the player said he never ordered.</TE>
<TE>   A store employee showed a receipt he said Jones had signed as a
promise to pay for the pendant he ordered in 2000 while with the
Cincinnati Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the receipt was a forgery or had been altered.</TE>

<HD>Thrashers No Longer in League's Basement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Get this: The Atlanta Thrashers aren't the worst team in the NHL
anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Slava Kozlov scored with 2:41 remaining in overtime Wednesday
night at Atlanta, giving the Thrashers a 3-2 victory over the San
Jose Sharks and only the second three-game winning streak in
franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta is 4-0-1-1 in its last six games after starting the season
with nine straight losses. The Thrashers have 10 points, one more
than the Buffalo Sabres.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we have this thing turned around now," said Pasi
Nurminen, who made 22 saves and has been in goal for all four of
Atlanta's victories. "It's been a different team the past few games.
The team is working real hard now -- very solid defense, no big
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Kozlov's third goal of the season was set up by Andy Sutton, who
circled behind the net and almost back to the blue line before
flipping a pass in front. Kozlov's quick backhander was stopped by
Evgeni Nabokov, but the rebound came right back to Kozlov, who
snapped a wrist shot into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy made it happen," Kozlov said. "He beat three guys. They just
followed him and I was in front of the net."</TE>
<TE>   Owen Nolan forced overtime by scoring for San Jose with only 2:40
left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 6, Washington 1 -- Bill Guerin ended a seven-game goal
drought with two second-period goals for the Stars at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Young, Pierre Turgeon, Brenden Morrow and Jere Lehtinen also
scored for Dallas, which has won four of five. The six goals marked a
season high for the Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Star center Mike Modano had two assists and is one point shy of
becoming the 64th player in NHL history and fifth U.S.-born player to
reach 1,000 points in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Kip Miller scored for Washington, which was bidding for a
season-high fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 1, Florida 1 -- Kristian Huselius had a goal and Jani
Hurme stopped 29 shots as the Panthers tied the Flyers at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers are winless in their last three games, yet are off to a
9-3-3 start under new Coach Ken Hitchcock.</TE>

<LD>Detroit Red Wing defenseman Jiri Fischer will be sidelined from four
to six months with a knee injury that will require surgery.</LD>
<LD>   He has a torn anterior cruciate ligament and will be operated on

<KH>Robyn Norwood ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL</KH>
<HD>At the Starting Point, Olson Is King of the Mountain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lute Olson's mountaintop experience came on a hillside in Italy.</LD>
<LD>   He is a newly minted member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball
Hall of Fame and his Arizona team is No. 1 in the preseason poll for
the third time in six years.</LD>
<LD>   But on the night of his Hall of Fame induction in Springfield,
Mass., in September, Olson was in Positano, Italy, with his family,
preparing for the wedding of his son Steve.</LD>
<TE>   Somewhere amid the five big family dinners -- one on a beach
accessible only by boat, one al fresco on a mountainside, another in
the little town the bride is from -- Olson and the wedding party
tried to tune in for his Friday night induction.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not find ESPN Classic anywhere," Olson said, laughing.
"I had to call somebody the next day to find out what had gone on."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Newell presented Olson in Springfield, and Olson delivered
his acceptance speech by videotape, thanking 46 seasons' worth of
players and calling his late wife Bobbi "truly the Hall of Famer in
our family."</TE>
<TE>   Next fall, Olson, his five children and their families will attend
the induction ceremony together as he receives special recognition
alongside the class of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   By then, some people figure he might have added a second NCAA
championship to the one Arizona won in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I think now that he's in the Hall of Fame, he wants to get
another national championship," said Jason Gardner, the senior point
guard. "Not too many get to say they even have one. I think he wants
to collect national titles."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona entered last season unranked with one starter back from a
Final Four team, but defeated eventual national champion Maryland in
the first game. The Wildcats have every starter back from that team,
which went 24-10 and reached the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, frankly, it was a really stressful off-season," Olson
said.</TE>
<TE>   This season, seniors Luke Walton and Gardner are first-team
preseason All-Americans. Along with Rick Anderson, they give Olson a
three-senior nucleus now rare among college teams. Sophomores Salim
Stoudamire and Channing Frye are the other returning starters on a
deep roster bolstered by the addition of Hassan Adams, a freshman
guard from Westchester High.</TE>
<TE>   That is plenty to make Arizona the preseason No. 1, just as the
Wildcats were before the 1997-98 and 2000-2001 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   One difference: The Wildcats are well aware how little that means.</TE>
<TE>   "People were talking about an undefeated season [in 2000-01] and
us being one of the best teams ever to play college basketball before
we'd even played a game," said Gardner, a starter on that 28-8 team
that lost to Duke in the NCAA title game.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of things come to mind," Olson said. "One, I've always
said to win the national championship you have to be very, very good
and very, very lucky. You have to avoid key injuries and illness at
the wrong time. And rarely does the preseason No. 1 end up winning
the national championship."</TE>
<TE>   Still, together with the Hall of Fame induction, the expectations
for this team put Olson, 68, at the pinnacle of his career.</TE>
<TE>   That he reached this point without Bobbi, who died of cancer in
January 2001, is particularly poignant.</TE>
<TE>   In his induction speech, Olson called it "the most difficult thank
you."</TE>
<TE>   "Bobbi was the real head coach, the No. 1 recruiter and the team
mom," he said. "Every player who has ever played for me knows these
things to be true."</TE>
<TE>   Bobbi also was close to her family's thoughts at the wedding of
Steve, a chef trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and Sandra
Belcredi, a publisher and stepdaughter of an Italian diplomat. She
also had lost her mother as well as her stepfather in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a really tough week from the emotional standpoint of Bobbi
not being there, and Sandra was very, very close to her mother,"
Olson said. "She said to me at one of the dinners, 'This was truly a
wedding made in heaven.' She was sure, knowing how close she and her
mom were, and knowing how close Steve and Bobbi were, they were
probably up there planning to make sure these two got together."</TE>
<TE>   After the wedding, high on a hillside, most of the guests took
vehicles down to the reception.</TE>
<TE>   "But the tradition is for the males, all the men and good friends
on both sides, to walk the bride through the streets down to where
the reception is," Olson said. "It's the side of a mountain, so it
was quite a walk, and Positano isn't very big, so everyone in town
knew what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   For that, they didn't even need ESPN Classic.</TE>
<TE>   The Big 12's Big Three</TE>
<TE>   Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas are No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 in the
preseason poll, making the Big 12 the first conference other than the
Atlantic Coast ever to have three teams in the preseason top five.</TE>
<TE>   The ACC did it twice, before the 1973-74 season with No. 2 North
Carolina State, No. 4 Maryland and No. 5 North Carolina, and before
the 1997-98 season with No. 3 Duke, No. 4 North Carolina and No. 5
Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole league from top to bottom is the strongest that it has
ever been," said Kansas Coach Roy Williams, who has three starters
back from a Final Four team. "Regardless of who you play and where
you play, it's going to be a struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Team to keep an eye on: Texas Tech, with Andre Emmett leading four
starters back from Bob Knight's first team in Lubbock, which went
23-9 and lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Number to watch: Knight's victory total.</TE>
<TE>   He is 13 victories from No. 800, where he would join Dean Smith
(879), Adolph Rupp (876), Clarence  "Big House" Gaines (828) and Jim
Phelan, who has 819 victories and is still coaching at Mount St.
Mary's in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   The math is easy: Even if Knight, 62, averages 20 victories a
season, he can pass Smith in less than five seasons, and he easily
could reach the record in four.</TE>
<TE>   10 Games to Watch</TE>
<TE>   Some key nonconference games:</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma vs. Alabama, today -- Top-10 matchup tips off the season
at Coaches vs. Cancer Classic in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Texas vs. Georgia, Friday -- Players to watch in another Coaches
vs. Cancer game: Texas point guard T.J. Ford, Georgia swingman Jarvis
Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA vs. Duke, Nov. 30 -- Blue Devils lost Jason Williams, Mike
Dunleavy and Carlos Boozer. Here's a look at bumper crop of freshmen
at Wooden Tradition in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana vs. Maryland, Dec. 3 -- A rematch of the teams that played
in last year's NCAA championship game, a 64-52 Maryland victory. This
one, however, will be played in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier vs. Cincinnati, Dec. 7 -- City rivals -- and two top-25
teams -- clash in Skyline Chili Crosstown Shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas at Oregon, Dec. 7 -- The two Lukes, Ridnour and Jackson,
take another shot at Jayhawk team that beat them in NCAA Elite Eight.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky at North Carolina, Dec. 7 -- Tar Heel point guard Raymond
Felton -- possibly the nation's top freshman -- tries to bail out
North Carolina and Coach Matt Doherty after hideous 8-20 season.</TE>
<TE>   Florida at Maryland, Dec. 14 -- With Juan Dixon and Chris Wilcox
in the NBA, Terrapins try to prove that they belong in top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Texas at Arizona, Dec. 15 -- At the moment, this would be a
top-five clash: No. 1 Arizona vs. No. 4 Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona at Kansas, Jan. 25 -- This might be a No. 1 vs. No. 2
matchup -- and for once, with no sign of Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The Outsiders</TE>
<TE>   Which teams will crack college basketball's inner circle this
season?</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga flamed out with a first-round NCAA tournament loss to
Wyoming and has lost high-scoring guard Dan Dickau, but the Zags will
have one of the nation's best front lines in Cory Violette, Zach
Gourde and Ronny Turiaf.</TE>
<TE>   More stunning: A study of the nation's top programs over the last
decade by Jack Styczynski in Basketball Times rates Gonzaga No. 8,
trailing only Duke, Stanford, Kansas, Michigan State, North Carolina,
Arizona and Xavier and ahead of Utah and Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   The criteria included winning percentage, number of former players
in the NBA, graduation rate, academic reputation, coaching and the
"cleanliness" of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Other nontraditional programs that could be in the mix are Western
Kentucky, with 7-footer Chris Marcus back from foot injury to try to
parlay a stronger season into a spot among the NBA lottery picks, as
well as Wyoming and Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   Mid-major threats: Creighton and Ball State.</TE>

<LD>I was scheduled to speak to the Trojan Club of the San Fernando
Valley and Ventura County on Wednesday night, and I mention this for
the benefit of local authorities, if there's concern today about my
whereabouts.</LD>
<LD>   I know it got lost in the dramatic headlines at the time, but if I
remember correctly, Jimmy Hoffa was going to lunch, and then on to
speak to the Detroit Trojan Club when he turned up missing.</LD>
<LD>   In preparation for Wednesday night's bash, the Trojan Club passed
out fliers, which included the following note: "All ripe fruit, eggs
and other throwable items must be checked at the front door. Airport
security will seem like child's play compared to the security
surrounding the appearance of our guest speaker. There may be minors
present, so objectionable language is not permitted."</LD>
<TE>   That last part about "objectionable language" not being permitted
raises the question, how will Trojan fans be able to communicate? I'm
guessing sign language.</TE>
<TE>   Last week I was an invited guest of the Orange County Youth Sports
Foundation Tribute for horse trainer Bob Baffert, and when I was
introduced, a man who later identified himself as a USC graduate
shouted an obscenity.</TE>
<TE>   I hear that same obscenity from a lot of USC graduates, and in
some cases it's the most intelligent thing they have to say.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TROJAN Club flier, which was designed to draw a crowd, called
me the "irrepressible, irreverent, irrational, irresponsible and
often irritating" columnist for The Times, and while they obviously
have me mixed up with Diane Pucin, you might be wondering why I'd
insist on throwing myself into harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Did I mention I get a free chicken dinner (and a night away from
the wife's cooking)? Now I pity the poor UCLA waiter who will have to
taste that chicken first, but I remain on a lifelong quest to find a
reasonable, sensible Trojan supporter who keeps things in perspective
and doesn't walk around angry all the time.</TE>
<TE>   I mean, they're the ones driving the BMWs -- why are they angry?</TE>
<TE>   These should be the very best of times for USC and Trojan fans,
you know, before UCLA or Notre Dame ruins all the fun, and that's
what my upbeat, positive speech was going to be all about when I
stepped before the Trojan Club of the San Fernando Valley and Ventura
County on Wednesday night: Enjoy it while you can.</TE>
<TE>   I just hope I get the chance later this week to tell you how it
went.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI OF Ohio has suspended two coaches -- one for knocking down a
fan and sending him to the hospital after Miami lost to Marshall, and
the other for trashing the coaches' booth in the press box after
Tuesday night's game. I suspect these are two guys who as youngsters
played for high school coaches who demanded they be quiet and act
angry while riding the bus home after a defeat. I just hate to think
of the path of destruction they'd leave behind if they were coaching
the Arizona Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KNOWING HOW stingy sports editor Bill Dwyre is with the budget
around here, I still like a woman's chances of being admitted to
Augusta before I ever get to the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW WHEN I tell you the Dodgers' lineup for next season is scary
already, you know what I mean. It would be nice to change the meaning
of that sentence, however, and add "Godzilla" to the attack --
Japan's Hideki Matsui, a .334 hitter who hit 50 homers this year and
who is expected to sign with a major league team.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have indicated they don't have the money to improve
their lineup this season, and now the New York Yankees look as if
they'll end up with Godzilla. That leaves the Dodgers with an unhappy
Brian Jordan, who has asked to be traded, and I'm scared to death
they won't find any takers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DODGER MANAGER Jim Tracy studied under the tutelage of Felipe Alou
in Montreal, and now that Alou has been named manager of the San
Francisco Giants, I worry that Alou might continue to school Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN THEY present the Gold Glove to Darin Erstad, they ought to
make him dive to get it -- that's how I picture him making every
catch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GENERAL MANAGER for the Indianapolis Ice admitted the deal to
sign 7-foot-7 Manute Bol to play hockey is only to generate interest
in the team and sell tickets. And I thought it was to hype hockey in
Bol's native Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF THE NBA playoffs began today, the Clippers would be in and the
Lakers would be out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ESPN REPORTED that "Around the Horn" has improved the rating for
the 2 p.m. PST time slot 65% compared to the comparable six-day
period a year ago when no one was watching "Unscripted." Among the
male 18-34 demographics, the rating has improved 132%. Imagine how
well the show would do if it was any good.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A TV station in Indianapolis reported that Colt owner Jim Irsay is
being investigated by federal and local authorities for prescription
drug fraud. The team denied Irsay is under scrutiny, but Irsay said
he has had a prescription drug problem and sought help from a
treatment center outside of Indiana. This raises the question,
however, whether Irsay is more interested in moving the Colts here to
get a new stadium or to be just closer to Mexico.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States and Canada scored 2-0 victories over Haiti and El
Salvador, respectively, as regional qualifying play began Wednesday
in Charleston, S.C., for the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in
the United Arab Emirates.</LD>
<LD>   The top two finishers in the four-nation group will advance to the
March world championship. Mexico and Panama qualified earlier from
another four-team group.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. took the lead in the 26th minute when Dallas Burn striker
Eddie Johnson controlled a Justin Mapp pass from the left wing with
his chest, then fired the ball past Haitian goalkeeper Ronel St.
Louis from 14 yards.</LD>
<TE>   It was Johnson's defense-splitting pass that paved the way for the
second U.S. goal, scored in the 43rd minute by D.C. United forward
Santino Quaranta. Later in the match, Quaranta broke the small finger
on his left hand, leaving his status in doubt for Friday's game with
El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Newcastle United of England, Deportivo La Coruna of Spain and
Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia secured the final three places in the
second round of the European Champions League.</TE>
<TE>   Newcastle did so in history-making fashion, becoming the first
club to lose its first three [of eight first-round] games and still
reach the final 16. A goal by Welsh striker Craig Bellamy in injury
time earned Coach Bobby Robson's team a 3-2 victory over Feyenoord in
Rotterdam and knocked the Dutch team out of the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Lokomotiv advanced by defeating Bruges of Belgium, 2-0, while
Deportivo clinched its place with a 2-1 victory over AC Milan in
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The draw dividing the final 16 teams into four groups of four for
second-round play will be held Friday in Geneva, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Schiaffino Dies</TE>
<TE>   Striker Juan A. Schiaffino, whose second-half goal in the 1950
World Cup final helped Uruguay to a 2-1 upset victory over host
Brazil in front of an estimated 199,000 fans at Maracana Stadium in
Rio de Janeiro, has died at age 78.</TE>
<TE>   His death was confirmed by officials at Penarol, his former club
in Uruguay, but no other details were released. Regarded as one of
his country's top forwards in the 1940s and 1950s, Schiaffino later
played for AC Milan in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Coelho to China?</TE>
<TE>   China is considering hiring former Portugal national team coach
Humberto Coelho as a replacement for Bora Milutinovic, who coached
China into the World Cup for the first time but resigned after
Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Coelho, who led Portugal to the semifinals of the European
Championship in 2000 and later coached Morocco, met with Chinese
soccer federation officials in Paris on Wednesday, according to the
Portuguese daily newspaper A Bola.</TE>
<TE>   Lazio for Sale</TE>
<TE>   One of Italy's most prestigious clubs, Lazio of Rome, was put up
for sale by the company that owns a 51% stake in the team.</TE>
<TE>   Cirio, a canned foods company with operations in Brazil, Greece,
Portugal and South Africa, as well as Italy, has defaulted on more
than $150 million in bonds and trading in the company's shares has
been suspended.</TE>
<TE>   It is restructuring in order to get out of debt, and selling the
Serie A team is one of the moves recommended by bankers.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Farewell</TE>
<TE>   Newly acquired Galaxy defender Hong Myung-Bo was one of 20 players
selected by acting coach Kim Ho-Kon to play for South Korea in a Nov.
20 game against Brazil at Seoul World Cup Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The game will mark the final national team appearance for striker
Hwang Sun-Hong and for Hong, who plays for the Pohang Steelers in the
K-League and will join the Galaxy at the end of the Korean season.</TE>

<HD>Fikse Enjoying the Extra Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nate Fikse has pulled triple duty in the past. In high school, for
example, he starred on a club soccer team, played bass guitar in a
jazz band and surfed on weekends.</LD>
<LD>   Less varied but equally remarkable is his workload the last three
weeks for UCLA. Fikse punts, kicks field goals and kicks off. And he
does all three at an admirably high level.</LD>
<LD>   "He's getting a lot of interest from the pros because he can do it
all," Coach Bob Toledo said.</LD>
<TE>   Fikse's work last summer with former Bruin kicker Chris Sailer is
paying off. He has made all 10 of his field-goal attempts since
taking over for Chris Griffith three games ago, including a 51-yarder
last week against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   He is third in the Pacific 10 in punting with a 41.5 average. Only
14 of his last 44 punts have been returned.</TE>
<TE>   And most of his kickoffs are like letters thrown in the mail with
the top left corner blank -- nonreturnable. "Doing all three jobs was
hard the first week I kicked field goals because there was the
anxiety of doing that," Fikse said. "Since then, it hasn't been bad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manuel White was as pleased with his 27 yards rushing against
Arizona as Tyler Ebell was with his 124. White, who returned after
missing four games because of a hamstring injury, displayed his
signature power-running style, carrying several defenders on a
nine-yard run and scoring on a one-yard plunge.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt great just to play," he said. "And the more carries I
got, the better it was. I enjoyed blocking too. I just enjoyed the
contact."</TE>
<TE>   White should play more against USC. He is listed as the starting
fullback on the depth chart. "He is trying just to get his legs back,
but when he got his hands on the ball, he was trying to make up for
some lost time," Toledo said.</TE>

<DH>Finally free of illness and injury, Grootegoed is thriving
at linebacker for USC</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Grootegoed can hardly believe it.</LD>
<LD>   Nine games into what might become USC's finest season in years, he
is not only standing but also healthfully thriving as the strong-side
linebacker for the eighth-ranked Trojans.</LD>
<LD>   "I just hope I don't jinx myself," Grootegoed said this week.</LD>
<TE>   There is reason for caution. Illness and injury laid out
Grootegoed like a crack-back block during his first two years at USC.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 season ended for Grootegoed almost as soon as it began
when he was diagnosed with mononucleosis after the first game.
Shoulder injuries and a pinched nerve in his neck plagued him last
season. A broken leg finished it.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Grootegoed is the leading tackler for a defense that
ranks second in the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Last week against Stanford, he had eight tackles and three of
USC's season-high seven sacks during a 49-17 victory that kept the
Trojans in the race for the Rose Bowl or another bowl championship
series game.</TE>
<TE>   USC plays Arizona State on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Things just happen when he's on the field," USC Coach Pete
Carroll said. "He knocks the ball down, knocks the ball loose, forces
plays in the backfield and makes unusual plays getting off blocks.
You can't hold him down."</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed, a converted safety who starred at Santa Ana Mater Dei
High, is small for a linebacker. Generously listed at 5 feet 11 and
weighing 210 pounds, he routinely lines up across from tight ends
five or more inches taller and 30 to 40 pounds heavier.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't look like he's super athletic or super strong, but
he's both," Trojan tight end Alex Holmes said. "Plus, he's low to the
ground so he's a much harder guy to block than a taller linebacker."</TE>
<TE>   Quickness and speed also help Grootegoed compensate for size
mismatches.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to make a little move before those big guys can even get
out of their stance," said Grootegoed, who has 11 1/2 tackles for
losses. "It gives me an edge so they can't get their hands on me."</TE>
<TE>   Like All-American strong safety Troy Polamalu, Grootegoed rarely
displays emotion after his bone-jarring hits in the backfield. The
public policy and management major shies from public displays or
pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   "He's quieter than a church-house mouse," cornerback Darrell
Rideaux said. "But he's definitely a presence on the field."</TE>
<TE>   There were times during the last two years when Grootegoed
wondered if he would ever again take the field for the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed's health problems at USC started before the first game
of the 2000 season when the Trojans traveled to East Rutherford,
N.J., to play Penn State in the Kickoff Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had the flu, but I didn't tell anybody because I
didn't want to be the guy who gets sick before his first college
game," Grootegoed said.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after playing on special teams during the Trojans'
victory, Grootegoed blacked out in the locker room after running
sprints. His temperature hit 104 and blood tests revealed
mononucleosis. He was sidelined for two months then declared out for
the season when more tests revealed an enlarged spleen.</TE>
<TE>   "I came back for winter conditioning and it was like, 'Who is this
guy?' " he said. "Some of the guys were calling me Ghost because I
was gone and then just showed up again."</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed played safety behind Polamalu during spring practice in
2001 but was asked by Carroll to move to strongside linebacker during
fall training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "They needed to find a way to get him onto the field," middle
linebacker Mike Pollard said.</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed said the transition was easy until the games began. He
suffered a left shoulder sprain in the second week against Kansas
State and missed the next two games. When he came back, he played
despite an injured right shoulder and pinched nerve in his neck that
prevented him from lifting weights and maintaining his strength.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was feeling strong against California last Nov. 10 when
he penetrated into the backfield to make a play and suffered a broken
right leg. Grootegoed watched the UCLA game and the Las Vegas Bowl
from a wheelchair on the sideline, sat out spring practice and could
not attempt to run at full speed until training camp began in August.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Carroll and others told me to just fight through the pain,
so that's what I did," Grootegoed said. "It takes a good half-hour to
warm up that leg, but after that it feels fine."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu said playing with Grootegoed, "is like having a twin on
the other side of the field." The Thorpe Award candidate said
Grootegoed will shine next season if he is allowed to return to
strong safety.</TE>
<TE>   "He's better than I am, he just hasn't had the platform yet,"
Polamalu said. "As soon as he gets it, everybody is going to see
because he has everything it takes."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, however, said there are no plans to move Grootegoed back
into the secondary.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so far along with what he's doing and so good at it, we
couldn't afford to take all that experience away from the position,"
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed said he will play wherever the Trojans need him next
season.</TE>
<TE>   But with so much riding on the next three games, he is concerned
only about maintaining his high level of play throughout this one.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's luck," he said. "I'm not changing anything or trying
to do anything crazy. I'm just playing more freely. I'm not scared to
make mistakes anymore. I'm confident."</TE>

Wednesday, the first day of the early signing period, to play at USC.
They will join current Trojan twins Derrick and Errick Craven.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-5, 200-pound Rodrick, who plays point and shooting
guard, is a preseason McDonald's All-American after averaging 19.4
points and 6.0 assists. The 6-5, 210-pound Lodrick, an alternate
All-American who plays shooting guard and small forward, averaged
17.8 points and 9.0 rebounds.</LD>

<LD>With USC's offensive line suddenly short-handed because of injury,
Fred Matua again saw his status change Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Matua, a freshman from Wilmington who was on track to start the
season opener at right guard, was expected to redshirt after having
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Oct. 3.</LD>
<LD>   But when left guard Lenny Vandermade decided Tuesday to have
surgery for a torn tendon in his right biceps, Matua was thrust back
into several possible scenarios.</LD>
<TE>   Said USC Coach Pete Carroll: "I wouldn't put him in just to put
him in. I'd put him in to play a lot and count on him to help us win.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll wait till the end of the week to figure it out."</TE>
<TE>   Matua was injured before the opener against Auburn but played in
that game and briefly against Kansas State. He said he would give up
a redshirt season to help the Trojans down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, you don't want to be selfish," Matua said. "There's no
more linemen left. When someone goes down, I have to step up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my choice anymore. It's for the team now. If you want to
go all the way, you sacrifice for the team."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Eric Torres will start for Vandermade against Arizona
State, but he is also the primary backup for tackles Winston Justice
and Jacob Rogers. If either player were injured, Torres would move to
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he would possibly replace Torres by moving center
Norm Katnik to guard and replacing him with senior Derek Graf, who
started the opener at right guard.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt sophomore Travis Watkins could also play guard if
necessary, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Mike Williams, nursing a sprained left ankle, made it
through most of practice and is expected to play against Arizona
State.... Reserve cornerback William Buchanon did not practice again
because of a neck strain and Carroll said he was comfortable with
freshman Justin Wyatt playing in his place.... USC's game against
Notre Dame on Nov. 30 at the Coliseum is sold out.... Carson Palmer
is among 14 semifinalists for the Davey O'Brien award, presented to
the nation's top quarterback. Finalists will be announced Dec. 2.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Nothing Is Perfectly Clear</HD>
<DH>After Connecticut's unbeaten title run, the women's elite
should include No. 1 Duke, Tennessee and Stanford.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That collective sigh of relief heard around women's college
basketball in June came when Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Asjha Jones and
Tamika Williams graduated and took their acts to the WNBA.</LD>
<LD>   Connecticut's quintessential quartet, along with second-team
All-American guard Diana Taurasi, stormed through last season to a
39-0 record and the Huskies' third national championship.</LD>
<LD>   Taurasi, a junior, is the sole returning starter. Connecticut is
prepared to take some lumps this season -- but only a few -- while it
reloads for another title chase.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, the 2002-03 NCAA championship will have a flock
of pursuers from the Pacific 10, Big 12, Southeastern, Atlantic
Coast, Big Ten and Big East conferences, all thinking this is their
time.</TE>
<TE>   Duke opens the season No. 1 for the first time. The Blue Devils
won 31 games last year, dominated the ACC, and reached the Final Four
with only eight scholarship players and one senior.</TE>
<TE>   All five starters return, including guard Alana Beard -- a
national player-of-the-year candidate -- and center Iciss Tillis.</TE>
<TE>   Duke had a big setback when starting guard Monique Currie was lost
for the season after suffering a torn ligament in her left knee
during an exhibition game. To soften the blow, Coach Gail Goestenkors
can mix in what many think is the nation's top recruiting class.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be interesting," said Goestenkors, when asked how
she would keep everyone motivated. "It's a challenge that I'm looking
forward to deal with. I'd rather have too much talent than too little
talent."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect pedigreed programs such as Tennessee, Vanderbilt,
Stanford, Louisiana State, Purdue and Notre Dame to be too impressed.</TE>
<TE>   The Lady Volunteers, who beat Oklahoma in their season opener,
were flattened twice by Connecticut last season, including the Final
Four.</TE>
<TE>   But it's doubtful the game has passed by Coach Pat Summitt. She
has six national championships and may be in line for a seventh with
four returning starters, including guard Kara Lawson.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is the SEC to navigate. Vanderbilt is coming off a
30-7 season. The Commodores have a new coach (Melanie Balcomb
replaces Jim Foster, who went to Ohio State) and 6-foot-6 center
Chantelle Anderson, expected to be the top WNBA draft pick in April,
back for her senior year. Louisiana State (which convinced high
school star Seimone Augustus to stay in her home state), Georgia and
Arkansas also should contend.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame is taking aim at ending Connecticut's streak of nine
consecutive Big East titles. The Fighting Irish have nearly everyone
back from last season's 20-10 squad, including shooting guard Alicia
Ratay.</TE>
<TE>   The Big 12 had seven top-25 teams last season, led by Oklahoma,
which reached the NCAA title game.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech, which lost its season opener against Louisiana Tech,
is projected as the conference standout with the return of forward
Plenette Pierson.</TE>
<TE>   She'll anchor a lineup with two other double-figure scorers in
guards Jia Perkins and Natalie Ritchie.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech will be pressed in the conference by Kansas State,
Texas and Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue, still fuming over its NCAA second-round ouster by Old
Dominion, could be the class of the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   The Boilermakers, 24-6 last season, have a bona-fide scorer in
forward Shereka Wright and an inside presence in 6-5 center Mary Jo
Noon.</TE>
<TE>   If Purdue stumbles, Minnesota or Penn State -- led by the NCAA's
top scorer, Kelly Mazzante -- could break through.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford probably won't duplicate last year's 32-3 mark,
especially if All-American forward Nicole Powell is sidelined by a
bulging disk in her back. Powell will miss the team's season opener
because she was suspended for playing in a summer league game not
sanctioned by the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   If the Cardinal slips in the Pac-10, look for Washington to
emerge.</TE>
