<HD>Schools Look Abroad for Bilingual Teachers</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>YAKIMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Seventh-grade teacher Diana Weehuizen Beltran's classroom is
decorated with a map and several travel posters from Spain, and her
students ask questions about the island of Mallorca, where her
husband's family has a restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   She teaches in English, but she can explain the mysteries of
parallelograms and quadrilaterals in Spanish too.</LD>
<LD>   Beltran is one of hundreds of teachers recruited from abroad as
U.S. schools search for teachers who can speak the languages of an
increasingly diverse student body. The Yakima, Kent and Tacoma
districts in Washington state have brought 21 teachers from Spain in
the last three years.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a shortage of qualified bilingual teachers," said
Eduardo Tobar, who coordinates the teacher program between the state
and the government of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The National Education Assn. says Maryland has gone to India,
California to the Philippines, and New York City to Austria for
bilingual teachers. Washington state has recruited from China.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five states work with Spain to import Spanish-speaking
teachers in the program that began 15 years ago in California, Tobar
said. The program now has 1,000 Spanish teachers in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino Educational Achievement Project in Seattle has been
promoting a proposal to develop in middle school--with college
tuition incentives--future bilingual teachers who speak any language
in addition to English.</TE>
<TE>   But project director Ricardo Sanchez said he believes that
importing teachers is an acceptable way to address the language needs
of immigrant students, who could miss out on the fundamentals of
education while they learn to speak English.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to credit the school districts for doing something," he
said. "I think they're setting the trend."</TE>
<TE>   The NEA, the nation's largest teachers union, says it would like
to see school districts recruit at home, providing training and
mentoring to talented people interested in becoming teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "In a country as diverse as ours, there is no shortage of people
who are Spanish speaking," NEA spokeswoman Melinda Anderson said in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is less one of a teacher shortage than of teacher
retention, and that's the problem that needs to be addressed, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The districts are looking for shortcuts that won't pay off in the
long run," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, there were fears that importing teachers would take
away local jobs, but the need is greater than can be addressed at
home, said Ben Soria, superintendent of the 14,400-student Yakima
School District.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge need in the Yakima Valley for bilingual teachers,"
he said. "We need some major help."</TE>
<TE>   Beltran, 44, moved with her husband and two teenage daughters last
year from the Mallorca town of Palma to this central Washington city
to teach math, language arts and reading.</TE>
<TE>   She had never been to the United States, but she wanted to see
Washington's Mount St. Helens volcano, which erupted in 1980, and she
was eager for her daughters to learn English and experience a
different culture.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually teach in English, but to the Hispanic kids, I speak in
Spanish for their individual work," Beltran said.</TE>
<TE>   "I found out at the beginning of the year some of the kids didn't
want to speak in Spanish. They felt a bit ashamed of speaking in
Spanish. But then they found out it was a nice thing to speak in the
mother language."</TE>
<TE>   When Spain exports its teachers, it saves their jobs, anticipating
they'll return with new ideas and skills, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are copying your educational system," Beltran said. "You are
10 years ahead of us."</TE>
<TE>   The teachers can stay in the United States for up to three years,
but not all of them do. Beltran hasn't decided whether she will teach
a second year.</TE>
<TE>   Soria has also recruited informally in Mexico and hopes an
agreement similar to the one with Spain can be made to import
additional teachers.</TE>

<HD>Welfare Recipients Get a Lift</HD>
<DH>Jobs: A Ventura County program helps them move off public
aid by allowing them to buy a car and become more self-sufficient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years on welfare, Corrina Arenas finally had a job. What she
didn't have was a reliable way to get to it.</LD>
<LD>   That was when the government stepped in to help the Oxnard mother
of six. Working with a nonprofit agency, Ventura County social
workers steered Arenas to a 1989 Nissan Maxima. The county also used
public dollars to back her $3,000 car loan.</LD>
<LD>   All of this seemed miraculous to Arenas--she had a spotty credit
history and little income. But getting the bank's nod, and three days
later, a car, helped the 42-year-old counselor get off public aid.</LD>
<TE>   In the two years since, Arenas has moved on to a better vehicle
and an even better job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole different life now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's car ownership program, started four years ago, is
being imitated in various forms across the state. Stringent federal
requirements for moving people off welfare rolls are forcing CalWORKS
administrators to fill the gap for those who don't have their own car
and can't use public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything we possibly can to make it a successful
work environment for parents so they can become self-sufficient,"
said June Marcott, deputy director of Orange County's CalWORKS
program.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's Board of Supervisors recently approved a program
similar to Ventura County's and will spend $500,000 a year to back
the loans. Sacramento and San Joaquin counties have taken the idea
one step further, handing over aging county fleet vehicles at no
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "In Sacramento County, we're spread out so far that public
transportation is not an option for some people," said Kerri Aiello,
spokeswoman for the Department of Human Assistance. 'We're looking at
this as a way to help people keep their job and maybe get an even
better job."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, things don't always work out. There was the Ventura
County mother of two who seemed a perfect candidate for a car loan.</TE>
<TE>   She made a few payments on her 1992 Hyundai sedan before skipping
town in the car, leaving the county on the hook for her $2,900 loan.
Another woman claimed a car then high-tailed it to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Loan defaults hover around 20%, said Aurora William of Many
Motors, the nonprofit agency that solicits donated cars and screens
drivers for Ventura County. That compares with about 5% for the
general population.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had to pay off $30,000 in bad debt so far," William said.
Ventura County kicked in about $7,000 of that, but the rest comes
from car sales and donations to the nonprofit group, William said.</TE>
<TE>   Helping welfare parents find a way to work has been a major
obstacle for policymakers trying to trim welfare rolls. A 1998 survey
of employers across the country found that 88% identified
transportation as a problem for newly hired welfare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare departments have offered monthly bus passes, van pools,
gas vouchers and repairs for broken-down cars. But a study released
last fall by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in
Washington, D.C., found that for many welfare dependents, a private
vehicle is the best solution.</TE>
<TE>   A parent with a car is more likely to be employed and to work more
hours, the study found. A reliable car widens their job search and
solves scheduling complications that arise in child care
arrangements, said Heidi Goldberg, author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like car ownership is the most practical option,"
Goldberg said. "If it's a loan program, it also helps them learn how
to save, pay back loans and manage their money."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg says states and counties should replicate these programs,
using federal welfare dollars, instead of focusing on mass transit.
With the Bush administration proposing expanded work requirements for
welfare recipients, there is even more urgency to fix the problem,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some states have already gotten the message and at least 15 offer
cash to lease or purchase a car--California is not one of them. And
county-supported car programs are starting to pop up all over.</TE>
<TE>   The reason why is simple--it works, said Brian Menzies, president
of Charity Cars Inc. His nonprofit group based in Sanford, Fla., has
been giving away donated cars for six years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much smoke and mirrors about bus passes, light rail
and mass transportation," Menzies said. "But the people who own
Lexuses are not going to hop on the bus, are they? So why should a
single mother who's trying to get a job? It's the difference between
having an existence and having a full life."</TE>
<TE>   People donate cars and Menzies' group pays for any repairs.
Participants must have a job, a clean driving record and proof of
insurance. Cars that are salvaged are used to fix up the newer ones
and pay for warranties, Menzies said.</TE>
<TE>   "People will say, 'Why don't you make them give some sweat equity
to earn those cars?' " he said. "Well, I've been poor. I know how
much these people have already suffered. You know what they can do
for me? They can become successful."</TE>
<TE>   Some welfare agencies, however, are putting their own proposals on
hold.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County has suspended its plan until officials see what
the fallout is from the state's projected $20-billion deficit. Los
Angeles County--with the largest welfare population in the state--is
not even considering one.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of low-income people who don't have vehicles whose
lives would be much improved if they had one," said Phillip Ansell, a
spokesman for the county's Department of Public Social Services. "But
there's no way that we have sufficient funding to respond to that
need."</TE>
<TE>   Those counties and others, however, said they will be watching the
programs closely to see how well they succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento and San Joaquin counties' ownership programs are nearly
identical to the Charity Cars program in Florida. The biggest
difference is that the cars are not donated but purchased from the
county's own fleet of vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Pink slips stay in the county's possession for one year. If the
recipient holds down a job and has no driving problems, the county
signs over the title, said Sacramento County's Aiello. The program
costs $250,000 a year, money the county draws from CalWORKS incentive
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento County was swamped with calls after it gave away its
first two cars in January, a 1994 Ford Escort and a 1991 Dodge van,
Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who got the van has five daughters and was so grateful
she was speechless, Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   San Joaquin County has given away 40 cars in the past three years,
said Richard Vote, the Human Service Agency's deputy director. One
mother became an ironworker, joined the union and returned the car to
the county, Vote said.</TE>
<TE>   "She told us to give it to someone who needs it. Then she went out
and bought her own car," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vote said the county tried van pools, but found they didn't work
well because of long distances between job sites. The car giveaways
work best when a parent is motivated to work but has problems getting
to a job, he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Ventura County officials designed their program in 1998, they
had a different model in mind. Supervisors were opposed to just
handing cars over. They also didn't want to commit a lot of taxpayer
dollars to the program.</TE>
<TE>   So the county agreed to back the first few loans that were
approved; after that, the program was handed off to Many Motors to
administer. Advocates say forcing participants to pay for their car
fosters self-respect.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't want charity," said Thousand Oaks-based Supervisor
Frank Schillo, who helped launch the program.</TE>
<TE>   "They really appreciate the fact that they have the ability to buy
a car. That really means something to them. It buys them independence
that they have earned."</TE>
<TE>   For Arenas, the opportunity to get a loan came at just the right
time.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were threatening to take away the youngest of her six
children when she was battling a heroin addiction three years ago.
The scare prompted her to clean up her life.</TE>
<TE>   She was offered a job as a counselor at a battered women's shelter
in Ventura, about seven miles from her home. Riding the bus wouldn't
work, Arenas said, because she had to drop her younger children off
at school and then pick them up at child care at the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Her social worker urged her to fill out an application with Many
Motors. A screening committee disregarded the fact that she had a lot
of unpaid credit card bills and that she had never before taken out a
loan.</TE>
<TE>   After an over-the-phone credit counseling session, the bank
working with Many Motors gave Arenas a check for $3,000. She calls it
"the beginning of my new life."</TE>
<TE>   Now sober for more than three years, Arenas in January was hired
as a drug and alcohol counselor for a county program. She has moved
on to a newer van, but is still making payments on the Maxima.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe $600 now," she said proudly. "I'm supposed to pay it off in
2003, but I'm going to be early."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's program is slightly different because the county
plans to buy the used cars off of lots.</TE>
<TE>   The county also has agreed to pay for the first six months of
insurance and to pay any losses due to loan defaults.</TE>
<TE>   CalWORKS administrators figure they can offer 100 cars a year, at
an average $5,000 price, when the program is launched in July.</TE>
<TE>   Marcott said officials will work closely with parents to make sure
they are making payments. But they are gambling that most will meet
their obligation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we're planning to become the repo police," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we'll talk about that when it happens."</TE>

<HD>High-Speed Train Derails in Britain; 7 Die</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LAWLESS</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>POTTERS BAR, England</DL>
<LD>A high-speed train derailed Friday on its way through a station north
of London and one of its cars crashed onto the platform, scattering
waiting passengers. Seven people were killed in the accident and nine
seriously injured, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   At least 45 others suffered less severe injuries, British
Transport police said, in the sixth fatal accident since 1997 on
Britain's widely criticized rail network.</LD>
<LD>   The northbound London-to-King's Lynn train, carrying 151 people,
went off the tracks in Potters Bar, a quiet suburban town 12 miles
north of London.</LD>
<TE>   It was thought to have been traveling at 100 mph, the regulation
speed on that stretch of track, said Robin Gisbey, spokesman for
Railtrack, which is responsible for rail infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden I saw this train coming toward the platform. The
first thing I did was run," said Andy Perversi, who had been on the
platform with about 25 people.</TE>
<TE>   The train car came to a halt on the platform, lodged under the
station roof.</TE>
<TE>   Perversi said he then saw a woman lying on the rail line.</TE>
<TE>   "I climbed down to help her. I took her pulse, and that was weak,
and I tried to check if she was breathing," he said. "I held her in
my arms to try and comfort her and started screaming for help."</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agent Jeremy Birchell, 28, saw the crash from his
nearby office.</TE>
<TE>   "The train was absolutely hoofing along and some part of it must
have been off the rails already, because it knocked away parts of the
bridge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going at a tremendous speed and when it struck there was a
really, really loud noise, and I could feel it as well. I have never
seen or heard anything like it in my life." He said he saw people
leave the crashed car.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one gentleman in his suit walking down the tracks with
a head wound--he was still carrying his briefcase," Birchell said.</TE>
<TE>   Inspector Philip Trendall of the British Transport Police said the
other cars on the train remained upright and incurred no significant
damage.</TE>
<TE>   It was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Gisbey, of Railtrack, said, "We have no evidence the train has
gone through any signals."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Supt. David Hatcher of the British Transport Police said it
was not clear if all those killed had been in the car that flipped on
its side. One of the bodies was found under the bridge that takes the
railway line over a road.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Tarling, 70, and his wife were in their car under the bridge,
but escaped serious injury.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a traffic jam. I was stuck in it. I heard the roar of a
train. Then suddenly the roof all came crashing down. The whole of
the roof caved in," he said. "We got out, but we were showered with
glass and debris."</TE>
<TE>   Helen Edmondson, of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Ambulance
Service, said that no one remained aboard the train and that everyone
was being treated.</TE>
<TE>   From his hospital bed, 29-year-old Mark Guest, one of the less
seriously hurt, described how it felt as the car he sat in derailed.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember falling and then hearing a loud bang and I felt the
train coming off the tracks and then I just started rolling," he
said. "I could hear screaming and I was looking down the train and
heard the glass shattering."</TE>
<TE>   As evening fell, dozens of police officers searched the site for
clues to the cause of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The West Anglia Great Northern train derailed about 12:56 p.m.,
about 10 minutes after leaving London for King's Lynn in Norfolk,
eastern England.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-five people have been killed in five previous British rail
accidents in the last five years.</TE>

<LD>   Like Mishra, thousands of Hindus in Varanasi, the heartland of
Hinduism, take a bath or dip every day in the belief that it will
cleanse them of their sins.</LD>
<LD>   What they are willing to overlook are the billions of gallons of
sewage that pour into the Ganges as the river flows from the
Himalayas in northern India to the Bay of Bengal in the east, a
distance of more than 1,600 miles.</LD>
<TE>   The river is considered holy because, according to Hindu
mythology, Ganges is the mother goddess of India, and water from the
river can be offered in prayers to other deities.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, perhaps 40% to 45% of the people who take a dip in
the river regularly have skin or stomach ailments, according to
doctors and state government health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been an alarming increase in skin infections and
waterborne diseases in this area," said Dr. B.P. Tiwari at the
Sanjeevan Hospital in Varanasi.</TE>
<TE>   Many who become ill deny that the Ganges is to blame, insisting
that its holiness makes it pure.</TE>
<TE>   Mishra, a hydraulic engineering expert, developed skin and stomach
ailments a few times, and now restricts himself to taking a dip in
the river, instead of bathing and sipping. The "holy dip" means the
devotee sips some of the virtually black water.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how damaging is fecal coliform and oxygenic waste," Mishra
said of the pollutants in the river.</TE>
<TE>   Varanasi, a city of 1.5 million people, pumps 80 million gallons
of sewage waste daily into the river. Most of the sewage pipes empty
at the same riverbank points that Hindu devotees use to perform their
religious rites.</TE>
<TE>   Along the riverbank, some people wash clothes. Others toss in the
ashes of dead relatives. Some Hindus dump corpses into the river,
despite a ban on such practices.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago the government began a plan to clean the river, but
environmental activists say it has failed to curb pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Water treatment plants were set up to process sewage in Varanasi,
but these plants are either faulty or lack capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Their malfunctioning has exacerbated the pollution, said Shanti
Lal Jain, a social worker who cleans the pavements along the
riverbanks.</TE>
<TE>   Mishra also believes the government plan is too limited. "Simple
water treatment cannot purify the fecal coliform in the polluted
water," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mishra's group, Friends of Ganges, and other local and national
environmentalists have worked through the High Court of the state of
Uttar Pradesh and India's Supreme Court to pressure the federal
government to approve a project called Clean Ganges. It would take
court action to stop the practices that pollute the river.</TE>
<TE>   But court orders are not always speedily obeyed in India. Appeals
and other delays can drag things out for years.</TE>
<TE>   The government also hasn't done much to clear silt brought in by
floodwaters.</TE>
<TE>   The river is normally anywhere from 16 feet to 65 feet deep and as
narrow as 275 yards or as wide as 385 yards. But the silt has reduced
the depth and width, restricting the river's ability to flush waste
out to sea.</TE>

<HD>In These Chill Waters, Icebergs Are the Catch</HD>
<DH>Safety: Ninety years after the Titanic's sinking, crews
patrol North Atlantic, seeking to prevent another disaster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>OFF NEWFOUNDLAND</DL>
<LD>The icebergs may be big, but the ocean is endless.</LD>
<LD>   The hours pass as Tristan Krein stares out the window of the
Hercules C-130, searching for ice. Sometimes he takes out his
binoculars and scans the empty horizon; other times, clouds obscure
the waves and he is a man looking at nothing.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes we're begging for things to look at," says Krein, 35.</LD>
<TE>   But other times, the members of the International Ice Patrol look
down and see peaks of glistening white floating in the frigid
currents. They record the iceberg's location, its size and its shape,
and they know that every observation they make is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   Every other week during the iceberg season--usually from February
to July--the Ice Patrol flies over the North Atlantic, keeping track
especially of the southernmost area in which icebergs have been
spotted. This is crucial; the patrol's findings tell mariners how far
south they must sail to avoid any chance of hitting an iceberg.</TE>
<TE>   These, after all, are the waters that claimed the Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Ice Patrol, operated by the U.S. Coast Guard on
behalf of 17 countries, has been looking for icebergs since 1913,
after a horrified world resolved that it would never again allow the
kind of accident that sent the Titanic to the Atlantic floor on April
15, 1912.</TE>
<TE>   In all those years, there has not been a single reported loss of
life or property from a collision with an iceberg in an area the Ice
Patrol proclaimed to be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredibly important," says the patrol's commander, Bob
Desh.</TE>
<TE>   It's also obscure. There have been books written about the
patrol--in fact, Krein recalls reading one when he was in school--but
mostly, it does its work quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Krein did not join the Ice Patrol because of that book (by the
time he had enlisted, he'd even forgotten that the patrol was part of
the Coast Guard). He, like his fellow "ice picks," joined the patrol
because it's a small unit with a unique mission.</TE>
<TE>   "It was different from everything else," says Bryan Grebe, 26.
Like the others, he is a marine science technician. Chances are, if
he weren't a member of the Ice Patrol he would be inspecting vessels
to ensure that they are safe.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they supervise as temperature and current sensors are
dropped from the plane. They stare out the windows, or they watch
over the shoulders of technicians--"tweets"--who monitor forward- and
side-looking radar.</TE>
<TE>   And at the end of a day aloft, they examine their data and send
them to patrol headquarters in Groton, Conn. There, the information
is plugged into computer models that will project the drift of the
icebergs; twice a day, the patrol issues reports that are dispatched
to the nations that share the $11,000-an-hour cost of the patrol's
flights.</TE>
<TE>   The icebergs calve from Greenland's glaciers, the result of
thousands of years of accumulated snow. After melting slowly in cold
Arctic bays, they are carried south to the Grand Banks by the
Labrador Current. Four hundred to 800 a year make it as far as the
48th parallel, which is even with St. John's, Newfoundland.
Eventually, they melt in warmer waters.</TE>
<TE>   The smallest ones are known as growlers because they make a
growling noise as they rise and fall with the swells. The section
above water--the smallest part--is less than 3 feet high and 16 feet
long.</TE>
<TE>   The largest iceberg ever seen in the North Atlantic was 550 feet
tall, nearly as tall as the Washington monument. But most are small
or medium-sized, like the one that destroyed the Titanic: 50 to 100
feet high and 200 to 400 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, the ice picks fly at 6,500 feet, and the
icebergs appear to be "a thumbnail on the horizon," Desh says. About
70% of the time, he says, they don't see the icebergs at all; they're
obscured by clouds or fog, and are observed only by radar.</TE>
<TE>   So this is the Ice Patrol's glamorous duty: six to eight hours in
a cold, noisy (earplugs required), 29-year-old tin can of an
airplane, with the likelihood of seeing nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a crew member sets up a hammock at the rear of the plane
and sacks out.</TE>
<TE>   Climb up on the flight deck and you'll find flight engineer Chris
Collins paging through a book filled with compact discs: Veruca Salt,
George Thorogood, Rush, Shania Twain. He pops one into a CD player
connected to the intercom system. "That's our flight entertainment,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot Carey Hixson and co-pilot Wes Hester often have their feet
up. The plane must fly precise routes so that its radar will map the
seas precisely, and autopilot does that.</TE>
<TE>   "Takeoff and landing--otherwise it's boring," says Hixson.</TE>
<TE>   So why do they do it?</TE>
<TE>   Partly, it's the extra pay--a $70 per diem while they're in
Newfoundland, and $150 a month in flight pay. Partly, it's because
they like coming up from Groton and Elizabeth City, N.C., where the
tweets, the flight crews and the mechanics are based.</TE>
<TE>   There are local delicacies, like moose steak and codfish tongues.
And Krein says he and others have had girlfriends in Newfoundland.
"They're very friendly up here--and I mean that in a very respectful
way," he says, hastening to add that he is true to his current
girlfriend back in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly they do it because they believe they are accomplishing
something important.</TE>
<TE>   They know what happens when ice meets metal. Every year, they mark
the anniversary of the Titanic's sinking with a ceremony outlined in
the Coast Guard's manual of standard operating procedure.</TE>
<TE>   On this year's 90th anniversary, on April 15, the C-130 dipped to
400 feet, affording the crew a remarkable view of two icebergs, one
of them about the size of the one the Titanic hit. "It is with great
respect and reverence," Hixson said, that the Coast Guard remembered
the 1,522 victims of the Titanic and paused "to remember the
importance of our mission."</TE>
<TE>   And then crew members dropped two bouquets from the open cargo
door.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts a lump in my throat," says Jim Wineteer, 32, one of the
tweets.</TE>
<TE>   Wineteer has given a lot of thought to the Titanic disaster. Those
1,522 people weren't really killed by the iceberg, he says; they were
killed by the arrogance of the engineers and the technicians who did
not believe in their own fallibility or the power of nature.</TE>
<TE>   It is a mistake, he says, that the International Ice Patrol will
not make.</TE>

<HD>China's 'Lost Army' Sees Future in Tea</HD>
<DH>Exiles: Veterans and their descendants blend into the local
Thai economy, which relies on plantations and tourism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENIS D. GRAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MAE SALONG, Thailand</DL>
<LD>As the mists swirl around this mountain settlement, it's easy to
imagine the old soldiers from China's "lost army"--their ranks
withered by wars and time--setting off on their last march.</LD>
<LD>   They might not be marching off to paradise, given their history of
drug smuggling and other nefarious deeds.</LD>
<LD>   But these embattled veterans seem to deserve some tranquillity
after surviving China's cataclysmic revolution, bloody battles and
heartache over a half-century of exile.</LD>
<TE>   "We had no money, no food, no guns and no country. We had nowhere
to go," said Gen. Lue Ye-tein, at 86 one of the last of the
Kuomintang officers who fled China's Yunnan province in 1949 as
Communist leader Mao Tse-tung consolidated his victory over Chiang
Kai-shek's nationalists.</TE>
<TE>   From the chaos of China's revolution, the remnants of the
Kuomintang found themselves unwelcome guests in Myanmar (then Burma).
In the early 1960s they were forced into northern Thailand, where
they were enlisted to help fight communist guerrillas in exchange for
asylum.</TE>
<TE>   "The past was a nightmare. Let's look to the future," the
sprightly, ramrod-straight Lue likes to say.</TE>
<TE>   For the old men of the Kuomintang's 93rd Division--dubbed the
"lost army" after it fled China--the future for them and their
descendants seems to lie in tea, tourism and gradual integration into
Thai society.</TE>
<TE>   Once a largely isolated state within a state run by its own
secretive military commanders, Mae Salong welcomes tourists, many
from Taiwan and Chinese communities elsewhere in Southeast Asia and
China.</TE>
<TE>   Red lanterns and scrolls inscribed with sayings from Chinese
classics sway from the eaves of Yunnanese-style houses. Elders
converse in Mandarin. Ruddy youngsters practice Chinese characters
from books sent by Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still a Chinese town," said Chang Zhu-ping, a friendly
young businessman offering cups of the strong local brew at one of
the many tea shops on the town's main road.</TE>
<TE>   Five sizable tea plantations and many smaller family-run plots
blanket Mae Salong's hillsides. Some of the larger enterprises are
joint ventures with Taiwanese, who provided technical expertise and
introduced the more profitable oolong variety.</TE>
<TE>   A tea theme park is being built by the wealthy son of an
ex-Kuomintang soldier. Two giant tea kettles, painted silver and
gold, are nearing completion, and four more are planned.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, tea fanciers will be able to sample teas from throughout the
world--and stay overnight inside one of the concrete kettles.</TE>
<TE>   Lue says Thai authorities encourage maintaining Mae Salong's
Chinese look and atmosphere to attract tourists' money.</TE>
<TE>   But the town faces economic and social problems. Sun Jiang, a shop
owner and brother of the town headman, estimates that 90% of its high
school graduates must leave to find work in the Thai capital of
Bangkok or in Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Chiang Kai-shek had his Kuomintang government in Taiwan, and the
Taiwanese built Mae Salong's school and sent teachers.</TE>
<TE>   But Sun says most Mae Salong youths who go to Taiwan can find only
menial work, do not marry Taiwanese women who tend to look down on
them, and often feel like strangers despite the shared culture,
language and history.</TE>
<TE>   "Truly the people of Mae Salong are smart, and they work hard, but
they don't have many opportunities," Sun said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuomintang 93rd Division trekked out of Yunnan into Myanmar
after Mao's victory in 1949. Into the early 1960s, the soldiers
staged futile forays into their homeland with aid from Taiwan and the
United States. Lue, the old general, remembers it as a time of great
hardship.</TE>
<TE>   It also was a time when the Kuomintang soldiers gained a
reputation as opium traffickers and smugglers of jade and antiques.</TE>
<TE>   Lue denies that his men were ever involved in narcotics, in
Myanmar or Thailand. "We had to fight here and there. How could we
have planted opium?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   But his predecessor as Kuomintang commander in Mae Salong, Gen.
Tuan Shi-wen, once admitted: "We have to continue to fight the evil
of communism, and to fight you must have an army, and an army must
have guns, and to buy guns you must have money. In these mountains,
the only money is opium."</TE>
<TE>   Chased out of Myanmar, the Kuomintang fighters split into two
armies when they moved to Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Tuan, whose pagoda-style mausoleum overlooks the town, set up at
Mae Salong.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Ly Wen-huan moved his men to neighboring Chiang Mai province.</TE>
<TE>   Both colonies were closed, regimented societies with residents
restricted to the area by Thai authorities, but the Chinese exiles
and their hosts came to arrangements of mutual benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuomintang helped fight Thai communists, then disbanded its
military organization in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand's government began to grant citizenship, although some
among the estimated 20,000 Kuomintang soldiers and their families are
still awaiting Thai papers.</TE>
<TE>   China receded in the collective memory even though tourists and
businessmen come from China and a few men from Mae Salong have
married women from the old homeland.</TE>
<TE>   "Here people still hate the communists. They think of themselves
as truly Thai," Lue said.</TE>
<TE>   "China is ready to receive them but they don't want to go back."</TE>

<HD>Retailers Recruited in War Against Meth</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Store employees are asked to spot
suspicious purchases of material used to make the drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMBERLY HEFLING</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>OWENSBORO, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Four boxes of cold medicine and a suspicious store clerk put
27-year-old Suzett Calloway back behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   Wanted for murder after her son died from injuries he suffered in
an explosion while, police say, she and her boyfriend were cooking up
methamphetamine in their home, Calloway fled Georgia. She eluded
police for several days until she walked up to a checkout counter at
a Wal-Mart in western Kentucky. She was carrying four boxes of
Sudafed.</LD>
<LD>   The sales clerk, on the lookout for customers buying ingredients
that could be used to make meth, urged a Wal-Mart security guard to
follow Calloway. After a stop for more Sudafed at a second retailer,
Calloway was arrested.</LD>
<TE>   She and her boyfriend are in jail awaiting trial on murder and
drug charges; both have pleaded innocent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'You Can't Hardly Do Anything'</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, police in several states are informally turning to
retailers for assistance in catching meth makers cooking the
lucrative and addictive drug in backyard sheds, motel rooms and vans.</TE>
<TE>   "Without their help, you can't hardly do anything about the meth
problem, at the rate it's increasing," said Trooper Mark Applin of
the Kentucky State Police.</TE>
<TE>   Some retailers say they participate out of a sense of duty. Others
do it to curb meth-cooking shoplifters who might buy one box of a
cold medicine, only to steal three others.</TE>
<TE>   Still others worry they will be forced to keep a buyer's log or
face other burdensome restrictions if they don't do something to
help, said Joe Lackey, president of the Indiana Grocery and
Convenience Store Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone likes the idea of police turning to shopkeepers for
help. One civil rights advocate said using retailers to report
shoppers could lead to abuse in evidence gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably not fair to the manufacturer, but what do you do?"
asked Lou Watkins of Baum's Market in Boonville, Ind., where the bulk
of the cold medicine is kept behind the counter. "They steal more of
it than they buy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meth Is Called Poor Man's Cocaine</TE>
<TE>   Some call meth the poor man's cocaine because it is a highly
addictive stimulant that produces a euphoria similar to cocaine, but
lasts longer--six to eight hours compared with 20 to 60 minutes for
cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most illegal drugs, the products used to make meth are
legal and easily available: cold pills, nail polish remover, rubbing
alcohol, salt and batteries. The recipe is on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The overhead costs are low: roughly $100 for a gram, about the
contents of a sugar packet; $400 per ounce, with payoffs of $2,000 to
$2,500 per ounce.</TE>
<TE>   "The price of gold is about $320 per ounce. It's worth more than
gold on the streets," said Det. Joe Moran of the Owensboro Police
Department. "When you're fighting those elements there, the
addictiveness of the drug and the ease that the drug is made, it's a
doper's dream."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the number of so-called meth labs seized by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration increased from 287 in 1994 to 1,837
in 2000, said Joe Long, a DEA spokesman. That does not include labs
seized by state and local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Iowa are just some of the states
where police are noticing an uptick in the numbers of labs they
seize.</TE>
<TE>   In Indiana alone, state police dismantled six meth labs in 1995
and 681 in 2001. In Kentucky, that number rose from 268 last year
compared with just six in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In street lingo, those who drive from store to store buying or
shoplifting meth ingredients are "P and B" people -- pill and lithium
battery buyers.</TE>
<TE>   To cut off the "P and B" people, police in Kentucky and Indiana
say they had to turn to retailers.</TE>
<TE>   They distributed fliers listing meth ingredients and asked store
operators to report license plate numbers of suspicious-looking
customers. In Columbus, Ind., a Wal-Mart employee in March reported
that a customer had attempted to shoplift three boxes of cold
medicine as he purchased rubber gloves and coffee filters.</TE>
<TE>   Police searching the 41-year-old man's car found a "meth lab"
inside it -- along with 1,100 cold medicine tablets, Columbus police
Sgt. Matt Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is one that would not have been solved if the Wal-Mart
employee had not caught him shoplifting and called it in," Myers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at Wal-Mart's 2,700 stores are encouraged to help
police, said Rob Phillips, a spokesman at the company's Bentonville,
Ark., headquarters. The store limits the sale of cold medicines and
some diet supplements to three boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about sales," Phillips said. "It's doing what's right."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'They're Building and Compiling Evidence'</TE>
<TE>   If retailers are reporting suspicious-looking people to
authorities, there is potential for abuse, said John Krull, executive
director of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a pharmacist who's got a grudge, it creates an
opportunity, obviously," Krull said. "I'm sure the police will tell
you they're only asking them to be informants, but they're building
and compiling evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Johnson, director of government relations for Sudafed
manufacturer Pfizer Inc., said the company supports allowing
consumers to buy a maximum of three boxes of cold medicine.</TE>
<TE>   But it does not back placing cold medicine behind a counter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really outrageous that the illegal activities of these
illicit drug manufacturers and dealers are really turning good
medicines into something quite the contrary," said Bob Fauteux, a
Pfizer spokesman. In the process, he said, they are making it
increasingly difficult for consumers with legitimate needs for the
products to purchase them.</TE>

<HD>She's Staking Her Claim to Be a Leader in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Government: Antonia Perez is a rarity. She heads an
unofficial local council in Chiapas state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILL WEISSERT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FELIPE ECATEPEC, Mexico</DL>
<LD>They start gathering at dawn. Men in sweat-stained cowboy hats and
mud-caked boots stand next to women in Indian skirts and smocks
hand-woven in subtle mixes of blue, red, green and yellow.</LD>
<LD>   Most arrive with sharp if rust-dotted machetes hooked to their
belts.</LD>
<LD>   But Antonia Perez faces the daily crowd armed only with a spiral
notebook and a navy-blue backpack crammed with folders and complaint
forms.</LD>
<TE>   Perez, 27, is a rarity--one of the first female "municipal agents"
in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state. A Tzotzil Indian, she heads
San Felipe's unofficial local council, which is sympathetic to the
Zapatista rebels and operates independently of the legal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Her job description includes the duties of justice of the peace,
marriage counselor, notary public and sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch over the community. I am vigilant in a way that those
from the outside cannot understand," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A single mother who earns no salary, she relies on donations from
neighbors to feed and clothe herself and her 9-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Her office is a former servant's bathroom inside a tumbledown
mansion that once belonged to a state governor but now serves as the
headquarters of the pro-Zapatista council in San Felipe.</TE>
<TE>   Elected in February by the council, Perez arrives for work at 6
a.m. every day.</TE>
<TE>   She holds a second round of office hours in the afternoon, setting
up shop in a sagging gazebo in a trash-strewn park across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Many in this community of 500 families on the outskirts of the
mountain city of San Cristobal de las Casas ask her to help with
marriage problems or to sort out property disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Her office also can act as a civil or criminal court, empowering
Perez and an Indian judge to order fines or community service for
minor crimes. Like a small-town mayor, she approves public works
projects and coordinates with state officials to improve the
village's often unreliable water, sewer and electricity services.</TE>
<TE>   Chiapas' state government has long recognized traditional Indian
governments alongside town authorities elected in conventional ways.</TE>
<TE>   After Zapatista guerrillas revolted at the beginning of 1994, the
situation became more complicated: Rebel backers formed their own
"autonomous municipalities" that sometimes operate in the same
villages as town authorities and Indian councils.</TE>
<TE>   Women have rarely been entrusted with leadership in any of those
systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Customs tell Indian communities that women cannot be trusted in
positions of authority and can never represent an entire community,"
said Amado Avendano, who was the unsuccessful Zapatista-backed
candidate in 1994 gubernatorial elections, and who then declared
himself governor in rebellion. "There was a tradition of
discrimination that went back centuries."</TE>
<TE>   Avendano said that tradition began to change with the rise of the
Zapatista movement, which proclaimed that women and men are equal.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, with their discourses and their declarations, the
Zapatistas made it legitimate for a woman to hold a position of
power," he said. "But even with rebel support, it still took
Zapatista-friendly places like San Felipe eight years to choose a
woman as its municipal agent. It will take other communities much
longer."</TE>
<TE>   Chiapas is perhaps Mexico's poorest state. Its residents are the
most undernourished and have limited access to electricity, phone
service and drinking water. Its school system is the nation's worst,
and an estimated 43% of the state's Indians are illiterate.</TE>
<TE>   "In Indian communities in Chiapas, women work in the fields and
then go home and take care of the children," said Lupita Cardanas, a
director of a women's group based in San Cristobal. "They are
important to each family, but not to all of society."</TE>
<TE>   Cecilio Perez, a member of San Felipe's pro-rebel council who is
not related to Antonia Perez, said her gender was never an issue in
her selection as municipal agent.</TE>
<TE>   "Women have always participated in politics for us, but they have
never held such an important position," the 30-year-old corn farmer
said. "Ms. Perez represents the needs of our entire community, not
just the needs of women."</TE>
<TE>   But some locals say they won't take their problems to a woman.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very tough job and I do not think she can do it," said
Carlos Sanchez, a truck driver who lives with his wife and three sons
in a three-room shack. "This position was not made for women."</TE>
<TE>   That view was apparent in February when a pro-government town
council in San Sebastian Bachajon, just outside the city of Chilon in
northern Chiapas, elected Antonia Espinosa as municipal agent.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people staged street protests against her and then
held a new meeting to elect a man, Gaspar Aguilar. His supporters
threatened to kidnap Chilon Mayor Andres Hernandez unless he changed
the locks on San Sebastian's municipal building to keep Espinosa out.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa, a 34-year-old Chol Indian, said she will keep fighting
to get her job back.</TE>
<TE>   "This community wanted a change," she said. "It wanted to prove
that women are capable of doing everything men are. I will one day
give my people that change."</TE>

<HD>A Mother's Angel Gives Life to Many</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: After her 3-year-old daughter is declared
brain-dead, a woman agrees to donate the girl's organs. She is among
the recipients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Most of her life, Michele Garibay felt doomed in love and cursed by
bad health.</LD>
<LD>   Her sisters were pretty and petite. She was chunky and tall.</LD>
<LD>   Her sisters had boyfriends and jobs. She was sick, always
struggling with another collapse, another out-of-control fever,
another round of delirious nights with intravenous drips and
catheters and antiseptic hospital smells.</LD>
<TE>   There were times when she didn't care whether she lived or died.</TE>
<TE>   And then along came an angel, a child who taught her love and
strength and laughter, who wrapped her in happiness, who assured her
with every hug and every smile and every cry of "Mommy! Mommy!" that
she was the most special person in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Michele knew it was a miracle--and she knew it was too precious to
last.</TE>
<TE>   And so, when the doctor broke the news, she accepted his words
with a strength that seemed unimaginable.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't cry when her 3-year-old daughter was declared
brain-dead.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't hesitate when asked about donating her daughter's
organs. For years, Michele had been on a waiting list for a kidney
transplant; she understood her child could save other lives.</TE>
<TE>   But what the doctor suggested next seemed so unbearable, so
unreal, she almost fainted in horror.</TE>
<TE>   Your child's kidneys could save your life.</TE>
<TE>   "No!" Michele gasped, burying her face in her hands. "I'd rather
die and be with her."</TE>
<TE>   Elise Garibay Badillo came into the world against all the
odds--born to a mother who wasn't supposed to have a baby, who wasn't
even supposed to live.</TE>
<TE>   At 17, Michele had been diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune
disease that would eventually destroy her kidneys. She would need
dialysis four times a day. She would get progressively worse. There
was no cure.</TE>
<TE>   But the worst blow of all was when doctors warned her against
having the baby she had always dreamed of. To get pregnant, they
said, would be to risk her own life and that of the child.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Michele nor her doctors counted on her falling in love, on
a whirlwind romance between two college students working in the
Wrigley Gum factory for the summer.</TE>
<TE>   When they broke up on Valentine's Day in 1998, Michele was six
months pregnant. She was 23 and terrified.</TE>
<TE>   There was never any question that she would try to have the baby.
The question was whether they would both survive.</TE>
<TE>   Bedridden for much of her pregnancy, Michele read everything she
could about motherhood. She played Vivaldi for the baby kicking in
her womb. She read aloud stories from Dr. Seuss.</TE>
<TE>   She might not be a mother for long, she told her own mother. But
she would be the best mother she could possibly be.</TE>
<TE>   On May 13, Michele gave birth to a healthy, 6-pound, 7-ounce girl.
She called the baby Elise, a name she thought graceful and rare.</TE>
<TE>   Elise inherited her mother's dark hair and mischievous smile. But
she possessed something more: a sunny self-confidence, a kind of
innate wisdom about her place in the world that made her seem older
than her years. The first grandchild, the first niece, she was
worshipped by a brood of Mexican relatives--every smile, every antic,
every milestone captured in photographs.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she was 2, she could mimic the lines of her favorite
movies in English and Spanish. At 3, she was sifting through photos
of Michele's male college friends, searching for a suitable "Daddy"
to live with them.</TE>
<TE>   Michele would shake her head and laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "It's you and me against the world," she would say. "And that is
the way it will always be."</TE>
<TE>   Mother and daughter were a familiar sight in their South Chicago
neighborhood, bouncing down the streets in Michele's rusty old
Mustang--belting out Britney Spears songs, trailing princess dresses,
slurping blue Slurpees, acting for all the world like summer-crazed
teens.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone could see it couldn't last. As Elise grew lanky and
strong, her mother grew sickly and weak.</TE>
<TE>   Michele couldn't lift her daughter or pick up her toys. She
couldn't take Elise to the child's favorite place--the beach--because
of the dangers of infecting the incision in her stomach for the
dialysis catheter, or the one in her chest for the intravenous drip.</TE>
<TE>   Often they stayed at Elise's grandparents' house because Michele
was too sick to walk. Michele's mother would creep into the bedroom
and weep at the sight of her daughter and granddaughter curled in
each other's arms.</TE>
<TE>   And she would wonder: what will happen to Elise when Michele is
gone?</TE>
<TE>   The little girl never stood a chance. An October storm, a gust of
wind, an enormous branch cracking and falling at precisely the moment
Elise was skipping beneath it. Though doctors performed emergency
surgery, they knew there was little hope.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family flocked to University of Chicago Children's
Hospital, where Elise lay in a white gown dotted with teddy bears,
tubes inserted into her nose and arms and head, a respirator over her
mouth. They played Vivaldi and Britney Spears. They prayed aloud in
English and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Michele refused to cry in her daughter's presence. Instead, she
would lean over the bed and whisper, over and over: Mommy will be
here when you wake up.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency room pediatrician Dr. Chris Clardy had rarely seen such
strength. And he had rarely been so moved.</TE>
<TE>   Clardy, a kidney specialist as well as a pediatrician, noticed
Michele's limp, her yellowish skin, her gaunt face. He spotted the
dialysis catheter dangling beneath her shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Without telling Michele, he called her doctors. He learned that
Michele had been waiting for a kidney transplant for years, that
cousins and sisters and parents had been tested, but no family member
was a match.</TE>
<TE>   But mother and child were.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after declaring Elise brain-dead, Clardy sat down with
Michele. There was no time to be gentle. There was no time to
console. The clock was ticking and she had to make a decision fast.</TE>
<TE>   You have perhaps a year to live, Clardy told her. Your daughter is
your only chance.</TE>
<TE>   A kidney can last 48 to 72 hours once the brain is dead, but the
longer the delay, the less likely it is the transplant will succeed.
And with a child's kidneys, the deterioration is even more rapid.</TE>
<TE>   For years Michele had known she might one day face a decision
about transplant surgery. Her biggest fear had been what would happen
to Elise if she didn't survive. Now she was being forced to make the
cruelest decision of her life.</TE>
<TE>   How could she live with her child's organs growing inside her?</TE>
<TE>   How could she not?</TE>
<TE>   And another question: How could she go through surgery knowing her
daughter was being buried at the same time? What kind of a mother
missed her daughter's funeral?</TE>
<TE>   Michele insisted that Elise's father, David Badillo, help with her
decision. Although they were no longer a couple, Badillo, a law
student, had been part of Elise's life. He had custody every other
weekend; the accident happened on one of Elise's visits. At the
hospital, he never left her bedside.</TE>
<TE>   Badillo told Michele he would support whatever decision she made.</TE>
<TE>   Michele's mother told her the choice was clear.</TE>
<TE>   Elise was an angel, Irene Garibay said. She was an angel sent by
God on a mission. And that mission was to save Michele's life. How
else could they explain the child's death? How else could they accept
it?</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since the accident, Michele sobbed
uncontrollably. Even at her daughter's bedside, she couldn't stop the
tears.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not supposed to die and leave me alone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fiercely, she caught herself. She dried her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Go," she whispered. "Don't stay for me. I will be OK. I will be
strong for you. Go, Elise, Go!"</TE>
<TE>   She didn't want Elise's spirit to linger. A mother had to set her
daughter free.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Michele was whisked off in an ambulance for surgery
in a hospital across town.</TE>
<TE>   At Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Dr. Deepak Mital
looked at the tiny kidneys on ice, a third the size of an adult's. He
looked at the mother lying on the operating table.</TE>
<TE>   "This has to work," he thought. "There has to be some meaning to
this tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Mital performs about 75 kidney transplants a year. But this was
the most complicated he had ever faced. It is rare to transplant two
kidneys to one person, rarer still to transplant a toddler's organs
into an adult. The biggest danger, aside from rejection, is that the
small kidneys will become twisted or displaced inside a body that is
too big to contain them--and will die.</TE>
<TE>   For five hours, Mital painstakingly stitched the daughter's organs
into the mother's, vein to vein, artery to artery. And when it was
done, when emotion could once again nudge aside professional
precision, Mital thought of his own children. And of the little girl
who had given her mother life.</TE>
<TE>   These kidneys have to work, he repeated.</TE>
<TE>   They buried Elise in her princess dress with a tiara on her head
and a teddy bear in her arms. Her eulogy was a letter from her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you Elise, Michele wrote. Thank you for the most wonderful
31/2 years. Thank you for teaching me to be strong. Thank you for
giving me life.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was buried with the child.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours after Elise's coffin was lowered into the ground,
Michele noticed a tingling in her hands, a pinkness when she pressed
her palms. She gazed at them in wonder. They hadn't been pink in
years.</TE>
<TE>   And then she realized. Her blood wasn't contaminated anymore. Her
daughter's kidneys were already working. Over and over she squeezed
her hands.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Elise, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The mother dreams about her daughter all the time, but Elise's
spirit has visited just once.</TE>
<TE>   Michele was lying in bed, too sad to move, too tired to stop the
tears. And then she felt it, one of those loopy hugs they used to
give each other every morning, so tight, so long, they joked they
might choke the breath out of each other.</TE>
<TE>   "She came," Michele says. "She didn't let me see her, not even in
a dream, because she knew it would be too painful. But she let me
sense her and smell her and she let me know that she is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Six months after surgery, Michele is healthier than she has been
in years. She can hobble without her cane; the nerve damage to her
feet caused by kidney failure is gradually healing.</TE>
<TE>   The kidneys growing inside her--they are now almost full size--are
only organs, she says. She doesn't think of them as a part of her
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   She points out that Elise gave life to others too: Her liver went
to a 15-year-old, her small intestine to an infant.</TE>
<TE>   "The part of my daughter that is with me is the memory of her 31/2
years," Michele says. "That is the part that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Lupus is a mysterious illness and doctors don't know how it may
eventually affect her new kidneys. Michele must take anti-rejection
medication daily. She still tires and catches infections easily. She
still has days when grief numbs her soul.</TE>
<TE>   But she is living again, a new life, one that is rich in a new
way.</TE>
<TE>   She keeps a journal to remember little things, like the sound of
Elise's laugh. Someday she hopes to share it with her next child.</TE>
<TE>   She plans to return to Columbia College in Chicago and finish her
degree in communications.</TE>
<TE>   She is singing and playing guitar again with her all-girl
Spanish-language rock band for the first time in years.</TE>
<TE>   They have a few gigs set up. And they have a new song.</TE>
<TE>   It's a song about an angel, a child sent into the world on a
mission. Written by Michele, it is a mother's tribute, and a mother's
lament.</TE>
<TE>   In Spanish, Michele sings it, eyes shining, voice husky and tender
and strong.</TE>
<TE>   Algun dia estaremos juntos</TE>
<TE>   mi angel, mi alma.</TE>
<TE>   Someday we'll be together.</TE>
<TE>   My angel, my soul.</TE>

<HD>Moldovans Have Hunger for Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE JAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHISINAU, Moldova</DL>
<LD>Mealtimes at the Zoti home are governed by a simple rule: If there's
money, there's food. Most often, there's little of either.</LD>
<LD>   "When there's something to eat, I call our son to the table, and
when there isn't, I don't," says Tatjana Zoti, her face dominated by
spirited blue eyes and cheekbones chiseled by hunger. "Rare are the
times when we feel we have eaten enough."</LD>
<LD>   The Zotis don't complain. Misery loves company in Moldova,
Europe's poorest country. With average incomes less than the
equivalent of $30 a month, most people share the same lot: cold
apartments, empty refrigerators, hand-me-down clothing and a hope
that things just have to get better.</LD>
<TE>   But worse may be ahead. There is unrest over the Communist
government's attempt to wrest the former Soviet republic back toward
Moscow after more than a decade in which previous administrations
courted Romania, Moldova's western neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   More than 65% of Moldovans speak a Romanian dialect; the rest
speak Russian or Ukrainian.</TE>
<TE>   Frictions over language and education ostensibly led to 80,000
protesters' confronting machine-gun-toting police in Chisinau, the
capital, in late March. But the real dispute is whether the country
should be looking east or west.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here because I do not want to go back into the Soviet
slammer," said one demonstrator, Ion Rosca, suggesting that his
country's eastward turn is shutting the door to hopes for
Western-style prosperity and democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova has long been torn
between east and west.</TE>
<TE>   Annexed from Russia by Romania during World War I, it then became
part of the Soviet Union, reverted to Romania during World War II,
then was reclaimed by Moscow. It gained independence when the Soviet
Union broke up at the end of 1991.</TE>
<TE>   High hopes that accompanied the communist collapse were soon lost
to deepening gloom as a series of governments became mired in
corruption and infighting.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Romanian Slavs revolted in 1992, carving out the
self-proclaimed republic of Trans Dniester, a strip of territory
along the Ukrainian border that bleeds Moldova's economy through arms
smuggling and untaxed trade worth billions of dollars a year.</TE>
<TE>   Crime is rampant. Austrian police confiscated the Moldovan
interior minister's car a few years ago in Vienna after a computer
check revealed it had been stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Misery leads to gruesome acts: Two women were arrested last year
for selling human remains from a state cancer ward as food.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling recent unrest is the disappearance of anti-communist
leader Vlad Cubreacov in late March. Anti-communists blame the
government. The communists say the kidnapping was an attempt to build
resentment against them and feed the demonstrations that started
early this year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the government say a human exodus helped the
Moscow-leaning communists win election last year because Moldovans,
frustrated at the growing misery, voted with their feet years ago.
Some 500,000 citizens--more than 10% of the population--are estimated
to have left.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the depth of frustration, even government members are
blunt about the misery. "Nobody is seriously interested in our
country," says Deputy Economics Minister Marian Lupu.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few thousand believe that they have a stake in the
nation--many of them former communist insiders who profited from
Moldova's disintegration by snapping up the bargains in halfhearted
campaigns to sell state industry.</TE>
<TE>   They are found at restaurants like the Barracuda, where a quartet
plays cool jazz and guests wash down cockscomb salad, tripe soup and
other local delicacies with satiny Moldovan wine. A bargain by
Western standards, the bill for three on a recent visit came to a
month's average pay.</TE>
<TE>   In another part of the city, among decaying Soviet-era concrete
high-rises, the Zotis count their blessings.</TE>
<TE>   Andrei, 44, an electrical engineer, earns just over $10 a month at
state radio and television. In a good month, he makes a little more
repairing TVs and radios. Rent and utilities alone consume more than
a third of monthly income.</TE>
<TE>   Tatjana, 39, an unemployed biologist, is taking accounting
classes. Patting her husband's knee, she makes light of their plight,
as she shares with visitors the contents of their refrigerator: two
tiny sausages and half a bottle of vodka.</TE>
<TE>   "When he has food, he feels lazy," she says, smiling at Andrei,
whose lumpy sweater hangs much too loosely on his frame.</TE>
<TE>   Grinning at his guests, Andrei raises a glass for a toast: "May we
live long and flourish!"</TE>

<HD>Identity of 'Deep Throat' Is an Enduring Mystery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Nixon is dead, Katharine Graham is dead, even Linda Lovelace
is dead.</LD>
<LD>   But Deep Throat? Still alive, and still a secret more than a
quarter-century after his guidance helped Washington Post reporters
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein break the Watergate story and unseat
a president.</LD>
<LD>   John Dean says he knows Deep Throat's identity. And the former
White House counsel, whose testimony against Nixon was a key moment
in the saga, says he will reveal all in "The Deep Throat Brief." The
electronic book will be published June 17, the 30th anniversary of
the Watergate break-in.</LD>
<TE>   "He's pretty certain he knows who it is," said Scott Rosenberg,
managing editor of the online magazine Salon, which will offer Dean's
book.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Dean was pretty certain in 1975, when he said Deep
Throat was Earl J. Silbert, a Watergate prosecutor. And he was pretty
certain in 1982, when he named Alexander Haig, who was eventually
Nixon's chief of staff and Ronald Reagan's secretary of State.</TE>
<TE>   Silbert and Haig denied it. This is to be expected. Everyone
denies being Deep Throat. Including, Woodward says, Deep Throat.</TE>
<TE>   The shadowy source "was risking a great deal personally and
professionally," he said in 1997. "You may assume that in the course
of this he was not truthful with colleagues and family members and he
denied that he had provided information."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nixon Believed Motive Was to Join the Media</TE>
<TE>   Washington cannot abide a secret, especially one Dean has called
"the best-kept secret in the history of the capital." So while the
particulars of Deep Throat's exploits have faded in memory for many
Americans, for others--politicians, historians and
journalists--speculation about his identity remains a favorite parlor
game.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon was not immune. Monica Crowley, a young aide to the former
president for four years before his death in 1994, quoted Nixon as
saying Deep Throat was "someone on the inside.... One person who
thought he had a lot to gain by spilling his guts to those two guys,"
someone who wanted to be seen as a liberal because he wanted "a media
career."</TE>
<TE>   Dean "was a traitor," Nixon said, but Deep Throat "went even
beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the public only came to know Deep Throat through "All the
President's Men," the 1974 book by Woodward and Bernstein, and
through the 1976 film based on the book in which the source was
played by Hal Holbrook.</TE>
<TE>   "Woodward had a source in the executive branch who had access to
information at [the Committee to Re-Elect the President] as well as
at the White House. His identity was unknown to anyone else," the
book says.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward promised he would never identify the source or quote him,
even anonymously. The source would confirm information secured
elsewhere, and might "add some perspective."</TE>
<TE>   When he talked with his editors, Woodward called the source "my
friend," until Managing Editor Howard Simons dubbed him Deep Throat
after the porn film in which Lovelace starred.</TE>
<TE>   Deep Throat knew everything, from the involvement of top
administration officials in the break-in at Democratic offices at the
Watergate complex, to the erasures on tapes Nixon turned over to
prosecutors under court order.</TE>
<TE>   What else does "All the President's Men" say of Deep Throat?</TE>
<TE>   He smoked cigarettes. He did a mean impression of Nixon spokesman
Ron Ziegler. And he had a penchant for cloak and dagger.</TE>
<TE>   When Woodward wanted to meet, he moved a flower pot with a red
flag to the rear of his apartment balcony. When Deep Throat wanted to
meet, he got hold of the newspaper delivered to Woodward's home,
circled the number on Page 20 and drew clock hands in the circle.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, they met at 2 a.m. in an underground parking garage.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Baruch Korff, a die-hard Nixon supporter, said he believed
that Nixon aide (and later, broadcast journalist) Diane Sawyer was
Deep Throat. Sawyer laughed, and Woodward insisted the masculine
pronouns he used for Deep Throat were no subterfuge--the source was a
man.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward also has insisted Deep Throat was an individual and not a
composite, as contended by Ziegler, Nixon speech writer Raymond Price
and David Obst, the book agent who helped Woodward and Bernstein sell
"All the President's Men."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Source Survives, Scratch Casey Off the List</TE>
<TE>   And we can assume Deep Throat is still alive. Woodward has said he
will reveal Deep Throat's identity only after the source is dead,
because if he did it sooner, sources he deals with today might
question whether he can keep a confidence.</TE>
<TE>   So we can strike former CIA chief William Casey from the list of
prospects. He died in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   But there are plenty of other possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative activist Howard Phillips and former Justice
Department official Robert Mardian proposed White House lawyer
Leonard Garment. "It's not me. Honest," said Garment, and he in turn
has promoted White House aide John Sears.</TE>
<TE>   "I categorically deny this," Sears said in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Others besides Dean have named Haig. "Totally untrue," Haig said.
"My efforts then and now have been to preserve the presidency, not to
tear it down." He thought Deep Throat was with the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   CBS newsman Mike Wallace reported that Deep Throat was most likely
L. Patrick Gray, the acting FBI director who lived four blocks from
Woodward.</TE>
<TE>   Gray, of course, denied it.</TE>
<TE>   FBI official W. Mark Felt, Assistant Atty. Gen. Henry Peterson,
deputy White House Counsel Fred Fielding--all have been short-listed
as possible Deep Throats.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Post publisher Graham went to her grave without knowing
the name of the key source in the biggest story her newspaper ever
broke. Editor Benjamin Bradlee assured her the source was good, and
that was enough.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bradlee didn't know Deep Throat's identity until one spring
day, years after Watergate, when he sat with Woodward on a park bench
at lunch. When Bradlee asked, Woodward shared one of the greatest
secrets of the century.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never told a soul," Bradlee said.</TE>

<HD>Seeking a Ripple in Time and Space</HD>

<AU>LINDA ASHTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>RICHLAND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>This summer, two observatories in the United States begin their
search for gravitational waves from outer space, looking for evidence
of black holes, neutron stars and supernovas.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe even remnants of the big bang, the great cosmic explosion
that might have birthed the universe 15 billion years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a new window on the universe," said Beverly Berger, program
director for gravitational physics at the National Science Foundation
in Arlington, Va.</LD>
<TE>   "In the past, whenever astronomers have opened a new window,
they've seen something unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   Cosmic cataclysms are believed to produce ripples--gravitational
waves--that travel at the speed of light in the fabric of space and
time, but so far, no one's ever seen them.</TE>
<TE>   The effect researchers are looking for is similar to that of a
rock being dropped into water, with the ripples diminishing in size
the farther they get from the spot where the rock fell.</TE>
<TE>   It's essentially an emerging area of physics and astronomy, but it
builds on a nearly century-old idea: Albert Einstein predicted the
existence of gravitational waves with his general theory of
relativity in 1916.</TE>
<TE>   Almost a century later, scientists believe the precision
technology finally exists to find them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for very violent events where space gets
disrupted," said physicist Fred Raab, director of the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) at Hanford
nuclear reservation in south-central Washington.</TE>
<TE>   LIGO Hanford works in tandem with LIGO Livingston, 1,877 miles
away, at a site just east of Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   Raab compares LIGO to a big microphone "listening" for
gravitational waves with equipment that can convert those waves to
audible signals.</TE>
<TE>   While researchers are reasonably certain that the waves exist,
they don't know if this LIGO detector will be able to see them, Raab
said. Sometime this summer, they'll turn on the lasers and wait.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists believe that the initial system might detect waves,
Raab said, and a more advanced system, which could be up and running
by 2008, should detect them.</TE>
<TE>   The cosmic explosions--collisions of black holes or the blasts of
a supernova--happen hundreds of millions of light years away, so the
gravitational waves would be extremely faint.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't happen nearby typically, which is a good thing,
because it would destroy us," Raab said.</TE>
<TE>   Black holes are collapsed stars so dense that not even light can
escape their gravity.</TE>
<TE>   Much larger supermassive black holes are believed to occupy the
centers of galaxies, where they swallow hundreds of thousands of
stars.</TE>
<TE>   "LIGO gives us information that we don't have access to any other
way, things like black holes, things we can only infer from the light
we see," Berger said.</TE>
<TE>   Here in the sagebrush desert, the interferometer is made up of a
pair of 2.5-mile-long vacuum tubes that jut at right angles from a
central building where a laser bounces light off specially designed
mirrors that will help catch and reflect the minute vibrations of
gravitational waves.</TE>
<TE>   The waves are so small they are expected to move the mirrors by
one-thousandth of a fermi, a measurement that's less than a
trillionth of the diameter of a human hair.</TE>
<TE>   With the LIGO project, researchers will be able to search a volume
of space "many billions of times larger than has been searched in all
of history," Raab said.</TE>
<TE>   The two observatories were built to work together, a means of
confirming gravitational waves amid the other vibrational noise of
the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   It is less likely that two sites separated by almost 2,000 miles
would detect false signals at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Other interferometers are being constructed in Europe and one is
operating in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-year-old LIGO project has cost $372 million so far and is
funded by the National Science Foundation. It is operated by Caltech
and MIT.</TE>

<HD>Nuns' Tapestry of Devotion</HD>
<DH>Fashion: Versace and other design houses are interested in
purchasing Byzantine textiles that are woven for priestly vestments.
But some sisters are skittish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISON MUTLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TIGANESTI, Romania</DL>
<LD>From the sanctity of a 19th-century convent, Romanian nuns weave
vivid, Byzantine cloth for Orthodox priests. Word of the sumptuous
silk has reached fashion designers--and soon could debut on the
catwalk.</LD>
<LD>   The Romanian Orthodox Church disclosed recently that the Versace
fashion house is negotiating to buy the cloth, a rich fabric
encrusted with metallic embroidery and usually made into priests'
robes costing about $120.</LD>
<LD>   "Fashion houses have shown an interest in the Byzantine cloth,
including Versace," said the Rev. Radu Boraciu, a technical director
for the nuns' fabric workshop.</LD>
<TE>   But not all of the nuns are thrilled that their handiwork might be
worn off the altar.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to dress mannequins. We want the cloth to be used
in church," said Mother Mira, who runs the workshop but is not
involved in the negotiations, which she said are being discussed "at
a high level in the church."</TE>
<TE>   Telephone messages left with Versace headquarters in Milan, Italy,
were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Italian-Romanian Chamber of Commerce said
many Italian fashion houses have operations in Romania but are
secretive about their activities.</TE>
<TE>   Tiganesti Convent, 25 miles north of the Romanian capital of
Bucharest, began making the cloth in 1924 as employment for the nuns.</TE>
<TE>   Peles Castle, which belonged to former King Michael, was furnished
with the fabric.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters have sold it before, though never to a fashion house.
Bolts of the shimmering cloth have been bought by churches from the
United States, France and Germany, and by the wives of diplomats
visiting the abbey.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy the cloth will be used by a fashion designer," said
Sister Justinian. "Don't they make material like this abroad?"</TE>
<TE>   A yard of Byzantine cloth--in tones of amber, aquamarine, mint
green, scarlet or cream--costs from $4.50 to $14. Imported German or
Italian material of similar quality would cost about $120 a yard in a
Bucharest fashion shop.</TE>
<TE>   It takes 90 minutes for a yard to be woven on the convent's
clanking mechanical looms, and up to a week to fit the machines with
the cloth pattern. Some fabric is imported from Italy, and the
glittery thread from Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Nuns work day or evening shifts in a room reeking of the oil that
keeps the looms running smoothly. Their salaries are paid by the
church.</TE>
<TE>   Paper icons have been pinned to the machines to remind the nuns
that they are working for God, not haute couture.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the nuns broke away from the secular world, and to talk
about 'fashion houses' seems odd to them," Boraciu said from his
Bucharest office.</TE>
<TE>   "But I said: 'Girls, there's nothing bad in that. Your work will
not just be seen in the church, but everywhere.'"</TE>
<TE>   Sister Eupraxie, sewing a tapestry of Jesus Christ with luminous
thread and fake rubies and diamonds, takes a pragmatic view.</TE>
<TE>   "We do our duty, and the material is good quality. We are not
responsible for what happens to it afterward," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "However, I know some of the wives of ambassadors who come here to
make jackets, because I see them trying the swatches of material.
I've just never seen the final product," she added with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Romanian fashion designer Catalin Botezatu, a protege of the late
Gianni Versace, agrees that Byzantine cloth could make beautiful
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I will include the material in a collection later this year,"
Botezatu said. "I am one of the first designers to do this.</TE>
<TE>   "The Romanians haven't always appreciated the material, but they
will."</TE>

<DH>THE STRENGTH OF THE SUN: A Novel, By Catherine Chidgey,
Henry Holt: 286 pp. $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D.J. CARLILE</AU>
<BD>D.J. Carlile is the translator of "Rimbaud: The Works."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day of a solar eclipse in New Zealand in 1988, teenager Laura
Pearse leaves home to watch the event, then meet a friend for tennis.
She never meets the friend; she never returns home. Her own eclipse
is total. But her presence permeates this novel--as a ghost, a
photograph, a memory, a symbol.</LD>
<LD>   Ten years later, medievalist Patrick Mercer drives his car off a
bridge in a suburb of London and ends up comatose in a hospital bed.
He dreams of lecturing to a gaggle of animals on the uses of
parchment. A little later, Colette, a college girl in New Zealand,
begins to receive notes from "The Friends of Patrick Mercer" asking
for letters that can be read to the comatose patient. She has no idea
who this man might be.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Ruth and Malcolm Pearse try to put their lives back
together after the disappearance of their daughter. They have a
second child. They move into a new home.</LD>
<TE>   This is how Catherine Chidgey's second novel, "The Strength of the
Sun," proceeds apace: Pieces of the story unspool, we backtrack and
move forward in increments. All of these characters are connected,
but the pattern is obscure until the final chapters. Some of these
puzzles are explained in the course of the telling; some are left for
the reader to sort out through inference and deduction. Like Sherlock
Holmes, we need to sift the available evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Chidgey writes: "Stories survive. Details survive. The colour of a
jacket, threads of a conversation or song, the aroma of a meal--such
details can survive years. But Colette had no recollection of
Patrick, despite searching her memories of overseas again and
again.... How could he have left no impression? How could there be no
trace?" The phrase "Every contact leaves a trace" recurs throughout
the novel, in exactly those words, in different places, different
contexts. It sometimes refers to Patrick's medieval books, which have
been handled for centuries, or to lives that have been brushed past
in transit or in line in a supermarket--all are somehow changed.</TE>
<TE>   The melancholy that pervades this well-crafted tale is lightened
with humor. As a child, Patrick had burned down the family home with
a magnifying glass. Colette recalls her lopsided affair with her
boyfriend while they backpacked through Europe. Ruth Pearse decides
that she needs a vacation on the spur of the moment, disappearing one
day, leaving a curt but reassuring note for nanny Colette and husband
Malcolm.</TE>
<TE>   Coming out of his coma, "Patrick thought of all the parchment
manuscripts in the museum, all the books made of skin rather than
paper: the bibles and breviaries and books of hours and herbals, the
romances and bestiaries, the psalters, the passionales. He wondered
what would happen if every one was unclasped and left to revert to
its animal form. He imagined painted goats springing from the
shelves; rustling, reconstituted sheep wandering the manuscripts
room; deer and calves and squirrels and hares filling the museum
corridors."</TE>
<TE>   The characters in this book spring from the pages; they yearn,
puzzle, remember. They search for connections to make sense of their
losses, their lives, past and present. None of it is neatly tied up
or nailed down by the final pages, but we are left with a sense of
continuation, of growth, a sense of life as a collection of preludes
and sequels, of mysteries and discoveries.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of her puzzlings, Colette is alone in the Pearses'
former home, where she rents a room: "Colette shut the curtains and
pulled the covers up under her chin. This is an old house, she told
herself. They are old windows. Glass was a liquid, she recalled, and
if left for long enough it sank and thickened, and played tricks on
the eye ...." Likewise this eloquent, elliptical novel.</TE>

<HD>The Goodbye Girl</HD>
<DH>UNLESS, A Novel, By Carol Shields, Fourth
Estate/HarperCollins: 216 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE CIABATTARI</AU>
<BD>Jane Ciabattari is the author of the short-story
collection "Stealing the Fire" and a contributing editor to Parade
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Unless," Carol Shields' 10th novel, is a thing of beauty--lucidly
written, artfully ordered, riddled with riddles and undergirded with
dark layers of philosophical meditations upon the relative value of
art, the realistic possibilities for women "who want only to be fully
human" and the nature of goodness, that enduring human dilemma also
worked thoroughly by Saul Bellow. What is goodness? How can goodness
survive in the face of evil? How should a good woman--or man--live?</LD>
<LD>   Shields, who was brought up in Oak Park, Ill.--Hemingway's
birthplace--has spent her adult life in Canada, where she raised five
children and taught literature before beginning her literary career
with the novel "Small Ceremonies," published when she was 40.</LD>
<LD>   This makes her that rare creature, a writer eligible for American
as well as British and Canadian literary prizes. She has won many,
including a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Critics Circle Award
for "The Stone Diaries," (1994), the lyrical and profound "biography"
of Daisy Stone Goodwill, an Everywoman whose life spans the
tumultuous 20th century, and Britain's Orange Prize for "Larry's
Party," her 1997 novel about an "ordinary" man with two ex-wives, a
teenage son and a growing sense of his own vulnerabilities ("Larry
Weller stars in his own life movie, but in no one else's. This is
hurtful to admit, but true").</LD>
<TE>   Shields knows her way around postmodern conceits. "Unless" is a
novel about a woman who is writing a novel about a woman who writes.
Shields plays with fact and fiction, weaving in events such as the
contested U.S. election of 2000, then gently putting them in their
place ("People enter and exit the world; that's the real news"). Her
emphasis is on emotional depth as well as dazzling wordplay.</TE>
<TE>   "Novels help us turn down the volume of our own interior
'discourse,' but unless they can provide an alternative, hopeful
course, they're just so much narrative crumble," muses Reta Winters,
the novel's narrator. "Unless, unless ... unless you're lucky, unless
you're healthy, fertile, unless you're loved and fed, unless you're
clear about your sexual direction, unless you're offered what others
are offered, you go down in the darkness, down to despair."</TE>
<TE>   Winters, nee Summer, has great self-awareness and panache. The
Orangetown, Ontario, resident is a translator of Danielle Westerman,
an octogenarian French-born poet. She is also an editor, scholar and
novelist (author of "My Thyme Is Up," a light romantic comedy), a
doctor's wife and the mother of three teenage daughters, the eldest
of whom has dropped out of college to sit cross-legged on a Toronto
street corner with a begging bowl in her lap and a cardboard sign on
her chest printed with the word "GOODNESS."</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter's actions baffle Winters, plunging her into a period
of great unhappiness and loss. She struggles to understand what has
happened and why Norah has cut her loved ones out of her life. "Norah
seems ... stung by the tang of misery, nineteen years old, with
something violent and needful beating in her brain," Winters muses.
"It's like a soft tumor, but exceptionally aggressive. Its tentacles
have entered all the quadrants of her consciousness. This invasion
happened fast, when no one was looking."</TE>
<TE>   Winters' other daughters are suffering, too--Natalie is having
trouble sleeping, Chris is falling behind in math. They spend
Saturdays sitting on the corner with their sister, but as months
pass, they give it up and get on with soccer and other activities.
Winters and Tom, her husband, consult a psychiatrist who counsels
"non-interference" and suggests that Norah is giving herself "the
gift of freedom." While Tom looks into whether Norah has suffered
some sort of trauma, Reta speculates that she has begun to perceive
the limits of her gender. "A deterioration has occurred to the fabric
of the world, the world that does not belong to her as she has been
told."</TE>
<TE>   Winters is comforted by three women friends she meets weekly for
coffee. They discuss acts of goodness as ethical choices--what about
the newspaper image of a woman giving birth in a tree during a flood
in Mozambique--"What did we do about that? Did we transform our shock
into goodness?" one of them asks. Another mentions the Muslim woman
who set herself on fire in downtown Toronto. "Someone did try to help
her .... Someone tried to beat out the flames. A woman." They worry
that Westerman is right, that women are doomed to "goodness but not
greatness."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, Winters thinks, her daughter is pursuing "a process of
self-extinction" that parallels Westerman's theory that "inversion is
... the tactic of the powerless, a retreat from society that borders
on the catatonic." She considers Westerman's lifework: "What does her
shelf of books amount to, what force have these books had upon the
world?" She thinks about the books her daughters read in school.
"Imagine someone writing a play called 'Death of a Saleswoman.'"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Winters is at work on a sequel to her novel. One
deliciously tart element in "Unless" is a satiric romp through a
series of set pieces from a writer's life: The author interview, in
which a book columnist asks hideously invasive questions about her
daughter ("he was the barking terrier, going at [my] ankles"), then
allows her to pick up the tab, confiding that, like most journalists,
he is underpaid; the book-signing ("My impulse was to apologize for
not being younger and more adorable, like Alicia in my novel"); the
winning of the Offenden prize, which damns her to minor status by
honoring accessibility ("A beginning, a middle and an ending ... is
that too much to ask?" is its motto); and the encounter with the
boorish young editor who wants her to reframe the sequel with a male
protagonist--under a male pseudonym--because, she realizes, he can't
imagine a woman being the moral center of a novel or a female author
writing a serious book.</TE>
<TE>   As Winters struggles through this thicket of despair and comes to
hard-won insights about her daughter's enigmatic behavior and her own
place in the world, Shields carries us into a moment of illumination
not unlike the ending Winters visualizes for her novel: " ... the
gathering together of all the characters into a framed operatic
circle of consolation and ecstasy, backlit with fiber-optic gold,
just for a moment on the second-to-last page, just for an atomic
particle of time."</TE>
<TE>   Like Winters, Shields has the wisdom to know that in art, as in
life, this harmonious design will quickly be supplanted. "We only
appear to be rooted in time," she writes. "Everywhere, if you listen
closely, the spitting fuse of the future is crackling."</TE>
<TE>   In this consummately artistic and poignant novel, Shields touches
gently upon some of life's harshest surprises, acknowledges the
fleetingness of happiness and reminds us how precious life is.</TE>

<DH>PERPETUAL WAR FOR PERPETUAL PEACE: How We Got to Be So
Hated, By Gore Vidal, Thunder's Mouth Press / Nation Books: 160 pp.,
$10 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC COOPER</AU>
<BD>Marc Cooper is the author of "Pinochet and Me: A
Chilean Anti-Memoir." He is a contributing editor to the Nation
magazine and an editor at large for L.A. Weekly.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comparing the work of Gore Vidal--22 novels, five plays, numerous
screenplays and hundreds of essays--with, say, the highly publicized
grumblings of Cornel West over whether Harvard or Princeton was a
more congenial academic environment for an African American
professor, one is reminded of what it means to be a truly vital and
consequential public intellectual.</LD>
<LD>   Vidal, 76, takes special gusto in discharging that function: For
decades he has been ready to scold any of the powerful who might
deign to sit across the table from him. And if not, he's just as
happy to stay at his preferred home in Italy and lob his polemical
grenades across the seas.</LD>
<LD>   From the early 1960s through the late 1980s (until age slowed
him), Vidal spent much time on the David Susskind show and later
touring American college campuses, offering lacerating "alternative"
State of the Union addresses. In his wickedly sardonic trademark
style, Vidal would always narrow down to the same two complementary
points: The U.S. should cease meddling in the business of other
nations and in the private lives of its citizens.</LD>
<TE>   Cadging a phrase from historian Charles A. Beard for its title,
Vidal's latest book, "Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace," argues that
our nation's interventionist impulse answers the prevalent post-Sept.
11 question: Why do "they" hate us so much? This unevenly stitched
together collection of essays (some previously published in the
Nation and Vanity Fair with a centerpiece rejected by the Nation)
posits that we have no right to scratch our heads over what motivated
the perpetrators of the two biggest terrorist attacks in our history,
the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and last September's twin tower and
Pentagon holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal writes: "It is a law of physics (still on the books when
last I looked) that in nature there is no action without reaction.
The same appears to be true in human nature--that is, history." The
"action" that Vidal refers to is the hubris of an American empire
abroad (illustrated by a 19-page chart of 200 U.S. overseas military
adventures since the end of World War II) and a budding police state
at home. The inevitable "reaction," says Vidal, is nothing less than
the bloody handiwork of Osama bin Laden and Timothy McVeigh. "Each
was enraged," he says, "by our government's reckless assaults upon
other societies" and was "provoked" into answering with horrendous
violence.</TE>
<TE>   In Bin Laden's case, the terrorist attack was a response to a U.S.
policy that one-sidedly backed Israel, satanized Saddam Hussein,
defiled the Saudi holy land with American troops and demonstrated an
"imperial disdain" for the Muslim world. As to McVeigh, the
detonator, Vidal argues, was an increasingly arrogant and militarized
collection of federal law enforcement agencies--from the IRS to the
FBI to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms--which jack-booted
it from Ruby Ridge to Waco.</TE>
<TE>   Is Vidal clucking that the chickens have come home to roost, that
thousands of innocent American civilians deserved to be
indiscriminately targeted in Oklahoma and New York and then murdered
for the sins of their government? Vidal certainly cracks open the
door to that interpretation, and no doubt a lot of readers will waltz
right through.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Nation magazine, to which Vidal is a contributing editor
(as am I), rejected his essay on Sept. 11 that then became the book's
opener, probably because it skated too close to gloating over the
pain inflicted on the U.S. But that's far too simplistic a reading of
Vidal, who, for all his fulminating against "our ruling junta," is,
at bottom, quite a patriot. He writes not from hatred but from a
profound love betrayed and defiled, proudly casting himself as a
noble defender of "the American Republic against the American Global
Empire."</TE>
<TE>   And whatever one concludes about the real or imagined motivations
of Bin Laden and McVeigh, Vidal's greater points about the erosion of
the Jeffersonian vision of the American nation should be well
taken--especially in these grim times.</TE>
<TE>   If we reap anything of collective value from the horrors of
Oklahoma City and Sept. 11, it ought to be more than self-reassuring
nostrums that Bin Laden is simply evil and McVeigh's just a lone
wacko. In what he calls these "United States of Amnesia," Vidal
argues that the darker side of our official histories is
ritualistically bowdlerized by a timid media. And the rightful shock
and trauma experienced by the American people on Sept. 11, he says,
must be viewed and experienced in the broader context of what our
nation's behavior has been toward the rest of the world. When
President Bush, masterfully demeaned by Vidal as a "sill-billy,"
proclaims you are either with us or against us, Vidal responds:
"That's known as asking for it."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, Vidal frets over how the attacks--both in Oklahoma City
and on Sept. 11--have been politically exploited to roll back civil
liberties and amplify the power of an already overly intrusive
federal government. Before the rubble could be cleared around the
Murrah Federal Building, the Clinton administration rushed to enact,
under the banner of fighting terrorism, the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Though it, rather obviously, did little to deter terrorism, the
measure shredded long-standing rights to appeal capital sentences.
Then comes near-unanimous Senate passage (99-1) of the onerous USA
Patriot Act just weeks after Sept. 11, ensuring an assault on basic
rights of due process and privacy. "The awesome physical damage Osama
and company did us is as nothing compared to the knock-out blow to
our vanishing liberties," Vidal writes. "Once alienated, an
'unalienable right' is apt to be forever lost."</TE>
<TE>   Vidal's suggestion that American liberty will turn out to be the
greatest victim of Sept. 11 may or may not be hyperbole. And yes,
while I share his repugnance at state-sponsored executions, Vidal
waxes far too sympathetic about McVeigh, whom he describes as an
idealist whose "excessive sense of justice" detoured into mayhem
after the outrageous barbecuing of more than 80 people in the 1993
federal siege at Waco, Texas. Rather than libertarian opponents to a
militarized federal state, McVeigh and his militia cohorts are much
more the gun-worshiping children of military culture. McVeigh and
friends would not oppose military dictatorship, so long as they
directed it.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do I find very convincing Vidal's prescription for what the
proper response to the perpetrators of Sept. 11 should have been. He
suggests sending U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to negotiate a
grand detente between the fundamentalists and us, the infidels. I
found the work of the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division in
Afghanistan to be more appropriate and effective. But so what? Vidal
pretends to be neither a policy wonk nor a military strategist, and
he spends little more than a few paragraphs in arguing for what
should be done to Bin Laden. Instead, he's a powerful, urgently
needed and near lone voice of national conscience.</TE>
<TE>   The suffocating and self-indulgent consensus in which most of
America has swaddled itself since Sept. 11, reinforced by
cable-babble framed in patriotic bunting and unquestioned by
"opposition" Democrats who purr like a collection of domestic pets on
Dubya's Crawford, Texas, ranch, could use a bit of shouting down by
the likes of Vidal. And if someone wants to shout back half as
eloquently as Vidal, then please hop to it. That way we'd have at
least the semblance of a grand national debate.</TE>

<HD>Piercing the Surface</HD>
<DH>PUNK: The Definitive Record of a Revolution, By Stephen
Colegrave and Chris Sullivan, Thunder's Mouth Press: 400 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CASEY DOLAN</AU>
<BD>Casey Dolan is aTimes feature desk assistant, recording
artist and record producer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Punk was a cultural movement without a clear agenda, but it had a
manic, volcanic energy and a sense of urgent necessity when it
exploded in the mid-1970s. Initially it was a visually bold and
provocative reaction to pop culture, but eventually punk became
corrupted because its more ephemeral elements--the hair, the
clothes--were easy for mainstream culture to co-opt as a "fashion
trend."</LD>
<LD>   Chris Sullivan, coauthor with Stephen Colegrave of "Punk: The
Definitive Record of a Revolution," writes that he was "convinced
that the successful spread of punk per se was more to do with the
style than the music.... It was the look that attracted a lot of
people. That is certainly true for me."</LD>
<LD>   That emphasis on surface over substance explains why the book
holds up so well as a photographic document but less so as a cultural
analysis. After the obligatory nod to such musical precedents as Iggy
Pop, the Ramones and the Velvet Underground and acknowledging the
debt to such early bedfellows as the surrealists and dadaists, "Punk"
moves through the glory days from 1975 to 1979 with occasionally
astonishing and rare photos, accompanied by commentary from the
players new and old.</LD>
<TE>   England receives the greatest emphasis, and New York City is a
close second, particularly as punk's incubator. But America's West
Coast scene (bands like X, the Dead Kennedys, the Germs, Black Flag)
is never mentioned--odd in a book that considers itself
"definitive"--nor any other punk scene, for that matter. There is
spiky-haired scamp Johnny Rotten (ne John Lydon) encouraging mayhem
onstage with the Sex Pistols. Malcolm McLaren, the Pistols'
controversial and brilliant manager, has the air of a young Irish
bookie, wheeling and dealing and exploiting disaster. Vivienne
Westwood, the grande dame of punk fashion and proprietress of the
clothing boutique Sex, comes off as den mother to this pack of wolf
cubs and thrift-store dandies.</TE>
<TE>   Some portraits are surprisingly revealing: a happy and healthy
Lydon relaxing in Jamaica with reggae singer Big Youth; New York
Dolls' and Heartbreakers' guitarist Johnny Thunders, reclining,
eyelids at half-mast, exhausted or stoned; candid shots on tour with
the Clash, Pistols and Heartbreakers--pillow fights in the hotel
rooms, waiting for sound check, beers in the pub after the show.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the constant threat of self-annihilation that permeated
the scene, nearly everyone survived and is still around today,
although you might not be able to tell from "Punk." Noticeably absent
from the compendium of quotations are any current observations from
nearly all of the major players--Lydon, McLaren, Westwood, Joe
Strummer (the Clash), Siouxsie Sioux, Pete Shelley (the Buzzcocks),
Dave Vanian (the Damned). Instead, we read commentary from everyone
else in the bands, journalists, managers, roadies, club owners and a
seemingly endless array of fans, parasites, loiterers. Lydon is quite
outspoken in other places nowadays. Why not in this book?</TE>
<TE>   There are some surprises, however. Paul Cook, the Pistols'
drummer, comes off as a practical fellow, as does Glen Matlock, the
original Pistols' bassist. "We'd been rehearsing hard," Matlock said.
"I'd been accepted to do my degree in fine art at St. Martin's, but
we'd all decided to take the band seriously.... I became social
secretary of the St. Martin's College Union. I booked the Pistols for
a gig, and that was that." Others convey the humor and lunacy that
existed, including "Punk's" authors as well as Nils Stevenson, the
Pistols' tour manager and Siouxsie and the Banshees' manager.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, much of the partisan backbiting that plagued
(and continues to plague) the music is present. To this day,
musicians must face absurd standards of "street credibility." Who is
punk enough? What carries authenticity? The Buzzcocks were
fundamentally a pop band with melodic hooks, ingenious song
constructions and a lyricist of great wit in Shelley. They just
happened to play loud and dress in black. Unfortunately, the lines
are drawn sharply in many of the quotes and still, decades after the
fact, carry some nastiness.</TE>
<TE>   Minor factual errors are to be found, the most comical of which is
a photograph of several Ramones, Seymour Stein (president of Sire
Records) and his wife, and an "unidentified man" (according to the
caption) who is clearly Elton John, a friend of Stein's.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths of Sid Vicious and his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, are a
macabre chapter in the history, and there are some interesting side
trips to reggae, ska and dub--each of which played enormous roles in
English popular musical culture and relatively minor ones in America.
These are not what make this book compelling. In the end, it is the
photographs and the visual image of punk.</TE>

<DH>PORTRAITS 9/11/01: The Collected 'Portraits of Grief' from
the New York Times, Foreword by  Howell Raines, Introduction by Janny
Scott, Henry Holt: 688 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA EMERSON</AU>
<BD>Gloria Emerson is the author, most recently, of "Loving
Graham Greene: A Novel" and "Winners &amp; Losers," an account of the
Vietnam War that won a National Book Award.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not everyone shared the sorrow or the shock of Sept. 11. An English
journalist remarked afterward that he had found the abundance of
American flags "embarrassing." An English friend of mine said he knew
someone who found the American mourning "excessive."</LD>
<LD>   But nothing was as jolting as an essay written by the French
writer, Jean Baudrillard, that appeared in Le Monde last November and
in Harper's magazine in February. Baudrillard wrote: "That the entire
world without exception had dreamed of this event, that nobody could
help but dream the destruction of so powerful a hegemon--this fact is
unacceptable to the moral conscience of the West, and yet it is a
fact nonetheless, a fact that resists the emotional violence of all
the rhetoric conspiring to erase it."</LD>
<LD>   And then this sentence: "In the end, it was they who did it but we
who wished it."</LD>
<TE>   It is impossible not to feel bitter about these words, looking at
the extraordinary book published by the New York Times of the little
profiles of the dead it published in the months following the attack.
The book, "Portraits: 9/11/01," is a collection of 1,900 informal
obituaries that were printed in a section the Times called "A Nation
Challenged." They were wonderful snapshots, full of tiny telling
details about the deceased. They let us see, as Howell Raines, the
executive editor of the paper, has written in the foreword, "the
subtle nobility of everyday existence, of the ordered beauty of
quotidian life for millions of Americans .... "</TE>
<TE>   Raines recalls how reporters were seen crying at their telephones;
143 of them did the interviews and wrote the pieces. As Janny Scott,
reporter on the metropolitan desk, writes in her introduction, "it
was heartbreaking work." It went on until early this year. Some
families refused to take part or could not or wanted to wait.</TE>
<TE>   The sweetness of these severed lives is overpowering: Children,
jobs, cars, hobbies and passions colored these lives so beautifully.
We can look in their faces in the little pictures and see how full of
life they were, how eager they were to get on with it. Surely our
critics would see that they were not titans of capitalism, not people
to be slaughtered because of a government's policies and wrongdoings.
Scott recalls the reader who sent an email saying: "Never before in
my forty-plus years as a reader have I been moved to close my eyes,
place my palm on the page of a newspaper, shed a tear and say a
prayer."</TE>
<TE>   So many of the dead were young, and not all of them were making
money, although a majority were traders and brokers. Many had humbler
jobs. We remember the firemen, who earned our love, and know they
were never well paid. Often the voices of family members or friends
or colleagues can be heard in these portraits, and their words
shimmer with a thankfulness at having known the murdered person, and
the stories they tell are lovely and often funny. Some of them crack
open the heart.</TE>
<TE>   After I finished reading "Portraits: 9/11/01," I felt calmer about
the essay by Baudrillard. But I wish I could send him the book with a
note that says: Is this what you wished for?</TE>

<TE>   On September 11, 2001, Rancho Santa Margarita resident Lisa Frost
was a passenger on the ill-fated United Airlines Flight 175.</TE>
<TE>   When Boston University went to California to recruit Lisa Frost,
she fell in love with the school. By the time Miss Frost was in her
junior year at B.U. she was traveling the West Coast talking about
the university and doing the recruiting herself. She graduated in May
2001 with two degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody that comes in contact with her is just so inspired and
so motivated," said her father, Tom Frost. On the B.U. Web site there
are more than 80 messages sent in by people who knew Miss Frost and
many who didn't but were touched by the story of how she died while
taking a flight to begin her career at home in California.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Frost recently planted a 13-foot scrub oak near his home in
Rancho Santa Margarita in honor of his 22-year-old daughter [and]
placed a granite plaque ... detailing her life, her death and all the
lives she touched.</TE>

<TE>   You probably think you know Firefighter Joseph E. Maloney. Son of
a cop, grandson of a fireman; married forever to Kathy, the pretty,
tough-talking nurse; father of Joe, 10, and Megan, 7.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, you know Firefighter Maloney, 45, of Farmingville, N.Y. He
is the tall, dark and handsome type who keeps the muscles pumped and
the prankster side buffed. Every firehouse has one--or a dozen--like
him.</TE>
<TE>   You know him? Not at all. Meet Firefighter Maloney, who never
mentioned fear or death, who cared more about being a hero dad than a
hero firefighter, although he was both.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Mrs. Maloney was going through paperwork ... and found a
note, stuck between the kids' birth certificates, dated 1995. "Honey,
if I die and if on the F.D.N.Y.," he wrote, "you will fare O.K." Tax
instructions followed, and an admonition to a giddy shopper: "Don't
spend a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   It concludes: "I love you, Joseph and Megan. Sorry I had to leave
you so early."</TE>

<DH>SHAKEY: Neil Young's Biography, By Jimmy McDonough, Random
House: 788 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HAL ESPEN</AU>
<BD>Hal Espen is the editor of Outside Magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like dreams, our musical enthusiasms color, reflect, organize and
enchant our lives. But everybody knows what happens when you try to
communicate those dreams to someone else. Writing about musical
passions can put a similar strain on the patience of your audience.
For someone like me, who loves Neil Young's music with a deep and
abiding passion--for someone who shares the dream--Jimmy McDonough's
fat, teeming, obsessive and revelatory biography of Young is a pure
shot of all-access pleasure.</LD>
<LD>   Even for a fan, however, reading "Shakey" is something of a trial.
The book is picayune, tedious, annoying and exhausting, part endless
biopic and part clip job--a bulging portmanteau of solid biographical
writing, jousting conversations between Young and the author,
rock-press scrapbook fragments, music criticism of wildly uneven
quality and inane celebrity testimonials. (Willie Nelson: "He's more
than a writer, more than a singer, he's an entertainer.") "Shakey" is
cliche-ridden ("I wanted to find out what made him tick") yet hugely
original, a paradoxically compromised "authorized" biography that
manages to serve up an astonishing amount of dirt on its subject.</LD>
<TE>   For culture warriors who hate the '60s, "Shakey" (Young has
adopted the joke name Bernard Shakey for his generally horrible work
as a movie director) will be a house of horrors that confirms their
worst suspicions about the Pied Pipers of the counterculture. The
book lovingly documents decades of shameless, unrepentant drug use,
drinking, debauchery and rampant egotism. (It probably won't help
that the reliably perverse Young has been a staunch Reagan supporter
and proponent of the death penalty, as well as a devoted husband and
a stalwart parent to three kids, two of whom were born with cerebral
palsy.)</TE>
<TE>   Casual fans of Young's "mellow" hits, such as his only No. 1
album, "Harvest" (1972), won't find much comfort in "Shakey" either.
McDonough is a fierce proponent of Young's loudest, roughest, most
abrasive experiments in music. And for women of a certain age, the
antics of the perpetually partying musician and his friends may
present a picture of an arrogant hippie loutishness they'd rather not
contemplate. (Young's most committed admirers are almost invariably
male; peruse any Neil Young fan gathering or Web site and you'll find
a world that is virtually devoid of women.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, once you filter out all the dreck, what Young's story
offers for even the agnostic reader is a riveting case study of the
cost of long-running artistic vitality and, in McDonough's telling, a
sustained consideration of the irreducible tensions between critic
and fan. A crank and fanatic in the Lester Bangs mold, McDonough
stalks Young through the book like a bad conscience, and it seems
clear that this edginess is what attracted and later alienated Young.</TE>
<TE>   "Shakey" has its roots in two tour de force articles McDonough
wrote about Young for the Village Voice and Spin in 1989 and 1990,
just as Young was emerging from a bad run of emotional problems,
business conflicts and a decade of botched but intermittently
brilliant albums. Traumatized by a futile quest to find an effective
treatment for his youngest son's severe disabilities, Young had
sought refuge in a series of personas: an obsessive-compulsive ranter
in his "Re-ac-tor" album (1981), a cyborg-singer in "Trans" (1982), a
rockabilly doofus in "Everybody's Rockin'" (1983), a herky-jerky
country rube in "Old Ways" (1985) and an enraged synth-god in
"Landing on Water" (1986). True believers couldn't figure out why
this amazing guitar avatar who was still making fantastic music on
stage kept putting out lame records. Something strange was taking
place between the studio and the stage, and fans simply had to take
it in stride.</TE>
<TE>   By 1989, however, Young seemed on the verge of a new start, and
McDonough was there both to upbraid him for his failings and spur him
on. "Too Far Gone," his piece for the Village Voice, was a thrilling,
confrontational, anti-professional feat of real-rock journalism, with
the writer functioning as the surrogate for Young fans who felt
betrayed by their hero but ready to forgive all. McDonough hectored,
badgered and mocked Young to his face, and Young (who once said he'd
never been to a therapist, adding "They're real interested in me,
though") responded by talking honestly about his lost decade. When
McDonough pushed his buttons--"If I hear 'Sugar Mountain' one more
time, I'm buying a gun"--Young just laughed. McDonough didn't just
capture the reemergence of a "frighteningly alive" popular artist but
somehow almost became a catalyst for that reemergence.</TE>
<TE>   By the time McDonough wrote about the making of "Ragged Glory"
(one of Young's best albums) for Spin the following year, he had
joined the outer orbit of Young's inner circle. Young, maybe seeing
some of his own pugnacious, willful, contrarian self in McDonough--or
maybe just displaying a sly talent for co-opting his best
critic--recruited the journalist to write the liner notes for a
gargantuan multi-CD collection of old, unreleased and live music that
was due to arrive at the beginning of the 1990s (and, to this day, is
rumored to grow vaster with every year it fails to appear). In August
1991, McDonough and Young signed a contract with Random House to
produce a biography, with Young reportedly receiving nearly 20% of
the advance payment.</TE>
<TE>   There would be trouble ahead.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough is superb at describing and evoking Young's childhood,
family dynamics and his youth. Born in Toronto in 1945, the son of a
famous sportswriter father and an irascible sardonic housewife
mother, Young had an upbringing that was idyllic and shot through
with trauma. Struck with polio at 5, he spent a significant stretch
of time as an invalid. His parents went through a painful divorce in
his early teens; the experience seems to have sharpened his hunger
for self-reliance and hastened his passage into the journeyman life
of a musician.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in Los Angeles on April Fool's Day in 1966, 20-year-old
Young almost instantaneously became a star in Buffalo Springfield.
Two years later he was making his first solo album and, by 1969, as a
member of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, he was a superstar. In
1970, just 24, he bought a sprawling mountain ranch south of San
Francisco for $340,000 in cash, a prince on his way to becoming a pop
king.</TE>
<TE>   "Shakey" takes almost half of its nearly 800 pages to get this
far; the second half fractures in a kaleidoscope of rock-star
shenanigans. McDonough is often more successful writing about various
supporting actors--like Young's driven, hard-living, Dionysian
producer, David Briggs--than he is with Shakey himself. But Young
didn't make it easy for him. After signing the book contract, he made
a point of becoming all but inaccessible to his Boswell. It was
hardly shocking behavior from a guy who once declared, "As soon as
you start talking about mystique, you have none."</TE>
<TE>   But elusiveness has always been Young's MO. Throughout his career,
he has struggled to remain true to his instincts and his gift by
embracing compulsive change; popularity be damned. (His latest album,
"Are You Passionate?," is at best an honest snapshot of a momentary
slump, at worst a lump of callous product). This struggle has also
been the central subject of his oeuvre and the constant preoccupation
in his lyrics and his bewildering career shifts.</TE>
<TE>   In "Thrasher," one of Young's best songs, the singer's credo of
escape is gorgeously dramatized in a landscape of looming mortality
where the temptations of habit and self-indulgence and the sure thing
are duly contemplated and bypassed. He sees his generation of
musicians ossified in "rock formations"; traverses "the windy halls
of friendship" where "the motel of lost companions/Waits with heated
pool and bar" but chooses "a one-way ticket to the land of truth" and
the loner's open road.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his music, Young's aesthetic strategy of constant
veering has influenced a long list of rockers trying to avoid dying
before they get old, from Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan to R.E.M.
and Wilco. But has anyone else practiced Young's cruel art with such
breathtaking heartlessness, walking out on recording sessions and
concert tours when the feeling's not right? As McDonough points out,
Young's on-again, off-again band, Crazy Horse, has spent long
periods--years--waiting for Young to decide if he's ready for another
go-round with them. (During one protracted lull, they released a
record titled "Left for Dead.") Take this strategy, add a cocktail of
heroin and depression, and you have Kurt Cobain, quoting from Young's
anthem to mutable intensity, "My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)," in
his suicide note ("I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember,
it's better to burn out than to fade away") before picking up a
shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's no mystery, then, that "Shakey" embodies the
contradiction between Young's ambition to memorialize himself and his
profound fear of being buried in the past. In any case, "Shakey"
peters out in the fall of 1996, when Young decided he'd had enough,
cut off McDonough's access and floated the idea that he'd like to buy
out the book contract and quash the project. Two years later,
McDonough completed the book, and Young apparently began doing
everything he could to kill it. In May 2000, McDonough sued Young for
$1.8 million in a campaign to free his book.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the only pop star ever sued and blocked from releasing
albums by his label for making albums that were "musically
uncharacteristic of [his] previous recordings"--as Young was by
Geffen in the mid-1980s--ended up being sued by his own official
biographer. "Young," the lawsuit charged, "revealed himself to be a
contradiction in terms." The suit was settled last October, clearing
the way for the publication of "Shakey." The book is dedicated to two
people, one of them McDonough's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   After reading "Shakey," I was left wondering if McDonough had
emerged from the experience of chasing down his idol with his
enthusiasm and affection for Young's music intact. As an erstwhile
rock critic, I used to dream about meeting Young and writing about
him. Now I'm glad it never happened. I don't think I'd like Young
very much, and even if he didn't turn out to be the mean, ruthless
creep "Shakey" proves he's capable of being, I'd prefer not to have
the Neil Young I love through his music displaced by the real thing.
McDonough uses a line from one of Young's masterpieces,
"Powderfinger," as his book's epigraph--"Just think of me as one you
never figured"--without including the lines that follow: "Would fade
away so young/With so much left undone." The great thing about the
song is that it works both ways.</TE>

<LD>A phantom limb is flesh become memory, which in turn becomes the
illusion of flesh. A person who has had an arm or leg cut off may
feel it ache or itch as if it were still there. The severed nerves
keep relaying reports to the brain from lost outposts, the way light
from dead stars still reaches our eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Janet Sternburg's mother, Helen, battling circulation problems
before her death, had first one leg, then the other, amputated.
Sternburg's father, Samuel, had died earlier after a series of
strokes. "Phantom Limb," the memoir, begins as the author's attempt
to research the phenomenon of phantom limb, which caused her mother
considerable pain. It ends with Sternburg using the phenomenon as a
metaphor for the loss of our loved ones, who remain intimately with
us even after they're gone.</LD>
<LD>   "[T]he pain of the human condition is death, the one condition we
never get over," says Sternburg, a poet, essayist and photographer
who teaches at the California Institute for the Arts (where her
husband, Steven D. Lavine, is president). "And it means we all lose
parts of ourselves along the way. No one survives intact. No one is
exempt. In that democracy of sorrow lies our consolation."</LD>
<TE>   As in poetry, the language in this short book is compressed and
suggestive; like an exhibit of still photography, it consists of
sharp, cropped, seemingly disconnected images. Its portraits of
Sternburg's parents, lower-middle-class Boston Jews--the father a
grocer and cab driver prone to explosions of temper; the mother
cultivating a love of beauty beyond her means--at first strike us as
frustratingly incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Then we get a feel for Sternburg's method. The odd, out-of-context
detail dropped into one chapter is explained in the next. A long-dead
relative--"the oldest person ever to receive a graduate degree from
Harvard"--is contrasted, apparently as a joke, with "the lobotomized
end of the family spectrum." It turns out, however, that two of the
mother's siblings--a schizophrenic brother and a suicidal
sister--really were given frontal lobotomies and lived on for years
with "the family that did this to them." They looked "like zombies,"
phantoms of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, though, the portraits are incomplete because of the
inevitable gaps in Sternburg's memory. She consults a professor of
neurology at UCLA. "When I'm trying to recall my parents' living
room," she tells him, "I feel as though I'm searching for an image
that already exists in me."</TE>
<TE>   "It may feel that way," he answers, "but there's no place in your
brain where the living room exists, no permanently held picture of a
sofa. Very little is stored in the brain.... Instead, think of your
memories as connections constantly being made and unmade among
synapses. The living room is delivered to you only during the window
of time when you're reconstructing it." It's as if the hulk of the
Titanic on the sea floor didn't exist except during the moments when
submersibles flashed their lights on its rusting plates, just as a
phantom limb exists only in the nerves' messages. To some extent, we
create the dead who live on in us, and the very scarcity and
unreliability of our memories makes them precious.</TE>
<TE>   Sternburg discovers that her search for consolation involves an
acceptance of the pain of loss--the gaps along with the memories.
After her mother's first amputation, the lost leg hurt--yet the
experience of phantom limb, Sternburg learned, is "essential for
walking. When a prosthesis is strapped on, the phantom shoots out and
'fills' it. The brain then begins to accept the artificial leg as
though it were part of the body."</TE>
<TE>   She considers the case of Madame I., a Frenchwoman a century ago
who suffered from "general insensibility," an inability to feel any
part of her body, even to hear her own voice. Sternburg imagines a
scene in which Madame I. has recovered enough to feel the pain of a
fall and gladly accepts this as the price for experiencing "the taste
of food ... the scent of flowers" and hearing the voices of her
children at last.</TE>

<LD>THE GREAT PANCAKE ESCAPE</LD>
<LD>   By Paul Many</LD>
<LD>   Illustrated by Scott Goto</LD>
<TE>   Walker &amp; Co.: 32 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   After a magician father bungles breakfast, magical hotcakes lead
three hungry children on a wild chase in this rhyming tale of pancake
pursuit: "We had no chance to stop them/as they leaped up on their
edges,/skittered quickly out the door,/and rolled right past the
hedges." The children (and readers) spot the fleeing flapjacks posing
as manhole covers, dog Frisbees and wheels on in-line skates, and at
one point, in an apparent nod to Magritte, they serve as umbrellas
for some bowler-hatted citizens. At last, a backward spell summons
the pancakes home.</TE>
<TE>   In his first picture book, young adult novelist Paul Many ("These
Are the Rules") employs rhythmic, playful verse (the cakes take wing
and become "batter-flies" at one point); an author's note points out
that the words can be sung to the tune of "O, Susanna." An uneven
font enclosed in blobs of batter reflects the frenzy of the hotcake
hunt, as do Scott Goto's ("Heat Wave!") dizzying close-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Far from appetizing in appearance, the gaping mouths and wide eyes
on both people and animals, and Goto's use of browns and eerie greens
lend a portentous feel. And some parts are almost spooky. For
example, the father sports a fiendish smile and wild gaze when spell
casting amid flames and smoke. The hyperbolic art proves a curiously
unsettling accompaniment for this escapist tale. (Ages 5-8)</TE>

<TE>   SIXTEEN COWS</TE>
<TE>   By Lisa Wheeler</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Kurt Cyrus</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt: 38 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   Romance on the range is inevitable after a tornado destroys a
fence, and a cowgirl's eight cows mix with a cowboy's matching herd.
But the neighbors don't take to each other right quick. Sue Waddle,
who rides a palomino and twirls a mean lariat, tries to coax her
Holsteins back to her property. " 'Don't mingle with those low-down
cows,' she cried. 'That just won't do!'/She broke into her come-home
song ... but Gene was singing, too." Gene Biddle, who drives a pickup
and wears a big black hat, yells for his cattle and lures Sue's as
well. The stubborn ranchers compete ("'I'm singin' all my cows back
home!'/ 'I'm singin' mine home, too!'/And sixteen cows in unison
responded with a 'Moo!'"), until they realize that they and their
livestock are meant to be together.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Cyrus ("Oddhopper Opera") uses the horizontal layouts to good
effect in expansive watercolors of the golden prairie, and he
observes every detail of Gene's wood stove, Sue's buckskin duds and
the udder-shaped latex-glove balloons at the wedding. But his
galloping cows have more comic personality than the cowhands, whose
melding of hearts takes place offstage. Still, Lisa Wheeler's ("Wool
Gathering: A Sheep Family Reunion") rubbery rhymes and humorous lists
of cow-names keep the pages turning at a lively clip. (Ages 3-7)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MR. WOLF AND THE THREE BEARS</TE>
<TE>   By Jan Fearnley</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt: 32 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Wolf, who enjoyed flapjacks with a side order of Chicken
Little in "Mr. Wolf's Pancakes," is an easygoing chef with a
take-no-prisoners approach to etiquette. In another archly hilarious
gathering of nursery characters, he now prepares a birthday feast for
Baby Bear, with help from Grandma.</TE>
<TE>   When the Three Bears arrive, "someone barged in front of them! It
was Goldilocks!" A smirking girl stands in the doorway with eyes
narrowed. "She said she was invited, too," Daddy Bear protests,
fiddlingwith his tie. The hosts frown uncomfortably while the blond
bully stuffs her face with Huff Puff Cakes and Cheesy Snipsnaps
(recipes are provided, along with a plug for a Mr. Wolf Web site). To
distract Baby Bear, who weeps, Grandma calls for a game of
hide-and-seek, "but no hiding in the kitchen, please."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Goldilocks fails to reappear. "Never mind," says
Grandma, carrying in a huge, steaming hot pie, crimped in a familiar
curly design. "She's gone now, and I've made us a special treat to
celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   With her wry humor, Jan Fearnley does not reveal the mystery
filling of the "golden" dessert in either text or illustrations.
Readers will relish the satisfying, wicked twist; party crashers,
beware. (Ages 3-7)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ANGELO</TE>
<TE>   By David Macaulay</TE>
<TE>   Houghton/Lorraine: 48 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   Despite his "professional dislike" for birds, an elderly plasterer
named Angelo carries home an injured pigeon he comes across while
restoring the exterior of a church. "I restore walls, not pigeons,"
he grumbles, but an unlikely friendship springs up as he nurses
Sylvia back to health. Later, she returns the favor: When she sees
that he moves a bit more slowly, she sticks around to "coo
encouragement," fanning him with her wings on hot days and
entertaining him at lunchtime. David Macaulay ("Building Big"; "Rome
Antics") knows how to get the most humor out of his illustrations,
both in the finer details (Angelo and Sylvia sporting matching red
scarves in winter) and the broader strokes (as Angelo tells Sylvia of
the church's restoration as his "crowning achievement," he imagines
the building's facade glimmering in glory, while she imagines pigeons
perching on every available surface). He thus balances the melancholy
elements of the tale with moments of lightness. Angelo's swan song to
Sylvia is especially poignant. Macaulay's artwork conveys respect for
Angelo's talent, and the artist wedges a good deal of architecture
and sculpture into his watercolors. Though the setting goes unnamed,
the rust-colored tile roofs and other details make it clear that
readers have been whisked to Italy. (All ages)</TE>

<AU>JULIUS LESTER</AU>
<BD>Julius Lester is the author of numerous books,
including "When Dad Killed Mom," and teaches Judaic studies and
history at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was in high school, there was a small group of us who liked
jazz. I don't recall how we discovered it in the Nashville, Tenn., of
the mid-1950s, but in the sounds of the Count Basie Orchestra,
Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Clifford Brown and Max Roach we
heard statements about living that were far different from those in
the banjos and steel guitars of the country music for which Nashville
was famous.</LD>
<LD>   Bebop had the exhilaration of an improvisatory order being imposed
on a chaos that could be controlled only to the extent and only as
long as one plunged into it. It was one cultural response to the
giddiness of the postwar economic expansion accompanied by the Cold
War against a communist enemy and the ever-present possibility of a
nuclear war that could end human life on the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Another and almost opposite cultural response was found in the
"cool" sound of what came to be known as West Coast jazz. Where
Parker and Gillespie would leave one breathless with the number of
notes they could play on one breath, "cool" jazz made silence an
integral part of the music and showed that one held note was as
expressive as the 10 Parker or Gillespie would have played in the
same time.</LD>
<TE>   "Cool" jazz was both more controlled and more melodic than bebop,
attributes that made it more accessible and appealing to white
audiences. For a brief few years in the '50s, no one exemplified cool
jazz more than the white trumpeter and vocalist Chet Baker. The
biography "Deep in a Dream" by James Gavin and Bill Moody's mystery,
"Looking for Chet Baker," describe vividly the paradoxical existence
of a man who created art of ineffable beauty while simultaneously
living a sordid and self-destructive life.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1929 in Oklahoma, Baker moved with his parents to the Los
Angeles area in 1940. His father, a failed musician, bought him his
first instrument, a trombone, and later a trumpet when Baker found
the trombone too big to handle. Because music came as naturally to
the young Baker as breathing, he could scarcely read a score and was
never known to practice. He only had to hear a melody once to be able
to play it back flawlessly. Baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, with
whom Baker teamed in 1952 to make some of his best recordings,
describes him in "Deep in a Dream" as an idiot savant, "a kind of
freak talent. I've never been around anybody who had a quicker
relationship between his ears and his fingers." Ruth Young, one of
Baker's many abused lovers, went further: "You gotta realize, Chet
was not that intelligent. He did not know what he was doing.... He
just did it."</TE>
<TE>   Baker's reputation grew when, at 23, he played with Parker on the
great alto saxophonist's West Coast tour. In 1953 and 1955, Baker was
voted the top trumpet player by the readers of Down Beat, the jazz
magazine. Black musicians derided him as the "Great White Hope" and
wondered if Baker really believed he was a better musician than Louis
Armstrong, Miles Davis, Gillespie and Brown, all of whom finished
behind him in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   But Baker's popularity was not only the result of the lyric
sweetness of his trumpet playing and the depth of feeling he
conveyed. His image on album covers was the quintessence of "cool."
He looked like an androgynous puer aeternus, the eternal youth who
belonged on a Keatsian Grecian urn. Baker was perhaps the first jazz
musician who was conscious of his image, so much so that he seldom
opened his mouth to reveal the missing front tooth knocked out when
he was a child.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin says that beneath that cool exterior, however, was an
insecure man. Because playing jazz came so easily, perhaps he did not
value his talent or think he deserved the acclaim. He admitted to an
Italian magazine that playing in public terrified him and only drugs
made him feel in control. "The public stops being an enemy, a hostile
bunch of adversaries ready to strike me down with their whistles. I
don't have anyone in front of me anymore. I am alone with my trumpet
and my music."</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps there is no deeper reason for Baker's almost lifelong
drug addiction than what he wrote in his brief memoir, "As Though I
Had Wings." After thanking the person who introduced him to
marijuana, he added, "I enjoyed heroin very much." Heroin use was an
integral part of the world of jazz, bebop and cool. But although many
musicians, such as Davis and John Coltrane, struggled to free
themselves from the drug, Baker was among those musicians for whom
playing jazz was merely the means to make enough money for the next
fix. In Europe, where Baker lived most of the time from 1955 until
his death in Amsterdam in 1988, many doctors were willing to keep him
supplied with narcotics. Mulligan explained Baker's popularity in
Europe as "a case of worshipping the self-destructive artist ....
It's a Christ-like image of self-immolation." By the end of his life,
he was injecting drugs into the arteries of his neck because a
lifetime of needles had destroyed the veins everywhere else on his
body.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin does not romanticize Baker's life and, although his portrait
of the trumpet player is balanced, one closes the book in agreement
with singer Lesley Mitchell, who told Gavin that Baker "had been a
junkie for so long that his soul was gone. The only time you could
perceive it was in his playing. There was such a duality there,
because he was a coldhearted, almost demonic figure. It was very hard
to understand where the beautiful music came from."</TE>
<TE>   The author has also compiled a CD, "Deep in a Dream: The Ultimate
Chet Baker Collection" to be released by Blue Note as a musical
companion to the book. Consisting of 19 tracks, it is worth it for
the opening track of Baker playing "My Funny Valentine," a song he
did much to popularize. However, fewer ballads, less of Baker's
breathy, toneless singing, and more up-tempo numbers would have made
for a better compilation.</TE>
<TE>   Baker died under mysterious circumstances. His body was found
lying in the street outside an Amsterdam hotel, his head bashed in.
Some believe he got high and slipped or jumped from his hotel room,
but the one window in the room was only raised 15 inches. Others
think he was killed by drug dealers to whom he owed money.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery of Baker's death is the subject of Bill Moody's
"Looking for Chet Baker," the fifth in his wonderful mystery series
featuring Evan Horne, a jazz pianist who gets embroiled in unraveling
mysteries, generally involving the lives and deaths of jazz
musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Horne is in Europe for a couple of gigs when his close friend, Ace
Buffington, a professor of English at the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas, seeks his help in researching a book on Baker, but Horne turns
him down.</TE>
<TE>   However, Horne's Amsterdam promoter has gotten him a room at the
same hotel in which Baker was staying at the time of his death, the
same hotel from which Buffington has mysteriously disappeared,
leaving behind his leather portfolio containing his research
materials. Concerned that something has happened to his friend, Horne
begins looking for him. To find Buffington, he must retrace Baker's
steps during the last days of his life and try to solve the mystery
of his death.</TE>
<TE>   A characteristic of the modern mystery novel is the intimate look
it provides to readers of a world they might never see. As a
professional jazz drummer, Moody knows jazz clubs and musicians, and
he is adept at evoking place, whether it is Los Angeles, San
Francisco or Amsterdam. He is wonderful at melding the facts of
musicians' lives with fiction, and here he vividly re-creates the sad
and painful last days of Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking for Chet Baker" is the best in the series. The writing is
fluid, the plotting is tight and there is a wealth of interesting
minor characters. The book also has a lovely introduction by Russ
Freeman, who played with Baker for many years, and closes with a
selected discography of Baker recordings; Gavin's biography contains
as complete a discography as one will find. Moody's and Gavin's books
skillfully re-create the jazz subculture and pay tribute to a man who
could not apply his extraordinary musical intelligence to the rest of
his life.</TE>

<DH>THE FEVER TRAIL: In Search of the Cure for Malaria, By Mark
Honigsbaum, Farrar, Straus and Giroux: 308 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE PANOSIAN DUNAVAN</AU>
<BD>Claire Panosian Dunavan is a professor of medicine and
infectious diseases at UCLA.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last month one of my medical students stopped me and dropped a
bombshell.</LD>
<LD>   "My uncle in India died," he began.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh?" I answered, expecting news of a heart attack or stroke in
middle age.</LD>
<TE>   "He had malaria," the student continued, looking dazed. "He died
12 hours after arriving at the hospital. I guess I never realized: If
he could get it, anyone could."</TE>
<TE>   In my mind's eye, I pictured the victim on his last day: His body
alternately hot or sopping with sweat, his blood rife with parasites,
his brain robbed of oxygen, his stricken body finally yielding to
malarial coma and circulatory arrest. In the tropics, such deaths are
common, totaling 1 million to 2 million every year.</TE>
<TE>   As a tropical medicine doctor, I'm often surprised how few
Westerners grasp malaria's devastation. That said, its global toll
remains staggering. In the last 20 years, it has killed nearly twice
as many people as AIDS. Every 30 seconds, it claims another African
child. Fifty-year-old corporate engineers are not immune, as my
student learned. Malarial mosquitoes can even stow away on
international flights--just ask recent unsuspecting victims near
airports in Geneva, Paris and Sao Paulo.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Honigsbaum's "The Fever Trail" chronicles the sweeping
back-story of malaria, which, centuries ago, afflicted rich and poor,
north and south. The disease also shaped history. In 1741, the fever
thwarted England's seizure of Spain's New World colonies. In 1809, it
trumped the redcoats again when Napoleon deliberately "weaponized" it
(by cutting dikes in Holland, he surrounded 40,000 British troops
with marshland, an ideal breeding ground for the Anopheles mosquito
that transmits malaria). Colonial ambitions in India and Africa often
hinged upon malaria. Closer to home, it killed or felled scores of
American fighting men in the Civil War, World War II and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Malaria's costs--human, economic, geopolitical--explain the dogged
hunt for antidotes which "The Fever Trail" follows over three
centuries. Early on, separating the therapeutic wheat from the chaff
wasn't easy. As Honigsbaum writes, "Quinine had to compete with such
well-known and time-tried remedies as viper's broth, crab's eyes and
spiders, which--imprisoned in rags and hung around the patient's
neck--were thought to act like therapeutic 'cocoons,' drawing the
'poison' of the fever into their own bodies."</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1800s, however, quinine's merits were unarguable.
Pre-DDT and synthetic pharmaceuticals, it was the world's single hope
for malaria. There was just one problem. Cinchona, the source of the
life-restoring alkaloid, grew deep in the Andean cloud forest. And so
began a high-stakes race among French, English and Dutch explorers to
find and steal the elusive tree with the cinnamon bark and the
crimson-lined leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Three men eventually led the field: Richard Spruce, a
hypochondriac moss collector; Charles Ledger, a cockney
fortune-hunter; and Clements Markham, a high-minded geographer. The
winner? Technically speaking it was Ledger, whose seedlings later
flourished in Dutch-owned plantations on Java. There, and in India,
the bark reaped healthy profits for First World investors by saving
lives of Third World residents lucky enough to afford it. (Ledger,
meanwhile, nearly died in poverty until, at age 79, the Dutch
parliament voted him a pension.)</TE>
<TE>   "The Fever Trail" reads like a 19th century thriller set in South
America, filled with high adventure and botanical wonder,
crisscrossing snowcapped mountains and jungle valleys, the Orinoco,
the Rio Negro and the Casiquiare. Honigsbaum, a former reporter for
the London Observer who retraced the dizzying footsteps of the
original cinchona hunters, deserves praise for meticulous fieldwork
and historiography. However, "The Fever Trail's" most compelling
theme is one that echoes ominously today: the tensions among public
health, governments and commerce. During the 19th century race for
quinine, a few outspoken humanitarians argued for universal access to
malaria treatment. Sadly, medical capitalism argued louder. Today,
our armamentarium greatly expanded, doctors, governments and
multinational business are still caught in the same quandary. Is
there light on the horizon? Perhaps. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's projected $8-billion global fund for HIV, malaria and
tuberculosis is one bright spot.</TE>
<TE>   But ethical dilemmas persist. In particular, Big Pharma, as the
international drug industry is known in health circles, still lacks
incentives to develop new treatments for tropical diseases whose
victims can scarcely pay for a day's food, much less expensive
medications. Witness the pipeline over the last several decades for
anti-malarials, a bare trickle in comparison to, say, blood pressure
pills for Western consumers. The one notable newcomer on the malaria
front is artemisinin, a plant-derived fever remedy first used more
than 2,000 years ago in China. It is spectacularly effective against
falciparum malaria, the variety that causes 95% of malaria deaths
worldwide. That's the good news.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news? Just like quinine years ago, artemisinin (also known
as qinghaosu) is now tangled in its own politics. First world drug
companies have been slow to invest in it, and key global
agencies--concerned about its cost and quality control--have been
slow to endorse artemisinin compounds in official treatment
cocktails. If unregulated use continues much longer, the ancient
Asian cure will almost certainly lose efficacy, given malaria's
predilection for resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Honigsbaum, I sensed, would have liked to end "The Fever Trail" on
a note of hope: the long-awaited malaria vaccine. But after ushering
readers on a journey from an experimental primate colony on an Amazon
island to the U.S. Navy Medical Research Lab in Bethesda, he cedes to
common wisdom: There's been progress in vaccine research, but a
successful jab is still years off.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some of my hope lies in the next generation. Take my
student. Before his uncle died, he was merely considering a career in
tropical medicine. Now that malaria's chill breath has touched one of
his own, he's sure.</TE>

<DH>THE DEMON AND THE ANGEL: Searching for the Source of
Artistic Inspiration, By Edward Hirsch Harcourt: 336 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>Adam Phillips is the author of numerous books,
including, most recently, "Houdini's Box: The Art of Escape" and
"Promises, Promises: Essays on Psychoanalysis and Literature."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the 19th century, the cult of artistic genius has been one of
our best ways of thinking about why we have come to value the arts,
as if the idea of the artist keeps alive for us certain cherished
values that we are unwilling or unable to give up. If scientists are
supposed to be the most realistic people around, artists are supposed
to be, in some way, the most honest. It is perhaps not surprising
that in a world in which people want to make sense and money, the
myth of the artist thrives. The so-called artist is the person who
makes money out of not making sense or is the person who has thought
of something even better to make. Their "inspiration" has shown them
something else to want.</LD>
<LD>   Stories about inspiration, such as the ones that Edward Hirsch
tells in "The Demon and the Angel"--and that, one way or another, are
the subject of every self-help book and religious guide--begin to
look like a counterculture, though what is being countered is not
always clear. It is assumed, obviously, that "artists" are not merely
the darlings of bankers and big business, that the arts are the
enemies of cliche, that they freshen our perception and that the
artist or the appreciator of the arts inside us--rather like "our
inner child"--is the best thing about us.</LD>
<TE>   These impressions keep us out of trouble, and the trouble seems to
be that without the arts we will become too staid, too glumly
moralistic, too relentlessly sensible. The arts, in other words, are
rather like what we want sex to be: something so refreshing, so
transformational, that we forget about losing heart. The "inspired"
artist makes us love life or love hating life, which comes to the
same thing.</TE>
<TE>   So when Hirsch tells us, about a third of the way through this
enthusiastic book, that it "essays praise for artistic inspiration,
for the dark dictations and struggles that get embodied in works of
art. It is a hymn to the irrational triumphs of art," no right-minded
person would take issue with him. But this is partly because it is
not obvious what one could take issue with, apart, perhaps, from his
claims of religion (why is it a hymn?) and triumphalism. But just as
using the word "passionate" a lot doesn't make you a passionate
person, using the words "dark" and "irrational" a lot, as Hirsch
does, doesn't make you a hieratic person.</TE>
<TE>   The virtues of this book--ample and fascinating quotations from,
among others, Federico Garcia Lorca, Rainer Maria Rilke, William
Butler Yeats, Mark Rothko; a sincerity of tone; and an aspiration to
inspire--are marred at every turn by a diminishing insistence. And
what is being insisted upon is something akin to an ambitious
exclamation, in which Hirsch's rather arch wonder seems to be doing
the work of the imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "The Demon and the Angel" is humorless because it so determinedly
refuses to argue with itself. Even though "risk" and "danger" are its
key words, it is insufficiently mindful of just what is at stake in
the (ancient) ardor for mystery. "It's stunning whenever a work of
art braves the risk and welcomes the dangers, when it gives itself
over to another power." Hirsch seems to believe that if you admire
something enough, you will become the thing you admire.</TE>
<TE>   It is one thing to regret (and defy) the abstract intellectualism
of academic artspeak or to want to write, as Hirsch impressively
does, a more open, accessible, democratic account of why certain art
matters. But it is quite another to make writing about the arts sound
like a form of quasi-religious patriotism. Hirsch is not quite
awarding medals for courage and irrationality in this book, but he is
doing the next best thing. He is writing, in "The Demon and the
Angel," a Gothic melodrama--sub Harold Bloom--of the artist as
exhilarating extremist: "a shocking alternation between the horrific
and the transcendental" (as he writes of the German poet Georg Trakl)
is what he is so stunned by. The artist is the terrorist who is good
for us.</TE>
<TE>   People are driven by pleasure and suffering, by the pleasures of
suffering through political and economic necessity to what we tend to
call the extremes of experience. But what is not clear--and what
makes Hirsch's book so instructive--is why we (or rather, some of us)
are so drawn to these extremes, and why we use art as our preferred
safe distance from experiences we would never really want to have.</TE>
<TE>   "The ancient demons are never far from shore," he writes with
gleeful portentousness. "They dwell within the deeps. They move in
the ghostly mists. A highly rational art is especially haunting when
one feels the struggle in the thought, or even underneath the
thought; when one senses something dark welling up from below, from
the primordial mud; when one recognizes the powerful internal
pressure of a mind defending itself against itself."</TE>
<TE>   If this is reminiscent of A. Alvarez's "The Savage God" or R.D.
Laing's "The Divided Self," it is, by the same token, also a
glamorization of suffering. Being tormented is not an adventure, even
when something comes of it (like a great work of art). And the risk
of this picture of artistic "struggle," one that is so impressed by
risk and struggle, is that it makes certain kinds of suffering seem
like a privilege. The prestige of pain is promoted, not its
incredible ordinariness. The difficulties of living should be given
their appropriate grandeur, but ancient demons, things primordial and
dark welling up, are too vague to do the trick. One can be taken by
the mystery of life without adding to the available obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   If "searching for the source of artistic inspiration," the
subtitle of Hirsch's book, is worth doing, it must be because
something good will happen to us when and if we find it. But Lorca's
notion of duende (an imp or demon of inspiration) and Rilke's
fictional angel are not exactly sources we can go in search of. As
they are, by definition, beyond our control, it would be truer,
though more disarming, to say that they go in search of us.</TE>
<TE>   The duende, Hirsch says, "is ancient, reckless and free"; it is
"savage and occult, ruthless in its alchemical pursuit of
expressiveness in art." Like the angel who comes (unlike the duende)
from what Hirsch calls "above," rather than below, it is "a
mysterious power which everyone senses and no philosopher explains."
The more familiar figure of "the daimon ... the artistic night mind
[is] a distant ancestor of Lorca's duende and Rilke's angel." It is
the higher and lower powers that Hirsch invokes, that let "the
secret, occult self dangerously loose into the world." And he calls
this experience "beyonding."</TE>
<TE>   But this post-romantic keenness to hand oneself over, to turn
oneself in to powers and forces beyond oneself, too easily sounds
like an impatient disgust for, or disappointment with, the
recognizably human. Religious longings for a super-power become a
nostalgic wish to be able to act out of character, to be possessed,
rather than to make a few unusual choices (there is no cure for
eccentricity). We can all feel tired of being ourselves, of being so
relentlessly the people we happen to be. But what Hirsch is promoting
with his "secret occult self" too often sounds like a refuge from
political engagement.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of people who need us to believe that it is better
to be inspired than to vote, that a religious sensibility, properly
cultivated, can console us for our political failures. Hirsch's
desire for "art stranger than rational logic, deeper than will"--his
having, as he says, "fallen in love with a poetry of oracles and
prophecies"--does not necessarily open up democratic vistas.
Democrats are not magicians.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of hoping against hope that art can and should do the work
of religion for us, or that art can be a refuge from rather more
brutal economic and political realities, the challenge now is to work
out what the big deal is about art. The poems of the earth, as
Wallace Stevens said, have not yet been written. Demons and angels
are just not earthy enough.</TE>
<TE>   There is a moment in this book--the best moment in this most
topical book--when Hirsch begins to have his doubts. When his always
gentle language of certainty falters: "It seems certain that we will
always need these strange imaginary beings, creatures of light,
winged manifestations of divinity. They are fundamentals of the human
imagination. But we need to protect them from superficial callings."</TE>
<TE>   Religiose to the unbitter end, "The Demon and the Angel" is too
short on our more mortal longings. Bertolt Brecht and William James
are better company than Lorca's duende and Rilke's angel.</TE>

<DH>SMALL PIECES LOOSELY JOINED: (A Unified Theory of the Web),
By David Weinberger, Perseus: 256 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of us simply weren't ready to digest the first round of books
explaining what the World Wide Web was and how it would change our
lives. We were too busy learning how to use e-mail to read manifestos
such as Nicholas Negroponte's "Being Digital" (1995), Raymond
Kurzweil's "The Age of Spiritual Machines" (1999) or Michael Heim's
"Virtual Realism" (1997), much less the Journal of the Hyperlinked
Organization. I speak loosely for those whom the revolution swept
over but who now find themselves comfortable enough with the
mechanics to sit back and philosophize about the physical and social
effects of the Internet. In "Small Pieces Loosely Joined," David
Weinberger guides us gracefully through the effects and history of
that revolution, just in time to ready us for the next one. "The Web
will have its deepest effect as an idea," not as the tool it has
become for most of us, Weinberger concludes. "Ideas don't explode;
they subvert."</LD>
<TE>   "Suppose--just suppose--that the Web is a new world that we're
just beginning to inhabit," he writes. "We're like the early European
settlers in the United States, living on the edge of the forest." He
begins gently with suppositions like this, raising issues, one by
one, picking up speed, drawing us further and further from concepts
we are comfortable with, until, midway through "Small Pieces," we
look down to find our understanding of the Internet--as a tool--far
beneath our feet. It can actually make you dizzy to consider the
changes that have already occurred in the ways in which we express
ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   These changes raise questions of morality and judgment over what
is good art-bad art. No one wants to sound like Jesse Helms, but
these are important questions that one should think about.
Weinberger's answer to the good art-bad art question is that there is
a trade-off involved. We'll have to put up with "awful information,"
"but in return we'll get a vibrant new world, accessible to
everyone.... The design assumption of the Internet was that it's an
imperfect world." With so much information available, certainty
becomes less, not more possible, rendering strong opinions about good
and bad less supportable. The Web is not slick; it is not about the
perfection of the advertising Hallmark-card world.</TE>
<TE>   Is the Web making us more or less social? Weinberger believes
wholeheartedly that it provides more possibilities for meaningful,
person-to-person connection as well as for group conversation without
the impediments of gender, color or class distinctions that are found
in real life. He seems to think that role-playing on the Web is
harmless and that the public focuses way too much on the anomalies,
the exceptions who use the Web for dangerous or perverse purposes.
"So many things don't make sense on the Web that we're suffering from
anomaly fatigue.... The real problem we face with the Web is not
understanding the anomalies but facing how deeply weird the ordinary
is."</TE>
<TE>   The Web has changed our perception of space because it puts
"everything we need within equally distanceless reach," eliminating,
for example, the way marketing and advertising gets between us and
the information or products we need. The desires of the consumer
trump corporate greed. "The politics of the Web," he writes, "by its
very nature, is that of public rights and public ownership."</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for time. "You are in control of your time on the
Web." That hasn't been true for as long as man has inhabited the
planet. "Web time is threaded."  And here is where the idea of small
pieces loosely joined comes in. "Web threads run in two directions.
Some, like the ones in chat rooms and e-mail, bind messages together
across a stretch of time. Others--hyperlinks--stitch together Web
places."</TE>
<TE>   Why has our mental reality always been so different from our
bodily reality? The Web joins the two in revolutionary ways. By
eliminating issues of time and space, we interact more responsively
to our world. We may be less able to control, even manage, that
world, but it is closer to real or natural experience than the old
world. "The Web is profoundly unmanaged, and that is crucial to its
success. It takes traditional command and control structures and
busts them up into many small pieces that loosely join themselves."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Web may help us cut through the use of morality
and values to control behavior; the monarchy of authority over
creativity; the exploitation of the world rather than a responsive
interdependent harmony within it. For the brief and shining hours
that I held this book in my hands, I believed that all this was
possible. I saw the Emerald City shimmering in the distance.</TE>

<LD>LAST YEAR'S JESUS</LD>
<LD>   By Ellen Slezak</LD>
<LD>   Theia/Hyperion: 256 pp., $22.95</LD>
<TE>   "Detroit had become a city you leave." So writes Ellen Slezak in
this impressive collection of stories whose common antihero is
Detroit itself, with its endless grid of charmless suburbs and its
hollowed-out center of crumbling apartment blocks. Staying and
leaving are central preoccupations for Slezak's Detroit folk, who are
mostly Polish and tend to punch the clock at Chrysler Forge and Axle
or at GM's Hamtramck Assembly Plant. In "Settled," Slezak shows that
the suburban exodus doesn't apply merely to the living but to the
deceased, too, when the body of a little girl is disinterred from a
Detroit cemetery and relocated to spiffier digs outside the city.
"Here in Car City" tells of a quixotic woman who opens a Euro-style
pensione on a bombed-out street downtown, and then witnesses the
improbable comings and goings of her lodgers. And in "Tomato Watch,"
a 96-year-old Polish grandfather ends up wandering down one of the
city's teeming highways, brandishing tomatoes he has grown in the
front yard. Slezak closes her story cycle--whose episodes don't
overlap but whose strong sense of place suggests a Motor City version
of "Dubliners"--with "Head, Heart, Legs or Arms," a short novella
that manages to seamlessly connect the 1967 riots, the Tigers' quest
for the pennant, a serial killer on the loose at U. of M. and a young
girl dying of cancer. It's an amazing meditation on a long-ago
troubled summer, on growing up in weird times, and, like all of "Last
Year's Jesus" (whose title refers to an actor in a Passion Play), on
an iconic American metropolis in deep distress.</TE>

<TE>   THINK OF ENGLAND</TE>
<TE>   By Alice Elliott Dark</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 272 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Alice Elliott Dark is the author of two acclaimed story
collections, and her debut novel has the same finely observed, hushed
ambience that makes her stories so seductive. "Think of England"
unfolds in three distinct sections, as if each were a short story
that outgrew the confines of the genre. And yet there's nothing
artificial about calling this remarkable triptych--which zeroes in on
the years 1964, 1979 and 2000--a novel: The story of Jane MacLeod
unfolds beautifully across "Think of England's" three panels, each
one a perfect evocation of its time and place.</TE>
<TE>   The book opens on a Sunday evening in February 1964, when the
Beatles made their first appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show." It's a
resonant cultural marker, but for 9-year-old Jane, living outside
Philadelphia and in love with George Harrison, it marks the death of
her father, who dies in a road accident later that night. When we
catch up with Jane in 1979, she flees to London, determined to shed
the stultifying suburbs and her bitter mom. Here, she enjoys the
pleasures of exile, befriending the fabulous Colette and her fiance,
Nigel, an aristocratic, Clash-era aristocrat. In the end, we find
Jane in New York, now the mother of a daughter whose father was an
anonymous sperm donor, attending a birthday bash for her ever-distant
mother. As it delicately probes the often inconvenient ties that bind
families and friends, "Think of England" uncovers a world of
loneliness and missed connections: a London love affair prematurely
ended, Harrison whizzing by in his Jaguar, a mother whose love pushes
away her children and a father forever lost to tragedy.</TE>

<TE>   GIRLS' POKER NIGHT</TE>
<TE>   By Jill A. Davis</TE>
<TE>   Random House: 232 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   To the burgeoning genre that straddles "Bridget Jones's Diary" and
"Sex in the City" comes "Girls' Poker Night," the amiable tale of a
capable young woman named Ruby Capote who comes to New York to write
a "single girl on the edge, ledge, verge" column for a tabloid
newspaper. Jill A. Davis has written for "The Late Show With David
Letterman," and the way she has Ruby describe her column would
suggest that we're in for a riotous sendup of all of those
cookie-cutter "laugh-out-loud" Bridget clones. Unfortunately, as
funny as Davis can be and as sympathetic as any single person younger
than 40 in New York is, "Girls' Poker Night" never takes a gamble,
choosing instead to tell the familiar story of a woman working in
publishing and falling in love with her somewhat complicated boss.
Perhaps the problem is that we never really see how Ruby's
travails--aforesaid boss, ex-boyfriend who inexplicably hoarded
plastic bread ties, creepy guy who wants to write on her with Magic
Markers--connect to her writerly pursuits; we don't actually see one
of Ruby's columns until the end, and by then it's too little too
late. As Ruby's boss quite openly points out, "I just thought if you
wrote about something more personal, but in this style it would be,
you know, it would be great." "Girls' Poker Night," alas, never
raises the ante.</TE>

<HD>The Romance of American Communism</HD>
<DH>RADICAL HOLLYWOOD: The Untold Story Behind America's
Favorite Movies, By Paul Buhle and Dave Wagner, The New Press: 460
pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SCHICKEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel is a contributing writer to Book
Review. His latest television documentary, a profile of director
Samuel Fuller, premieres on Turner Classic Movies in July.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1955 Murray Kempton published "Part of Our Time," a study of the
1930s radical left. In it, he contrasted the human "ruins" of that
movement--those who embraced Stalinism, ultimately rendering
themselves historically irrelevant and politically impotent--with its
"monuments": those who escaped entanglement with Soviet-controlled
ideology and, as a result, contributed to the incomplete victories
that have made the United States what it is today: a modern liberal
democracy with still a long road to travel.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, almost half a century and millions of politically
charged words later, Kempton's book remains one of the few worthwhile
studies of the old American left: graceful, ironic, touched equally
with affection and rueful contempt. It contains, among other
felicities, the best short summary of Hollywood's communists, those
men and women whose lives and careers would be derailed (some of them
only temporarily) by the Hollywood hearings of the House Committee on
Un-American Activities and the studio blacklist they engendered. In
his chapter on the Hollywood Reds, he stated a position that has,
until now, been inarguable: That the communist left--mostly
screenwriters--did not appreciably or subversively affect the content
of American films during the popular front decade (from the mid-'30s
to the mid-'40s).</LD>
<TE>   It is the central perversity of "Radical Hollywood," an earnest,
highly selective and very bad history of the old left's show biz
branch, to challenge this notion. No less than HUAC, Paul Buhle and
Dave Wagner see, albeit happily, Reds under all the beds who were far
more influential than they or we ever imagined. One can only guess at
the glee with which this book would have been greeted by HUAC's
investigators had it been published, say, in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   They could have learned, to their consternation, that some Gene
Autry, Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy westerns were written by
radicals and carried subversive messages about the rapaciousness of
the big ranchers and mining interests of the West. They would also
have discovered that even Abbott and Costello pictures were not
immune to odd bits of slipped-in social consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   I think we can accept that cheerfully enough, especially if we
remember that land- and water-rights westerns--whether they were
written by radicals or not--have ever found convenient villains in
the owners of significant prairie real estate and if we concede that
comedies, whether low (such as Abbott and Costello's) or high (such
as "The Awful Truth"), have always depended on rich ninnies to serve
as the butts of their jokes; it does not require a communist to
appreciate their usefulness in that regard. Unsurprisingly, few
romantic comedies, nearly all of which featured the rich and fatuous
getting either wisdom or comeuppance, were written by leftist
hard-liners. Sophisticated humor, it would seem, never comes easily
to dour ideologues.</TE>
<TE>   Buhle and Wagner almost ignore comedy of this kind--even,
unaccountably, the divine "Bringing Up Baby," which was written by
one of their heroes, the non-communist leftist Dudley Nichols--though
the genre carried some of the sharpest social criticism of the era.
But that's typical of their ideologically blinkered approach to every
genre from film noir to musical. Let their treatment of the social
issues movies of the '30s typify their method. If a still-great
gangster picture such as "The Public Enemy" was co-written by the
communist John Bright, it is fulsomely treated. If, though, that most
savage of feminist films, "Baby Face," was created by non-communists,
it doesn't rate a mention. The same goes for "Black Legion," the
best--maybe the only--film about nativist racism ever made. Or for
"Employees' Entrance" or "Skyscraper Souls" (female exploitation in
the workplace) or "Heroes for Sale" (a powerful portrayal of a war
hero's degradation).</TE>
<TE>   Even "Scarface," surely as potent a gangster drama as "The Public
Enemy," goes unnoticed because it, too, lacks leftist creative
credentials, as does "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang," easily the
most gripping of the era's many prison dramas. Frank Capra's most
socially conscientious movies ("Forbidden," "American Madness," "The
Miracle Woman," even his greatest success, "It Happened One Night,"
and that most riveting of his failures, "Meet John Doe") rate
scarcely a mention. It is only when his screenwriter is the communist
Sidney Buchman that the authors pause to parse, ineptly, "Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington."</TE>
<TE>   What's going on here? It would be easy to dismiss Buhle and Wagner
as slob historians, given the huge number of howling errors they
commit--misstated plot summaries, misattributed credits, vulgarly
stated political history--but they're not really historians at all;
they're mythologists, overstating the importance of the communists
and their allies in film history and underplaying the significance of
those less formally committed to ideology.</TE>
<TE>   It works like this: They sweep into their account every Hollywood
figure who, briefly or lengthily, was (to borrow some of their
favorite phrases) "a friend of the left," or "left-leaning" or an
"anti-fascist favorite." (People like the great cameraman Gregg
Toland are lumbered by such catch phrases, though it is impossible to
imagine how the way he lighted a set might have been conditioned by
his political views.) Concurrently, they are determined to dismiss
those who did not embrace, in Vivian Gornick's phrase, "the romance
of American Communism."</TE>
<TE>   The authors are beholden to the fantasy, much favored by the Old
Left and uncritically accepted by their New Left apologists, that in
Depression-era America, the only way to effect meaningful social
change was to embrace communism. This means they have to impute mass
status and influence to the party, both in and out of the movies. But
this is nonsense. To begin with, almost every socially ameliorative
or transformative action in New Deal America arose out of the
yearning hearts of liberal Democrats, not from the harder souls of
revolutionists. In this period, Communists never polled more than
about 100,000 votes in a national election and, more to our present
point, in Hollywood they had at most about 200 members (not all of
them simultaneously enrolled). It is possible that at the height of
Popular Front influence they could count on 1,000 "left-leaning"
supporters in the industry, but they, obviously, had varying degrees
of passion for the cause. The Purge Trials, the Hitler-Stalin Pact,
the Soviet invasion of Finland did take their tolls.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't matter to Buhle and Wagner. Everyone who ever gave
five bucks to help buy an ambulance for the Spanish Loyalists is a
creative hero to them; everyone else is a nonperson. This does
occasion their book's only grace notes: a surprising lack of rancor
about defected communists who later "named names" to the House
committee. It is more important to the authors to count future
apostates among the true believers than it is to chastise them for
subsequent betrayals.</TE>
<TE>   But it is their exclusionary passion, rather than their
inclusionary one, that renders their book useless. It stems from
their New Left premise that, absent the guidance of a revolutionary
cadre that could use the mass media as a bullhorn, American society
could not get itself roiling and boiling with the fervor it
exhibited, and its films reflected, in the 1930s. They seriously
believe that film in the Popular Front period was the primary "means
of communication between social movements and ordinary Americans,"
that "the most crucial as well as most expansive experiments were
realized via this relation," that, indeed, Popular Front movies
constituted "an alternative to anti-populist modernism."</TE>
<TE>   But American movies have always been a prime example of socially
careless capitalism. Frenziedly, irrationally, they will or will not
use ideology in pursuit of popular favor. The lugubrious theorizing
of communism's corrupt intellectuals (Buhle and Wagner devote a
particularly dismal chapter to it) is of no consequence to those who
control the means of production. The very idea that communist
luminaries like John Howard Lawson or Albert Maltz would have been
capable of writing "expansive experiments" is ludicrous. They
achieved their apotheosis in World War II, writing emotionally empty
tributes to its "little guy" heroes and were engaged in finding new
forms of hackery when HUAC silenced them.</TE>
<TE>   Film noir was a place the communists tried to go but naturally the
authors misstate the genre's history in their maddening way. The
movies that really influenced film history were made by the likes of
Alfred Hitchcock, Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks and Billy Wilder, who
drew their energy not from ideological cant but from the variously
delightful and menacing forms American nuttiness takes. The communist
left produced almost nothing but gasbags, now thoroughly deflated. In
a way, "Radical Hollywood" is their perfect tribute; a huge lie built
on hundreds of smaller ones, a wet travesty of scholarly and critical
standards.</TE>

<DH>Political comedian Will Durst chronicles life on the road
as he tries to amuse a post-Sept. 11 nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILL DURST</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My name is Will Durst and I'm a political comedian. Which means that
when nothing's going on, I'm screwed. But not now.</LD>
<LD>   Son of a Milwaukee machinist, I've had more than 100 jobs but
never dreamed of doing anything else. Growing up in the shadow of the
ghosts of Lenny and Mort and Lord Buckley and the Vietnam War back
when you could tell the good guys from the bad guys just from their
haircuts, I considered social satire a higher calling. Like the
priesthood; only the services are held in bars and the parishioners
got to smoke.</LD>
<LD>   Comedy clubs are the new people's theaters. If Bertolt Brecht were
alive today, I'm convinced he'd be a stand-up comic--although a
career as a political comedian is not the greased chute to the big
time one might think merely by looking at Bill Maher. Networks would
rather be caught naked at a Junkie Hookers for Satan convention than
be connected to anything controversial or time-dated. Leno and
Letterman focus on the topical every night with material they've seen
four times tops, so the last thing they need is some blue-collar
schmuck parroting their premises with a practiced choreography.
They're Macy's and Nordstrom. I'm a boutique off an alley in SoHo.
All my material is hand-sewn.</LD>
<TE>   But I work. About 30 weeks at clubs and 40 corporate gigs a year
(where the real comedy money is). I also write some, contribute
commentaries to public radio and host a show on PBS called
"Livelyhood," eking out a decent living making people laugh out loud
on purpose against their will. I've clawed my way to the middle.
There are worse ways to live.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, one is subject to the swells and eddies of the real
world, more so than your average bear. Bill Clinton was actually bad
for political comedy because of how the spotlight drifted below the
belt. Every two-bit hack in America pulled a Rumpelstiltskin,
spinning sex jokes into presidential sex jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Sept. 11. Comedy in wartime--a sticky proposition.
It took a wee bit of accommodation by both the audience and myself to
get it just right. Here's a partial diary.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 8, Acme Comedy Club, Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Early Sunday morning. The only reminders of Saturday's two
sold-out shows are a table littered with overflowing ashtrays and a
sad gaggle of beer bottles belonging to a small group of serious
thinkers: me, Louis Lee, the club owner, and Dan Schlissel, an
independent producer who's taped my seven performances this week in
hopes of releasing a CD. I'm ranting about the perishability of my
material, a major reason my previous attempts at recording were never
released. My complaints shift to the dearth of material on Dubyah.
The major arrow in my slim quiver is "George W reminds me of a
stripper with hairy legs. Got some real smooth moves but even from
way back at the bar you can tell something is horribly awry." Louis
consoles me: "Don't worry, it's been quiet too long. Something's
going to happen. You watch."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 10, Home, San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Packing. Positively giddy about tomorrow's trip to New Orleans
Comedy Festival. Total cruise gig--not in terms of water, but smooth
and low maintenance. My lovely wife, Debi Ann, much funnier than I,
is scheduled to serve as host of Wednesday's Improvisation Jam. I'm
headlining a show Saturday, and they're putting us up for a week in
the French Quarter and paying us. Already have reservations at three
restaurants including a pilgrimage to one where we order the same
thing every time. No idea what it is. A stick of butter with herbs
nearby is my guess. Aah, New Orleans, home of the neutron bomb of
foods. Destroys your internal organs, but it leaves your will to
drink intact. Been looking forward to this for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11, Home, San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Tube glued.</TE>
<TE>   Awaiting a ride to the airport, we turn on the television and
everything we know is wrong. A day of stunned silences broken by
incredulous phone calls, humans seeking normalcy through contact.
Late in the night, alone watching MSNBC, I chuckle at a crawl reading
"New York City reports no unusual looting." Apparently just the
normal Tuesday-night load.</TE>
<TE>   There is humor in the specter of the worst disaster in our
nation's history. All I have to do is sweep away the debris of shock
to find it.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 12, Home, San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Furiously writing.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the material will not touch upon death or destruction,
but as President Bush said, "We all have our job to do," and mine is
to root out items emanating even the faintest ironic aroma. Right
now, the jokes will be very red, white and bluish, and will deal with
the responses to the catastrophe rather than the events themselves.
All Bush bashing put on hold.</TE>
<TE>   * The scariest part of the Pentagon bombing is leaving the
Pentagon in control of estimating their own damage repairs.</TE>
<TE>   * While Tony Blair and George W. were touring ground zero, Bill
Clinton was squiring Mrs. Blair around Manhattan. Oh terrific, we
don't have enough to worry about, now we're going to war with
England.</TE>
<TE>   * Jerry Falwell blamed gays, feminists and the ACLU for making God
turn his back on America. Of course, this is the same guy who was
convinced a purple Teletubby was a homosexual recruiter. I think he
might be a little over-focused.</TE>
<TE>   It's a start.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 13, Cobb's Comedy Club, San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Pacing.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Black, sage curmudgeon on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show,"
scheduled to work this weekend, is stuck in New York till Saturday.
Club owner Tom Sawyer calls around 2 p.m. asking if I can fill in
tonight and tomorrow. Hell, yeah! Stare at notes wondering if there's
any real or imaginary jokes hidden within. At club, first two guys
pretty much ignore the situation. Amazingly, the audience doesn't
seem to care. I fear the worst. Maybe they don't want to hear about
it. Maybe they came to a comedy club to escape reality not relive it.
Name is announced and it's too late to worry. Open with, "Not only
are the Taliban bloodthirsty and vicious, they're stupid. I'm
serious, if they wanted to destroy America's financial stability, all
they had to do was take out the IRS building and the country's entire
response would have been ... 'Oh ... darn. Those bad guys. They did a
mean thing. Better not try that again.'"</TE>
<TE>   Crowd goes nuts. It's like a pep rally for 40 minutes. It's a
cathartic release for both of us. Suddenly I'm a therapist. My mom

<TE>   Absent.</TE>
<TE>   A corporate gig (read: high-paying private gig) cancels. Group
officials are worried a political comedian might be too stressful
during these times and decides to go with "a happier act." They hire
a local banjo-playing ventriloquist. They're right. I could never be
that happy. Would love to just see the guy (does he play the banjo
and the dummy sings, or vice versa or both?), but they agree to cover
the airfare I've already shelled out and I stay home.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 18, Crystal City, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Keynote speaking.</TE>
<TE>   We start bombing Afghanistan. After appearing on "This Week With
David Brinkley" without David Brinkley, Vice President Dick Cheney is
frog-marched to a secure bunker in the southeast corner of Wyoming.
Meanwhile Bush is giving a speech in front of a window. With traffic
behind him. Why don't they just tie him to a gate as bait? You know
during the whole anthrax thing they had Bush opening Cheney's mail.
You know they did. You can't make stuff up like this. Material works
in front of this conference of government procurers. Everywhere
except Midwest. Still too tough on president.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 22, Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Turkeying.</TE>
<TE>   Nice to know some things never change. A sleazy weasel producer in
my hometown rips me off for a couple grand. Six months later, he has
yet to return my calls. This is the dark side of not having an agent
or a manager: I eat the loss. Trying to think of the bright side of
not having an agent or a manager ... oh yeah: 25% more to me. The
truth is, none of the agencies is interested in a middle-aged
political comic. In my mid-40s I'm already 21/2 decades too ancient
for a development deal.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, when I was young, we kids were shut out because they wanted
experience and maturity. Ain't life odd?</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 26, Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Touring.</TE>
<TE>   Annual year-end review sells out four of seven shows in theaters
with four other comics. Obviously, theaters are the way to reach my
target demographic. Audiences for political material exist, but
they've grayed and cocooned. No longer venturing into that nasty
nether world of evil (three syllables like Bush) nightclubs. They're
theater people now, dahling. Start rethinking possibility of the
one-man show idea. The Holy Grail of the aging comic. The problem is,
a one-man show has to be set in stone, and political comedy is
continually mutating. Oh good, another Catch-22.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 5, Improv, West Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Dying.</TE>
<TE>   Killed by opening act. One of the new breed of uber-high-energy
kids with the attention span of high-speed lint. Slaps his face,
screams, spits, sweats, schleps around on imaginary horsies bellowing
at the crowd. Closes his set by pouring an entire beer over his head.
Extremely funny. Achingly funny. But now the stage is an irony-free
zone. I have as much chance of following him as a wounded bunny has
of surviving a starving cougar cage at an all-night disco under one
of the bass amps. Like putting an acoustic act on after Metallica.
Audience members are young too. They stare at me like I'm teaching
particle physics to a gerbil. "Why is this bitter old man lecturing
me?" Club owner says its the worst booking he's ever made. Then he
laughs. So do I. Only different-like. But they drink. And they drink.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the real bottom line in a nightclub. So I might get
booked back.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 10, Improv, Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   Turning a corner.</TE>
<TE>   A funny thing is happening. The kids are getting it. They're
laughing at shared references. The "anti-Taliban" stuff and the
"Cheney is really in charge" stuff is working. Maybe they never
connected to politics before.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a baby boomer. My parents laid it on with a trowel right from
the start: "I grew up during a depression, then a World War. I'll
never forget where I was when Pearl Harbor was bombed." We boomers
tried the same thing: "I grew up during the Vietnam War, and we lost
Bobby and Martin and Malcolm. I'll never forget where I was when
Kennedy was shot." And the kids had nothing: "I grew up during CNN
and MTV, and I'll never forget where I was when Michael Jackson's
hair caught on fire. Those pitiful screams, 'Tito, Tito' and Tito
never came." The Crisis Envy has been bridged. Gens X and Y and maybe
even Z have officially been grounded. Hell, I got five more years on
the road, minimum.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 24, Improv, Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Grinning.</TE>
<TE>   While watching an NFL playoff game, Bush chokes on pretzel,
meaning: He's fair game again. "I mean, c'mon, even Gerald Ford could
chew. I don't believe the pretzel bit at all. His staff would never
let him look ridiculous unless what really happened was even more
ridiculous or crazy. My theory is he was taunting his dad for how
much better his war was going and Bar hit him in the head with an
empty gin bottle." D.C. crowds eat it up.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences full of sick, twisted, paranoid, cynical toads who read.
My kind of people.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 28, Fairmont Hotel, San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Killing.</TE>
<TE>   At a Barbara Boxer fund-raiser, I tell a joke and kick the punch a
second early, causing Bill Clinton to laugh so hard he spits water
out his nose. I give the former president a sinus douche. He later
explains to me why my Cheney joke is funny. This is so cool. Of
course I don't tell him when I worked at a George H.W. Bush benefit,
I did all Clinton and Gore stuff. He'd understand. It's all politics.
Think locally. Laugh globally.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 22, Stanford &amp; Sons Comedy Club, Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Baby-sitting. Second show Friday night. The weekly Waterloo of
every club in the country. They've worked all day, started drinking
at 5 and by the time the headliner gets on stage, the house should
furnish him with a torch, a chair and a whip. They don't want
political comedy. They want bright and loud, so I switch midstream
and do a lot of pot jokes.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not an artiste, I'm a craftsman. The only way I get hired back
is if the audience laughs. They do. They even like my close, when I
talk about how this is one resilient nation. Made it through two
terms of Bill and eight years of Reagan. We're more than a nation,
we're a notion. We're an idea. The American Dream. You never heard of
the Afghan Dream have you? Except by bearded hermetic recluses with a
fetish for uneducated women dressed as giant shuttlecocks.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttlecocks. I love that I get to say shuttlecocks on stage.</TE>
<TE>   April 23, Home, San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Resting.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to first pressing of new CD taped at Cobb's Comedy Club in
beginning of February. Almost entirely new set since Minneapolis
attempt a scant seven months ago. Never been this prolific before.
Feel guilty for making hay after the tragic events of 9/11. Then
again, it's a responsibility as well. Comedy is defiance. It's a
snort of contempt in the face of fear and anxiety. And it's the
laughter that allows hope to creep back on the inhale.</TE>

<HD>What Do You See, Moby?</HD>
<DH>To a pop industry seeking direction, the artist seems like
a visionary. But really he's a single-minded musician full of
insecurities, not answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As Richard Melville Hall stands in a health-food market aisle in his
rumpled sweatshirt and jeans, lunch hour shoppers have no idea this
diminutive fellow rivals Beck as the hip pop auteur of the day. He
looks like just another 36-year-old bald guy trying to choose between
barbecue seitan and tofu.</LD>
<LD>   Hall, better known to pop fans as Moby, puts a wheat-based seitan
sandwich in his red shopping basket, alongside a fruit drink and
energy bar, and heads to the checkout counter.</LD>
<LD>   It's not until a record company promotion man starts talking to
him about seeing his new video on MTV that anyone senses that in
their midst is a gifted artist whose work is helping open a door to
21st century pop. Studying the shaved head and thin frame, a shopper
whispers to his friend, "It's Michael Stipe."</LD>
<TE>   Moby may be anonymous in a crowd, but he has much of the pop world
enthralled. If Bono were looking for a running mate in his campaign
to save the world, Moby would be the one. The New Yorker is smart,
talented and opinionated, as quick to write letters to the editor to
express his views on social issues as he is to write essays in his
album booklets about everything from the virtues of a vegan diet to
the dangers of religious intolerance. There is also a warm, spiritual
component to his music that shares U2's uplifting faith in the
goodness of man.</TE>
<TE>   His music is a liberating merger of classic blues, gospel and rock
elements with the forward-thinking electronica world of samplers and
computers. It's music that seems to incorporate the best of decades
of pop emotion into tracks that are fresh and affecting.</TE>
<TE>   A specific track from "Play, his 1999 album demonstrates how Moby
works. "Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad" is an expression of longing
that is as gripping as any of the classic '60s and '70s soul hits,
such as Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman" or Al Green's
"Tired of Being Alone." When you think of those old songs, what
really stands out in your memory is the title phase and the deeply
emotional vocal. Moby combs through hundreds of blues and gospel and
pop recordings for a vocal moment that touches him, and then he tries
to create new music that places the vocal line in an original and
absorbing setting.</TE>
<TE>   MTV not only plays Moby's videos, but also has also given him his
own half-hour program, "Senor Moby's House of Music," in which he
plays his favorite videos. He'll be a guest on "Saturday Night Live"
next weekend, and he touches on so many pop culture buttons that he
has landed on the covers of both Spin and Wired. You've also seen him
in those celebrity Gap and Calvin Klein ads. Moby is so much on
everyone's mind that rap provocateur Eminem takes a swipe at him in
Eminem's new album, revenge for Moby's criticism of Eminem's X-rated
diatribes as irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying much of this fascination is the naive belief that Moby
is a visionary with the answers to many of the questions dogging a
complex pop world besieged by declining fan loyalty and an absence of
clear musical direction. "Moby epitomizes the post-millennial
downtown sensibility," says Vanity Fair's New York-based scenester
George Wayne. "If Warhol were still with us, he would have been
cozying up to Moby as his best new friend."</TE>
<TE>   One reason Moby is suspected of having special insight is an
innovative marketing campaign that turned his last album, "Play,"
into an international best-seller. Rather than turn to radio, which
had been cool to Moby's music in the past, he and his advisors
reached potential fans by putting his songs in dozens of movies and
commercials, from director Oliver Stone's "Any Given Sunday" to ads
for Nordstrom.</TE>
<TE>   While all this is impressive, it's an illusion to think that he or
anyone has figured out the secrets of hit-making. Too many recording
artists, from Puff Daddy and Marilyn Manson to Billy Corgan and Beck,
have been hailed as figures with their fingers on the pulse, only to
see their fan bases largely evaporate overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Moby, whose new album comes out this week, understands better than
most that nothing is a sure commercial bet anymore. That's why he is
trying to improve his chances of another hit with a five-month
promotional blitz that has involved some 750 radio, TV and press
interviews. Soon after "18" hits the stores Tuesday, he'll begin a
15-month concert tour to further promote the album.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than the all-knowing figure often portrayed by the media,
he has the same deeply rooted insecurities of most pop stars.
"Pathological low self-esteem" is a phrase he often employs.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I have to work 10 times harder than anyone else because I
felt so inadequate growing up," he says as he unwraps the seitan
sandwich in the back seat of an SUV that is taking him to the next
radio interview. "Feeling out of place is one of the things that
drove me to fall in love with music in the first place, which is true
of a lot of musicians, isn't it? There's not a lot of precedent for
well-adjusted, normal musicians going on to make great records.</TE>
<TE>   "When fans ask how to succeed as a musician, my answer is harsh. I
tell them not to do anything else. Most people aren't willing to do
that--drop out of college, forsake relationships, anything that
distracts you from your music.... I'm different."</TE>
<TE>   It's three hours before the health-food shopping trip, and Moby
has just arrived at the downtown studios of KFOG-FM, home of "world
class rock." The slogan and the photos on the wall--John Lennon, Mick
Jagger, Tom Petty, Chrissie Hynde--tip off the station's adult
demographics.</TE>
<TE>   The format is perfect for Moby because his music has a classic
feel that appeals to adventurous older listeners. You'll likely find
his photo on someone's wall at taste-conscious public radio stations
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the electronic elements in Moby's music, he's also
popular with younger listeners, which is why he stops frequently at
stations with "modern rock" or "alternative rock" formats, such as
KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, where he's a big favorite of morning hosts
Kevin and Bean.</TE>
<TE>   The KFOG lobby is still filled with the overnight chill as a
receptionist greets Moby, his manager and two representatives of V2
Records, the company that British tycoon Richard Branson started
after selling his Virgin label to Thorn EMI for nearly $1 billion in
1992. The entourage is ushered into a studio, where three DJs waste
little time in starting an interview that will be taped and played
throughout the week.</TE>
<TE>   The one constant in these radio visits: The DJs say how much they
love Moby's music, and he stresses how glad he is to be visiting the
station. At the end, he invariably tapes station ID messages.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Moby and you're listening to KFOG...."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he poses for photos, shakes hands with other station
employees and signs a few autographs before heading back to the SUV
for the ride across town to the next interview. Besides visiting
radio stations during the last four months, he has participated in
their promotional contests, cooking breakfast for some winners,
eating dinner with others and record shopping with still more.</TE>
<TE>   Moby, unusually soft-spoken and polite for a pop star, is gracious
throughout, but I wonder what he really thinks. In the hundreds of
hours I've spent with artists on the promotion trail, it's been rare
to find anyone who enjoys the process.</TE>
<TE>   Some, such as the late Kurt Cobain, find it demeaning and all but
refuse to participate. Other musicians simply find it tedious. The
road manager for a British punk band once delighted in telling me how
he used to pretend to be the group's lead singer in phone interviews,
relieving the band of the burden of answering the same questions over
and over. "It was easy," he joked. "All I had to do was have an
English accent and be rude."</TE>
<TE>   Eager young musicians often endure this type of exhausting
publicity grind, but it's rare that a best-seller approaches the task
with the devotion of Moby. But the only time Moby gives even a hint
of rolling his eyes is when someone at a station starts playing
around with his name. When Moby explains he got the nickname because
he's a descendant of Herman Melville, the author of "Moby-Dick," the
DJ asks if anyone ever called him Moby Dick?</TE>
<TE>   I later ask Moby the first time he heard that question.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 4."</TE>
<TE>   The second stop is at alt-rock outlet KLLC-FM, and it's fun for
Moby because he gets to play DJ for a half-hour. Between questions,
he plays some of his favorite singles, David Bowie's "Heroes" and
U2's "One."</TE>
<TE>   The choices are revealing. They are warm, uplifting, deeply
emotional works--the tone that Moby aimed for in much of "Play" and
even more of "18."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers seem more interested in individual singles than whole
albums these days, and Moby has mastered the art of making albums in
which every track feels like a potential hit single. In the process,
he underscores the compatibility of competing genres.</TE>
<TE>   Moby played in punk bands as a teen, but later became fascinated
with disco and electronica sounds. Although most of the pop world in
the '80s saw punk and electronica as incompatible, Moby thrilled to
the sonic pleasures of both.</TE>
<TE>   His ability to combine the various elements is what made "Play"
such a vital album, one that injected soul into the often anonymous
dance-music style. It's music that sometimes seems too open-hearted
and lovely for these cynical times.</TE>
<TE>   Over thousands of hours spent alone in his home recording studio,
Moby came to realize that the only thing important to him is the
final product. It doesn't matter if he sings the vocal or samples it
from an existing record. It doesn't matter if the song has extensive
lyrics or just keeps repeating a phrase. It doesn't matter if he
plays the instruments or crafts sounds through synthesizers. His only
allegiance is to the sound that finally comes out of the speakers.</TE>
<TE>   This flies in the face of many long-standing guidelines for
musical integrity and accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the history of pop music, any interesting genre is
predicated on breaking taboos," he says. He has finished his sandwich
and is sitting in the lobby at KCNL-FM in San Jose, waiting to be
interviewed by the DJ. "What's ironic is the people who break the
taboos usually go on to erect new ones. I've seen it with two of my
favorite musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Brian Eno, one of my musical heroes, was complaining recently
about the lack of real musicianship in popular music, and he's
someone who started out making noise on a Moog synthesizer. Keith
Richards yelled at me because he thought my sampling old blues
recordings [on 'Play'] was wrong. I kept my mouth shut, but my first
reaction was, here is one of those white kids from England covering
and ripping off old blues records in the '60s. How dare you criticize
me?"</TE>
<TE>   He breaks off the thought because he has to rush into the studio
for his third interview of the day.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, he does his duty. "This is Moby and you're listening
to ... "</TE>
<TE>   Because he spends so much time on the road, Moby travels light. On
this West Coast swing, he has just a backpack that holds books and
his laptop, which he uses to post a daily journal on his Web site.
He's got some T-shirts and jeans, which pretty much define his
fashion choices, in a duffel bag. Both bags fit conveniently in the
overhead bin on the flight from San Jose to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Moby also doesn't appear to need much in terms of material goods.
Despite the fortune he's made since "Play," which has sold more than
10 million copies around the world, he still lives in the same
relatively modest apartment in lower Manhattan , and his biggest
splurge since the album's success, he says, was a $10,000 Christmas
party he threw last year.</TE>
<TE>   His spartan lifestyle may be a reflection of his semi-hippie
upbringing or simply another sign of his insecurity.</TE>
<TE>   Moby's father was a Columbia University teaching assistant who was
so prone to depression that there is suspicion that his death in a
car accident when Moby was 2 was really suicide. Moby's mother, an
undergraduate at Columbia, then moved to wealthy Darien, Conn., where
her parents helped her find a place of her own.</TE>
<TE>   She worked at various secretarial jobs, often relying on food
stamps to supplement her income. It was a traumatic time, Moby says,
because he felt so out of step with the rest of the families in the
exclusive suburban town.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just that feeling of always knowing I was poor and my
friends were wealthy," says Moby, an only child. "It was being raised
by a single parent who smoked pot and painted and played music, while
my friends' parents were executives and housewives.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not complaining. I love the circumstances of my upbringing.
But at the time I hated them. I desperately wanted to have the normal
family with the father who made a lot of money and nice house and
nice clothes. I longed for normalcy."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many youngsters, he found comfort in music. He identified
with musicians and soon had a thirst to know more about them. A
subscriber to Rolling Stone magazine at 13, he found it reassuring
that many of the artists also came from difficult childhoods. "It
made me feel there was a place for me too," he says.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the University of Connecticut, where he studied
philosophy for a couple of years, Moby, who took piano and guitar
lessons as a child, began searching for that place. In 1989, he moved
to New York City, where he worked as a club DJ at night and recorded
his own music during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Taylor, Moby's co-manager for a decade, says the musician
has always been a hard worker.</TE>
<TE>   "He's basically the same person I met 11 years ago," says the
former rock journalist, sitting a few rows behind Moby on the plane.
"He was never into material comforts. When we started working with
him, he didn't have running water in his old apartment, but he was
happy because he was making music."</TE>
<TE>   Although Taylor and his partner, Marci Weber, always saw Moby as
someone who could reach a wider pop audience beyond the dance-music
world, it took years for them to prove the point.</TE>
<TE>   Moby made some acclaimed records, including the 1991 dance hit
"Go" and the 1994 album "Everything Is Wrong." But sales were meager,
and Moby started to think that a change of labels might help
jump-start his career. He worked out a release from Elektra Records
in 1997, but it took months to find any other label interest.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very debilitating time," Taylor says. "When we couldn't
get a record contract for 'Play,' I didn't want Moby to think it was
because there was something wrong with the music. I kept stressing
that record companies make their decision based on things other than
the music. The great thing about V2 was they understood it was going
to be a long haul. They weren't going to give up if radio didn't
respond to the record in two or three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Even after he got the record deal, Moby felt so beaten down by the
rejection that he was sure the album was going to be another
commercial failure. He walked around his neighborhood the night
before its release, thinking about going back to school to study
architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor and Weber, however, set about trying to place the "Play"
music in films and commercials, something they had done with some
success on earlier Moby recordings. To attract the attention of the
film community, Moby performed at the Sundance Film Festival in 1999.
The campaign resulted in songs from "Play" being licensed for films,
TV shows and commercials--from the film "The Beach" to the TV show
"The X-Files" to commercials for American Express and Adidas.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder that industry observers think Moby and his team are
marketing masters. Even though Moby now has radio on his side,
Taylor, however, knows there's no guarantee that "18" will come close
to "Play's" sales.</TE>
<TE>   "This business isn't a formula," he says. "It's like the lottery
each time out with a record. Moby isn't taking anything for granted.
He's only had one vacation in the last five years. He went to an
island for a week, but he's on the phone to me the second day saying
he needs to get back to work."</TE>
<TE>   When we arrive at Moby's Los Angeles hotel, Le Parc, I assume he's
going to want to take a few minutes to relax before we continue the
interview, but he pulls me along as he steps into the elevator. The
only thing Moby likes less than a thick steak is wasting time.</TE>
<TE>   The one time I see him irritated is the following day when there
is a mix-up in the schedule and he arrives for an interview in West
Los Angeles 90 minutes early.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if someone had tried to drive a dagger into his heart.</TE>
<TE>   "How does this happen?" he snaps.</TE>
<TE>   While the manager and record company rep try to move the interview
up, I feel obliged to help ease the tension. But we had already spent
hours talking and there really isn't anything left to ask about his
music.</TE>
<TE>   Finally I say, "What five movies would you recommend to someone?"</TE>
<TE>   We also go through his list of recommended albums, movies and
books.(See sidebar.)</TE>
<TE>   For a change of pace, I am about to ask this world traveler for a
list of his least favorite airports, but the record company rep
signals they are finally ready for Moby's interview. I make a point
of remembering the question--just in case of a future lull.</TE>
<TE>   Like other rewarding pop artists, Moby really makes music for
himself, and the important thing to know about his tastes is that he
loves beautiful vocals and sad soul ballads, the kind Al Green and
Teddy Pendergrass sang.</TE>
<TE>   In making "18," Moby listened to hundreds of records searching for
vocal lines--often just two or three words--that moved him. When he
found one, he listened to it over and over while playing different
accompanying chords on the piano to build a new musical setting for
it. Sometimes the process led to dead ends. He estimates he has
pieces of 3,000 recordings stored in his studio.</TE>
<TE>   When I ask him to walk me through the creation of a track on "18,"
he chooses "In My Heart," one of the songs in the gospel-driven style
of "Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad," one of the highlights from
"Play." The spirited solo on "In My Heart" is by a member of the
Shining Light Gospel Choir.</TE>
<TE>   "He's singing in C major," Moby says as he begins reconstructing
the recording. "If I play C major or G major or F major, it has a
very wholesome, calm, uplifting quality. I play something in A minor,
it becomes very sad. E minor would be even more disturbingly sad. D
minor, very mournful. It's just basic music theory and it's how I
start. I'll keep playing things until something feels right, then
I'll add some rudimentary drums, sometimes sampled, sometimes with a
drum machine, sometimes live. Then I'll add other instruments."</TE>
<TE>   Although the bulk of the tracks are done in this form, Moby
sometimes brings in vocalists to join him (Angie Stone and Sinead
O'Connor are among the guests on "18"), and he sometimes sings
himself, as on the new single "We Are All Made of Stars," a song with
an everyman optimism reminiscent of Bowie's "Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   In the energetic, character-rich "Extreme Ways," Moby demonstrates
his ability to work in a more conventional pop sense. He wrote the
lyric, a gripping account of fast-lane excesses. The song is expected
to be the second single from the album.</TE>
<TE>   The new album doesn't break ground the way "Play" did, so it may
not be as acclaimed ("Play" was named the best album of 1999 in the
Village Voice's poll of the nation's pop critics). But the album
extends the discoveries of "Play" in ways both pleasing and joyful.</TE>
<TE>   "I've softened as the years have gone on," Moby says when asked
about the gentle, reassuring tone of the new album. "I want people to
feel cared for. I wanted to reach out to people, even take care of
them a bit. There are some people for whom music can be inadvertent
background music. For others, music can be an integral part of their
life, and that's who I'm trying to reach because I'm one of those
people."</TE>
<TE>   It's a week later, and Moby has been to Dallas, Atlanta, New York
City and Toronto on his promotional trek. He's now in a towering
aircraft hangar in the high desert town of Victorville, Calif.,
waiting for the cameras to roll on the video that will be used to
promote "Extreme Ways." The video won't be released in the U.S. until
August, but these are the only three days he has free for filming.</TE>
<TE>   Moby is surrounded by five look-alikes who are stand-ins in the
performance video, which will show Moby playing all the instruments
(drums, bass, guitar and keyboards) as well as singing the song.
Wayne Isham, a veteran video director, came up with the concept as a
way of underscoring that Moby does play everything on the record.</TE>
<TE>   To keep Moby busy on the set, his U.S. and British publicists are
both on hand. He's scheduled to do an interview for V2's electronic
press kit and to be shadowed for a while by the British TV program
"The South Bank Show."</TE>
<TE>   After the video shoot, Moby will head to Europe for some TV
appearances and more interviews. Then he's due back in New York for
the opening tonight of TeaNY, the tea shop that he owns with former
girlfriend Kelly Tisdale, who has worked on social activist projects.</TE>
<TE>   Moby speaks vaguely about getting married and having kids someday,
but it doesn't seem very convincing. He's got a network of friends,
but everything seems secondary to his work. By most standards, he
pursues his art and career with almost monastic devotion. Even when
he isn't recording at home, he is usually content pursing his
solitary passions of reading, watching films and visiting museums.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, I thought my ultimate happiness would be
tied to some exclusive relationship with a monogamous partner," he
says. "But at some point, I stopped feeling that way. I became so
thrilled by the fact that I could make music, I felt that anything
else would distract me from what I was trying to do.</TE>
<TE>   "If I spend a week in the studio working obsessively on music,
there is a good chance nothing good will come of it. But if I don't
spend a week in the studio working obsessively on music, I know
nothing good is going to come of it."</TE>
<TE>   Moby might apply the same philosophy to his promotional campaign.</TE>
<TE>   When it's clear that the break in shooting is going to be longer
than expected, Moby looks glum and glances my way. I'm ready.</TE>
<TE>   "What are the five worst airports?" I ask the man who has just
taken 14 flights in 18 days.</TE>
<TE>   Moby's face brightens.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you've got to start with San Francisco," he says. "The
airport is closed half the time because of fog. Then, you have to add
Atlanta...."</TE>
<TE>   Moby is happy. He's at work.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Top 5, Moby-StyleAlbums, movies and books Moby recommends:</TE>
<TE>   Albums</TE>
<TE>   Julee Cruise's "Floating Into the Night" (Warner Bros., 1990). "A
consistently beautiful, romantic record."</TE>
<TE>   Massive Attack's "Protection" (Virgin, 1994). "Lots of musicians
seem more comfortable characterizing themselves as either aggressive
macho musicians or very delicate, sensitive musicians. Massive Attack
is comfortable being both."</TE>
<TE>   Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue."</TE>
<TE>   David Bowie's "Low" (RCA, 1977). "A lovely but disconcerting
record."</TE>
<TE>   Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young's "Deja Vu" (Atlantic, 1970).</TE>
<TE>   Movies</TE>
<TE>   "Dead Man Walking" (1995). "The frailty of the human condition was
dealt with in a very graceful way."</TE>
<TE>   "Dogma" (1999). "I can't remember a movie that dealt with the dry,
clinical aspects of religion and presented them in a lighthearted,
entertaining way."</TE>
<TE>   "Fireworks" (1997). "Takeshi Kitano is my favorite living
filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   "Man Facing Southeast" (1986). "This is an Argentine film about a
man who thinks he's a space alien, and you are never quite sure
whether he is or isn't."</TE>
<TE>   "Starship Troopers" (1997). "An art film in the trappings of a
banal, generic science-fiction movie."</TE>
<TE>   Novels</TE>
<TE>   "The Moviegoer" by Walker Percy. "This deals with the crippling,
banal aspects of contemporary life and how we are all on the cusp of
grace and epiphany, but are always running away from it."</TE>
<TE>   "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Cord. "I grew up obsessed with
science-fiction books because I'm basically a geek, and this might be
the best one ever written."</TE>
<TE>   "The Idiot" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. "If someone doesn't have too
much of an attention span, just read the first 200 pages and the last
80 pages. That's where all the action happens."</TE>
<TE>   "A Season in Hell" by Arthur Rimbaud. "His poetry is so explosive,
almost like poetry that is dripping off the fangs of some animal that
has just killed something."</TE>
<TE>   "The Jungle Books" by Rudyard Kipling. "The movie is kinda
frivolous, but the books are deadly serious."</TE>

<DH>Rising sales don't matter to Dashboard Confessional.
Intense interactions with fans do.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's one word you wouldn't expect Chris Carrabba to use to
describe himself, it's "jaded."</LD>
<LD>   Carrabba's rabid audience finds him the epitome of earnest, open,
soul-baring sincerity. His albums--2000's "The Swiss Army Romance"
and last year's "The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most"--are
expressions of emotional pain, and his concerts are group-sharing
sessions, with thousands of young people singing every word to every
song, often louder than Carrabba, who records and performs under the
name Dashboard Confessional.</LD>
<LD>   It's public catharsis presided over by a slight musician whose
songs of heartbreak and emotional displacement include such lyrics as
"Kiss me hard 'cause this is the last time I'll let you," and whose
motto, emblazoned on a banner hanging behind him, is "Fight the Good
Fight."</LD>
<TE>   But "jaded" is the word that the Boca Raton, Fla.-based Carrabba
uses about his state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a facet of everybody's life," says Carrabba, 26, "a point
where you go through thinking, 'What does this all mean? What's
important about this?' When I say 'jaded,' I don't mean I hate
everything. But I'm cataloging what's important, and when I say that
I'm jaded, [I mean that] much less seems so important to me than when
I was 18."</TE>
<TE>   For Carrabba, what really matters is the same thing that has been
central to his art since he launched his Dashboard identity in 1997.
It was a solo, acoustic alternative to the punk-rooted but equally
earnest fury he'd been delivering with bands called the Vacant Andys
and Further Seems Forever. Dashboard sounds something like an
unplugged Blink-182--minus the juvenile silliness--and Carrabba found
an audience that listened intently to his songs, something he relates
to his concurrent experience as an elementary schoolteacher and
administrator. (He still manages to work part time in that role.)</TE>
<TE>   "When I was younger, I'd think having your name in print was the
most important thing. Now it's being there with kids and interacting.
That's all that's important. Writing songs that mean something to me
is all that's important. Some of the songs I'm writing lately kind of
center on that. It's so easy to get away from what's really
important. I'm determined not to do that."</TE>
<TE>   That determination may be tested if his career continues to
develop as it has recently. "The Places You Have Come to Fear the
Most" stands on the threshold of a breakthrough. The album was
released more than a year ago by Los Angeles independent label
Vagrant Records, home to Saves the Day and Get Up Kids, other young
acts in the hyper-sincere "emo" (for emotional) movement of rock.
With Carrabba building his audience through intensive touring (more
than 300 dates a year), word-of-mouth started to spread, and he
started to get breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Birckhead, music booker for "The Late Late Show With Craig
Kilborn" on CBS, discovered Dashboard last year while looking through
his younger sister's CD collection. Birckhead went to a concert and
was so impressed by the audience involvement that he booked Carrabba
on the show.</TE>
<TE>   "The appeal for me was instantaneous," Birckhead says. "It was
acoustic, but it brought up the resurgence of punk music I was
listening to as a teen, like Bad Religion. And he has mainstream
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, the album was at the 100,000 U.S. sales
mark and accelerating. Now MTV has embraced Dashboard, playing the
video for the song "Screaming Infidelities," and Carrabba and his
three bandmates have just taped an "Unplugged" session for the
channel--the first "MTV Unplugged" by an artist without at least a
gold record (500,000 sales). Some influential rock radio stations,
including L.A.'s KROQ-FM (106.7), have also started giving the music
some air time. In addition, a deal is being discussed by Vagrant and
major power Interescope, and if it comes about as expected, it could
further propel Dashboard into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of developments in a short time, but so far
Carrabba's keeping the new distractions at bay.</TE>
<TE>   "The MTV thing, I guess it would feel different if I sat around
waiting to see it on MTV all day. It's not important. The concerts
are the experience I embrace. All the shows I'm doing now sold out
before it started getting played on MTV. It's grown incrementally at
the same pace, every show since the first show I did. Every show
seems to build on the last show. The thing that's strange currently
is that people outside of our music scene have noticed--people at the
Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone, Alternative Press."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Levy, music editor of Rolling Stone, sees a bigger picture.
"Dashboard is just one example, but we're seeing the subculture
recharged, bands crisscrossing the country and creating a national
network of fans that want different music and have great passion,"
Levy says.</TE>
<TE>   "This is someone who two years ago was a virtual unknown and has
built himself up as a touring act, exactly the way that you're
supposed to, the way a band like the Police did back in the late
'70s, or a band like Nirvana did in the ate '80s and early '90s. Can
what happened to them happen to him? I would say no, but I would have
said the exact same thing about the Police and Nirvana."</TE>
<TE>   Carrabba himself cites two other role models: Elvis Costello and
Neil Young.</TE>
<TE>   "What I really admire about [Costello] and model myself on is the
fact that he has challenged his audience and been challenged by his
audience," he says. "And he's done it without alienating the people
who first fell in love with him. I know my fans will let me push the
envelope. Sometimes I play alone, sometimes with a band, sometimes
with electric guitar. We have many tricks. Let's get them all out
there.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch Neil Young, who's been doing this for countless years,
and every time I see a video or record, I think that this is a dude
who must freak out every time he writes a song and plays it for a
friend and actually feeds off the audience. I know it happens, or
he's a great actor. But I think it's real.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, that's the exciting part. It's standing in front of people
and having them blow my mind, even though I'm the supposed focal
point. So if that goes away, I don't think I want to do it anymore.
That's something I'm not jaded on. I think it's the sharks
surrounding those kids I'm jaded on."</TE>

<HD>For Her, It's Always About Community</HD>
<DH>Whether photographing ice-fishing houses or gay couples,
Catherine Opie remains fascinated with interconnected lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA-PHILP</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fourteen white photographs hang on the white walls of the white
gallery. Closer inspection reveals a faint, gray horizon line and
tiny clusters of brightly colored Monopoly-style houses. These
pictures of ice-fishing houses in Minnesota are unlike anything
previously photographed by Catherine Opie, an artist who rose to
prominence with her regal portraits of gays and lesbians.</LD>
<LD>   "Icehouses" is on view through June 15 at Regen Projects in West
Hollywood. The photographs were taken last year when Opie was artist
in residence at Minneapolis' Walker Art Center (a larger exhibition,
"Skyways &amp; Icehouses," is on view there through July 21--skyways are
the enclosed glass corridors linking buildings and protecting
pedestrians from the elements in Minneapolis). Opie is sitting in her
sunny new home in West Adams and remembering chilly Minnesota. "It
interested me that the skyways are to Minneapolis as the freeways are
to L.A.," she says, and adds, "The icehouses were visually amazing."</LD>
<TE>   Photographed in blizzard conditions, each 30-by-40-inch
ice-fishing photograph is a field of blinding white. Opie, who is
considered a masterful technician, usually prints her own
photographs. She made an exception for the "Icehouse" series. To
retain a consistent white tone, she resorted to digital printing,
knowing that the computer could maintain the same exposures for each
photograph. She takes solace in the fact that she had already
accomplished a significant technical feat just by making photographs
with an 8-by-10-inch view camera, each picture requiring 25 minutes
of standing on a frozen lake without freezing the film.</TE>
<TE>   The result surprised even her.</TE>
<TE>   "My work is usually seductive visually and formally," she says.
"But these are pretty in a way that most of my work isn't. They are
just crazy pretty."</TE>
<TE>   It seems more than coincidence that Opie created such luminous
photographs in the year that many of her long-held desires began to
be fulfilled.  Besides the Walker residency, in the last year, she
accepted a tenured position teaching photography at UCLA, bought a
house, fell in love with painter Julie Burleigh, and got pregnant
with the help of a male friend, Rodney Hill, who was director of her
New York gallery, Gorney Bravin + Lee (he has relocated to L.A., to
be a partner at the Marc Foxx Gallery).</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, my dreams have come true," she reflects.</TE>
<TE>   Opie, 41, has been relating to the world through a lens since she
was given an Instamatic for her ninth birthday in Sandusky, Ohio, and
photographed every house and intersection in her neighborhood. Being
creative ran in the family. Her father operated her grandfather's
craft business, so there was an abundant supply of paper, crayons and
paints. Her mother, a physical education teacher, did decoupage.</TE>
<TE>   Her family moved to Rancho Bernardo in north San Diego County in
1974, and a few years later, her parents divorced. Her father did
well in real estate and hoped she would take over his business. Yet
he supported her decision to enroll at San Francisco Art Institute,
where she graduated with a bachelor of fine arts in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "They pushed you so hard to really learn how to make photographs
visually," she recalls. Great technical training came from
photographer Pirkle Jones, who had printed Ansel Adams' pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "They really taught me how to work too," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "I shot everything I saw or thought, and it did a lot for me," she
says. "I got to know my camera completely. I just thought about my
eye and my hand."</TE>
<TE>   While completing her master's degree at CalArts between 1986 and
1988, she documented the master-planned community of Valencia. She
started out hating suburban growth, but finally came to see that the
banal architecture of the suburb yielded an aesthetic of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Opie says that the connection between those early pieces and her
mature work is a fascination with community. In his catalog essay for
the Walker exhibition, Douglas Fogel writes that her "entire artistic
career can be seen as one long road trip across this continent in
search not of the American dream but rather a dream of an idea of
American community."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the work that first attracted the attention of critics
and curators in 1993 involved luscious studio portraits of lesbian
and transgender friends in the leather community.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, as she saw friends dying of AIDS, she had a
strong urge to make this community more visible. She also wanted to
bring dignity to people who were shunned because of their sexual
orientation. Her photographs depicted women with hair growth and
muscles that were brought on by hormone injections; she refused to
identify the subjects by gender.</TE>
<TE>   The work was a personal as well as an artistic milestone. One
self-portrait in the series, chosen for the 1995 Whitney Biennial,
showed her with her head hooded in leather and the word "pervert" cut
into her chest. At that point, she had to inform her parents about
her sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to fit in and be the good corn-fed girl from the
Midwest," she says. "Shifting my work to include a queer identity
component was a big deal for me."</TE>
<TE>   Not that her "Midwestern" yearnings disappeared. In another
self-portrait in the 1993 series, Opie photographed her naked back,
again tattooed with a knife. This time, though, the image was of two
stick-figure women, a small house and the sun coming out from behind
a cloud. After the painful breakup of one relationship, Opie made
this childlike doodle and asked an artist friend to cut it into her
bare back, so that the lines were drawn in blood.</TE>
<TE>   "By placing it on my body, I showed how hard it still is to be
queer and want the idea of family too," Opie says.</TE>
<TE>   Opie was unprepared for the onslaught of media attention that
followed her Whitney debut.</TE>
<TE>   It was, she says, "like, 'Oh there's the pervert.' It's funny when
you make this personal work, and it ends up having this whole life
out there."</TE>
<TE>   She decided her next photographs had to be "radically different,
if I was going to balance this stuff out, if I was going to have a
long career."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by her commute to a job in the photo lab at UC Irvine,
she began to shoot freeways, using the soft-focus style of 19th
century photographs and making platinum prints. "I needed to do
something with concrete sweeping architectural forms," Opie says.
"I've had a car since the age of 16, and, to me, the freeways always
represented this wonderful freedom."</TE>
<TE>   She went on to photograph architecturally challenged mansions in
Beverly Hills and Bel-Air in 1996 and Los Angeles mini-malls in 1997.
"Everything I photograph has the connotation of being messy or of
being a bad thing," she admits. "Why? Mini-malls are so much about
the identity of Los Angeles, and the specificity of the identity
fascinates me. You can discover what neighborhood you're driving
through by looking at signage, whether it is Korean, Chinese or
Spanish. These are the community centers for a neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, she embarked on what she called the "Queer Great American
Road Trip." For 21/2 months, she drove an RV around the country
searching for an alternative to the heterosexual model of a domestic
relationship. She photographed couples and groups of women around a
dining room table, in a backyard, in a swimming pool, and all of them
exude a pleasant ordinariness.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to extend our definitions and often we can't unless it's
pictured," she says. She considers the series a victory, especially
because Al and Tipper Gore have requested that her work be included
in their forthcoming book on the American family.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, a Freund Fellowship from Washington University
led her to teach for two months in St. Louis, where she began an
ongoing series on American cities.</TE>
<TE>   "I do an enormous amount of research," she says. "My library is
filled with books on community and urban politics. I have more books
on urban planning in my library than books on art."</TE>
<TE>   Then in 2000 and 2001, a teaching job at Yale University allowed
her to spend time photographing Wall Street in New York, and the
Walker residency added Minneapolis and the ice-fishing houses to her
list of communities.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the idea that the icehouses are a temporary community,"
Opie says. "They only exist on the ice for about two months, but they
receive pizza delivery, even prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that it messes with the whole economic thing of the house
on the lake," she adds. "Mostly, only the wealthy can have that. Come
winter, even the mechanic at the gas station can pull his house onto
the lake and he has a lake-view property.</TE>
<TE>   "My work bizarrely leads me down these paths and trails," she
says. "And I want everyone to go there with me."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Opie is pleased to be back in Southern California. She
met Burleigh, a professor at Washington University, during her
residency there. As Opie puts it, "We were friends and then we were
girlfriends."</TE>
<TE>   The job at UCLA brought her home to L.A., and Burleigh followed.
With the house in West Adams--a rambling clapboard that could have
been shipped airfreight from the Midwest--and the arrival of Oliver,
born in February, the picture of domesticity that Opie once had
incised on her back is seemingly fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   And for the moment, domestic bliss is more on her mind than either
of her new exhibitions. As a compulsive worker, she has completed at
least one new series every year of the past decade. It's time to slow
down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good I had Oliver, huh?" she says with a grin. "Otherwise,
there would be way too much of my work out there."</TE>
<TE>   While she talks, she looks out her wide-open front door, Oliver
clamped to her breast and the family dog, Nika, sprawled on the floor
next to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so solid in my dream of a house, a woman who wanted to be
married to me, a child," Opie says, looking back to the days of the
stick-figure incision. "I've been trying to find that for a very long
time. I'm so excited to have found someone who wants this as much as
I do."</TE>

<HD>History as Solace</HD>
<DH>Seeking to understand a national tragedy, playwright John
Guare turned to America's past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA ISENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Playwright John Guare was worried. He owed the Signature Theatre a
play, and he didn't have one. Just some notes, some scenes and a lot
of research. "It all was sort of laying there in disarray," he says.
"I didn't know how to pull it together."</LD>
<LD>   Then came Sept. 11. Guare, who lives downtown, not far from the
World Trade Center site, says, "I looked out my window and saw the
nightmare. I went out on the street and saw people covered with white
ash like they'd turned to stone. I went back in to turn on the
television and just felt paralyzed, watching and watching. I had to
do something. I went into my workroom, shut the door and started
writing. I finished the play three weeks later."</LD>
<LD>   Urban chronicler Guare, best known for such tales of contemporary
anguish as "Six Degrees of Separation" and "The House of Blue
Leaves," this time turned to history. Setting his play in 1880s New
York, the Tony-winning playwright deconstructed current events by
reconstructing historical ones.</LD>
<TE>   Opening today at the off-Broadway Signature Theatre's Peter Norton
Space, "A Few Stout Individuals" recounts the final days of Ulysses
S. Grant, the nation's 18th president. Grant, who served from 1869 to
1877, is dying of throat cancer, in terrible financial straits and
writing his memoirs to put bread back on the family table. As Grant
struggles with that book for his publisher, the writer Samuel
Clemens, a gaggle of family members and others try to help, swindle,
cajole and honor him.</TE>
<TE>   Guare had great material to work with. Grant did indeed lose his
money in a financial scandal and miraculously finish his memoirs
shortly before dying. His widow did make a bundle on them. But the
truth of this tale, as in so many of Guare's tales, is filtered
through what a longtime friend, Lincoln Center Theater executive
producer Bernard Gersten, calls Guare's "skewed view of the world and
the inhabitants thereof."</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected and fantastical characters appear and reappear in "A
Few Stout Individuals," much as they usually do in Guare's plays. But
they're less outrageous than the men and women who often populate his
plays, and none of them have names like Lusty, Bananas or Torah.
There are no seeing-eye people for blind dogs, no old ladies on
crutches devoured by cats.</TE>
<TE>   Talking with a reporter between rehearsals, the tall,
aristocratic-looking writer uses elocution that belies his Queens
roots. As he chats, he appears as comfortable talking about his
eccentrics as about his depictions of people like Grant or, for that
matter, J.J. Hunsecker, the Walter Winchell-style gossip columnist
that John Lithgow inhabits across town in the Broadway musical "Sweet
Smell of Success," which Guare adapted.</TE>
<TE>   Guare is clearly fascinated by larger-than-life bad guys. His play
recounts, for instance, how Grant aide Adam Badeau, for instance,
sought the copyright to Grant's memoirs, expressed eagerness to write
them if given freer rein and even tried penning a few pages. "He was
Grant's trusted aide for 20 years off and on," explains Guare, "but
he was an authentic American monster who attached himself to the
Grant family."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Guare continues, "I love those grotesques, which J.J.
Hunsecker most certainly is. Monsters are people who pursue power for
their own ends. Hunsecker and Badeau live on information to use as
ammunition."</TE>
<TE>   Guare's adaptation of Ernest Lehman's novella and the 1957
Lehman-Clifford Odets screenplay for "Sweet Smell" opened on Broadway
recently to largely negative reviews. Last week, it received seven
Tony nominations, including one for Guare. And it has had good box
office receipts, leading Guare to comment that he's gratified
theatergoers "have not been distracted by the venom" of the reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Guare tells vividly how, as a boy, he'd go with his father to the
corner newsstand at night to see what Winchell had to say. At 14, he
first went into Manhattan on his own and "the city was mine."</TE>
<TE>   Guare left New York for Georgetown University in Washington, then
Yale University School of Drama in Connecticut, but he immediately
headed back to New York after a stint in the Air Force in the early
'60s. Lured by a poster he saw advertising Lanford Wilson's play "The
Madness of Lady Bright," he stopped in the tiny Caffe Cino, often
credited with launching the off-off-Broadway movement in the late
'50s. He saw the production, then came back the next day with some of
his own plays to show theatrical producer Joseph Cino (who Guare says
worked as a steam presser in a laundry by day and produced plays by
night).</TE>
<TE>   "I had just gotten out of the Air Force, didn't know what I was
going to do and said I want to work here. Joe said, 'Well, in this
period, I'm only doing plays by Aquarians.' So I showed him my
driver's license," says Guare, who was born on Feb. 5, 1938. "And he
said, 'Good, I've been looking for you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Guare grew up in Queens' Jackson Heights, but spent every summer
on Long Island's East Atlantic Beach. There, at age 11, he wrote
three plays that were staged in his friend Bobby Shlomm's garage
across the street. For his 12th birthday, fledgling playwright Guare
received a Royal portable typewriter from his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Theater was in his genes. His great-uncles toured in vaudeville,
and Guare is the nephew of theatrical agent Billy Grady. Grady, who
represented such performers as Al Jolson, W.C. Fields and Will
Rogers, was also for many years head of casting at MGM. There, says
Guare, "his big claim to fame was what he said about Fred Astaire's
screen test: 'balding, can't sing, can't act, can dance a little.'"</TE>
<TE>   The playwright had his own audition with Grady. "He'd gone on a
nationwide hunt to find the ideal young American boy to play
Huckleberry Finn," Guare says, "and I was determined to play him. He
came to our house because he was so fed up with kids, and I took it
as an opportunity to audition for him. He stormed out of our house,
thinking my mother had set me up to do it, and didn't speak to me for
10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Guare re-created that experience in Act 2, Scene 1 of "The House
of Blue Leaves," his first big theatrical success. Former New York
Public Theater associate producer Gersten recalls when the play first
premiered at the small Truck and Warehouse Theater in the East
Village in 1971, "We at the Public, who thought we had a lock on
young playwrights, were suddenly jealous. He is a remarkable
storyteller, a highly, highly gifted near-genius of a playwright."</TE>
<TE>   Gersten, whose Lincoln Center Theater has produced four Guare
plays, including an acclaimed 1986 revival of "The House of Blue
Leaves," lauds Guare's "smart voice, his manic yearnings, his keen
eye"--all traits the playwright applies to chronicling worlds both
public and private. For "The House of Blue Leaves," for instance, he
drew not only on Uncle Billy, but also on the pope's visit to New
York City in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   "The playwright Sidney Kingsley has said, 'Write what you know
about but know what you write about,'" Guare says, repeating the
phrase a few times. He turns it around on his tongue, staring out
into space as if debating whether he agrees with that notion. "Yeah,"
he decides, "you have to write what you know about. That's all we
have."</TE>
<TE>   Research helps, of course. Guare has turned to 19th century
America before, for his '80s trilogy "Lydie Breeze," "Gardenia" and
"Women and Water," and it is clearly a period that interests him.</TE>
<TE>   "A Few Stout Individuals" came about rather casually. A few years
ago, Guare was asked at a party if he'd ever read Grant's
best-selling, two-volume "Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant."
Guare said, "Of course not," and was immediately chastised.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued, however, he went out and bought a copy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was bowled over," the playwright says. "I was so bowled over
that I wondered how this drunken general and semi-corrupt president
came to write this extraordinary work. I went to his biography and
the circumstances under which he wrote it were so amazing that I
said, 'My God, this is a play here.'</TE>
<TE>   "It was tragic and weird and crazy. The people in his household
were so remarkable that I had to find out more about the period. I
did a ton of research, and it just kept leading me into what was
happening in his life at the time. The financial scandal that Grant
was in was like Enron today. Not only was he in disrepute, but it
left him penniless.</TE>
<TE>   "The more the material manifested itself, the more I was at home
in it," Guare continues. "It was about things I was interested in.
How we make art. Who makes art. What are the reasons for memory. How
we are all watching life through our own tiny little reality and miss
the big picture."</TE>
<TE>   The Signature Theatre is celebrating its 10th anniversary by
asking each of its former resident playwrights for a new play. That
includes Guare, whose residency spanned the Signature's 1998-99
season.</TE>
<TE>   "These world premieres continue the exploration of their work,"
says Signature's founding artistic director, James Houghton. "This
seemed a way to celebrate the theater they helped build by honoring
them with more work."</TE>
<TE>   Another Signature playwright is Edward Albee, and Guare says he
kept running into Albee, asking what page he was on of his play, then
worrying as the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright reported on his
progress. "I owed them a play, and I didn't know what it was going to
be."</TE>
<TE>   That all changed, of course, last fall. "Every one of us had to
process [Sept. 11] in our own way," Houghton says. "John processed
his feelings and his experience through writing. A common theme of
his, and one very much in this play, is how we all have desperate
needs to connect to one another."</TE>
<TE>   Guare was writing this play at a time when we were really thinking
about our identity as Americans, adds the play's director, Michael
Greif. "He chose another moment in American history, the end of the
19th century, when Americans were striving to define themselves as a
people.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of resonance with his other work," Greif continues.
"There's a similar affection for the characters and the way he roots
for them in very difficult situations. He creates a very ferocious
environment, an urgent and great need, which he expresses in a
comedic and farcical way. And that comedy often dances side by side
with a much more serious purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Guare, whose plays have nearly all been honored with one award or
another, although not always critical or audience success, would
certainly agree on his intention. Writing plays, he says, "is the way
I get to tell the truth about what we see, to challenge an audience
and take them to places they might not go, to put things together in
a way they haven't been put together before."</TE>
<TE>   Having recently written two film scripts, the screenwriter of
Louis Malle's 1980 movie "Atlantic City" is now "sort of" working on
a new play. "I had 12 productions in the last four years--including
revivals and two versions of one play--and I am sort of taking a
breath for the summer. But I love the theater, and writing is the way
I get to work in the theater.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody asked John Gielgud how he picks a part and he said he
never picks a part. He said he picks the world of the play, because
you have to live there. That's what playwrights do: We make attempts
at building worlds."</TE>

<HD>New York's Shifting Art Scene</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JASON EDWARD KAUFMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The shutdown of the Museum of Modern Art's 53rd Street headquarters
and its temporary move to Queens are only the most prominent examples
of how the city's modern and contemporary art scene will be
transformed during the next few years. Most of New York's major
institutions have already begun to redefine themselves and
recalibrate their missions in a new century--in the same vein as
revamps in the planning stages in Los Angeles at, among others, the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the UCLA Hammer Museum.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, with the exception of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
virtually all have announced plans--or hopes--to expand. Just as
important, many have begun to refocus their exhibition plans and even
their collecting strategies.</LD>
<LD>   MoMA has made its plans clear:</LD>
<TE>   "What we've tried to do in the last five or six years is to shift
the critical center of our interests from the first half of the 20th
century to the latter half of the 20th century, and to continue to
collect aggressively in the present," MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry
says. "Ten years from now, I would hope that the majority of our
shows would have been exhibitions that focused on art since the
'60s."</TE>
<TE>   All over town, similar strategizing is beginning to push the
traditional boundaries. Collectively, these changes are redrawing the
map of the world's modern and contemporary art capital.</TE>
<TE>   MoMA</TE>
<TE>   With its renowned collections touring the globe and operations
shifted to Queens, the limelight might begin to dim, at least
temporarily, on MoMA. Will museum-goers take the subway or MoMA's
shuttle buses out to Queens, or simply visit other Manhattan
attractions? MoMA hopes its roster of inaugural shows will make a
Manhattan location moot.</TE>
<TE>   The offerings this summer at MoMA QNS include "AUTObodies," a
selection of cars from the permanent collection, and "Tempo," an
international show about the dimension of time. Later in the year,
surveys of contemporary works on paper and visionary architectural
drawings are scheduled. But the meat of the calendar kicks off in
2003 with "Matisse Picasso," a potential blockbuster followed by
retrospectives of painter Max Beckmann, photographer Ansel Adams, and
Venezuelan painter Armando Reveron. Prints by Kiki Smith, and
paintings, objects and graphics by Dieter Roth are scheduled for
2004, the latter to be presented in collaboration with the P.S. 1
Contemporary Art Center, also in Queens and a MoMA partner since
1999. Because MoMA, perhaps more than any museum, has codified the
canon of modern art, the reinstallation of its permanent collection
will be closely watched--and just exactly how the story of major
figures and movements will be augmented awaits the successor of Kirk
Varnedoe as head of the department of painting and sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum of Art</TE>
<TE>   Under director Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim has become a
multinational conglomerate with affiliates in Venice, Berlin, Las
Vegas and, most famously, Bilbao, Spain. He has sent the collection
on the road and given over the Frank Lloyd Wright rotunda to an
eclectic mix of shows. Although established as a museum of abstract
and modern art, under Krens the Guggenheim has exhibited African and
Chinese antiquities, motorcycles, Armani dresses, Brazilian colonial
art, Frank Gehry's designs and a retrospective of Norman Rockwell.
Critics say he'll show whatever will attract crowds and funding, but
Krens says the complaints are unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly over 80% of what we do is right down the middle of the
plate in terms of the general perception of our core competency," he
says, reeling off a list of retrospectives that includes Roy
Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Ellsworth Kelly and Nam June Paik.</TE>
<TE>   The motorcycles, Armani dresses and Gehry shows, he says, reflect
his hope that "within another decade or so, we would have a very
well-established department of architecture and design." He adds that
the Gehry exhibition attracted more than 400,000 visitors, making it
"by far the best-attended exhibition we've ever had." He defends the
African, Chinese, and Brazilian shows as assembling superb objects
that might otherwise not have been seen in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're developing a program, do you string just one string
on your violin because it's the one that's closest to you and the one
you knew? The variety actually enhances the program and the
audience," he says, adding that in the last eight years, annual
attendance has increased from about 600,000 to more than a million.</TE>
<TE>   Krens feels the international Guggenheim has "an obligation to
look at other cultures. In the last 20 years, the whole notion of a
globally conscious contemporary art is emerging all over the world,
not just in New York City and Paris."</TE>
<TE>   But his future exhibition calendar stays strictly within Europe
and the U.S., with a survey of contemporary art this summer followed
by retrospectives of sculptor and filmmaker Matthew Barney, Russian
painter Kasimir Malevich and Pop artist James Rosenquist next year,
as well as a survey of photo-based art from the collection.</TE>
<TE>   Krens would like to build a downtown Guggenheim, designed by Frank
Gehry. But several months ago, in the wake of budget problems caused
by the events of Sept. 11, he laid off scores of workers, canceled an
exhibition of Scottish Conceptual artist Douglas Gordon, and
postponed the Barney and Malevich shows, all planned for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "The Guggenheim is hardly in trouble," he says, "but the reality
is that we did get hit hard by Sept. 11 because we are more dependent
than most institutions on admissions revenues, and 50% of our
audience comes from abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Whitney Museum of American Art</TE>
<TE>   In an increasingly global art world, does it make sense to focus
only on "American" art? Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney,
thinks it does. The world may be commercially integrating, but
culturally it remains a fractious place riven by local and national
identities, and the Whitney is seeking to address this issue in its
shows. An upcoming exhibition, "The American Seen," will survey art
made abroad in the last 10 years that takes as its subject the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "The premise is to inquire about the nature of how Americans are
perceived in the rest of the world," Anderson says. "I think it will
be a watershed in how we see ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   During the past two decades, under directors Thomas Armstrong and
then David Ross, the Whitney became linked closely with commercial
galleries and modish trends, offering mid-career retrospectives to
artists whose reputations often declined later.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson says he plans to exhibit less-known work, beginning with
a summer show of second-generation Abstract Expressionist Joan
Mitchell. There will also be shows featuring feminist body-and-land
artist Ana Mendieta, architect John Hejduk, sculptor Isamu Noguchi,
and drawings by Arshile Gorky.</TE>
<TE>   But traditionally the Whitney has been an advocate of living
artists, and Anderson says that won't change, citing future shows of
drawings by Ed Ruscha, as well as of work by Israeli-born
photographer Michal Rovner and New York architects Diller and
Scofidio. He adds that for the current Biennial (on view until May
26), the museum doled out hundreds of thousands of dollars for
artists to create work.</TE>
<TE>   "This advocacy goes back to our founding, and it separates us from
other museums that are very cautious about their involvement with
artists," he says.</TE>
<TE>   With the building filled with loan shows, 99% of the collection
remains in storage. The lack of space is but one of many "inherited
inefficiencies" of the museum's Marcel Breuer-designed home, built in
1966 to accommodate 200,000 visitors a year and now handling several
times that number.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has hired Rem Koolhaas to devise a master plan for
expansion along Madison Avenue. Despite recent financial
difficulties--again caused by Sept. 11--that precipitated layoffs and
the cancellation of a retrospective devoted to Post-Minimalism
pioneer Eva Hesse, Anderson predicts that within the next six years,
the Whitney will have broken ground.</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan Museum of Art</TE>
<TE>   Here's a no-brainer: What are the chances of the Met exhibiting a
close-up photograph of oral sex? Slim to zero, right? Yet there it
was--in a white, fur-lined vitrine, no less--along with dozens of
other examples of fine-art erotica in the recent Surrealism survey.
The exhibition, organized by London's Tate Modern, is a rarity at the
Met: a thematic survey of 20th century painting and sculpture. (Last
year's "School of Paris" exhibition was less a cogent survey than a
catchy title for the recently acquired Gelman collection.)</TE>
<TE>   There have been surveys of modern photography, design, costume and
prints, but unlike other encyclopedic museums, the Met for decades
has been content to leave the broader story of modern art in the
hands of MoMA, the Guggenheim and the Whitney. The Surrealism show
signals a change. Already there is a second important modern survey
on the calendar: a show of 20th century African American art to open
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Standard 20th century fare at the Met has been one-artist shows of
painters Dali, Magritte, De Kooning and others. Sculpture by Rodin,
David Smith and Ellsworth Kelly has appeared in the roof garden, with
Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen now on view.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to shy away from vast omnibus subjects that get very
fuzzy intellectually as to what their demarcation lines are," says
the director, Philippe de Montebello, adding, "We do like monographic
shows. They're highly focused and they bring a particular artistic
personality out to the fore."</TE>
<TE>   Among those coming up are shows of Vija Celmins' prints this fall
and contemporary photographs by Thomas Struth next year. Portraits by
photographer Richard Avedon open in September, Charles Sheeler
photographs are planned for next year, and a Philip Guston painting
show is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   The Met has gradually filled out its patchy holdings of modern
art, adding strength in Futurism, the School of Paris and Abstract
Expressionism, mainly through gifts. In contemporary art, however,
the museum lags far behind the city's other museums, having acquired
only a few major works such as Jasper Johns' "White Flag" and, with
much fanfare last year, a video by Bill Viola.</TE>
<TE>   De Montebello says the charter obliges the museum "to collect in
the present," but he seems to think it makes better sense to allow
some dust to settle before adding to the collection. "I think the
curators in the future will be asked to skip a generation or two in
their purchases of contemporary art," he says. "There's always plenty
of time to buy the art of today tomorrow. It's not a diminishing
commodity." And the museum is far more likely to assemble a postwar
collection through donations than through purchases.</TE>
<TE>   The Pierpont Morgan Library</TE>
<TE>   The Morgan owns drawings, literary, historical and musical
manuscripts, and books from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, and
director Charles Pierce has decided to move cautiously into 20th
century art.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Morgan proclaimed its entry into the field with an
exhibition of Modernist drawings from New York private collections.
Now, with "Pierre Matisse and His Artists," the library is showing
painting and sculpture, including works by Miro, Calder, Giacometti,
Chagall, Balthus and others. But the Morgan's focus, Pierce says,
will be on drawings.</TE>
<TE>   "Although there are collections of 20th century drawings at our
peer institutions, I didn't think any one of them was as interested
in 20th century drawing as they were in 20th century painting and
sculpture, photography, three-dimensional objects, and so on. So it
seemed to me that there was a gap that we could fill," says Pierce,
adding that his trustees have been supportive of the change.</TE>
<TE>   He would like the library to have eight or 10 masterworks by each
of the major figures through Jackson Pollock, and is willing to leave
more recent work to a successor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not as keen at this point in organizing exhibitions of the
alleged masters of the end of the 20th century because I think there
is less agreement among knowledgeable people about who these masters
are, and also one gets into the very tricky business of exhibiting
works of living artists, and that is something the Morgan has not
done."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many of the New York museums, the Morgan building will be
updated. Next April, the Morgan will close for three years to build
an expansion designed by Renzo Piano.</TE>
<TE>   As yet, no modern art exhibition is on the upcoming calendar.
Pierce feels it is important for the Morgan to mount a 20th century
show every few years, "but it mustn't be at the expense of our
commitment to the earlier field."</TE>
<TE>   Brooklyn Museum of Art</TE>
<TE>   The encyclopedic Brooklyn Museum of Art's chronic dilemma has been
how to attract visitors from Manhattan. The only proven method has
been to mount must-see exhibitions like the Gustave Courbet and
Louise Bourgeois retrospectives of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Director Arnold Lehman hasn't given up on that approach--he's
presented retrospectives of Lee Krasner and Kerry James Marshall, as
well as "Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi
Collection," which created a controversy that put Brooklyn in the
spotlight, for better or worse.</TE>
<TE>   But Lehman is more concerned with reinventing the institution for
its local audience, rather than luring the art-going crowd from MoMA
or the Met. To that end, he is "rethinking the entire program,"
aiming to make it more relevant to a diverse audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Our show is not going to look like a Metropolitan Museum show.
That I can guarantee you," he says. "We're talking to different
audiences. Our goal is to have an audience made up of at least 50%
people of color. That in itself changes how we look at what we do,"
he says. The strategy, he adds, is to examine "social engagement
through contemporary art."</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, he will open new galleries for postwar art that
"are going to speak to our visitors in a manner that our colleague
institutions are not doing." In the American galleries, this strategy
already has resulted in thematic clusters of works with lengthy text
panels and video monitors.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman doesn't know what themes the new displays will be organized
by, but he says pop culture will likely play a part. Moreover, he's
put up a "Star Wars" exhibition, and will soon bring the British duo
Gilbert &amp; George, the newly acquired feminist icon "The Dinner
Party," by Judy Chicago, and a retrospective of work by Jean-Michel
Basquiat, one of the few artists deified by being in the movies. The
museum is embarking on a physical transformation to make its
Beaux-Arts building more "community-friendly," with a spacious
entrance plaza and lobby slated to reopen by early 2004. "My hope is
that you won't know what to expect from us. If you were able to do
that, I haven't done my job."</TE>

<HD>A Rare Chance to Act Their Ages</HD>
<DH>At El Portal, three veteran actresses have fun bonding as
they reprise and revise a tale of high jinks at seventysomething.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hit it, girls!</LD>
<LD>   Charlotte Rae, Jane Kean and Marni Nixon just met the day before.
But you wouldn't know it. The three have bonded like lifelong
friends. The veterans of Broadway, nightclubs, television and movies
are gabbing up a storm around a small table in an otherwise empty
room at El Portal Theatre. It's their lunch break from rehearsals for
the concert revival of the 1971 John Kander-Fred Ebb musical, "70,
Girls, 70," opening Thursday at the North Hollywood theater.</LD>
<LD>   Rae, 76, and Kean, 78, have brought their lunches. Nixon, the baby
of the group at 72, is waiting rather impatiently for a salad from
Pink Dot. Lively, funny and gossipy--most of their stories are
strictly off the record--the three are members of a mutual admiration
society. "We both performed in nightclubs," says Kean, looking over
at Rae, who is eating fruit and hard-boiled eggs.</LD>
<TE>   "Today they call it cabaret, but we then called it nightclubs,"
Rae says. "I did a lot of satire. I did the Bon Soir, Cafe
Society...."</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that these were very famous women," says Nixon, who
appeared two years ago at the Ahmanson in "James Joyce's The Dead"
and is known for ghost-singing Deborah Kerr in "The King and I,"
Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair
Lady."</TE>
<TE>   "I was thrilled to be part of this cast," Nixon says. "I had heard
so much about them."</TE>
<TE>   Based on Peter Coke's play "A Breath of Spring," the wacky musical
comedy "70, Girls, 70" focuses on a group of retired entertainers
living in a hotel that is in danger of being torn down. Through a
series of quirky circumstances, the performers decide the only way to
save the hotel from the wrecking ball is to steal mink coats from New
York City's toniest shops and sell them, using the money to purchase
the hotel. Besides Rae, Kean and Nixon, this production also stars
Robert Mandan of "Soap" fame and William Schallert, forever known to
baby boomers as Patty Duke's father on "The Patty Duke Show."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its lively Kander and Ebb score, which includes "Old
Folks," "Coffee in a Cardboard Cup," "Boom Ditty Boom" and "Go Visit
Your Grandmother," and a cast that included  Mildred Natwick, Hans
Conried and Lillian Roth, "70, Girls, 70" ran for only 35
performances when it opened on Broadway in April 1971. Tragedy had
struck the production: Broadway star David Burns had died on stage
during tryouts in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "My best friend, mentor, Dutch uncle, surrogate father was David
Burns," says director Jim Brochu. "I was at all the rehearsals with
David. It was a show that I just loved."</TE>
<TE>   Directing "70, Girls, 70," he says, "is a 30-year dream come
true."</TE>
<TE>   But Norman Martin's book, Brochu acknowledges, never worked. "It
has been rewritten over the course of the past 30 years," Brochu
says, adding that the original never had a focus. "There were 22
people in the original cast, and each had their own story. Now there
are only eight lead actors, so we really focus on the gang." For this
production, Kander and Ebb have written a new song. "I Move On,"
which Rae sings.</TE>
<TE>   Because of financial and time considerations, the show is being
done as a concert. "I wanted to let the production values go away and
let the book and the musical and lyrics shine through and tell the
story as laser-focused as we can," Brochu says.</TE>
<TE>   "The wonderful thing about this musical is that they do step out
of the book and say, 'We're doing our number now.' The numbers are
going to be staged, whereas the book is pretty much going to be in
hand."</TE>
<TE>   None of the actresses saw the show in 1971. "We weren't born
then," says Kean, who appeared in the 1960s version of "The
Honeymooners" as Trixie. "We are wearing age makeup."</TE>
<TE>   "I was living in Seattle in the '70s," Nixon says. "I was working
in New York off and on, but I wasn't aware of the show until years
later. I do 'Go Visit Your Grandmother' in my own one-woman show.
That's how come I know that song."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon describes her character, Eunice, as ditsy and eager, akin to
Betty White in television's "The Golden Girls."</TE>
<TE>   "She's sort of in a different place, not really dumb. She has her
own world going on. That is my take on it." She glances over at Rae,
who did a staged reading of the revised version of "70, Girls, 70" in
New York two years ago. "You've done it before," she says to her
co-star. "Is that about the right take?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," says Rae, who appeared on Broadway as Mammy Yokum in "Li'l
Abner" as well as the TV series "Car 54, Where Are You?" and "The
Facts of Life." "You are on the right track. Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Rae's Ida, the mastermind behind the fur thefts, is a jolly soul
who is keeping a secret from her hotel mates. "She accidentally,
because of circumstances, lifts a thermometer from a store," she
says. Ida becomes so exhilarated after her shoplifting experience
that she begins taking furs from the likes of Bloomingdale's.</TE>
<TE>   "She talks everyone into realizing they are going to tear down the
hotel. Where are they going to live? They are all wonderful actors
who are in the teatime of their life. Nobody cares two cents about
them. So she says, 'Let's have a fur heist.'"</TE>
<TE>   Kean's Gert is the drama queen. "At first I don't want to
participate. A gang at our age? Ridiculous," Kean says. "But finally,
to save the hotel, I agree to go along with it."</TE>
<TE>   "We are Robin Hoods," Nixon says. "We are kicking up our heels and
having fun doing it."</TE>
<TE>   The rehearsal schedule covers a scant two weeks. "It's insane,"
says Rae with a good-natured roll of her eyes. Kean points out that
it reminds her of doing summer stock when she was an ingenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a whole summer in Rhode Island at a theater by the sea,"
she recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been there," Rae says.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be doing one play at night and then rehearsing for the
play next week during daytime," Kean says. "I think once you do that,
it's wonderful training."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't do summer stock," Nixon says. "But I wish I had. I wish
I had had all of that training."</TE>
<TE>   Kean takes a bite of her chicken salad. "Didn't you work with
Liberace?" she asks Nixon. "I know he was very fond of you."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I toured with him," Nixon says with a warm smile. "I just
learned so much about show business. He would make all the
orchestrations for you. He had his hairdresser do my hair, and he
would design my costumes. He even designed my suitcase."</TE>
<TE>   None of the actresses needs to work these days, but they still
love to ply their craft. "We are offered things, but sometimes they
are things we don't want to do," Rae says. In the case of "70, Girls,
70," she adds, "it's not like 'Gee, we get a chance to work,' but
'It's such a wonderful show.'"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a luxury to work today," Kean adds. "It's not that you have
to work, but you do something that you enjoy. We need to exercise
those acting musicals. It's very important to keep up the timing."</TE>
<TE>   For Nixon, this gig is all about having fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget about the money," she says. "Forget about the small
theaters. Let's have some fun--good, fun theater with good people.
You are working with people your equal and going to have some fun
with your craft."</TE>

<HD>That Exposed Feeling</HD>
<DH>Diane Lane's new film, 'Unfaithful,' calls on her to reveal
parts of herself--body and soul--that have been kept under wraps for
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARE KLEINEDLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman on a train is racked with an overwhelming tide of emotions.
As she stares straight ahead, her watery eyes convey a deep sadness,
but her lips are stretched out in a wide grin. She shakes
uncontrollably, but it's difficult to tell whether her body is
convulsing from laughter or sobs.</LD>
<LD>   "Her face mirrors this kind of extraordinary confusion:
excitement, guilt and sadness, because she's crying but she's also
hysterical with laughter all at the same time. Quite honestly, I was
amazed," director Adrian Lyne says.</LD>
<LD>   It's a scene from Lyne's latest venture into the sexual jungle,
"Unfaithful," and the actress he's describing is Diane Lane. What's
happening is this: Lane's character, suburban mom Constance Sumner,
is reflecting on her tryst--the first of many--with her new lover in
Manhattan. With no words and no cuts during the take, Lane expresses
Constance's feelings of both liberation and mortification.</LD>
<TE>   Lane says her acting in the scene came naturally. "That's how I
freak out. I do that in my kitchen about a couple times a year. Not
about such wonderful flashback material, of course," she says. "It
wasn't scripted that way, but Adrian just told me to go for it, so I
said sure. After a day on this movie, that [motivation] wasn't so
hard to find."</TE>
<TE>   Finding a part like this, however, hasn't been easy for Lane, who
has been acting for three decades and has more than 35 films to her
credit. Talented and beautiful, Lane has long seemed poised on the
verge of real stardom--but somehow it has never happened. When "The
Perfect Storm" hit theaters in 2000, many in Hollywood felt that the
actress (who played opposite Mark Wahlberg in the big-budget film)
would finally get a major dose of recognition. After years of playing
lead roles in successful, small-budget films and supporting roles in
not-so-successful, big-budget movies, Lane would surely reap the
obvious benefits of that box office smash.</TE>
<TE>   Things didn't exactly work out that way; in fact, they pretty much
remained the same. The movie was a box office hit, but not the
blockbuster some had anticipated. Which for Lane wasn't necessarily a
bad thing--she has steady work, respect from her peers and, most
important, a life she can live with.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really enjoy publicity except maybe accolades of some
sort that you can earn over a long period of time because you keep
moving, growing, changing and improving," says Lane, 37, between sips
of tea during a recent interview at a Westwood restaurant. "If a
person hits a bull's-eye target, then you've been over-defined, and
you've found yourself fighting an image that you didn't mean to
create. Fame is a funny animal: It can really turn around and bite
you like a cat."</TE>
<TE>   With "Unfaithful," the cat might be at Lane's door. The 20th
Century Fox release opened last week to glowing reviews for Lane
(although reviews for the film were more mixed). Lane plays a
cheating wife whose actions result in tragic consequences. Although
her character is happily married to successful businessman Edward
Sumner (Richard Gere), a series of circumstances literally throws her
into the arms of a handsome French bookseller (Olivier Martinez).
When Edward discovers the affair, he surprises himself and everyone
involved with rage that eventually turns their lives upside-down.</TE>
<TE>   The role of the philanderer was tough for Lane, requiring her to
act out explicit sex scenes and portray a wide range of
vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like having a baby, and having had one, that's saying a
lot," says Lane, laughing. "It was as exhausting as it appears to be,
and there were a lot of takes. Adrian is a taskmaster that way; he
just pulled the performance through and had a lot of faith that I had
more in me."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne found Lane to be sexy and refined yet unguarded. For
"Unfaithful," she jokes that she was more naked than she'd been "in
the last 10 years of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne, whose best-known films revolve around adultery and its
disastrous consequences ("Fatal Attraction," "Indecent Proposal")
chose Lane for the part after seeing her in the 1999 indie film "A
Walk on the Moon."</TE>
<TE>   The 61-year-old director said he needed an actress who could
portray a wife and mother involved in a torrid sexual affair yet
still be a woman whom audiences could like. The draw of "Unfaithful"
(which is loosely based on the 1969 French film "La Femme Infidel")
is just that: Although Constance and Edward make horribly wrong
choices, moviegoers want them to pull through together. And
Martinez's character (Paul Martel) is neither a predator nor a
hopeless romantic, but rather a fairly normal guy (albeit one who
looks as if he stepped out of an episode of "Red Shoe Diaries") who
gets caught up in a heated, adulterous affair.</TE>
<TE>   "What scared me was that maybe, at the end of the second act, I
wouldn't have a movie anymore," Lyne says. "Because if the audience
doesn't want Edward and Constance to be together again, then the
movie is over. The thing with a film like this is, if you see the
acting, then you're dead. I think acting is a misnomer, really. They
either are the characters or it's no good."</TE>
<TE>   But after just a few days of shooting, Lyne knew he had nothing to
worry about. In a scene in which Constance arrives at Paul's
apartment to explore the budding friendship, he asks to take her
coat. She mistakes "coat" for "clothes" and her embarrassment is
impossible to hide.</TE>
<TE>   "She turned scarlet," says Lyne, raising his voice. "I mean she
blushed to the root and my jaw just dropped. I have never seen
anybody blush on screen before."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of drama coach Burt Lane and singer and actress
Colleen Farrington, Lane started performing at age 6. Her first job
was in Andrei Serban's "Medea" at the La Mama Experimental Theater
Company in New York, and she continued acting in Serban-produced
plays for the next several years. At the age of 14, she starred in "A
Little Romance" with Laurence Olivier, who likened her to a young
Grace Kelly. That accolade landed her photo on the cover of the
August 1979 issue of Time magazine, with a cover line that read:
"Hollywood Whiz Kids."</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, Lane continued to work steadily in films such as
"The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish." Then, in 1984, she worked
back-to-back on two major Hollywood productions: "Streets of Fire,"
with Michael Pare and Willem Dafoe, and "The Cotton Club,"
co-starring Gere. Even as a 19-year-old, remembers Gere, the actress
left a lasting impression.</TE>
<TE>   "She was just a kid, but she was in her skin at that point. She
was in her body, which is extremely rare for an actress," says Gere,
52. "And she still has that kind of innate ability to be comfortable
in her own skin, which makes it more meaningful when she gets into a
character's skin. She's changed in the sense that she's had a life
since then; she's been married and divorced and she's had a kid, but
all that just makes her even richer. It all comes through."</TE>
<TE>   When "Cotton Club" failed to live up to expectations, Lane says,
she "freaked out and ran away."</TE>
<TE>   "In my naivete at 19, I thought, 'Well, I'm in two huge films and
certainly one of them is going to be successful.' I had listened to
producers, but when have you ever heard a producer say their film is
not going to be a hit?" says Lane, grinning. "So the movies were
notoriously unsuccessful compared to their expectations, and people
used a lot of words they didn't realize were hurtful to describe the
lack of success ... because it's show business. It's not show love,
show appreciation, show respect, show adoration. It's show business."</TE>
<TE>   Lane left Hollywood for her mother's house in Georgia and started
work on a different kind of project. Since her parents' divorce when
she was a toddler, Lane had always been closer to her father. The
relationship with her mother was strained even further during her
rebellious teenage years.</TE>
<TE>   "I hadn't been close to my mom for a long time, so we had a lot of
homework to do. We had to repair our relationship because I wanted my
mother back. It was nice to be there, put some meat on my bones with
her Southern fried chicken," Lane says.</TE>
<TE>   Her career benefited from the much-needed retreat. In 1989, she
was nominated for an Emmy for her portrayal of Lorena Wood in TV's
landmark miniseries "Lonesome Dove." Throughout the first half of the
'90s, she continued to work steadily, earning critical praise for her
performance as Stella in the 1995 TV production of "A Streetcar Named
Desire."</TE>
<TE>   The latter part of that decade saw Lane taking on more complex,
cinematic features, such as "A Walk on the Moon." Directed by actor
Tony Goldwyn, "Moon" is also about a cheating wife, but the story is
more about coming-of-age than lustful angst. Lane played a repressed
housewife who follows her heart and discovers her sexuality in 1969
at the time of Woodstock and the first manned landing on the moon.</TE>
<TE>   "Diane was not the natural choice to play a Jewish girl from
Brooklyn, and when I first met with her, she kept telling me how she
was wrong for the part," Goldwyn says. "But when I started to look at
her work, I saw something inside of her.... Deep down inside, she has
this intelligence and complexity."</TE>
<TE>   Although the movie wasn't a huge hit financially, her work
impressed audiences. "There were a lot of women who came up to me,
filled with this overflowing gratitude that their experience made it
to the screen," Lane says. "It was funny to me, because I hadn't
acknowledged that demographic of real people."</TE>
<TE>   Lane downplays her considerable beauty--a beauty that seems to get
richer as she ages. She wears little makeup, and her hair is pulled
from her face in a casual ponytail. She looks put together in a skirt
and cardigan, but far from glamorous.</TE>
<TE>   Lane is a single mother of an 8-year-old daughter (with her
ex-husband, actor Christopher Lambert). She's currently single
("'Dating'" is such an odd word. You're either in a relationship or
you're not," she says) and spends her off-time doing mom things like
taking her daughter to school and back, going to the movies and
painting when she feels inspired.</TE>
<TE>   "Motherhood is quite a consuming and very rewarding job, and one
that I take like church--it's very serious to me. I mean, any parent
who's worth their salt is worried about making the wrong decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Although her daughter is already two years older than Lane was
when she started in the business, Lane doesn't seem overly concerned
that her child might want to follow in her footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   If she wanted to become an actress, "I would say, 'Theater,
theater, theater!'" Lane says. "It's something that feeds you back
and gives you strength. It's culturally relevant in the sense that in
the dark, we tell stories. There's a certain reverence and respect
not only for the performer, but for the material itself."</TE>
<TE>   Lane's early start in theater has clearly contributed to her
success in a business in which child actors are generally washed up
by the time they're 15. With a slew of former teenage actors the
focus of numerous "True Hollywood Stories," the fact that Lane has
managed to avoid a similar fate is quite a feat. To some young
actors, she's something of a role model.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I love acting, it's hard when you're trying to
balance your studies, friends and life on a movie set," says Anna
Paquin, who was 15 when she played Lane's daughter in "A Walk on the
Moon." "She could relate directly to that, because she's been there.
And she's still acting, which is really reassuring and so nice to
see."</TE>
<TE>   With the release of "Unfaithful," it might get a little harder for
Lane to maintain such a balanced existence. The film vividly shows
the destruction of an all-American family by the adulterous actions
of the near-perfect housewife. The sexual nature and intense
love-making scenes between Lane and Martinez will certainly leave
audiences talking.</TE>
<TE>   But Lane thinks the movie portrays a valid lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that in life, affairs have no justification, and that's
what I found refreshing about the concept of this film. Usually,
philandering is the male domain, and for a woman to do it, she'd
better have a checklist of excuses in most screenplays," Lane says.
"But it doesn't work that way in real life, and this film shows that.
People harm their own lives by this type of rash behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "When people hear about a girlfriend of theirs cheating, they're
amazed by it, but at the same time, life is filled with things that
you couldn't possibly expect. You find yourself doing things that are
against how you perceive yourself. It's like letting your inner child
rule your life. And with that, there are consequences."</TE>

<LD>Where have you been ... living in a bubble? Or don't you really know
anything about the real Hollywood ("The Unusual Suspects," by Jon
Burlingame, May 5)?</LD>
<LD>   You've only scratched the tip of the iceberg! What do all the
actors you mentioned in your article have in common? None of them are
beautiful or handsome.</LD>
<LD>   They are all supporting actors. Hollywood labels them character
actors so as not to hurt their feelings.</LD>
<TE>   There are a plethora of great-looking actors who are great actors,
but they don't get the chance to play the supporting "character"
roles because the producers and the directors don't want to take
anything away from the leads (stars).</TE>
<TE>   I represent a client who has played one "character role" with
Kathy Bates and Lou Gossett Jr., and he stole the show ("Curse of the
Starving Class").</TE>
<TE>   He's a great actor ... but he's great-looking too. So he doesn't
get too many opportunities to shine in these supporting roles you're
spouting off about. He's been here for 15 years and only met 5% of
the casting directors in town. But he's worked for most of those
casting directors again and again because he's a damn good actor.
Hollywood's fickle ... and you're just making it worse.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was impressed by "What the Riots Sparked" (by Christopher Reynolds,
April 28) but disappointed that The Times failed to mention the "What
Happens to a Dream Deferred?" mural at Venice High School.</LD>
<LD>   I am writing as an artist-coordinator of a long-term project, and
as an educator and advocate for the 30-plus youth from five L.A high
schools who designed and painted this diptych mural on the west side
of the far west building at Venice High School. No amount of
apologies will cover up the fact that Mr. Reynolds and the editors at
Calendar did not do their homework thoroughly. I am pleased that you
gave credit to a recognized artist like Noni Olabisi. I am also
pleased that Robbie Conal's posters were mentioned. But he has not
been ignored in media coverage.</LD>
<LD>   The youths who have made an earnest and commendable effort to
express their views and your readers missed out by not having a
picture of this outstanding mural in this issue. It took more than
two years to design and paint and thousands of hours of labor with an
average of 30 to 35 students.</LD>
<TE>   It is on the L.A Mural Conservancy list of political murals (for
its organized bus tours), and it is one of only two murals in L.A
(with Olabisi's "Freedom Won't Wait") that deal with the issue of the
'92 uprising. You can see a good shot of both in Robin Dunitz's mural
book "Painting the Towns."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, I guess that we, the militant artists and young
creators, can wait another 10 years (the next "anniversary" of the
'92 riots?) to be recognized for our dedicated research and
self-expression, not to mention hard work.</TE>

<LD>While I was thrilled to see two articles on "Blue Crush," the movie I
spent 21/2 years writing, I was also appalled that neither article
mentioned the names of the screenwriters. In "She's Gotta Surf It"
(by Chris Petrikin, May 5), everyone from the water safety team to
the stunt doubles was discussed, but not the people who created the
characters, shaped the story and crafted the dialogue of the film.</LD>
<LD>   How ironic that the other article in which "Blue Crush" was
featured ("A Chick Flick by Any Other Name," by Rachel Abramowitz,
May 5) was about movies that empower women. But not once did she
mention the chick who co-wrote this flick.</LD>

<LD>Dean Paulos' April 28 letter about Yes, the most talented rock band
on the planet, was a welcome surprise. It amazes me that after all
the incredible music that these guys produced, they are quite often
dismissed among music historians and current writers. Even today, to
see a Yes show live is something quite amazing, unique and undeniably
worth promoting.</LD>

<LD>Due to my normal libertarian bent, Nicolai Ouroussoff and I would
likely settle on agreeing to disagree regarding property owners'
rights ("There Goes Our History," April 28). However, I'd like to
extend a heartfelt thank-you to the city of Los Angeles for limiting
to two the number of cultural heritage "police" that it employs.</LD>
<LD>   New York City is currently facing a massive budget deficit. I can
only suggest that Mayor Bloomberg consider the 50-person staff of the
Landmarks Commission as an excellent example of waste that can be
cut. I would ask Ouroussoff to consider what any homeless shelter in
New York could do with that bureaucracy's budget.</LD>
<LD>   I realize I am not one of the "cultural elite," but if I had a
home for sale that Ouroussoff wanted to save for the city's "historic
appreciation," I'd hope that he and his enlightened brethren would
swoop in to purchase it at fair market value. I think it would be
great. However, if someone wanted to bulldoze it, I truly hope our
tax dollars would be spent feeding hungry mouths, here and abroad,
rather than paying a bloated bureaucracy to prevent destruction of
personal property by the owner.</LD>
<TE>   One recommendation: I'd encourage Ouroussoff to start a nonprofit
organization dedicated to purchasing these homes. The Nature
Conservancy (of which I am proud to be a member) does a fantastic job
of doing similar work for nature habitats.</TE>
<TE>   Using taxpayer money to enforce the taste of Ouroussoff's cultural
elite on "average homeowners" is one of the most reprehensible ideas
I have heard in quite some time.</TE>
<TE>   Again, thank you Los Angeles for underfunding the Cultural
Heritage Commission.</TE>

<TE>   It took me many years to realize and truly appreciate the lasting
value of architecture. I look at it this way: Of all the things that
pass through life--people, friends, relatives, cultural attractions,
etc.--one of the few that can endure are buildings and homes. They
serve to preserve a lasting sense of place and to connect us to our
past.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, as Ouroussoff wrote, "they are the physical expression of
the city's highest ideals."</TE>
<TE>   Destructions of the Schindler and Neutra houses were acts of
cultural homicide. I am saddened and appalled.</TE>

<LD>Reader Diane Berk considers herself one of the "lucky few" who saw
the original 1981 Broadway production of "Merrily We Roll Along"
(Letters, May 5), but I was there too and I didn't feel so lucky. The
backward story line must have seemed awfully clever on paper, but it
just didn't work on stage. The show flopped--quite deservedly.</LD>
<LD>   Revisionist theater historians have now decreed that the show is a
neglected masterpiece, as if the original audiences were incapable of
appreciating its greatness. Let's get past the phony legend and face
the facts: Stephen Sondheim is a great American composer, but he
drove off the road with "Merrily We Roll Along."</LD>

<DH>What does an expansion-minded New York landmark do when it
has to close for three years? Relocate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York--Day after day, rain or shine, dozens--sometimes
hundreds--of the faithful stand in line outside the Museum of Modern
Art. Never mind that a new exhibition hasn't opened for three months,
or that the special attraction at the moment is a retrospective of
paintings by German artist Gerhard Richter, whose name is hardly a
household word. This is the world's foremost museum of modern and
contemporary art--and people have to see it. So they wait--chatting,
reading newspapers or checking out merchandise in the windows of the
museum bookstore as they shuffle along East 53rd Street. Now and
then, someone bolts across the street, grabs a fresh crepe or canned
soda from a sidewalk stand, then slips back into the line.</LD>
<TE>   But the ritual is coming to an end. On May 21 at 5 p.m., the
73-year-old museum will close its doors for three years. Fulfilling a
long-term, $800-million expansion plan, a new landmark will rise on
MoMA's historic site. Designed by Japanese architect Yoshio
Taniguchi, the 630,000-square-foot structure will incorporate
elements of the existing building while nearly doubling in size. When
the museum reopens in 2005, it will have a new seven-story gallery
tower, an education and research center, a soaring atrium and a
dramatic lobby with a view of the restored Abby Aldrich Rockefeller
Sculpture Garden. The original 53rd Street entrance will be retained,
but visitors can also enter through new doors on 54th Street.</TE>
<TE>   What to do in the meantime?</TE>
<TE>   Move and carry on.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to go out of business for three years," said Glenn
D. Lowry, director of the museum. "On a purely tactical level, we
have a lot of great shows that we want to do, and I am not prepared
to cede the ground to anyone else. To keep a staff focused and upbeat
and committed, you have to give them opportunities to do what they
do.</TE>
<TE>   "On a strategic level, this is an incredibly competitive
environment in New York," he said. "While MoMA's audience is strong
and the institution's identity is clear, being out of the spotlight
and the public gaze for three years is a very long time to allow
other institutions to erode your audience. That would be a very
foolish thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   But where does a museum with 600 employees and a 100,000-piece
collection go while awaiting its grand new home?</TE>
<TE>   To a former Swingline staple factory. In Queens.</TE>
<TE>   The monumental move is already well underway. Even as MoMA
visitors peer through windows at construction in the sculpture garden
and the adjacent area, where the Dorset Hotel once stood, or peruse a
model and a video of the new building in the lobby, trucks pull up at
the loading docks and transport art to Queens. On June 29, only six
weeks after the building on East 53rd Street closes, a temporary
exhibition program will open at MoMA QNS, the official name of the
facility in Long Island City, in the borough of Queens.</TE>
<TE>   But that's merely the public face of the momentous project. Behind
the scenes, the museum's administrators, curators, conservators,
registrars and art handlers are engaged in a team effort to close
down the old facility and open the new one. The bulk of that effort
concerns the museum's major asset: the art collection. From landmark
paintings such as Vincent van Gogh's "The Starry Night" and Pablo
Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" to contemporary German artist
Andreas Gursky's massive color photograph "Times Square, New York,"
every last painting, sculpture, drawing, print, photograph,
architectural model and design object must be carefully packed and
moved.</TE>
<TE>   "We started moving art at the end of March," said Jennifer
Russell, deputy director for exhibitions and collections support,
"and we have to have everything out of the building by Labor Day.
It's an amazing process."</TE>
<TE>   The key to success is a sheaf of charts tracking the move week by
week. Seated at a small table in her office on the museum's sixth
floor, Russell reached over to her desk, plucked a stapled pack of
papers from the top of a pile and flipped through the pages. "It's
color-coded by department," she said. "Solid lines mean packing,
dotted lines mean moving, crosses mean unpacking."</TE>
<TE>   One major challenge was to coordinate all the separate components
of the move, she said. Works on paper are packed by an outside firm,
Fine Arts Express, and moved from one loading dock; painting and
sculpture, packed by the staff, leave from the other dock. The six
curatorial departments must proceed "in a certain order to get the
collection out of the building," Russell said. "We couldn't move
prints and drawings until the architecture and design collection was
out because we had to go through that space to get to the freight
elevator."</TE>
<TE>   The trucks, which are precisely scheduled, have air-conditioning
and high-performance shock absorbers. "One of the problems is that in
order for climate control to work in a truck, the engine has to be
running," Russell said. "Having those engines running while the
trucks are being loaded really irritates our neighbors, but there's
nothing we can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   What goes into those trucks has been carefully prepared for the
journey to Queens. Paintings with ornate frames are protected by
sturdy wood travel frames. Like many other objects, they are encased
in Coro-plast, an acid-free plastic sheeting that looks like
corrugated milk glass. Strong but lightweight, rigid but easy to cut
with a box knife, it provides protection without hiding the contents,
said Pete Omlor, manager of art handling and preparation. Mylar
windows are set into plastic cases holding particularly fragile
objects that require close observation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy wood crates, like those used to transport art on airlines,
are not needed for the short truck trip to Queens in most cases, but
everything gets individual attention. Before packing, the condition
of each piece is reviewed by a conservator, who advises about
suitable packing materials. Small objects are individually wrapped,
then grouped together in cardboard boxes. Paper attached to the boxes
list works by artist name, title and acquisition number.</TE>
<TE>   The whereabouts of each work is tracked on a computer throughout
the move, said Ramona Bannayan, director of collections management
and exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   For security reasons, museum officials won't reveal the trucks'
routes. "We have actually planned the loading of the trucks and their
contents until the end, and communications are down to military
precision," Bannayan said. "We did so much planning and preparation
in advance that it really has gone very smoothly."</TE>
<TE>   Although first-time and casual visitors probably don't know what
they are missing, the museum's exhibition space has shrunk during the
past year. The museum's west and north wings, which housed the
education center and galleries for architecture, design, photography,
prints and illustrated books, along with stored collections, have
already been demolished.</TE>
<TE>   In Omlor's rudimentary ground-floor office, the phone rings
continually and his colleagues frequently stop by to ask quick
questions, but everything appears to be under control. All is
calm--if only for the moment--in the adjacent warehouse-like space
where artworks await transport to Queens. Securely packed paintings
stand on racks or lean against walls. Boxes of smaller works are
arranged in neat rows.</TE>
<TE>   Five floors above all this activity, Lowry sits in his quiet
office, next to a rectangular coffee table covered with short stacks
of books. Among them is a slim but lavishly produced silver and red
volume, "MoMA Builds," designed to explain the project to patrons and
to solicit their financial support. In a pocket on the back cover of
the book is a list of "naming opportunities"--from $25 million for
the grand lobby to $5,000 for a seat in the museum's auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on the massive construction and fund-raising project,
Lowry said it is the product of an overarching vision of the museum
and its future. Both the expansion and the move to Queens began with
discussions about "where we saw ourselves 25 years from now and what
we assumed our attendance, collections and agenda would look like,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although MoMA's leading position in modern art is widely accepted,
its dedication to contemporary art has been questioned. Lowry rejects
that. "We have built over the last 10 or 15 years probably the
preeminent collection of contemporary art as well. We just haven't
had space to show it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important decision we made was an absolute commitment to
continuing the growth of our collection into the present," continued
Lowry, who took charge of MoMA in 1995. "While we were exceptionally
strong in the late 19th century right through the 1960s, we wanted to
have a collection that moved into the 21st century. That meant we
needed space to show different kinds of objects than we have
traditionally shown. Large Richard Serra sculptures, for instance,
can't be shown in this building because we don't have ceilings that
are high enough or floors that can bear the weight."</TE>
<TE>   The galleries with older works in the collection are also
restrictive, he said. "They are configured in a long, narrow axis
that conforms to the shape of the building, so we tell our story in a
sequence of chapters. Visitors march through history in a very linear
way, but modern art wasn't created that way. Our new footprint is
much more of a large square, so the galleries intersect, and you can
narrate the story in two or three dimensions. You can see that while
Abstract Expressionism was unfolding, there were counter movements
that were equally important. The real issue for us wasn't so much the
need for more space, but the need for different kinds of space that
allow us to inflect and complicate our program."</TE>
<TE>   The museum also had a storage problem, with large portions of its
collection stashed in 12 rented facilities scattered all over town. A
search for space that would accommodate consolidated storage led to
the purchase of the 160,000-square-foot Swingline industrial building
in Queens. The museum then contracted with Cooper, Robertson &amp;
Partners, a New York architecture and urban design firm, to analyze
the museum's storage needs and transform the former staple factory
into a state-of-the-art storage and study facility.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Taniguchi won a 1997 competition to design the new
building in Manhattan, and the expansion project took off.</TE>
<TE>   "It became clear that we were going to have to close down at some
point," Russell said. "So the question became, what were we going to
do about a public presence? We looked in Manhattan, but it didn't
make sense to lease space that we would have to climatize and equip
with security systems when we were already doing that in the building
in Queens. So we switched gears and began developing an interim plan
and a final plan for that building. The interim plan provides for
exhibition space as well as storage space. In the final plan, we may
retain some sort of public presence, but the building will be
primarily storage."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Los Angeles architect Michael Maltzan was commissioned to
design the public part of the building: a 12,500-square-foot lobby, a
20,000-square-foot mezzanine and a 25,000-square-foot exhibition
space. The challenge, he said, was to design a temporary home for a
museum that has become "a canonical institution in our cultural
framework" in a context that is entirely different from its historic
site.</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan said he didn't want to do "a gussied-up building in a
gritty neighborhood." Neither did he want to simply interpret the
notion of a temporary space in terms of materials and construction
techniques. Instead, he made a conceptual shift. "The idea of
temporary grew into the idea of temporal," he said. "It's about
movement and change, and you as a participant in that."</TE>
<TE>   Visitors who arrive by the No. 7 subway, which goes above ground
in Long Island City, see "MoMA" "appear" in big block letters on the
roof of the bright blue, rectangular building. Portions of the
letters are painted in white on black boxes that cover
air-conditioning systems and other equipment. At a certain point on
the train ride, the partial letters converge into the museum's
acronym.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors enter the building through glass doors etched with
"MoMA," and walk up a few stairs onto a ramp. It sweeps past a
coat-check counter, up to a cafe and ticket counter, then around to
the galleries. Maltzan said he designed "a continuous threshold"
leading visitors through a variety of spaces.</TE>
<TE>   One of three inaugural shows, "Tempo," will reflect Maltzan's
architectural theme in contemporary artworks that incorporate various
aspects of time--real, imaginary, biological, symbolic and historic.
The other two, "To Be Looked At: Selections From the Painting and
Sculpture Collection" and "AUTObodies: speed, sport, transport," will
be drawn from the museum's holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Moving out of the old building and into the new one would have
been challenging under any circumstances. Accomplishing that feat
while maintaining most public operations and running a nearly
continuous exhibition program has been particularly taxing. Some
things have been put on hold, including the search for a successor to
Kirk Varnedoe, the former chief curator of painting and sculpture,
who resigned last year and joined the faculty at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The search is in a rudimentary stage, and that's where it will
stay until the opening of MoMA QNS, Lowry said. "There is too much
going on now to concentrate on that."</TE>
<TE>   As to art world speculation about whether the new curator will be
drawn from academia, as in the past, or from curatorial ranks, Lowry
said that discussion is pointless. "What the position requires is
someone who is an outstanding scholar and a brilliant curator who is
comfortable working in a large institution that has six other
curatorial departments and a tremendous expectation of performance,"
he said. "Whether that person is currently in a museum or a
university or someplace else makes no difference to me."</TE>
<TE>   There's no hurry, he said. "Kynaston McShine, a senior curator
here, is the acting chief curator and he's doing a terrific job. I'd
rather wait and get the right person than rush and get the wrong
person."</TE>
<TE>   It's full steam ahead with the move, however, as the staff carries
out its carefully laid plans. "We have to stay on top of things and
get them done," Lowry said. "That means focusing on details, so
things don't slip away."</TE>
<TE>   But with time tables in hand and much of the art already in
Queens, some staff members are looking ahead. Said Bannayan of
collections management: "We are finally in the part of the process
where not only are we seeing light at the end of the tunnel, it's an
amazingly beautiful light."</TE>

<LD>The $2-million romantic comedy "Cherish" from Fine Line Features
doesn't have a big-studio summer movie marketing budget, and Marian
Koltai-Levine hasn't had the six months her big-studio counterparts
have to plot its release.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Koltai-Levine, Fine Line's executive vice president of
marketing, "seeded" the specialty market: She screened the film
extensively for magazines with a two- or three-month lead time and
booked "Cherish" into regional film festivals like San Francisco and
Seattle, aiming for a movie fan audience that would start positive
word-of-mouth.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the film's 1980s setting, Koltai-Levine planned promo
screenings with radio stations and dance clubs around the country, to
simultaneously encourage more word-of-mouth and the playing of the
film's soundtrack (to be released on New Line Records). There were
"teaser" ads in college newspapers, timed for before the end of the
semester but still close enough to the release date to be fresh in
students' minds.</LD>
<TE>   Right before "Cherish" opens next month in New York and Los
Angeles, and later in other major cities, Koltai-Levine will send the
film's stars, Robin Tunney and Tim Blake Nelson, across the country
to appear on film festival panels and be interviewed by local
television and print media. Then, if the film breaks through and goes
into multiple urban and suburban runs, Fine Line will bolster the
expansion with a flash of cable TV commercials.</TE>
<TE>   In what's been called a franchise summer for moviegoers--another
"Star Wars" installment, sequels to "Men in Black" and "Austin
Powers," for example--it's easy to overlook the fact that there is an
eager audience for independent movies such as "Cherish." But there
will be plenty of such films, more than 30, released during the
season. The reason is the same as for the major studios.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a block of about 10 weeks in summer that can't be beat,"
says Jeff Lipsky, president of Lot 47 Films, which is releasing two
digitally shot films: "Some Body" and "The Fast Runner." "College
students are out of school, working people are on vacation, everyone
has more leisure time."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to higher-profile breakout releases like last year's
"The Others" and 1999's "The Blair Witch Project," smaller companies
have had consistent success with specialized fare in summer, going
back to the early '80s with "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and more
recently with films such as "An Ideal Husband," "Trainspotting," "The
Opposite of Sex," "The Deep End," "Sexy Beast" and even
foreign-language movies such as "The Red Violin" and "The Closet."</TE>
<TE>   According to box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations, in the
past five years, non-studio movies have regularly chalked up between
7% and 10% of overall ticket sales, achieving the top end with
blockbuster titles like "Blair Witch" or "The Others" that are
released in more than 1,000 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do these films fill a gap for an upscale adult audience,
says Michael Barker, a principal in Sony Pictures Classics, "but the
critics are starved as well. That's why it's always been a good time
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Because they are not competing with the studios' meatier
Oscar-caliber films, which are primarily crammed into the last six
weeks of every calendar year, summer independent releases have
consistently been able to stand out with reviewers and linger in the
memory long enough to garner mention on 10-best lists at the end of
the year ("Buena Vista Social Club," "The Deep End," "Hedwig and the
Angry Inch") as well as Oscar attention ("The Full Monty," "Sexy
Beast," "Spider Woman").</TE>
<TE>   The combination of critical and box-office success also has
begotten greater interest from star names eager to give themselves
over to material that doesn't require special-effects acrobatics.
This year some of Hollywood's biggest names will be appearing in
"small" movies: Julia Roberts in Steven Soderbergh's eagerly awaited
ensemble comedy "Full Frontal"; Robin Williams in "One Hour Photo";
Jodie Foster in "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"; and Gwyneth
Paltrow in "Possession."</TE>
<TE>   Independent distributors say they don't fret much about what
studios are doing in summer, since those movies are mostly aimed at
teenagers and the family audience. The rare exceptions include the
erotically charged "Unfaithful" and the Tom Hanks drama "Road to
Perdition."</TE>
<TE>   "The behemoths have nothing to do with us," says Mark Urman, head
of distribution at Think Films. "We're the underdogs 52 weeks a year.
The trick in summer is not to compete with ourselves." He points to
the recent simultaneous release of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and
"Enigma," which did stronger business than anticipated, knocking "The
Cat's Meow" out of its prime New York theater after only two weeks.
It's not that "The Cat's Meow" wasn't doing well; the other films
just did better.</TE>
<TE>   Because the small cadre of top theaters for independent films is
in constant demand, distributors juggle their schedules to jump in
when a film fails or drop back when a surprise hit emerges. That kind
of flexibility requires long-range planning, since independent movies
are only intermittently advertised on television (and then it's
primarily on specialty cable channels like Bravo or A&amp;E), according
to Koltai-Levine of Fine Line.</TE>
<TE>   "It requires a lot of patience and preparation," she says.
"Cherish" debuted at Sundance in January and will open in theaters on
June 7. Once it opens in major cities, "we have a two-week window of
opportunity," she says. If the film hits, it can expand throughout
the summer like Fine Line's summer hit last year, "The Anniversary
Party."</TE>
<TE>   The advantage of having high-profile performers in independent
movies, according to Barker, is the ability to command attention from
the mainstream megaplexes in some areas, in addition to the specialty
chains. By Memorial Day, he hopes to be playing "13 Conversations
About One Thing" (with Matthew McConaughey) next door to the new
"Star Wars." If audiences connect with John Sayles' "Sunshine State"
(starring Angela Bassett and Timothy Hutton), opening in late June,
it could attract viewers in major cities who can't get into "Men in
Black II" over the Fourth of July weekend or prefer somewhat more
challenging fare.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the major studio movies, opening-weekend grosses for most
specialized-audience films are not as important as the second and
third weekends, which demonstrate whether the movie is catching on
through word-of-mouth and has the ability to broaden outside of New
York and Los Angeles to other major cities. The lucky ones, the
"crossover" films, can gross $5 million, the indie benchmark of
success (comparable to $75 million to $100 million for a studio
film), because those movies cost about a tenth as much as the average
studio film (including marketing) and rarely play in more than 100 to
200 theaters. "The specialty films that do [well] in summer now have
the chance of doing even better because there are more theaters
willing to play these movies," says Mark Gill, West Coast president
of Miramax Films.</TE>
<TE>   Besides having the right star or name director, a fresh or
alternative concept can be a key ingredient in reaching that goal.
Because the major studios labor to create movies that are repeatable
or fodder for spinoffs, the playing field for independent movies is
wider.</TE>
<TE>   There will be, to be sure, the regular spate of serious dramas
like the Sundance prize-winner "The Believer," about a Jewish
neo-Nazi youth; the ensemble dramas "Sunshine State" and "The Safety
of Objects," starring Glenn Close; the stylistically daring "Gangster
No. 1"; and "One Hour Photo," starring Robin Williams as an
unbalanced photo developer.</TE>
<TE>   Stylish period pieces like "An Ideal Husband" have worked well in
the past and there will be more this summer. In addition to "The
Importance of Being Earnest," there's an adaptation of A.S. Byatt's
novel "Possession," which offers parallel romances in the 19th and
20th centuries, and the Napoleonic-era comedy "The Emperor's New
Clothes," starring Ian Holm.</TE>
<TE>   While most studio summer movies are aimed squarely at the male
audience, the independent world is offering films with strong female
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax is releasing not just sophisticated period pieces like
"Earnest," but also "Tadpole," a comedy about a young man with a
taste for older women--"the kinds of movies my mother or my wife
would want to see," Gill says.</TE>
<TE>   Because the studios are offering little in the way of romance this
summer, the indies are jumping into the breach with films such as
"Lovely &amp; Amazing," starring Catherine Keener and Brenda Blethyn, and
more dramatic romances like Miguel Arteta's "The Good Girl," starring
Jennifer Aniston. Other female-skewing titles include the British
film "Me Without You," about a 30-year friendship between two women.</TE>
<TE>   As with "Cherish," the romantic comedy "Pumpkin," starring
Christina Ricci, hopes to attract younger women. And there will be
several other movies that could lure the younger generation away from
a steady diet of "Scooby-Doo" and "Austin Powers" and toward somewhat
meatier fare. There's director Roman Coppola's drama "CQ"; and for
those prone to punk-rock nostalgia, "24 Hour Party People"; and the
comedy-drama "Igby Goes Down," with Claire Danes, Amanda Peet and
Kieran Culkin. There's even a family film, "Little Secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign films have been enjoying a renaissance lately with such
recent hits as "Amelie," "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and "Monsoon Wedding,"
which have been slowly eroding the barrier against subtitled movies,
and not just among aging baby boomers. Encouraged by the breakout
summer performance of "Run Lola Run" in 1999, independents will offer
such movies as Paramount Classics' German import "Mostly Martha,"
about a fastidious chef who is softened by romance. The hope is that
the films can tap the same viewers who found "Chocolat" and
"Babette's Feast" appetizing. The epic Indian film "Lagaan," an Oscar
nominee that was released earlier this month, carries hopes of
building momentum as the summer progresses. Later on, the French
comedy "My Wife Is an Actress" will be released.</TE>
<TE>   As in any summer, only the strongest eight to 10 films will
survive the indie competitive heat. But they're likely to be movies
that are talked about long after the latest studio franchise film has
evanesced.</TE>

<HD>The Audition That Launched a Career</HD>
<DH>Finnish pianist Paavali Jumppanen had the training, but it
took an American program--a cross between competition and tryouts--to
open international doors.</DH>

<LD>It's a scene easy to visualize. Two boys are trying to take piano
lessons while their younger brother makes a pest of himself. The
irony is that the kid brother will grow up to be the professional
pianist. The others will become a chemist and a software programmer.</LD>
<LD>   But another irony is at work here. Although Finland gave the kid
brother--Paavali Jumppanen, who makes his California debut today at
UCLA's Schoenberg Hall--an extensive music education, it was an
American organization that is giving him an international career.</LD>
<LD>   Those doors opened for him after he won the 2000 Young Concert
Artists International Auditions. The New York-based
organization--which distinguishes itself from typical
competitions--focuses exclusively on managing the careers of
up-and-coming artists. Alums include pianists Emanuel Ax, Murray
Perahia, and Jean-Yves Thibaudet, violinist Pinchas Zukerman, soprano
Dawn Upshaw and the Tokyo String Quartet.</LD>
<TE>   "The auditions are a link for us to the real music world,"
Jumppanen, 27, said in a recent phone interview from Boston, where he
was stopping before his Southland date. "You immediately get
concerts, which is what this is all about. In competitions, some do a
real fine job of taking care of people afterward. But some are more
interested in just the event itself, which is also fine. YCA is a
mechanism that leads to immediate results. To us, that is the most
wonderful asset."</TE>
<TE>   The results are no accident. The nonprofit organization was
founded in 1961 to provide bookings, publicity and career guidance
until an artist is signed by commercial agencies, typically within
three to five years.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of our auditions is to find exceptional talent,"
founder Susan Wadsworth said. "We don't just have a piano
competition. We hear all instruments, as well as voices, string
quartets and trios. What we're looking for is people or a group who,
given the opportunity, actually have all the stuff necessary to have
a viable career for the rest of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Every finalist gets a $5,000 "first prize" award. Semi-finalists
get a $1,000 second prize.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels better in the outside world to say 'first prize,'"
Wadsworth explains. "At the Paris Conservatory, you have to win first
prize to graduate. Everyone who graduates gets first prize. If they
can do it, we can too."</TE>
<TE>   Wadsworth isn't against other kinds of competitions, but she sees
them as only a small part of the equation. "I encourage our artists
to enter competitions if they want to," she said. "It's very
stimulating. They have to learn certain repertoire. Being competitive
is actually part of having a career. You have to have that desire to
excel.</TE>
<TE>   "But winning a competition sometimes just means they take the
money and some engagements and that's the end of it and nobody makes
anything of them."</TE>
<TE>   Wadsworth happened into management. She studied violin and piano
at the Mannes College of Music in New York but decided against trying
for a concert career. She took a job at the United Nations and
started thinking about a way to spotlight her Mannes colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it might be a great idea to present a concert series
with these people who I knew were extraordinary," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The series--which took place at nights at a restaurant in
Greenwich Village that would otherwise have been closed--included
many artists who went on to major careers: violist Jesse Levine (now
head of the string department at Yale) and pianist Richard Goode, for
example, from the Mannes group. Wadsworth also booked solo flutist
Paula Robison, pianist Ilana Vered and violinist Shmuel Ashkenasi,
who founded and leads the Vermeer Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked for contributions and started a nonprofit organization.
It all seemed to click. Then I realized that this was not nearly
enough to do for artists. Little by little, I just kept adding more
and more things."</TE>
<TE>   The formal YCA Auditions began in 1965. "Now we're just a staff of
14," Wadsworth says, "all working our heads off, trying to keep up
with everything we're doing to help promote these young, fabulous
artists."</TE>
<TE>   The program holds preliminary auditions in New York, although for
the last seven years, they've also taken place in Leipzig, Germany,
to make it easier for young musicians from eastern Europe to be heard
live. (In October, auditions will also be held in Paris.) Musicians
who live too far from these cities can audition by tape.</TE>
<TE>   YCA pays for those winners, about 50 musicians, to go to New York
for the next round. Typically, about 12 to 14 first prizes are given
out. The age range is 16 to 26 for instrumentalists, 20 to 28 for
singers.</TE>
<TE>   The annual budget has grown to about $1.7 million. About $1.4
million of that supports the artists through direct fees, publicity
materials and managing services. Funds come from individual sponsors,
foundations, corporations and grants.</TE>
<TE>   Not every audition winner winds up with commercial management,
however. "There's a plethora of brilliant young musicians emerging
these days, and the managements already have large rosters of
artists. It's very hard to move them on," Wadsworth said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we have to just push them out of the nest if they have
been here quite awhile and we feel we've done everything we can. Just
finding themselves on their own often leads to something."</TE>
<TE>   Jumppanen agrees that sometimes "you have to swim for yourself."
He sees himself as a rugged, individualist Finn, and he's not upset
by that proposition.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been under [the control of] some bigger country," he
said. "But it's always been at too far a distance to go ask how we
should handle things. This independence is very much a good thing,
even a little part in the psyche of a Finnish artist."</TE>
<TE>   He had shown that independence even as a child when he began
pestering his brothers during their lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "My brothers had this charismatic teacher, who had this very
emotional connection with music," Jumppanen recalled. "He was just an
exciting guy who came to our house to sing and yell at my brothers
for not practicing. I was always around, even when I was very little.
The whole atmosphere was capturing. That's why I started."</TE>
<TE>   Once captured by the piano, Jumppanen's native talent emerged,
aided by Finland's extensive government-funded music programs, which
nurture gifted youngsters from childhood to the Sibelius Academy in
Helsinki.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to go to night school so I would have more time to
practice. My whole high school was in night school."</TE>
<TE>   He first earned major recognition after winning the top prize in
the Finnish national Maj Lind Competition when he was 19.</TE>
<TE>   But he stepped back to complete his academic studies.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt I had to go back to school," he said. "I played a little
bit, but I wanted to make my education secure. I studied for three
years. The next award was the YCA one. It came as a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Since his win, YCA has booked 36 concerts in the United States for
him. Boston Globe critic Richard Dyer called his technique "big and
his imaginative daring even bigger." New York Times critic Paul
Griffiths wrote, "He performs with immense power and drive. He
commands an extraordinary range of colors. His programming too
suggests thoughtfulness and passion--and independence."</TE>
<TE>   Jumppanen cites YCA's logistical support as important for getting
such good notices. "In preparing for a concert, they've arranged
everything around it," he said, "dealing with the kind of details
that have to be done in order to have the maximum energy and
inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   As for commercial representation, "professional management is
something that comes when the time is right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, Jumppanen's program will range from the classical
perfection of Mozart to the thundering virtuosity of Rachmaninoff,
with Tchaikovsky in between. "I like to have a variety of styles
within the same program," the young pianist said. "I like to have
contrasts that sometimes complement each other and sometimes are just
cutting and don't have anything in common.</TE>
<TE>   "What I hope comes across: I only play the kinds of pieces that
I'm really fascinated about that moment," he continued.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to feel that I want to try this piece or style for a
while, then go as deep as possible. Of course, you can't go to the
bottom. I want to change myself with every piece so that it doesn't
become an egotistic piece or a piece that [merely] suits me. It must
fascinate me and change my life. I would like to have something of
that come across."</TE>

<LD>   Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen, right, with Natalie Portman)
is a Jedi whose fate is bound to Queen Amidala's in "Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones," George Lucas' fifth entry in his
space opus. Ewan McGregor co-stars. Opens Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Also: The directing Weitz brothers of "American Pie" fame take on
the bard of arrested male development. They adapt Nick Hornby's novel
"About a Boy," starring Hugh Grant as a feckless playboy who bonds
with a misfit 12-year-old. With Rachel Weisz and Toni Collette. Opens
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Theater</TE>
<TE>   The Broadway musical, "A Class Act," a West Coast premiere at the
Pasadena Playhouse, pays tribute to Ed Kleban, the late Pulitzer
Prize- and Tony Award-winning lyricist of "A Chorus Line," using his
music and lyrics to tell the story of his lifelong search for
friendship, love and success. Written by Linda Kline and Lonny Price,
the musical begins as Kleban's ghost, attending his own memorial
service and not hearing the accolades he expects, sets the record
straight. Opens today.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   Written during Esa-Pekka Salonen's sabbatical from the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, his orchestral work "Foreign Bodies" receives its U.S.
premiere in three Los Angeles Philharmonic performances at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion beginning Thursday. Says the composer, who
will also conduct this week: "I very much enjoy the energy and joy of
my adopted hometown of Los Angeles. And yet I feel foreign, a
misplaced, shy northerner amidst extroverted and confident
Californians. This polarity is quite inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   Dance</TE>
<TE>   When American percussionist Keith Terry and Indonesian
choreographer I Wayan Dibia get together for Body Tjak, audiences
listen. Terry and Dibia first collaborated in 1980, and their
combination of Balinese chant, complex clapping rhythms and dancing
that involves performers in percussive accompaniment has carried them
around the world. Free performances at the Fowler Museum on the UCLA
campus Thursday and Friday will enlist students from the departments
of world arts and cultures, theater, music and ethnomusicology.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood scriptwriters would say singer Claudia Acuna, above, has
a great back story. Born in Santiago, Chile, she decides early in her
life to be a jazz singer. She moves to New York City even though she
lacks fluency in English and the money to enroll in any of that
city's many jazz education programs. But she perseveres, hanging out
at jazz clubs and supporting herself with jobs as a baby-sitter,
dog-walker and dishwasher. She is eventually signed by Verve Records
and releases two critically acclaimed albums. She opens her
six-nighter at the Jazz Bakery in Culver City on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Art</TE>
<TE>   The Art Center College of Design in Pasadena continues its series
of exhibitions exploring the intersection of art, technology and
science with "Situated Realities: Where Technology and Imagination
Intersect," opening today at the Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery.
The exhibition of computer-</TE>
<TE>   mediated imagery looks at the changing nature of representation in
the age of digital technology and will feature works by 24 artists,
including Jim Campbell, Dieter Huber and Anna Ullrich. Above: Simen

<HD>From Weezer, Exuberant 'Maladroit' Is Anything But</HD>

<LD>   WEEZER</LD>
<LD>   "Maladroit"</LD>
<TE>   Geffen</TE>
<TE>   Most bands toil and sweat to come up with an album's worth of
songs. Weezer sounds as if it has the opposite problem--stopping the
flood. "Maladroit" (in stores Tuesday) comes just a year after the
L.A. band's last album, and its tuneful music flows out with uniform
force. When it stops after 35 minutes, it's as if the band simply
decided it was time to twist the shut-off valve.</TE>
<TE>   There's none of the rise-and-fall complexity so many musicians use
to make their records seem as important as novels, none of the clean,
regimented sound that prevails in punk-derived pop. Leader Rivers
Cuomo and company wallow in a pure sonic pleasure, slopping through
their musical mud with an infectious exuberance.</TE>
<TE>   "Maladroit" is packed with clarion chording, clouds of aural
sparks, background-filling vocal refrains, spoken asides, and
call-and-response exchanges. The band's production fills the space to
near-capacity--it all seems about to explode into feedback, and even
a thump on a certain drum pulls a squeal out of the air.</TE>
<TE>   Trembling at the breaking point is where Cuomo loves to be.
Weezer's central persona, he remains the iconic outsider, and the
music serves that character well. But the emphasis in "Maladroit"
(which is enhanced with live videos of seven songs) is the sound
itself. At a time when even rock's alternative and underground heroes
often record like fastidious fussbudgets, Weezer reminds us that it's
OK to make a mess.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   **1/2</TE>
<TE>   MUSIQ</TE>
<TE>   "Juslisen"</TE>
<TE>   Def Soul</TE>
<TE>   This Philadelphia native has the neo-soul formula down. His
sophomore release recalls the laid-back-groove sensibility of
Maxwell, blending the feel of classic R&amp;B with modern hip-hop and
dance styles along with positive views of romance and
self-reflection.</TE>
<TE>   Musiq doesn't have quite the command of sprawling jams of, say,
Raphael Saadiq, but such tracks as the jazz-flecked "Time" are
carried by distinctive, almost out-of-phase percussion, while
"Onenight" blossoms from folky starkness into a lavish, gospel-esque
seduction number.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it takes more than production tricks and a quirky approach
to spelling to stand out in this genre, which is crowded with
talented artists who adeptly manipulate the style without bringing
much to the party. And they don't even have to bring much, as what
this collection really has going for it is Musiq's ability to see
women as more than unattainable objects of perfection.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he doesn't lust after them (see the funky infatuation
romp "Caughtup"). But he also convincingly expresses a love beyond
the physical in "Dontchange," while the airy "Halfcrazy" charts his
regrets over bedding a female pal and complicating the friendship.</TE>
<TE>   True, his shout-out to Mom and Dad lays on the sincerity a bit
thick. But when he offers a sad portrait of a battered woman friend
in "Realove," without positioning himself as her potential savior, it
makes "Juslisen" a thoughtful antidote to all the macho posturing out
there.</TE>

<TE>   VARIOUS ARTISTS</TE>
<TE>   "Wolfpac Records Presents</TE>
<TE>   Still More Bounce--</TE>
<TE>   A Tribute to Roger Troutman"</TE>
<TE>   Wolfpac</TE>
<TE>   The late Roger Troutman is one of the most-sampled musicians in
hip-hop. As a solo artist and the visionary behind the group Zapp,
the musician injected a distinct brand of computerized funk into
music, with his addictive clap tracks and signature talkbox (which
gave his voice a digitized sound) standing as two of his
groundbreaking trademarks.</TE>
<TE>   Like the work of James Brown and George Clinton, Troutman's music
has inspired and influenced a host of rap acts, including EPMD, the
Jungle Brothers, Dr. Dre and 2Pac. Several other artists indebted to
Troutman interpret some of his most famous selections on this
high-powered collection (due Tuesday), On the title track, Ras Kass,
Kam, Cypress Hill's B-Real and tha Liks' Tash pay homage to
Troutman's legacy and give a 2002 face-lift to "More Bounce to the
Ounce," possibly Zapp's most remarkable cut.</TE>
<TE>   The brainchild of tha Liks' J-Ro, "Still More Bounce" shows how
significant Troutman--who was fatally shot in 1999 by his brother
Larry in a murder-suicide outside their recording studio in Dayton,
Ohio--and his music were to the legion of hip-hop artists who breathe
new life into his legacy with each song, whether it's Snoop Dogg and
others on "Throw It Up" or Daz Dillinger and friends on "Party
Started."</TE>
<TE>   Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Big Tymers, "Hood Rich," Cash Money/Universal. These
bling-bling kings lost some of their luster in the last few years as
materialistic mashing was run into the ground by countless rap
artists. On the New Orleans duo's fourth album, Cash Money co-owner
Brian "Baby" Williams and producer-rapper Mannie Fresh shift gears
lyrically and sonically. Their boasts are more fun and less biting
but as appealing as ever, and Fresh replaces his signature bounce
with a number of more sedate backdrops. "Rich" indeed. S.B.</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Various artists, "Spider-Man (Music From and Inspired By),"
Columbia. Like the record-breaking movie, this soundtrack has its
share of crowd-pleasing moments. But despite a lineup that includes
Danny Elfman, Macy Gray (remixed by Rage Against the Machine's Tom
Morello), Slipknot's Corey Taylor and the Strokes, the collection
isn't nearly as bold or complex as the comic book character it's
supposed to represent --or as the diversity of the artists might
suggest. Still, selections such as "Hero," which pairs Nickelback's
Chad Kroeger and Saliva's Josey Scott, and Aerosmith's rendition of
the classic "Spider-Man" theme hint at Spidey's mystique with a
subtle touch.</TE>
<TE>   --Lina Lecaro</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2 La Vela Puerca, "De Bichos y Flores," Surco/Universal. This
exciting band from Uruguay is putting its tiny homeland on the map
with its forceful mix of ska, reggae and punk, and its witty,
penetrating Spanish lyrics. Produced by Gustavo Santaolalla and
partly recorded in his L.A. studio, this is only the second album
since the band's debut at a Montevideo street festival on Christmas
Eve 1995. Although reminiscent of Argentina's Fabulosos Cadillacs, La
Vela adds strikingly original forms, such as the intensely festive
murga "Jose Sabia," an uplifting theme propelled by carnival
drumming. Overall, an irresistible collection by a punchy band with a
strange name.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Deadsy, "Commencement," DreamWorks. People who think too
much need rock too, and this debut (due Tuesday) from the L.A.
quintet led by Elijah Blue Allman, a.k.a. P. Exeter Blue I, fits the
bill. A horror-burlesque of '80s synth-rock, death-metal guitar,
droning vocals and '70s prog-pop, "Commencement" is as theatrical as
Slipknot, albeit in a prep-school/sci-fi/trust-fund-baby kind of way.
Such muscular-yet-slick numbers as "The Key to Gramercy Park" and
"Mansion World" are innovative and fun, but eventually a bombastic
drone overwhelms.</TE>

<LD>After I wrote a story a few weeks ago about the search for new female
jazz vocalists, it was no surprise to realize that the stack of
albums by singers--both newly arriving and already on the scene--was
quickly growing larger. The most interesting aspect of this roundup
is that--even though many of the names may be unfamiliar--the quality
level is generally high and the individual styles are extraordinarily
diverse.</LD>
<LD>   Claire Martin, "The Very Best of Claire Martin" (***1/2, Linn
Records). English singer Martin burst onto the British jazz scene a
decade ago, but she has failed to achieve similar visibility in this
country. It's hard to understand why, because she has all the
attributes one could desire: a highly personal, instantly
identifiable sound; an urgent sense of swing; the enviable capacity
to remain in firm touch with the spirit of a song while embarking on
jazz variations; and, above all, flawless musical intelligence and
taste. This collection, which features selections she made from her
first seven albums (including lovely readings of "Estate" and such
offbeat items as Joni Mitchell's "Be Cool" and Cy Coleman's "Would
You Believe"), is a fine introduction to the work of this first-rate
jazz artist.</LD>
<TE>   Jackie Ryan, "Passion Flower" (***, OpenArt Records). San
Francisco-based Ryan is one of many gifted, mature artists at risk of
slipping through the cracks as record companies seek ever younger
artists. That's a shame, because Ryan, whose Mexican-Irish-French
heritage has blessed her with an abundant stylistic range, is another
world-class talent. That range is fully evident in her musically
insightful renderings of songs ranging from Antonio Carlos Jobim's
"Luiza" and Percy Mayfield's "Please Send Me Someone to Love" to Duke
Ellington's "Mood Indigo" and Carlos Almaran's "Historia de Un Amor."</TE>
<TE>   Luciana Souza, "Brazilian Duos" (***, Sunny Side Records). Souza
is a member of a second generation of Brazilian musical royalty that
also includes Bebel Gilberto, Moreno Veloso and Paulo Jobim. The
daughter of songwriters Walter Santos and Tereza Souza, she was an
accomplished recording artist by the time she was 16. For this
outing, she has chosen to frame her exquisite voice in the simplest
of settings--with solo guitar accompaniment (including Romero
Lubambo, Marco Pereira and her father). Her choice of repertoire is
equally impeccable, with her fluid contralto moving with consummate
ease through songs by Luis Gonzaga, Edu Lobo, Antonio Carlos Jobim
and, of course, her parents.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Blackstone, "Natural Habitat NYC" (**1/2, Motief Records).
Blackstone has the sound, rhythm and heart of a jazz singer. She has
surrounded herself with some first-rate accompanists (including the
veteran Sir Roland Hanna on piano) and chosen an attractive set of
material. She's at her best in rhythm tunes such as "Where You At?"
and "Nothing Like You," and she will reach the upper level of jazz
vocalizing when she more firmly masters her pitch placement and
emphasizes the warmer, rather than the edgier, qualities of her
sound.</TE>
<TE>   Rachelle Ferrell, "Live in Montreux 91-97" (**1/2, Blue Note). Two
sets of performances, recorded in 1991, shortly after Ferrell arrived
on the scene, and in 1997, display both the appealing and the
bothersome aspects of her remarkable talent. Ferrell is the Sarah
Vaughan of contemporary jazz singing--blessed with amazing vocal
skills, a near perfect ear for harmony and an ineffable ability to
swing. But too often her interpretations are about virtuosity rather
than communication, about technique rather than message. A pair of
songs from the 1991 performance--"My Funny Valentine" and
"Blackbird"--and two French-language numbers from the 1997 tribute to
Charles Aznavour display how nuanced she can be when she places her
skills at the service of the song, rather than vice versa. But too
often her remarkable abilities are dissipated in over-the-top
theatrics.</TE>
<TE>   Grazyna Auguscik, "River" (**1/2, GMA Records). Well, yes, the
name is definitely difficult. Born in Poland, residing in Chicago
since 1992 (after attending Berklee College in Boston), Auguscik
pronounces her name Gra-je-na Aw-goose-chick. Her singing, however,
is considerably easier to grasp, since she is firmly rooted in the
free-flying arena of contemporary vocal jazz. Her material ranges
from tunes by Kenny Garrett, Egberto Gismonti and Terry Callier to
the Jimmy Webb ballad "The Moon's a Harsh Mistress" and Villa-Lobos'
"Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5." Add to that some Auguscik originals
and interpretations that make stunning use of her lithe, mobile
voice, and the result is a singer to be watched. Although her
cutting-edge musical manner may not be to every taste, she--like a
number of regional artists--is doing important work in advancing the
potential for imaginative jazz singing.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Hubka, "You Inspire Me" (**, VSOJAZZ Records). Hubka, like
Souza, has recorded an album in which she is prominently accompanied
by guitarists (including Gene Bertoncini, Bucky Pizzarelli and
Lubambo, among others). In this case, however, the instrumentation is
occasionally enhanced by bass and drums, providing a felicitous
setting for Hubka's cool-toned vocals. Following a current trend
among jazz vocalists, she has expanded her repertoire, balancing
familiar numbers such as "Blue Moon" and "Wave" with less frequently
heard tunes--Hoagy Carmichael's "Winter Moon," Blossom Dearie's
"Inside a Silent Tear," and Mancini and Mercer's "Moment to Moment."
But Hubka's renderings are not nearly as emotionally layered as her
choice of material, and she needs to balance her otherwise attractive
musical instincts with a more penetrating look into the heart of her
songs.</TE>
<TE>   Flora Purim, "Sings Milton Nascimento" (**, Narada Jazz). Purim's
early work with her husband, Airto Moreira, and Chick Corea (in the
original Return to Forever) represented her most admirable musical
efforts. In the past two decades, however, her work has been
frequently plagued by too many musical uncertainties. With this new
outing, however, she returns to her Brazilian roots with a collection
of uneven, if often attractive, interpretations of songs by
Nascimento. In the process, she leaves behind much of her earlier
style but, unfortunately, not all of her more recent problems with
singing in tune.</TE>

<HD>There's No Accounting for Andersen's Miscalculations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Enron Corp. shareholders and their lawyers circled around
accounting firm Arthur Andersen in January, the company offered $750
million to quickly end the civil litigation sprouting from its work
as the bankrupt energy trader's auditor.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers turned down the deal, hoping for more. They may end up
with much less.</LD>
<LD>   That rejection is just one in a series of events that, at nearly
every turn, conspired to doom both Andersen and Enron investors, who
saw the accounting firm as the best deep-pockets source of
restitution for their multibillion-dollar loss in the energy trader's
collapse.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen's last offer was about $300million, but even William
Lerach, the senior class-action attorney in the case, wonders whether
it can now come up with that much.</TE>
<TE>   As Andersen's obstruction-of-justice trial continues this week in
U.S District Court in Houston, the firm is splintering, with as many
as 100 agreements to sell its various office and practices groups.
But it's not clear whether the deals will provide funds to settle
Enron-related claims.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, shareholders, creditors and other parties have gone to
court, variously seeking to block the deals or at least force
Andersen to provide more financial details about the transactions.
These groups hope to tap any money Andersen collects.</TE>
<TE>   Clients are fleeing. Just the value of the business that has left
Andersen, if it had been packaged and sold, might have brought $500
million to $1 billion to fund a settlement, estimated Allan Koltin, a
Chicago-based accounting industry consultant who has worked as an
advisor to Andersen partners and potential suitors.</TE>
<TE>   Defections since Enron's bankruptcy filing in December have cost
Andersen more than $835 million in revenue, according to a tally of
public accounting fee records and other documents by the Los Angeles
Times. That measure tracks only lost fees from publicly traded
companies. Combined with the desertion of dozens of private company
clients, Andersen has lost close to $1 billion of business to rival
firms, according to accounting industry experts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's business the other firms got for free without paying a
single penny to the government to cover any fines or to help Enron
shareholders," Koltin said. "I don't understand why something wasn't
done months ago. Everyone knew how many clients were going to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials declined to comment, but attorneys, former
government regulators and Andersen partners who have watched the
debacle unfold outlined a series of missteps:</TE>
<TE>   * Andersen executives didn't recognize the precariousness of the
firm's position quickly enough. Then, as the partnership's leaders
learned of document destruction and other actions that placed the
firm in jeopardy, they were unable to devise an effective crisis
management strategy.</TE>
<TE>   * Attorneys in the class-action suits didn't anticipate that
Andersen's business would vaporize so quickly, diminishing their
ability to collect a large settlement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The government didn't heed warnings that a criminal
obstruction-of-justice indictment of the firm--rather than
individuals--for destroying documents sought in the federal
investigation of Enron's accounting probably would destroy Andersen.
The firm's partners believe Justice Department lawyers were egged on
by the Bush administration, which was fearful of charges of
favoritism because of its close ties to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Litigation Hampers Firm's Dismantling</TE>
<TE>   The result is turning out to be what proponents of accounting
industry reform feared; with the collapse of Andersen, the industry
will be concentrated in the hands of four powerful firms.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a perfect storm of elements whipping things around,"
said Alan Schulman, a veteran class-action securities litigator. "We
have all of these forces at work and no one making good decisions."</TE>
<TE>   It's no longer clear whether Andersen will survive long enough for
an agreement to be reached. Talks over Andersen's most recent
$300-million settlement offer broke up two weeks ago because of
squabbling between Enron creditors and shareholders over how to
divide the money.</TE>
<TE>   At best, Andersen will emerge from this scandal as a small firm
with a fraction of the staff and the $4.3 billion in U.S. revenue it
had six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a hard time seeing much left of Andersen six months from
now," said a senior partner in the firm, who declined to be
identified because he feared government reprisal. "The Department of
Justice put us out of business."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's ability to dismantle itself in an orderly fashion is
hampered by its civil and criminal litigation.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in announcing Wednesday a $284-million deal to
acquire 23 independent Andersen consulting units, KPMG Consulting
Inc. said the agreement "is subject to the satisfactory resolution of
potential liability issues."</TE>
<TE>   As each day passes without resolution of the civil and criminal
cases, Andersen's rivals get for free what they otherwise would have
had to buy. Ernst &amp; Young, the nation's third-largest accounting
firm, appears to be the early winner, picking up 89 clients and
$205million of former Andersen work. Each of the three other players,
which with Andersen and Ernst &amp; Young made up the industry's Big Five
firms, have won client billings of more than $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset of the Enron crisis, members of the class-action bar
recognized that they shared an interest with Andersen's partners in
seeing the firm survive. A viable Andersen represented the Enron
shareholders' best source of recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Such a goal was the center of early settlement talks, the senior
partner said.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the settlement that was on the table, we would have devoted
a significant portion of our salaries to pay Enron shareholders over
a 10-year period," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was rejected by the class-action attorneys, who were
looking to get more money from the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Andersen partner said the firm's willingness to
encumber its profit for such a long period was an example of how it
planned to accept responsibility for the Enron mess. But others say
Andersen acted too slowly to save itself.</TE>
<TE>   As the Enron crisis broke, Andersen's senior leadership began to
act out an organizational death wish, said Richard C. Breeden, former
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   One glaring failure was not assessing the damage to its
relationship with federal regulators resulting from a series of
recent problems with other clients, he said. Barely six months
earlier, Andersen paid the SEC a $7-million fine--the largest for an
accounting firm--to settle allegations that it issued false and
misleading reports in its audit of Waste Management Inc. A year
earlier, Andersen paid Sunbeam Corp. shareholders $110 million to
settle a fraud lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Having acknowledged that staff destroyed thousands of documents at
multiple offices sought in the federal probe, and already facing SEC
sanction, there's only one rational strategy, said Breeden: Tell the
truth, fire top management and everyone involved with Enron and beg
the government for mercy in the interest of causing the least
disruption to the nation's financial reporting system.</TE>
<TE>   "The most inexplicable thing in all of this is why Andersen did
not immediately accept responsibility and settle quickly," Breeden
said. "I think it is an example of the lawyers taking control of how
Andersen should respond instead of the business people.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, the line out of Andersen should have recognized its
failure and conceded that it would have to pay its share of damages,"
Breeden said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tactical Errors Made in Client Relations</TE>
<TE>   That was Andersen's plan, the senior partner said, but it was
tripped up by the aggressive stance of the Justice Department. Other
Andersen executives, including managing partner Larry Gorrell and
former Chief Executive Joseph F. Berardino, did not return calls
seeking comment for this report.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino told Congress in December that the accounting firm was
in effect hoodwinked by Enron. A month later, Andersen admitted that
its staff destroyed Enron documents. It then blamed the action on a
rogue employee, David B. Duncan, the senior Houston partner on the
Enron account, when other evidence pointed to an institutional effort
across several offices. Duncan admitted guilt in a plea agreement and
looks to be a star witness as the Justice Department goes after the
accounting firm and Enron's senior executives.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen forced the Justice Department to indict it by being
arrogant and denying something everybody else knew," Breeden said.
"You can't destroy evidence and obstruct justice. We forced President
Nixon from office for no less."</TE>
<TE>   Just as Andersen misjudged the federal prosecutors, it also made a
series of tactical errors in its client relations.</TE>
<TE>   A letter from Andersen's attorney to the Justice Department was
leaked in March, just a day before the indictment was unsealed. The
letter said that such an indictment "would place the survival of
Arthur Andersen LLP in grave jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   The unintended consequence of that statement, Breeden said, was to
force clients to find new auditors. No responsible board member at an
Andersen client would stick with a firm that by its own estimate
probably would go out of business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the indictment and the leaking of the letter, at the
start of the period when companies pick their auditors for the coming
year, compounded Andersen's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Before the indictment, Andersen attempted to appease its critics
and reassure clients by asking Paul A. Volcker, the well-respected
former Federal Reserve Board chairman, to head an independent
oversight board that it claimed had the power to make sweeping
changes in leadership and policies. Volcker offered to take control
of the firm after the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   But this initiative also misfired. Volcker waited for Andersen to
give clear signals that its partnership was agreeable to massive
changes in its policies and structures. He also expected Andersen to
work more quickly to settle the criminal and civil litigation it
faced.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indictment Considered the Turning Point</TE>
<TE>   Instead of supporting Volcker, Andersen's partners stepped up
negotiations to move their business to rival firms. Most of the 1,700
partners were more concerned about an exit strategy than creating a
new firm under Volcker that would shed consulting and much of its tax
practice to focus on auditing, said Koltin, the industry consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Though Berardino resigned, Volcker, 74, did not move forcefully to
take control of Andersen and dictate changes, instead insisting on
measures such as suspension of the indictment and progress toward a
settlement of the civil litigation before he would step in.</TE>
<TE>   "In a survival situation the person who is brought in to solve the
problem has to be able to plunge themselves in full time," Breeden
said. "This can't be done from an advisory board."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department also was culpable in the firm's rapid
erosion, said Randolph Beatty, dean of the USC school of accounting.
Beatty said prosecutors should have understood how their actions
would endanger Andersen's ability to survive. Instead of indicting
the institution, they should have gone after the individuals who were
involved in the document destruction, he said. Duncan is the only
individual associated with Andersen to be charged in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen and its legal team believed the Justice Department would
not indict the firm, in part because Andersen had told prosecutors
about the document destruction. According to attorneys involved in
similar litigation, companies that voluntarily report wrongdoing
typically win some leniency.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen partners who talked to The Times for this report remain
angry about how the Justice Department treated the firm. Moreover,
the Justice Department appears to have gyrated widely in its dealings
with Andersen. According to the March 13 letter from Andersen
attorneys seeking to persuade the government not to indict the firm,
the Justice Department essentially gave Andersen an ultimatum: Plead
guilty by 9 a.m. March 14 or face indictment.</TE>
<TE>   It rejected an Andersen proposal to defer prosecution in return
for firing individuals responsible for the document destruction and
agreeing to a special monitor to oversee reforms.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, after the indictment was unsealed, the
government resumed negotiations with Andersen over a deferred
prosecution deal, but ultimately aborted talks and decided to go to
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Most involved in Andersen's survival efforts agree that the
indictment was the turning point.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Andersen would have done fine financially if it were not
for the indictment," class-action attorney Lerach said. "Sure, there
would have been some harm to its reputation and lost business, but
nothing approaching what has occurred."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enron Shareholders Looking for Restitution</TE>
<TE>   Lerach, who once hoped to collect more than $1 billion from
Andersen, according to people familiar with the case, said the
question of whether litigants should have accepted Andersen's
$750-million settlement offer is irrelevant. The accounting firm's
deteriorating financial condition would have prevented it from making
the payments even if Lerach had agreed.</TE>
<TE>   In recent settlement talks, Enron's creditors--primarily its
bankers--wanted as much as half of the money Andersen offered. That
irked attorneys for the shareholders, who named many of the same
banks as defendants in the class-action lawsuit, alleging that they
were culpable in the aggressive financial maneuvers that led to the
energy trader's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a hideously complicated situation in which people were
trying to settle complex claims on a very tight time frame," Lerach
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though efforts to settle with Andersen may resume, for now
shareholders are looking elsewhere, including to Wall Street banks
that did work for Enron, for restitution.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just too many competing interests, too many
uncertainties and insufficient resources to make it all work," Lerach
said.</TE>

<HD>Drug Discount Cards for Seniors Not Relieving Pain of High
Prices</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Firms admit highly publicized offers are a
limited, interim remedy for rising prescription costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonita Harrison takes so many medications that she has to keep a
list. There's Premarin for estrogen replacement therapy, Aciphex for
heartburn and Nasonex for allergies. There's Flovent, albuterol and
Triam-A for asthma. She also takes Fergon as an iron supplement and
prednisone to supplement her cortisone production.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison manages to pay for all this on her $15,000 annual income
by using generics whenever she can. But when her doctor told her she
also needed the Merck &amp; Co. blood pressure drug Cozaar, she was
looking at paying as much as $56 a month, the full retail price.</LD>
<LD>   The 62-year-old Hawthorne resident seems a perfect candidate for
one of the drug discount cards being offered to seniors. But Merck is
not one of the seven pharmaceutical companies that will participate
in the Together Rx card, which would reduce prices by 20% to 40% on
more than 150 medicines for low-income Medicare enrollees who lack
drug coverage. Merck's own free-drugs program for low-income people
can't help her either--it's only for those with no drug coverage. And
Harrison's PacifiCare HMO prescription plan won't cover Cozaar.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess people expect us to walk from the job to the grave and
skip retirement," Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's problem illustrates why many critics say the
pharmaceutical industry's highly touted drug discount cards and
free-drugs plans offer little or no help to the majority of older
Americans who are struggling with the sharp rise in prescription
medicine prices.</TE>
<TE>   The Medicare program, which serves about 39 million Americans,
does not pay for prescription drugs purchased at pharmacies. Many
Medicare recipients get medicine coverage through their HMO plans,
but about 11 million have no HMO coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Several health plans, coping with rising costs as doctors and
hospitals demand higher pay for their services, have made deep cuts
in their prescription benefits or have pulled out of some regions,
increasing the ranks of the underinsured.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical companies and supporters of discount cards
acknowledge that the discount card programs are a limited, interim
measure.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't take the place of Medicare modernization that includes
meaningful prescription drug coverage," Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesman
Mark Monseau said.</TE>
<TE>   "These discount cards will help some people save a little money,"
said John Rother, legislative director for the AARP, which supports
the Together Rx program announced April 10 by GlaxoSmithKline,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Novartis, Abbott Laboratories, Aventis,
Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. Rother likened the hundreds of
other discount drug cards already on the market to "frequent flier
programs--good marketing but not always the greatest deal."</TE>
<TE>   Others were more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a case to be made that this is more of a public
relations issue than getting folks the drugs they need," said Amanda
McCloskey, director of health policy for the Families USA Foundation
in Washington. "This really isn't the answer."</TE>
<TE>   Both supporters and critics of the pharmaceutical industry agree
on one point: Congress must pass and the president must sign Medicare
reform legislation that will make it easier for all seniors to get
the medications they need.</TE>
<TE>   But estimates of the cost of such a program over 10 years range
from $350 billion to as much as $800 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to cost a lot more than anyone suspects," said Jack
Lewin of the California Medical Assn., noting that there also is
pressure on Congress to raise pay rates for doctors who treat
Medicare patients, particularly in California.</TE>
<TE>   Something must be done in the interim, and drug discount cards and
other forms of discounted prices aren't enough, critics say. They
point to an extraordinary four-year series of prescription spending
increases of at least 17% a year.</TE>
<TE>   At least one-third of the 2001 drug-spending increase came from
higher prices, said the National Institute for Health Care
Management, with the rest coming from greater overall demand for
drugs and patients switching to more expensive brands.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also question pharmaceutical companies' sincerity in
offering price breaks because the industry is being sued by several
states for alleged price-fixing schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Some health plans and the Federal Trade Commission also charge
that the industry conspires to keep lower-cost generics off the
market.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators from Northern border
states is sponsoring a bill that would help Americans save as much as
$38 billion a year by allowing prescription drug sales through
Canada, where tight controls have reined in prices.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmaceutical industry defends its pricing with research on
the costs of bringing medications to market. A December study by the
Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development said the cost of
developing the average drug rose from $231 million in 1987 to $802
million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the companies participating in Together Rx,
such as GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne, call their plan
"a noble effort" that was supported by several governors, members of
Congress and organizations such as the National Council on the Aging.</TE>
<TE>   Rhyne said 55,000 people have signed up for GlaxoSmithKline's
Orange Card for drug discounts since it was rolled out in January.
Rhyne said Orange Card holders were averaging savings of 30% on their
drug costs, and that the Together Rx card is expected to provide
similar savings.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer Inc., the nation's largest drug maker, says its Pfizer for
Living Share Card plan has generated even more interest, enrolling
80,000 in its first three months. For low-income people without drug
coverage, the Share Card offers a 30-day supply of any Pfizer drug
for a $15 fee that goes toward the cost of distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer Chief Executive Hank McKinnell scoffed at the notion that
his company's program won't help many seniors, saying in an interview
that "there are about 7 million Americans who can be helped by this
program."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say generic versions of brand name products often are
cheaper than the discounted prices. Some cards have monthly fees,
aren't honored by some pharmacies and won't cover all the drugs the
patient needs. And the "up to 65%" savings that some advertise is a
pipe dream.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the time the discount [price] is higher than our regular
senior discount price," said John Tilly, an independent pharmacy
owner of the Zweber Apothecary in Downey and 14 other locations. "A
lot of times they don't really save the patient money, but the
patient is paying a monthly fee to keep their card active."</TE>
<TE>   Some older Americans, such as Dan and Rita Cohn, say their needs
were too immediate to wait for congressional or drug industry relief.</TE>
<TE>   The Cohns, of Hollywood, Fla., had a modest retirement dream of
traveling the nation in their motor home. Instead, the treasured
vehicle is up for sale. "We spent $4,700 on prescription drugs last
year," Rita Cohn said. "It was either the motor home or the drugs. It
has come to that."</TE>
<TE>   Their combined income exceeds the Together Rx card's $38,000
income limit for couples. Their Medicare HMO drug coverage has been
slashed. Now, Dan Cohn, a 73-year-old Army veteran, has resorted to
the local veterans center, where he has a $7 co-pay for his
medications.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a real flag-waver now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Cohn, 70, has turned to Canadian pharmacies that will accept
her six prescriptions by fax and mail the drugs back. She said a
one-month supply of Pfizer's cholesterol drug Lipitor from Canada
costs $70, well below the $110 she pays locally.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why I'm so crazy about Canada," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Helen Cecil, who lives on a fixed income of $1,000 a month in
Paramount, is among the most desperate. Her trailer park rent costs
her $421 a month. She gets a bit of a break on her cholesterol,
hypertension and arthritis medications from a low-cost mail-order
company, but she still spends $150 a month on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   She can't get a price break on Lipitor through Pfizer's discount
program, in part because Lipitor isn't covered by her HMO. With the
help of the Center for Health Care Rights in Los Angeles, Cecil hopes
to find another HMO that includes her doctor and covers Lipitor.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Cecil gets free samples from her doctor, but she
knows that can't last.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have to pay for all of it, I'll have to cut down on food or
something," she said.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Subpoenas Issued</LD>
<LD>   Over Enron Memos</LD>
<LD>   U.S. regulators released memos written by Enron Corp. lawyers in
2000 that detailed an array of strategies used to manipulate prices
in California's deregulated electricity markets. According to one
memo, one of the ploys "may have contributed" to a significant power
emergency on Dec. 5, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional investigators subpoenaed five current and former
lawyers for Enron to appear at a hearing this week and state
officials demanded regulatory reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, documents released by Congress suggest Enron's board
of directors--which has insisted that it was kept in the dark about
the energy company's financial problems--was warned in early 1999
that the company's accounting practices "push limits."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan to Testify</TE>
<TE>   in Andersen Trial</TE>
<TE>   The trial of accounting firm Arthur Andersen, accused by the
federal government of shredding tons of documents related to one of
its clients, Enron Corp. opened in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, the Chicago-based firm automatically would lose its
ability to audit public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Among the witnesses for the government was an Andersen partner who
testified that a company lawyer advised auditors to destroy drafts of
memos about Enron accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   That testimony paved the way for the appearance this week of David
Duncan, the former head of Andersen's Enron audit team, who is
expected to be the government's star witness.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Lets</TE>
<TE>   Key Rate Stand</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate unchanged in
an effort to prop up an economy that, despite more than six months of
growth and impressive new efficiency gains, continues to slouch
uncertainly toward recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Fed policymakers left the so-called Fed funds rate--the interest
that banks charge each other for short-term loans--at a 40-year low
of 1.75%, where it has been since December. The move assures
Americans that they will continue to enjoy some of the lowest
borrowing costs in decades.</TE>
<TE>   Despite widespread predictions earlier in the year that the
economy would recover quickly, the central bank said after its
meeting that "the degree of the strengthening in final demand over
the coming quarters ... is still uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   'Spider-Man' Raises</TE>
<TE>   the Bar for New Films</TE>
<TE>   With a three-day box-office take of $114.8 million, Sony Pictures
Entertainment's "Spider-Man" set a new weekend benchmark for a
movie's debut and put increasing pressure on Hollywood studios to
open big.</TE>
<TE>   Three of four moviegoers nationwide went to see the screen
adaptation of the classic Marvel comic books that follow the
adventures of the superhero.</TE>
<TE>   Several big-muscle films have yet to hit multiplexes, including
George Lucas' "Star Wars: Episode II--Attack of the Clones," which
opens Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Sony also is hoping to cash in on the another kind of blockbuster
success--animated films--and appointed two veteran industry
executives to head its new feature animation business.</TE>
<TE>   Penney Finkelman Cox and Sandra Rabins, who started DreamWorks
SKG's animation division at the studio's inception in 1994 and were
executive producers of its Oscar-winning hit "Shrek," will head the
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Seeks Settlement in Analyst Probe</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to bring an end to the latest investment industry scandal,
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. made a settlement offer to the New York attorney
general, who is accusing the firm's Internet analysts of making
supposedly unbiased public pronouncements that failed to reflect
scorn that they privately expressed for many companies.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Merrill's proposal addresses Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer's demands that the firm pay a large fine, accept blame for
deceptive practices and make changes to ensure analysts aren't
skewing their findings to drum up lucrative business for Merrill
bankers working on stock and bond issues and takeover deals.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's office called the discussions with Merrill productive,
and a hearing was postponed until Thursday to give the parties more
time to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Investigating Cigarette Smuggling</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities are investigating allegations that cigarette
makers R.J. Reynolds and Japan Tobacco Inc. have violated trade
sanctions against Iraq by channeling billions of dollars worth of
cigarettes into the country through intermediaries, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations of illegal shipments to Iraq first surfaced
publicly in a civil lawsuit by the European Union, which accused
Reynolds, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris Cos. of evading hundreds of
millions of dollars in taxes by promoting a vast cigarette smuggling
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco companies said they were unaware of any investigation.</TE>
<TE>   'Magic' Johnson Enters Suburban Market</TE>
<TE>   Earvin "Magic" Johnson, the basketball-great-turned-businessman
who has suggested he may run for L.A. mayor in 2005, opened a fitness
and sports club in Sherman Oaks Galleria, a departure from his usual
developments in the city's underserved communities.</TE>
<TE>   As founder and chief executive of Magic Johnson Enterprises,
Johnson for nine years has been bringing theaters, restaurants and
coffeehouses to urban centers with large minority populations.</TE>
<TE>   But over the last several months his business portfolio has been
gaining an added dimension--diversity. His company recently opened a
Fatburger restaurant in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   And by opening a high-end, high-profile club in the San Fernando
Valley, Johnson gains access to a new constituent group--and a
different demographic.</TE>
<TE>   Mariah Carey Signs</TE>
<TE>   New Record Deal</TE>
<TE>   Pop star Mariah Carey, dumped four months ago by EMI Group after a
disappointing album, signed an estimated $20-million, three-album
deal with rival Universal Music Group, the world's biggest record
company.</TE>
<TE>   EMI paid Carey $30 million to buy out her contract after the fall
release of a poor-selling soundtrack album, and last summer she
suffered a breakdown. Still, Carey was the target of a fierce bidding
war, and she signed her new deal with Universal's Island division
after turning down offers from several competitors, including
Bertelsmann Music Group's J Records and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s
Elektra label.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe everything happens for a reason," Carey told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   More Tourists Than Expected Visit L.A. Area</TE>
<TE>   Despite a drop-off in tourism after Sept. 11 and gloomy outlooks
for visitors to Los Angeles and Orange counties for all of 2001, more
tourists came and spent last year than officials initially estimated.</TE>
<TE>   The final tally for Orange County showed a 1.7% increase in
visitor attendance from 2000, instead of the 5% decline officials
were bracing for immediately after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, 1.8% fewer tourists visited in 2001, but
that was better than the initial 5% decline in tourist traffic
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists spent $18.5 billion in the two counties.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic Copyright Case to Proceed</TE>
<TE>   In an important legal victory for publishers, movie studios and
record companies, a federal judge ruled that a controversial 1998 law
bars the distribution of any tools that crack electronic locks on a
copyrighted work.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act said it allows
copyright owners to wipe out consumers' ability to copy music, books
and movies for personal use. But Hollywood studios and record labels,
alarmed by the flood of unauthorized copies online, are pushing for
even stronger measures to limit what consumers can do.</TE>
<TE>   Railroad Settles Suit Over Genetic Testing</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-six railroad workers will share in a $2.2-million
settlement of a landmark lawsuit that accused Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act by
secretly conducting genetic tests to investigate workers'
compensation claims.</TE>
<TE>   Filed in February 2001, the suit targeted the first known case of
on-the-job genetic testing.</TE>
<TE>   The Fort Worth-based company, which also agreed to refrain from
further genetic testing, said none of its actions "were contrary to
the law."</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>Enron's Lullaby Sang to Our Greedy Side</HD>
<DH>Like rubes, we bought into the deregulation scam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a scam from the beginning. We were looking for easy gain--and
so was Enron.</LD>
<LD>   Energy deregulation was a load of fairy dust all along.</LD>
<LD>   The unregulated market? We energy consumers thought we could cut
ourselves a sweetheart deal. Or at least our politicians did, and too
few of us bothered to object. We would stop taking care of ourselves
and let the free market take care of us. We'd make out like crazy. So
would industry. And everyone would live happily ever after, so sleep
tight, my dears.</LD>
<TE>   Now, oh boy, we wag our fingers at the discovery of serpents and
griffins in our bedtime story. Looks like Enron manipulated energy
supplies to California and made a killing. What a shock. The same
political leaders who tucked us in with their soothing promises about
deregulation are now the loudest to protest about being "gamed."</TE>
<TE>   Well, what did they expect, really? What did we expect?</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. Every bit of justice that can be imposed on
those arrogant highfliers of Enron and the other wheedlers of
deregulated energy is only half of what is owed, as far as I'm
concerned.</TE>
<TE>   But we shouldn't let ourselves off the hook either, and certainly
not our elected leaders.</TE>
<TE>   We were sold a lie with the deregulation fairy tale. But let's
remember that we hungrily bought it. Enron was eager; so were we.
This wasn't a pickpocket operation. This was a con and we were
players, drawn in by the shortsighted hope of easy money, cheap
electricity, carefree living. And, oh yes, bountiful campaign
contributions for those who smoothed the path.</TE>
<TE>   The "market" will take care of us.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't. It won't. It can't.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's just-released internal memos about Western energy trades
are said to be "the smoking gun." They are. What they prove is that
the unregulated free market isn't so free at all, and never was. The
free market doesn't care if California's classrooms go dark, or
stoplights go blank and create terrible accidents. Those are, as one
Enron memo put it, "a public relations risk." The unregulated free
market doesn't care if a family can heat its house or pay its bills.
The free market cares singularly about profit. Look it up. It's
called "fiduciary responsibility" to investors. It's the supreme law
and guiding principle of our particular brand of free-marketeering,
and we see it every day, everywhere we look.</TE>
<TE>   One big surprise about these Enron memos is that they have
generated so much surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing advantage, creating opportunity where none exists, playing
two sides against each other, profiting from shortages, holding back
until the price rises, betting on someone's misfortune--these are the
daily bread of all market traders. True, not every company gloats
about it as Enron did, or calls their schemes by names like Death
Star and Fat Boy, but the principles are the same.</TE>
<TE>   Should we be surprised, really, when an energy middleman buys $250
worth of California electricity and resells it to Oregon, where it
fetches $1,200? So what if the sale contributed to a power emergency
in California? Where is it written, or even presumed, that a
wheeler-dealer is supposed to answer to anything higher than a stack
of money?</TE>
<TE>   What is wrong with 500% profit anyway, if you can get it? How
about 250%? Is 125% still too much? How many of those who object now
were actually invested in energy stocks during 2000, when these deals
were being hatched? You know who you are, Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.). And John Balzar too. Sure enough, I looked back at the
mutual fund in my 401(k): I was an Enron man too.</TE>
<TE>   Look at it the other way. Just how were consumers going to benefit
from deregulation? Let's see, energy companies were going to be so
hungry for our business that they would rush out and build new
plants--not here, of course, because we don't want the blight or
pollution, but somewhere else. Then we'd be abuzz with power. It
would be a buyers' market. Energy companies would struggle to achieve
the lowest rates by outsourcing their work force, slashing wages,
deferring maintenance--all those things that free marketers
euphemistically describe as "efficiencies." Who knows, maybe they'd
have to bribe us with Beanie Babies and unlimited minutes of "free"
electricity on weekends if we'd just let them power up the
streetlights.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work out that way. That's another thing about
unregulated free markets: You can lose as big as you can win. They
were lighting up fine cigars and buying mansions back in Houston.
They called it the American way.</TE>
<TE>   Deregulating and putting in jeopardy something as essential to the
civic organism as electricity was an awful mistake. Its champions
took advantage of public distrust in government. They sang sweet
lullabies about a far-off dreamland where people would do each other
right by looking out only for themselves. We had to listen to the
greedy part of our hearts to believe it.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Symbolism Falls Flat in Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's "viva Mexico" routine is wearing thin. Symbolism,
rather than substance, is all that's left of the once-hopeful
relationship between the White House and Mexican President Vicente
Fox.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has been reduced to holding Cinco de Mayo fiestas at the
White House and, now, possibly sending a Latino ambassador to Mexico
City. Texas Railroad Commissioner Tony Garza, a Mexican American,
reportedly may be nominated for the post.</LD>
<LD>   This is not to take anything away from Garza, a Bush ally and
popular Tejano pol. Garza is seen as a rising GOP star in Texas,
where his job includes oversight of the state's oil and gas industry.
Of course, if nominated, Garza could be in for a grilling on how much
oversight his office had over a Texas company called Enron.</LD>
<TE>   But even assuming that Garza can maneuver through the political
shoals of the Enron scandal to become Bush's man in Mexico City,
that's no guarantee he'll be able to help the president get the
U.S.-Mexico relationship back on track. Hope of a new era in
U.S.-Mexico relations faded fast after Sept. 11. Fox's dream of an
open border has given way to tighter border controls. And talk of
development aid to poor regions of Mexico has been replaced with
military aid to nations such as Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Garza's ethnicity may be a big deal to Latino activists who keep
scorecards of government appointments, but being Mexican American
isn't enough in Mexico. The Bush people may have forgotten, but the
Mexicans cared little for two former U.S. ambassadors--Julian Nava
and John Gavin--despite their family ties to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a cool reception is almost guaranteed if the new U.S.
ambassador shows up with nada to offer Fox regarding the biggest
issue on the U.S.-Mexico agenda: the continued illegal status of many
Mexican workers in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's government has been pressing forward with unilateral steps
to regularize the status of those workers, most notably issuing
secure new identity cards to them through Mexican consulates in this
country, so they will presumably be less exploitable in our
underground economy.</TE>
<TE>   So far the Bush administration has not even acknowledged this
comparatively bold step. Apparently, the White House has put
discussions of a Mexican labor migration agreement way down on the
State Department's "to do" list.</TE>
<TE>   That's not smart because Fox desperately needs some kind of
migration deal to maintain his political influence with an
increasingly assertive Mexican Congress, still controlled by the
opposition parties that Fox defeated in Mexico's presidential
election in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The personal popularity that carried Fox into office is slipping.
Mexican presidents serve one six-year term, and Fox's successor is
unlikely to be as cooperative with the U.S. as Fox has tried to be.
Mexican political analysts warn that Fox could be reduced to
lame-duck status by next year, when midterm elections are held in
Mexico, unless he can rebound politically. And nothing would get the
Mexican public's attention like a migration deal with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The average Mexican--as opposed to Mexico City's elites--sees
Fox's push for a migration deal with Bush as the key test of the Fox
presidency, according to a former top Mexican official I spoke with
recently. Fox will fail that test unless Bush offers him "more than
nice speeches and handshakes."</TE>
<TE>   My source pointed to two recent setbacks for Latino immigrants in
the U.S. that got lots of attention in Mexico but were virtually
ignored by the White House: the Senate delay of Bush's proposal to
allow some Latino immigrants to legalize their status without leaving
the U.S. and a Supreme Court decision giving employers the right to
fire illegal immigrants who engage in union activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Even a few words from Bush expressing concern about the negative
impact the Supreme Court ruling might have on Mexican workers would
have helped Fox," the former official said. "But Fox got nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, that is, except possibly the shallow symbolism of a
Latino ambassador.</TE>

<HD>Siege Mentality in Fortress Europe</HD>
<DH>Unification has brought with it new fears of immigration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie, a fellow at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, D.C., is an internationally
syndicated columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Europe seems to bubble with hate and paranoia. Many Europeans are
devastated over their currency changing to the euro, having their
national borders stolen from them. And maybe, just maybe, they'll
have to switch to a foreign language--all this as part of becoming a
united Europe.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel," a senior left-wing European journalist told me, "that my
private home that gave birth to eight generations of my family
suddenly became a motel where anyone--and I mean anyone--can rent a
room for the night. And I have to supply the sheets and towels."</LD>
<LD>   Europeans are living through a series of convulsions that are
going to affect them--and the entire world--drastically. The
unification of Europe brings with it a fear and panic of immigration,
especially from Muslim countries. Europeans know the magnet of
borderless economies. Riches and opportunity will always lure
immigrants from impoverished countries.</LD>
<TE>   The Pat Buchanans of Europe are having a field day. They are doing
well in almost every national and municipal election. And there may
be another reason for the rise of the right in Europe: the Republican
victory in the U.S. The way the U.S. votes will always tell you how
Europe will vote. Europe subconsciously follows the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   I spoke on Friday with Austria's Joerg Haider, who has tried for
years to escape his extreme right-wing image, to no avail. His notion
is that Europe is very concerned about Muslim immigration growing
dramatically in numbers because, in contradiction to the
Judeo-Christian modern tradition, Muslims do not separate mosque and
state. As a result, he says, they are a state within a state.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem with Muslims coming to Austria," he said, "as
long as they know how to adjust to our democratic system that
separates church and state just like the United States does.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] I think that we--Europeans--should help the Arab countries
to build their own economies so that they become attractive enough to
their own people, to make them stay home."</TE>
<TE>   It seems that the right in Europe has another target or scapegoat
now: Islam. Judaism, the old devil, is suddenly a religion worthy of
respect and admiration.</TE>
<TE>   Said Haider: "I would like to give priority of immigration to Jews
who wish to come to my country, Austria. We in Austria know how much
the Jews have contributed to our culture and economy, much beyond
their proportionate percentage in the population. Any place Jews come
to, its economy flourishes."</TE>
<TE>   Even Britain's extreme right leader and head of the British
National Party, Nick Griffin, claimed in an interview to Israel's
Maariv newspaper that "the reason for the tremendous influence that
Jews have on the British media is because they are, on average,
smarter than the rest of the white population. They have a higher
IQ."</TE>
<TE>   Then Griffin, whose party just made inroads to respectability by
gaining some seats in the municipal elections a few days ago, claimed
that he hoped Israel would not collapse, God forbid, "because we'll
have huge groups of Jewish refugees knocking on our doors."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin, like France's Jean-Marie Le Pen, Haider and all other
right-wingers in Europe today, believes that the main problem is with
the Muslims because "even if we would stop all the Muslim immigration
to Britain today, they have such a high birthrate that eventually
they will fulfill their dream to turn Britain to a Muslim republic."</TE>
<TE>   Even Hans Janicheck, the former secretary-general of the Socialist
International organization, admits that "the EU will have a big
problem if and when Muslim Turkey manages to become a member of the
European Union, something that will open all the borders of Europe to
the Turks."</TE>
<TE>   The European fear of Islamic immigration may be overshadowed by
the desire of Europe's political parties to win the newcomers' votes.
This would create tremors of European anti-Americanism intended to
please the masses of forthcoming Arab voters.</TE>

<LD>They sit there like tireless, loyal sentinels at the end of millions
of rural driveways. They are rusty or shiny, tiny or spacious,
creative statement or utilitarian afterthought. But America's
roadside mailboxes have for generations been the down-home gateway
between this big land's country residents and the not-always-friendly
world outside, the one that sends tax bills, junk mail and, recently,
some pipe bombs.</LD>
<LD>   America's rural residents have long thought of themselves as at
least apart from, possibly even above, the criminal mayhem, personal
betrayals and unpredictable terror of the mushrooming urban and
suburban areas whose bright lights and exciting opportunities
dominate television and suck away so many young people. That's not
factually true, of course. Smaller towns and farms have over the
years seen their smaller share of brutal, even bizarre, crimes. The
"In Cold Blood" murders were on a farm. The Unabomber lived by an
idyllic mountain village. And, by chance, little Shanksville, Pa.,
was a Sept. 11 crash site.</LD>
<TE>   Security isn't the countryside's first thought. Many there do not
routinely lock cars or homes. Indeed, that's how residents spot
newcomers; they're the ones locking cars on Main Street. So even
though police arrested a pipe-bomb suspect, the undeniable reality
that some nut case from afar was infecting these innocent receptacles
with wired explosives is emotionally jarring and chilling, like a
crime wave in a vast neighborhood. Once, it was beyond imagination to
see towering skyscrapers as targets or airliners as intentional
fuel-filled missiles. Those assumptions too were shattered by new
unpredictables.</TE>
<TE>   Country mailboxes, unlike their suburban community-regulated kin,
come in all shapes, sizes and conditions. Boxes are welded atop
chains and old plows. They're left to age naturally or painted bright
colors, the easier to follow directions down roads built straight
along 19th century survey lines where fields slowly warm in the
spring sun. Some mailboxes stand alone, miles from their homestead.
They mark school bus stops and meeting points. Every winter they're
beaten by tons of snow hurled off speeding plows. They're dented by
hail, stiffened by freezing rains, even battered by passing rural
delinquents leaning from cars swinging baseball bats.</TE>
<TE>   Some families wire their distant mailbox to beep the house when
its door is opened. Until this month that could mean two things: The
mailman had just passed or a spouse was almost home. Another little
marker of change in this land. Which may not mean much.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it does.</TE>

<HD>Carter's Cuban Spadework</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The moment former President Jimmy Carter sets foot in Havana today,
the eyes and ears of Cubans will be on him.</LD>
<LD>   Fidel Castro, the nation's dictator for four decades, will be
poised to applaud if, as expected, Carter condemns the U.S. trade
embargo, a cruel and useless sanction endorsed by 10 consecutive U.S.
administrations.</LD>
<LD>   Castro haters, including the Cuban American National Foundation,
and expatriates, mainly in Florida, New Jersey and California, will
save their cheers for Carter's expected statement of support for the
10,000 brave Cubans who have signed a petition to convene a national
referendum that would increase the freedoms of the island's people.</LD>
<TE>   Carter probably will address both issues, echoing views he has
repeatedly expressed. In 2000, for instance, he said: "We should
press for democracy in Cuba, but I don't think we should predicate
the lifting of sanctions on the demise of Fidel Castro. I think the
sanctions are a mistake. They allow Castro to blame all of his
mistakes on Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Carter's soft-spoken, rights-based approach once served him well
with Castro. While in the White House he brought more positive change
to Cuba than any U.S. president before or since. With nudges from
Carter, Castro freed political prisoners. The two gave Cuban
Americans the right to visit their families and agreed to permanent
diplomatic representatives in Washington and Havana.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the first sitting or former U.S. president to visit Cuba
in 43 years, Carter arrives with grudging authorization from the Bush
administration but no diplomatic portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   That's OK. He's not there to issue ultimatums or go belly to belly
with Castro but as an American citizen with a background in defending
human rights. He's there to initiate a dialogue with Cuban citizens
on such matters as racial, sexual and religious discrimination.
They'll talk about the inequities that are creating a two-tiered
society on the communist island as dollars flood in from relatives
who escaped to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   What will all this jawboning accomplish? In the short term, nada.
But the people with whom Carter will be chatting in that gentle
Georgia drawl will be there long after Castro is gone. And when
future U.S. administrations are ready to advance rapport with these
neighbors, they'll have Carter to thank for helping break the ice.</TE>

<LD>Like many of his friends in the San Fernando Valley secession
movement, longtime Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson is no fan
of the city's perennially controversial Community Redevelopment
Agency. That makes his defense of a new downtown redevelopment
project all the better to counter the plan's critics.</LD>
<LD>   The project--which would add 13,000 housing units, provide mental
health services for people who live on the streets and sidewalks of
downtown's skid row and transform ramshackle stretches of the city
core into commercial and industrial spaces--won preliminary council
approval last week. But in the debate beforehand, three other council
members representing the Valley switched their votes to no, echoing
the charges of secession advocates that the redevelopment would
siphon money from the Valley. Because the vote was not unanimous, it
will go back to the council this week for the final approval it
deserves.</LD>
<LD>   A yes vote by the council is not a rubber stamp for a new football
stadium, contrary to what some critics claimed last week. The council
needs to make that clear. If redevelopment funds were to subsidize a
developer's plans to build a stadium, the council would have to
separately debate and approve it, as it would any project seeking
more than $25,000 in redevelopment aid.</LD>
<TE>   Reasonable people have honest differences over spending public
money on redevelopment. But cities establish redevelopment agencies
to spark investment in areas where private developers fear to tread.
Though the agency, because of past problems, requires careful
oversight, it has found the right target.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the dishonest differences, the ones secession
advocates twist to support breaking Los Angeles into two or more
cities. Redevelopment downtown, they say, would deprive the Valley of
its "fair share" of property taxes from the redevelopment area. It
would stick a new Valley city, assuming secession wins voter
approval, with yet more bond debt. It would redirect tax money from
schools, police and parks to downtown "special interests."</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, wrong and wrong.</TE>
<TE>   No one--not the schools, not the county, not the city general fund
that pays for police and parks--loses any of the property taxes
currently collected. If dilapidated properties are redeveloped,
increase in value and thus generate more tax revenue--and that is the
goal--only the amount of the increase is set aside. That money is
used to pay back the city-issued revenue bonds that paid for
improvements. And even then, 20% of any increase is passed on to the
county and schools and another 20% is set aside for housing.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who
says he is neutral but seldom misses a chance to side with his
secessionist constituents, is threatening to sue the city over the
project, repeating the claim that it would take money out of county
coffers and "the mouths of poor people." Since when is helping the
homeless, creating jobs and building houses bad for the poor?
Affordable housing downtown is also the kind of development supported
by homeowners who don't want apartments in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wearing my city hat," longtime Valley representative Bernson
said in announcing his support for the project. "This is good for the
city." That's the kind of thinking Los Angeles needs. It's the kind
of thinking that could even keep the city together.</TE>

<LD>   The chaos was not a victimless crime. The games played in
California's flawed deregulated market caused devastation. Soaring
electricity prices pushed giant utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric  Co.
into Bankruptcy Court and Edison International, parent of utility
Southern California Edison, into insolvency. Livelihoods of working
people were destroyed or imperiled.</LD>
<LD>   The state of California still has to sell $13 billion of municipal
bonds to pay for past electricity purchases. The bonds will be paid
off by the state's electricity users, who will shoulder a debt burden
for decades to come.</LD>
<TE>   It should not have happened. There was always a need for
regulation. If the lawyers who drafted memos on market tactics for
Enron had tried such schemes on the Chicago Board of Trade or Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where wheat and cattle have been traded for 150
years, they would have been suspended and fined for violating
exchange rules.</TE>
<TE>   Though other commodities markets have rules, electricity trading
was never brought under regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which would have prevented Enron's schemes. But
electricity trading will be brought under CFTC regulation if Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) gets her bill proposing regulation of
energy trading through Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Such legislation is sorely needed.</TE>
<TE>   All aspects of electricity are going to come under new regulations
as a result of the debacle in California. The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, the agency charged with oversight of electric
power nationwide, is developing a Standard Market Design as a
framework for regulation.</TE>
<TE>   FERC will support development of local markets in which
independent companies for generation, transmission and
marketing-distribution of electricity will contract with each other
to supply municipal needs. FERC will retain the right to intervene in
local markets if any company's market power is deemed excessive or if
a company is seen to be withholding power to drive up prices.</TE>
<TE>   FERC is expected to formally announce the new policy in July,
sources say. It will represent a far more active stance on regulation
than the federal agency displayed during California's crisis, when
FERC refused to correct unreasonable prices while markets careened
out of control.</TE>
<TE>   The California Power Authority, created last year to negotiate
long-term power contracts for the state, will impose its own
regulations. Long-term contracts will be key to ensuring reasonably
priced electricity supplies, says David Freeman, head of the power
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman's signing of long-term contracts with power suppliers last
year is widely credited with ending sis, although now many of those
contracts are criticized for locking the state into high prices for
years to come. The power authority is attempting to renegotiate
contracts signed last year, and suspicions that suppliers manipulated
prices is giving the state leverage.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity sells today at wholesale prices close to $5 per
megawatt hour--enough electricity to supply 750 homes for one hour.
Many of the contracts Freeman is renegotiating are at prices of $7
per megawatt. And markets, now based on long-term contracts, are far
more stable than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In California's deregulated market, which began in 1998, wholesale
prices of electricity were set daily on a spot market. The state
Public Utilities Commission discouraged Edison, Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric and other electric companies from entering long-term
contracts. The policy proved untenable and made the power markets
vulnerable to manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   How FERC and the state's power authority will mesh their
regulations remains to be negotiated. One regulation FERC is pushing
for is a requirement that California participate in the Regional
Transmission Organization, a power-sharing grid that the federal
agency is setting up in the Western states. But Gov. Gray Davis'
office has resisted the state's joining such a grid for fear of
losing electricity to other states at critical times.</TE>
<TE>   New regulations are sure to make consumers aware of the true cost
of their electricity. They have been sheltered from price movements
by political decrees since deregulation began. Users' bills may rise,
but new regulations also would include incentives for consumers to
use less power.</TE>
<TE>   And regulations requiring greater disclosure from electricity
generators and traders are a certainty for the years ahead. Trading
firms will have to truthfully disclose what supplies of power they
hold and how much they intend to buy. One of the abuses outlined in
the Enron memos involved traders giving false signals to the
California Independent System Operator in order to affect pricing
decisions. The tactic is analogous to a bluff in a poker game. But
supplying electricity is an essential activity, not a game.</TE>
<TE>   The least that can be said of Enron and other firms involved in
California's deregulated market in 2000-2001 is that they behaved
irresponsibly. The antidote to such behavior is regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of regulation should be to make electricity a non-issue.</TE>
<TE>   "When a company wants to build or expand a plant, or a homeowner
wants to build a house, they should not have to face uncertainty as
to the availability or the price of electricity. The price should be
predictable," says Stephen Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the
holding company for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   Regulation won't mean going back to yesteryear, when local
utilities built and owned their power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult to deal with venality of business practices
of companies such as Enron, but that doesn't mean we have to throw
the baby out with the bath water," says Michael Peevey, a newly
appointed member of California's PUC and former president of Southern
California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   It will help to see where we're going if we understand that
deregulation began three decades ago, when President Jimmy Carter's
administration wanted to encourage energy supplies from as many
producers as possible.</TE>
<TE>   It opened the way for industrial plants, oil refineries and other
facilities, which generate electricity, steam and waste heat in their
own processes, to be able to sell excess power to local utilities,
thereby increasing energy supplies without building new power plants.</TE>
<TE>   As variations on power supply systems increased in the 1980s, the
idea of getting away from the old regulated utility system and moving
to flexible markets took hold. And deregulation has done reasonably
well elsewhere. Deregulated systems are being developed, without
major trouble, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Texas and
in the Northeastern states. Those states did not start a system
driven solely by daily pricing for electricity, nor did they force
utility firms to sell their power plants.</TE>
<TE>   California erred in setting up a system vulnerable to cheating and
has paid a price. It's not certain how much the state or its electric
companies can recover from firms that may have cheated. And it's no
help to California that the prime suspect, Enron, has collapsed in
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   But it may be consolation to California and its citizens that this
state's debacle is launching a new era of intelligent thinking about
regulation of electric power.</TE>

<LD>Re: "Greenspan Repeats Call to Expense Stock Options" [May 4].</LD>
<LD>   Much has been discussed recently about improper and misleading
accounting, but one of the most egregious forms of distortions of
reported earning has been endorsed in the boardrooms of many of our
elite corporations and has been supported at the political level from
President Bush on down.</LD>
<LD>   I refer to the failure to expense as compensation stock options
issued to officers and other employees.</LD>
<TE>   It has recently been estimated that shares issued upon the
exercise of options make up approximately 15% of outstanding shares.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, those shares were acquired by the company going
into the open market and buying them, expending billions of dollars,
money that could have been spent to shore up balance sheets, pay down
debt, invest in job-creating activities or pay dividends to
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most respected men in our economic universe, Warren
Buffett and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, have recently come out
strongly against the present accounting treatment. We should listen
to them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Vote Urges BofA Curb on Severance" [April 25] states, "The measure
(shareholder proposal, if passed) is only a request that the
company's board could reject or modify."</LD>
<LD>   Many institutional investors and individual investors delude
themselves into thinking that they have some positive impact on
corporate governance by simply sponsoring nonbinding shareholder
proposals. Most of the proposals that pass are never implemented.</LD>
<LD>   And, even when implemented, no one can determine that the
implementation enhanced shareholder value. Some advocate more/better
disclosure of corporate information.</LD>
<TE>   The more/better disclosure approach incorrectly assumes that
problems will correct themselves with such disclosure. Shareholders
need an effective means to cause their respective board of directors
to cure problems.</TE>
<TE>   If SEC rule/law changes were made whereby director-nominations by
shareholders are required to be included in the corporation's proxy
materials at no cost to the shareholder's nominee(s), such would have
a very positive impact upon corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate directors will only improve corporate governance out of
fear. If the presently entrenched corporate directors fear that they
can be easily replaced by irate shareholders, the true owners of the
corporation, then governance will change for the better.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My mother-in-law is in hospice care and probably will die
within months. In her will, she has given her sons--my husband and
his brother--half of her estate. She is not wealthy, however. The
only asset she and her 80-year-old husband have is their house. My
husband wants to wait until his father dies to sell the house, but I
believe we should sell the place now, put my father-in-law in an
assisted-living center and leave all the money in an account to pay
for his care. When it's gone, he can go on government assistance.</LD>
<LD>   I should tell you that this man was a lousy father and a worse
husband. He deserted the family for years to have an affair, ignored
his children growing up and once physically abused our child, his
grandson. You get the picture: He's a jerk.</LD>
<LD>   Because of his treatment of us, I am not willing to borrow against
our home or to forfeit money in our kids' college funds to pay for
his care. Obviously, my husband disagrees, but I would like to hear
your thoughts. (What makes this worse is that I truly believe my
mother-in-law wants her sons to have the money, rather than have it
spent on her husband, but I really don't see that happening.)</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Actually, what's interesting is that your solution could
provide your father-in-law with a much higher level of care than he
might receive if the house isn't sold.</TE>
<TE>   Still, your influence in this situation is limited. You don't have
to allow your jointly held assets to be spent on the man, but
ultimately it's your husband and his brother who must work out a
solution.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear from your letter whether your father-in-law needs
care now, or whether you're anticipating future needs. If he's
healthy and can live alone, then your husband's reluctance to oust
the old man is understandable. Most people want to remain in their
own homes as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Once he needs care, however, the equation changes.</TE>
<TE>   One option is to let your father-in-law go on government
assistance, also known as Medicaid, right away. That may not be the
most humane approach, however. Medicaid doesn't cover home health
care or assisted living, so you would have to pack the old guy off to
a nursing home. Some children are willing to do that rather than
watch care bills drain away their potential inheritance. But it
doesn't sound like you and your husband are that type of people.</TE>
<TE>   Going on Medicaid also can have future financial consequences.
Medicaid may put a claim against the home after your father-in-law
dies to get reimbursement for the costs of his care.</TE>
<TE>   If your husband wants to avoid the nursing-home route, he and his
brother may be able to borrow against the house's value to pay for
home care. Or, if that's not feasible, they could sell the house and
do as you've suggested, which is to put the money in an account to
pay for an assisted-living center. Only after that money is gone
would your father-in-law have to go on Medicaid and be transferred to
a nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   You obviously married a decent man, who was raised by one who was
not. Your job is to help your husband sort through the options,
without pushing him too hard. He's already dealing with the impending
loss of his mother, and perhaps he's not ready to think about what
may happen to his dad. With your help, though, he and his brother can
consider the options and ultimately pick the right one for your
family.</TE>
<TE>   Education IRAs Can Be Shifted to 529 Plans</TE>
<TE>   Q: In a recent column you talked about how education IRAs, now
known as Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, could be transferred
to a 529 college savings plan. Can you also transfer a Uniform Gift
to Minors Act account as well? I opened them for our kids before the
529 plans were widely available.</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, you can transfer UGMA accounts (or, as they're known in
some states, Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, or UTMA accounts) to a
529 plan. As with education IRAs, however, some special rules apply.</TE>
<TE>   The money in the UGMA or UTMA account legally belongs to your
child.</TE>
<TE>   Even when transferred to a 529 plan, which are state-sponsored
college savings plans now gaining popularity, the money will be your
child's to spend when he or she reaches the legal age limit,
typically 18 or 21.</TE>
<TE>   That undermines one of the advantages of a 529 plan, which gives
parents more control.</TE>
<TE>   When money is contributed directly to a 529, instead of
transferred from a custodial account, the parents can switch
beneficiaries or even withdraw it, with penalties, if the intended
beneficiary doesn't use the money for college.</TE>
<TE>   Still, you'll be getting professional management and tax-free
withdrawals if you transfer the custodial account to the 529. If you
want more information, check out www.savingforcollege .com and
www.collegesavings .org.</TE>

<LD>Before Mona Sahlin was elected to Sweden's parliament, she thought
workplace discrimination between the sexes was a thing of the past.
But, 25 and pregnant, she encountered it all too personally.</LD>
<LD>   "All these men wanted to know why I was there, why I wasn't home
with babies," she said. "I realized that the structures in politics
are made by men for men. It's not something that will just change
with time."</LD>
<LD>   Sahlin and many government and corporate leaders around the world
have made a concerted effort to reduce workplace discrimination and
improve the economic status of women. Yet there's one hurdle that
continually trips up women in the work force all over the
world--children.</LD>
<TE>   As Americans celebrate Mother's Day, it's worth noting that
economists and workplace experts agree that economic inequalities
frequently are tied to parenthood. Childless, never-married American
women earn slightly more than men in the same circumstances,
according to a recent study by the Employment Policy Foundation in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But, by age 45, the average working woman has 3.2 fewer years of
work experience than men, mainly because many women take time off to
raise children, said Ron Bird, the foundation's chief economist.
Women also devote an average of 14.2 hours each week to household
chores; men devote just seven hours.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden Guarantees Affordable Child Care</TE>
<TE>   This "housework effect" might contribute to the earnings advantage
of married men, who make about 15% more than similarly situated
unmarried men, the study said, and might put married women at a
disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden, with a population slightly smaller than metropolitan Los
Angeles, has dealt with gender equality through a series of laws.
Sahlin, the country's minister of industry, said in a recent
interview that these laws have had a dramatic effect, boosting
employment among women to unprecedented levels.</TE>
<TE>   Now, about 80% of women in Sweden work, which is slightly higher
than the employment rate among men. Women earn about 15% less than
men, but that pay gap is narrowing and it's among the smallest in the
world. The average American woman earns about 22% less than the
average man.</TE>
<TE>   What did Sweden do, and would those actions have a positive effect
in the United States?</TE>
<TE>   Three laws have most affected employment among women in Sweden,
Sahlin said. One that bars discrimination is similar to U.S. laws.
Another mandates that, after the birth of a child, companies give
women as much as six months of leave and men as much as a month. The
third is a law guaranteeing affordable child care for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   The child-care system, which is largely publicly financed,
provides care from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for about $100 a month, Sahlin
said. However, this and other costly public services have pushed the
country's tax rate to 52%. Comparatively, the highest federal
marginal tax bracket in the U.S. is 38.6%. However, state taxes can
push combined marginal rates above 40%, particularly in high-tax
states such as California and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Although affordable child care has made it possible for women to
work, Swedish companies often subvert antidiscrimination laws because
they find the burden of doing without workers for long stretches
onerous, Sahlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The most common question a woman hears when she applies for a job
is, 'Do you want to have children?'" she said. "If you say yes, you
won't get the job. No one asks the man."</TE>
<TE>   If a company employs several young women who have children, the
burden can be particularly great. Some experts say the combination of
Sweden's high tax rate and costly time-off laws deters individuals
from starting new businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Sahlin said the purpose of her trip to the United States was to
better understand what drives so many women to open businesses here.
In Sweden, it is rare for an individual to start a company. In the
U.S., women account for about 25% of business owners and a third of
sole proprietorships.</TE>
<TE>   Sahlin heard many explanations of why American women are
entrepreneurial, including the fact that they were driven to start
their own firms by companies that were unwilling to provide enough
flexibility for women to work and raise a family.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden can't afford to be insensitive to women's needs, however.
Without women in the work force, the country would suffer a serious
labor shortage, Sahlin said. Moreover, if the country is unable to
maintain a strong birth rate, future labor shortages--as well as
systemic problems with the country's retirement system--would be
nearly assured.</TE>
<TE>   Accommodating Women's Dual Roles</TE>
<TE>   No country with a pay-as-you-go retirement system--including the
U.S., with Social Security--can afford to let its population
stagnate. There would be too few workers to support too many
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   "All these companies know about the age of the population and they
know that we have to have people in the labor force in the future,"
Sahlin said. "The only way to do that is to give birth now."</TE>
<TE>   That means the government has to find ways to work with
corporations to accommodate women's dual roles in society.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not an easy balance. "My mother had to fight to get the
right to work," she said. "I have been working all my life, and I had
to fight to get the right to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to convince women that they don't jeopardize their
position in the work force if they have babies. We have to be able to
both work and have children," Sahlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The labor market has to accommodate reality."</TE>

<HD>Small Banks Dodge Woes of Their Big Competitors</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Analyst John Kline loves UCBH Holdings Inc., a San Francisco bank
that caters to Chinese immigrants, but he felt compelled to downgrade
the stock last week. The problem: UCBH has so many admirers that its
shares are up 400% in three years.</LD>
<LD>   "The business fundamentals are impeccable," said Kline, who
follows banks and thrifts for Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners in New York.
"But you have to wonder if they have gotten ahead of themselves" in
terms of their stock price.</LD>
<LD>   The price of success is an issue today for smaller banks, which,
protected by their specialty niches, generally have weathered recent
economic storms far better than big national and regional banks.</LD>
<TE>   An index of small-cap banking stocks climbed 30% during the last
year, compared with a loss of about 1.6% for an index of large banks,
in part reflecting a general shift by investors weary of tech
flameouts and accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "Small-cap value stocks are where the action has been all this
year and part of last year," said Floyd Coleman, portfolio manager
for the AXA Rosenberg small-cap funds, whose holdings include East
West Bancorp Inc. of San Marino, a rival to UCBH for the ethnic
Chinese market.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller financial institutions dominated a recent U.S. Banker
ranking of U.S. banks and thrifts that considered return on equity,
capital, and changes in profits and stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the nation's second-largest bank, came in
last; No. 1 was Doral Financial Corp., a Puerto Rico bank that is
expanding rapidly in Florida and New York.</TE>
<TE>   These small banks tend to focus on specialty markets--in Doral's
case, mortgage lending to Latinos. And they generally avoid buying
into the huge syndicated loans the industry makes to giant
corporations--a specialty that got Morgan in trouble when companies
such as Enron Corp. hit the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Few have been involved in investment banking, high-risk lending to
tech firms or venture capital deals, enterprises that soured last
year at many larger institutions. Some big firms, notably Citigroup
Inc. and FleetBoston Financial Corp., also lost heavily when
Argentine loans and bonds went into default.</TE>
<TE>   Providing More Personalized Service</TE>
<TE>   The result is what Kline calls "a reverse image in the mirror"
from 1998 and 1999, when larger banks were the stars, expanding into
new markets amid financial deregulation and excitement over the "new
economy."</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the strengths and many services large banks provide,
there's a huge demand for institutions that are close to local
customers and more flexible," Irvine banking consultant Norman Katz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Big banks may be tempted to regard the smaller fry "the way you
think of a gnat or a mosquito--as an irritant," Katz said. But the
highly touted attention that Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp.
and others now are paying to the huge Latino market indicates "in
some cases they see these niche players as viable competitors."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, retail giants such as Wells and BofA provide a huge
range of services to customers. The smaller banks must contract with
outside vendors to provide many of these services, and they can't
match some, such as extensive ATM networks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet small banks have been able to keep profits growing by charging
higher fees for more personalized service in niches such as
small-business lending, industry specialization or affluent
individuals, or by catering to specific ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   One standout niche these days is the Asian American market. Shares
in UCBH, the parent of United Commercial Bank, and East West Bancorp
have risen more than 40% over the last year. Cathay Bancorp Inc., the
oldest bank in L.A.'s Chinatown, is up nearly 50%.</TE>
<TE>   During two decades of quiet expansion off the radar screens of
most investors, Cathay and East West have opened Northern California
branches and UCBH has expanded into Southern California. More
recently, the Asian banks have been opening offices and buying banks
in other states and countries.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion outside home markets is "definitely the trend to watch,"
said Martin Friedman, director of research at Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey &amp; Co., an investment banking and money-management firm in
Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to monitor it to see if they can reproduce the quality
outside their natural markets. But it's a good business concept in
general--to take what they've learned from serving their niche and
transfer it to other areas."</TE>
<TE>   Cathay Bancorp, for example, has offices in Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Texas and New York, as well as 12 Southern California and seven
Northern California offices. In January, it won Chinese government
approval to open a representative office in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, the needs of Cathay's customers were
concentrated in the immediate area, said company Chairman Dunson
Cheng.</TE>
<TE>   "Now 90% of our commercial customers are doing business
nationwide," Cheng said. "It's not unusual for them have branches in
Houston or New York City, so we have to follow them."</TE>
<TE>   Cathay, whose specialties include foreign trade financing, has
seen its profit grow at an average annual rate of more than 26% since
the last recession ended in 1995, including a 10% gain last year as
the economy slowed and terrorists struck.</TE>
<TE>   Its assets have grown to more than $2.5 billion--five times more
than what the government considers to be a community bank, though
still dwarfed by mainstream giants such as San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo ($300 billion in assets), or even business and private banking
specialist City National Corp. in Beverly Hills ($10 billion in
assets).</TE>
<TE>   Last month Cathay announced a 2-for-1 stock split, effective
Friday, and a 12% dividend increase--actions that should help attract
new buyers to a company whose stock has been thinly traded, with
little analyst coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Cathay May Be</TE>
<TE>   a Takeover Target</TE>
<TE>   The stock has proved volatile of late, rising from a
split-adjusted price of $36 on April 9 to more than $45 during
trading Monday, before dropping back to close Friday at $42.70, down
43 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Gladue, an analyst who follows companies run by minorities and
women for Chapman Co. investment bank in Baltimore, said the latest
dip probably was triggered by investors collecting profits after all
the positive news.</TE>
<TE>   Gladue, who rated Cathay a "buy" in October when it was trading at
about 40% below its current price, recently downgraded it to "hold"
as the stock price jumped. "I think the company will continue to
perform well," he said. "I just thought it had gotten too high."</TE>
<TE>   Kline, the analyst who downgraded UCBH from "buy" to "outperform"
for similar reasons, offers another possible explanation for Cathay's
volatility.</TE>
<TE>   He believes some investors are speculating that Cathay, which
acquired First Public Savings Bank of Los Angeles in 1996 and Golden
City Community Bank in New York in 1999, may have become a takeover
target itself.</TE>
<TE>   If so, it would be the second longtime minority-owned bank up for
grabs recently in Los Angeles. Black-owned Family Savings Bank in
South Los Angeles began entertaining offers recently after the group
that controls it ran into financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The bidders include Los Angeles-based Founders Bank of Commerce,
which last year merged with Boston Bank of Commerce to form the
nation's first bicoastal African-American bank</TE>
<TE>   Kline said that in Cathay's case, the logical acquirers would
include East West and UCBH, each of which has slightly more assets
than Cathay but more than twice the market capitalization--an
indication of investors' high regard for them.</TE>
<TE>   A key statistic on loan quality shows why. One quick way to judge
a bank's strength is to check the percentage of its loans that are in
default: anything under 1% of all loans and other investments is
generally considered strong.</TE>
<TE>   Cathay's percentage of these so-called nonperforming assets was an
enviably low 0.36% at year end, but East West beat that handily with
a 0.21% ratio.</TE>
<TE>   And at UCBH, the figure was 0.03%, a testament to careful lending
and to the willingness of borrowers to ensure repayment by living "a
step below their means instead of a step above," as UCBH chief
financial officer Jonathan Downing puts it.</TE>
<TE>   Banks such as East West and UCBH have been generating more than
25% annual earnings growth in recent years, compared with 13% to 15%
at well-performing big banks, said Campbell Chaney, a bank analyst
for Sanders Morris Harris in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Word is Out About Small Banks' Stock</TE>
<TE>   East West and UCBH enjoyed growth spurts after going public in
1998, but Chaney thinks they can continue to increase earnings at a
15% to 20% rate.</TE>
<TE>   The small banks understand every nuance of Chinese culture, he
said, and the Asian segment of the population will continue to be the
fastest growing in California.</TE>
<TE>   The downside for investors is that the word is out, so "it's
getting tougher and tougher to find'' attractive small stocks, Chaney
said.</TE>
<TE>   He recently upgraded East West, saying the bank was controlling
costs better and hadn't moved quite so far as UCBH, which he
downgraded as too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   But Chaney and others think investors looking for value may have
to consider bigger banks, such as UnionBancal Corp. and Zions
Bancorporation.</TE>
<TE>   One tough choice as these banks expand is whether to keep playing
to their current strengths or to try to keep their core clientele
while going mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Affluent Counties Remain 'Underbanked'</TE>
<TE>   The latter strategy has become familiar in recent decades to
customers of many Japanese-owned banks, but the classic model was set
by A.P. Giannini, whose San Francisco bank started by catering to
blue-collar Italian immigrants and became Bank of America.</TE>
<TE>   The Great Depression created opportunity for Giannini by reducing
the number of U.S. banks from 64,000 to 31,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Carpenter, head of a boutique Irvine investment bank catering
to small financial institutions, sees a similar opportunity for small
banks today.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter notes that 53% of the institutions operating a decade
ago in California have been submerged in waves of consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the state's most affluent counties, among them San Diego,
Orange, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, are among the most "underbanked,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This disappearance of banks ... allows anyone offering high-level
services and deployed in a local branch system to have very much the
same opportunity as Giannini after the Depression," Carpenter said.</TE>

<LD>While justice may be extracted from former Enron players over the
California energy nightmare, the money lies elsewhere ("Make Enron
Pirates Answer," editorial, May 8). That company squandered its
ill-gotten profits. But one Enron memo said that other market
participants followed the big dog in gaming the power market. AES,
Calpine, Duke Energy, Dynergy, El Paseo Natural Gas, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, Mirant, Reliant, Sempra Energy and
Williams were all players during the 2001-02 electricity and natural
gas debacle. Which of these entities are culpable in the gold rush
that robbed millions of Californians of billions of dollars? What
other pirates helped broadside PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison?</LD>
<LD>   Lest anyone forget, what happened during the manufactured energy
shortage (in winter!) was more than just a massive robbery of an
entire state. Companies went bankrupt, the state's surplus
evaporated, programs went underfunded, the economy turned left, we
had rolling blackouts ... and we're still paying for it. And people
suffered. Class-action lawsuit, anyone?</LD>

<LD>"The Heat's Off" (Opinion, May 5) not only identified the need for
adequate numbers of police officers in any given area, especially
those with gangs, but it also identified the problem that occurs when
those numbers fall woefully short: the increase in crime.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. County Board of Supervisors is calling for a cut of more
than $100 million in the Sheriff's Department budget. If that drastic
cut is approved, it is going to devastate public safety in the
unincorporated areas for which we are responsible. Here's a sampling
of what we will be forced to close:</LD>
<LD>   * The Century Regional Detention Center, which houses about 2,000
inmates daily.</LD>
<TE>   * The Sheriff's Academy, resulting in the suspension of all new
hires and training.</TE>
<TE>   * The Family Crimes Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   * The community policing programs, including our VIDA program for
at-risk youths.</TE>
<TE>   * The hate crimes unit.</TE>
<TE>   * The Safe Streets Bureau, which is our gang unit.</TE>
<TE>   * The Asian Crime Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department has a full complement
of officers in all its units in the unincorporated areas of East Los
Angeles. However, if this budget is passed I will have to make
reductions across the board. For example, I will be forced to take
specially trained deputy sheriffs assigned to our gang units and
reassign them, leaving our streets more vulnerable to gangs as well
as other criminal activities.</TE>
<TE>   We need to do what is right for the nearly 10 million people who
call L.A. County their home. We cannot allow the Sheriff's Department
budget to be cut.</TE>

<LD>Re "Detractors Find Bush Has Issues," news analysis, May 6: Many
thanks to The Times for informing its readers that the president
actively participates in decision-making on foreign policy.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush must be diabolically brilliant to deceive the world
with his veneer of utter simplicity. What genius, to avoid ever
making a coherent statement in public unless it was written down for
him in advance. To think that this brilliant tactician has deceived
potential international foes with a supposed lifetime of partying and
zero intellectual accomplishment, only to be uncovered by a
hard-hitting article in The Times about the inner workings of the
White House. The axis of evil had better not underestimate this
president who, sources reveal, calls key foreign policy advisors more
than once a day.</LD>

<TE>   Doesn't The Times see how pathetic it is to have to write an
article, and even put it on the front page, that says, basically,
"Our president isn't that dumb! Hurray!"</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The United States' decision to "unsign" the International Criminal
Court Treaty does not mean that "unilateralism is back" ("U.S. Quits
Treaty on Global Court," May 7). In fact, the U.S. is leading the way
in international war crimes prosecution by supporting the special
court in Sierra Leone. This type of court is better than the ICC for
addressing such crimes.</TE>
<TE>   First, its location near the scene of the alleged crimes, in
Sierra Leone, affords both the victims and the supporters of the
accused the opportunity to see that justice is done. Second, having
Sierra Leoneans occupy important positions in the court will increase
respect for the law in Sierra Leone and strengthen the institutions
that enforce it. Such goals cannot be addressed by an ICC sitting in
The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   Unilateralism is not back; the U.S. and the other countries that
support the Special Court for Sierra Leone have simply devised a new
and better way to prosecute war crimes.</TE>

<TE>   The Bush administration's bizarre decision to unsign the
International Criminal Court Treaty (which would not have bound us
anyway without congressional ratification) is unbelievably foolish.
Do we really want to be in the company of Libya, the only other
nation on the planet that has consistently opposed the treaty?</TE>
<TE>   When will we, as the world's only superpower, learn that with
power comes responsibility--a responsibility to lead the world, not
retreat from it? Why are we so stupidly stampeding away from the only
place we can truly fight terrorism--the moral high ground of
international cooperation?</TE>

<LD>Re "Blame Has Replaced Understanding," Commentary, May 5:</LD>
<LD>   Rabbi Steven Jacobs' regretful recusal of himself from any further
participation in the Muslim-Jewish Dialogue is a great loss. Jacobs
has been in the forefront of promoting mutual understanding between
Jews and Muslims for many years. That he is dispirited to the point
of dropping out should be a barometer of just how much those
relations have deteriorated in the face of strikes and counterstrikes
between the principals in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   Many progressive Jews apparently jumped off the "mutual respect
and tolerance bandwagon" after the Passover bombing in Israel. That's
a shame, because two vibrant, independent states--one Palestinian,
one Israeli--would go a long way toward alleviating the problem of
terrorism on all sides. That a progressive, "left-leaning rabbi" (his
description) would give up and silence himself is deeply troubling.</LD>

<HD>Controlling Emissions or Just Blowing Smoke?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why is trying to get more gas mileage out of a car or truck anathema
("State's Auto Emissions Bill Is Just So Much Gas," by Benjamin
Zycher, Commentary, May 8)? If the car manufacturers want us to
continue buying SUVs, then they have no choice but to increase
mileage. Otherwise, who will be able to afford the gas to fill them?
The price of gas is hovering around $1.70 a gallon right now.</LD>
<LD>   What is Zycher's answer going to be when it gets to $2 and stays
there? Nuclear power creates the most dangerous form of pollution
known to man. It's called radioactive nuclear waste. Just because it
doesn't come out of a tailpipe or smokestack doesn't mean it's
nonpolluting.</LD>
<LD>   Bob McCall</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having a PhD in atmospheric science, I want to assure Zycher of
the scientific consensus behind predictions of further global
warming. That said, I agree with his opposition to AB 1058. The last
time California tried to "be a leader"--by building only windmills
and solar cells and stalling power plant construction--the state
brought about an energy crisis that Enron exploited but did not
cause. Carbon dioxide emissions will be globally curbed if and when
the warming becomes globally inconvenient and painful. Nuclear power
will then be clearly seen as a lesser evil.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Gerstell</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zycher may be correct in his assessment of California emissions
policy, but to smear people who sincerely want clean air and better
health as "environmental leftists" does not further this debate. If
Zycher walks or bicycles along congested roads, he'll get a lungful
of why we need regulations to curb the poisonous exhaust emissions
from all motor vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Dixon</TE>
<TE>   Malibu</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zycher touts nuclear power to solve emissions problems, but then
your May 8 article ("Nuclear Dump Will Leak, Scientists Say"), points
out that all high-level nuclear waste dumps will have unacceptable
leakage. Needless to say, use of nuclear power has to cease as soon
as possible because of this waste disposal problem, the only
responsible solution to which, unfortunately, has to be
multi-barrier, monitored and retrievable storage for at least 15,000
to 20,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   No burial technique can ever be acceptable, because of basic
engineering principles. All waste containers have to be retrieved and
the waste repackaged whenever leakage occurs, be it in 20 years, 200
years or 2,000 years.</TE>

<LD>Re "Novelist Spurs Passion Over Parking," May 8: I don't care if
Danielle Steel has 26 parking permits or 26,000! Why should I? I
can't park on her street, although she can certainly park on mine.
The whole concept of "permit parking" seems un-American, unfriendly
and unfair. Why should some people have more rights simply because of
their address? These are public roads, for which we all pay taxes.
Permit parking only pushes the parking problem to other
neighborhoods--like mine.</LD>
<LD>   I live in an unrestricted area surrounded by permit parking. As a
result, there is rarely any place for me to park, except several
blocks away. Some folks are now pushing for permits to alleviate this
problem, but such a solution will simply create a problem for someone
else. Eventually every street will have restricted parking and we'll
all be able to park in front of our own homes. Too bad there won't be
anywhere else we can park.</LD>

<LD>Re "No Plans, No Graduation Rite, Seniors Told," May 7: What happened
to freedom of choice? Why should District C Supt. Robert Collins have
the power to decide who will participate in graduation ceremonies
when all the graduation requirements have been met? And who is he to
say that only those who attend college will succeed? Is the L.A.
Unified School District willing to subsidize students who would
choose to enroll in college if they were financially able?</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps if the LAUSD cut the salaries of the administrative staff
it could initiate a subsidy plan for financially needy students.
Illusions such as this, that all children are able and willing to
attend college right after they graduate from high school, abound in
the LAUSD. To encourage children to be dishonest is another story
that might come out of this scheme.</LD>

<HD>She's Got High Hopes</HD>
<DH>Lyricist Sammy Cahn's widow is out to enhance his legacy
her way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tita is in. The widow of the famed lyricist Sammy Cahn is at the door
of her Beverly Hills mini-manse. On the phone as she greets a guest
while directing an offstage servant: "Mahogany," she bellows, arms
waving, "some water for our visitor."</LD>
<LD>   The Cahn house is behind electric gates just steps from Rodeo
Drive, and from the homes of other famous-name wives and widows
who've matured along with the city, which is still Old Hollywood's
boudoir belt.</LD>
<LD>   Today Tita is--for lack of a better word--working. This is nothing
she's been known for. In fact, any fame she garnered in her 22-year
marriage was as a hostess, a fact well-documented in gossip columns
on both coasts.</LD>
<TE>   "She still gives great parties," says novelist Jackie Collins, who
lives a few streets away. "It's like a salon, with fascinating people
and conversation. Michael Feinstein will play the piano, Sean Connery
starts to sing, Tony Danza joins in. She's a fabulous, interesting
character."</TE>
<TE>   "Jackie has no idea what I really do," Tita insists. "Nobody
knows. They all think I'm at leisure because I inherited Sammy's
money." Which she did. But when Cahn died at 80 in 1993, he
unwittingly left her a set of options he never would have offered
while he was living. She has seized them, with the goal of enhancing
his legacy--and her bottom line. In the process, she has caused some
music industry jaws to drop.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, for example, she moved her husband's valuable body of
work from a large international firm, Warner/Chappell, where her
husband had placed it, to the newer, more Tita-friendly DreamWorks
group. She calls it a "traumatic" decision. In fact, all decisions
she makes still amaze her, she says, because in life, Sammy never let
her be involved in his affairs.</TE>
<TE>   To be blunt, which Tita is, "Sammy was a real chauvinist." Not
only wouldn't he have let her take a job if she'd wanted one (which
she didn't), he didn't even allow dissent about daily minutiae. "He'd
say, 'If you want to pick up the tab for our lifestyle, I would be
happy to go where you want to go, see the people you want to see, and
say yes dear, no dear all day long.'"</TE>
<TE>   That was perfectly OK with her, Tita says. She'd never known
another way. "I was an Italian girl from the Bronx who grew up
thinking this was the way it's supposed to be. Sammy was 25 years
older, so he was even more that way. If the guy pays for everything,
why shouldn't the wife be compliant?"</TE>
<TE>   Tita glides into what was once her husband's den (her supple
stride the result of four yoga classes per week, among other ritual
workouts). It is a cozy room with four Oscars on a small table and a
huge mahogany desk, which was once his command post and has now
become hers. Phones to her right, along with every accouterment she
needs to conduct the job she has given herself. And that, quite
simply, is to act as CEO for his valuable body of work, to burnish
its luster and currency wherever, whenever and with whomever she can.
Which is why she's decided to talk to the press.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get me wrong about Sammy," she says. "We were crazy in love
most of the time." Except when they got divorced halfway into the
marriage. "He thought I was spoiled and bratty, which I probably was.
So his business manager called and said, 'My client wants an
expeditious divorce.'" Tita gave him what he wanted, as she always
did, she says. "But then I got what I wanted, which was to get him
back again."</TE>
<TE>   They dated awhile, she moved back in but wouldn't marry him
because "I was getting this huge amount of alimony. Sammy would take
me to dinner, look at my plate and say, 'I'm paying twice for this.'
His sense of humor was great. It was a wonderful time in our lives.
We got to know each other better than ever." They soon remarried.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy took care of his business, and she took care of him--and of
their homes in New York and L.A., and the nonstop social life that
comes with a talented, charismatic guy who was Frank Sinatra's
favorite songwriter. (When he was in his 60s Cahn was voted "best new
talent on Broadway" for a show he wrote and performed featuring his
songs. "He was a firecracker until the end," Tita says. "We'd go to a
party and I'd say, sweetheart, let's go over there where the action
is. He'd say, `Honey, just stand right here and watch the action come
to us.' And it always did."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the usual assets left by wealthy men, Cahn's wife
fell heir to what she calls full control of, and 100% of the income
from the copyrights for his songs, considered to be one of the five
top "standard" catalogs in the world. Songs so entwined in the fabric
of national memory that they float full-blown into mind when just a
few bars are sung. "Come Fly With Me," "My Kind of Town (Chicago
Is)," "Love and Marriage," "It's Magic," "Three Coins in the
Fountain," "High Hopes," "Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!," to
name a few of the hundreds he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Tita emerged from a period of grief and did some "unproductive"
things, only to realize that although she could "easily not work for
the rest of my life," she wanted to work--for Sammy. She would renew
her vows, in a sense, the third time around.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a few years to understand that need in myself," she says.
For the first few years after Sammy's death, things were taken care
of by people who'd worked with him for years. But she received phone
calls regularly from folks who said they wanted to administer Sammy's
catalog, or buy it outright. Some were like ambulance chasers, she
admits, sniffing the scent of profits if they could persuade the
grieving, naive widow to sign on a dotted line. They had no idea who
they were dealing with, she says with a hearty laugh.</TE>
<TE>   She was listening and learning, from the good folks and even from
the con men. "I began to assimilate what I'd heard, to evaluate, to
realize there were things I could do that needed to be done." She
finally took action.</TE>
<TE>   Her first triumph, she says, was to help create a new three-disc
promotional album of Sammy's greatest work (written with Saul
Chaplin, Jule Styne, Nicholas Brodszky, James Van Heusen and others)
as performed by dozens of top artists through the years. Such discs
are not for sale to the public, she explains, because they include so
many artists who recorded for so many companies that it would be
impossible to make deals with them all. So she sends it only to those
who might perform or use Cahn songs on radio, TV, in theater or other
commercial venues. Cahn's previous promotional album--the equivalent
of an artist's portfolio--was on 33 rpm records at the time. "I went
to Warner/Chappell, which administered his music deals and royalties,
and said we should make some changes and put Sammy's album on CD. I
chose what songs, what artists--I plowed through mountains of
material, listening to different versions of his songs, and saying,
'Let's put Peggy Lee in this one, let's do Frank [Sinatra] for that.'</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's a wonderful boxed set, which I sent out last November
and got incredible, unexpected response. Notes and phone calls from
people like Sydney Pollack, Bob Evans, Ron Meyer at Universal, Sumner
Redstone, John Travolta, Sylvester Stallone. Everybody says the same
thing: These songs are part of the American landscape."</TE>
<TE>   She pauses as Mahogany delivers drinks in stemmed glasses on a
silver tray. The phone has rung nonstop in the den, interrupting
Tita's openhearted interview. "No, I can't make it tomorrow," she
tells one friend. "It's my birthday, and I'll be with Irwin and Margo
Winkler and Jimmy Woods." (Winkler's the Oscar-winning film producer;
Woods is the actor.)</TE>
<TE>   Tita, who says friends always knew she was "smart and funny," soon
realized her talents had a wider application. "When Sammy was around,
I never let my smarts show. I thought it was not girlie, not
feminine, that men wouldn't like you if you seemed capable. When he
died, I wanted to do right by him and his songs. And an amazing thing
happened. The things I'd liked least about myself were things that
came to the fore. I didn't have to pretend they weren't there any
more. I liked who I was, I liked that Sammy left me in charge, I
liked sitting in a roomful of men and making the decisions. As
unhappy as I was, I had a goal--to keep his image vital, so his songs
don't just become the brilliant work of a bygone poet. Without me,
people would be dealing with a nameless, faceless estate."</TE>
<TE>   Many thousands, if not millions, have already heard Tita in the
performing phase of her new job. She started making herself available
for TV shows, such as Larry King's, and for late-night radio shows
around the world, on which DJs and hosts play Cahn's songs (from the
new demo album), and Tita talks her colorful talk. "It's fun, and
audiences seem to love it."</TE>
<TE>   She began investigating possible new uses for her husband's work,
much of which she says is as vital as anything around. This may sound
like a stretch, because Cahn's work predates and has little in common
with contemporary pop music, but Michael Feinstein, the concert and
cabaret vocalist who co-owns Feinstein's at the Regency in New York,
says Cahn's lyrics have "as much relevance as Beethoven or
Shakespeare. Great art transcends the time in which it was created.
In fact, I'm always singing Cahn's songs. My new album has one of the
first great torch songs he wrote for Sinatra, with Jule Styne, "Guess
I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry."</TE>
<TE>   (Since Cahn's death, Celine Dion, Garth Brooks, Gloria Estefan,
Diana Krall, and Harry Connick Jr. have recorded Cahn songs, she
says. And in England, Robbie Williams' new hit album features Cahn's
"Ain't That a Kick in the Head.")</TE>
<TE>   Tita says she knew, after Cahn's will was read, that she'd have
some soul-searching to do about how she would carry out "this
tremendous gift and responsibility that he left in my care."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd started listening and fretting the day I was put in charge."
She could do nothing, sell the catalog outright or maybe change
publishers. "Warner's is the biggest. They were doing right by me,
administering and making deals. But there were some great guys at
DreamWorks whom I'd known through the years. Chuck Kaye, who had been
at Warner/Chappell, Dave Geffen and Mo Ostin, (head of DreamWorks
records). I felt comfortable there." Still, she says, it was a
difficult tie to sever. "It became like a divorce--a messy one at
that. At first, when I tried to talk to them, they said things like,
'Don't worry honey, we're taking care of everything.' Can you
imagine? I'm still being called honey and I'm 63 years old? They
didn't want the little woman to interfere."</TE>
<TE>   As things heated up, she says, "they literally stomped their feet
and tried to bully me, telling me I was disloyal, that I could never
come back if I left. It should have been strictly a business thing.
It wound up to be very personal and emotional, with people not
speaking to me. Literally turning away when they see me in a
restaurant. That's still going on. Would they bully Burt Bacharach
like that? Or is it just 'cause I'm a woman?"</TE>
<TE>   The business of administering a catalog such as Cahn's is a
byzantine legal and financial specialty that no layman is equipped to
handle. Deals are made for each song's use in radio, TV, films,
theaters, malls, restaurants, live performance, commercials, etc.,
around the world. Each deal involves determining and collecting
royalties based upon legalities specific to that kind of use and upon
fractional percentages of royalties that must be shared among
lyricist, composer, music publisher, etc. "Even Sammy couldn't have
known if he was getting accurate accounts and the best deals
possible," Tita says. She certainly didn't pretend to be able to
figure it out. She chose DreamWorks and Cherry Lane.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman at Warner/Chappell, who did not want his name used,
says, "It is not unusual for catalogs to move. What was unusual is
that Sammy had been a friend for so many years, there was a very
close relationship and this move was certainly not expected. But his
catalog is not that big, not huge in comparison with George Gershwin,
Cole Porter, Lerner and Loewe or Stephen Sondheim, all of whose work
we represent.''</TE>
<TE>   Tita is livid when she hears his remarks. "He said, 'Not that
big?'" she screeches, practically coming through the phone. "Well,
lemme tell you, if it's not so big, then why did they try so hard to
keep me? I know three catalogs larger than ours. The Gershwin
brothers, because they own words and music. Irving Berlin, who owns
words, music and publishing. And Cole Porter ... " She stops, catches
her breath and laughs. "You see now how protective I am of Sammy. He
got a really hard worker and good advocate when he left me in
charge."</TE>
<TE>   Tita is singing now. Snippets from her husband's "amazing range of
lyrics" tumble out in the throaty warble of a born chanteuse. She is
trying to convey the versatility of her husband's talent. "Can you
imagine that one man wrote 'Come Fly With Me' and 'Be My Love?'"
(popularized by Mario Lanza in the '50s). To another caller, she
gives the go-ahead for a demo tape of music written by Cahn and Jimmy
Van Heusen for the 1955 live TV production of Thornton Wilder's "Our
Town." It starred Frank Sinatra as narrator, with Paul Newman and Eva
Marie Saint. "There's no cast album for that show, for lack of a
better term," she says. "So I've taken the score from the TV tape,
which was full of crackling and noise, and had it enhanced. Then I
will have a soundtrack to take to a producer and say, 'What do you
think? Do you want to do a Broadway production of this?'" Cahn won an
Emmy for "Love and Marriage," one of about a dozen songs written for
that TV show. (The tune later became the theme for "Married ... With
Children.") At this point, Tita is singing the title song to
illustrate just how wonderful it is.</TE>
<TE>   She will leave in two days, she says, for a monthlong business
trip to New York, London and Milan, Italy. In New York, she'll set up
more radio and TV interviews, meet with Broadway producers and people
such as Robert Osborne, a host on Turner Classic Movies network, "who
might do a tribute to Sammy on his birthday" in June. With her friend
Tim Rice, she'll check out a Broadway show about the rock 'n' roll
group Queen.</TE>
<TE>   She seems to have memorized a calendar of meetings in three
countries and two continents, much as she has memorized the phone
number of Claridge's in London, where she's stayed for 20 years and
where she'll meet with people such as Mike Parkinson from the BBC,
who may do a Sunday afternoon show on Sammy with Tita.</TE>
<TE>   Tita walks her guest to the door with a final admonition: "I hope
you will convey the spirit of great love and fun we shared between
us. We were totally crazy about each other. We never said mean things
to each other. The worst he ever said when I was carrying on was: 'If
you are smart, you will desist.' Isn't that great? It used to break
me up. It still does."</TE>

<HD>The Lost Art of the Idle Moment</HD>
<DH>Take 5. Don't fill every empty slot, the experts say. Just
how hard is that?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just what's so urgent?</LD>
<LD>   You have to wonder. Especially when the concert-goer seated across
the aisle can't wait for the music to end to call in a review. He
suddenly lifts his cell phone in the general direction of the stage
then announces: "This is beeee-yooo-tee-ful!" into the tiny
mouthpiece over the thrumming drum and bass.</LD>
<LD>   And what's so crucial that the "business meeting" to settle it has
to take place next to you at the candlelighted trattoria, a 90-minute
shout-fest on a cell phone, full of expletives and wild gestures at
10 p.m. on a Saturday?</LD>
<TE>   Why must the beeper go off during the benediction? And, while
we're at it, what's the deal with the laptop at the movies?</TE>
<TE>   Is all this so pressing that none of it can wait?</TE>
<TE>   In a "multi-tasking" culture that has required us to become
increasingly mentally ambidextrous, it was only a matter of time
before even our in-between moments would become amped-up and
maxed-out.</TE>
<TE>   Think back. Consider the last time you sat in a public space and
just stared into nothingness--no newspaper, cell phone or breakfast
burrito ingredient list to accompany you. The last time you just
lingered. Or wandered. Not asking for the correct time, not tapping
your foot. Just letting your brain take its cool-down lap, allowing
time to unspool and possibility to bloom.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, we Angelenos have been keen to prop ourselves up as
the capital of the open-ended options and unfettered time. The
Southland is dotted with metaphors for the region's half-speed life
and knock-about philosophy, from the happenstance of exotic gardens
in the hidden nook of a foot-trail, to flip-flops. We had so much to
spare. Like the French flaneur, passing the hours pleasantly against
picture-perfect backdrops, we knew that reveling in idle time was not
only a necessity but an art.</TE>
<TE>   And now, it's an art somehow forgotten. As the long, formerly lazy
days of summer approach, it's become increasingly evident that even
laid-back L.A. has become caught up in the willy-nilly push to press
furiously forward.</TE>
<TE>   Lazy bedroom communities once known for their low-gear
distractions--the protracted picnic or the twilight family
barbecue--have been overrun by the increasingly repetitive thicket of
fast-food ghettoes. Worse, they now boast "express" versions of
well-known casual dining restaurants, offering a sort of "greatest
hits" menu, an edited, speeded-up version of themselves for the
go-getter who hasn't the time to suffer the extraneous.</TE>
<TE>   This fast-forward press has even reached what seemed to be the
region's very last outpost of time standing still: the corner Suds
'N' Shine. Once ruled by the pace and sensibilities of sauntering men
in golf caps, Cigarillos and circular conversation, the carwash, too,
has gone the way of the hyperkinetic cyber-cafe, crowded with
screaming cell phones and impromptu meetings on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   In the eight to 12 minutes from vacuum to Armor All, the carwash
was one of the region's best repositories of the beauty of the stolen
moments, a safe tuck-away. It was often christened with some
awkwardly poetic conflation of street names at the nearest
intersection--"The HollyMont" "The GlenMar"--nostalgic labels for a
distinctive oasis. With its murmuring machinery, sighing suds and
cascading water jets, it was as effective as a perfumed day spa or
desert retreat for winding down from a particularly soul-deflating
week.</TE>
<TE>   Suspended between one errand and the next, briefly car-less, the
burdened or the frazzled knew that the carwash provided an alibi--or
at least a respite. It didn't offer quite enough time to dip into a
"pending" file or pull out the papers to grade. It spun out a
meandering string of moments that could be unaccounted for without
guilt or anxiety. The brain was free to happen upon a pool of blank
space, to bask in it, fantasize or meditate, face turned to the sun.</TE>
<TE>   But we wax nostalgic.</TE>
<TE>   As that version of the carwash slips away, so have other similar
pockets in the day: the oil and lube, the Laundromat, the wedge of
time between the popcorn line and the coming attractions. Gyms and
cafes have gone from stop-time islands to workplace annexes. "I don't
get these people with their scripts, on their cell phones with their
lattes, talking about nothing! 'Whatcha doin'? ... Whatcha gonna do
later ...,'" groused one downtown-type frantically looking for a
place to duck out. "They just want to be part of the noise."</TE>
<TE>   Those small scraps of time were the equivalent of a deep breath.
They kept you clear and focused. Objective, if not hopeful. And now
that they've vanished, we buy books telling us how to reinvent them.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take it when you get it," says New York-based writer
Veronique Vienne, author of "The Art of Doing Nothing: Simple Ways to
Make Time for Yourself" (Potter, 1998) and the upcoming, "The Art of
the Moment" (Potter, 2002). "Even if it's 30 seconds. We have the
meter on all the time. We are always counting the minutes. We are
obsessed with production things we 'have to do.' We're under pressure
to conform. And all of it lives under our skin."</TE>
<TE>   Synching up our lives with everyone else's, and just keeping
up--with everything--can easily blur into a full-time pursuit. But
unscheduled time is like an uneasy pause in conversation. People just
can't stand it. "We are afraid to be failures," says Vienne, "but we
have to argue with our guilty feelings."</TE>
<TE>   If time feels different--faster--these days, that's because in
some essential way it is, says L.A.-based psychologist A. Scott
Greer. "One of the things that I see is that the whole concept of
time has changed," he says. "You would write a family member a letter
and say ... 'I'll see you in the spring.' 'I'll see you in a year.'
If you survived disease, the elements, then it was, 'I'll see you at
the end of the month.' Now it's 'I'll see you on Tuesday.' We have
the impression that we, too, must move faster."</TE>
<TE>   But, really, how much faster must we be, asks Greer, who spends a
good amount of time counseling the anxiety-ridden and sleep-deprived:
career-track singles burnt out by voracious overwork and slim
rewards; parents who have figured the answer to their family's
extracurricular activities is not to cut down but chart it all on
Excel spreadsheets.</TE>
<TE>   "When I raise the question of what do you do in your leisure time,
I get a blank look," he says. 'What does that mean?' They've bought
into the advertising. My computer needs to be faster. I need a new
Palm Pilot. I need the DSL line.</TE>
<TE>   But in L.A., especially, if you look at educated, career-oriented
people, they feel they need the neatest, newest, fastest." It's
image, impression, he explains. "People don't know how to sit
quietly. They feel guilty. Patients say they don't want to be
perceived as old-fashioned or lazy. They're worried that they will be
left behind or that their status will go down."</TE>
<TE>   As we master "multi-tasking," we forget that doing five things
simultaneously was once known as "being overwhelmed." Nowadays, if
someone heaves a heavy sigh and says, "I worked two 16 hours days!"
it isn't necessarily a complaint, but might well be an inverted
boast. We define ourselves by the number of hours clocked,
destination points hit, extra errands we can squeeze in--but to what
end?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe today's overreachers are in some way overreacting to early
'90s slackers, those poorly postured shadows in plaid who sat around
with vacant stares. But slacking wasn't necessarily a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   We forget we need to be both busy and idle. "All intellectual
improvement arises from leisure," said the great idler Dr. Samuel
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   And Aristotle, who made a point of pondering, believed that
happiness depends upon leisure. "For we occupy ourselves so that we
may have leisure, just as we make war so that we may live in peace. "</TE>
<TE>   The route back to balance? "Learn to enjoy certain journeys,"
Greer says. "Learn how to do something with your hands. I don't mean
idling in front of the computer screen, or going to the gym [and]
riding the bike reading the Wall Street Journal or watching CNN.
That's really a problem."</TE>
<TE>   And there is a solution. "The issue is not to be so driven and
compulsive about using every moment," says Harriet Braiker, author of
"The Disease to Please: Curing the People-Pleasing Syndrome," (McGraw
Hill, 2000). "You can't possibly keep up. People tell themselves,
'I'll relax after I've finished everything I have to do.' They tell
themselves that downtime is a luxury after you finish. That's a
wrongheaded way. Downtime is what's important to do. We have this
sense that time is precious," says Braiker, and valuing it properly
means realigning our perceptions and seeing the worth of--and
possibilities in--emptiness.</TE>
<TE>   "If you give yourself a little time," says Vienne, "your
subconscious will suggest a solution."</TE>
<TE>   You just have to know where to start.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday morning at a neighborhood Suds 'N' Shine, sure
enough, the breezeway was busy with chino-clad execs clicking through
their online portfolios. Women in sleek Sunday sheaths chattered into
their palms. But holding court, as always, were the Cigarillo guys,
in golf caps and short sleeves, who know that as life hurtles by on
the interchanges and four-levels, there should and will always be a
place to go to study and perfect the art of the lean.</TE>

<LD>Karryn Grossman's students at Pomelo Drive Elementary in West Hills
share some of the things they plan to do for their moms today.</LD>
<LD>   * My mom is going to have a special Mother's Day. I am going to
fix coffee and do the wash. I am going to fix dinner for my mommy.
The salad is going to have lettuce, tomatoes and pine nuts. I hope my
mom feels special. (Maggie, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * I will not fight with my brother so mom won't have to get mad at
us. I will make her a breakfast of eggs, hash browns and bacon. This
will be a fabulous Mother's Day. (Kevin, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * It is my favorite day because I get to make breakfast. I will
make French toast and coffee. I will make dinner for her too. I will
make macaroni and cheese and water. I think my mommy will like
Mother's Day. (Ally, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * I will make her breakfast in bed to help her relax. Next I will
buy her new earrings. She will have a new pair to wear. I want her to
have the best Mother's Day. (Lindsey, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * I will make pretty balloons for her because she likes me to
decorate the house. Second I will make a surprise party for her. I'll
invite my grandma and grandpa, my nanny and her children too.
(McKenzie, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * I'm going to give my mom extra hugs and kisses. That will make
her feel happy. I'm going to help her clean the house. Then she
doesn't have to do a lot of work. I hope she'll have a wonderful
time. (Donald, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * I will give my mother a massage. I'll massage her shoulders so
she can relax. Next I will try to find a crystal for her. She can see
it shine in the morning. Maybe she will like all this. (Ori, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * I will give my mom pictures and other stuff. I will also give
her extra hugs and kisses. When my mom needs a hug or kiss I will
give her one. (Melody, 7)</TE>
<TE>   And Megan, 9, at Page Private School in Los Angeles says she would
like to:</TE>
<TE>   " ... take my mother back to when she was little so she could play
with her childhood friends. She really misses them. I would take her
to play baseball and to Girl Scout camp. I would love to come with
her and we would have lots of fun together."</TE>
<TE>   --Compiled by MARY ELLEN WALKER</TE>
<TE>   Mother's Day is today, and Father's Day is June 16. Can you think
of something really creative or unusual to do for your parent(s) or
guardian(s)? Let us know. See "How to Write to Us" for more

<TE>   by Jon Stone</TE>
<TE>   This book is funny. Grover is afraid of the monster. He tells us
not to turn the pages. He even tries to tie the pages shut. He makes
a brick wall to hold the pages shut. My favorite part is when Grover
yells, "Stop turning pages!"</TE>

matter and also methods to convert from one state to another. Good
book for us kids. Do read it!</TE>

<LD>It wasn't exactly the kind of Mother's Day most of us would
appreciate. Caroline Contreras rose at dawn, filed out of her cell
and lined up with 3,000 other women for breakfast. Then, after a
morning behind bars, she spent the afternoon in a visiting room
patrolled by guards.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't the surroundings or the routine that set the day
apart. It was the presence of Cynthia, the teenage daughter that
Contreras had been separated from for almost half of the youngster's
life. "What a gift," says Contreras, now on parole, looking back on
that prison visit two years ago. "The only thing I can compare to the
emotional joy I felt on that day was the day that Cynthia was born."</LD>
<LD>   And I thought about what used to be my standing request for
Mother's Day: I'd like a little solitude, I used to tell my late
husband. A few hours away from our three kids, who sometimes made me
feel like an inmate on suburban lockdown.</LD>
<TE>   How different this holiday looks to a mother whose view of the
world really is framed by bars.</TE>
<TE>   In her eight years in prison, Contreras saw her daughter just two
times. That's twice more than most of her fellow inmates saw their
children.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 7,300 mothers among the nearly 9,500 women
incarcerated in California. Most are serving their time in Chowchilla
at the Central California Women's Facility and the Valley State
Prison, the world's largest women's prison complex.</TE>
<TE>   They've left behind about 17,000 children, most with relatives or
placed in foster care. More than half never see their kids during
their prison terms.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the children live with grandparents, who are not able,
economically or physically, to get them there," says Sister Suzanne
Steffens, director of Detention Ministry for Los Angeles' Catholic
Archdiocese. The rural California prisons are a five-hour drive from
the urban areas where most inmates come from.</TE>
<TE>   On a visit to the prisons three years ago, Steffens asked the
inmates what the church could do to help ease their time and prepare
them for life on the outside. Bring our children, they said. We need
to see our kids. So the archdiocese rented a bus and took nine sets
of children from Southern California to see their inmate moms two
years ago on Mother's Day. The next year, it was two buses and 20
families. This year, nine buses were scheduled to carry 136 children
from 67 families up and down the state to Chowchilla.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras' daughter Cynthia was part of the original entourage.
When Contreras went to prison eight years ago for robbery, kidnapping
and assault, her daughter, then 11, felt like she'd been sentenced as
well. She spent two years bouncing among relatives, then landed in a
group home in Van Nuys. Mother and daughter kept in touch via letters
and calls, but Cynthia had no way to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing her on Mother's Day two years ago "was like giving birth
all over again," Contreras says. "I couldn't keep my hands off her,
touching her hands, her face, her arms. I wanted to count her
freckles, to feel her hair. I made her take off her socks, 'Let me
see your feet.' I wanted to count her toes, like when she was a baby,
to make sure everything was there."</TE>
<TE>   The visit was no less profound for her daughter, now Cynthia
Boutin, a 19-year-old Navy sailor stationed in Norfolk, Va., with her
Navy husband and 6-month-old daughter. "It felt like a dream," she
says. "I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't believe I was actually
there, face to face, with my mom. I'd wanted to see her for so long."</TE>
<TE>   Those three hours lighted a fire under Contreras. "I realized I
was going to get out of here, and I'd better start thinking about
what I was going to do." She wanted to live up to what her daughter
expected. So she signed up for vocational classes, became a certified
optician and earned a license in air-conditioning repair.</TE>
<TE>   When she was paroled in January, she moved into a Claremont home
run by Crossroads, a program for women parolees. She got a job at an
Upland air-conditioning firm. And she began donating 10% of every
paycheck to the "Get on the Bus" campaign, to help pay for buses,
counselors and lunches for the kids. "That one day changed my life,"
Contreras says. "It made me realize how much I meant to my daughter,
how much I wanted to be there for her."</TE>
<TE>   But while Mother's Day visits are nice, there's more to parenting
than sitting across a table in a visiting room getting reacquainted
with your kids. And a lot more needs to happen all year long if we
want to build ties between mothers and children that are strong
enough to outlast prison terms. After all, most women in prison are
there by dint of bad decisions and selfish choices--not exactly
models of motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Many are two- and three-time losers, drug addicts who move back
and forth between jail and their children's lives. But with support
behind prison walls, latent maternal instincts can survive.</TE>
<TE>   Support, such as parenting classes, to help mothers who've grown
up in unhealthy homes understand what their children need. Drug
treatment. Psychological counseling. And education for women so
academically deficient, many can't even write a letter home. "There
are so many women in there who want to be good mothers, want to stop
using drugs, want to be productive citizens, but they don't know
how," Contreras says. "All they know is what they've always done. And
their kids grow up angry, feeling unloved, because their mothers
don't know how to show that they care."</TE>
<TE>   She knows that some folks believe mothers in prison don't deserve
the privilege of parenting. "I understand that feeling," she says.
"But it's not so much about what we deserve as what the children
deserve. They don't see their mothers as bad people. They just know
they miss their moms.... They're being punished when we're the ones
that did wrong."</TE>

<LD>Represented by her good friend Lord Cecil Parkinson, former British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received Chapman University's Global
Citizen Medal at an on-campus benefit in Orange that raised $460,000
for student scholarships.</LD>
<LD>   Ill health prevented Thatcher from attending the black-tie gala
attended by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and U.S.
Ambassador to Spain George Argyros in the Hutton Sports Center.
"She's been a little under the weather, but she's still in great
form--full of ideas and enthusiasm," said Parkinson, once Thatcher's
trade minister. "I will take the medal to her when I visit her in
London next week."</LD>
<LD>   Thatcher's courageous leadership helped bring about "the end of
the Cold War and the downfall of communism," Chapman President James
Doti said. "She is one of the great leaders of our time."</LD>
<TE>   About 400 guests gathered for a cocktail reception and formal
dinner at the May 4 event, which capped a four-day university
symposium on Thatcher's administration.</TE>
<TE>   Guests also included gala co-chairmen Paul Folino and Mark
Johnson, and Julia Argyros, Lord Nigel Lawson, Lynne Doti, Barbara
Johnson, Betty and Sir Eldon Griffiths, Don and DeeDee Sodaro and Doy

<TE>   Garden Party</TE>
<TE>   The sun broke through the clouds just in time to bring the bonnets
out for alfresco events in the San Gabriel Valley last weekend. The
Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden staged its annual fund-raiser, Garden
With a View, on Sunday. The botanic garden has been the "Noah's Ark"
for California's botanical heritage for 75 years. A haven for the
state's indigenous plants, it was established by Susanna Bixby Bryant
in 1927 in Santa Ana Canyon and relocated to its 86-acre home in
Claremont in 1951. More than 200 people were on hand to celebrate the
garden's 75th anniversary at an afternoon party staged in its
California Courtyard, where each table held a basket filled with
wildflowers from the garden.</TE>
<TE>   Actress and avid gardener Rene Russo served as honorary chairman
of the benefit, which raised $40,000 for community education
programs. "I discovered this place about five years ago, while
re-landscaping my home," said Russo. "That's when I became passionate
about native plants because we've pretty much destroyed our natural
heritage in California."</TE>
<TE>   Several in the crowd took their cue from the invitation and
arrived in vintage '20s costume, including Pamela Harrell, who
portrayed Bryant, and Bob Spencer, who served as auctioneer. Others
on hand included garden executive director Clem Hamilton, Stephanie
Davis, Jim Coffman, Doris and Peter Drucker, Theresa and Gil
Resendez, Adan Ortega, Alice and Mel Clark, Jean and Joe Platt, Maria
and Richard Grant, Gail and Hank Riggs, Barbara Stanford and Barbara
Hughbanks.</TE>

<TE>   Saluting Visionaries</TE>
<TE>   Dining at tables decorated with colorful scarves made by women in
Afghanistan, more than 400 guests attended the Faces of Courage gala
on Monday. It raised $150,000 for World Vision, a nonprofit
organization that provides emergency relief and aid to 80 million
people worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Humanitarians Mary MacMakin and Dan Simmons were recognized at the
event for their work with impoverished people in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Since she left the United States for Afghanistan in 1961, MacMakin
has founded underground schools for girls and spearheaded the
development of income-producing projects and health clinics. "Now I
mainly find ways to help people make a living," said MacMakin, who
topped her gala ensemble with a vest embroidered by an Afghan woman.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons, who was unable to attend the fund-raiser, is director of
World Vision in Jerusalem, where he has worked for 25 years as an
advocate for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Woodstra was chairwoman of the benefit, which was
sponsored by the Orange County Chapter of Women of Vision, a World
Vision support group.</TE>

<TE>   Cornerstone Cottage</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Junior League of Pasadena cut the ribbon to open
Cornerstone Cottage, its new community resource center across from
northwest Pasadena's Madison Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 attended the May 4 block party featuring mariachi
music, folklorico dancers from the school and fiesta food. In the mix
were local pols Carol Liu, Adam Schiff, Jack Scott, Sid Tyler, Victor
Gordo, Chris Holden, Cheryl Hubbard and Juana Cuiriz, the school's
principal, who said, "This is a new beginning for a forgotten
neighborhood. Renovating the property is a dream come true." Among
the programs planned at the cottage are parent support groups and
English as a second language, computer and job training classes.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena Junior League has, over the past five years, invested
28,000 volunteer hours and raised $1.5 million for the school and
surrounding area, including the cottage.</TE>

<TE>   Derby Day</TE>
<TE>   Frosty mint juleps, Kentucky ham, red-eye gravy and biscuits,
sweet potato casserole, collard greens and bourbon-laced pecan pie
were on the menu for the Kentucky Derby Day benefit for the Pasadena
Boys &amp; Girls Club at Santa Anita Park. Henry Williamson, who served
as chairman, is the third generation of his family to be involved in
the event, which raised more than $45,000. "Ten months ago I joined
the board, and they made me fund-raising chairman," said Williamson.
"Then they told me 'We need a fund-raiser,' so welcome to the party!"
More than 250 guests--many in Derby Day millinery--turned out for the
bash held in the track's enormous Front Runner Restaurant, where they
bid on auction items while watching the Hollywood Park and Churchill
Downs cards on closed-circuit television.</TE>

<TE>   Italian Heritage</TE>
<TE>   The award was nice, but Enzo Torresi was more excited about the
birth of his first granddaughter: "She obliged me by arriving
yesterday so I could be here tonight," said the Silicon Valley
entrepreneur. "Her name is Lola. And whatever Lola wants, Lola is
going to get!"</TE>
<TE>   Torresi, managing partner of the venture capital company myQube
USA, was honored for special achievement in technology by the
National Italian American Foundation at its West Coast Gala Dinner at
the Beverly Hilton on May 2. Torresi faced a battery of cameras like
a seasoned pro with fellow honorees actor Nicolas Cage and
writer-director Garry Marshall. "This is kinda fun," whispered
Torresi. "Maybe I'll take up show business in my second life."</TE>
<TE>   Cage was the first inductee into the foundation's Hall of Fame,
and Marshall was recognized with the Career Achievement Award. Jack
Valenti served as honorary chairman of the event, which benefited the
foundation's education fund.</TE>

<TE>   Magic Hours</TE>
<TE>   Dan Tana opened his West Hollywood eatery at high noon last Sunday
to host a luncheon to support "Magic Hour," a documentary film being
made about the Motion Picture and Television Fund's Country House and

based on the research of Theodore Thomas, son of legendary Disney
animator Frank Thomas, and co-produced by Gabrielle Tana, Carolyn
Marks Blackwood and Susie Landau Finch, daughter of Barbara Bain and
Martin Landau. With his four-figure bid, the winner at a benefit
auction to have a Dan Tana menu item named after him was Michael De
Luca, Dreamworks' production chief. As in "Chicken Romano a la

<TE>   The annual do (a perk for members who support the Huntington with
an annual donation of $2,500) featured tastes of Cinco de Mayo
created by Sodexho--empanadas, taquitos, shrimp tacos and tamales
with sangria and margaritas to wash it all down.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Garden curator Clair Martin was on hand to preside over his
array of blooms--about 4,000 plants, arranged chronologically to
trace the history of the rose over 2,000 years. His pride is the

statue titled "Love, the Captive of Youth" enshrined in an 18th

<LD>"Dad," Rachel asked, "what are you making for Mother's Day breakfast
this year?"</LD>
<LD>   "I know," said Rachel's brother Matt. "I made the menu to put on
Mom's tray."</LD>
<LD>   He showed it to Rachel. Then he put it on the tray.</LD>
<TE>   "All right, kids," their father said as he put a cup of coffee on
the tray. "Here's Mom's coffee. Tell her that breakfast will be ready
in 15 minutes. Matt, you carry the tray."</TE>
<TE>   Matt and Rachel put presents on the tray too.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother sat up in bed and looked at the tray Matt put on her
lap.</TE>
<TE>   "Presents!" she said. "How nice."</TE>
<TE>   Then she picked up the menu. "What is this?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's today's breakfast menu," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is a crossword puzzle!" his mother said. "And there
aren't any clues!"</TE>
<TE>   "I'll give you the clues, Mom," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I'll help with the answers," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "All right," their mother said. "But I need a pencil."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel gave her one.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the first clue," Matt said. "No. 1, across. Bread that's
sometimes burned."</TE>
<TE>   Their mother laughed. Then she printed t-o-a-s-t in the spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Next clue," Matt said. "No. 2, down. Round, flat meats that are
good for breakfast."</TE>
<TE>   "I like those," their mother said. She printed "sausages" where it
belonged.</TE>
<TE>   Then she said, "I'm ready for the next clue."</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Matt said. "No. 3, across. Something that tastes good
on toast."</TE>
<TE>   "Jelly!" Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother looked at the puzzle. "That doesn't fit," she said,
"but 'jam'</TE>
<TE>   does." And she  printed the letters  in the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "Next clue," Matt  said. "No. 4, across. A melon that's green
outside and inside."</TE>
<TE>   Their mother counted the  spaces. Then she printed the</TE>
<TE>   answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the last clue," Matt said. "No. 5, down. Hens lay them."</TE>
<TE>   "That's easy!" Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother nodded and printed the answer in the proper spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to be a delicious breakfast!" she said.</TE>

<DH>Carrie Buck's case led to thousands of forced
sterilizations in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH BLUM</AU>
<BD>Deborah Blum is a Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer
and author of "Sex on the Brain: The Biological Differences Between
Men and Women."</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Most historical highway markers slide into the ground without
ceremony. The governor does not issue formal apologies in connection
with their dedications. Crowds do not gather 'round. University
professors do not make impassioned speeches. The national media do
not cover the installation.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, most highway markers do not tell the story of Carrie
Buck, who was ordered sterilized by government officials in her home
state of Virginia, setting off a nationwide campaign to prevent
"undesirable" people from reproducing.</LD>
<LD>   In Buck's case, you could argue that all the fuss and the speeches
and the brand-new apology were long overdue. And nowhere near enough.
The small marker was placed in Virginia. But there are 32 other
states--including California--where state officials would do well to
acknowledge, for the same reasons Gov. Mark Warner did, that "We must
remember ... past mistakes in order to prevent them from recurring."</LD>
<TE>   These were no small mistakes. They include an infamous decision by
the U.S. Supreme Court, Buck vs. Bell. The ceremony earlier this
month was timed to the 75th anniversary of that May 2, 1927,
decision. There's scientific arrogance in this story, as well as
abuse of governmental power on a breathtaking scale.</TE>
<TE>   But let us begin small. Let us begin with little Carrie Buck,
described by those who knew her as shy and sweet and eager to please,
and by our highest court as a second-generation imbecile.</TE>
<TE>   She was born in Charlottesville, Va., in 1906, the out-of-wedlock
daughter of a welfare mother. She had big, dark eyes, a round,
serious face, always neat clothes. As a teenager, she was placed with
a foster family and raped by a member of that family. The rape
resulted in a pregnancy. At age 17, she had a baby daughter she named
Vivian, who was herself placed with a foster family.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, as if things weren't bad enough, Buck caught the
attention of people in power in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The eugenics movement was at its strongest then. The theories of
eugenics are loosely grounded in genetics, in the idea that we are
determined by our genes and that some of us (read: those in power)
have better genes than others do. Therefore, eugenicists concluded,
our leaders should improve society by removing substandard humans
from the gene pool. The movement's list of defective humans included
beggars, tramps, alcoholics, prostitutes, the shiftless, criminals,
the physically deformed, the blind and deaf, and epileptics. It also
included anyone they considered stupid. You could get on the "stupid"
list by being, say, black or an American Indian. Or in Buck's case,
being what Virginia authorities called poor white trash.</TE>
<TE>   The state drafted a compulsory sterilization law for such
lowlifes. The only hitch was that state courts had not been
sympathetic to such laws. So eugenicists wanted to trump the lower
courts. The timing was perfect for a national validation. Oliver
Wendell Holmes was chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. And, as
University of Chicago law professor Albert Alschuler points out,
there was no more ardent eugenicist to be found. Holmes'
correspondence includes suggestions that low-IQ babies simply be
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia authorities decided that Buck could be set up as a
challenger to the sterilization law. They ran her and her mother
through IQ tests and--surprise!--both failed. (Years later, Buck was
retested by more objective testers and scored well within the range
of average intelligence.) They recruited eugenicists from New York to
testify that Buck's child was subnormal as well, although the girl
later became an honors student in elementary school. Then, once they
had the "evidence" that she needed to be sterilized, they put her
name on a lawsuit against the state, designating her the official
challenger to the sterilization law.</TE>
<TE>   And so Buck vs. Bell went straight from the state of Virginia into
the waiting arms of the U.S. Supreme Court. The court declared that
the government had the absolute power to regulate reproduction: "The
principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to
cover cutting the fallopian tubes," wrote Holmes in his majority
opinion. He then explained further: "It is better for all the world,
if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or
to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those
who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.... Three
generations of imbeciles are enough."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court has never reversed the ruling. It still is
cited occasionally as a precedent in the government's power over
reproductive rights. Buck was the first person sterilized under the
state law. Approximately 8,000 others, both male and female, would
follow in Virginia. Nationwide, officials ordered some 60,000
compulsory sterilizations, continuing into the late 1970s. Some
20,000 of those were in California. The "model" laws of the United
States were adopted, with open admiration, by the Nazi government of
Germany, which ordered hundreds of thousands of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Buck died alone, still poor, in 1983. Her bright little daughter
died of an infection at age 8. Buck tried for years to have another
child; the state authorities had not explained her operation any more
than they had clarified her role in their self-serving lawsuit. "I
don't think she ever fully understood what had happened to her," says
University of Virginia law professor and bioethicist Paul Lombardo.
"But there's no doubt that she got the shame." When Virginia
journalists talked to her, not too long before her death, Buck (then
with the married name of Detamore) was terrified of making state
authorities angry. "I'm not going to get in trouble, am I?" was her
first question. She wasn't angry, she said. She didn't believe in
holding grudges. She thought politeness and kindness were the best
way to get through life.</TE>
<TE>   To her credit--and ours--she has had some excellent champions in
recent years. Lombardo, an expert in the history of eugenics, has
been standing up for Buck for almost two decades. It's due to him
that the marker says explicitly that "evidence eventually showed that
Buck and many others had no 'hereditary defects.'" Bioethicists
around the country have railed against eugenics. The Richmond
Times-Dispatch published a powerful investigation of Virginia's
eugenics record more than two years ago. In response, the state
General Assembly passed a resolution of "profound regret." During the
recent gubernatorial election, all candidates promised to
apologize--thus Gov. Warner's May 2 repudiation of Virginia's past.</TE>
<TE>   Buck herself would undoubtedly have traded her place in history
for a home with children, the one she might have had without so much
official attention. Her life could be seen as a testament to the
blessings of anonymity--that is, if we decided to advocate hiding as
a way of life. Instead, fortunately, we assume in this country that
all of us have the right to step out into the light, to have our
chance at the ordinary pleasures of family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Buck's story reminds us in the most direct way what can happen
when our leaders assume that these basic rights and pleasures belong
only to most of us, when they take what Lombardo calls a
"governmental position of contempt for people who are poor or
uneducated or disabled." University of Wisconsin-Madison bioethicist
Daniel Wikler sums it up like this: "In each case, the victims were
those who were stigmatized and disvalued and who could not fight
back." He argues that the moral is not specific to eugenics or
genetics: "The lesson of Buck vs. Bell, it seems to me, is that human
rights are for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   So let us hope that the apologetic pomp and circumstance of the
Virginia ceremony earlier this month foretells a trend in publicly
rejecting Buck vs. Bell. There could even be a few more markers. We
could use one in California, which, after all, had more than its
share of Carrie Bucks. In this case, redundancy is a virtue. We
cannot prove too many times that we really do learn from past
mistakes.</TE>

<AU>ANN CRITTENDEN</AU>
<BD>Ann Crittenden is the author of "The Price of
Motherhood: Why the Most Important Job in the World Is Still the
Least Valued."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>There are so many things wrong with the way the media cover women's
issues that it's hard to know where to begin. But why not with
Exhibit A, the recent stampede to sensationalize the non-news that
there are disproportionately few mothers among higher-earning women.</LD>
<LD>   This bombshell was reported by Sylvia Ann Hewlett in her recent
book "Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest for
Children," which has been breathlessly featured on "60 Minutes" and
"The Oprah Winfrey Show," as well as in the weekly news magazines. A
survey conducted by Hewlett found that one-third of women with high
salaries were still childless at age 40. This has been interpreted as
a tragedy that women can best rectify by planning early marriage and
childbearing, before they wake up one day and find
themselves--gasp--too old to bear fruit and find happiness.</LD>
<LD>   Note that this issue is not about fertility per se. It is about
how hard it is to be a mother and have a well-paying job. These are
two different things. I myself had a baby at 44, and nothing could
have been easier. What was tough was balancing my desire to spend
some meaningful time with my child against my desire to keep my
high-powered, all-consuming job. I couldn't do both, and in the end I
quit my job.</LD>
<TE>   Other women facing similar dilemmas give up the idea of having
children. This is the extreme, all-or-nothing choice facing many
educated American women, and there is absolutely no evidence that
having a baby sooner will enable you to wiggle out of the
career-family conflict. What we do know is, the earlier a woman
marries and has kids, the lower her lifetime earnings will be and the
greater her risk of divorce and poverty. So much for the advice to
find a mate and procreate before it's "too late."</TE>
<TE>   This is not to deny the reality that it does become harder for
many women to become pregnant past a certain age. But does that mean,
as Hewlett and the media would have it, that all those childless
women are miserable? Haven't we come further than that? Thirty years
into a highly successful women's movement, do we really still believe
that a woman can only be fulfilled by becoming a mother? I have many
friends who have never had children and they are at least as happy
with their lives as the mothers among us.</TE>
<TE>   One of my childless buddies is a vivacious financial whiz who is
active in women's issues and cultural affairs in Washington,
D.C.--and married to a gorgeous, supportive guy. Another is a
50-year-old investment banker, a merry widow with a duplex
overlooking the East River in Manhattan and a highly satisfying job
that frequently takes her to South America. The other night we went
to the theater, and her car and driver picked us up, took us to a
restaurant for dinner and then home to our respective apartments. If
these high-earning women are miserable, they sure have me fooled. And
what about Oprah, who, after a miscarriage in her teens, went on to
become the most famous childless career woman of our time? Do you
want to bet that she cries all the way to the bank?</TE>
<TE>   As a matter of fact, several "60 Minutes" producers called me to
discuss this childless career woman phenomenon and asked me to
suggest some people they might interview. I gave them the names of my
two friends, and both later told me that they were called.
Ultimately, though, they were told they would not be used--because,
as one put it, she was "too happy." So much for simplistic sound-bite
sociology.</TE>
<TE>   But the worst thing about this latest attempt to spread fear and
panic among accomplished young women is that it drops a systemic
problem at their feet and says, "You solve it." This is what
professor Robert Drago of Penn State University calls "social science
backwards." First, you identify a problem that is widespread and
therefore not the result of individual, feckless behavior, and then
you urge individuals to change their behavior, leaving the system
intact. This, as Drago put it in a recent group e-mail, is "bad
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   While Hewlett does offer some suggestions for reform--like curbing
long work hours by requiring employers to pay overtime to almost all
employees--apparently it is too much to ask the media to give us the
"good stuff." They rarely explore the reasons American women face
such harsh, either-or choices between children and well-paying
jobs--choices that women in some other countries do not have to face.
I spent almost two weeks in Sweden while reporting a book on the
economics of motherhood. Childlessness is far lower there, because it
is much easier for Swedish women to combine work and family than in
the United States. Mothers (and fathers) in Sweden have the right to
generous paid parental leave, the right to shorter workweeks until
their children reach school age, much greater access to good child
care and a culture that does not demand a monastic (or locker-room)
dedication to the office. An employee's love of family doesn't have
to be hidden like an extramarital affair. These are the factors that
have been shown, in country after country, to reduce childlessness
(although they do not seem to boost the number of children a woman
has).</TE>
<TE>   Swedish feminists and economists also convinced me that these
child-friendly policies do not prevent ambitious women from rising to
prominence. Almost half the members of the Swedish parliament are
women, as are a high percentage of local government officials, and
the percentage of women in high corporate positions is very similar
to the percentage in the U.S.--low in both cases. (In 2000, women
constituted 4% of the top earners in Fortune 1000 companies, and 7%
of the next tier of high earners in the same corporations. Clearly,
American women are not gaining top corporate jobs in return for
giving up those children.)</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that the time clock of corporations and other
institutions is easier to change than the biological clock. So let's
stop obsessing on the latter and start focusing on the real problem:
workplace rules that are out of sync with the rhythms of human
reproduction.</TE>

<HD>Bosnia 10 Years Later Is a Broken Country</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DEVOSS</AU>
<BD>David DeVoss , East-West News Service editor, regularly
visits Bosnia, where he formerly ran a print-media development
program for the U.S. Agency for International Development.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Western democracies, Bosnia was the first test of the "new world
order." By working together, Europe and the United States not only
would heal the wounds of war but also transform the country's
crumbling socialist infrastructure into a modern capitalist state
suitable for inclusion in the European Union.</LD>
<LD>   The Dayton accords, signed in December 1995, appeared to provide
all the tools necessary to complete the job. Protected by a NATO-led
military force, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees
would return displaced people to their homes. The U.N. mission would
reform local police forces, while the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe supervised honest elections. Executive
authority was given to an Office of the High Representative, which
would implement the peace plan agreed upon by all donor nations.</LD>
<TE>   Ten years after the war started, the guns in Bosnia are silent but
the promise of peace has not been redeemed. Though more than $6
billion has been invested in the country, Bosnia-Herzegovina remains
the poorest country in Europe. One family in eight in the country's
Muslim-Croat Federation earns enough for a reasonable standard of
living. The situation is worse in the Bosnian Serb entity, Republika
Srpska, where one in 25 families lives above the poverty line. Half
the population is unemployed, and those who do have jobs earn an
average of $115 a month, about half of what it takes to feed a family
of four.</TE>
<TE>   One measure of the country's desperation is the lines of young
people applying for visas outside foreign consulates. One diplomat
estimates that 20,000 educated young people are waiting for
immigration approval. Under international supervision,
Bosnia-Herzegovina's future has become so bleak that a recent census
found that the country's population has dropped 10% over the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the country's gross domestic product is estimated to
be $4.6 billion. This translates into a per capita income of slightly
under $1,200. But nearly all the economic activity comes from foreign
aid or employment with international development agencies. Were
foreign assistance excluded, Bosnia would have recorded economic
growth of minus 2% last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of the High Representative has the authority to
administer the country by fiat, but it rarely takes unilateral
action, preferring to work in concert with elected officials.
Unfortunately, most of Bosnia's leaders are the same politicians who
supported the war and continue to profit from political chaos. Nearly
all of Bosnia's cantons are fiefdoms in which politicians, backed by
criminal gangs, corrupt judges and lethargic police, have frustrated
refugee resettlement, prevented banking reforms and largely halted
privatization.</TE>
<TE>   "Balkan mafias won't be eradicated until you have the rule of law,
trust of the government, an independent judiciary and uncorrupt
officials," says Louise Shelley, director of the Transnational Crime
and Corruption Center at American University. "The mafia in Bosnia is
not like the Corleone family. It's the banks, the government and all
the layers of society that benefit from corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia is not alone when it comes to crime. Montenegro has no
extradition treaties with the West, making it a valuable transport
hub for contraband. According to the Brussels-based International
Crisis Group, crime is so rampant in Albania that most of the
population is "demoralized and apathetic toward the very concept of
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   What makes Bosnia different is that its corruption is based on
institutionalized xenophobia. Rubble still covers more than 50% of
Mostar because Croat-controlled West Mostar refuses to form a unified
government with Muslim-Slav Bosniaks in the eastern part of the city.
Despite constant pressure from the U.N., it took three years to
integrate the police and fire departments. Croats still refuse to put
their trash in a dump containing Muslim garbage. Last year, the World
Bank almost recalled a $12-million grant to rebuild the water system
installed by the Austrians in 1873 after Croats threatened not to
drink from pipes that also carried water to Muslim households.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in an effort to reduce ethnic tension, the Office
of the High Representative ordered that all ethnically offensive
words in school textbooks be blacked out. Marked for elimination were
the words "grand Serbian aggressors" that appeared beneath the
picture of an amputee. But instead of using black markers, many
teachers in West Mostar's elementary schools highlighted the words in
yellow.</TE>
<TE>   "Herzegovina could be prosperous if it were fully integrated into
Bosnia," says Rubina Khan, U.N. civil affairs coordinator for the
Mostar region. "But politicians prefer this netherworld existence
because they profit from an economy based on black-market liquor,
cigarettes and stolen Mercedes sedans."</TE>
<TE>   How long should the U.S. maintain a military presence in Bosnia?</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld hinted that
perhaps it was time for NATO's European members to assume more of the
responsibility for peacekeeping. The Sept. 11 attack and the
subsequent search for European allies in the war on terrorism
postponed serious debate on the question. But given a new list of
priorities that now includes homeland defense, the issue undoubtedly
will be raised again by those in the Pentagon who believe that the
NATO-led force easily could survive the departure of the 2,500 U.S.
soldiers stationed outside the city of Tuzla.</TE>
<TE>   Some policy analysts in Washington think the force, as it's
currently constituted, has outlived its usefulness and should be
replaced with something similar to Italy's Carabinieri or Spain's
Guardia Civil, national police forces under joint civilian and
military control. Certainly, it no longer intimidates the rent-a-mobs
that Bosnia's nationalists use to express displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   Even when prepared, the stabilization force often refuses to act.
In Herzegovina, 30 armored vehicles belonging to NATO's Quick
Reaction Force were standing by last spring when a team of U.S.
auditors raided a Bosnian bank suspected of criminal connections. But
when a mob of angry skinheads appeared and the Americans radioed for
rescue, the Spanish and Italian commanders in charge of the convoy
refused to intervene, explaining that restrictive rules of engagement
imposed by their governments superseded any order from NATO's local
commander.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia may be a problem for Europe, but a strong argument can be
made for continued U.S. engagement. Many of the moujahedeen invited
to Bosnia a decade ago moved to Albania after the Dayton accords to
help train the Kosovo Liberation Army.</TE>
<TE>   Today, some of these same men continue to fight alongside Albanian
rebels in Macedonia. Some Western intelligence analysts believe that
a decade of conflict in Bosnia, Kosovo, southern Serbia and Macedonia
may have produced a core of 10,000 Albanian Muslims with significant
military experience. If they are correct, the U.S. may discover that
Bosnia's recalcitrant Croats and Serbs are the least of their
problems.</TE>

<AU>HERBERT GOLD</AU>
<BD>Herbert Gold is a novelist living in San Francisco.</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Recently a group of Bay Area "human shields" flew to Israel with the
intention of standing between the Israeli and Palestinian forces in
order to stop the fighting. One of them is a friend of mine, a
longtime pacifist, now outraged that the Israeli authorities shipped
the human shields back to San Francisco before they could carry out
their mission.</LD>
<LD>   They had planned to go to Ramallah and Jenin, wherever the Israeli
army was battling Palestinians. My friend believed the Israelis would
not have shot them because, as she put it, "It would be bad
publicity."</LD>
<LD>   How many of you human shields, I asked, were heading for Jaffa
Road in Jerusalem, where there have been four suicide bomb attacks?
Or to the nearly deserted cafes, restaurants, pizzerias and shopping
malls of Haifa, Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities to protect Israeli
children and other civilians against gunmen and suicide bombers? She
looked surprised. "None," she said.</LD>
<TE>   I asked if this was because the suicide bombers would not be
deterred by the sight of Americans and the prospect of bad publicity.
Irked, she offered the first answer that occurred to her: "So I
suppose you think it was perfectly OK to bomb Afghanistan and Iraq? I
happen to have been told on good authority there are still American
soldiers fighting in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   In the clashing of gears between us, she seemed to notice that
several items here had not meshed.</TE>
<TE>   She must have heard what I said after all. She remarked that she
wished she had thought of raising the issue of the protection of
Israeli civilians, although she doubted the human shield tour group
would have supported such an idea. The trip was sponsored by the Iman
Network, a pro-Palestinian group. So the idealistic American human
shields were acting on behalf of the intifada.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, in a hotel bar in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, I was
watching a CNN report on the war in Afghanistan intercut with footage
of the World Trade Center collapsing. The man on the bar stool next
to mine burst out: "Osama didn't do it." (He was evidently on
first-name terms.)</TE>
<TE>   I turned to him and asked: "Then who did?"</TE>
<TE>   He explained that he was an independent thinker; he knew who had
arranged the flights into the twin towers. "Who?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   His eyes on mine, narrowed, challenging, full of resentments,
telegraphed the rest of our conversation. "A foreign intelligence
service."</TE>
<TE>   "OK," I said, not really needing much more explanation, "how did
Mossad convince 19 Arabs, 15 of them Saudis, to commit suicide?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer was clipped and familiar: "Money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I shared this anecdote about paranoia with my pacifist human
shield friend and asked her what people should do when attacked by
their enemies. "Sit down," she suggested--although we were already
sitting--"and try to figure out why everybody hates us. Why don't we
just sit down and ask ourselves what was in the minds of the people
who commandeered those planes?"</TE>
<TE>   I assured her that many before us had already sat down and
wondered. Yes, they hate America, they hate Jews, they hate all
infidels--Christians, Hindus, even modern-minded followers of Islam
with their own objections to murder. So now that we have sat and we
have pondered, can we stand up and respond?</TE>
<TE>   Later, when I telephoned my friend to apologize for upsetting her,
and to tell her that I saw the hurt in her eyes, and to share with
her the hope that people could stop killing each other, she said she
appreciated my peacemaking efforts. She added: "I wish I had asked
the group why we didn't offer to be human shields for the Israelis
too. I wish I had thought of that."</TE>
<TE>   Evidently Israel needs to provide for its own defense, without the
help of human shields. The herd of independent minds, some of them
believing that the American army is still in Iraq, some of them
convinced that the wily Israelis know how to pay Arabs to create
havoc in America, don't have a solution to the tragic quarrel among
two peoples with justice in both their causes.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, human shields who only protect one side provoke
only dismay. Although the trip my friend joined was financed by
Palestinian activists, the pain in her past and present is
nonsectarian.</TE>

<AU>JOHN H. McWHORTER</AU>
<BD>John H. McWhorter is a senior fellow at the Manhattan
Institute and an associate professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley.
He is the author of "The Power of Babel."</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Remember Franklin in the "Peanuts" comic strip? In the wake of the
criticism of mainstream popular culture for depicting a "whitewashed"
world, Charles Schulz followed a trend by introducing this little
fellow in 1968. But what was Franklin "like"? Charlie Brown was a
loser, Lucy was bossy, Snoopy was insane--but Franklin was, well,
"black." One of the TV specials had him giving Charlie Brown "five"
once. But overall, Franklin had no personality traits at all. Beyond
the tint required to render his skin tone, Franklin was a blank.</LD>
<LD>   Schulz meant well. But Franklin was a classic "token black," and
that era saw more than a few Franklins. Archie comic books introduced
a similarly bland Chuck. "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" included Gordy
Howard the weatherman, whose job was to stroll in now and then for 30
seconds of chitchat. Knowing as we now do what Gordy's portrayer,
John Amos, was capable of later in "Roots" and even in "Good Times"
(which Amos made the best of), it is uncomfortable today to look back
at him grinning his way through Gordy's forced walk-ons.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily "token black" quickly became a buzzword concept and by the
1990s was a virtually obsolete term. The creators of "South Park"
even dropped in a black kid named "Token" with a "T" on his T-shirt,
with the implication that the very concept is now so outmoded that we
can laugh at it. No one could say that Avery Brooks' Hawk on
"Spenser: For Hire," black-identified and self-possessed, was a
token. Marsha Warfield's Roz Russell on "Night Court" was a similarly
memorable persona and wasn't even the only black character on the
show. Ever more often today, Hollywood is casting black actors with
no regard for their race in choice roles. Samuel L. Jackson's musical
instrument appraiser in "The Red Violin," or even Whitney Houston's
pairing with Kevin Costner in "The Bodyguard," would have been
unimaginable in 1968. The next Austin Powers girl is Destiny's
Child's Beyonce Knowles, and the next Bond girl is Halle Berry.</TE>
<TE>   And Berry brings us, of course, to this year's Oscars. That Berry
and Denzel Washington took the top prizes was not the only heartening
news. There have long been hints bandied about that the Oscar
selection committees are racist, and it would have been easy for the
voters to hand the top awards one year to two black actors for
bread-and-butter performances in so-so movies. But Berry's
performance in "Monster's Ball" was one of her best and easily equal
to her competitors', and Washington's work in "Training Day" turned a
workaday script into an electric, memorable film.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other developments these days that are making me
wonder whether it might still be too early to laugh at "South Park's"
Token. I just caught the stage musical "Urinetown" in New York, hands
down the freshest, cleverest, funniest musical to hit Broadway in 10
years. But it is marred by one of the most blatant bits of token
casting I have seen in about as long. In an otherwise all-white cast,
a black man is the only person on stage with no actual character to
play and barely a line. He just fills out the dance formations and
crowd scenes, obviously cast to duck the show being tarred as "all
white." I'm happy that the actor has work and exposure in such a
choice venue. But let's face that he is a singing, dancing Gordy the
weatherman.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the young creators of "Urinetown" felt that they were
doing the right thing. Affirmative-action policies began as a call to
seek out qualified blacks to allow them access to avenues closed to
them for centuries. But in the 1980s, too many distorted this into
insisting that sheer "head counts" were the central concern,
regardless of qualification. In this spirit, NAACP President Kweisi
Mfume has excoriated the major networks for not including enough
"black faces" in their seasonal lineups. But as the producers jump to
his tune, we find too often that Franklin is ba-aack.</TE>
<TE>   Take Wendell Pierce, for example, an accomplished stage actor who
drew rave reviews in the San Francisco production of Anton Chekhov's
"Uncle Vanya," which I saw. But two years ago he was cast as "the
best friend" in former "Wings" star Steven Weber's two-season sitcom
flop. His chemistry with the other actors was nil; he was clearly
cast simply to, as they used to say, "lend some color." I'm sure
Pierce would rather have had the work than not. But it was awkward
seeing this artist cavorting perfunctorily with white actors looking
like he had walked in from some other show--or worse, like a "Negro"
token circa 1968.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Regina King is stuck with a similar role in "Leap of
Faith." This decent "Sex and the City" knockoff depicts attractive
people in their 20s dishing and dating in New York City. King is cast
as one of three gal confidantes, but again the writers think that
King's pigment suffices as a character. Sure, now and then she gets a
mildly "don't mess with me" kind of line, to lend her a bit of
homegirl sass. But this alone does not make a personality. It's not
that the kinds of people in this show might not have a black friend
in 2002, nor is it that all blacks must be drawn as "street" to be
authentic. But when a major character has no distinguishable
personality, the script sags every time that character speaks. King
grew up before our eyes on the sitcom "227" and has excelled in
movies like "Poetic Justice," in which she was given a real role to
fill out. But here, not only is she wasted, a promising show is
weakened.</TE>
<TE>   Is this kind of casting really progress? I would rather see black
actors playing the live-action cartoon characters on the
featherweight black sitcoms on WB and UPN than watch them spinning
their wheels being set decorations on other shows. Mfume might be
satisfied with mere "black faces." But the last time I checked, what
we were after was treating black people as full human beings.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, those creating these shows might feel damned if
they do and damned if they don't, but it's actually very simple. When
casting black performers, producers should find it as unthinkable not
to give them characters to play as they would if the performer were
white. Skin color is not a personality trait. To cast black
performers without giving them any identifiable personality traits is
so dehumanizing that it would be closer to doing the right thing to
not cast them at all.</TE>

<HD>The Wealth Effect</HD>
<DH>California, increasingly a magnet for the prosperous, has
the clear economic edge. But will that translate into enduring
national political clout?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>Kevin Phillips' latest book is "Wealth and Democracy: A
Political History of the American Rich."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The new wealth map of the United States, powerfully
redrawn over the last two decades, shows California moving ahead,
Texas trying to pass the Golden State and New York losing its once
great lead. Doubly significant is that state and national politics
are beginning to pick up the tensions created by this wealth shift.</LD>
<LD>   Tremors are already evident in the 2002 elections. The Texas-run
Bush White House, out to neutralize California by getting a GOP
governor elected so that Democrats can't take the state for granted
in the 2004 presidential race, has wound up with a miscast Republican
nominee of a sort never expected. He's Bill Simon Jr., an
archconservative financier with Texas connections and ties to both
Enron wheeling and dealing and the religious right. That's double
trouble, because Texas and California, which three decades ago shared
a Sun Belt conservative trend, are now emerging at polar ends of a
new cultural economics.</LD>
<LD>   California has the early 21st century edge in wealth. Despite the
Nasdaq nosedive and high-tech trauma, the 2001 ranking of the 400
richest Americans had California in the top spot with 92, New York
next with 49 and Texas third with 36. First-quarter venture-capital
data also showed California remaining well ahead of the other two
states.</LD>
<TE>   Part of California's economic advantage is that the state is the
major U.S. Pacific Rim window on the emerging economic and
technological powerhouses of Asia. As for its cultural economics,
California's major fortunes are tied to the sort of wealth that
seemingly represents the future: computer networks, biotechnology,
nanometrics, electronic and video entertainment and other
intellectual property.</TE>
<TE>   This is where the new map gets interesting. The first stage of
California's modern economic rise came in the 1940s through the
1960s, when the Sun Belt phenomenon touched Florida, California and
Texas in substantially similar ways. All three major Sun Belt states
experienced huge growth and conservative political trends tied to the
economics of retirement, suburbia, agribusiness and aerospace.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, Texas briefly dominated the upper reaches of
the lists of the richest Americans because of the oil money of the
Hunt, Bass and Cullen families. But California has the most important
new mega-vehicle: high technology, which it rode into a new era,
passing New York in the wealth lists during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of population, the 21st century began with California
No.1, Texas No. 2 and New York No.3. More important, though,
California is the liberal U.S. capital of high technology and
entertainment, Texas the conservative capital of oil and energy, and
New York the liberal capital of U.S. finance and communications--and
their various rivalries mix politics and economics.</TE>
<TE>   New York, with its comparative population already slipping, is
dependent on finance and communications rooted in 20th century
prestige and technology. The giant media, symbolized by the great TV
networks and news weeklies anointed during the 1940s, 1950s and
1960s, are vulnerable to the new economic diversity. Finance has
become New York City's bread and butter. In 1998, H. Carl McCall, the
New York state comptroller, issued an analysis contending that 56% of
the city's total income growth since 1992 was provided by securities
firms. If the first decade of this century turns out to be one of
stagnant markets, disillusionment with finance and mild
re-regulation, the feeding trough profiled by McCall will dry up
considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Texas is the energy capital that would also like to be the
unofficial national political capital. Since 1980, each Republican
administration has had a Texan as either president or vice president.
Absent Watergate, President Richard M. Nixon was grooming former
Texas Gov. John Connally to succeed him, and the Texas reign,
consummated by Bush I and Bush II, would have started even earlier.
Texas is also the buckle on the GOP Bible Belt coalition, as well as
a major linchpin of the now increasingly Southern-centered U.S.
defense-industry and military-base axis.</TE>
<TE>   Like oil and water, Texas and California mix less and less well.
To an extent, the minority culture in one is the majority in the
other. The most Democratic part of affluent Texas is the academic,
governmental and high-tech district around Austin, while the most
Republican parts of California are focused on banking, agribusiness,
oil and the military. Some analysts have even seen a parallel in the
2000-2002 stock market, where the oil and high-tech sectors often
move contrarily.</TE>
<TE>   The political rivalry is also getting serious. When the new
Republican presidential cycle started in 1968, California was the GOP
pivot. Every Republican administration elected between 1968 and 1984
had a Californian as president. In 1988, the baton passed. California
is becoming the Republican Yesterday, the big state where Democratic
presidents now win almost without campaigning. Texas is the
Republican Today, the one big state where a GOP presidential victory
is virtually a given.</TE>
<TE>   Which is where the 2002 Republican
stratagem-turned-possible-disaster comes in. Elect a GOP governor of
California, Bush strategists hoped, and the Golden State would become
competitive enough that local Democrats would have to fight for their
2004 presidential nominee. California money could not go to help in
marginal states.</TE>
<TE>   However, instead of Richard Riordan, the moderate mayor of Los
Angeles and choice of the White House, GOP primary voters went for
Simon, a conservative with a resume heavy on Houston-style finance
and fundamentalism. Simon exudes the wrong images and issues--his
deal-maker's preoccupation with cutting the capital gains tax, his
anti-abortion stance better suited to Amarillo than Alhambra or
Anaheim, and even a tie to Enron, the malevolent Houston energy
peddler that electricity-sensitive Californians love to hate.</TE>
<TE>   As Enron's trading techniques and off-books partnership
arrangements come out in courts and other hearings, it's going to be
a problem. Not only did Simon, in 1995, reportedly arrange a big
Enron investment in Houston-based Hanover Compressor, a company he
founded, but the money came through Joint Energy Development
Investments (JEDI), one of the Enron partnerships at the center of
the federal investigation into Enron's collapse. (Last week, Simon
denied financial involvement with Enron and said he had not helped to
land the loan while serving as a Hanover board member.)</TE>
<TE>   Simon also reportedly worked with Enron and JEDI in landing
Hanover a role in a Venezuelan joint venture. Several years earlier,
an energy company run by George W. Bush partnered with Enron Oil and
Gas in a well outside Midland, Texas. This duality could give the
White House a new threat--a political Return of the JEDI?--in this
year's California gubernatorial combat.</TE>
<TE>   Not that California can sit back and count on 21st century trends
to consolidate its political and economic primacy and bolster its
wealth-holders. The rules are changing. Fifty or sixty years ago,
from Mare Island to San Diego, California was the principal
beneficiary of U.S. war mobilization. Now more of the military
infrastructure is in the South, and any major war triggered by the
Middle East conflict or a U.S. attack on Iraq could jeopardize more
Golden State international interests than it rewards.</TE>
<TE>   As for the political interests of high tech and entertainment,
intellectual property and its protection seem less of a focus in the
Bush administration than in Bill Clinton's. Another question mark for
California business has to do with technology transfer. The huge
numbers of East Asian and Indian engineers and executives in
California high-tech companies raise the prospect that, over the next
several decades, hundreds of thousands will take their skills and
investments back home and use them to grow what could, by 2030 or
2040, be an increasingly Asian-dominated global technology economy.
Kindred technology transfer--it can come quickly--helped shift the
global technological lead from Britain to Germany and the United
States between 1890 and 1914.</TE>
<TE>   Trade itself is a question mark. California's biggest exports are
technology and entertainment, but in the first nine months of 2001,
White House policy, under the lead of U.S. Trade Representative
Robert Zoellick, a former Enron consultant, increasingly emphasized
expanding the world trade agenda to include energy and water
services. Those ambitions were especially important to Enron and
Texas-based Halliburton, the company formerly run by Vice President
Dick Cheney. Technology isn't likely to be a White House priority
when its staff members come from the energy business.</TE>
<TE>   In California and elsewhere, there is little static about U.S.
wealth. But since the American Revolution, the use of politics and
government has been central to who gets what and how. Anyone thus
concerned with the names and sectors of the wealthiest Americans has
to keep almost as close an eye on the California-Texas-New York
political alignments as on the annual Top 400 lists.</TE>

<HD>No Longer Society's Victims</HD>
<DH>As one leader says, Latinos 'need not insist that we are so
powerless.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD>Gregory Rodriguez, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday, a three-member panel of federal judges will take up a
voting-rights case whose outcome could profoundly alter the way
Latinos view themselves and their place in California. The lawsuit
also raises questions about the future of a Latino civil rights
strategy at a time of growing Latino political power.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund is
challenging portions of a redistricting plan the Legislature approved
last year. Adopting a strategy used a generation ago for African
American voters in the segregated South, MALDEF contends that two
Southern California congressional districts--one in Los Angeles
County, the other in San Diego County--were drawn with the intention
of diluting Latino votes and ensuring the reelection of Anglo
incumbents.</LD>
<LD>   It's no secret that redistricting maps are incumbency-protection
plans. Nor is it hard to believe that the incumbents in the
challenged districts consciously moved Latino voters elsewhere. But
to win its case, MALDEF must prove that the redrawn districts deprive
Latinos of a fair opportunity to elect "representatives of their
choice." Put another way, the civil rights organization must show
that voters in the two districts would not--and could not--elect a
Latino candidate to office.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit's implicit view of Latino identity is as contentious
as its legal positions. MALDEF contends that whites, as a bloc, still
tend to vote against Latino candidates; the defendants say that
white, Asian and black voters all are more and more willing to cast
their ballots for Latino politicians. But whether decided in this
case or the next, it is becoming increasingly apparent that, while
cultural prejudice may persist, California's Latinos are fast
approaching the day when they will no longer be considered a helpless
minority in need of legal caretakers.</TE>
<TE>   While the MALDEF suit concerns only electoral behavior, the
question of Latino electability is a much broader one: Do Latinos now
enjoy unprecedented levels of social acceptance in California
society? Complicating matters is the fact that 23 of the state's 26
Latino legislators approved the redistricting plan and are, in a
sense, co-defendants in the suit. Furthermore, the more controversial
of the challenged districts belongs to Rep. Howard L. Berman, a
10-term liberal Democrat long considered by Latino advocacy groups as
a political friend. It is Berman's connection with the suit that has
ratcheted up both the stakes and rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   In a remarkable break with past rhetoric, several prominent
progressive Latino legislators and union officials have publicly
challenged the idea underpinning Latino civil rights strategy and
voting rights case law: that Latinos are necessarily best represented
by a Latino official. In part, politics--solidarity with a fellow
progressive--explains the change of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Both United Farm Workers' co-founder Dolores Huerta and L.A.
County Federation of Labor chief Miguel Contreras have vouched for
Berman's effectiveness as a Latino advocate. In an Op-Ed piece in The
Times last November, state Sens. Martha Escutia and Gloria Romero
dismissed the idea that Latino representatives had a "monopoly" on
advancing the "Latino agenda." They also disputed any need to create
more Latino-majority districts through civil rights litigation.
"Latinos need not limit themselves to only seeking office in 'safe'
Latino districts," they wrote. "We should not relegate ourselves to a
few court-imposed barrios."</TE>
<TE>   Even former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, who lost his
historic bid for mayor last year, has asserted that he does not
believe there is a bloc of voters within the contested Berman
district "who would systematically vote together to defeat a Latino
candidate." He, along with much of the Latino political
establishment, thinks the political playing field has been leveled.</TE>
<TE>   MALDEF's complaint does not dispute the fact that Latinos have
made remarkable political strides over the last decade. Still, the
lawsuit implicitly contends that California's racial climate has not
changed that much. When asked how a plan with strong Latino political
support could be discriminatory toward Latinos, MALDEF accuses Latino
officials of looking out for their own incumbency rather than for
Latino voters--an odd contortion, to say the least.</TE>
<TE>   So, who does represent the "Latino community" in California? In
defending the legislation that included the redistricting plan,
Democratic Assemblyman Gil Cedillo went beyond progressive politics
when he suggested that Latinos had reached a point at which they
shouldn't depend "on the courts or advocacy groups" to protect their
rights. "We, the voting representatives--the representatives of the
communities who sent us here--can speak directly for our communities
to safeguard their democratic rights," he said. More extraordinary,
however, is that Cedillo, who comes out of the Chicano civil rights
movement, has suggested that Latinos have entered an entirely new era
"in which we need not insist that we are so powerless" and have to
"take our grievances to other nonrepresentative institutions."</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies the rub. The growing number of high-level Latino
officials makes it more and more difficult to espouse the traditional
grievance-oriented civil rights line. Does that mean that no Latinos
suffer discrimination? Of course not. But it does imply that
discrimination at the hands of others is no longer the overriding
factor in determining Latino political or cultural identity.</TE>
<TE>   If they aren't defined by their minority status, who are Latinos?
In its suit, MALDEF must show that Latinos are a "politically
cohesive" group at odds with the larger, white minority. If it fails,
the moral may be that Latinos are a heterogeneous group dynamically
and increasingly integrating with society. Latino identity, at that
point, would be officially released from its civil rights box.</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, Latinos have already jumped out of that box. The
larger problem today is that outside interests--be they businesses or
political causes--daily strive to repackage Latinos to serve their
purposes. A decade ago, Latinos as a group expected society to
neglect them or, as in the case of Proposition 187, hate them. Today,
they are assiduously tracked, courted and engaged at every turn. In
the early 1970s, books on U.S. Latinos frequently included the word
"forgotten" in their titles. The operative word now would be
"overexposed."</TE>
<TE>   Latino identity, then, is constantly manipulated by broader
interests. Anthropologist Arlene Davila contends that it was
marketers and advertising agencies that defined Latino consumers as
brand-loyal, culturally static and permanently foreign. A pro-gun
columnist wrote that "Latinos are easy converts to guns," and the
National Rifle Assn. has translated its children's safety guides into
Spanish and rehatched its mascot Eddie Eagle as Eddie Aguila.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, defining what it means to be Latino in America has become
something of a political Rorschach test. The reason is that we still
insist on defining a minority in one-dimensional terms, as does the
MALDEF suit. Furthermore, boxed identities are easy to manipulate or
"own." Yet, as Latinos gradually become a larger, more integral part
of California, the idea that they form a single, cohesive "community"
will be less and less convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Once the training wheels are off, whether in the form of voting
rights lawsuits or preferential programs, we will be forced to
discover anew who Latinos are. But rather than a single, uniform
portrait, this time we should expect a kaleidoscopic, contradictory
series of images--all of which will be true.</TE>

<HD>Church Siege Narrowed a Religious Divide</HD>

<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The five-week standoff at the Church of the Nativity showed just how
complicated a political role religion plays in Bethlehem. The siege,
which ended Friday, worsened the religious fractures within the upper
echelons of the Holy Quarters. But on the streets of Bethlehem, some
interfaith bridges became stronger.</LD>
<LD>   It was not the first time that the Church of the Nativity received
a flood of unexpected guests. In June 1967, several hundred
Palestinians took refuge in the church after the Israeli military
entered the city. Most were Christian, none were armed and all
returned home within days. But when several hundred Palestinians,
Muslim and Christian, retreated to the church on April 2 in the face
of the Israeli army, some of them were armed, and a violent deadlock
ensued. Fighting broke out across the city.</LD>
<TE>   The clash heightened strains in what was once a functional but
tenuous equilibrium among the resident clergy. Only after several
centuries of disputes within Christendom did a 19th-century treaty
divide authority over the site among the Armenian, Roman Catholic and
Greek Orthodox clerics who share jurisdiction today. At the start of
the standoff, it was not the Palestinian gunmen but religious
territoriality that held many of the clergymen hostage. Clerics did
not want to leave the church for fear that they might compromise
control over their portion of the shrine.</TE>
<TE>   The latent political differences inside the church surfaced almost
immediately, particularly between Armenian and Franciscan monks,
after the Palestinian gunmen arrived. As food became scarce, the
Franciscans disobeyed Israeli instructions not to share their rations
with the Palestinians. A statement issued by a representative of the
Franciscan order said that its clergymen would stay in the church to
protect its sanctity and accused the Israelis of labeling the clerics
"hostages" to build a case for storming the structure. The Armenians,
on the other hand, barricaded themselves in their quarters and opted
not to share their rations. When they abandoned the site, the
Armenian monks said they had been held against their will, a claim
undercut by the fact that the remaining Franciscan monks could go to
and from the church without interference.</TE>
<TE>   Christian churches have always served as places of refuge. In the
Middle Ages, not even the king could remove criminals who took
sanctuary in a church. Nonetheless, negotiators at the Church of the
Nativity feared that the Israelis might either storm the site or
irreparably damage it with sniper and tank fire. Gun battles and
attempts by Israeli commandos to enter the church had already sparked
two fires in the church's Greek Orthodox section.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiators were also concerned about how the bodies of slain
Muslims in the church would be treated. One of the Muslim
Palestinians taking refuge was Khaled Syam, a 23-year-old policeman
who was shot by a sniper while attempting to put out a fire near the
church. Khaled's body was immediately taken to a grotto not far from
the supposed site of the manger. Under Islamic custom, the body
should have been interred by sundown, but Canon Andrew White, envoy
for the archbishop of Canterbury, successfully pleaded against the
burial, fearful that it would have allowed Islamists to declare the
site a mosque once it housed the body of a martyr.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Holy Quarters, the siege in Bethlehem had a different
effect on Muslim-Christian relations. Muslim and Christian
Palestinians have always shared the goal of statehood, but their
relationship has sometimes been strained. Two months ago, Christian
Palestinians in the West Bank city of Beit Jala complained to
international human rights organizations that Muslim Palestinians
were deliberately using the rooftops of Christian homes from which to
fire on neighboring Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, tensions have run especially high in the
city of Nazareth, where an Islamist group wants to construct a mosque
adjacent to the Basilica of the Annunciation. According to Christian
tradition, the basilica was where the angel Gabriel announced the
impending birth of Jesus to Mary. The location is widely regarded as
the third most important Christian site in the Holy Land. Despite
reassurances from Islamist leaders that the mosque would not be a
problem, the Vatican strongly objected to the construction plan,
claiming that it would impede pilgrims' access to the basilica. As
construction proceeded, Christian and Muslim Palestinians frequently
clashed. The project was eventually halted.</TE>
<TE>   Such religious infighting is certainly not unusual in the region.
But the siege of Bethlehem further demonstrates that religion is not
the only, or even the most important, divisive factor. As the
fighting that began 18 months ago at the Al-Aqsa Mosque moved into
the quarters of the Church of the Nativity, it became evident that
the core conflict was rooted far more in land and politics than in
religion. When tanks rolled into the West Bank, they did not
discriminate between Muslims and Christians, nor did the Palestinians
divide themselves along religious lines in resisting them. The
Israeli aggression in the West Bank ended the altercations at the
construction site of the Nazareth mosque. It also silenced the
complaints of Christian residents in Beit Jala. The decision by the
spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, to join a
Christian-organized protest against the Bethlehem siege was symbolic
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Interfaith efforts in the United States in reaction to the
Bethlehem standoff showed there is no stark Muslim-Christian divide
in this country. Some right-wing evangelical Christians backed
Israeli actions. But many Methodist, Presbyterian and Lutheran
churches played a pivotal role in grass-roots fund-raising for
Palestinian relief efforts. Arab Christians in the U.S. mobilized
major rallies, including one a month ago in San Francisco that drew
more than 1,000 demonstrators. At the start of the Bethlehem
conflict, there also was a sharp increase in the number of
applications to join the Mennonite, Quaker and Catholic activists who
make up the Christian Peacemaker Teams, self-described "aggressive
pacifists" who stay in Palestinian homes in the hope of deterring
Israeli demolition teams.</TE>
<TE>   The siege at the Church of the Nativity has left scars on the
city's 10-century-old facades. Tourists, who are the lifeblood of the
municipal economy, will probably stay away for a while. Clerics will
have to put aside their religious and political differences to repair
the damage done to the Holy Quarters. For the rest of Bethlehem's
residents, facing a damaged infrastructure and minimal food supplies,
survival will continue to be the primary and shared concern.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: At 80, I am the oldest member on the board of our Palm
Springs-area complex.</LD>
<LD>   During the last few years a younger generation has moved into this
complex. I believe because of my age I am discounted by the other,
much younger board members. The younger owners have a very different
attitude toward money and the way things should be done.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that these board members are excluding me from the
"real" meetings. Every time they call a meeting they go straight to a
motion and a vote, and my presence and input are meaningless.</LD>
<TE>   When I was elected, I promised the homeowners that I would
represent their interests, but that is not happening. I believe the
reason I am allowed on the board is because the other members thought
I would go along with their "business as usual" tactics. This board
doesn't want homeowners to attend meetings, so they let the
homeowners come in, mill around for a while and, after they leave,
call the meeting to order.</TE>
<TE>   I do not like or agree with what the other board members are doing
and have tried to voice my concerns, but I am ignored. I must admit I
am a bit afraid to speak up because of my age. I brought this to the
attention of some other homeowners, who told me if I didn't like it
to get off the board or move out.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure what is happening, but it doesn't feel right. I feel
like I am living in a surreal situation. Is there anything I can do
about this?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It doesn't feel right because it's not right. The
Davis-Stirling Act requires that meetings "of the membership of the
association shall be conducted in accordance with a recognized system
of parliamentary procedure or any parliamentary procedures the
association may adopt."</TE>
<TE>   One such system, Robert's Rules of Order, is one of the oldest
guides on the subject and explains procedures for motions.</TE>
<TE>   First the motion is made; then it is seconded, followed by
discussion and voted on. Failure to follow procedure may not
invalidate the motion, but it means the board is breaking the law,
and it calls into question whether the board is legitimately
interested in its fiduciary duties to all the homeowner-members of
the homeowner association or the board members merely in serving
their own interests.</TE>
<TE>   The Open Meetings provision of the Davis-Stirling Act gives all
homeowners the right to attend board meetings. If the board waits
until the homeowners leave before calling the meeting to order, they
are breaking that provision of the law as well.</TE>
<TE>   Having been elected by the membership, the board is charged with
managing the association.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how unfair it may seem, ignoring or outvoting you is
of no consequence to the conduct of meetings. Your age should play no
part in the decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction from other homeowners, telling you to get off the
board or move out, is cause for concern. This response indicates the
growing difficulties of dealing with a board whose intention is to
rule rather than govern.</TE>
<TE>   Do not be discouraged. Continue voicing your opinions to the board
and make certain your comments and votes are recorded in the minutes.
Often, individual legal liability can be avoided if you show your
"due diligence" by lodging an objection or discussion on the record
and voting against a project when all others are in favor, or vice
versa.</TE>
<TE>   Should those who elected you find that this board does not respect
their wishes, they may finally elect others to the board who will.</TE>

<HD>Newly Built, but Not Worry-Free</HD>
<DH>As home buyers and builders square off in court over
alleged construction defects, one thing is certain: The trend has

<LD>Shelly and Jeff Comings could have handled ants, even spiders in
their brand-new Riverside home. But when winged beetles drilled
through the walls of the four-bedroom house about a month after they
moved in, the couple thought they'd better investigate how much
damage the insects could cause.</LD>
<LD>   After learning that the beetles' offspring can bore through wood
and metal years after eggs are laid and that extermination cannot be
guaranteed, the couple asked the builders of the 120-home development
to buy back the house. The developers, according to the Comingses,
offered instead to fill in the wall holes created by the beetles and
extend the home's warranty.</LD>
<LD>   The Comingses and several neighbors whose homes also were built
with infested wood sued the builder, who declined to comment about
the lawsuit. That was two years ago; the case is still pending.</LD>
<TE>   Each year, builders and homeowners--and a legion of
attorneys--square off over construction defects, from leaky roofs to
collapsing decks.</TE>
<TE>   Builders claim that many cases, especially those involving
condominium developments, are frivolous. They assert that typically,
a few units in a complex have roof leaks or squeaky stairs, but once
lawyers become involved, the liability claims include everything but
the kitchen sink.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of such lawsuits, builders say, has forced much
of the insurance industry to stop covering attached-housing
construction, resulting in a huge decline in affordable housing in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner advocates counter that if builders had taken more time,
care and money in producing their product during the construction
boom of the late 1980s, costly lawsuits wouldn't be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, if builders responded promptly to requests for
repairs, the defects wouldn't mushroom into the larger problems that
force frustrated homeowners into lawsuits, said Kelly Hayes-Raitt,
director for HomeSafe Campaign, a consumer-advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   As the defects multiply and lawsuits are filed, builders sue their
subcontractors, leading to layers of liability issues that take years
to sort out.</TE>
<TE>   "The blame game is present on all sides," said Keith Bremmer, a
Newport Beach attorney who specializes in construction-defect
litigation. "We thought these cases would go away ... but there is
still a steady stream of them."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, for example, residents of the Glen at Hillsborough in La
Mirada were awarded $5 million to fix decks, reset stairs and repair
roof leaks at the condominium complex. The lawsuit took 21/2 years to
settle; repair work on the development only recently began.</TE>
<TE>   "It took years to get the attorney, file the lawsuit, go through
mediation ... then interview the architects, contractors and
construction workers," said Kimberly Truitt, one of the plaintiffs in
the suit. "But it was worth it; we couldn't have been able to address
the magnitude of the problems on our own."</TE>
<TE>   Defects generally fall into two categories: faulty design,
workmanship and materials, such as water seepage, damaged or infested
lumber and defective plumbing; and landslide and earth-settlement
problems, such as expansive soils, underground streams, horizontal
movement, and inadequate grading, according to attorney Thomas E.
Miller, a Newport Beach construction-defect expert.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics are not kept on the number of lawsuits filed, but most
experts agree that they increased dramatically following the '80s
condo boom. Homeowners were helped by the implementation of "strict
liability" laws, which say that homes are defective if the builders
fail to construct them as well as they should be built, and by the
statute of limitations that lasts 10 years after the building is
completed. The vast majority of cases are settled out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades ago, construction-defect lawsuits were nearly unheard
of, as homeowners operated under the legal principle of caveat
emptor, or buyer beware, according to lawyers. But the condominium
boom of the mid-80s ushered in an era of lawsuits, as homeowners
challenged builders' warranties that virtually guaranteed defect-free
construction.</TE>
<TE>   According to builders and homeowners, most cases begin when
several condominium owners, for example, complain of water intrusion
or faulty plumbing, perhaps three or four years after the complex is
completed.</TE>
<TE>   The owners approach their association board, which may hire a
plumber or roofer to make repairs, if they're inexpensive, or go back
to the builder right away demanding fixes. What happens next,
however, is at the crux of the faulty-construction fray.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners complain that often the builders perform only
perfunctory repairs, and when the problems recur, refuse to address
them adequately. Builders say that they don't have an adequate chance
to address the problem before they're slapped with a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Thacker, 50, bought his Dana Point condo in August 1994.The
land surveyor noticed water coming through his windows not long after
buying the unit. After discovering other problems, his homeowners
association board authorized $30,000 to make temporary repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Thacker asked the board members, two of whom were
representatives of the builders, to rectify the construction defects,
but only minor repairs were made, he said.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, the builders' representatives were off the board, and
Thacker presented the new board with a 50-signature petition
requesting legal remedy for the defects, which by then had worsened.
The legal team conducted "destructive testing" on several units, a
process in which plaintiffs' experts open up several walls in a
complex, looking for defective construction or noncompliance of
codes. Among other defects, the testing revealed violations of the
electrical wiring in some units.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit representing 325 units was filed in September 1998, and
was settled three years later for $8.7 million. The plaintiffs'
lawyers received 30% of the settlement; the remainder of the money
went toward repaying out-of-pocket costs that accrued before and
during the lawsuit, and will go toward repairing the complex. A
confidentiality agreement prevents the homeowners from revealing the
name of the builder.</TE>
<TE>   "These lawsuits are worth it because homeowners are stuck with a
choice: either pay for the damages out of their pockets, or make the
builder responsible," said Rachel Miller, the homeowners' attorney.
"The average consumer doesn't have the expertise to investigate the
cause of defects or make proper repairs."</TE>
<TE>   The cost of lawsuits to builders has been significant, said Ray
Perl, a Building Industry Assn. spokesman. Condominium construction,
once a staple of the housing industry in California--comprising about
30% of all residential construction in the late '80s--has slowed
significantly, Perl said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, 18,691 condos were built, according to the building
association, while only 2,945 went up in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   First-time buyers, who for years counted on purchasing
less-expensive condominiums, have had to shift to costlier
single-family detached homes, the demand for which far outstrips the
supply.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance costs also have skyrocketed, especially for smaller
builders and subcontractors, said Pete Moraga, a spokesman for the
Insurance Information Network of California.</TE>
<TE>   For every dollar collected in premiums, insurance companies are
paying $4 to $4.50 in lawsuits, said Dan Dunmoyer, president of
Personal Insurance Federation, an insurance trade group.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to assess the risk involved in insuring a project
today, attorney Bremmer said, when, for example, a $2,000 plumbing
problem can end up costing $300,000 after workers have to break up
and then replace Italian marble to get to the broken pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "These lawsuits are full of inflated items to drive up the scope
of the repair," said builder Mick Pattinson, president of Barratt
American in Carlsbad. "I once had to pay $29,000 to tighten loose
shower heads. This guarantees that insurance companies get involved
and settle."</TE>
<TE>   The building industry, which until two years ago had few
legislative successes in limiting lawsuits, applauded a December 2000
California Supreme Court decision that prevents plaintiffs from
recovering damages for developers' negligence that have not yet
caused personal injury or property damage.</TE>
<TE>   However, a state Senate bill would nullify the ruling, known as
the Aas decision. Homeowners' groups are pushing hard to get the
legislation passed, saying homeowners should not have to wait until
hazards occur to recover damages to repair known building-code
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Other legislative efforts have had mixed results. The so-called
Calderon Process, enacted in 1996, is a pre-litigation procedure
requiring that homeowners' associations notify builders of a
potential lawsuit and try to work out settlements before filing
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   That process has been revamped under a 2001 law, which will go
into effect on July 1. The revised procedure includes the
participation of subcontractors, testing by the builder and
subcontractors and the exchange of insurance information, all during
the pre-litigation stage.</TE>
<TE>   While builders, homeowners and legislators continue to try to find
a middle ground for handling construction defects, homeowners such as
Julie and Dick Haynes feel they have no recourse but to sue.</TE>
<TE>   The Palos Verdes couple, who purchased their newly built
five-bedroom home in an existing neighborhood in 1998, encountered
backed-up showers and a flooding water heater their first night in
the house. The builder made some quick repairs, but they were
temporary, Dick Haynes said.</TE>
<TE>   Next came water pouring into windows and doors, warped floors, a
slumping fence and rotting patio posts. The couple has spent $20,000
so far on repairs on the million-dollar house, and has hired a
lawyer. The lawsuit, which involves multiple subcontractors, is
headed for trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wins in this situation," Julie Haynes said.</TE>
<TE>   Many developers now videotape and photograph the construction
process to ensure proper construction, and make sure their
supervisors are well-trained.</TE>
<TE>   "Builders are concerned with construction defects; they want to
still be around in 10 years," said John Burns, an Irvine consultant
to new-home builders. "They have a lot of processes in place now to
make sure the job is done right."</TE>

<TE>   How to Minimize the Pitfalls of Defects</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for some defects to crop up in a new home, but
builders and homeowners' groups say that cautious consumers can help
protect their investment by following these guidelines:</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure your builder is licensed. To check, call the
California Contractors State License Board at (800) 321-CSLB or visit
www.cslb.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   * Check out your builder's reputation. Ask neighbors if the
builder responds satisfactorily to complaints.</TE>
<TE>   * Verify with the state license board that your builder has a good
record. The board provides information about complaints and legal
actions.</TE>
<TE>   * Inquire about the training your builder's workers and
subcontractors have received.</TE>
<TE>   * Hire an independent licensed inspector. The cost is about $250.
Get referrals from agents or neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure you read and understand your written contract
thoroughly. Read warranties, as well as mediation and arbitration
clauses.</TE>

<LD>Question: Our home is 40 years old. In my bedroom bath we have a
four-way lamppost light fixture that holds four 60-watt bulbs.</LD>
<LD>   I was blow-drying my hair using a 1,500-watt dryer, and I heard a
pop. All electricity in the bath cut off, and now nothing comes on.
No other part of the house was affected. Can you tell me what
happened and what to do?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: If your hairdryer and the lamppost were plugged into the
same receptacle, chances are you blew a GFI circuit-breaker or a
fuse.</LD>
<TE>   If you have checked the fuse panel and found that all is OK, look
for the GFI breaker that controls the circuit for your bathroom. A
GFI receptacle contains its own breaker system (two plugs with two
buttons in the center). One button tests the circuit and the other
resets it.</TE>
<TE>   If you're unsure what a GFI breaker looks like, go to a hardware
store and ask to see one. Then finding it in your own home will be
easier.</TE>
<TE>   If possible, leave that light fixture off when you are drying your
hair. Better yet, get four compact fluorescents and reduce the 240
watts being used by your pole lamp to 54 watts. You'll have the same
amount of light as before, but you will be using 75% less energy.</TE>
<TE>   Several Coats of Stripper Needed to Remove Paint</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have stripped the paint from and sanded the woodwork in my
bathroom. But I am having a problem with a small amount of paint
bleeding through the stain. It was not visible before I applied the
stain, but appears as the stain dries. How can I solve this problem?</TE>
<TE>   A: It is difficult to completely remove all the paint from wood.
In fact, two to three coats of paint stripper must be applied and
brass-brushed away after you are certain that you've removed all the
paint.</TE>
<TE>   This is because narrow strips of paint always remain beneath the
surface and between the wood fibers.</TE>

<LD>John Bakewell Phillips, part owner of the Pittsburgh, Pa., newspaper
the Dispatch, commissioned brothers Charles and Henry Greene of
Pasadena to build this house in 1906.</LD>
<LD>   The Greenes, who had moved from Boston and opened a Pasadena
office in 1894, applied to this house what Charles Greene had learned
about the Arts and Crafts movement on a trip in 1901 to England.</LD>
<LD>   The result was the Craftsman style of architecture that brought
fame to the Greenes and lesser-known contractor Peter Hall.</LD>
<TE>   Hall met the Greenes the year this house was built. He went on to
become their most significant associate. Some of the best-known
Greene works such as Gamble House and Blacker House owe some of their
greatness to Hall.</TE>
<TE>   About the home: It's known as the Phillips House for the
newspaperman who came West in search of a better climate. For nearly
five years, it has been owned by Robert and Margaret Kincaid. He is a
businessman; she is a teacher. Over the years, the house has
undergone major restoration and upgrading in keeping with the Greene
&amp; Greene style.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $2.1 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: Five bedrooms and three full bathrooms in 4,791 square feet;
sewing/hobby room can be used as a sixth bedroom; the house is on
about half an acre and has three floors plus a basement; kitchen has
a breakfast area, and there is a library/family room.</TE>
<TE>   Features: Magnificent woods, typical of Greene &amp; Greene, are found
throughout the house, including Honduran mahogany, oak, maple,
redwood and cedar. The house has three dramatic, wood-burning
fireplaces, one with an antique, hammered copper hood, one with
handmade tiles and one with original blue bricks.</TE>
<TE>   The house also has an arroyo boulder chimney, copper plumbing and
marble baths and fixtures in the period style. A new roof and an
air-conditioning/heating system were installed in the '90s. Other
recent additions are outdoor lighting, an expansive brick patio, a
driveway and a carriage turnaround.</TE>

<LD>"Spider-Man" star Tobey Maguire has purchased a Hollywood Hills home
for $3.7 million. The actor, 26, is a first-time home buyer.</LD>
<LD>   The gated one-story contemporary has three bedrooms and 3.5
bathrooms in 5,000 square feet. Built in 1990, the property also has
a separate gym, two fireplaces, city views, an infinity pool and a
spa.</LD>
<LD>   Maguire, who stars in the movie as the Marvel comic book character
Peter Parker/Spider-Man, made $4 million for the first film and was
guaranteed a combined $23 million for two sequels, sources said.
"Spider-Man" was the first film to eclipse $100 million at the box
office during its first three days of opening last weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The actor previously appeared in the movie "Wonder Boys" (2000),
adapted from Michael Chabon's novel, and he starred as Homer Wells in
the 1999 film adaptation of John Irving's novel "The Cider House
Rules."</TE>
<TE>   He also co-starred in "Pleasantville" (1998) and played the son of
Kevin Kline and Joan Allen in "The Ice Storm" (1997).</TE>
<TE>   Brett Lawyer of Prudential-John Aaroe, Beverly Hills, represented
Maguire in his purchase, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Patti LaBelle has sold her West L.A. condo to Allan Davis,
who operates several L.A. nightclubs with his brother, Art. Among the
clubs are the Gate, the Lounge and A.D.</TE>
<TE>   The condo, which sold for about $1.2 million, is in a Wilshire
Corridor building with a pool, gym and a wine room with a 36-bottle
capacity locker for each unit.</TE>
<TE>   The soul diva's former unit has two bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms in
about 2,600 square feet. The master suite has a sitting area, steam
room and spa tub. The condo also has city and mountain views, a
fireplace and electronically controlled drapes.</TE>
<TE>   LaBelle, 57, owned the unit since February 1998. She spent months
remodeling it, then put it on the market when she found that she was
spending most of her time on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The two-time Grammy winner is known for her R&amp;B tunes, bluesy
ballads, spiritual songs and such pop hits as "Lady Marmalade."</TE>
<TE>   She also wrote a best-selling autobiography, a collection of
inspirational sayings and a cookbook. She's working on a new
cookbook, which will include recipes for diabetics and other people
with medical problems. LaBelle, a diabetic, is known for her work
with health advocacy groups.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Ann Simon and Heather Saginor at Coldwell Banker, Beverly
Hills North, had the listing; Nancy Sill of Prudential John Aaroe,
Beverly Hills, represented the buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Jenner, 1976 Olympic decathlon champion, and his wife, Kris,
have listed their home in the guard-gated community of Hidden Hills
at just under $3.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who have 10 children, have owned the home for six
years but are planning to move to a house on the golf course at Lake
Sherwood.</TE>
<TE>   The country English-style home that the Jenners are selling has
six bedrooms, 7.5 bathrooms, four fireplaces, a two-story great room,
a library, a formal dining room and a breakfast room in 9,000 square
feet.</TE>
<TE>   The house is on more than an acre of pastoral grounds with a
pool/spa, sports court and golf-practice facility with sand traps and
a putting green.</TE>
<TE>   The former Olympian, now in his early 50s, loves golfing when not
working. The motivational speaker, sports commentator, entrepreneur,
actor, producer and author is also vice chairman of the Longevity
Network, which markets health and nutritional products.</TE>
<TE>   His wife is a TV host and special correspondent for ABC. The
couple produce their own infomercials.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Chase, associate manager of Coldwell Banker Previews in
Studio City, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Kowalczyk, frontman of the rock band Live, has sold his
Hollywood Hills home to a record company executive for close to $2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Kowalczyk and his wife, Erin, moved to their new home on five
acres in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The home he sold has six bedrooms in 5,300 square feet. Designed
for viewing the moon, the stars and the city below, the house is
behind gates on a half-acre promontory with a pool, guest house and
outdoor cooking pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   The multilevel house was built in 1994 but looks more like it was
built in the '20s. Its construction was inspired by Madonna's former
home near the Hollywood sign.</TE>
<TE>   Kowalczyk's band, formed in the '80s when its members were
teenagers, released its fifth album last fall. Many radio and TV
stations adopted the song "Overcome," from that album, as an anthem
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Jory Burton of DBL Estates, Beverly Hills, had the listing, and
Mark Ettlinger of DBL, Sunset Strip, represented the buyers, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wally Kurth, who plays Ned Ashton on the daytime ABC-TV series
"General Hospital," has purchased a home in Manhattan Beach for more
than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1990, the Nantucket-style house has four bedrooms and 3.5
bathrooms in about 3,000 square feet. The home, which also has a
patio and a spa, is a short walk to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   When not working on "General Hospital," Kurth frequently plays in
Kurth &amp; Taylor, a band he fronts with Christian Taylor. Kurth
formerly appeared on "Days of Our Lives," where he played Justin
Kiriakis.</TE>
<TE>   The Parke Group--Patty and Reyn Parke and Steve Zukmann--of
Shorewood Realtors, Manhattan Beach, had the listing. Wendi Abrams of
the same office represented the buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese painter Ting Shao Kuang has put his Beverly Hills home on
the market at $18.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The artist decided to sell the 37,000-plus-square-foot house, on
2.25 acres, because he has not been using the property as much as he
thought he would when he bought it in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   A builder took six years to complete the 12-bedroom house in 1990.
The home was owned by a Russian banker and later a Rolls-Royce dealer
from Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Ting recently refurbished the mansion, designed to resemble a
French chateau. The 5,000-square-foot master suite has a fireplace in
the woman's bathroom; a Japanese soaking tub and steam room in the
man's bathroom; a library/office; and a barbershop/beauty salon.</TE>
<TE>   The home also has a billiard room, tennis court, ballroom/theater,
wine cellar and two regulation-size bowling lanes. The etched glass
floor in the dining room overlooks the indoor pool and spa.</TE>
<TE>   Ting, now in his early 60s, was too poor as a child to buy oil
paints, and so he mixed cooking oil with pigments to create portraits
of his neighbors. He moved to the United States in 1980 after
studying at the Central Academy of Arts and Design in Beijing and
became the leader of the Yunnan School of Art, which combines early
20th century European line art, watercolor and oil with motifs from
Balinese, Thai and Chinese folk and tribal themes.</TE>
<TE>   His works now sell for as much as $500,000 each, and he has
painted several theme series for U.N. postage stamps. He also painted
a mural for the Great Hall of the People in Beijing that is regarded
as one of the wonders of modern art.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Bekeris of John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates has the listing.</TE>

<HD>The Problem With Careful Planning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>First of three parts</SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernie Van De Yacht sounded a little alarmed as he emerged from his
dust-strewn kitchen. "A problem arose already," he said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first day of the first remodel of his first house, and
he had meticulously planned every phase.</LD>
<LD>   A chunk of ceiling had unexpectedly come loose. This was not part
of the plan, not part of the budget and not part of the tight
two-week time frame. But it was too late to turn back.</LD>
<TE>   In January, on Day 1 of what became a four-week, $15,700 kitchen
remodel, Bernie and his wife, Val--after three years of dreaming,
designing, plotting and preparing--anticipated the project would take
two weeks and cost $13,900 to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal: Gut the 1927 home's bland kitchen, with its tired
1960s and '70s look, and transform it into what Bernie called an
"American farmhouse '50s thing."</TE>
<TE>   But as the couple, both 38, were to discover during the next
month, remodeling a vintage home usually entails facing and fixing a
series of unforeseen problems.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how organized you are," Bernie said, "things will go
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   After discussing the damage with their carpenter-cabinetmaker,
Chris Trauger, the Van De Yachts learned they could either drywall
the ceiling or cover it with old-fashioned tongue-and-groove wood.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the setback, Bernie and Val were exhilarated that Day 1
had arrived at last. Outside their North Hollywood English Tudor
home, a carpenter's red work truck brimmed with the broken-down
cabinets and counters, which that morning had constituted the
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had been anticipating demolition day since 1999, when
they bought the 1,100-square-foot, three-bedroom, one-bathroom
cottage that satisfied their No. 1 requirement for a
house--character.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen's humdrum brown cabinets, linoleum floor and harvest
gold appliances, which looked like something from a '60s or '70s
remodel, were out of step with the home's charms--a steeply pitched
roof, open-beam ceilings, wood floors, French windows, brick
fireplace and arched front door. It's the kind of pristine, story
book-style house that causes passersby to stop and ask for a tour.</TE>
<TE>   In their first two years of homeownership, the couple took care of
what Bernie calls "the basics." They took out the ineffective wall
heater and put in central heat. "This house was so cold, I cried,"
Val said.</TE>
<TE>   They stripped the white paint off the beams, refinished the
floors, replaced a few windows and gave on Old World paint job to the
distinctive orange peel-textured plaster. For a personal touch, they
painted into a wall nook a gold star reminiscent of the gilding in
the church where they were married in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But after a year the Van De Yachts were sick of the dreary brown
kitchen. Aware that a kitchen remodel still was a way off, they
brightened the room with a coat of white paint and a refurbished
vintage stove.</TE>
<TE>   To organize their various home improvement plans and projects,
Bernie, who works as an actor, put together a thick notebook with
section dividers for each room. Each section contained before photos
of the room from various angles, plus clippings from magazines
showing details or overall themes representing the couple's ideal
plan for the room.</TE>
<TE>   The section devoted to the kitchen was dominated by a picture of
an old-fashioned room with a rough wood floor, white cabinets with
glass doors, a multi-paned window and a wide, farm-style sink with a
front apron. Details tacked on the same page show a cabinet door with
a stamped metal insert and a wall of distressed brick.</TE>
<TE>   Besides better aesthetics, Bernie and Val wanted a
better-functioning kitchen. While the space would remain small (10 by
10 feet), it could be used more wisely. The sink area was tight, with
the microwave occupying the counter to the left of the sink, and a
dish drainer taking over the counter to the right.</TE>
<TE>   The blender and toaster sat on the microwave, and all were plugged
into the only outlet on that side of the kitchen, awkwardly
positioned just below the sink.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awful," recalled Val, the cook of the household. A
stickler for cleanliness, she wanted to get a dishwasher and get rid
of the dish drainer. With careful planning, the microwave could be
relocated to a shelf in a cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   As the ideas and financing for the kitchen remodel came together
last year, Bernie and Val, who would act as their own general
contractor and hire out individual tasks, used the time-honored
method for finding remodeling professionals: They asked around.</TE>
<TE>   Their floor refinisher, Raymond Sjolseth, suggested Chris Trauger
of Champion Cabinets in Simi Valley. Sjolseth had not met Trauger but
had seen his high-quality work on other jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Trauger wasn't looking for more work at the time. A finish
carpenter for more than 20 years, he is typically scheduled months in
advance.</TE>
<TE>   The Van De Yachts' job was smaller than Trauger usually takes on,
he told them, but the job appealed to him, and he signed on.</TE>
<TE>   Trauger agreed to demolish and haul away most of the old cabinets,
leaving some bases in place to be fitted with new doors and drawers.
He would build new cabinets around the sink and around the
refrigerator on the opposite wall, install ridged bead board on the
ends, and build a knickknack shelf above the stove.</TE>
<TE>   Trauger gave Val and Bernie the names of the other subcontractors
they ultimately hired for the electrical, plumbing, counter-top and
masonry work.</TE>
<TE>   To keep track of the money, Val created a simple Excel
spreadsheet. Part owner of a women's gym, she has budgeting know-how
from her previous job in development at Disney.</TE>
<TE>   If the Van De Yachts had hired a general contractor to coordinate
and oversee the job, it would have cost 20% to 40% more. As neophyte
contractors, they had a lot of pertinent questions. In retrospect,
Val said she would have researched the remodeling process much more
thoroughly before the job started.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that was known on demolition day, and the couple were
filled with anticipation, along with some anxiety. How would the new
refrigerator (boxed up in the garage with the rest of the materials)
fit through the narrow doorway? Would the gray counter top go with
the rest of the kitchen? Would a '50s kitchen look out of place in a
'20s home?</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, optimism took over. Just hours after part of the
ceiling peeled away with the old cabinets during demolition, Val was
turning it into a positive.</TE>
<TE>   "I never liked that ceiling," she said.</TE>

<HD>Namath Has Learned How to Live With Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN WINE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CORAL GABLES, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Forget those notorious knees. Joe Namath wants to talk about his
thighs.</LD>
<LD>   He rises slowly from his chair and gestures toward the back of his
left leg.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a grapefruit!" he says.</LD>
<TE>   Or possibly a cantaloupe. Namath's hamstrings rolled up like
window shades when he snapped them 30 years ago, and the repairs left
a large knot in each leg.</TE>
<TE>   He also has new knees, bum thumbs, a bad back and a foot that
tingles at night. He has coped with arthritis since he was 23, and
three years ago a divorce that separated the NFL Hall of Famer from
his two daughters sent him into depression. There was more pain on
Sept. 11, when he happened to be in Manhattan, a few miles from the
World Trade Center as it collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   New York City proved resilient, just like Broadway Joe.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan on being around until I'm about 100," he says. "If that's
the case, I'm just in the early third quarter."</TE>
<TE>   The quarterback remembered for guaranteeing the New York Jets'
Super Bowl victory knows there is none. But he turns 59 on May 31 and
still embraces life with the charismatic zeal that has long made fans
cheer.</TE>
<TE>   His summer football camp will soon begin its 31st year, and he
works for ESPN, CBS SportsLine, an investment group and a drug
company. He speaks at arthritis seminars, recommending a good diet,
attitude and exercise regimen to reduce the pain he knows so well.</TE>
<TE>   He offers advice on other topics, too.</TE>
<TE>   "If any of you ladies are unhappy with the pantyhose you wear,
I'll let you know what kind I like," he tells an audience of several
hundred in Coral Gables.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly female crowd loves Namath and his big nose, stooped
shoulders and Pennsylvania brogue.</TE>
<TE>   He enters the banquet hall with the jaunty grace unique to
athletes, and when he flashes an infectious grin at the roomful of
arthritis sufferers, they react like a Shea Stadium crowd after one
of his touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Following a series of questions for other panelists about symptoms
and medication, a woman addresses Namath.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to tell you I think you're one of the greatest men
who ever lived," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you," he responds with a smile. "Is that a wedding band on
your hand?"</TE>
<TE>   Namath does not tell the audience that after 14 years of marriage,
he divorced in 1999, and that caused his greatest pain.</TE>
<TE>   He remained in Florida, where he has had a home since 1966, while
his ex-wife and their daughters--now 11 and 16--moved to California.
He misses the kids terribly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better today than it was a couple of years ago, but that was
the most devastating thing I had ever gone through," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point I had to take medication for depression. I started
hurting and felt awful and had these chest pains. Depression can make
your body do some strange things and feel some strange ways, man. You
get up in middle of the night and you can't breathe. You're
consumed."</TE>
<TE>   The situation improved when Namath, who lives north of Palm Beach,
bought a second home in Los Angeles. That allowed him to visit his
daughters more often.</TE>
<TE>   "Some pain never goes completely away, but you learn to deal with
it and make the best of it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time, maybe a year and a half ago, when I was with my
girls in California, and we were driving somewhere and they were
laughing and seemed so happy. And that's what's important--not
necessarily how I feel or what we've been through, but that they're
happy and healthy. It just dawned on me. So that was a help."</TE>
<TE>   As for the other aches, knee replacement surgery 10 years ago
allowed Namath to walk without hurting for the first time since 1965.
Throbbing thumbs give him the most trouble now, sometimes keeping him
awake at night, but he says they're better since he started taking
arthritis medication.</TE>
<TE>   He tries to follow his own advice by staying active. A golf buddy
says Namath swings as if he's standing in cement and still shoots in
the 70s.</TE>
<TE>   He learned long ago how to play hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Like Namath, former Jets teammate Jim Hudson underwent knee
replacement surgery and says every player on their team needed at
least one knee operation. Even so, Namath stood out. "He went through
more pain than anybody," Hudson says.</TE>
<TE>   Namath still holds most Jets passing records and still wears the
Super Bowl ring he earned for the 1969 upset victory he guaranteed.
He recounts his long list of injuries cheerfully, regarding them as
souvenirs of a well-spent youth.</TE>
<TE>   "Three torn ligaments in my right shoulder, one in my left, a
broken wrist, a broken cheekbone, a broken ankle, two severed
hamstring muscles. Do dislocated fingers count? I only had one of
those, actually."</TE>
<TE>   Concussions?</TE>
<TE>   "Back then we didn't know what a concussion was," he says. "We
knew what smelling salt was."</TE>
<TE>   The most painful injury was to a nerve in his left leg, requiring
his fifth knee operation.</TE>
<TE>   "My foot stayed numb for four years," he says. "At night at times,
it still gets hot and tingly."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years have transformed awful injuries into funny stories,
and now he's shaking again, this time with laughter.</TE>

<HD>Hunter Is His Own Man for Twins</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Minnesota's center fielder approaches Hall of
Famer Puckett's standards, but doesn't like the comparisons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Kirby Puckett set a Hall of Fame standard for playing center field in
Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   Torii Hunter just might be able to reach it, but he doesn't want
to hear any comparisons.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to be like Kirby," Hunter said. "I want to be my own
player."</LD>
<TE>   Though perhaps a bit premature, the parallels between the two are
unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter was the American League's Player of the Month in April,
breaking Puckett's team record for home runs in the season's first
month with nine.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a superstar waiting to happen," teammate Doug Mientkiewicz
said. "He's got that Puckett-like quality."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter turns 27 in July. Puckett was a far more accomplished
hitter at that age, when he led the Twins to their first World Series
title in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   But Hunter doesn't even have 1,500 at-bats in the majors, yet he
won his first Gold Glove last season and he is among the AL leaders
for nearly every offensive category this year. With an easygoing,
easy-to-like personality, he's fast becoming the team's most popular
player.</TE>
<TE>   Puckett's once-pristine public image has been tainted by
allegations from his ex-wife of infidelity and threatened violence,
so the Twins would prefer to keep his name away from Hunter's. But
they certainly don't mind marketing some of that same Puckett charm.</TE>
<TE>   "Torii's an approachable guy, and he enjoys interacting with
people," said Dave St. Peter, senior vice president for business
affairs. "That does more to align him with Kirby as a player than
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter would rather sidestep the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you believe that you're the man and all that, you'll get
slapped right in the face," he said. "I just want to keep my mind
focused on playing, go out there and have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the first-place Twins with an average that's hovered
around .350 all month, excellent power numbers and more spectacular
plays in the field, Hunter is having a blast. It's been just as fun
to manage him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's worked very hard at his game, and he's willing to do
anything to make himself better," Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Makes
it pretty easy for a manager to write his name down every day."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball wasn't always such a good time for Hunter. Batting below
.200 in May 2000, he was sent to the minors.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have confidence at all that I was going to be back
here," Hunter said. "I'm like, 'Man, they don't like me anymore.' I
thought I was going to get traded."</TE>
<TE>   Now?</TE>
<TE>   "Everything's changed," Hunter said. "I love it here."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are relieved they didn't get rid of him two years ago.
During his time in Triple-A, Hunter says he stopped trying to please
everyone. He returned to the majors in late July that season and
finished at .280. Last year, he set career highs with 27 homers and
92 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "I told myself, 'It's your career,'" Hunter said. "You try to play
for somebody else, then you wind up hurting yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I've been back, I just tried to simplify things. See
ball, hit ball."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents notice.</TE>
<TE>   "In years past, you could throw him away and get him to get
himself out," Detroit pitcher Steve Sparks said. "Now you have to
change where you're going, in and out, up and down, because he's so
locked in."</TE>
<TE>   And don't forget the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime a ball goes out to center," Sparks said, "we know it's
caught."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's first-round draft pick in 1993, Hunter has taken his
share of homers away from opposing batters. With Double-A New Britain
in 1997, he ran through an outfield wall to make a catch.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the wall come up, but I'm like, 'Forget about it, I'm
getting that ball,"' Hunter said. "There was this guy on the other
side with a beer in his hand. I'm like, 'How's it going?' And he
goes, 'Dude, where'd you come from?' I said, 'From in there.'"</TE>
<TE>   One of six children growing up in Pine Bluff, Ark., Hunter didn't
have much, so he insists on not taking his career for granted and
keeps the needs of his siblings, parents, wife and sons ahead of his
own success.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the one reason I got in this game," Hunter said. "To help
my family out."</TE>
<TE>   Twins General Manager Terry Ryan was unable to work out a
long-term contract with Hunter's agent this winter, so the two sides
settled on a one-year, $2.4 million deal just seconds before an
arbitration hearing was to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter can't become a free agent until 2005, but the season he's
having is driving up his price.</TE>
<TE>   "We both gave it a good run," Ryan said. "It's not too much unlike
some other players who are young, where you take a run at it and if
you can't get it one winter you try again the next winter. Sometimes
those things work out, sometimes they don't."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter hopes it does.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it here," he said. "So many nice people. That's all I've
ever known, Minnesota Twins baseball. The grass isn't always greener
on the other side. I'd probably rather stick with what I know."</TE>

<HD>Running to Get Their Fill at World Cup</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Many U.S. companies jump at the chance to become a
sponsor at prestigious international event, which doesn't affect
American sports fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY WILNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the world's most popular sports event, except to Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The World Cup doesn't capture the attention of a Super Bowl or an
Olympics. Never has--not even in 1994, when it was in the United
States--and probably never will.</LD>
<LD>   For some U.S. companies, however, the World Cup is a great buy,
carrying international prestige and a place among the heavy hitters
of sports sponsorship. An official FIFA sponsorship costs $40
million, excluding company expenses for personnel, advertising,
marketing and promotions.</LD>
<TE>   Gillette, synonymous with boxing and baseball for decades, has
been a partner with the World Cup since 1970. The tournament, which
will run in Japan and South Korea from May 31 to June 30, will be
Gillette's ninth World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one of the few sports that truly has global appeal," says
Michelle Szynal, director of communications/global business
management for The Gillette Company. "And we don't just sell products
in North America, but all over the world. It's a great fit."</TE>
<TE>   It fits because, visually, World Cup sponsors get a lot in return.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the Olympics, you get dasher boards, so you don't have to
spend anymore than that and still you get a pretty good media buy for
your $40 million," says sponsorship analyst Craig Tartasky, chairman
of International Sport Summit and president of Vertical Sports and
Entertainment. "There is a high, specific value to that, whereas an
Olympic sponsorship costs $60 million for the rights to the five
rings, but there is no sight value."</TE>
<TE>   Gillette's involvement has grown from stadium signs during the
1970 Cup in Mexico to elaborate promotions, including a "Million
Dollar Kick" this year.</TE>
<TE>   While selling the product is foremost, the World Cup is a
compelling draw for a sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to quantify it," Szynal says. "Of course, to drive
sales at the retail level ... but we also substantially increase our
prestige in the minds of men who watch sports."</TE>
<TE>   This is the first World Cup in Asia, but the time change hasn't
soured American companies. Although the return on any TV advertising
could be minimal with starting times ranging from around midnight to
4:30 a.m. PDT, few sponsors expressed concern.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because the target audience is not necessarily the folks
watching ESPN and ABC.</TE>
<TE>   For MasterCard, the host sites present an opportunity to reach new
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. market is a secondary consideration with this event,"
says Deborah Hughes, vice president, global sponsorships and event
marketing for MasterCard International. "The TV audience will be for
U.S. games, the semifinals and finals, and with the Hispanic market.
But the World Cup is probably the most cost-effective and powerful
marketing platform for our brand worldwide. Having it in Asia, it
would be beyond our reach if we'd try to get to these consumers on
our own."</TE>
<TE>   MasterCard had 250 member banks participate in the 1994 World Cup
and 356 in 71 countries take part in 1998. The company will probably
surpass the '98 number for this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "For MasterCard," Tartasky says, "it is probably the biggest
leverage deal they do, because they are heavily invested in soccer
worldwide. If you have the World Cup every four years, they do
something every year in Europe and every two years in other events to
get the message out."</TE>
<TE>   Helping FIFA get the message out about the World Cup is Yahoo!,
which is producing the tournament's official Web site
(FIFAworldcup.com). Yahoo!, in its first World Cup, has a deal
through the 2006 tournament in Germany to make information available
in six languages--English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, French and
German.</TE>
<TE>   Results, statistics, plays and highlights of all games will be
available on the site, which has drawn such sponsors as MasterCard,
Budweiser, Adidas and United Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply put, soccer is the No. 1 sport in the world and the World
Cup is the pre-eminent stage of the sport," says Tonya Antonucci,
general manager of production for Yahoo!'s FIFA World Cup
partnership. "Yahoo! being a global company, this is the best
possible exposure for our users."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those interested users--more than a billion hits to
FIFAworldcup.com are expected during the 64-game event--are not
Americans. But Antonucci warns against underestimating interest in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there are a lot of hard-core and displaced soccer fans
in the U.S.," she says. "Don't discount them as a potential market.</TE>
<TE>   "With the time zone difference, this really is an Internet World
Cup outside of Asia. We believe most of the football-frenetic people
will be in their offices during the workday when they want access to
games and information."</TE>
<TE>   But Tartasky believes another media outlet will benefit more than
Yahoo! from the timing of games.</TE>
<TE>   "I would expect ESPN and 'SportsCenter' to have a huge bump for
their morning show," Tartasky says.</TE>
<TE>   Still, of all the new partnerships for this World Cup, FIFA seems
particularly upbeat about the Yahoo! deal.</TE>
<TE>   "FIFA has moved decisively into the new communications era," says
Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA. "This is particularly significant
for fans in different time zones to Korea and Japan."</TE>
<TE>   FIFA has gone through difficult times since its marketing partner,
ISL, went bankrupt last May. Infighting over how much of ISL's debt
FIFA covered is at the root of the bitter election campaign involving
Blatter and African soccer federation chief Issa Hayatou.</TE>

<LD>More than 61 million people traveled through Los Angeles
International Airport last year, many of them spending the first part
of their trip searching for a parking place.</LD>
<LD>   Although LAX offers a host of ground transportation options, many
of its travelers arrive and depart in private vehicles, according to
airport statistics. They pay as much as $30 per day to park in nearby
airport lots.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the best way to the airport depends on your
priorities--cost, convenience or flexibility. Below are some
alternatives to parking at the airport.</LD>
<TE>   CITY BUSES TO LAX</TE>
<TE>   Going to LAX on a city bus can be convenient and direct if you
live near Metropolitan Transit Authority routes or can get a
connection or lift to one. Information is available on the Web site
www.mta.net or by calling (800) COMMUTE (266-6883).</TE>
<TE>   The bus is usually the cheapest way to go: $1.35 is the standard
fare (excluding transfers; seniors, children and others are lower),
and the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus charges 50 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Several bus routes stop at the LAX City Bus Center on 96th Street
east of Sepulveda Boulevard, by Parking Lot C. Walk 150 feet to the
Lot C shuttle bus pickup spot. The C shuttle is free and leaves every
few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   MTA offers frequent service to LAX on many routes, including
Redondo Beach and Union Station (lines 439 and 42), Long Beach (232),
Rancho Palos Verdes (225), West Hollywood (220), Downey (117) and
Sylmar (561).</TE>
<TE>   Three other city bus agencies run lines to the center by Lot C:
Santa Monica Big Blue Bus No. 3 (originates at UCLA), (310) 451-5444,
www.bigbluebus.com; Culver City Bus No. 6 (also originates at UCLA),
(310) 253-6500; and Torrance Transit Route No. 8, (310) 618-6266.</TE>
<TE>   SCHEDULED LAX BUS SERVICES</TE>
<TE>   Several airport bus lines serve specific areas of the Southland.
Among them:</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys FlyAway Bus: The bus offers 24-hour service from the Van
Nuys Airport Bus Terminal, 7610 Woodley Ave.; (818) 994-5554. Rates
are $3.50 one way for adults, $1.75 for children 2 to 12. Parking is
$4 per day with a 15-day limit.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Bus: This line serves Orange County, with buses departing
Anaheim and Buena Park hotels from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily; (800)
772-5299, www.airportbus.com. Rates are $16 one way for adults, $9
for children 3 to 11.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Bus of Bakersfield: Buses depart downtown Bakersfield from
3:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily; (800) 858-5000, www.coach usa.com. Rates
are $27 one way for adults, $13.50 for kids 6 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Airporter: Buses leave the Ventura Sheraton Hotel
eight times daily; (805) 650-6600, www.venturashuttle.com. Rates are
$26 (with reservations and advance payment) one way for adults, $10
for children under 12.</TE>
<TE>   SHUTTLES</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of van, car and limousine companies serve area airports,
and comparing prices is usually worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, only two shuttle companies--SuperShuttle and Prime
Time--are allowed to pick up "walk-up" passengers, although it is
possible to schedule a pickup by another carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttle fares usually are 30% to 70% cheaper than a taxi for
travelers who are alone, but couples or groups will find taxis
competitively priced and usually faster. Some shuttle companies offer
reduced fares for couples or groups.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Time Shuttle: (800) RED-VANS (733-8267) or (310) 342-7200,
www.primetimeshuttle.com.</TE>
<TE>   SuperShuttle: (310) 782-6600, (323) 775-6600, (213) 688-0444 or
(714) 517-6600, www.supershuttle.com.</TE>
<TE>   TAXIS</TE>
<TE>   Cabs may be more economical for people traveling shorter distances
or riding with others.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers should be aware of accidents and other safety problems
with "bandit" (unlicensed) taxis. Use only licensed cab companies,
which often offer flat rates to LAX. Avoid bandit taxis at LAX by
going to official taxi stands at each terminal, monitored and
controlled by airport employees. Cabs at those LAX stands must
display the official seal of the L.A. Department of Transportation
and can't refuse to take you only short distances.</TE>
<TE>   A $2.50 surcharge is added to all taxi fares leaving LAX. There is
a flat rate of $30 ($32.50 with surcharge) between LAX and downtown
L.A., and as many as eight passengers can share the cab or van for
that charge.</TE>
<TE>   DROP-OFF POLICIES</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, local airports established policies
about which kinds of vehicles--cars, taxis, shuttles and
limousines--were allowed to drop off or pick up passengers curbside
at terminals. Many of those new policies have ended, and airports
have reverted to their old rules.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport: Private cars are allowed to
drop off passengers curbside at the terminals. All taxis, shuttles
and limos can do the same. Private cars are allowed to pick up at the
curb as well. Information: (818) 840-8840, www.burbankairport.com.</TE>
<TE>   Ontario International Airport: Private cars are allowed to drop
off and pick up passengers at the curb. All taxis, shuttles and limos
can drop off curbside. Information: (909) 937-2700, www.lawa.org.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles International Airport: All vehicles are allowed to
drop off or pick up passengers on the arrival or departure levels.
Unattended vehicles will be cited and towed. Information: (310)
646-5252, www.lawa.org.</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne Airport: Private vehicles can drop off and pick up
people at the curb. Taxis, shuttles and limos can drop off curbside.
For the ride home, travelers should go to the Ground Transportation
Center, where taxis and shuttle services can pick up customers.
Information: (949) 252-5200, www.ocair.com.</TE>
<TE>   INFORMATION RESOURCES</TE>
<TE>   Information desks at all the airports have copies of mass transit
schedules, and they post them for passengers.</TE>
<TE>   MetroLink: For schedules and information, (800) 371-5465,
www.metrolinktrains.com.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak: (800) 872-7245, www.amtrakcalifornia.com.</TE>
<TE>   MTA and Metro Rail: For schedules, fares, etc. and other
information, (800) COMMUTE (266-6883), www.mta.net.</TE>
<TE>   TransStar: This trip planner, www.scag.ca.gov/transit, suggests
how to get from points A to B. It's sponsored by the Southern
California Assn. of Governments. The same service is offered by the
Ventura County Transportation Commission,

<LD>I've always thought that the best travel advice applies to every trip
you take. A recent column of several money-saving tips touched off a
flood of recommendations from readers. Here are some of them:</LD>
<LD>   * Be nice to the travel personnel you encounter. Compliments pay
off, a reader from upstate New York writes: "I have received free
drinks, free rides, airline coupons, room and seat upgrades, tour
extensions and other assorted gifts in response to my appreciative
remarks."</LD>
<LD>   * Many universities all over the world rent out their student
residence rooms during summer vacation periods, charging modest sums,
a couple from New Hampshire writes.</LD>
<TE>   * Some of the best lunch and dinner buys in America and the
cheapest gasoline prices are at casinos on Indian reservations,
writes a frequent traveler from Colorado. He has paid as little as
$4.95 for a lunch buffet and $9.95 for dinner, and as much as 20
cents less per gallon for gas.</TE>
<TE>   * Roasted chicken purchased at a supermarket or deli makes a
delicious and reasonable meal on the road when combined with a salad
and bread, writes a cost-conscious Californian.</TE>
<TE>   * Were you aware that hospital cafeterias, which are open to the
public, charge half the price of the average hotel restaurant? That
tip from a Nebraska reader.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid the transaction charges of ATMs on cruise ships by going
to the ship's casino and requesting that $50 or $100 in cash be
issued and charged to your cabin, advises a passenger from
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   * A Canadian traveler suggests using Internet auction sites, such
as eBay or Skyauction.com, for your travel needs. On eBay, she says,
one can sometimes obtain a luxurious timeshare that will cost less
than renting a hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't waste money buying street maps in a strange city, says a
thrifty tourist from Washington state. Simply use the street maps
that appear at the front of most Yellow Pages directories found in
your hotel room. (Either take notes on paper or copy the map.)</TE>
<TE>   * When checking into a motel room, writes the same individual, go
straight to the telephone book for the money-saving coupons that many
of them carry.</TE>
<TE>   * From a frequent visitor to resort hotels: If you love lazing on
a beach, go to a local Wal-Mart or surf shop and buy a reasonably
priced sand chair immediately on arrival at your beach resort.
Sometimes renting chairs can cost up to $100 for the week. Buying the
chairs has never cost her more than $25.</TE>
<TE>   * Single travelers should check out the Web site called O Solo Mio
(www.osolomio.com), writes a young woman from New Jersey. It clearly
states that it is not a dating service.</TE>
<TE>   * On a long-distance trip in Europe, writes a backpacker, consider
taking an overnight train on which you book, inexpensively, a
second-class "couchette" (padded sleeping ledge). You'll save the
cost of a hotel room for that night and enjoy a good night's sleep
too.</TE>
<TE>   * When purchasing locks for your luggage, says a Palm Springs
resident, shop in a hardware store rather than a travel store; you
will pay half the price and may get better quality.</TE>
<TE>   * From a reader in Massachusetts: When booking a hotel room in any
large U.S. city, always compare the rate with the prices at hotel
consolidator Quikbook.com. He has found Quikbook's rates cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   * On long road trips, says a reader from Ohio, one should take
insulated or Styrofoam cups, tea bags and coffee. When you fill the
gas tank, visit the station's store and, using your own cups, help
yourself to the hot water or ice from the beverage dispensers.</TE>
<TE>   * Travelers willing to have continental breakfast in their hotel
room, says a reader from Hong Kong, should remember that many hotels
provide complimentary tea- and coffee-making facilities. The night
before, look for a deli or bakery near the hotel and pick your
favorite rolls, bread or pastries to have with that free beverage.</TE>
<TE>   * "What were we thinking?" a couple from New Mexico used to wonder
after returning from a trip, suitcases stuffed with T-shirts and
other impulse purchases. "Now we save money (and feelings of guilt)
by not purchasing souvenirs," they say. "Instead we pick up business
cards, brochures and order forms for leisurely, thoughtful viewing
after our return. If we still want that redwood toilet seat a couple
of weeks after the trip is over, then we call to place the order."</TE>
<TE>   * Whether you are traveling in the U.S. or abroad, writes a couple
from California, the least expensive way to make long-distance phone
calls is by prepaid phone card. Frequently, cards can be obtained on
sale from Walgreen's, Rite Aid or a Sam's Club at low per-unit
charges.</TE>
<TE>   * The Web site of the Armed Forces Vacation Club (www.afvclub.com)
enables active or retired military personnel to rent unused timeshare
condos for $234 per week per unit, writes a retired major. These are
mainly available in off-season periods but in popular locations.</TE>

<HD>Keeping Kids Safe in the Air</HD>

<LD>Whether you are traveling with small children or sending a child
solo, the hassles associated with the new realities of flying can
turn even the most patient pint-size traveler into a young
Frankenstein. As the busy summer season gets underway, parents need
to find out the how the rules governing child travel have changed.</LD>
<LD>   Geane Dvorak knows well the travails of traveling with children.
Dvorak, 42, of Ventura, has flown extensively with her four kids,
ages 7 to 21. "Start them young," says Dvorak, who began taking her
kids with her when they were as young as 6 months. "And give them
something to keep them occupied."</LD>
<LD>   Her best tip: Set aside "travel toys" that come out only when you
are going on a trip.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration, which publishes tips for
traveling with children and "keeping the flight day sane" on its
Internet site (www.faa.gov/fsdo/mia/children.htm), takes Dvorak's
tips on travel toys a step further: It recommends holding back the
toys until you have boarded the plane.</TE>
<TE>   The rules for unaccompanied minors have changed and changed again
since Sept. 11, and they vary from airline to airline. Generally, a
child must be at least 5 years old to fly unaccompanied. Children
younger than 8 are usually restricted to nonstop flights. On some
airlines, unaccompanied-minor service is automatically provided only
for a child younger than 11. If your child is 12 or older, you must
request this service.</TE>
<TE>   You will sometimes pay a fee, which varies by airline, for
unaccompanied-minor service. United, for example, charges $60.
Southwest does not charge a fee, although minors may travel only on
flights that do not require a change of plane or flight number. To
know for sure, contact the airline.</TE>
<TE>   A child traveling with Mom and Dad doesn't necessarily mean the
end to worries. The lines at check-in and security are more crowded
than ever, so the FAA recommends that you dress your child in bright
colors so she or he is easy to spot. The FAA also suggests that you
give the child a card with contact information and other pertinent
data, such as your flight schedule and medical information, in case
you are separated.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling with babies and toddlers raises yet a different set of
problems--and controversies. Should babies be required to have their
own seat? Should they be in child restraint seats like those required
for car travel? Can they be carried safely on a parent's lap?</TE>
<TE>   About 4.6 million children younger than 2 fly every year,
according to the American Academy of Pediatricians, or AAP. Under
current FAA regulations, parents may carry a child younger than 2 on
their laps when flying in a commercial aircraft, and at no additional
cost. Children older than 2 must have their own seat.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent policy statement by the AAP calls for an end to lap
travel for children on airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents don't realize how dangerous it is to have a child on the
lap without a restraint," said Gail Dunham, president of the National
Air Disaster Alliance/Foundation, or NADA/F, a support and lobbying
group formed by survivors of air disasters and their families. "A
child can become a projectile."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey called for mandatory use of
child restraint seats on all commercial aircraft, echoing the 1996
recommendation of a presidential commission on air safety.</TE>
<TE>   Yet requiring child restraint seats could actually lead to an
increase in accidental infant injuries and deaths, according to a
1995 report to Congress commissioned by the FAA. That study argues
that requiring parents to buy a seat for an infant who might
otherwise have flown for free will deter parents from flying and will
encourage them to drive instead. Because statistics show that air
travel is safer than auto travel, the study concludes that more
infants will die in car accidents than will be saved by child
restraint seats on airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found serious safety flaws with some of the child
restraint seats used on airplanes. All eight forward-facing seats
tested allowed some head contact with the seat back in front of the
child, and six failed to meet minimum head protection standards. The
study noted that this was primarily a function of how child restraint
seats are strapped into the airplane seats, not a design flaw in the
restraint seats themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the FAA is pushing ahead with the presidential
commission's recommendation. "We have drafted a rule [for child
restraint seats], and it is now in the approval process," said FAA
spokeswoman Alison Duquette.</TE>
<TE>   So what should the parent of an infant do?</TE>
<TE>   Restraining a child by using a parent's seat belt or a seat belt
extender is not only dangerous but illegal. Booster seats like those
used in cars are also illegal on airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA and AAP make these recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Until they are at least 1 year old and weigh at least 20 pounds,
children should be placed in a rear-facing child safety seat that is
properly secured and installed.</TE>
<TE>   * A forward-facing car seat labeled for use on aircraft should be
used for children at least 1 year old and 20 to 40 pounds. (The AAP
is aware of the problems with forward-facing seats, but thinks these
seats afford more protection to children than seat belts alone, no
restraint or being held in a lap.) Child safety seats that fit an
aircraft seat and that can be satisfactorily restrained to it are
labeled as such. According to the FAA, child safety seats should not
exceed 16 inches in width for best fit in aircraft seats; this is
especially important in small commuter aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Children who weigh more than 40 pounds can be secured with the
standard aircraft seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   If you are buying your children their own seats on your flight,
airlines sometimes will offer discounts for the children's tickets,
but you must ask.</TE>
<TE>   A tip for parents who cannot afford the added expense of a
reserved seat: Airlines fill empty middle seats last. Book an aisle
and window seat, leaving a middle seat free in the hope you can
secure your child in that seat if it remains open. To increase your
chances of finding an empty seat, fly during off-peak hours and on
less crowded flights. You can ask the airline when you make your
reservation how crowded the flight is and whether there are other
times or routings that may be less full.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't purchase a seat and the flight fills up, you could
end up with the child on your lap for the flight. In this event, two
new products are meant to enhance safety.</TE>
<TE>   Baby B'Air is a lap infant restraint system approved by the FAA
for the actual flight parts of an airplane trip, although not for
takeoff and landing. The pediatricians' academy says the leading
cause of nonfatal injuries to passengers is in-flight turbulence, not
crashes. Baby B'Air addresses that concern. This quilted cotton vest
fits over a child's shoulders and is secured with nylon straps at the
chest and crotch. The parent's airplane seat belt is inserted through
another strap and buckled, securing the child on the parent's lap. It
comes in infant and toddler sizes and sells for about $30.</TE>
<TE>   The Tyke Tube is another safety product designed for lap-held
infants. It has passed testing in FAA-approved labs but is pending
final FAA approval for use on airplanes. The capsule-like tube, which
can hold newborns up to 20 pounds, is 24 inches long and 10 inches
wide. The baby lies flat, held in by a belt; there are openings at
the head and feet. The Tyke Tube also acts as a flotation device,
designed to keep the infant's head above water. Cost: about $150.</TE>

<LD>The dining scene aboard cruises has been changing in recent years,
driven partly by passengers who want to eat when they want rather
than follow the shipboard tradition of assigned seating, with diners
sitting at the same table with the same waiters and dinner companions
at the same time each night.</LD>
<LD>   Many cruisers prefer assigned seatings because they like dining
with the same people throughout a cruise and having waiters who know
their preferences after a meal or two. Also, assigned tables work
smoothly aboard large ships, which often have two seating times, one
around 6 or 6:30 p.m. and the other at 8:30 p.m. or so.</LD>
<LD>   But publicity about the dining options has confused many
passengers, and some don't realize that only two major cruise lines,
both American-based, have adopted a more open dining policy, and even
those lines still offer traditional assigned seatings.</LD>
<TE>   Norwegian Cruise Line calls its dining policy "Freestyle
Cruising," and Princess Cruises, "Personal Choice" seating. Carnival
Cruise Lines' "Total Choice Dining" has assigned seatings but offers
a wider range of dining times. Disney Cruise Lines has assigned times
but moves waiters and their passengers from one restaurant to another
each night.</TE>
<TE>   All of Norwegian's ships offer open seating for dinner, allowing
passengers to arrive when they wish during designated hours. If
passengers don't want to wait in line at a popular dining time, they
can make reservations as they would at a restaurant on land. (For
groups larger than four, it's always wise to make reservations.) Many
new larger ships have added small specialty restaurants as
alternatives to the main dining room, some of which attach surcharges
ranging from $5 to $25 person.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard Princess ships, passengers must choose open or assigned
seating when they book a cruise, but the line allows changes during
the cruise. With three large dining rooms and one or more alternative
restaurants on Princess ships, there are enough venues to have a
change of scene almost every night.</TE>
<TE>   As in shore-side restaurants, waiters are paid a base salary and
receive tips from the passengers they serve. The tips, usually
presented in cash on the last night of the cruise, average $5 or $6
per passenger per day for the two servers, with the waiter getting a
larger amount than the assistant waiter. Wine and cocktail servers
receive an additional 15% added automatically to the bill at the time
of service. On open seating with NCL and Princess, tips are
automatically charged to the cabin account unless other arrangements
are made.</TE>
<TE>   Small luxury ships, canal barges and expedition vessels usually
allow passengers to dine when, where and with whom they please,
either including the tips in the base fare up front or pooling tips
to divide among the service staff at the end of the cruise.</TE>
<TE>   In the list on L8, cruise lines that offer open or
restaurant-style seating are designated by a single asterisk (*).
Lines or companies that offer traditional and open seating on the
same vessel (as Princess does) or whose vessels offer either one or
the other are designated by double asterisks (**). Lines that have no
asterisks in front of the name follow traditional assigned seating
policy.</TE>

<LD>Here is a listing of cruise lines and their vessels. One caveat: Many
cruise companies prefer to sell through travel agents. It's best to
book through an agent who specializes in cruises.</LD>
<LD>   Listings marked with a single asterisk designate open or

open seating on the same vessel. Lines with no asterisks follow a

<LD>Avid museum-goers get a break with a new $55 pass called the "Best of
Balboa Park," covering admission to the San Diego Zoo and 13 other
attractions at Balboa Park, home to numerous museums, performing arts
centers and cultural groups. The pass is good for one day's admission
to the zoo and two days of museum-going (or three days, if you can
squeeze some in on the day you go to the zoo). It can save you money
if you visit the zoo and more than three or four museums in that
period. Zoo admission is normally $32 per adult, including bus tour
and aerial tramway ride. Museums range from $3 to $11.50 (including
an IMAX film at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center). There is no
comparable pass for children because entrance fees and policies vary,
a spokeswoman said. You can buy the pass at the Balboa Park Visitors
Center and the attractions, or in advance at (619) 239-0512,
www.balboapark.org.</LD>

<HD>Delta Joins Carriers That Are Charging for Paper Tickets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delta Air Lines this month became the fifth of the nine major U.S.
carriers to charge for paper tickets.</LD>
<LD>   Delta said it would charge $10 to issue paper tickets requested by
customers on itineraries that are eligible for e-tickets, now more
than 98% of its flights, said spokesman Anthony Black. Exceptions
include code-share flights and a handful of destinations, including
Paris and Cancun, Mexico, he said. The fee is waived for full-fare,
unrestricted tickets and for SkyMiles Medallion members. American,
America West and Continental also charge the $10 fee; Alaska Air
charges $20 per ticket order.</LD>
<LD>   Delta cited "increasing costs" for its move and also noted that
e-tickets let customers use self-serve kiosks and avoid theft or loss
of the ticket. But airline expert Terry Trippler noted a
disadvantage: If passengers need to rebook on another airline at the
airport, they may have to stand in line to get a paper ticket because
competing airlines may not acknowledge another carrier's e-ticket.</LD>
<TE>   But more airlines are accepting e-tickets from other carriers. As
of last week, American, Continental, Northwest and United had
so-called "interline agreements" with one another. Continental also
has an agreement with America West, and United with Air Canada.
Delta, US Airways and Southwest don't have such agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Although most airlines say they are trying to get more partners,
"it will be a long time before they have e-ticketing agreements with
everyone," Trippler says. His advice in the meantime: If you're a
business traveler who must get there on time, invest $10 in a paper
ticket.</TE>

Fry, CEO of San Jose-based Fry's Electronics. It will be open
weekends until June 15, then daily for the summer. Admission is
$29.95 adults, $19.95 children 3 to 12. (408) 840-7100,

<HD>All That Glitters Is Gold at South African Museum</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CAPE TOWN, South Africa--The goal of Cape Town's newest museum is not
to be a museum at all but an evolving "organic" complex, says
director Christopher Till. The Gold of Africa Museum, opened in
February by South Africa's gold-producing giant AngloGold Ltd., has
eye-popping displays of gold artifacts, an education center, a
sculpture garden, a goldsmith's workshop and a shop with designs from
local artists.</LD>
<LD>   The highlight is the Barbier-Mueller Collection, where more than
350 gold objects are displayed in showcases suspended above a river
of black sand. There are rings from the Akan tribe, some as heavy as
30 to 50 grams, and ornate pectoral plates inlaid with animal
designs. And lest you wonder about the future, the Gavin Rajah Haute
Couture Collection vamps what looks like a gold chain-mail bikini.</LD>
<LD>   The ascent to the exhibition begins with images of historic kings
in their gold regalia suspended ethereally about the stairwell. An
illuminated timeline of world history highlights historic trade
routes. Another area shows objects from ancient African gravesites.</LD>
<TE>   The museum, at 96 Strand St. in downtown Cape Town, is open Monday
through Saturday. Exhibit fees are about $2 adults, $1 children.

<LD>The Internet as a purchasing and planning tool continues to flex its
muscle among leisure travelers, according to a recent survey.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly a third of the 1,351 leisure travelers polled used the Web
to book a reservation, an increase from the 25% who did so the year
before, according to results from the Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown
survey taken early this year. They--and "they" are mostly Gen-Xers
and baby boomers--booked 2.1 trips online last year.</LD>
<LD>   "Once you've done it, some of the mystery has been removed," said
Con Hitchcock, chairman of the Consumer Advisory Board for Orbitz, a
co-sponsor of the YPB study. He thinks the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
played a role in the increased reliance on the Net because "it was
able to give a range of information that was specific to your flight,
your airline and your airport."</LD>
<TE>   The number of leisure travelers using travel agents, meanwhile,
declined from 29% to 27% among those who booked one or more trips,
the survey showed. But Peter C. Yesawich, president and CEO of the
survey company, said, "It is important to note that ... three out of
every 10 leisure travelers still use the services of a travel agent."</TE>

<HD>Lowestfare.com Stops Selling Air Fares</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Travel seller Lowestfare.com has stopped selling airline tickets on
its Internet site, www.lowestfare.com, and has shut down its Jetset
Tours division, an international airline consolidator that sold to
travel agents. Company officials said tickets sold before May 2 would
be honored and that www.lowestfare.com would continue to sell cruises
and vacation packages.</LD>
<LD>   Gail Golden, vice chairman and CEO of Lowestfare.com, said the
company lost its contract to sell TWA tickets at a discount when
American Airlines acquired TWA last year, prompting it to end its
sales of air fares. Lowestfare.com, controlled by financier Carl
Icahn, also owns luxury tour operator Maupintour Inc. and Gutsy Women
Travel.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So you don't want to spend the big bucks on that air ticket from L.A.
to Honolulu or London? The ways you can save on scheduled air fares
are legion.</LD>
<LD>   But it takes time to ferret out deals, and your savings will vary
from a few bucks to a couple of hundred. Generally, the more
flexibility and time you have, the more money you save. Here are
selected strategies and sites that may help:</LD>
<LD>   THE INTERNET</LD>
<TE>   It has revolutionized the discount air fare scene by allowing
airlines to get rid of unsold seats at the last minute. You'll find
weekend and other specials, sometimes carrying deep discounts, posted
on airlines' Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Check sites such as best fares.com, www.smarterliving.com or
digitalcity.com/travel, which post specials and weekend fares for
many airlines and destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Hotwire, at www.hotwire.com, claims it can save you up to 40% on
flights, hotel rooms and rental cars. But you have to be willing to
tolerate an element of mystery, because the site will tell you the
fare but not flight times or the airline until you have purchased the
ticket. Tickets are nonrefundable, non-changeable and
nontransferable. If you run into a problem, you may not deal directly
with the airline.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hotwire, the Orbitz Web site works with major airlines to
sell unused seats. The savings the online Orbot gives you aren't as
substantial as on Hotwire, but you'll get basic information--airline,
price and flight schedules--before you buy. Expedia has a bidding
feature called Flight Price Matcher.</TE>
<TE>   At the auction site Priceline.com, you can bid on flights, hotels
and car rentals. Do your research before you submit a bid because
once an airline accepts it, you are locked into a nonrefundable,
non-changeable, nontransferable seat. And you won't get
frequent-flier miles or upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   CONSOLIDATORS</TE>
<TE>   Airlines also fill unused inventory by selling seats at discounts
to a wholesaler, which will pass some of its savings to consumers.
Discounts can vary by route, season and flight time, among other
factors. Generally you will save the most from consolidators if you
are looking for a seat at the last minute or in high season. That
discount comes at a price: Tickets often can't be returned, changed
or exchanged, and in some cases you won't get frequent-flier miles.
Often you can find consolidators' ads in newspaper travel sections.
Here are a few:</TE>
<TE>   Cheap Tickets: 801 Royal Parkway, Suite 200, Nashville, TN 37229;
(888) 922-8849, www.cheaptickets.com.</TE>
<TE>   Cheap Seats: 19351 Londelius St., Northridge, CA 91324; (800)
675-7482, cheapseatstravel.com.</TE>
<TE>   Air Brokers: International tickets only, excluding Mexico and
Canada; 150 Post St., Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94108; (800)
883-3273, www.airbrokers.com.</TE>
<TE>   Flight Centre: Various locations in the Los Angeles area; (877)
967-5347, www.flightcentre.com.</TE>
<TE>   COURIER FLIGHTS</TE>
<TE>   These are best for solo and flexible fliers. The number of
companies offering courier flights has dwindled, a result of the
Sept. 11 attacks and advances in technology and customs clearance.</TE>
<TE>   The system works like this: A cargo company buys a passenger seat
to send a shipment overseas as baggage because it can clear customs
faster. Then the company sells the seat--the discount depends on
routes, time of year and how quickly the cargo needs to arrive--to a
passenger willing to give up his or her baggage allotment and fly
only with carry-on luggage.</TE>
<TE>   One travel expert has said that courier travel is dead; certainly
the deals aren't as good as they once were, and in some cases
consolidators can meet or beat courier prices. Some organizations
with a line on available flights and other discount services for
dues-paying members:</TE>
<TE>   Air Courier Assn.: Offers several forms of discount air travel,
including courier, consolidator and space-available fares; 350
Indiana St., Suite 300, Golden, CO 80401; (800) 282-1202,
www.aircourier.org, www.cheaptrips.com. Membership $29 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Courier Travel: Offers courier, consolidator and space-available
flights; P.O. 3051, Nederland, CO 80466; (866) 470-3061, (303)
570-0282, fax (303) 582-3061, www.couriertravel.org. Membership $40
lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   International Assn. of Air Couriers: P.O. Box 980, Keystone
Heights, FL 32656; (352) 475-1584, fax (352) 475-5326,
www.courier.org. Membership $45 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Jupiter Air: Sells courier flights from Los Angeles to Bangkok and
San Francisco to Singapore and Manila. Call San Francisco for
information: (650) 635-1700, Ext. 216; fax (650) 635-7363,
www.jupiterair.com.</TE>
<TE>   SPACE-AVAILABLE FLIGHTS</TE>
<TE>   This is a bit like flying standby. Company A sells you a voucher
for a flight between two regions during a time period you specify. In
return for the steeply discounted price, you may not be able to
specify a departure airport or your arrival airport or flights, and
you may have to go the airport to wait for a seat to open up. But the
company will get you from Southern California to, say, Hawaii or from
the Northeastern U.S. to Europe. Under another category, called
"space available confirmed," you can reserve a seat from 24 to 48
hours before your departure. Among the companies offering
space-available flights:</TE>
<TE>   Air-Hitch: 481 8th Ave., Suite 1771, New York, NY 10001; (877)
AIR-HITCH (247-4482), fax (212) 736-2062, www.air-hitch.org.</TE>

<LD>Immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, airports made security
changes that placed strict limitations on ground transportation
companies. In some cases, limousine service was curtailed; in others,
shuttle locations were altered and bus schedules changed. Travelers
found it more difficult than ever to figure out how to get from the
airport to downtown.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the new rules have since been relaxed. But the situation
is evolving, so it's important to contact companies in advance to
confirm your ground transportation plans.</LD>
<LD>   Here is some basic information for a sampling of major airports,
adapted from Salk International's 2002 Airport Transit Guide,
www.airporttransitguide.com. The booklet, listing hundreds of
airports, is $9.95 and available from Magellan's travel catalog,
(800) 962-4943, www.magellans.com. Another useful resource is

<LD>By now the benefits of home exchanging are familiar to many: Two
parties--singles, couples or families--swap homes for an agreed-upon
period, gaining the comforts and economies of living at home while
staying in another town or on another continent. Intervac, based in
the Bay Area, founded the first home-exchange agency in 1952, and
dozens have sprung up since.</LD>
<LD>   Home exchanging is based on trust, but it isn't blind trust. If
you are concerned about having strangers in your home, remember that
you're staying in their home at the same time. Usually the exchanging
parties get to know each other by phone, mail or e-mail well before
the swap; some exchangers arrange to meet at the start of their
vacation, even if only for an hour at the airport. You may be further
reassured to have a friend or neighbor act as your "agent," stopping
by to greet the exchange partners once or twice during their stay.</LD>
<TE>   Home exchange agencies say theft is not a problem; if there is
friction, it's usually caused by a difference in housekeeping
standards. But accidental damage can happen, of course, which is why
it's wise for a family with young children not to exchange with a
childless antique collector. (On the other hand, when two families
with children of similar ages exchange homes, they are often
delighted to find new and different toys.) Homeowners' liability
insurance covers exchange partners as it would any other house
guests.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, exchange services published their listings in
printed directories, usually issued three times per year. Prospective
exchangers paid to have their homes listed; when they received the
directory, they perused the listings and contacted each other by mail
or telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Now the industry has largely shifted operations to the Internet.
Those interested in exchanging scan listings online, contact
prospects by e-mail and have an answer in a day or two without
incurring postage or phone expenses. Though most agencies will also
do business by mail or phone, the benefits of using the Web are
clear.</TE>
<TE>   The agency acts as a clearinghouse; your membership fee covers
your home's listing and gives you access to other members. (Many
agencies will let nonmembers browse their listings to see what they
offer, but in most cases, member contact information, such as an
e-mail address, is available only to other members.)</TE>
<TE>   Exchanges are arranged by the members themselves, not by the
agency. As a rule, no money changes hands between exchangers.</TE>
<TE>   The services below have listings for properties worldwide. Many
offer vacation rentals, free or paid hospitality exchanges ("You be
my guest, then I'll be yours"), youth hospitality exchanges and/or
house-sitting besides standard home swaps. Exchange properties vary
from houseboats and RVs to modest apartments to estates.</TE>
<TE>   This list is not exhaustive. Agencies that did not respond to
telephone or e-mail queries were removed, and with a few exceptions,
very small agencies, foreign-based agencies and niche services that
specialize in exchanges between, say, gay and lesbian, Christian,
academic, senior or disabled clients are not included here. Find
these by typing the appropriate phrase ("seniors home exchange") into
an Internet search engine.</TE>

<HD>Read Fine Print on Insurance Policies</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if the world of travel insurance weren't confusing enough already,
the events of Sept. 11 have made it more so. It's more important than
ever to read a policy's fine print.</LD>
<LD>   Some things have not changed, however. If you're in good health
and taking a modestly priced trip within the U.S., you probably don't
need travel insurance. Definitions of "moderately priced" will
differ, of course. To determine your comfort level, ask yourself how
much you can afford to lose without causing significant financial
pain and how much risk you're willing to take. Balance that against
the insurance premium, typically 4% to 8% of the trip cost, depending
on the type of coverage.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, if you're investing several thousand dollars in
a cruise or group tour that requires you to make substantial deposits
and imposes heavy penalties for late cancellations, insurance may be
a good idea.</LD>
<TE>   Among the types of travel insurance are trip
interruption/cancellation, medical (covering emergency transport or
medical care or both) and packages that combine both types, along
with provisions for lost baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Trip cancellation/interruption insurance is designed to cover
losses if certain types of emergencies force you to cancel a trip or
cut it short. Such emergencies may include a serious injury or
illness for you or your family, a natural disaster, being called for
jury duty, a labor strike or an array of other circumstances,
depending on the policy.</TE>
<TE>   If your employer changes your schedule and requires you to work
when you were expecting to vacation, however, you're generally out of
luck with such policies. Coverage also varies for terrorist
incidents; some policies cover them only abroad, some since Sept. 11,
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Many trip-cancellation policies used to pay if your tour operator
or cruise line went out of business, a so-called financial default
clause. But since Sept. 11 and the travel industry financial problems
that followed, some have eliminated such coverage or limited it to
certain companies.</TE>
<TE>   More cruise lines have begun selling "cancel for any reason"
waiver programs, some of which allow you to cancel as late as the day
of departure. Such programs typically do not pay if the cruise
company goes out of business or files for bankruptcy. But they can be
useful if you think your travel plans may be in flux.</TE>
<TE>   A useful Internet site for comparing some of the major insurance
plans is www.tripinsurance.net, operated by InsureMyTrip.com, which
sells insurance. But the only authoritative source is the insurer
itself--and that fine print in the policy.</TE>

<LD>The first column I look for in the Los Angeles Times every other week
is the Slater and Basch cruise reviews. They are well written and
informative. I also realize they are guests of the cruise lines.</LD>
<LD>   However, their review of the Star Princess was way off base
("Princess' Star Ship Enterprise Makes Massive Just Seem--Big," May
5). I also was on the March 16 sailing. I have taken 29 cruises, and
I can honestly say I never heard so many complaints from fellow
passengers. The Times has an obligation to have their reporters and
writers present a fair, unbiased picture. I hope this review was the
exception and not the norm.</LD>

<LD>I enjoyed Susan James' article ("Spring Fever in Tehachapi," April
28) about her weekend escape to Tehachapi. However, many other
wonderful places to visit in this great little town also deserve
mention. I recommend the Web site tehachapi.cc/museum to anyone
planning a visit to Tehachapi. The site, maintained by the fabulously
active Heritage League, includes information and links on local
history and nearby Tomo Kahni State Park. In addition, several fairs
and festivals are held each year in the valley. Call the Chamber of
Commerce, (661) 822-4180, for more information.</LD>

<LD>Thanks for the beautiful shot of the rice terraces in the village of
Batad in the Northern Luzon highlands, Philippines, taken by Mary
Lang (My Best Shot, April 28). To add to her comment, "The people had
no shoes, but they wore prescription glasses": Going barefoot is
perhaps the most practical way of slogging along a mucky, unpaved
road. If your eyesight is not good, you really need prescription
glasses to see where you're going, or you could fall off the dikes
bordering the terraced rice fields.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "Conquering the Grand Canyon," April 14: My first
experience with the Grand Canyon was as a teenager in 1957, when our
YMCA group decided to conquer the canyon during Easter vacation. In
those days there were no fancy backpacks to buy, so we made ours out
of canvas and aluminum.</LD>
<LD>   There was no such thing as lightweight freeze-dried food. We
carried water, canned fruit and raisins with our sleeping bags.</LD>
<LD>   The trip started down the steep Kaibab Trail--from top to bottom
we took 21/2 hours. We camped at Phantom Ranch under the glorious
night sky. The next day we hiked out on Bright Angel Trail. From
bottom to top, it took me 61/2 hours. I have taken many backpack
trips, through the Sierra and 10,000- to 12,000-foot passes, but the
Grand Canyon was by far the toughest of my life.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Canyon's beauty can be experienced without reservations
or guides. I started with my mom's input and walked into and out of
the canyon in one day, as she had with the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a late start time of 10 a.m. and hunger pangs toward the
end of the hike, I managed to walk the 16 miles in about eight hours.
It was a drawn-out and exhausting journey, and it's not for the faint
of heart. But it's not impossible by any means.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, my mom and her Sierra Club group completed the trek in
less than six hours.</TE>

<HD>Weigh the Options for a Fair Deal on Foreign Money</HD>
<DH>Whether exchanging dollars abroad or at home, let the buyer
be wary.</DH>

<AU>JAMES GILDEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just off the plane in a strange country, weary and bleary after a
long flight, you'll almost immediately encounter a money-changing
booth where signs list the buy and sell rates for dozens of
currencies. Your jet-lagged state could be bad for your budget:
Changing a few dollars for taxi or bus fare at one of these airport
booths could end up costing you as much as a 10% premium.</LD>
<LD>   In the high-tech 21st century, there are more ways than ever for
travelers to deal with money abroad. The best strategy, financial
experts say, is to use a credit card whenever possible and ATM cards
to get local cash.</LD>
<LD>   "We recommend customers use their [credit] cards for big items
because they've got protection," says Mike Sherman, spokesman for
Visa International. Credit cards can be canceled and, unlike cash,
can be replaced if lost or stolen. If you dispute a charge, you can
issue a stop payment until it's resolved.</LD>
<TE>   Most important, credit card exchange rates are often the most
favorable. But beware: It's only a good deal if you pay off your bill
each month. The interest on a balance, even for one billing cycle,
could cancel out any exchange rate savings.</TE>
<TE>   The convenience of automatic teller machines is tough to beat--you
can withdraw only the amount of local cash you're comfortable
carrying. You'll find ATMs everywhere in most developed nations, and
the variety of networks (STAR, Interlink, Plus and the like)
practically guarantees that if your card doesn't work at one machine,
it will work at another down the block.</TE>
<TE>   Many foreign ATMs only accept four-digit PIN numbers. If your PIN
is longer, check with your financial institution about changing it
before you leave the country. Sometimes it's as simple as going to
your own bank's ATM and changing it yourself.</TE>
<TE>   You also can purchase traveler's checks in the currency of your
destination country. American Express, Travelex (which acquired
Thomas Cook Global &amp; Financial Services last year) and Visa offer
checks in a variety of currencies, including the euro. Travelers to
the Continent may find this particularly convenient since the euro
became the official currency of most European Union countries last
winter. (Britain, Denmark and Sweden declined to adopt the euro;
Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and all of Eastern Europe are not EU
members and thus retain their national currencies. For more
information, or to familiarize yourself with the new euro
denominations, visit the European Central Bank's Web site at
www.euro.ecb.int.)</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 8 million Americans expected to visit euro-zone
nations this year, millions of dollars will be saved on currency
exchange when traveling between countries, according to Neil Martin,
spokesman for the European Travel Commission. "It's just one of the
reasons Americans [could save] money in Europe this year," he said,
also citing generally lower air fares, good tour prices and the
strong U.S. dollar.To compare money exchange services and rates,
during a trip to London in mid-April I conducted an experiment by
buying British pounds using credit cards, ATMs, currency exchange
booths and hotels. As a base rate, I used the interbank exchange rate
(used by financial institutions trading in millions of dollars) that
was quoted in the Los Angeles Times Business section the previous
day: 1.4385 dollars per pound.</TE>
<TE>   What I found supports the experts' advice. Credit card purchases
indeed produced the most favorable rates, followed by ATM withdrawals
and purchasing pounds in the U.S. before the trip. The worst rates
were in airports and currency exchange booths in London. Exchange
rates for traveler's checks in U.S. dollars were either equal to cash
equivalents or a little worse. Here is a ranking of the rates I got,
best to worst:</TE>
<TE>   * Arriving in London, I used my Visa card to charge 23 pounds for
a round-trip ticket on the Heathrow Express, the high-speed train
that takes passengers from the airport to Paddington Station. I was
billed $33.43, an exchange rate of 1.4535 dollars per pound. This
included the markup charged by the credit card company, about 1% over
the interbank rate. It's a kind of hidden fee, but still the best
deal I got. (Call your credit card companies before leaving home and
ask what each charges as a markup on foreign exchange purchases. Then
use the one with the lowest markup as your prime credit card.)</TE>
<TE>   * Next, I withdrew 100 pounds using an ATM at a Piccadilly branch
of HSBC Bank, a large British financial institution. For this, my
home bank charged me $145.01 plus a $1.50 fee for using an
"out-of-network" ATM. The total: $146.51, almost 2% over the
interbank rate.</TE>
<TE>   * On the same day I was spending money in London, one of the L.A.
Times' travel editors contacted International Currency Express in
Beverly Hills, (888) 278-6628, www.foreignmoney.com. The editor was
quoted a cost of $148.82 for 100 pounds. This was about 3.5% above
the interbank rate but did not include the cost of delivery (about
$10 in L.A.) or pickup (parking, gas, time).</TE>
<TE>   * Tourist centers in major European cities seem to have currency
exchange windows on every corner. Rates at the Currency Exchange on
London's Piccadilly seemed to be the best in the neighborhood. It
added a 1.75% commission on 100 pounds, bringing the total to
$151.61, about 5.5% above the interbank rate. Don't be afraid to shop
around: Another exchange company just a block away was the worst
value I found.</TE>
<TE>   (One caveat: When you're ready to go home and considering changing
your remaining foreign currency back to U.S. dollars, the exchange
rates get worse and the commission fees jump--to 9.5% at one money
exchange. So try not to exchange more money than you plan to spend,
save the extra currency for another trip to the same country, or use
the leftover cash to pay off all or part of your hotel bill, or for
tips or shopping.)</TE>
<TE>   * My hotel, the Park Lane Sheraton, offered me 100 pounds for $154
with no fees or commission, but still 7% over the interbank rate.</TE>
<TE>   * The Travelex currency exchange in Terminal 3 at London's
Heathrow Airport confirmed my suspicions that airports have the worst
rates. Travelex's rate was about the same as at my hotel, but it
charged a minimum 3-pound fee (about $4.50), putting the cost of 100
pounds at $158.25, or 10% above the interbank rate.</TE>
<TE>   LAX was even worse. At ICE Currency Exchange in Terminal 7,
changing 100 pounds would have cost me $160.65, including a $4
minimum fee, more than 11.5% above the bank rate.</TE>
<TE>   * The worst deal of my London experiment? The Change Group, one
block from the Piccadilly exchange window I used, had the highest
exchange rate (1.5875) in my experiment, plus a 2%
commission--bringing the total for 100 pounds to $161.93, or 12.5%
over the interbank rate. The agent there, apparently identifying me
as American, offered me a special "no-commission-on-U.S.-dollars"
deal. As I walked away, she also shouted out from behind the glass
that she was willing to negotiate further. The idea of haggling with
someone who spends her day in a booth juggling decimal points made me
feel as though I would simply be opening my wallet and asking her to
help herself.</TE>
<TE>   When I returned from London, I called American Express to find out
what kind of value I would get by purchasing its traveler's checks in
British pounds. The operator wasn't much help. First she said she
could get me an "exchange rate based on the Internet," which she
quoted as 1.5359. But when I pushed for an explanation of what part
of that was the markup above the bank rate, she said, "I cannot give
you the breakdown."</TE>
<TE>   Because currencies fluctuate daily, I used the same standard for
establishing a base rate as in the examples above, drawing from that
day's L.A. Times Business section. Depending on the type of American
Express card you have--green, gold or platinum--it was 5.5% to 6.5%
higher than the interbank rate. Delivery, which takes from seven to
10 business days, is free, though a fee is added for quicker
turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Another, more recent exchange option is a prepaid ATM card, a good
choice for those who want to keep a tight rein on their travel
budget. Visa offers one called Travel Money, available through
Travelex, (877) 394-2247, www.travelex.com. You preload it with a
minimum of $300, then use it just like an ATM card, withdrawing cash
in increments as needed. "It's an adjunct to or in lieu of traveler's
checks," says Sherman, the Visa International spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Two drawbacks: Unlike credit cards, Travel Money cards cannot be
replaced if lost or stolen, and they can be used only at ATMs, not at
retailers such as restaurants or souvenir shops. However, a PIN
number that can be customized is issued for protection.</TE>
<TE>   You can also change money on the Internet. Several of the largest
travel sites, including Travelex, allow you to purchase currency and
traveler's checks over the World Wide Web. And many travel sites also
have links to currency converters. Both Orbitz and Travelo- city
linked me to a Web page called My Travel Wallet (a service of
Travelex), which allows you to purchase currencies online.</TE>
<TE>   If you are traveling to regions where ATMs are rare, you will have
little choice but to revert to the usual suspects: exchanging cash or
traveler's checks at banks, airports or hotels. Make sure to research
what's available before you leave home.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is a currency black market in many countries,
especially for highly valued U.S. dollars. The street rates may be
temptingly low, but watch out: Selling dollars on the black market
could land you in a foreign jail.</TE>
<TE>   So be sensible and plan ahead and you may end up saving yourself
money and hassles. These days, you definitely need more of the first
and less of the latter.</TE>

<HD>How to Get a Passport</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHARINE HAMM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you have to eat two frogs, the old saying goes, eat the bigger one
first.</LD>
<LD>   For those planning a trip abroad, getting a passport or visa is
like that frog entree: It may be distasteful, but once it's done, you
can move on to more interesting trip-related tasks.</LD>
<LD>   The State Department is trying to help travelers get things done
more efficiently by providing forms and information on its Web site
and by aiming to deliver the final document within 25 business days.</LD>
<TE>   There's even help for those who have waited a little too long to
eat the frog.</TE>
<TE>   If you are an adult applying for a new passport, begin by finding
a "passport acceptance facility," such as a post office or a
courthouse, where you can obtain an application form. Or you can go
to www.state.gov, which has application forms that can be downloaded
and can tell you where your nearest application facility is. You will
need proof of U.S. citizenship, a certified copy of your birth
certificate from the county or state (not a hospital birth
certificate), or a consular report of birth abroad or certification
of birth, or a naturalization certificate or certificate of
citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   You will also need two recent, identical passport photos, 2 inches
square, color or black and white, shot against a white or off-white
background, and $60. New applicants must appear in person (and may
need an appointment, so call before you go), at which time they must
present proof of identity, such as a driver's license. The U.S.
passport is valid for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   An adult renewing a passport may do so by mail. Forms are
available on the federal Web site above and at approved facilities.</TE>
<TE>   An important change for parents is the new rule governing
passports for children. Both parents must sign the application for a
child younger than 14. "It's a congressional mandate to address the
problem of child abduction," said Tom D. Reid, regional director of
the Los Angeles Passport Agency. The child also may need to go with
the parents for the application; to be sure, check with the facility.
Minors' passports generally are good for five years and cost $40.</TE>
<TE>   Another change: Photographs on new passports are digitized onto
the page, making them more difficult to tamper with, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   If you are going abroad within two weeks and don't have a
passport, help is still at hand. The Los Angeles Passport Agency,
11000 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1000, in the federal building at
Interstate 405, can help you speed the process. The office serves as
many as 700 people a day, so you must have an appointment. Call (310)
575-5700 for information. You will receive your passport within about
two weeks and perhaps sooner in extreme cases.</TE>
<TE>   You can have someone else handle the details of the rush process
by turning to a private company that specializes in quick
turnarounds. "We basically take your ulcer," said Michael Callahan,
president of Passport Express Services Inc., (800) 362-8196,
www.passportexpress.com.</TE>
<TE>   Such companies have grown quickly in the last few years as
international air fares have declined and more people venture abroad.</TE>
<TE>   These companies work to get passports quickly--sometimes within 24
hours--but at a cost, sometimes as much as $150 (in addition to the
cost of the passport), depending on how fast you need the documents.
Make sure, though, that you're dealing with a reputable company by
checking with the Better Business Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   If you need a visa, you will need to apply to the embassy or
consulate of the country you will be visiting. To see which countries
require visas, go to www.travel.state.gov/foreignentryreqs.html. The
publication "Foreign Entry Requirements" may be ordered for $2.75
from Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA
15250-7954; (202) 512-1800.</TE>
<TE>   Some rush-order passport companies also can handle visa services.
Fees vary from $50 to $75 plus the cost of the visa.</TE>

<LD>More Americans will be vacationing in RVs this year than last year,
according to industry reports and surveys. Rentals of recreational
vehicles are more than a third higher than last year, say the two
largest RV rental agencies in the U.S., Cruise America and El Monte
RV.</LD>
<LD>   Campground reservations are running 12% to 15% higher than last
year, the National Assn. of RV Parks and Campgrounds reported
recently, and many of the reservations are being made by first-time
RVers. According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Assn., 75% of RV
owners polled recently plan to travel more this summer than last, and
the average trip is expected to be 3,751 miles, 800 miles more than
last year.</LD>
<LD>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and their effect on airline travel
have influenced many Americans' summer travel plans. Families who
already own RVs are drawn to the money-saving aspects and convenience
of vacations on wheels--despite increases in gasoline prices--and
travelers who have not tried RVing are attracted to the flexibility
and control it offers.</LD>
<TE>   Novice RVers should rent rather than buy an RV for their first
experience and allow at least a week to get used to it.</TE>
<TE>   RVs come in two basic types: towable ones, pulled by a car or
truck, and motorized units, which are self-contained and have an
engine. Most rentals today are mini-motor home or motor home units,
but trailers are sometimes available to drivers who supply their own
tow connections.</TE>
<TE>   The least expensive towable RVs to buy are folding camping
trailers (priced from $3,600), which can sleep four comfortably and,
in most cases, can be pulled behind the family car and unfolded at
the campsite. Some have toilet facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Truck campers, which slide onto the bed of a pickup, have living
and sleeping units that can accommodate up to six people; prices
start at about $4,500. These are popular with outdoorsmen and
sportsmen because they can leave the camper at the campground and set
out in the truck. Truck campers can also tow a second vehicle, such
as a boat, or motorcycles on a trailer.</TE>
<TE>   The mini-motor home can resemble a van, with convertible multiuse
furnishings--such as seats or dinettes that unfold into beds--or can
be truck style, with a bed installed over the cab and additional beds
that fold out from a sofa or dinette in the living area. A van
conversion may not have bath facilities, but a mini-motor home always
has a toilet, sink and shower.</TE>
<TE>   A full-size motor home usually has a queen-size bed, a full
bathroom and an additional sleeping area converted from a sofa or
dinette.</TE>
<TE>   Motor home prices begin at about $45,000; vans styled for living
and sleeping start at $35,000. Van conversions, custom interiors
created to order, usually begin at about $28,500.</TE>
<TE>   A motorized RV allows passengers to move between the driving area
and the living area without stepping outside. A towable requires
passengers to leave the vehicle to enter the trailer. A folding
camping trailer is not accessible on the road while it is folded for
towing.</TE>
<TE>   Self-contained RVs do not need external hookups every night; the
propane-fueled stove, refrigerator and heater operate wherever the
unit is parked.</TE>
<TE>   Holding tanks keep a supply of fresh water and can store the water
from the sinks and toilet for two or three days before it's necessary
to dump them. Commercial campgrounds usually offer a facility for
sewage dumping at most campsites; parks and forest campgrounds
usually provide one central site instead.</TE>
<TE>   Although no special license is required to operate an RV, some
drivers may wish to arrange additional instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Campground directories list commercial and public campgrounds in
national and state parks, as well as those provided by the U.S.
Forest Service and Corps of Engineers.</TE>
<TE>   When shopping for an RV, visit dealers in the area and attend
local RV shows advertised in newspapers and on TV.</TE>

<HD>The World of Travel Keeps On Changing</HD>
<DH>Ever-evolving regulations can leave airline passengers
waiting and wondering.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If your last summer vacation involved air travel, it was likely a
matter of stuffing as much as you could into your carry-on bags,
cutting your arrival at the airport as close as possible and trying
to cope with the annoying routine of it all.</LD>
<LD>   What a difference a year makes.</LD>
<LD>   For air travelers today, change is the only constant. Since the
events of Sept. 11, the rules governing air travel have changed,
significantly in some cases, and the resulting differences range from
the obvious--long lines at security--to the subtle--new cockpit
doors.</LD>
<TE>   What is clear in this era of heightened security is that a
once-casual approach to flying is gone, probably for good. In its
place are complexities and confusion that can snarl even the easiest
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hassles, most of us are willing to put up with a
little inconvenience in return for a greater sense of security,
according to a recent Travelocity survey. Of travelers who have flown
since Jan. 1, 87% said they were willing to deal with the
inconveniences in exchange for better airport security, although 79%
said they were still concerned about security.</TE>
<TE>   Since terrorists turned four commercial aircraft into weapons of
mass destruction, billions of dollars have been poured into airport
security. The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, was
created in November and will employ about 28,000 screening personnel,
thousands of air marshals and support staff. The Bush administration
has asked Congress for an additional $4.4 billion on top of the
current $1.6-billion budget to pay for more manpower as well as bomb
detection equipment. The Department of Transportation, which
administers the TSA, has proposed using some of those funds to buy
1,100 computer-aided tomography scanners (like a hospital CAT scan,
only for luggage) and deploying them to the nation's 429 airports.
These million-dollar machines would create three-dimensional images
of the contents of about 1 billion pieces of luggage per year that
would be scanned by TSA personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA is scheduled to deploy federal personnel, including
passenger screeners, law enforcement officers and others, to all
airports by Nov. 19. Late last month, Baltimore/Washington
International Airport became the first to have its screeners
federalized.</TE>
<TE>   The DOT also has proposed buying 4,700 trace detection systems,
which check for residue of materials used for building bombs, at a
cost of $45,000 each. Congress has mandated that all bags be screened
for explosives by Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers have already begun to pay for some of this: Lawmakers
last fall imposed an airline ticket fee of $2.50 per flight segment,
with a maximum of $10 per round trip. Passengers may also begin to
see changes in on-board security. Besides more secure cockpit doors,
which Congress mandated in November, Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.),
chairman of the House Transportation aviation subcommittee, early
this month introduced legislation to allow specially trained pilots
to carry guns. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and Homeland
Security Director Tom Ridge have said they oppose arming pilots.</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines, meanwhile, has purchased 1,300 Tasers, an
electric stun gun that disrupts control of the muscles, sending its
victims sprawling to the floor. They have not yet been approved for
use and won't be deployed unless the government OKs their use, United
officials said. An official ruling is not expected until later this
month, a TSA spokesperson said.</TE>
<TE>   Telltale Signs</TE>
<TE>   Behind-the-scenes debates will continue, but passengers will see
unmistakable evidence of the new world of air travel, notably the
lines at airport ticket counters and security checkpoints. It's
enough to make a seasoned traveler blanch.</TE>
<TE>   "Arrive early, be patient and don't get flustered," said Blaise
Simqu, an executive vice president with Sage Publications in Thousand
Oaks, who flies more than 100,000 miles a year domestically and
internationally. "If you get upset by every long line, you'll just
make yourself crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Signs of normalcy are returning. The National Guard, an ominous
presence at the nation's airports after Sept. 11, is stepping down
and being replaced by local law enforcement personnel. And the long
waits, if not completely gone, seem to be more manageable. The
Travelocity survey found that in March, 47% of travelers reported
spending 30 to 60 extra minutes at airports because of increased
security, an improvement from the 52% who reported the extended wait
in November.</TE>
<TE>   The changes for the better are noticeable at some airports. In
Denver, airport wait times decreased substantially, with just 24% of
travelers reporting waits of more than an hour compared with 53% in
November, according to the Travelocity survey. Chicago (O'Hare and
Midway), Baltimore/Washington International, Boston and Dallas/Fort
Worth also saw improvements. LAX, however, improved only slightly,
with wait times of more than an hour 27% of the time, not much better
than they were in November, according to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "The airports are starting to absorb the process," Simqu said. "It
is still difficult but not as chaotic."</TE>
<TE>   Arrive Ahead</TE>
<TE>   When security tightened, the Federal Aviation Administration
recommended arriving two hours ahead of departure for domestic
flights and three hours for international flights. But now some
airlines and airports are backing away from that recommendation. "Our
research has shown that an overwhelming majority of our customers
have relatively short waits at security checkpoints," said Pete
McDonald, United's senior vice president for airport operations, in
commenting on the new recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   LAX still recommends that travelers arrive two to three hours
ahead for the airport's three peak travel periods: 6 to 8:30 a.m., 11
a.m. to 2 p.m. and 7 to 11 p.m. For nonpeak periods, it recommends
11/2 hours for domestic and 2 1/2hours for international flights.</TE>
<TE>   You should check with your airline because it will have better
information about its operations. For example:</TE>
<TE>   * United recommends that domestic passengers who are not checking
bags arrive 60 minutes before departure; for those with baggage to
check, it's 90 minutes. For passengers on international flights,
United recommends two hours, the same as before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   * Northwest recommends passengers arrive 75 minutes before
departure on domestic flights, two hours for international. It also
requires all passengers to be checked in and at the departure gate at
least 15 minutes before departure, five minutes earlier than the old
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Many airlines' Web sites have suggested arrival times that take
specific airport issues into consideration. But remember that every
airline's situation is different; you cannot generalize about LAX
based on one airline's recommendation. For example:</TE>
<TE>   * Southwest suggests that LAX travelers arrive at its terminal
11/2 hours before departure Tuesdays through Thursdays and two hours
before departure Fridays through Sundays. At Burbank, it's one hour
ahead for any day of the week. Southwest posts the times it suggests
you arrive at all the airports it serves on its Web site, www.south
west.com. (Click on "Updated Travel Information.")</TE>
<TE>   * Delta, which recommends one hour for domestic and two hours for
international flights, has one of the most ambitious Web sites
dedicated to estimated wait times. Go to www.delta.com and click on
"Airport Wait Times." It provides estimated wait times by airport and
breaks them down by peak and off-peak times, curbside, ticket counter
and security check.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a general gauge at any given time," says Delta spokesman
Anthony Black, and does not reflect such events as a security breach.</TE>
<TE>   Technology's New Role</TE>
<TE>   Technology is also helping speed passengers through check-in.
Self-service kiosks are available at many airline ticket counters. If
you just need your boarding pass and perhaps to check a bag, this
might be a good option. Using your frequent-flier card or the credit
card used to purchase the ticket, you can get your boarding pass and,
if you are checking a bag, a baggage claim ticket. You attach the
baggage claim ticket to your bag and hand it to an attendant at the
counter, and you are on your way to the gate in "90 seconds," said
Delta spokesman Black.</TE>
<TE>   The process seems to be catching on. After a publicity push to
encourage their use at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, about 80,000
Delta passengers used kiosks in one recent week. Delta plans to
double the number of kiosks at LAX in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Some airlines now allow you to check in for your flight before
leaving home using the Internet, an advantage for passengers with no
bags or those planning on using curbside baggage check.</TE>
<TE>   If you are not checking any bags, you can still check in at the
gate. To get through security, you must have government-issued photo
identification, such as a driver's license or passport, and some
proof that you are on a flight, such as a ticket or a receipt or
airline-issued itinerary for an electronic ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Most airlines have now reinstated curbside check-in. Check with
your airline before departing for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Only passengers are allowed past security, though arrangements can
be made with the airlines if you are accompanying children or
travelers needing special assistance to the gate, according to the
TSA.</TE>
<TE>   Only two pieces of carry-on are allowed nowadays--a briefcase or
purse and a bag--and security personnel can be strict, so don't push
your luck. If in doubt, check it.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: It was Mother's Day of a different sort when Anne
Marie Novinger took this photo of orangutans on the Southeast Asian
island of Borneo. "This mother just walked up and sat down," Novinger
says. "I was so thrilled."  She and her husband, George, traveled
from their home in Tehachapi, Calif., to the Sepilok Rehabilitation
Centre in the Malaysian section of Borneo in March 1999. Animals at
the reserve--mostly orphaned or injured orangutans--are allowed to
roam freely.  "I didn't want to infringe on her space, so I walked up
quietly, snapped the photo and backed away," Novinger says. The
primates' most surprising trait? "They were calmer than I expected."</CP>

<HD>Grouped to Go: Is a Tour for You?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHARINE HAMM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's but one correct answer to the question of whether you should
take a group tour, travel experts say: It depends.</LD>
<LD>   With help from the pros, here are some of the questions you need
to answer--definitively--before you decide to go with a group.</LD>
<LD>   * Do you want to leave the planning to someone else? Getting a
plane ticket and reserving a hotel are easy to do on your own or with
the help of a travel agent. "But for multiple stops, all-inclusive
packages may be the way to go," says Robert Whitley, president of the
United States Tour Operators Assn., or USTOA, based in New York.</LD>
<TE>   * Do you enjoy togetherness? Group travel brings together a
community of interest, but that doesn't mean the participants will be
your new best friends. "People who don't enjoy the company of other
people" are not good candidates for a group trip, says Eilene Braun,
a vice president at Gate 1 Travel, based in Philadelphia. Remember
that you'll be with these people for a good part of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The "Vacation Personality Quiz" found on the USTOA Web page
ustoa.com/vacplanframe.htm will help you determine your traveling
style.</TE>
<TE>   * Is value a prime consideration? A tour can save you money. "My
guesstimation is between 15% and 20%" less than independent travel,
says Tish Agoyo, director of sales and marketing for EuroBound Tours,
a Los Angeles-based company.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to determine what's included, says Whitley of
USTOA, and to do a side-by-side comparison of what you would spend on
an independent trip and what your per-day costs will be for a group
trip.</TE>
<TE>   If you're unsure what your costs would be, check the State
Department site, www.state.gov, and type "per diem" into the search
engine. You can find foreign and, with a little more clicking,
domestic destinations with guidelines for costs of lodging plus meals
and incidental expenses.</TE>
<TE>   * Is learning about your destination a high priority? A group tour
can be a bit like Destination 101, especially with a knowledgeable
guide. Braun of Gate 1 says, "If you go yourself, you'll do less, see
less, learn less."</TE>
<TE>   * Can you deal with a schedule? If you like to sleep late or party
into the night, a "leaving-promptly-at-8" timetable may tax your
patience. You can sit out some group activities if you need a break.
Or if your real goal is just to get reduced air fare and hotel, you
can drop the group entirely. (Just let the guide know what you're
doing.)</TE>
<TE>   If you've answered yes to these questions, you're probably a good
candidate for a group trip. After determining the "whether," you must
determine the what and the where. Group travel is a $27
billion-a-year industry, so there is plenty to choose from.</TE>
<TE>   As you move to the next step, the experts recommend that you look
closely at the tour company by:</TE>
<TE>   * Checking with your travel agent and the Better Business Bureau
about the company.</TE>
<TE>   * Asking friends or family for recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   * Seeing whether a company is a member of USTOA (which requires a
million-dollar bond) or the American Society of Travel Agents.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We've opened our bag of Internet tricks and pulled out 30 sites that
savvy travelers may find handy now--or may pack away for future
reference. Some make vacation planning easier. Others make traveling
safer. And still others are simply tools for having a good time on
the road.</LD>
<LD>   The list isn't all-encompassing but a sample of favorites
suggested by the Travel section's writers and editors.</LD>
<LD>   In no particular order:</LD>

Federal Aviation Administration site, lists the three-letter codes

<LD>The trend is clear: The number of travelers turning to the Internet
for reservations is increasing rapidly. A national survey released
last month by marketing consultants Yankelovich Partners and
Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown showed that 32% of leisure travelers
used the Internet to make at least one reservation in the past 12
months. In the previous year's survey, the figure was 25%.</LD>
<LD>   We have compiled two lists of Internet sites that act as travel
agents, booking plane, hotel and car-rental reservations. The first
list shows the 10 most popular reservation sites based on the number
of people who visit them. These rankings are the latest monthly
figures compiled by the research group Nielsen/ NetRatings.</LD>
<LD>   The second list contains a dozen lesser-known sites suggested by
editors in the Travel section.</LD>
<TE>   In both cases, the sites may not necessarily offer prices that are
lower than what's available by contacting airlines, hotels and other
travel providers directly. Rules and restrictions vary site to site.
Consumers should consider an array of factors--cost savings,
convenience, refund policies, customer service (or lack
thereof)--before buying online.</TE>
<TE>   Individual travel providers, such as www.southwest.com (Southwest
Airlines) and www.marriott.com (Marriott hotels), have been excluded,
as have Web sites such as www.mapquest.com and www.smarterliving.com
that may offer useful information but do not actually book
reservations.</TE>
<TE>   10 MOST VISITED SITES</TE>
<TE>   1. www.expedia.com</TE>

<HD>Where to Complain and Get Results</HD>

<BD>From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What can a traveler do when a long-anticipated vacation turns into a
holiday headache?</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, when things go wrong and consumers seek an
explanation or apology from a hotel, airline or other travel service,
they often get neither on their first approach.</LD>
<LD>   But in many cases there's an agency out there that wants to hear
and count your complaints. The U.S. Department of Transportation, for
instance, compiles month-by-month figures on consumer air travel
gripes.</LD>
<TE>   It's far more rare, however, for an organization to do something
about travel problems, such as offering a refund or a credit toward a
future purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a list of public and private entities that track
travelers' complaints, beginning with local groups and concluding
with national ones. A few general rules:</TE>
<TE>   * Have a written account of your problem, succinct but as full of
detail and as devoid of emotion as possible. (Except for the
Department of Transportation, all of the groups below require that
complaints be in writing.)</TE>
<TE>   * Complain as soon as possible after the event.</TE>
<TE>   * When complaining directly to a travel company, say exactly what
compensation you want.</TE>
<TE>   * To register a complaint, begin with your travel agent, if you
used one. Next, write to the company that made you unhappy and keep a
copy of your letter. If the company replies, keep a copy of that too.
If you're dissatisfied with the response, consider contacting one or
more of the organizations listed below. Some experts say that writing
directly to the head of the company, rather than the customer service
department, gets better results.</TE>
<TE>   * If all you really want is a sincere apology, steel yourself for
disappointment. Tell your friends which company disappointed you and
how, and move on.</TE>
<TE>   Here are places to turn to when you have a travel-related problem:</TE>
<TE>   Travel Consumer Restitution Corp. This quasi-public state agency
was created in the mid-'90s to protect California consumers who book
certain travel services through California companies. A reserve fund
of more than $1 million has been established to reimburse travelers
who don't get paid-for services from a California-based travel
seller. For claim forms, contact the organization at P.O. Box 6001,
Larkspur, CA 94977- 6001; fax (415) 927-7698. (No public phone, Web
site or e-mail is available.)</TE>
<TE>   California attorney general. All travel agencies or others who
sell travel in California must register with the state and post a
bond or set up a trust account to guarantee funds will be available
to repay consumers if a trip is canceled or other services aren't
performed.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who want to check on the registration of a travel seller
(look for the CST number in ads), report an unregistered seller or
register a complaint can contact the office at 300 S. Spring St., Los
Angeles, CA 90013-1230; (213) 897-2645. They can also contact the
attorney general's Public Inquiry Unit, P.O. Box 944255, Sacramento,
CA 94244-2550; (800) 952-5225, fax (916) 323-5341,
www.caag.state.ca.us.</TE>
<TE>   American Society of Travel Agents. ASTA, a trade group, takes
complaints only about its member companies. ASTA says it tries to
mediate complaints and will tell inquiring consumers whether a member
has two or more unresolved complaints within the last six months.
Contact ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department, 1101 King St., Suite 200,
Alexandria, VA 22314; (703) 739-2782, fax (703) 684-8319,
www.astanet.com.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Tour Operators Assn. USTOA, another trade organization that
tracks complaints only about its members, reviews complaints and
forwards them to tour company executives. Contact USTOA at 275
Madison Ave., Suite 2014, New York, NY 10016; (212) 599-6599, fax
(212) 599-6744, www.ustoa.com.</TE>
<TE>   Better Business Bureau. For complaints or general information
about businesses in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, call (909) 825-7280, fax (909) 825-6246 or go to the
bureau's Web site, www.labbb.org. In Ventura, Santa Barbara and San
Luis Obispo counties, call (805) 963-8657, fax (805) 962-8557,
www.santabarbara.bbb.org.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Department of Transportation. This agency takes travelers'
complaints, mostly about airlines. Monthly figures, which can be seen
on the agency's Web site, track late flights, mishandled baggage,
oversold tickets (resulting in bumped passengers) and consumer
complaints. Contact Department of Transportation, C-75, Room 4107,
Washington, DC 20590; (202) 366-2220, www.dot.gov/airconsumer.</TE>
<TE>   PassengerRights.com. The Web site at www.passengerrights.com makes
it easier for travelers to lodge complaints with airlines and federal
officials. The site, born in April 1999, is a commercial venture
(aimed at winning paid subscribers to a newsletter), but its free
features are handy, especially the pages that demystify the workings
of the airline, cruise, rental car and hotel segments of the travel
industry. (Warning: Don't spend too much time browsing through the
site's collection of horror stories, or you'll be afraid to go
anywhere.)</TE>

<HD>Together Again</HD>
<DH>The 'L.A. Law' team has returned to the office for an NBC
movie. Just one little change: they're in Vancouver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corbin Bernsen had some concerns about returning to the law firm of
McKenzie-Brackman for NBC's "L.A. Law: The Movie." After all, it had
been eight years since Steven Bochco's Emmy Award-winning legal
series had left the airwaves. Bernsen didn't know if he would be able
to get back in the shoes of his colorful character, the womanizing
divorce lawyer Arnie Becker. "Eight years is a long time; does the
suit still fit?" he wondered.</LD>
<LD>   To his pleasure, Bernsen says, it fit like a beautifully tailored
Saville Row garment. In fact, he describes the experience as akin to
revisiting an old friend.</LD>
<LD>   "Really good friends, you don't even talk about what has happened"
in the intervening years, he says. "You don't even have to comment on
the changes, you are just comfortable with it. Not only do I feel
like that with this character, I feel it with the other characters."</LD>
<TE>   Harry Hamlin, who departed the series after five seasons as the
honest, straight-laced attorney Michael Kuzak, had left his character
far behind. But he agreed to return because William Finkelstein, a
former executive producer and writer on the series, was set to pen
the script.</TE>
<TE>   "The cast coming back was another part of it," Hamlin adds. "One
of the reasons why the show was so successful is that it painted a
canvas that was filled with a lot of different colors, and each
character represented one of those colors. If you didn't have all of
those colors back, I didn't think it would work."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Dey, who played Dist. Atty. Grace Van Owen for six seasons,
was thrilled with what Finkelstein did with the characters. "He is
not picking up where people left off," she says. "The law firm has
continued, and all of these characters have continued and he's just
opening the door and saying, 'You want to see where they are today?'
Here they are."</TE>
<TE>   The movie finds Kuzak running one of L.A's hottest restaurants,
having left his legal career behind because he was disillusioned. But
he returns to his former profession when the daughter of a convicted
police killer he once represented pleads with him to handle the man's
death-penalty appeal. His opposing counsel just happens to be Van
Owen, who is also his former lover.</TE>
<TE>   At McKenzie-Brackman, meanwhile, the rigid Douglas Brackman (Alan
Rachins) is operating the firm since the retirement of Leland
McKenzie (Richard Dysart). Married attorneys Ann Kelsey (Jill
Eikenberry) and Stuart Markowitz (Michael Tucker) learn that their
spiritual guru has left them bankrupt. Office manager Roxanne (Susan
Ruttan) is suddenly drawn back into the life of her ex-husband, and
Becker is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his estranged wife,
who is represented by former McKenzie-Brackman associate Abby Perkins
(Michele Greene). Office assistant Benny (Larry Drake) is still
helping to keep the firm running smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Finkelstein says he wouldn't have been interested in writing the
movie if it were to be solely an exercise in nostalgia. "The stories
really needed to have some legitimate, dramatic effect as opposed to
just being where they are now," he says. "I think that would have
thinned out quick. Once it became an opportunity to write for these
actors who I love and to sort of factor in the passing of time....
The characters are all different. I tried to make that part of the
story."</TE>
<TE>   Noticeably missing is original cast member Jimmy Smits, who played
attorney Victor Sifuentes. "I had always known that Jimmy was sort of
iffy about it," Finkelstein says. "He had other things going on."</TE>
<TE>   Another thing different about this "L.A. Law": As with many TV
movies these days, it was filmed in Canada for financial reasons.
When Hamlin learned it was to be shot in Vancouver, British Columbia,
he says, "I suggested they change it to 'B.C. Law.' I was not happy
about it."</TE>
<TE>   But Bernsen says there was an advantage to shooting out of town.
"We were all on location together, and every night we went out," he
explains. "We had these fabulous dinners and talks. Where if we would
have been here, everyone would have gone home at night."</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. Law: The Movie" can be seen Sunday at 9 p.m. on NBC. The
network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under the
age of 14).</TE>

<LD>I have no fondness for rap, but I thought the article on N.W.A
might be interesting reading nonetheless ("Parental Advisory: Explicit
Lyrics," by Terry McDermott, April 14). Once I read it, the only thing
that came to mind was a lyric from another song that was, as far as I
know, very popular among rap fans: "Don't believe the hype."</LD>
<LD>   Tom Orr</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why do a cover story on N.W.A without showing how much damage it did?
This misguided musical junta did the Ku Klux Klan's work with its
genocidal ethos of black men killing black men, blacks abhorring their
own women and hating themselves. "Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that,
and I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back . . . ." Are these the
words of "Papa Doc" Duvalier? No, they're from Dr. Dre.</TE>
<TE>   Cursed lyrics such as these work like a voodoo spell on the weak minds
of at-risk youth. They helped turn our communities of color into
terrorist zones long before 9/11, with kids running wild and blowing away
each other and innocent bystanders. I suppose it's no coincidence that
the words "Los Angeles Times Magazine" and "N.W.A" on the magazine cover
are written in blood red.</TE>

<TE>   McDermott does not get it. When Johnny Cash sang, "I shot a man in
Reno just to watch him die," his listeners knew that a character was
speaking. The young, impressionable listeners of gangsta rap believe that
the rappers themselves are living their lyrics of violence and misogyny.
The murders of famous rappers such as Tupac Shakur, and the convictions
and near convictions of major gangsta rap stars on both coasts, seem to
confirm that impression. McDermott is wrong in his assertion that the
rappers are simply misunderstood hedonistic artists like the Beach Boys.
The Beach Boys may have popularized hot rods and surfing through their
music; gangsta rap stars have popularized murder and mayhem in
communities across America.</TE>

<LD>Was James Ricci's goal to have me weep for parolees and gasp at the
costs of locking them up ("Humanity, and the Costs of Locking Up
Parolees," Metropolis, April 21)? Is committing an armed robbery or a
burglary simply a "mistake"? If most parolees return to their life of
crime and drug use, maybe doing away with parole and having them serve
their entire sentence is the answer. I feel more for the vast majority
who don't commit crimes and are victims. Simply ask the victims of armed
robbery or burglary what their views are. There are costs with
everything. One has to decide which costs are worth it.</LD>

<HD>Searching for Clues to the L.A. Riots</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I eagerly dove into Peter H. King's article "Searching for a
Legacy" (April 21). I am very disappointed in what I found. King's
strongest analysis of the cause of the 1992 Los Angeles riots is
"frustration and self-defeating anger and an instinct for anarchy." An
instinct for anarchy? Although the article refers to the Rodney King
beating, it only briefly touches on the verdict in favor of the police
officers who carried out the beating. King assumes that his audience
knows this information, but many young adults may not or would not be
able to infer it from his quote from Vera Tenenbaum: "It was after the
King trial, Rodney King."</LD>
<LD>   In fairness, he quotes Cornel West, a highly respected African
American intellectual who describes the urban uprising as a "display of
justified social rage" that signifies "the sense of powerlessness in
American society." Later he quotes Michael Cocquia: "It wasn't just
Rodney King. There were a whole lot of brutality building up to it." But
what do these quotes mean? What is the basis for the social rage? What
brutality? Because King does not bother to offer any background
information on the dearth of jobs and the level of poverty in the area,
what we have is a racially biased analysis of the cause of the uprising.
We conclude that the cause is an "instinct for anarchy" among those
involved.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A congenital bone disease kept Richard Quinn the size of a
10-year-old and took him from ambulatory to cane-dependent to
wheelchair-bound. The disease, Ehrenfried's syndrome, did not, however,
diminish his determination.</LD>
<LD>   Richard was determined about a number of things. He was determined to
be independent and self-supporting, and determined to help a troubled
boy, the son of people he knew. He was determined, too, to be a part of
the movie business. Working as a police dispatcher and an Amtrak
reservation-taker, he clung to the edges of the film industry and hoped
one day to be allowed inside.</LD>
<LD>   In 1979, a man named Eugene Mandelcorn advertised in The Recycler for
spec scripts for a low-budget cable TV series he called "The Sandman." It
involved a vigilante who captured criminals by putting them to sleep with
a special gun. Richard submitted a script that Eugene liked. Eugene even
let Richard direct the episode he wrote.</LD>
<TE>   "The Sandman" didn't exactly give Steven Bochco nightmares about lost
ratings points, but Richard and Eugene, who works at the Los Angeles
Central Library, became friends. In 1990, they teamed up to do a
Siskel-and-Ebert-type show on local-access cable TV. It was called
"Hollywood Unseen Videos" and was devoted to what Richard once called
on-air "the B-movies, the Z-movies, the films the big guys wouldn't even
want to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   On a video of one show from 1990, Richard and Eugene assay films with
such names as "Ghost Dance," "The Doorman," and "Ozone! Attack of the
Redneck Mutants." The tape shows Richard to be a handsome, dwarfish man,
attired in a red-and-white striped golf shirt and a white necktie
depicting Canada geese. His cane lies across his lap. He is well-spoken
and keeps popping his small, round hands together delightedly as he
assails "Redneck Mutants."</TE>
<TE>   Richard's disease progressed through the mid-1990s, and eventually he
could no longer do his work. Amtrak let him go after a career of 13
years. In 1998, Richard finished a screenplay for an animated feature
film he called "The Dolphins of Pompeii." It is a fanciful, emotional
tale in which a pod of dolphins saves the children of the doomed city
after Mt. Vesuvius erupts in the year 79.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, 1998 was a disaster. That year the troubled teenage boy
whose guardian he'd become robbed Richard and beat him so severely that
he had to be hospitalized. After his release, he had to vacate the
comfortable Culver City apartment he'd lived in for two decades because
the building was to be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene drove him all over Los Angeles to find affordable lodging
appropriate for Richard's diminishing capabilities. They could find
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Richard became a street-dweller. He grew unkempt and his personal
hygiene deteriorated. Each day he took a bus to Beverly Hills and begged
for money around Nate-N-Al's Delicatessen on Beverly Drive. Whenever his
wheelchair battery failed, Richard called Eugene on the cell phone Eugene
had given him, and Eugene would pick him up in his car. Despite his woes,
Richard kept his sharpness of mind and became a familiar sight in Beverly
Hills. Through a friend, film director Tom Shadyac learned of "The
Dolphins of Pompeii" and optioned it from Richard for $1,500--manna from
heaven. Shadyac bought the option partly because he thought the story had
potential and partly because he wanted to give the dilapidating man in
the wheelchair a boost.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Arlook of the Gersh Agency breakfasted regularly at
Nate-N-Al's, and he gave Richard a dollar each time he encountered him.
One day, Richard asked him to read his screenplay. Arlook thought, "Oh,
boy . . . ." The screenplay, however, surprised the agent, who, reasoning
that helping Richard would be good for his own karma, circulated "The
Dolphins of Pompeii" to DreamWorks and Disney, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Richard was living off and on in a transient hotel on the edge of skid
row. His prospects worsening by the day, he pressed Shadyac for results.
The director tried to get him to understand that "these things take
time." Richard, however, did not have the luxury of waiting out
Hollywood's desultory ways.</TE>
<TE>   In early March, Nate-N-Al's regulars began noticing Richard's absence.
Eugene tried calling on the cell phone. No answer.</TE>
<TE>   A housekeeper found Richard dead in his room March 14. He had died,
apparently of natural causes, at age 56. After the coroner's office
removed his body, somebody kicked in the door to his room and stole his
remaining possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Shadyac was unable to make anything happen with "The Dolphins of
Pompeii." Those to whom Arlook sent the screenplay eventually passed.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Dolphins of Pompeii," a crippled 10-year-old boy and a dolphin
disabled in a shark attack combine to pull off the great rescue. The boy
and the other children are transported on the backs of dolphins to a
place of peace, joy and riches, and the lame boy and the handicapped
dolphin are relieved of their infirmities.</TE>
<TE>   Richard's body is still at the coroner's, awaiting cremation.</TE>
<TE>   A Web site features a detailed treatment of "The Dolphins of Pompeii."
It's at http://www.idowebpages.com/dolphin.html. Maybe someone else in
Hollywood will give it a look.</TE>

<LD>Couture is dead--or so goes the conventional wisdom as Yves Saint
Laurent and other great fashion houses put their astronomically priced,
one-of-a-kind designs into mothballs. But hand-craftsmanship and
exquisite draping live on in the workshops of young designers who are
finding creative ways to honor the masters affordably.</LD>
<LD>   Case in point: Claire Joseph. Since its June 2001 opening, Joseph's
Yucca Street shop and atelier in the revitalized Hollywood district has
won hearts among actresses, stylists and adventurous dressers with
tailored, glamorous pieces that the designer creates on the premises
using two vintage sewing machines (a 1955 Elna and a 1957 Bernina).</LD>
<LD>   Joseph's aesthetic honors an aristocratic, high-society past along
with a punk revival, Bauhaus-inspired present. Three-quarter-length coats
and spirally draped gowns of $900-per-yard vintage fabric update Audrey
Hepburn and Grace Kelly, while a one-piece spiral-draped skirt and mesh
long-sleeved tee have Gwen Stefani written all over them.</LD>
<TE>   The aforementioned spiral draping is Joseph's specialty and her homage
to the great American couturier Charles James, who raised cutting and
fitting to a sculptural art form (suffering dire financial consequences)
from the '30s through the '50s. Joseph, 42, was introduced to James'
oeuvre while studying with his protege Michael Butler, and became
"obsessed with making everything out of a single piece of fabric," she
says. Joseph uses the figure-flattering technique for many pieces,
cutting on the bias and darting and seaming loose fabric to achieve a
tailored garment. Fittings are included in Joseph's prices, which range
from $130 to $550 for ready-to-wear  dresses, and $400 to $3,000 for
couture or custom work.</TE>
<TE>   A passion for craftsmanship also comes across in vintage buttons,
linings made of vintage fabrics and finishing done with piping rather
than overlocking seams. Joseph hand-dyes most of her fabrics, a skill she
used while working for Italian designer Romeo Gigli; her current palette
includes burnt umber, titian, "grandma's soap pink," chartreuse, crimson
and blazing pumpkin.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 years of subsidizing her custom work by designing for
ready-to-wear labels, Joseph is reveling in full-time creative autonomy.
This year, she designed and made an Oscar gown for Jane Kaczmarek
("Malcolm in the Middle") and a tuxedo for Kaczmarek's husband, Bradley
Whitford ("The West Wing"). Future projects include a menswear line. For
the designer, it all comes down to creating "clothes for the individual
[to] leave room for their own personal expression." Spoken like a
couturier.</TE>

<LD>Invited to: "A Roller Disco--Moroccan Style" party debuting
Skechers' 4 Wheelers skates at the Hollywood Palladium.</LD>
<LD>   Let the good times roll:"They told me to wear these," says first-time
skater Christina Ricci, indicating the special Tracey Ross-designed
calf-high buckskin skates that match her "cheapo fake suede" skirt
nicely. To celebrate the release of Skechers' new sneakers on wheels, the
company turned the Palladium into a giant Roll-a-Rama and issued free
skates to all comers (though only celebrity females receive the deluxe
buckskin variety). The bash draws the likes of '90s It girls Daphne
Zuniga and Tia Carrere, cute rock-brat couple Sean Lennon and Bijou
Phillips, models Ivana Milicevic and Molly Sims, plus musical acts O-Town
and Usher, all of whom join in the four-wheel fun. Even Limp Bizkit lead
man Fred Durst does his laps, pronouncing the experience "smooth." Of
course, there's always somebody who thinks he's too cool for school--in
this case, Vincent Gallo, who hangs around the rink's perimeter but
militantly refuses to roll. "Would Elvis roller-skate?" he asks
rhetorically. "No. Would the Fonz roller-skate? No." Note to Vince: Not
only did the Fonz roller-skate, Henry Winkler referred to the episode
("Fonzie's Hero") as one of his favorites. So there.</LD>
<TE>   Act your age and your shoe size: "I'm gonna leave if I can't find
skates my size," pouts Gina Gershon, dressed a la Joan Jett (her co-star
in the soon-to-be-released film "Prey For Rock and Roll") in black jeans
and tee. But she is soon snugly roller-shod and spends the rest of the
evening happily cruising around the hall. Taking a break in the comfy
Moroccan-themed lounge is Daryl Hannah, who has discovered that her
skates are too large. Hannah is also trying to score one of those
clasp-on flashing lights everyone seems to be wearing. "It's a cool thing
to wear to warn people that you're coming," she says. Although in her
case, that's hardly necessary since she's in formidable shape (spending
nine hours a day practicing martial arts for the upcoming Tarantino opus,
"Kill Bill") and attracting everybody's attention anyway. Not that
accidents can't happen. "I almost went down on someone's vodka; that was
really lame," says Danny Masterson of "That '70s Show." Indeed, one of
the night's most spectacular spills occurs courtesy of Skechers president
Robert Greenberg. As the old maxim goes, those who can, do. Those who
can't, teach. And those who can't teach, apparently, supply the product.</TE>
<TE>   Celeb Quotient: ** Lots of familiar names whirling around, though
distinctions between soap stars and movie stars, not to mention has-beens
and will-bes, are easily blurred.</TE>
<TE>   Wow Factor: *** Free skates. Wheeee!</TE>
<TE>   Grazing Level: ** Mini hot dogs and PB&amp;J give it the roller disco
touch, while hummus and shish kebabs add the Moroccan flavor. Not quite a
pasha's feast, but certainly not rinky-dink.</TE>

<LD>Sure, Andy Warhol was a groundbreaking Pop artist, but he was also
a compulsive  gadabout who would "attend the opening of an envelope,"
according to one wag.  On Warhol's L.A. junkets, art and life went
mano-a-mano as Andy trolled for famous faces like a Midwestern tourist
with a map of the stars' homes. To celebrate the Warhol retrospective at

<LD>George Wilson picked up the trombone as an eighth-grader, but
virtuosity on auto parts and old appliances took him another 50 years. In
about l985, when visiting a piano teacher friend, he says, "I saw she had
a real cow horn, and I tried to see if I could get some sounds out of it.
I got three or four different notes and she gave me the horn." Once home,
he thought, "Man, I'm going to try a trombone mouthpiece on this!"</LD>
<LD>   Ever since, the 78-year-old proprietor of Wilson's Auto Service and
Dinosaur Repair in Ojai has been playing music on objects including, but
not limited to, stove broiler burners, wheel cylinders, transmissions,
flashlights, auto horns, carburetors and plastic dinosaurs.</LD>
<LD>   How exactly do you get a recognizable tune out of a plastic dinosaur?
As Wilson explains it, any more-or-less hollow object can be an
instrument, given the right mouthpiece. His method is to rig a trombone
mouthpiece onto a 3/8-inch-diameter fuel hose, which goes into a hole in
the object being played. "It acts as a pre-amp and makes everything
louder. If the hole is too big, I bridge the gap with other rubber
bushings used on car suspensions." Sounding different notes, Wilson says,
is all in the lip muscles. (As for the dinosaur, it was part of a set
Wilson's wife put together in honor of the shop's name, which refers to
his work on vintage cars.)</LD>
<TE>   Wilson concedes that audience feedback has been mixed. "I've played
for people of all ages and they are enthralled at first, but then they
lose enthusiasm," he says. He often plays on a Model T bulb horn for a
half-dozen friends with whom he goes on hunting trips. "They kind of like
it and are beginning to tolerate me more."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's concert career may be picking up, however. He played a
plastic dinosaur in Ojai's 1999 Fourth of July parade, and in February of
2000, he played auto parts at "Adoorable U," a show in Ojai of art
created on old Volkswagen doors. That same year, a local sixth-grade
class taped a performance of Wilson with accordionist and teacher Frank
Umbro. Though he favors popular music from between 1938 and 1942, Wilson
is loaded for bear with a wide repertoire that includes a rendition of
the Beatles' "Yesterday" on a water-heater part. "I'm available!" he
says.</TE>

<DH>The Muscleman-Turned-Actor Wants to Make the Leap Into Politics.
But the Hollywood Press Never Played Hardball. How Strong Is He Really?</DH>

<LD>It is late February in the San Fernando Valley, on a morning that
feels like springtime. As the sun beams, a small brown-gray ribbon of
smog embroiders the horizon, the only thing marring an otherwise
motion-picture perfect day. Inside the auditorium of Hart Street
Elementary School, two dozen boys and girls in matching T-shirts are
sitting, shrieking. "Let's join Arnold!" they shout, over and over, past
the rattle and clomp of camera operators arriving and setting up their
clanking equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Outside hovers a retinue of earnest men and women, their brows
uniformly creased as they chatter into cell phones and busy themselves
with clipboards and stacks of glossy white press kits. "One minute out,"
comes a warning, and 60 seconds later a black GMC Yukon sails to the
front of the school auditorium. Out steps Arnold Schwarzenegger.</LD>
<LD>   He has come to Hart Street elementary, a cheery oasis in this tatty
corner of Canoga Park, to debut his newest starring role, as impresario
and chief sponsor of a statewide ballot measure promoting after-school
programs. His massive frame is stuffed inside a royal blue blazer, blue
dress shirt and white jeans; a striped rep tie and thick-soled alligator
lace-ups finish off the well-turned-out preppy look. Schwarzenegger
disembarks from the Yukon and briefly stops by the school office before
proceeding to the computer lab.</LD>
<TE>   Awaiting him there are seven television cameras, four still
photographers, two radio reporters, a handful of newspaper writers and
Schwarzenegger's personal photographer and camera crew, a swarm that
easily outnumbers the 10 students seated in front of monitors, oversized
headphones clamped to their tiny heads. After some brief, stilted small
talk, Schwarzenegger proceeds to the school library (more kids in
T-shirts, more awkward small talk), then finally arrives back at the
auditorium, where he enters to a chorus of, "Let's join Arnold!"</TE>
<TE>   After a brief laudatory introduction, Schwarzenegger steps before a
bouquet of microphones and speaks. He is not here to discuss building
muscles, says the world's most famous muscleman-turned-movie-Goliath, but
"something much, much more important." He then proceeds to lay out the
details of his proposed ballot initiative, offering a fluent discourse on
after-school care in California and the problems of at-risk youth,
footnoted with references to academic studies and his lengthy involvement
helping underprivileged kids. Afterward, fielding questions from
reporters, he deftly discusses the state's budget crunch--the initiative
would not take effect before 2004, and only then if fiscal conditions
allow--and smoothly deflects queries about his oft-stated political
ambitions. "I only see one thing right now," he says. "That is every
school has after-school programs."</TE>
<TE>   In all, it is a fairly lackluster performance. Much of the
presentation, such as the talk of teen pregnancy, is clearly not intended
for this fidgety young audience, which serves, really, as little more
than a prop for the TV cameras. Schwarzenegger finishes by tossing off a
halfhearted "I'll be back," delivering one of his cinematic signature
lines with all the verve of a mumbled aside.</TE>
<TE>   But that night, on the local evening news, a transformation takes
place. A report on the ballot measure portrays the actor not as
Hollywood's smash-'em-up hero, not as one of the most lethal attractions
in movie history, but rather as a serious policy thinker, an authority
even in the area of families and children. "Arnold Schwarzenegger," reads
the on-screen identifier. "Education Activist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I believe very strongly in the philosophy of staying hungry. If you
have a dream and it becomes a reality, don't stay satisfied too long.
Make up a new dream and hunt after that one and turn it into a reality."
--Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1980 book "American Dreams, Lost and
Found."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger would like to be California governor someday. Or
perhaps a United States senator. He makes little secret of his political
aspirations, which he has harbored for a long time. He thought of running
for governor this year, backing out of the Republican primary only after
weeks of deliberation. During that period, in the winter and early spring
of 2001, he met several times with the brain trust that guided former GOP
Gov. Pete Wilson's political career. He received quiet encouragement from
the Bush White House. He also got a small taste of the difference between
the cushioned world of Hollywood celebrity and the two-by-four treatment
he could face as a celebrity office-seeker. Ultimately, Schwarzenegger
bowed out of the contest, citing irrevocable business obligations,
including a contract to start filming "Terminator 3." But it was just a
matter of time, he suggested, until he ran for office. "I have to keep up
my end of the deal," he said ruefully of his work commitments. "It's not
like it could have gone this way or that."</TE>
<TE>   Those professional obligations aside, his team of veteran campaign
advisors warned Schwarzenegger against a precipitous plunge into
politics. Of all the folklore surrounding Ronald Reagan, one of the most
fanciful notions is the idea that the B-movie actor stepped right off the
screen into a successful race for governor. In truth, Reagan spent well
over a decade preparing for his 1966 campaign against incumbent Democrat
Pat Brown, including several years giving speeches around the country as
a free-enterprise ambassador for General Electric.</TE>
<TE>   The late U.S. Sen. George Murphy, a song-and-dance man who preceded
Reagan moving from stage to stump (and who later served as a political
confidant) also spent years as a political apprentice. Like Reagan, he
fought Communists in Hollywood as head of the Screen Actors Guild, then
grew more active in Republican politics, serving as chairman of the state
GOP and as a high-profile supporter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Schwarzenegger was told, he needed to start building a
political profile if he hoped to be taken seriously as a candidate for
office. "There are steps you need to do to steep yourself in state
politics and state issues and to introduce yourself in an intelligent
way, as opposed to a flash in the pan," says Sean Walsh, a member of the
Wilson team who spent the early part of last year on standby in the event
of a Schwarzenegger candidacy. The team advised the aging action hero "to
take a slow and steady approach, as opposed to just bursting onto the
scene," Walsh says.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger and his political counselors discussed various ways and
means of launching his political career. Standing up for campaign finance
reform was one possibility. The state's erupting electricity crisis also
presented an opportunity to weigh in. But education reform seemed to make
the most sense; it had the virtues of saliency--the subject perennially
tops the list of voter concerns--and it meshed with Schwarzenegger's long
involvement in youth issues. It would also soften the image of an actor
responsible, by one count, for more than 275 on-screen murders.</TE>
<TE>   Thus was born the After School Education and Safety Program Act of
2002, destined for a vote on Nov. 5 and millions of dollars in
advertising before then--much of it likely featuring Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot initiative process is one of California's proud legacies of
the Progressive Era. The intention was to break the stranglehold of
special interests, embodied by the hated Southern Pacific Railroad, and
to give private citizens a greater role in their governance by letting
voters enact the laws they live by. It still works that way, in an
idealized sense. But the system has also been exploited by special
interests and used more than once as a vehicle for personal ambition.</TE>
<TE>   The 54-year-old Schwarzenegger declined to be interviewed for this
article. Others associated with the initiative also would not speak or,
in some instances, were forbidden from speaking. "There will be a lot of
speculation about his political aspirations," acknowledges Don Sipple,
the media consultant who worked for Wilson and was tapped to produce the
advertising for Schwarzenegger's initiative campaign. "Partly because of
the lack of Republican success in California in recent years. Part of it
has to do with his political views stated over a period of years. The
only thing for certain is that he is the leading force behind a very
mainstream initiative. While the speculation may be wild or rampant, one
needs to just look at the efforts he's making this year."</TE>
<TE>   During a brief, cordial conversation after a March appearance at the
Reagan presidential library, Schwarzenegger explained his concerns about
openly discussing his political future. The actor came to Simi Valley to
unveil a bust of the former president he commissioned, presenting the
likeness before a doting audience of Republican dignitaries, including
ex-Gov. Wilson. Schwarzenegger said he was sincere about improving the
state of after-school programs in California, even recruiting Democratic
co-sponsors to boost prospects for passage of his ballot measure. (Among
them, Democratic Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, a likely contestant for
governor in 2006.) Anything that suggested partisan motives or, worse,
self-dealing would only muddy the issue and complicate efforts to pass
the proposal, Schwarzenegger explained.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rationale both savvy and somewhat naive. Savvy to the extent
that it recognizes the political appeal of a ballot measure with a
bipartisan gloss and a sponsor acting out of pure altruistic intent. But
naive, as well, in that it supposes Schwarzenegger can step into the
political realm and avoid talking about his obvious political ambitions.
Indeed, one of the first questions from reporters at the Reagan
library--as at Hart Street elementary school--is about Schwarzenegger's
eventual plans to seek office. Again, he turns the question back to a
discussion of his ballot measure. "After we cross that bridge," he says,
"we can talk about the next step."</TE>
<TE>   But privately, several people who have discussed politics with
Schwarzenegger say the initiative campaign is a "trial balloon," as one
put it, for an eventual run for office. It would most likely be a bid for
governor in 2006, should GOP nominee Bill Simon Jr. lose in November--as
many of those around Schwarzenegger are supposing. Or perhaps he may run
for the U.S. Senate in 2004, when Democrat Barbara Boxer faces
reelection. "A ballot initiative needs a candidate," said Chad Griffin, a
campaign strategist who helped actor-director Rob Reiner pass a 1998
measure slapping a tax on tobacco products to pay for child development
programs. "Arnold will in essence be the candidate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to be a champion, you cannot have any kind of negative
force coming in affect(ing) you. I've trained myself to be totally cold
and not have these things go into my mind."--Arnold Schwarzenegger in the
1976 film "Pumping Iron."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger has faced all kinds of nemeses in his movie
career. He has been shot, stabbed, run over, burned, crushed, melted and
had his memory erased by Martian forces. He has even been impregnated.
But Schwarzenegger has never encountered anything like Garry South.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when Schwarzenegger was contemplating a campaign for
governor, South faxed a series of smart-mouthed statements to political
reporters across the country, calling attention to articles in the
National Enquirer and Premiere magazine that described the married actor
as a serial groper, a boor and habitual womanizer. There were angry
denials from Schwarzenegger and his Hollywood supporters, denunciations
from Republican quarters and dark threats of legal action. South, the
chief election strategist for Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, was delighted.
"The response indicated to me the exact answer I was trying to find out,"
South says. "He had a very thin skin. He overreacted to things like
this." South is sitting in a hotel coffee shop in San Diego,
gesticulating wildly, the way he often does whenever words seem
insufficient to explain his thoughts. "This wasn't a TV spot, for God
sake, this was a fax that was sent out to maybe a couple hundred
reporters. This was nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is a confection factory, spinning fantasy and then using its
massive machinery to perpetuate its myths. In the process, celebrities
are often coddled by reporters who glorify their subjects and pay ransom
for the privilege-- trading favorable coverage and preferred story
placement in exchange for access.</TE>
<TE>   If Schwarzenegger makes the leap into politics, he will enter a whole
other world, a place where enemies stoke an adversarial press corps,
where reporters wear their skepticism proudly, and where character is not
a role but the measure of a person to be publicly, minutely scrutinized.
Andy Spahn, a senior executive at DreamWorks studio, spent 20 years in
politics, working for Davis and former presidential hopeful Gary Hart,
among others. On more than one occasion he has sat down with a celebrity
having political ambitions and told them, essentially, the following:
"Before you go too far in your thought process, take a good look at
yourself, your lifestyle, and understand that if you enter this arena,
everything you've done becomes fair game. You may think as a celebrity
you've given up a great deal of your privacy, but you ain't seen nothing
yet. Every aspect of your life may be called into question. Look at the
positions and statement you've made over the years. Imagine what could be
done with them in the political arena. Look at your life through a
microscope. Are you prepared to have all of this laid bare?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, in Schwarzenegger's case there is much in his life story
that could have been scripted by Hollywood's merchants of make-believe.</TE>
<TE>   After growing up poor in Austria, he arrived in America in 1968 with
scarcely more than a gym bag and his dreams. They were, as he told one
early patron, "to be the greatest bodybuilder in the world, the greatest
bodybuilder of all time, and the richest bodybuilder in the world. I want
to live in the United States and own an apartment block and be a film
star. Ultimately, I want to be a producer."</TE>
<TE>   He accomplished those goals and more--more perhaps than even he dared
imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger won 13 world bodybuilding titles, becoming the youngest
Mr. Universe in history at age 20. He became a celebrity thanks to
"Pumping Iron," a cult film that introduced the world to a charming
conniver and self-promotional genius with, literally, muscles on top of
muscles. From there he graduated to a series of movie roles demanding
more brawn than brainpower, achieving international superstardom in 1984
with "The Terminator," a role with only 17 spoken lines. Within a decade,
Schwarzenegger had become Hollywood's biggest box-office draw and the
world's highest-paid actor; even now, after a series of flops,
Schwarzenegger will command $30 million for reprising his cyborg role in
"Terminator 3."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, he made a fortune in real estate, putting a University
of Wisconsin correspondence degree in business and economics to brilliant
use; at one time or another, Schwarzenegger has owned or co-owned
virtually every building along Santa Monica's fashionably funky Main
Street. On top of all that, he completed his ascendancy to America's
A-list in 1986 when he joined the nation's royal family, marrying Kennedy
cousin Maria Shriver. The couple live with their four children in a
sprawling home in Pacific Palisades, near Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   But Schwarzenegger has not only done well, he has done good. He plays
a prominent role in the Special Olympics, founded by Shriver's mother,
Eunice. In 1991, he launched the Inner City Games, an enrichment program
for disadvantaged kids that started in Los Angeles and has spread to more
than a dozen American cities. As chairman of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness in the first Bush administration ("Conan the
Republican," Bush called him), Schwarzenegger personally financed a
private jet and entourage of experts that toured all 50 states. He has
committed $1 million to his state ballot initiative and fronted hundreds
of thousands more to launch Arnold's All-Stars, an after-school program
for middle-school children in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great success story," says David Foster, who produced
"Collateral Damage," Schwarzenegger's latest film. "A guy comes to the
United States, becomes a humongous international star, marries into
Camelot. It has all the elements."</TE>
<TE>   But a rather less flattering portrait emerges in "Arnold," a decidedly
unauthorized 1990 biography. Among other unsavory details, the book
recounts that Schwarzenegger's late father, Gustav, was a member of the
Nazi Party. The work, by journalist Wendy Leigh, also includes detailed
allegations of womanizing, cruel practical jokes, extensive use of
steroids in his bodybuilding days and suggestions that the actor made
racist and anti-Semitic remarks as a young man. Schwarzenegger denounced
the book as trash. But James Willwerth, a Time correspondent who profiled
Schwarzenegger for the magazine, told the Columbia Journalism Review that
he checked Leigh's research, using her 34 pages of source notes as a
guide, and considered her work "well reported. My nose told me that the
book was on target."</TE>
<TE>   Wherever the truth lies, the response to Leigh's dishy biography was
instructive. At the 1990 Cannes film festival, reporters wishing to cover
Schwarzenegger were asked to sign an agreement promising not to ask about
the book. "That issue had been completely dealt with in various different
outlets," explains Charlotte Parker, a former Schwarzenegger publicist
who imposed the reporting requirement as a condition for attending a
breakfast buffet with the star. "I didn't want every single person to
reinvent the wheel."</TE>
<TE>   Leigh, who was shunned by Schwarzenegger and his intimates while
writing the biography, claims she was further blackballed when she set
out to publicize her work. Television appearances were canceled,
interviews were scrubbed and newspaper articles were spiked, according to
Leigh. "I found out through intermediaries that publicists were told if
they put me on, Arnold wouldn't do their show," says the author, speaking
by telephone from her home in London. "He made absolutely sure no one had
anything to do with" the book. But Parker denies any involvement in
Leigh's promotional difficulties. "I don't know where that came from,"
Parker says. "I did not call anyone and request that."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the rules of engagement could not be more different in a
political campaign. Handlers may limit access to a candidate.
Office-seekers will often try to duck uncomfortable questions. But the
time is long past when someone seeking high public office can shield
their indiscretions from a none-too-inquisitive press corps, the way John
F. Kennedy managed. One of California's most practiced Republican
strategists suggests that in this age of 24-hour news programming and
post- Monica sensibilities, candidates have to assume that anything they
try to conceal will eventually come out. "I'd give him the same speech I
give every candidate that sits down for the first time" to talk about a
potential campaign, the strategist says of Schwarzenegger. "I ask, 'Is
there anything about your life your wife doesn't know and you never want
her to find out?' "</TE>
<TE>   The actor himself is the only one who can say. But even if he has
nothing to hide, he may wonder: Who needs the aggravation? George Butler,
who produced and directed "Pumping Iron" and has been friends with
Schwarzenegger since, suggested, "He's got to make a choice about what
he's willing to put out there . . . . If Arnold is going to run for
public office, he's got to realize there's a tremendous amount of
baggage."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Butler calls Schwarzenegger "one of the most adaptable" and
single-minded individuals he has ever met. "He's going to know the ground
rules before he plays the game," Butler says, and if Schwarzenegger
decides to run for office, no amount of adversity will put him off.
"He'll keep coming back and coming back. If he can't make it one way, he
will figure out how to make it another way. He's very, very smart and
always has been."</TE>

friend."--Studio mogul Jack Warner upon learning of Reagan's plans to run
for governor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, the rank-and-file Republicans of California delivered a
thunderous rejection of Richard Riordan and his efforts to remake their
struggling party. The former Los Angeles mayor said the GOP needed to
abandon its hard-line stance on issues such as abortion, gun control and
gay rights, which put the party out of step with most live-and-let-live
Californians. Among Riordan's most ardent supporters was Schwarzenegger,
who argued that Bill Simon Jr., the landslide winner of the March
primary, could not possibly be elected governor. "There is no two ways
about it," Schwarzenegger said in an interview that aired election day on
CNN. "A conservative Republican will not win against Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Events may prove him wrong, which would obviously complicate any plans
to run for governor. But even if the field is wide open, a larger
question is whether someone with Schwarzenegger's left-of-center views
could win a Republican primary, notwithstanding his celebrity candle
power. "I don't think he gets a bye," says Michael Schroeder, an Orange
County attorney and former state Republican Party chairman, who is
already critical of Schwarzenegger for failing to reach out to
conservatives in pushing his after-school initiative.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Schwarzenegger's political profile is identical to
Riordan's. A self-described fiscal conservative, the actor also calls
himself "very liberal" on social programs. He favors legalized abortion,
"sensible gun controls"--including a ban on so-called assault
weapons--and adoption by gay parents. Last year, while weighing a bid for
governor, Schwarzenegger met with Gerry Parsky, the Westside businessman
who serves as President Bush's political boss in California. The two
talked at length "about the need for the Republican Party to reach out
for groups that feel left out, particularly minority groups," according
to Parsky, who has said the California GOP must shed its image as
"anti-education, anti-woman, anti-immigration" if Republicans hope to
start winning statewide again.</TE>
<TE>   (The White House may be less pleased with a statement Schwarzenegger
made last year, lavishing praise on the president but suggesting "it
would have been better if he had really won, instead of through the
courts.")</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger, like any celebrity candidate, would start out with
certain inherent advantages in a California contest, not the least his
enormous name recognition. That alone would spare the cost of millions of
dollars in statewide television advertising. But familiarity is just a
starting point for any candidate, famous or not. "It gives you an
opportunity to make your case," says Darrell West, a Brown University
professor and author of the forthcoming book "Celebrity Politics." Voters
"are not going to elect someone just because they saw them in a movie.
You still have to have a platform and you still have to make the sale."
Or as Dan Schnur, a veteran GOP communications consultant put it, "Voters
will take a much longer look at Arnold Schwarzenegger than they would at
Arnold Smith. But the impetus would still be on Schwarzenegger to take
advantage of that opportunity to tell them something about his agenda and
his priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Having witnessed the Riordan crack-up and with coaching from Wilson's
campaign team--the last Republican crew to win a top-of-the-ticket
California race, back in 1994--Schwarzenegger could presumably run a
smarter campaign than the ill-fated ex-mayor. "It's simply not rubbing
conservative noses in his position on social issues, which Pete
Wilson"--another abortion rights supporter--"knew how to do," says GOP
strategist Kevin Spillane, who helped coax Riordan into the governor's
race in hopes of pushing the California Republican Party closer to the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows what kind of wreck the state GOP will be if Simon loses to
Davis, as most analysts predict. The party was in similarly desperate
shape when Ronald Reagan came to the rescue nearly 40 years ago, a
parallel that invites further comparisons to Schwarzenegger as a
potential savior.</TE>
<TE>   But Reagan was riding a conservative wave--one he helped create--that
carried him to the governorship and, ultimately, swept him all the way to
the White House. A left-leaning Republican such as Schwarzenegger would
be swimming against the proverbial tide, at least starting out, which
would certainly be a lot tougher. "He's out of sync with Republican
primary voters," says Tony Quinn, one of California's most astute
political demographers. "They're older, whiter and much more nostalgic
for a time when we didn't talk about gay adoptions, we didn't talk about
abortion, we didn't talk about gun control."</TE>
<TE>   Reagan was also helped immeasurably by his affable screen image, a
fetching persona that carried over, with a crinkly-eyed smile and tilt of
his head, to real life. Stuart Spencer, the consultant who guided
Reagan's political career from the start, still remembers how the
neophyte candidate started with 90% name identification and 92% approval
among women. It all went back to the nice-guy roles he played in
Hollywood, Spencer says. "He wasn't threatening."</TE>
<TE>   Although Schwarzenegger started branching out in the late 1980s to
comedy and other more family-friendly fare (and even the Terminator
became a good guy in the sequel), he made his movie reputation--and
millions of dollars--starring in films that featured spectacular amounts
of violence. That would undoubtedly be an issue if he runs for office.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't think that there would be objections raised from people
saying, 'He says he's for children and yet has been involved in probably
more violent movies than anyone in Hollywood at the moment?' " asks
Democratic strategist Garry South. "That has an effect on kids, even if
it's a role,  even if he's acting pursuant to a script that's handed to
him. That's one of the complications in this business."</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics--or at least those who see things through a political
lens--are convinced Schwarzenegger's after-school initiative is the first
step in a refurbishment campaign aimed at positioning him for political
office. "It's kids, education, kinder, gentler," says Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, a USC political science professor who teaches a course on politics
and the movies. "This is not the guy who goes and blows up people. This
is the guy who cares about education and cares about policy. This is
'Kindergarten Cop.' "</TE>
<TE>   But for now, Schwarzenegger is sticking to his script, championing the
cause of children and saying nothing about how that may play into any
larger plans. In addition, he's focused on something that surely no other
candidate in history has ever worried about. As he told one interviewer
earlier this year, the opening scene of "Terminator 3"--as in the first
two installments--has his character appearing naked. After major heart
surgery five years ago and a nasty motorcycle spill in December,
Schwarzenegger is determined to show age and ailments have not taken any
serious toll. "I want to be in as good a shape as possible," he said. "I
don't want the character to be 12 years older than in the last movie, and
I can do that."</TE>
<TE>   A man who believes he can fool nature obviously has no lack of
self-confidence.</TE>

<HD>Navigating With a New Set of Stars</HD>
<DH>His Injury Was Devastating, but It was the Recovery That Changed
His Life</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT MASELLO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was sitting at the bus stop, on the corner of 26th Street and
Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica, when I saw myself drive by. The guy
at the wheel was about my age, wearing glasses and a baseball cap, and
the car--an old green BMW, the exact same model as mine--was just as
dirty as the one I drive.</LD>
<LD>   Only I wasn't driving anymore. I had to take the bus now, and even
that wasn't easy. About six months earlier, I had been in a bizarre, and
bad, accident involving an umbrella stand (unseen) and a concrete
walkway. Even my surgeon, after assessing the broken bones and nerve
damage, had declared my injuries "horrifying." At first I thought he was
kidding; then I realized he was not.</LD>
<LD>   For a time, I failed to realize that I had entered a new life. I'd
passed through the looking glass, and from now on, I'd be looking at
things from a completely different perspective.</LD>
<TE>   The guy driving by was just one more reminder of that. How many times
had I tooled by this very corner, in my own baseball hat, and never even
glanced at people like me, craning their necks for the next Big Blue Bus
or trying to decipher the incomprehensible schedule posted on the sign?
Why should I have? Until I was forced to, I'd never once taken a bus in
California. True, in New York I'd taken buses and subways everywhere, but
after my wife and I had moved to Los Angeles 10 years earlier, I'd bought
a used car--the first auto I'd ever owned--and I'd become used to driving
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The physical damage I sustained in the accident (to both arms and my
right leg) made driving impossible, just as it made impossible a whole
host of other, and even simpler, things. It wasn't the big stuff, really,
that brought me down. I accepted, however grudgingly, the loss of driving
privileges, the inability to throw a ball to the dog or sleep on my side
(as I had done all my life). What brought me up short, over and over
again, were those little unforeseen moments, when inconsequential things
suddenly stopped me in my tracks and posed insurmountable obstacles. You
have no idea how many things in your life you take for granted until you
can't floss your teeth, wash your hair or get a coffee mug out of the
cupboard by yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Once, just to show my wife I could still pitch in around the house, I
decided to run a load of laundry. I'd set the dials, wrestled the clothes
into the machine, and only then discovered that the detergent, in a
jumbo-sized bottle on a high shelf above the machine, was too distant,
and too heavy, for me to manage. Despair in a container of Tide.</TE>
<TE>   Even reading, my favorite activity, was difficult for many months. I
couldn't hold a book properly, and I had to resort to watching TV, all
the time, at all hours. Did you know, for instance, that "Topper" is
still on in reruns? If you stay up late enough, with nothing to do but
wait for your painkillers to kick in again, you will discover that
everything that has ever been committed to film or videotape is still on
the air, on some obscure cable station, in the dead of night. And while
we're on the subject, will someone please explain to me why anyone
watches "The O'Reilly Factor"?</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family initially sent me get-well gifts such as funny
stuffed animals and helium balloons, but after I'd explained to them that
I had not suffered any brain damage in the accident, they got the message
and stopped. "So, what would you like?" more than one of them asked, and
once I'd gotten to the point where I'd regained some control in my hands,
I asked for books. "New, used, I don't care. Just send me books."</TE>
<TE>   Some of them got it immediately and gave me just the right sort of
thing; my friend Margaret, for instance, checked out a library book for
me, a little-known novel about an embittered young English instructor
struggling to get tenure. Now that was the ticket--black humor from the
groves of academe. I could relate. My friend Carol sent me "The Girl with
the Pearl Earring," a literary novel narrated by the maid in the painter
Vermeer's household--another winner that took me out of myself and into
another world. But what, I still have to wonder, was my friend Andy
thinking when he gave me a copy, signed yet, of Warren Christopher's
memoirs? "I figured politics would take your mind off things," he said
proudly.</TE>
<TE>   And though I thanked him, I had to scratch my head (well, I would
have, if I could have) and try to remember an occasion, any occasion,
when I had expressed the slightest interest in government or public
affairs. I have long considered myself the most solipsistic, apolitical
person I know, and unless this was Andy's subtle way of at once
acknowledging and addressing as much, it was a puzzle. The fact that the
book was signed, too, meant that I couldn't ask my wife to take it back
to the store and exchange it. It sits, to this day, under the stack of
"Sopranos" tapes where I stashed it after he left.</TE>
<TE>   When I was finally able to get out a bit on my own--taking the bus to
my physical therapy sessions, for instance, and assorted medical
appointments--I started to understand what all those disability activists
were going on about. The office building where I had to go for my MRIs
had two immense glass doors that I would have had trouble opening even in
my better days. The handicapped ramps were often hard to find, and
wearyingly circuitous. The bus drivers roared away from the stops before
you'd managed to safely take your seat.</TE>
<TE>   But when it came to the people on the street, or on the bus, I've got
to say Angelenos came through with flying colors. When you drive around,
you commune with your David Sedaris tapes; when you take the bus, or
hobble around, you meet people, whether you want to or not. They hold
open doors for you, they patiently explain bus routes, they share a lot
of their own stories with you. I've got to say, some of the nicest people
I've met, with some of the most affecting tales, were folks on the bus
bench. The elderly woman with terrible arthritis who told me her dream
was to get a fridge with a bigger freezer unit so she could keep more
food in the house ("Meals on Wheels are wonderful, but they're not every
day"). Or the guy who, like me, had suffered a weird accident ("All I did
was lean back in my chair, just lean back, and then the whole thing went
over, and I fractured my tailbone in two places"). Or the woman who
retrieved my X-rays for me (they'd spilled out of the envelope as I crept
down the bus aisle) and then volunteered to get off at my stop and help
me go to my appointment ("I've got a transfer; I can always get back on
the bus at the next corner").</TE>
<TE>   It's no fun being an invalid. For someone who was reasonably healthy
and intact all his life, it's both mortifying and depressing, and though
I felt like I recognized that guy in the baseball cap and the green
Beemer driving past me, I also knew I could never be that guy again. Once
you've been forced to step outside of your own life and into another, I
don't think you're ever able to go back again. These days I know--not
just intellectually, but in my very bones--that something as simple as a
misstep over an unseen umbrella stand can change everything. I shuffle
along with my eyes on the pavement. I don't linger to look at the new
bikes in the Supergo window. I take a dozen tablets every day, from
calcium supplements to analgesics. My life has slowed down considerably
in virtually every way.</TE>
<TE>   But it hasn't stopped. In the months since my accident, I've learned
to keep the laundry detergent on top of the dryer within easy reach. I
can flip a ball to the dog underhand. I've even started, with great
trepidation and even greater relief, to drive again.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes my route takes me past that bus bench on Wilshire, where I'd
sit with my X-rays under my arm and a coin purse clutched in my hand, and
I feel as if I'm a better man now than I used to be. It's not because I
can drive again but because for a while, when I had to learn to navigate
by a whole different set of stars, I couldn't.</TE>

<HD>The Obscure History of Mickey Mouse</HD>
<DH>The Man Who First Drew Disney's Iconic Character Is Not Exactly a
Household Name. But Ub Iwerks' Granddaughter Is Out to Change That.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA TANNENBAUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a wind-swept morning, Leslie Iwerks drives her white Jeep
Cherokee down San Fernando Road on the outskirts of Burbank. She
navigates surface streets for a 10-minute trip between Iwerks
Entertainment and the Walt Disney Studios. By L.A. standards, it is a
commute barely worth mentioning. For Iwerks, the four-mile journey
symbolizes a lifetime of work. Make that two lifetimes.</LD>
<LD>   Her grandfather occupies an obscure niche in pop culture history, a
position that Iwerks has long wanted to change. The name of his
creation--Mickey Mouse--is known and beloved the world over, but the role
he played has long faded from public memory. For many decades, only
specialist film historians or impassioned students of animation recalled
his work.</LD>
<LD>   It's not the same with Walt Disney. But at one time he, too, was a
struggling, unknown producer. He relied heavily on the combined efforts
of his brother Roy and a taciturn man with whom the bonds of friendship
were formed during their apprenticeship days in 1920s Kansas City, Mo.
The taciturn man was Ub Iwerks, and it was he who designed Mickey Mouse
and drew "Plane Crazy," "The Gallopin' Gaucho" and "Steamboat Willie."
The first three Mickey Mouse cartoons were do-or-die efforts by the
nascent Disney Studios. The public responded with an outpouring of
affection for Disney and his cartoons that can only be compared with
Beatlemania. Ub got lost in the shuffle.</LD>
<TE>   "History gets lost awfully quick unless you work to keep it alive in
people's memory," says Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co.
and Walt's only nephew.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Leslie Iwerks. In 1999, she wrote, directed and produced "The
Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story," a documentary celebrating
the life and achievements of her grandfather. In May 2001, she published
a biographical companion book to the film, co-written with John
Kenworthy. Since then she has tirelessly promoted the film, attending
screenings at sites ranging from the Bay Area to the Netherlands. She
screened her documentary at last summer's Disneyana convention in
Anaheim. In October, she signed copies of her book at Walt Disney's
centennial birthday celebration on the Disney cruise ship in the
Caribbean. Last fall, the documentary finally aired on national
television, with broadcasts on the Bravo network in September and the
Independent Film Channel in November.</TE>
<TE>   And still one gets the impression that Leslie Iwerks is not quite
finished with her project.</TE>
<TE>   At the Disney Studios gate, Iwerks presents her credentials to the
security guard and is waved through. With shoulder-length blond hair,
dimpled chin and a chipped front tooth, she retains something of a
tomboy's mischievous persona beneath a demeanor of brisk efficiency. Here
to return some promotional materials, she strides across the campus-like
setting and reflects on her family's history.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Iwerks is the youngest of four children. Two brothers--Larry,
48, and John, 46--are fine-art landscape painters based in Santa Barbara.
Her sister, Tamara, 35, was a newscaster in Memphis, Tenn. Only Leslie,
32, entered the family business of filmmaking and took on the quest of
telling her grandfather's story.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather passed away in 1971, a year after I was born. I never
knew him," Iwerks says. But for as long as she could remember, she asked
members of her family to share their memories. "My brothers would say
things like, 'He wasn't that warm' or 'He didn't have a lot to say.' For
them, maybe knowing him directly was enough. But I got more inspiration
out of not knowing him, because what you don't know becomes more
interesting. The journey takes place in your imagination."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't recollect if I specifically told Leslie about Ub one way or
another," says her father, Don Iwerks. "But all the kids were aware of
what he'd done. They must have learned by osmosis that he was a pretty
talented person. I mean, the creation of Mickey, we all knew what that
was about."</TE>
<TE>   There is more to Ub Iwerks than Mickey Mouse. In 1930, he left Disney
to start his own company; after 10 years, with his own animation studio
mired in red ink, he returned to Disney in a very different role.
Immersing himself in the world of mechanical invention and special
effects, Ub became the in-house inventor, the go-to-man for any technical
problem.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, he created techniques and equipment (the traveling matte
system, the 360-degree motion-picture camera) that laid the groundwork
for the digital matte special effects we see in movies today. His
inventions made possible the special effects in "The Parent Trap," "Mary
Poppins," "The Birds" and a host of other films. But he never did
animation again.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Leslie first discovered her grandfather's story in the
memorabilia he left behind. "Ub came alive for me when I stayed over at
my grandmother's house in Sherman Oaks. The guest room where I slept was
Ub's old office. There were photos of him and Walt from the early days up
on the wall. On his desk were canisters of his old paintbrushes and
drawing pens. There were shelves with his awards and citations he'd
received over the years."</TE>
<TE>   There were early signs of Leslie Iwerks' grand obsession. In 1980, she
prepared a report on her grandfather's life for her fourth-grade class.
"Naturally the kids were excited because at that age, who doesn't like
Mickey? But what impressed me was the reaction of the adults. It was
obvious they found my story surprising."</TE>
<TE>   As a high school student, Iwerks started her own business, which hired
other students to provide graphic design for a variety of companies. In
1988, when she was a senior, she purchased a professional camera and
editing equipment and started Iwerks Video Productions. Five years later,
she graduated from USC film school. Although the next few years would see
her working as a director's assistant on several Disney and Universal
studios projects, she continued researching the life of her grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "I originally met Iwerks at USC film school," says film historian
Leonard Maltin. "She told me in 1991 that she was thinking about making
this film. I said, 'You've got to do it.' Clearly she was the right
person to take on the job. Doors would open for her that wouldn't for an
outsider."</TE>
<TE>   First, Leslie had to convince her family that a documentary was a good
idea. "We had an ongoing discussion about making this film," says Don
Iwerks. "Films are very expensive, and the family funds weren't such that
we were going to be able to offer that. But more important, if you're
going to make a film about the early days of the Disney company and show
images of Mickey Mouse, then, clearly, you have to work out some means of
collaboration with the company. If Disney didn't want to do it, that's
probably the end of the story."</TE>
<TE>   Don Iwerks wrote to Roy Disney. Would Walt Disney's nephew consider
meeting with Leslie Iwerks? "Then I left it to her to carry the ball." In
February 1994, Disney agreed to meet with Leslie for an hour. At the end
of the conversation, Disney said yes to a collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw her passion," Disney says. "That was pretty evident. And I saw
a great deal of Ub in Leslie. Like her grandfather, she had a mission.
And you've got to believe in people who believe in what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Disney's support, it took four more years before the studio
green-lighted the project in April 1998. With an initial budget of
$288,000 and set for an hour's length, studio executives expected the
project to eventually find its home on television.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 1998, Iwerks screened her 60-minute version for Disney
and other executives. "At that length, it felt sketchy," he says. "It
needed to be more emotional. And that was always the hard part. There's
very little footage of Ub laughing or smiling. But Leslie had an idea of
how to make it a fuller story."</TE>
<TE>   Disney raised the budget to $600,000 and approved the film's expansion
by 30 minutes. In October 1999, the documentary premiered at El Capitan,
Disney's flagship movie theater on Hollywood Boulevard, making it
eligible for Academy Award consideration. It did not receive a
nomination. According to gossip Leslie later heard from a committee
insider, "it did not bash Walt strongly enough."</TE>
<TE>   "That is not something I would ever want to do," says Iwerks as she
walks across the Disney back lot. She pauses at the doorway of the
animation building before entering. "I wanted to tell this story with
dignity. Ub and Walt liked each other; when they were young and courting
their wives, they socialized together."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Leslie Iwerks' documentary is the story of reconciliation and
recognition between families, the connections across generations and
their storytelling techniques both past and future. "What Leslie has
accomplished," says Maltin, "is a film that doesn't tear down Walt in
order to build up Ub. You don't have to minimize either of their
accomplishments to have a terrific story."</TE>
<TE>   It is almost time for Iwerks to return to Iwerks Entertainment, a film
production company founded in 1986 by her father. There are meetings to
attend about new movies she's working on: a documentary about the
struggle for Guatemalan citizens to keep their Mayan heritage alive. A
collaboration with her oldest brother, Larry, to produce an animated tale
about Teddy Roosevelt's dog. "All my projects seem to be about
underdogs," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean she's moved on from her grandfather's story? Iwerks
lingers in the studio's on-site retail store, noting the display of her
video on the shelves. "There's always more to do. I'd still like to get
it into video stores. I've got several screenings scheduled. Pixar wants
me to show it at their new headquarters. I'm still the caretaker, still
trying to push it along."</TE>
<TE>   A poster in the store catches her eye. It commemorates Walt Disney's
100th birthday. Last fall she visited Disney World in Florida, which had
just opened a centennial retrospective of Disney's life. It only briefly
mentions Ub Iwerks. "And I figure, that's fine. Some people are going to
continue to pass on the myth, perhaps forever. But I just have to say to
myself, 'I did what I could.' "</TE>

<DH>Artist Peter Alexander Finds Inspiration in the Landscape at Santa
Monica's Miramar Hotel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER CLOTHIER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"When you're seduced by a place and completely focused on it,
that's as good as it gets," says Peter Alexander, gesturing toward a half
dozen paintings in progress that are propped against the side of a couch
in his luxury bi-level bungalow suite at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel in
Santa Monica. Alexander is a Los Angeles-based artist who first came to
prominence as the creator of spare, elegant resin sculptures in the '60s,
one of the so-called Light and Space artists. In the '70s, he continued
to shock the generally unshockable world of cutting-edge art with his
pictures of sunsets--on velvet.</LD>
<LD>   Today it's the surface of water, specifically his sensual new images
of the swimming pool at the Miramar, that fascinates him. This past fall
he holed up for a six-week residence of intensive painting in one of the
Miramar's $700-$850 per night bungalows, hideaways since the 1920s for
the rich and glamorous. His only obligation was to look around him and
paint whatever he felt like--all at no expense to himself, except for an
agreed-upon 50% of room service costs.</LD>
<LD>   Sound like a good deal? Alexander, a reluctant sports fan,
brainstormed the idea last year after a Lakers game at Staples Center
that he attended with Santa Monica gallery dealer Craig Krull and Matt
DiNapoli, whose investment group owns the hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Alexander had recently finished a five-week stint in Laguna art dealer
Peter Blake's studio, where he was competing in the Laguna Plein Air
Painters Association's annual contest. Though he didn't win, he was
exhilarated by working at the shore without the distractions of
telephone, business, social life--even family, except on weekends. So why
not, he proposed to DiNapoli, a similar stint at the Miramar?</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Santa Monica resident, Alexander has devoted much of his
artistic energy to capturing the particular qualities of sparkling light,
the lush vegetation and the nocturnal enchantments of the coastal city,
as well as its warm, slightly decadent, somehow innocent sensuality. The
Miramar, with its rich cultural history, looked like a perfect base of
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "He was excited, we were excited," recalls DiNapoli, who was familiar
with Alexander's work from a previous hotel installation in Santa Fe. For
the hotel, DiNapoli adds, "it was a way to bring together our admiration
and support for art in Santa Monica." Once installed in his luxury digs,
Alexander went to work. He's not a plein-air painter by definition--one
who sits outdoors with an easel, and works directly from the land- or
cityscape. Instead he uses a camera to record impressions and details
from which he then works indoors. Until recently it was a 35-millimeter
camera or a Polaroid.</TE>
<TE>   For the Miramar project he used a Sony digital video camera. "With the
video camera I compose less and shoot more for information," he explains.
That is to say, isolating images shot with a video camera allows the
artist to capture details he might have otherwised overlooked. "With
stop-frame images you see all this stuff that you didn't see before,
because of your built-in sense of framing."</TE>
<TE>   From these images the artist composes his drawings and
paintings--pastels and acrylics on black paper and acrylics on
gesso-treated panels. Heaps of these images are laid out on table- and
counter-tops to dry or are pinned on walls--a maelstrom of work and
energy. In addition to the pool paintings, there are nighttime views of
the pier and the fun fair, and renderings of palm trees and flora in the
hotel gardens, glowing with sunlight or the gleam of artificial
illumination after dark.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was sunlight on water that seemed to fascinate him most,
perhaps because it presented him with an entirely new challenge. Shooting
down into the pool from the eighth floor with his video camera, he
captured the slightly unreal blue of the pool--not only the constantly
shifting, glittering surface of the water, but also its depth.</TE>
<TE>   To re-create the image in acrylic paint, he had been working on wood
panels made white and smooth with gesso, applying color with sponges
loaded with water. "The method worked. I was astounded. You really do
want to fall into that water," says the artist. The loose, translucent
surfaces of the resulting pictures shimmer with the inviting aqua glow of
a swimming pool. To many of these scenes he has temporarily attached a
green painted image of a palm frond to help anchor the otherwise
disoriented eye. "I keep wanting not to have the leaves," the artist
continues, peeling one off and trying it in another place, standing back
to judge the effect. " 'I want to let the water tell the story. But they
do give you that tweak of reality."</TE>
<TE>   A part of the deal with the hotel included a onetime show in the hotel
with a reception today that is open to the public. Following their
exhibition at the Miramar, the pictures await installation at the Craig
Krull Gallery, where they will be on display from May 24 through June 29,
with a gallery reception from 4 to 6 p.m. on June 1. The exhibition
should make for an exhilarating glimpse at an artist's special take on
the world around him.</TE>

<HD>A Trio of Vermont Cheddars Forms the Ultimate in Comfort Food</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM TSCHORN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no escaping those bitingly sharp cheddars during my
Vermont childhood. Cubed and tossed into plastic baggies for an apres-ski
snack, sliced thin onto crackers with venison sausage as an appetizer,
and slabbed thick onto apple pie for dessert, the stuff was everywhere.
As a kid I would watch my dad wrestle 40-pound wheels of cheddar off a
dairy truck. In the back of his gas station I would steady each wheel of
pale yellow heaven for him while he carved it into five-pound wedges to
resell from a beat-up refrigerator. For my efforts I'd be rewarded with a
cast-off piece of cheese so sharp that the glands behind my lower jaw
would tingle.</LD>
<LD>   My family's cheese consumption spiked in the '80s when my mom and dad
bought the then 130-year-old Wayside Country Store. Frugal people, they
couldn't bear to see perfectly good food go to waste and, because the
store's popular extra-sharp cheddars were hacked, sliced and chunked from
iceberg-size blocks sitting under a plastic cake dome in the deli, there
always seemed to be odd cheddar ends that needed to be used.</LD>
<LD>   One day, a store employee gathered the cast-off cheese tailings and
used them to whip up a batch of macaroni and cheese. The result was a
tangy and complex version of a usually bland comfort food. Over the last
decade, it has become a staple for the store's lunch crowd and a perfect
showcase for Vermont's extra-sharp cheddars.</LD>
<TE>   While you can't get the full effect unless you swing by the Wayside
for lunch (if you do, make sure to tell Doug and Nancy their kid's
staying out of trouble in L.A.), you can come pretty close right here in
Southern California if you're willing to hunt around for just the right
cheese.</TE>
<TE>   The store's holy trinity of extra-sharps came from the Cabot Creamery,
Crowley Cheese and the Seward Family (which has since gone out of
business). You can find Cabot's extra sharp at most Trader Joe's
locations. Whole Foods Markets carries the Crowley cheeses. An
extra-sharp from the Grafton Village Cheese Company serves as a worthy
replacement for the now extinct Seward cheese. It can also be found at
Whole Foods.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Princiotta, the cheese buyer at The Cheese Store of Beverly
Hills, also suggests a few non-Vermont extra-sharps that will do in a
pinch. They include Tuxford &amp; Tebbutt cheddar from England, Old Quebec
cheddar from Canada, Vintage Irish cheddar from Ireland (all available at
The Cheese Store of Beverly Hills) and a Bravo Farms Special Reserve from
Visalia, Calif. (available at Bristol Farms).</TE>
<TE>   It may take a little legwork to procure the right blend of extra-sharp
cheddars for this recipe but it sure beats wrestling a 40-pound wheel off
a dairy truck.</TE>
<TE>The Wayside Country Store's  Mac and Cheese</TE>
<TE>   Serves 8 to 10</TE>
<TE>   4 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   4 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   2 cups whole milk</TE>
<TE>   2 cups of shredded Vermont extra-sharp cheese (preferably 1/3 cup each
of three different cheeses) with extra to sprinkle on top if baking</TE>
<TE>   Salt and pepper to taste</TE>
<TE>   2 cups (16 ounces) of elbow macaroni</TE>
<TE>   Cook the macaroni in 2 quarts boiling water. Melt the butter in a
saucepan. After the butter is completely melted, turn off the heat and
whisk in the flour. Heat the milk and whisk it into the butter/flour
mixture. Turn the heat back on to medium and continue to stir until the
mixture just begins to thicken. Add the cheese and continue stirring
until all the cheese is melted. Add salt and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Add the sauce to the cooked and strained macaroni. For a creamier
version, serve immediately. For a more traditional version, bake in an
oven-proof casserole with additional grated cheddar on top for 20 minutes
at 350 degrees.</TE>

<HD>How to Clean Up El Toro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cleaning up contaminants at the closed El Toro Marine air base always
has been a major challenge facing any reuse plan. Now that a park
appears to be the final proposal, it is essential that the U.S. Navy
use proceeds from the sale of land at El Toro to pay for cleanup
costs.</LD>
<LD>   Navy brass clearly don't want to open their checkbook for El Toro,
one of several former bases in California with the dubious
distinction of having been designated as Superfund hazardous waste
cleanup sites. The Navy argues that about $300 million previously set
aside will cover environmental remediation costs. Truth be told, no
one yet knows how extensive and expensive the job will be.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government is obligated to clean up the potential
witches' brew of hazardous and toxic materials generated during more
than 50 years of Marine aviation activity. The Great Park now
envisioned as a result of a March ballot initiative will rise on
ground that has held drainage ditches, sewer systems, underground
storage tanks and landfills. Base workers used trichloroethylene to
degrease engines, and older electrical transformers were filled with
polychlorinated biphenyls. Fuel spills and contamination from battery
acids were an inevitable fact of life for decades along the flight
line.</LD>
<TE>   The federal government has spent more than $1.6 billion to clean
up hazardous and toxic waste at the state's former military bases.
That sounds like a lot of money, but 12 former bases in California
alone are on the Superfund list. The Navy will glean a small fortune
from land sales. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) was right to demand
that the money be used to ensure that land being transferred for
parkland and related uses is safe.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro's environmental legacy is underscored by the base's
inclusion on the list of dangerous Superfund sites. Washington's
historical reticence to fund its obligations, however, is a real
concern. The prospect of the hard-fought El Toro redevelopment plan
being stalled at a critical juncture because Uncle Sam won't provide
the funding is disturbing. Feinstein has identified a reliable source
of funding--the proceeds of potentially lucrative land sales at the
base--that will keep the costly cleanup on track.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's proposal, made last month in a letter to Secretary of
the Navy Gordon R. England, won't sit well with the Defense
Department. The Armed Forces understandably want to use funds
generated by land sales to bridge military funding shortfalls.
Feinstein doesn't have the authority to tell the Navy what to do, but
she sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which can apply
significant pressure on the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Turning El Toro into a Great Park means the Navy has an even
greater environmental responsibility. When El Toro was being reviewed
for a possible commercial airport, the Navy identified 929 more
potential environmental hot spots. That review assumed that some
environmental problems would remain buried under runways. The level
of environmental remediation will increase, however, because parks
put people in direct contact with the land.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy says it is committed to cleaning up El Toro. Pledging
proceeds of potentially lucrative land sales at the former base would
signal that the Navy is taking its promise seriously.</TE>

<HD>Save Immigrants From Cons</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's bad enough when a con artist takes your money and runs. It's
even more painful when the criminal also trashes your dreams. More
than 100 Latino families recently saw their hopes dashed by a
mother-daughter team in Stanton who last month pleaded guilty to
posing as immigration agents and taking $105,000 from their victims
in exchange for bogus promises to assist in obtaining residency
cards.</LD>
<LD>   Immigration fraud is rampant in Southern California because most
victims, typically undocumented workers, are afraid to complain to
police because of fears they'll be deported. It's a vicious situation
because those who stoop low enough to defraud undocumented workers
also will use that fear to blackmail victims bold enough to demand
their money back.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County should be doing more to protect undocumented
workers. A good starting point would be the creation of a specialized
prosecution team akin to the Los Angeles Immigration Fraud Task
Force. The Los Angeles County district attorney's task force works
with community groups to educate undocumented residents about the
dangers of immigration fraud and their legal rights.</LD>
<TE>   The task force acts as a clearinghouse for immigration fraud data,
and it educates police agencies that often operate under the mistaken
belief that immigration fraud isn't a criminal matter. The task force
is working with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to suggest regulatory changes that would
allow undocumented workers to register complaints without the fear of
initiating deportation proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County should protect those who can least afford to be
taken for a painful and expensive ride. The reason is evident in the
plaintive message from a 34-year-old mother of three who lost $3,000
in the Stanton scam: "We just wanted hope, and sometimes you pay
anything for hope."</TE>

<HD>Tollways Should Act as One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Joaquin Hills toll road always has been the troubled relative
among Orange County's quasi-public toll roads. Now the family is
about to take remedial action, and while there may be some risks,
there really is no good alternative.</LD>
<LD>   From the beginning, the San Joaquin was a dubious proposition,
stirring fierce opposition in Laguna Beach before it cut a swath
through pristine coastal hills. While serving a new suburban area
like Aliso Viejo and providing an alternate route north for an older
one like Laguna Niguel, it never had enough high-growth areas along
its route to provide sufficient paying customers. And the price in
perceived environmental damage was high even after the initial
outcry. When a national convention of environmental writers visited
Laguna Canyon a few years ago, panelists gave them a grim assessment
of the damage to the land and community psyche caused by the road's
construction.</LD>
<LD>   Recently the toll road's directors authorized a merger with the
more successful agency that oversees the other two Orange County
tollways, the Eastern and Foothill corridors. The merger vote is
scheduled next month, and there appears to be a sound basis for
allowing this merger to go forward.</LD>
<TE>   The Foothill tollway has been so successful that it recently
announced a $12.8-million project to add a new northbound lane to
clear bottlenecks. Northbound ridership is said to be about 4,600
cars in peak hours, and the area between Bake and Santa Margarita
parkways is especially crowded.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are serious questions about plans to extend the
Foothill corridor south through sensitive environmental lands near
San Onofre, the justification for northern parts of the roads was
much easier to see. Without the Foothill, Coto de Caza, Portola
Hills, Lake Forest and parts of Mission Viejo would have been less
viable as residential communities serving employment centers to the
north. The road was a necessity, not merely an alternative to other
northbound routes, the way the San Joaquin Hills corridor was. The
San Joaquin route didn't give northbound commuters along the coast a
compelling alternative once improvements at the El Toro Y on the San
Diego Freeway eased that bottleneck. The Foothill, by contrast, was a
logical artery to serve new communities in a growing part of the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Without the merger of a successful arm of the toll roads with the
unsuccessful one, the San Joaquin would face a troubled future going
it alone. Several months ago, a major Wall Street rating agency
downgraded more than $1 billion in San Joaquin road bonds to junk
status. A merger makes possible a restructuring of debt, and the
flexibility to streamlined operations.</TE>
<TE>   Officials long have been searching for a way to price the San
Joaquin out of its ridership problems. The agency refinanced its debt
in 1997, realizing a savings from a reduction in interest rates, a
good move. But the traffic is still not enough to generate sufficient
revenue. Simply raising the price of trips, as happened recently,
creates its own problems. A steady stream of increases risks
alienating the road's regular customers and makes it harder to
attract new ones.</TE>
<TE>   The warnings of those who worry that a merger would drag down the
other roads should be heeded. But these roads were conceived as a
unit, and together, they are designed to serve all of Orange County.
The solution requires a strategy to help the poor relative through
tough times.</TE>

<LD>Re "Thinking Outside Big-Box Zoning," April 29</LD>
<LD>   Your article about the regional implications of city governments
that use zoning powers to improve sales tax income touched the edges
of the fiscal dilemma faced by California communities but did not
address the underlying causes.</LD>
<LD>   All cities must have a general plan that balances residential,
retail, manufacturing, office, recreation, schools and public uses.
The plan reflects geographic and economic factors and community
input. The point is, development is done with considerable
forethought.</LD>
<TE>   The perceived bias toward retail is driven by unintended
consequences of Proposition 13 that allow the state Legislature to
divert local property taxes from cities. During its early 1990s
budget crisis, the state initiated a diversion of local revenues that
now costs residents more than $4.9 billion per year. As we anticipate
a $20-billion state budget deficit for the coming year, cities are
again forced to prepare to fight against even more diversions.</TE>
<TE>   The state feels safe in diverting local dollars to subsidize state
responsibilities. This sense of insulation also allows the state to
adopt laws that pass costs on to cities for which there is no
identified revenue source. These unfunded mandates are as damaging to
local governments as the more overt diversions.</TE>
<TE>   The current legislative proposal calling for sales-tax sharing
ignores costs associated with retail uses. The fundamental issue is
that cities need constitutional protection of their revenue sources
or our quality of life will be threatened by poorly maintained
streets and roads, lack of parks and recreational opportunities and
cuts to public safety services.</TE>
<TE>   Local control works if cities are not starved for resources. Any
conversation regarding the viability of city services must begin with
a commitment to keep local dollars within the local communities.</TE>
<TE>   Anything else is a Band-Aid.</TE>

<LD>Re "Opening Up the 91 Freeway," editorial, April 28</LD>
<LD>   As immediate past president of the Orange County Chapter of the
Building Industry Assn., I applaud the Orange County Transportation
Authority's decision to buy out the 91 Toll Lanes' "non-compete"
agreement. OCTA has made an impressive first step that will end
lawsuits and earmark dollars for improvements in both counties.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County is job-rich and housing-poor, which is why the 91
Freeway is in gridlock. More homes in Orange County, more jobs in
Riverside County, and better transportation alternatives linking the
counties are essential given regional growth projections.</LD>

<LD>Re "Grand Jury Is Praised for Sewage-Study Action," letters, May 5</LD>
<LD>   The Times is to be commended for its strong opposition to the
renewal of Orange County Sanitation District's 301 (h) sewage
treatment waiver.</LD>
<LD>   The excellent letter by Jan Vandersloot highlights the devastating
result of the unconscionable actions (and inactions) of the OCSD,
which has neglected its duty to protect the environment.</LD>
<TE>   The public can no longer afford to excuse environmental pollution
for the sake of short-term financial benefit. Full secondary
treatment, although not accomplishing complete disinfection of
sewage, is a step toward the restoration of the offshore marine
environment and safe, clean beaches for the citizens of Southern
California. Amigos de Bolsa Chica strongly opposes the renewal of the
301(h) treatment waiver.</TE>

<TE>   I'm distressed that the Orange County Sanitation district is still
holding onto the 301(h) waiver. More and more people have been
attending OCSD board meetings since learning about this mess.
Recently, the public comments have been taking up so much time that
General Manager Blake Anderson wants to allow only 30 minutes of
comment before the meeting begins, and then make everyone else wait
and speak at the end of the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   If public opinion in this waiver issue is a factor, Anderson
should have a higher regard for public input. If 25 or 50 or 100
people are showing up to these meetings and demanding that the waiver
not be renewed, then maybe it's time to get rid of the waiver, not
the public comments!</TE>

<TE>   Re "Beach Closure Is Reminder of 1999 Problems," May 2</TE>
<TE>   As a founding member of the Orange County Ocean Outfall Group, a
citizens advisory committee, I have studied the issue enough to know
that it's time to wake up and smell the sewage. In your recent
article, a spokeswoman for the county's environmental health division
makes silly statements like, "We still don't understand what's going
on," and "It's like an onion, we're gradually peeling the layers
away." It's like an onion all right; it stinks to high heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County operates under a 301(h) waiver that allows it to
dump dirtier sewage than 99.75% of the country's sewage districts.
The grand jury has told us that had a publicly funded 1997 study been
made public, the sewage district probably wouldn't have won its
waiver. With ongoing public protests outside the sewage plant in
Fountain Valley and a well-choreographed "city-by-city" campaign by
the environmental community, all we can say is: Do us a favor, get
RID of the waiver.</TE>

<LD>Re "When the Growing Gets Tough," commentary, April 28</LD>
<LD>   Orange County residents haven't uniformly rejected public
transportation, including buses and rail. Nobody likes paying tolls,
but the toll roads were built because the state claimed it didn't
have the funds to build them as freeways. The consolidation of the
two Transportation Corridor Agencies boards is a sensible way to cut
red tape and make the toll road system financially viable. We need a
healthy toll-road system as a part of our ground transportation
solution.</LD>

<LD>   In all the propaganda generated by the Cottonwood Christian Church
case against Cypress, the real issue often is overlooked. Our
government has given itself the power to take land from citizens who
have legally purchased it.</LD>
<LD>   The city's actions should scare every American citizen. City
officials are acting like a street gang that extorts money from
businesses in their "hood." Businesses that won't pay are forced out
and businesses that will are allowed to move in.</LD>
<TE>   Has Costco approached Cottonwood and made them an offer they can't
refuse? No, and why should they, when Cypress and other cities are
out there stealing the land for them. How can Costco go wrong if the

<LD>Re "Huntington Beach Hasn't Got a Prayer Without Her," May 3</LD>
<LD>   The Huntington Beach mayor who cites upholding the Constitution as
a pretext for excluding an invocation before starting City Council
meetings is at best displaying a callous indifference to a tradition
of opening legislative meetings with a prayer, not to mention the 1st
Amendment.</LD>
<LD>   A 1983 Supreme Court decision referred to in the article noted
that the Supreme Court and Congress traditionally have begun their
sessions with prayers and that individual states do not have to abide
by more stringent 1st Amendment limits than the federal government.
Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote that, "in light of the unambiguous
and unbroken history of more than 200 years, there can be no doubt
that the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer has
become part of the fabric of our society. To invoke divine guidance
on a public body entrusted with making the laws is not an
'establishment' of religion or a step toward establishment; it is
simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the
people of this country."</LD>

<LD>Re "Lack of Permits Halts Grading at Juvenile Camp," April 30</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for your article. It is hard to believe that an
organization responsible for overseeing justice can so easily break
the law. The Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy, a youth detention
center run by the Orange County Probation Department, seems to have
little regard for the law.</LD>
<LD>   This really is no surprise in a county known for fiscal
irresponsibility. This project is a financial and environmental
disaster. The only way taxpayers and the environment will be saved is
if they build the jail and throw our Orange County Board of
Supervisors in it. At $200,000 a bed, they will be comfortable and
the rest of us will feel safe.</LD>

<TE>   I see it as foolish to spend money to improve the boys' ranch in
Trabuco Canyon when there is a more convenient and cost-effective
alternative--relocating the ranch to the El Toro Marine base. Why
impact the canyon when you have an area that has the infrastructure
as well as public transportation to serve relatives of some of those
who will be incarcerated there? Our government should seek ways to
increase the buffer between the national forest and development. One
way to do that is to use the base to house needed facilities instead
of putting them in areas that would be better left untouched or
converted into parks.</TE>

<TE>   I'm writing about the virgin habitat that has been destroyed by
crews operating without proper permits. I do not like to be
stereotyped as a tree hugger or environmental activist. The Live Oak
Canyon road on the way to Trabuco Canyon has oak trees overhanging
the road. When you enter the area, you lose track of time and place.
At that moment you could be anywhere in the world.</TE>
<TE>   If you allow this outrage to continue, it will be only the
beginning of the destruction of the entire area, reaching from
Santiago Canyon to Rancho Santa Margarita. I'm concerned that the
birds and trees can't live the way they were meant to live. We're
wrong if we think that we can pave over all of Orange County and
still have the mental health that we are barely holding on to by a
string.</TE>

a parking lot for the Joplin Youth Center. I do not understand why
they have the right to kill live oaks.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hand-Burning Fine Is Just, Say Public Defenders," May 6:</LD>
<LD>   I can understand much of the outrage over Judge James O. Perez's
decision in the child abuse case against Wellington Soto. Before we
condemn Perez's decision, we should remember that the underlying
purpose of having judges involved in sentencing is to allow
discretion in the administration of punishment. The judge is in the
best position to weigh the facts and law as presented by both sides.
Although a different culture is not a perfect excuse, it is relevant
toward revealing the intent of the defendant and his likelihood to
commit future crimes. If we allow any mitigating evidence, surely
cultural background should be an important ingredient in sentencing.</LD>

<LD>Re "When the Growing Gets Tough," Commentary, April 28:</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Transportation Authority Vice Chairman Tim Kennon
correctly describes how the OCTA has made more than $6.55 billion in
improvements to Orange County's road system. The real reason behind
the success was getting the public to support extending the half-cent
sales tax (Measure M) beyond its 2011 sunset provision. Without the
tax, OCTA will not be able to subsidize the proposed $1.5-billion
Irvine-to-Santa Ana light-rail system.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA has spent more than $15 million over the years to study rail
transit for Orange County. All of the studies clearly detail the
reasons why rail will never have any effect on automobile traffic
congestion. It appears Kennon has ignored the facts in favor of his
personal and long-standing support of trains.</LD>

<HD>Columnist Is Right: Kline Should Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Why Kline Should Resign," Commentary, May 5:</LD>
<LD>   Stuart P. Jasper's opinion piece suggested that Orange County
Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline should resign. Jasper is right,
but the Orange County Bar Assn. missed an opportunity to inform and
serve the public before the March primary election.</LD>
<LD>   As Jasper explained, the bar association's Judiciary Committee
evaluates judicial applicants whom the governor sends for rating. The
Judiciary Committee also evaluates candidates in contested races.
Before the March election, the committee evaluated candidates in
every race but one--the race for Kline's seat. By not rating Kline or
any of the write-in challengers vying for his post, the committee
failed to serve the public.</LD>
<TE>   Even in a race that becomes relatively notorious, the public
relies on the local bar association for information on candidates.
Jasper so much as concedes this when he comments that "the write-in
process ... was clumsy.... Voters didn't get adequate information."
Of course they didn't, because the bar association didn't do its job.</TE>
<TE>   Judges are required to adhere to the California Code of Judicial
Ethics. Canon 2 of that code states that "a judge shall respect and
comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the
judiciary." The commentary to this canon states that "public
confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper
conduct by judges. The prohibition against behaving with impropriety
or the appearance of impropriety applies to both the professional and
personal conduct of a judge."</TE>
<TE>   As Jasper noted, "being indicted for pedophilia-related charges
has destroyed public trust in Kline's ability to be fair and
impartial." At a minimum, Kline's situation imposed on the committee
a duty to survey bar association members with regard to his
reputation for integrity and qualifications--as was done for other
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is not Kline's innocence or guilt, but his fitness to be
reelected to his judicial office, an entirely different and far more
exacting standard. By blurring the two, the committee failed to serve
the public. Judiciary committee members always have been diligent in
evaluating potential appointments and candidates for the judiciary.
They would have served Orange County even more diligently by ensuring
that the public was well informed before the March primary ballot.</TE>

<TE>   Stuart Jasper is right on the mark in calling for Judge Kline's
resignation--something I have been seeking for almost six months. But
his trashing of all write-in candidates (including a former Superior
Court judge) is off base, and his attack on our democratic system of
electing judges is indefensible. It's his broadside against the
intelligence of Orange County voters, however, that's alarming. No
doubt Jasper would rather select the next president by committee
instead of the clumsy--as he calls it--election process our
forefathers rightly envisioned and our military protects.</TE>
<TE>   Kline would have been elected automatically--his name not even
appearing on the March ballot--except that several write-in
candidates collected enough signatures to force Kline onto the
ballot. More than 250,000 Orange County voters took the time and
trouble to write the name of a qualified candidate on their ballot.
The fact that Kline was rejected by a 2-1 margin is a tribute to
those interested voters.</TE>
<TE>   Jasper's notion that "voters didn't get adequate information"
about the write-in candidates amazes me. Can you think of a race in
recent memory that drew more media attention? Crisscrossing Orange
County, the write-in candidates collectively addressed tens of
thousands of voters at dozens of meetings. Most voters knew about
Kline. Instead, they wanted to learn more about the write-in
candidates, our temperament for the bench and our qualifications for
office. I know because I was there.</TE>
<TE>   Write-in candidates presented their credentials and experience to
voters through television and radio talk shows, newspaper reports,
mailers and good old-fashioned rallies. The people listened and
responded. More than 130,000 wrote in my name, giving me the
privilege of appearing on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Write-in campaigns are tough to win. But they serve as a
time-honored safety valve when voters are faced with an unacceptable
choice. Far from being awkward--as Jasper claims--a successful
write-in campaign is a swift way to block the election of an
unacceptable candidate--exactly what happened to Kline. Contrary to
Jasper's view, previous write-in candidates have served us well. Many
will remember 20 years ago when former U.S. Rep. Ron Packard was
elected through the write-in process.</TE>
<TE>   It troubles me that Jasper, a member of my own profession, would
suggest people qualified to sit on a jury in judgment of others are
too dumb to weigh the qualifications of judicial candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Most lawyers do not share Jasper's dim view of voter intelligence.
Four other hotly contested judicial races were held in the March
primary and two incredibly skilled and dedicated lawyers, Lance
Jensen and Kimberly Menninger, were elected to Superior Court seats.
Why on earth would anyone think the appointment process would have
done a better job than the voters in electing them?</TE>
<TE>   Since we have never met, I have no idea why Jasper thinks the
governor would select a better judicial candidate than the voters did
in March. I entered the primary, won the write-in race against Kline
and will be on the November ballot. The notion that voters should not
participate in selecting judicial candidates, especially in this
situation, is both wrong and dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, it's curious why Jasper is so keen on evaluating
judicial candidates by various committees for appointment by the
governor. You see, Kline was appointed.</TE>

<HD>Navy Should Sell El Toro at Fair-Market Value</HD>

<LD>Re "'For Sale': A Base's Future," Editorial, May 5:</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial said the U.S. Navy plans to sell the base property
to recoup costs associated with moving troops and equipment to other
locations. According to my recollection, the Navy was going to give
El Toro to Orange County for use as an airport. Then, when the
airport proposal started to fade, we started reading the Navy was
going to sell El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, the military is being given a nearly blank check to
spend money because of 9/11. It's absurd to think there is really a
Navy department in Washington making base property decisions
according to civilian-type cost-benefit analyses.</LD>
<TE>   If the Navy wanted to maximize revenue from selling the base, it
would list it for sale with a fair-market price. We all know what's
likely to happen in an auction. Either the price won't reflect the
value, or it will be compromised because of the cleanup needed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "El Toro Airport Advocates Lost to a United Suburbia," April 28:</LD>
<LD>   The article fails to accurately describe what occurred during the
planning for a commercial airport at El Toro. From the beginning,
county supervisors hijacked the planning process and used highly paid
"experts" to minimize and hide adverse environmental impacts.</LD>
<LD>   The driving force behind El Toro was always Newport Beach's
big-money interests, who, fed up with aircraft noise from John Wayne
Airport, wanted to move commercial jet service to El Toro. Cramming a
giant airport down the throats of south Orange County residents was
the end game.</LD>
<TE>   South County residents were fighting a corrupt planning process
that was intent on concealing noise, pollution and traffic impact
from an El Toro airport. The more people became informed about the
proposed airport, the more they realized what was taking place.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Thorton</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You write that "hundreds of thousands of residents across Orange
County who battled a commercial airport at El Toro celebrated a
common victory this past week: the triumph of suburbia." I can assure
you, as one of many who battled the El Toro airport, what was
celebrated was the triumph of hard-working men and women fighting to
protect their quality of life against super-rich, Newport Beach-based
special interests and, in particular, resident billionaire George
Argyros.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro had nothing to do with economic necessity. El Toro was
nothing more than a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Newport Beach
to shut down John Wayne Airport. As knowledge of this spread
throughout Orange County, so did opposition to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Another glaring omission of the article were the repercussions
from the county's failed 1999 flight demonstration. What was intended
to be a "snapshot" of the nonintrusive nature of an El Toro airport
instead became the most galvanizing event in the history of airport
opposition.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the people of Los Angeles hate us. I have been living in
Orange County my entire life and I am getting fed up with the selfish
views of the majority of people living in this county. Do Orange
County residents ever put themselves in other people's shoes? Do we
think the citizens living around Los Angeles International Airport
want their homes destroyed to accommodate Orange County's soaring
population?</TE>
<TE>   If Orange County wants to continue building thousands of new
homes, I think we should pick up the slack for our travel and air
cargo. Orange County will never be a major force in the business
world as long as it doesn't have an international airport.</TE>

<HD>Joseph Bonanno, 97; Infamous Mobster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph Bonanno, the notorious gangster known as "Joe Bananas" who ran
one of the nation's most powerful Mafia groups in the 1950s and '60s,
died Saturday in Tucson. He was 97.</LD>
<LD>   Bonanno, who retired to Arizona in 1968 and had suffered from
several health problems in recent years, died of heart failure, said
his attorney, Alfred "Skip" Donau. He died peacefully, surrounded by
his family, Donau said.</LD>
<LD>   At the height of his power, Bonanno directed one of the five
original crime families in New York City. The public knew him as "Joe
Bananas"--a nickname he detested.</LD>
<TE>   By his own admission, he was a member of "the Commission," which
acted as an organized-crime board of directors in New York and other
major U.S. cities. He denied engaging in such "unmanly" activities as
narcotics trafficking or prostitution, though authorities said
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Bonanno called himself "a man of honor."</TE>
<TE>   "I say before, and I say again: All my life I've been
misunderstood," he told Mike Wallace during a 1983 "60 Minutes"
interview. "I just run my family as a father."</TE>
<TE>   "I was born a man of honor," he said. "I was the most respected
man in New York and all over the country."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Bonanno was born Jan. 18, 1905, in Castellammare del Golfo,
Sicily, the son of a prosperous farmer whose family commanded both
fear and respect.</TE>
<TE>   His parents brought him to the United States when he was a year
old but returned five years later to Castellammare, where Joseph
began living the life of a well-to-do Sicilian youth.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling this time in later years, Bonanno told how he and a band
of youthful companions used terror to enforce the code of silence
upon younger and weaker schoolmates, and how his father conspired to
destroy a virtuous woman's reputation in order to beat a murder
charge.</TE>
<TE>   His father died when he was 10, his mother five years later. At
19, Bonanno returned to the United States illegally through Cuba and
joined the Brooklyn Mafia gang commanded by Salvatore Maranzano, an
old friend of his father's.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of the Maranzano gang caused concern for Joe
Masseria, who was then considered the leader of all Mafia
organizations in New York. Most of the gang's members hailed from
Castellammare.</TE>
<TE>   Young Bonanno quickly built a reputation, increasing Maranzano's
illicit liquor business, expanding the Italian lottery operation to
all of Brooklyn and investing the extra money in many legitimate
businesses. Masseria decided to wipe out the Castellammarese faction
as a possible rival.</TE>
<TE>   The "Castellammarese War" of 1931 began with several street
murders and seemed for a time to be a simple takeover by the Masseria
group. But as the months passed, the tide of battle began to shift.</TE>
<TE>   Aided by Bonanno's strategic and tactical abilities, the Brooklyn
group soon gained a considerable advantage in numbers and firepower.
Masseria lieutenants Lucky Luciano and Vito Genovese, realigning
their loyalties, arranged Masseria's murder in return for an
open-arms welcome from the Maranzano organization.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, Bonanno conspired to take the place of his
employer and benefactor, Maranzano, by having the older man shot and
stabbed to death.</TE>
<TE>   His reward was immediate.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, five Mafia "families" were established, headed
by Luciano, Vincent Mangano, Gaetano Gagliano, Joseph Profaci, and
the youngest don of the national syndicate, 26-year-old Bonanno.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 1931, just two months after he set up the murder of
his father's old friend, Bonanno married Fay Labruzzo--and began a
period of tranquillity and prosperity that would last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   His cash reserves enabled him to make a number of profitable real
estate investments during the Depression and, unlike many other
mobsters, he largely avoided serious trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Al Capone went to prison for income tax evasion. Genovese fled the
country to avoid a murder charge. Luciano was imprisoned for pimping,
and other Mafia chieftains were busily shooting each other in
territorial disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Bonanno was arrested numerous times, including once in the 1930s
when he was accused of transporting guns for Capone. But his sole
conviction during that era came in 1945 for violating wage laws. He
was fined $450.</TE>
<TE>   Bonanno fell from grace during the 1960s, reputedly for trying to
become the boss of bosses in what came to be known as "the Banana
War." The battle among the crime families resulted in his eventual
exile to Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   His crime family still bears his name, though he maintained in his
1983 autobiography, "A Man of Honor, the Autobiography of Joseph
Bonanno," that "I'm not a Father anymore and there is no Bonanno
Family anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Even in his waning years, Bonanno was unable to avoid the
attention of prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, they succeeded in getting the only felony conviction
against him, for obstruction of justice for trying to block a federal
grand jury investigating his sons.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence that led to the conviction was obtained by a narcotics
strike force that sifted through his trash for years.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge eventually reduced his five-year sentence to a
year, and Bonanno served nearly eight months in a Lexington, Ky.,
federal prison before being paroled in July 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985 and '86, he served 14 months in prison for contempt of
court. He had refused to answer prosecutors' questions before a
planned trial of reputed leaders of New York's organized crime
families.</TE>
<TE>   The judge and prosecutors--including then-U.S. Atty. Rudolph
Giuliani--had traveled to Tucson to take his testimony, but Bonanno
claimed ill health in refusing to testify.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, he sued his publisher for $18 million over what he said
was a depiction of a "cheap gangster" on the cover of the paperback
version. He described himself in the book as a "venture capitalist"
who invested in businesses with owners that invited him to become a
partner because of his connections.</TE>
<TE>   But a 1983 New York City police report to the Senate Judiciary
Committee said the Bonanno organization historically "has been deeply
rooted in the importation of narcotics" into the United States and
was also heavily involved in pornography.</TE>
<TE>   The "Banana War" ran roughly from 1964 to 1969, and started after
Bonanno reportedly plotted to assassinate several other family
bosses, including Carlo Gambino and Thomas Lucchese.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1964, Bonanno disappeared, allegedly kidnapped by a
cousin and rival just as he was supposed to testify before a grand
jury in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Bonanno said he was released after being held in a farmhouse for
six weeks. He later fled to his second home in Tucson and stayed out
of sight for 19 months before surrendering to a federal judge in New
York. Authorities suggested his kidnapping was staged to prevent him
from having to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bonanno's crime family descended into civil war between
a group loyal to Bonanno and his son Salvatore and another composed
of dissidents supported by the other commission bosses.</TE>
<TE>   At least 13 people died, including three Bonanno opponents killed
in a gunfight at a Queens restaurant. The dispute dragged on for five
years with no clear winner. Bonanno's two sons, Salvatore and Joseph
Jr., also have been involved in scrapes with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Jr. was given a 120-day jail sentence in June 1985 after
pleading guilty to making a false statement to a federal drug agent
during an alleged cocaine conspiracy investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Both sons also were charged in an alleged home-improvement scam.
Salvatore was convicted and Joe Jr. pleaded no contest in a plea
bargain.</TE>

<LD>Two men died in separate shootings in the San Fernando Valley, police
said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   A man was killed while leaving a party in the 11100 block of De
Haven Avenue in Pacoima about 1 a.m. Saturday, Los Angeles police
detectives said. The attacker was among a large group of people
milling in the street and fled the scene, police said. Authorities
had not identified the victim by late Saturday. They had no suspects
and were investigating the shooting as possibly gang-related.</LD>
<LD>   Late Friday night or early Saturday, two rival gang members opened
fire on each other in the 13200 block of Vanowen Street in North
Hollywood, leaving one man dead, said Sgt. Tom Toutant. The other man
was listed in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center, he
said. The identities of the men were not available.</LD>

<HD>Swelling Budget Gap Leaves Davis With Few Options</HD>
<DH>Finance: A projected $20-billion deficit may lead to tax
hikes, service cuts, more borrowing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO--The plan in January, when Gov. Gray Davis faced what
seemed to be a daunting $12-billion budget shortfall, was to stall
and hope for the best. His spending proposal relied on borrowing,
federal help and optimistic assumptions, and critics derided it as
smoke and mirrors.</LD>
<LD>   Four months later, with a new "real" budget plan due from the
governor, the economic news has gotten worse, not better.</LD>
<LD>   As Davis prepares release of his highly anticipated "May revise"
budget Tuesday, the projected hole has grown to at least $20 billion
and the options aren't pretty.</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers expect the governor to propose deeper budget cuts than
the $5.2 billion in trims he floated in January, to borrow even more
money and--even though it's considered politically risky in an
election year--to consider a tax increase. State Sen. Steve Peace,
the El Cajon Democrat who chairs the Senate Budget Committee,
described the situation as "the toughest budget circumstance that any
governor has had to face in [a] century."</TE>
<TE>   The most likely candidate for a tax or fee increase is thought to
be the vehicle license fee, which has been rolled back about
two-thirds since 1998 but with the caveat that the full fee could be
restored if the state fell on hard times. Because of that provision,
raising the fee may be considered the most palatable increase at the
Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be one of the options that closes the budget," said
Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), who proposed
legislation suspending the rebate. "As the summer swells, heat rises
and so do the voices in the chambers. We'll be forced to face some
unpleasant realities."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever route Davis chooses Tuesday, it must overcome the
challenge of closing the shortfall and still passing muster with
lawmakers, voters and Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a problem," said Assemblyman John Campbell, the Irvine
Republican who leads his party's caucus on budget matters. "If he
raises taxes, he has a hard time with Republicans.... If he does
everything with spending reductions, he may have some trouble keeping
all the Democrats in line."</TE>
<TE>   After Davis revises his budget proposal Tuesday, the Legislature
will have until June 30 to make its own adjustments and, by a
two-thirds majority vote, send it back to the governor's office. The
deadline is frequently missed, however, and this year's budget
deliberations are expected to extend into July or beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has not revealed how he plans to address the budget gap. But
legislative leaders say they expect him to propose a new round of
spending cuts that--like those he suggested in January--will largely
spare schools and police but not health and human services.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the things we are going to have to do will cause a
backlash from constituents," said Assembly Budget Committee
Chairwoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach). "People are accustomed to a
level of state services that are just not going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for struggling Californians are pushing for tax
increases to help erase the state's revenue shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there ought to be a balanced approach," said Jean Ross,
executive director of the California Budget Project, a group that
advocates for the poor during the budget process. "[Former Gov.] Pete
Wilson understood that and [former Gov.] Ronald Reagan before him
realized that if you have a substantial budget gap, you need to raise
revenues."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson used a combination of cuts and tax increases during the
early 1990s to close a $14-billion hole that materialized in a
$42-billion general fund budget. Davis has to erase a $20-billion
problem in a budget with about $75 billion in general funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly in dollar terms it's the biggest problem we've faced,"
said Brad Williams, senior economist with the state's nonpartisan
legislative analyst's office. "Relative to the size of the budget,
it's starting to approach the magnitude of the early 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Wilson, Davis is facing a multibillion-dollar shortfall
in an election year. Perhaps consequently, the governor has made
clear his desire to balance the state's bank account without raising
taxes while preserving funding for schools and local governments.
Republicans are calling for a similar approach.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating Davis' ability to avoid a tax hike, however, is the
state's plan to borrow $7.5 billion to avoid a cash crunch this
summer. Wall Street bankers may demand that the state have a bigger
revenue stream in place for the deal to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's revised spending plan "is going to have to be
real," Peace said.</TE>
<TE>   Other budget fixes, according to lawmakers, could include
increasing the amount the state plans to borrow against its share of
the national tobacco settlement from $2.4 billion to as much as $4
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also are predicting that an unpopular proposal to defer
state contributions to the California Public Employees' Retirement
System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System may
reappear.</TE>
<TE>   Davis ditched the plan, which would free up hundreds of millions
of dollars, in February. But lawmakers say it may return in a more
palatable form that will cost the state less to repay.</TE>
<TE>   So far, state officials have addressed about $4.3 billion of the
shortfall through cuts and budget changes and by refinancing the
state's debt. Peace predicts that even if the state takes steps to
borrow more and spend less, it will still face a $4-billion to
$5-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   California's budget problems have triggered concern among city and
county officials that legislators will balk at paying local
governments about $4 billion to cover the state-approved vehicle
license fee rollback.</TE>
<TE>   "There's great fear, of course, that the vehicle license fee money
will come into play at some point," said Steve Zehner, a lobbyist and
attorney for Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The county gets about $770 million a year from Sacramento to cover
the tax cut by state lawmakers. The money makes up more than half the
county's $1.1 billion in discretionary funds, which officials say
have taken on new significance in light of Sept. 11 and the increased
security and health-related costs the events spawned.</TE>

<HD>High Price of Free Shelter</HD>
<DH>Transit: Group finds funds to build the structures for Ojai
Valley bus riders after fighting firm's offer that called for ads on
the walls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles firm offered to build bus shelters in the Ojai Valley
free of charge--but there was a catch.</LD>
<LD>   The plexiglass walls to shield bus riders from wind and rain would
also be used for advertising.</LD>
<LD>   That didn't sit well with Robert MacNeal. So he and other Oak View
residents put their heads together and found a way to get the covered
stops built without ads plastered on the sides.</LD>
<TE>   Ten forest-green bus shelters will be installed, starting this
week, along California 33 between Casitas Springs and Mira Monte.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County supervisors are expected to approve the $85,000
project Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very happy that it's finally happening and that we didn't
get steamrolled into accepting the advertising," said MacNeal, a
certified public accountant.</TE>
<TE>   "They were willing to listen to the residents," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It took the citizens committee two years to wade through
government bureaucracy and find the money needed, said Leanna
Kennedy, chairwoman of the grass-roots group.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Supervisor Steve Bennett's office and other county
officials, they secured a $75,250 federal grant.</TE>
<TE>   The county will contribute the remainder, about $9,700, from
Highway 33 road funds and contract the job to a builder. Trash hauler
Consolidated Industries agreed to empty trash bins attached to the
shelters at no cost.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett called the group's work "a classic example of a community
pulling together to get something done."</TE>
<TE>   "They thought there was already too much commercialization,"
Bennett said. "So they found a way to provide the shelters without
the visual pollution."</TE>
<TE>   Buses regularly carry people between Ventura and Ojai. Some stops
have benches, but there have never been any shelters, Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   "When it rains, we really get it," she said. "It also gets very
hot. So this will be a welcome addition."</TE>

<HD>Loan Program Gives Welfare Recipients a Lift</HD>
<DH>Jobs: A Ventura County effort to help workers buy cars and
become more self-sufficient is being imitated throughout the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years on welfare, Corrina Arenas finally had a job. What she
didn't have was a reliable way to get to it.</LD>
<LD>   That was when the government stepped in to help the Oxnard mother
of six. Working with a nonprofit agency, Ventura County social
workers steered Arenas to a 1989 Nissan Maxima. The county also used
public dollars to back her $3,000 car loan.</LD>
<LD>   All of this seemed miraculous to Arenas--she had a spotty credit
history and little income. But getting the bank's nod, and three days
later, a car, helped the 42-year-old counselor get off public aid.</LD>
<TE>   In the two years since, Arenas has moved on to a better vehicle
and an even better job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole different life now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's car ownership program, started four years ago, is
being imitated in various forms throughout the state. Stringent
federal requirements for moving people off welfare rolls are forcing
CalWORKS administrators to fill the gap for those who don't have
their own car and can't use public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything we possibly can to make it a successful
work environment for parents so they can become self-sufficient,"
said June Marcott, deputy director of Orange County's CalWORKS
program.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's Board of Supervisors recently approved a program
similar to Ventura County's and will spend $500,000 a year to back
the loans. Sacramento and San Joaquin counties have taken the idea
one step further, handing over aging county fleet vehicles at no
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "In Sacramento County, we're spread out so far that public
transportation is not an option for some people," said Kerri Aiello,
spokeswoman for the Department of Human Assistance. "We're looking at
this as a way to help people keep their job and maybe get an even
better job."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, things don't always work out. There was the Ventura
County mother of two who seemed a perfect candidate for a car loan.</TE>
<TE>   She made a few payments on her 1992 Hyundai sedan before skipping
town in the car, leaving the county on the hook for her $2,900 loan.
Another woman claimed a car then high-tailed it to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Loan defaults hover around 20%, said Aurora William of Many
Motors, the nonprofit agency that solicits donated cars and screens
drivers for Ventura County. That compares with about 5% for the
general population.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had to pay off $30,000 in bad debt so far," William said.
Ventura County kicked in about $7,000 of that, but the rest comes
from car sales and donations to the nonprofit group, William said.</TE>
<TE>   Helping welfare parents find a way to work has been a major
obstacle for policymakers trying to trim welfare rolls. A 1998 survey
of employers across the country found that 88% identified
transportation as a problem for newly hired welfare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare departments have offered monthly bus passes, van pools,
gas vouchers and repairs for broken-down cars. But a study released
last fall by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in
Washington, D.C., found that for many welfare dependents, a private
vehicle is the best solution.</TE>
<TE>   A parent with a car is more likely to be employed and to work more
hours, the study found. A reliable car widens their job search and
solves scheduling complications that arise in child care
arrangements, said Heidi Goldberg, author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like car ownership is the most practical option,"
Goldberg said. "If it's a loan program, it also helps them learn how
to save, pay back loans and manage their money."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said states and counties should replicate these programs,
using federal welfare dollars, instead of focusing on mass transit.
With the Bush administration proposing expanded work requirements for
welfare recipients, there is even more urgency to fix the problem,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some states have already gotten the message and at least 15 offer
cash to lease or purchase a car--California is not one of them. And
county-supported car programs are starting to pop up all over.</TE>
<TE>   The reason why is simple--it works, said Brian Menzies, president
of Charity Cars Inc. His nonprofit group based in Sanford, Fla., has
been giving away donated cars for six years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much smoke and mirrors about bus passes, light rail
and mass transportation," Menzies said. "But the people who own
Lexuses are not going to hop on the bus, are they? So why should a
single mother who's trying to get a job? It's the difference between
having an existence and having a full life."</TE>
<TE>   People donate cars and Menzies' group pays for any repairs.
Participants must have a job, a clean driving record and proof of
insurance. Cars that are salvaged are used to fix up the newer ones
and pay for warranties, Menzies said.</TE>
<TE>   "People will say, 'Why don't you make them give some sweat equity
to earn those cars?'" he said. "Well, I've been poor. I know how much
these people have already suffered. You know what they can do for me?
They can become successful."</TE>
<TE>   Some welfare agencies, however, are putting their own proposals on
hold.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County has suspended its plan until officials see what
the fallout is from the state's projected $20-billion deficit. Los
Angeles County--with the largest welfare population in the state--is
not even considering one.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of low-income people who don't have vehicles whose
lives would be much improved if they had one," said Phillip Ansell, a
spokesman for the county's Department of Public Social Services. "But
there's no way that we have sufficient funding to respond to that
need."</TE>
<TE>   Those counties and others, however, said they will be watching the
programs closely to see how well they succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento and San Joaquin counties' ownership programs are nearly
identical to the Charity Cars program in Florida. The biggest
difference is that the cars are not donated but purchased from the
county's own fleet of vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Pink slips stay in the county's possession for one year. If the
recipient holds down a job and has no driving problems, the county
signs over the title, said Sacramento County's Aiello. The program
costs $250,000 a year, money the county draws from CalWORKS incentive
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento County was swamped with calls after it gave away its
first two cars in January, a 1994 Ford Escort and a 1991 Dodge van,
Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who got the van has five daughters and was so grateful
she was speechless, Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   San Joaquin County has given away 40 cars in the last three years,
said Richard Vote, the Human Service Agency's deputy director. One
mother became an ironworker, joined the union and returned the car to
the county, Vote said.</TE>
<TE>   Vote said the county tried van pools, but found they didn't work
well because of long distances between job sites. The car giveaways
work best when a parent is motivated to work but has problems getting
to a job, he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Ventura County officials designed their program in 1998, they
had a different model in mind. Supervisors were opposed to just
handing cars over. They also didn't want to commit a lot of taxpayer
dollars to the program.</TE>
<TE>   So the county agreed to back the first few loans that were
approved; after that, the program was handed off to Many Motors to
administer. Advocates say forcing participants to pay for their car
fosters self-respect.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't want charity," said Thousand Oaks-based Supervisor
Frank Schillo, who helped launch the program.</TE>
<TE>   "They really appreciate the fact that they have the ability to buy
a car. That really means something to them. It buys them independence
that they have earned."</TE>
<TE>   For Arenas, the opportunity to get a loan came at just the right
time.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were threatening to take away the youngest of her six
children when she was battling a heroin addiction three years ago.
The scare prompted her to clean up her life.</TE>
<TE>   She was offered a job as a counselor at a battered women's shelter
in Ventura, about seven miles from her home. Riding the bus wouldn't
work, Arenas said, because she had to drop her younger children off
at school and then pick them up at child care at the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Her social worker urged her to fill out an application with Many
Motors. A screening committee disregarded the fact that she had
unpaid credit card bills and that she had never before taken out a
loan.</TE>
<TE>   After an over-the-phone credit counseling session, the bank
working with Many Motors gave Arenas a check for $3,000. She calls it
"the beginning of my new life."</TE>
<TE>   Now sober for more than three years, Arenas in January was hired
as a drug and alcohol counselor for a county program. She has moved
on to a newer van, but is still making payments on the Maxima.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe $600 now," she said proudly. "I'm supposed to pay it off in
2003, but I'm going to be early."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's program is slightly different because the county
plans to buy the used cars from lots.</TE>
<TE>   The county also has agreed to pay for the first six months of
insurance and to pay any losses due to loan defaults.</TE>
<TE>   CalWORKS administrators figure they can offer 100 cars a year, at
an average $5,000 price, when the program is launched in July.</TE>
<TE>   Marcott said officials will work closely with parents to make sure
they are making payments. But they are gambling that most will meet
their obligation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we're planning to become the repo police," she
said. "I guess we'll talk about that when it happens."</TE>

<HD>Car Loan Program Gives Area Welfare Recipients a Lift</HD>
<DH>Jobs: Ventura County effort helps them be more
self-sufficient and move off public aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years on welfare, Corrina Arenas finally had a job. What she
didn't have was a reliable way to get to it.</LD>
<LD>   That was when the government stepped in to help the Oxnard mother
of six. Working with a nonprofit agency, Ventura County social
workers steered Arenas to a 1989 Nissan Maxima. The county also used
public dollars to back her $3,000 car loan.</LD>
<LD>   All of this seemed miraculous to Arenas--she had a spotty credit
history and little income. But getting the bank's nod, and three days
later, a car, helped the 42-year-old counselor get off public aid.</LD>
<TE>   In the two years since, Arenas has moved on to a better vehicle
and an even better job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole different life now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's car ownership program, started four years ago, is
being imitated in various forms across the state. Stringent federal
requirements for moving people off welfare rolls are forcing CalWORKS
administrators to fill the gap for those who don't have their own car
and can't use public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything we possibly can to make it a successful
work environment for parents so they can become self-sufficient,"
said June Marcott, deputy director of Orange County's CalWORKS
program.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's Board of Supervisors recently approved a program
similar to Ventura County's and will spend $500,000 a year to back
the loans. Sacramento and San Joaquin counties have taken the idea
one step further, handing over aging county fleet vehicles at no
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "In Sacramento County, we're spread out so far that public
transportation is not an option for some people," said Kerri Aiello,
spokeswoman for the Department of Human Assistance. "We're looking at
this as a way to help people keep their job and maybe get an even
better job."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, things don't always work out. There was the Ventura
County mother of two who seemed a perfect candidate for a car loan.</TE>
<TE>   She made a few payments on her 1992 Hyundai sedan before skipping
town in the car, leaving the county on the hook for her $2,900 loan.
Another woman claimed a car then high-tailed it to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Loan defaults hover around 20%, said Aurora William of Many
Motors, the nonprofit agency that solicits donated cars and screens
drivers for Ventura County. That compares with about 5% for the
general population.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had to pay off $30,000 in bad debt so far," William said.
Ventura County kicked in about $7,000 of that, but the rest comes
from car sales and donations to the nonprofit group, William said.</TE>
<TE>   Helping welfare parents find a way to work has been a major
obstacle for policymakers trying to trim welfare rolls. A 1998 survey
of employers across the country found that 88% identified
transportation as a problem for newly hired welfare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare departments have offered monthly bus passes, van pools,
gas vouchers and repairs for broken-down cars. But a study released
last fall by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in
Washington, D.C., found that for many welfare dependents, a private
vehicle is the best solution.</TE>
<TE>   A parent with a car is more likely to be employed and to work more
hours, the study found. A reliable car widens his or her job search
and solves scheduling complications that arise in child care
arrangements, said Heidi Goldberg, author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like car ownership is the most practical option,"
Goldberg said. "If it's a loan program, it also helps them learn how
to save, pay back loans and manage their money."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg says states and counties should replicate these programs,
using federal welfare dollars, instead of focusing on mass transit.
With the Bush administration proposing expanded work requirements for
welfare recipients, there is even more urgency to fix the problem,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some states have already gotten the message and at least 15 offer
cash to lease or purchase a car--California is not one of them. And
county-supported car programs are starting to pop up all over.</TE>
<TE>   The reason why is simple--it works, said Brian Menzies, president
of Charity Cars Inc. His nonprofit group based in Sanford, Fla., has
been giving away donated cars for six years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much smoke and mirrors about bus passes, light rail
and mass transportation," Menzies said. "But the people who own
Lexuses are not going to hop on the bus, are they? So why should a
single mother who's trying to get a job? It's the difference between
having an existence and having a full life."</TE>
<TE>   People donate cars and Menzies' group pays for any repairs.
Participants must have a job, a clean driving record and proof of
insurance. Cars that are salvaged are used to fix up the newer ones
and pay for warranties, Menzies said.</TE>
<TE>   "People will say, 'Why don't you make them give some sweat equity
to earn those cars?'" he said. "Well, I've been poor. I know how much
these people have already suffered. You know what they can do for me?
They can become successful."</TE>
<TE>   Some welfare agencies, however, are putting their own proposals on
hold.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County has suspended its plan until officials see what
the fallout is from the state's projected $20-billion deficit. Los
Angeles County--with the largest welfare population in the state--is
not even considering one.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of low-income people who don't have vehicles whose
lives would be much improved if they had one," said Phillip Ansell, a
spokesman for the county's Department of Public Social Services. "But
there's no way that we have sufficient funding to respond to that
need."</TE>
<TE>   Those counties and others, however, said they will be watching the
programs closely to see how well they succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento and San Joaquin counties' ownership programs are nearly
identical to the Charity Cars program in Florida. The biggest
difference is that the cars are not donated but purchased from the
county's own fleet of vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Pink slips stay in the county's possession for one year. If the
recipient holds down a job and has no driving problems, the county
signs over the title, said Sacramento County's Aiello. The program
costs $250,000 a year, money the county draws from CalWORKS incentive
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento County was swamped with calls after it gave away its
first two cars in January, a 1994 Ford Escort and a 1991 Dodge van,
Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who got the van has five daughters and was so grateful
she was speechless, Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   San Joaquin County has given away 40 cars in the past three years,
said Richard Vote, the Human Service Agency's deputy director. One
mother became an ironworker, joined the union and returned the car to
the county, Vote said.</TE>
<TE>   "She told us to give it to someone who needs it. Then she went out
and bought her own car," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Ventura County officials designed their program in 1998, they
had a different model in mind. Supervisors were opposed to just
handing cars over. They also didn't want to commit a lot of taxpayer
dollars to the program.</TE>
<TE>   So the county agreed to back the first few loans that were
approved; after that, the program was handed off to Many Motors to
administer. Advocates say forcing participants to pay for their cars
fosters self-respect.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't want charity," said Thousand Oaks-based Supervisor
Frank Schillo, who helped launch the program.</TE>
<TE>   "They really appreciate the fact that they have the ability to buy
a car. That really means something to them. It buys them independence
that they have earned."</TE>
<TE>   For Arenas, the opportunity to get a loan came at just the right
time.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were threatening to take away the youngest of her six
children when she was battling a heroin addiction three years ago.
The scare prompted her to clean up her life.</TE>
<TE>   She was offered a job as a counselor at a battered women's shelter
in Ventura, about seven miles from her home. Riding the bus wouldn't
work, Arenas said, because she had to drop her younger children off
at school and then pick them up at child care at the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Her social worker urged her to fill out an application with Many
Motors. A screening committee disregarded the fact that she had
unpaid credit card bills and that she had never before taken out a
loan.</TE>
<TE>   After an over-the-phone credit counseling session, the bank
working with Many Motors gave Arenas a check for $3,000. She calls it
"the beginning of my new life."</TE>
<TE>   Now sober for more than three years, Arenas in January was hired
as a drug and alcohol counselor for a county program. She has moved
on to a newer van, but is still making payments on the Maxima.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe $600 now," she said proudly. "I'm supposed to pay it off in
2003, but I'm going to be early."</TE>
<TE>   CalWORKS administrators figure they can offer 100 cars a year, at
an average $5,000 price, when the program is launched in July.</TE>
<TE>   Marcott said officials will work closely with parents to make sure
they are making payments. But they are gambling that most will meet
their obligation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we're planning to become the repo police," she
said. "I guess we'll talk about that when it happens."</TE>

<HD>James Collins Jr., 84; General, Military Historian</HD>

<AU>BART BARNES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Lawton Collins Jr., an Army brigadier general and military
historian who directed the Army's military history program for 12
years, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Collins, who lived in Washington, D.C., died Monday of a pulmonary
embolism at his country home in Middleburg, Va.</LD>
<LD>   During a 42-year military career, Collins led a World War II
artillery battalion of North Dakota National Guardsmen ashore at Utah
Beach during the 1944 D-day invasion of Normandy. He later served in
Korea and Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   A linguist who was fluent in French, Italian, German and Spanish,
he was a former commanding officer of the Army language school in
Monterey, Calif., and from 1959 to 1962 was the first director of a
coordinated Defense Language Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He also spoke some Russian, and was an intelligence officer at
times during his career.</TE>
<TE>   As a military historian, he wrote studies and articles on the
Vietnam War and was an editor of World War II histories, including
the "D-Day Encyclopedia," which he co-edited with David Chandler of
Britain's Royal Military Academy.</TE>
<TE>   The work contains articles by more than 100 military historians,
and personal battlefield accounts ranging from Collins' experience
leading his men ashore in France on June 6, 1944, to Manfred Rommel's
description of his father, German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who
tried to anticipate and repel the Allied invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his retirement from the Army in 1982, Collins embarked on a
second career as a member of a Virginia wine cooperative and a grower
of vinifera grapes at his Middleburg home.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the Class of 1939 at West Point, Collins was born in
El Paso into a family steeped in Army tradition.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Maj. Gen. James Lawton Collins, was an aide de camp to
Gen. John J. Pershing, who commanded the American Expeditionary
Forces during World War I. Pershing was godfather to the future Gen.
Collins.</TE>
<TE>   His uncle was Gen. Joseph Lawton "Lightning Joe" Collins, who
would become Army chief of staff during the Korean War. During World
War II, James Collins Jr. would serve under his uncle with VII Corps
in France.</TE>
<TE>   Astronaut Michael Collins, who as an Air Force colonel would
participate in the Gemini X and Apollo XI space flights, is the
younger brother of James Collins Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his Army career at Camp Gruber, Okla., James Lawton
Collins Jr. was assigned to command a unit of the North Dakota
National Guard, which had been federalized to fight in World War II.
Those were the men he would lead on D-day as the 957th Field
Artillery Battalion.</TE>
<TE>   His later Army career included service at NATO headquarters in
Europe, two years in Vietnam as special assistant to Gen. William
Westmoreland, three years in Washington as deputy assistant chief of
staff for intelligence and three years in Germany as commander of V
Corps artillery.</TE>
<TE>   While serving in the Army, he received a master's degree in
foreign affairs from the University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Collins officially retired in 1969 but was recalled to active duty
in 1970 as chief of military history for the Army.</TE>
<TE>   He was a former president of the U.S. Commission on Military
History and the Council on America's Military Past, and a member of
the International Commission of Military Historians, which was formed
to investigate the World War II service as a Nazi officer of Austrian
President and former United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Yolande de Mauduit Collins; four
children; one brother; two sisters; and seven grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Slaying of 2 Teens Ends Streak in Huntington</HD>
<DH>Crime: The city had gone 21/2 years without a homicide
until the pair were gunned down in the Oak View area. Relatives
suspect gang rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two teenage boys who reportedly belonged to a local street gang were
fatally shot early Saturday in the Oak View section of Huntington
Beach, the first slayings in the city in nearly 2 1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   Heriberto Tapia Vasquez, 16, and his close friend, Oscar Gaytan,
18, were shot as they walked though the intersection of Wagon Drive
and Nichols Street about 12:50 a.m., police and relatives said.</LD>
<LD>   Gaytan fell where he was shot, but Vasquez managed to run a block
east. He collapsed on the steps of an apartment complex where an
older sister lived, friends and relatives said.</LD>
<TE>   One of Vasquez's brothers was at the sister's apartment and saw
his sibling collapse with a bullet wound in his back, relatives said.
The brother cradled Vasquez on the concrete steps as the teen died,
said the victim's sister, Beatriz Vasquez. "My brother had him in his
arms, saying, 'Don't leave us.' He was struggling to breathe," said
Beatriz, 15.</TE>
<TE>   While friends and relatives of the victims said they suspected
rival gang members, police said they had not identified any suspects
and were unsure about a motive.</TE>
<TE>   The killings were the first in Huntington Beach since Nov. 27,
1999, when Bridgette Ballas, a 29-year-old Calvin Klein account
executive, was found raped and bludgeoned to death. A neighbor of
Ballas' is awaiting trial in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's shooting took place in one of the city's poorest and
most crime-plagued neighborhoods, an area of tightly packed
apartments near Beach Boulevard and Slater Avenue. Police have tried
for years to curb gang violence in Oak View, but relations between
police and residents have at times grown tense.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 neighbors and relatives of the slain teens laid candles
and flowers at the site of the shooting Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives said Vasquez and Gaytan belonged to the
South Side gang. Both had had run-ins with authorities, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives described Gaytan as a loving father of a 1-year-old boy
and said he had been looking for a job since being released from
Juvenile Hall a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was going to change," said a younger brother, Danny
Gaytan, 14.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez's family recalled the boy as a soccer-loving teen with a
fondness for action movies.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't a troublemaker," his mother, Guadalupe Vasquez, said in
Spanish. "I don't want the police to forget about this. I want the
police to find his killers."</TE>

<HD>Family's Kin Face Huge Loss</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: They hold group prayers and share memories of four
family members killed in fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitaben Patel used to tell her daughter-in-law, "If you leave, you'd
better take me with you. Don't leave me behind."</LD>
<LD>   That tender request echoes in the minds of Patel's friends and
relatives.</LD>
<LD>   On May 4, the 63-year-old woman was found burned beyond
recognition in the family's Hollywood Hills home, along with her
son's wife, Gita Kumar, 42, and her grandchildren, Paras Kumar, 18,
and Tulsi Kumar, 16.</LD>
<TE>   The fire, which was intentionally set, swept through the
close-knit family's three-bedroom home overlooking the Hollywood
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   When firefighters arrived, they saw Patel's son, Harish "Harry"
Kumar, 47, standing on the lawn, screaming for help, saying his
family was inside. Relatives have been told by police that the bodies
were all found in one bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   A business attorney for the Kumars said $3,000 to $4,000 in cash
was missing from the Lakeridge Drive home. The money, proceeds from
the family's three hotels, was being counted at home that evening.</TE>
<TE>   There are no suspects in a case that an investigator has called "a
real whodunit."</TE>
<TE>   Since the deaths, relatives--close and distant--have gathered from
across the country. "Everybody just dropped whatever they were doing
and came," said Kirrit Bhikha, a brother-in-law who hopped on the
first plane from Nashville the morning after the fire.</TE>
<TE>   The relatives hold group prayers, pore over old photographs and
share memories.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God they all went together, at least," said Sagar Kumar, a
19-year-old cousin who grew up alongside the teenagers. "Those four
were just inseparable."</TE>
<TE>   Eight years ago, Patel left India after her husband died and moved
in with her son's family. She became very attached to his wife. Gita
Kumar, in turn, took care of her mother-in-law, buying her small but
thoughtful gifts when she went on trips.</TE>
<TE>   Friends remembered how "Grandma," a petite woman who always wore
traditional Indian garb and combed her hair into a neat bun, would
urge them to eat whenever they visited. She was always cheerful, and
the young people said they liked to joke around with her.</TE>
<TE>   "We always tried to teach her slang, like, 'What's up, dawg?'"
Sagar Kumar said. "She would copy us and laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Sagar and his cousins were born in Odessa, Texas, where both
families lived for many years and got their start in the motel
business. Later, the two families moved to the Los Angeles area
together.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw each other every day, and we were just like one big
family," he said. "We called ourselves the Brady Bunch."</TE>
<TE>   In Paras, a freshman studying business at UC San Diego, Sagar had
an intimate friend who was a straight-A student and the life of the
party. "He was a genius," said Sagar, who attends UC Irvine. "He gave
everyone motivation to excel."</TE>
<TE>   Sagar would poke fun at Paras' big ears, and Sagar said he would
tease him in return about his transparent sunglasses by calling him
J-Lo. They drove home from college nearly every weekend to be with
their family.</TE>
<TE>   Tulsi was the little sister who "liked making people happy," Sagar
said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends recalled Tulsi showing up with a bag filled with Del Taco
breakfast burritos on the morning they took their SAT examinations,
Tulsi staying up late to help friends finish homework and treating
them to the movies or a meal.</TE>
<TE>   "She never let us pay," said friend Angie Juarez. "She said that
if we paid her back, then we weren't her real friends."</TE>
<TE>   Tulsi had a habit of telling friends she loved them, though some
didn't always say it back.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that she's gone, we say it more," Susana Duarte said of the
group of a dozen or so friends who congregated at a makeshift
memorial outside the Kumars' home. "Now, when we say goodbye, it's
not just 'Bye!' It's goodbye with a hug."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives agreed that Gita Kumar was the glue that held the family
together.</TE>
<TE>   Born in England and arranged by her family to marry Harish Kumar
after she immigrated to the United States, she was a savvy
businesswoman and a partner with her husband in their motel ventures.</TE>
<TE>   She was equally at ease in her children's world, lip-synching to
Tupac Shakur's rap music--her daughter's favorite--and mothering

cook. She could sew. She could climb ladders to third-story roofs to

<DH>Blaze: At least 3,200 acres burn eight miles northeast of
Santa Clarita, though few structures are destroyed.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wildfire with a smoke plume that could be seen at least 40 miles
away charred at least 3,200 acres Saturday in the Angeles National
Forest, threatening cabins and forcing evacuations in a steep,
chaparral-covered canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The wind-fed blaze in Bouquet Canyon, about eight miles northeast
of Santa Clarita, signaled an early start to the fire season in
Southern California after a dry winter, fire officials said.
Firefighters were expected to battle the blaze overnight.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies drove from cabin to cabin, knocking on doors
and telling people to leave the area. The smoke plume could be seen
in the Lancaster area, said Sheriff's Lt. Gordon Carn in the
Lancaster substation.</LD>
<TE>   By early evening, flames had destroyed an outhouse and a shed, but
firefighters said the cabins appeared to be safe.</TE>
<TE>   The number of evacuees was not available.</TE>
<TE>   One cabin dweller said she was so spooked, she was moving out of
the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Porter, a California Institute of the Arts student who lives
with her fiance, said it was the second fire this year to threaten
her cabin. "We thought, 'How romantic, a cabin in the woods.' But it
hasn't been romantic, it's been a nightmare. We're moving out at the
end of the month."</TE>
<TE>   At least 650 firefighters from the U.S. Forest Service and the Los
Angeles County Fire Department fought the blaze, aided by
water-dropping aircraft, Forest Service spokeswoman Gail Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   With dry brush and very little rain, the blaze is evidence that
the fire season has begun in earnest for the Angeles Forest, Wright
said. "We anticipate a hot dry summer with high fire danger," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials last month predicted the fire season in much of
Southern California would start earlier than usual because of one of
the driest winters on record. In a normal year, the fire season
starts in mid-May, but some Southern California agencies, including
the Forest Service, declared it underway in mid-April.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters said they thought they had the upper hand on the
blaze early in the day, but it jumped a road several times and raced
out of control.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was reported about 10:30 a.m. and had spread to 230 acres
within two hours. By late afternoon, flames whipped by gusty winds
had consumed nearly 1,000 acres. Fire officials said they could not
predict when the blaze might be contained.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have people on it all night," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the cabins are recreational residences used seasonally or
on weekends, but some people live there year-round, Wright said. Many
of the structures were built in the 1930s, she said.</TE>

<DH>Health: Beach cities' program matches the elderly and
disabled with volunteers who can run errands and provide emotional
support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes they play cards--Skip-Bo and Uno are favorites--while other
times they listen to music and just talk. And occasionally they go
for rides in the younger woman's vintage Mustang, taking in ocean
vistas from the Palos Verdes Peninsula or checking out the Hollywood
landmarks etched deep in the older woman's memory.</LD>
<LD>   "And we always have a good laugh. We're generally in very good
spirits," said Babs Aydelott, speaking of her four-year friendship
with Delia Magee, a client of a multifaceted program to help the
elderly and disabled of Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Redondo
Beach lead independent, fulfilling lives.</LD>
<LD>   Aydelott is a volunteer with the Friend to Friend component of the
Beach Cities Health District's Community Care Services program. After
a training period (with sessions held in the evenings to accommodate
volunteers' work or school schedules), the volunteers, ages 18 and
up, are paired with elderly or disabled clients with whom they visit
at least one hour a week. Volunteers have periodic follow-up meetings
with district staff members who provide support and advice as needed.</LD>
<TE>   "We're here really just to be a friend, a good listener," Aydelott
said. "It's a very simple, flexible way to help someone else. It
doesn't require much time, and you can do it after work or on
weekends."</TE>
<TE>   But such a simple act makes a big difference to someone who is
lonely and has a hard time getting out and about, said Marilyn
Rafkin, director of Community Care Services for the health district,
which serves residents of the three South Bay cities.</TE>
<TE>   Together with two other volunteer programs, Peer Counselors and
Errand Volunteers, Friend to Friend helps the health district stretch
its dollars and reach more clients than its tight budget would
otherwise allow, Rafkin said. Because volunteers are given training
and work closely with the professional staff, they can provide
high-quality service, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Peer counselors are older adults who are trained to provide fellow
seniors with confidential emotional support and encouragement. Errand
volunteers help elderly or disabled clients shop for groceries or
pick up prescriptions. They also provide rides to doctors'
appointments or outings at senior centers.</TE>
<TE>   "Just these small services and visits can make a huge difference,"
Rafkin said. "Sometimes they are all that people need to be able to
stay in their homes."</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers are an integral part of the program Rafkin
oversees. After a prospective client is referred by a physician,
clergy member or agency, one of Rafkin's staff of care managers makes
a home visit to assess the person's needs and help set goals.</TE>
<TE>   Clients can receive help with laundry and other household duties,
gain access to health and fitness programs and participate in at
least one of 12 support groups. The program has served 527 people so
far this year in its care management program and 157 in support
groups. There is a waiting list for some services.</TE>
<TE>   The program is funded entirely by the health district. Grants from
foundations, and especially from the government, are difficult to
obtain because clients live in the largely affluent beach cities. But
that doesn't mean they can afford to pay for their own services,
Rafkin said, noting that 82% of the care management clients have
annual incomes of less than $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "People think of the beach cities as pretty affluent, but this is
a sort of hidden population. Many of the elderly moved here in the
1940s and 1950s," when the beach towns were affordable and made up of
middle-class and blue-collar neighborhoods, she noted.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers are always needed, even if they can give just an hour
or two a week, Rafkin said. The program can be reached at
www.bchd.org or (310) 374-3426, Ext. 144.</TE>
<TE>   Aydelott, for example, fits time with Magee around her work as a
travel agent and part-time kitchen manager for a Manhattan Beach
synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Magee said she owes much to the community care program. Her
physician referred her eight years ago, when she had undergone heart
bypass surgery shortly after moving to senior citizens' housing run
by the Salvation Army in Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "He was afraid I was going into depression. I didn't know how I
was going to manage. I was a mess," said the long-divorced Magee, now
a lively, outgoing 75. She started with a peer counselor and, as she
progressed, was switched to the Friend to Friend program. There she
met Aydelott.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many good times. We are real friends," Magee said as
the two sat one recent afternoon in Aydelott's comfortable beach
cottage, one block from the sand in the El Porto section of Manhattan
Beach. They talked about their favorite music, the poetry they like
to read together and the swing-dancing classes they took</TE>
<TE>   Aydelott said she, too, has benefited from the friendship, perhaps
even more than Magee.</TE>
<TE>   "Volunteering takes you out of yourself and introduces you to some
wonderful people with wonderful stories," Aydelott said. "As time
goes on, I am finding it more and more of a privilege to spend time
with Delia. She is an open, giving person; she has a heart full of
love."</TE>

<HD>Illegal Immigrants' Best Form of ID Is Ingenuity</HD>
<DH>Law: Anaheim family navigates the economy creatively.
Mexican consular cards and a bill allowing driver's licenses might
help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gustavo Rodriguez holds a job, paid for a car on the installment plan
and even owns a home filled with furniture bought on credit.</LD>
<LD>   None of this comes easy for illegal immigrants such as Rodriguez,
who use their ingenuity to find their place in American life without
identification or credit.</LD>
<LD>   Credit agencies have no history on them. Insurance companies
cannot insure their cars because they can't get a driver's license.
Even a trip to the video store can be a challenge.</LD>
<TE>   The issue is in the forefront of official debate these days, as
Gov. Gray Davis reconsiders AB 60, the bill that would give driver's
licenses to some illegal immigrants, and as cities and even some
banks throughout the state are beginning to accept a Mexican
identification card, the matricula consular, as valid ID. The Los
Angeles City Council will consider Tuesday whether its police should
accept the cards.</TE>
<TE>   "I could contribute more to the U.S. economy if I had
[identification]," said Rodriguez, a 27-year-old Anaheim resident
with a wife and two children. He could pay taxes or open a business.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, necessity has bred inventiveness. Many of
California's estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants have developed
a repertoire of ways to gain a piece of the good life. They rely on
an extended community of family and friends. Without credit
histories, they coax stores into offering credit nonetheless. They
find employers who will hire without work papers.</TE>
<TE>   The Rodriguezes' situation affords a peek into how one family
manages to establish themselves while, in the eyes of the U.S.
government and mainstream economy, they don't exist.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo Rodriguez immigrated to Santa Ana alone, 10 years ago.
There, he met his future wife, whose parents are living here legally,
though she remains undocumented after living outside the United
States intermittently. She declined to allow her name to be used.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, whose children are 3 years and 18 months, eke out a
modest but comfortable living.</TE>
<TE>   The father works full time for a company that makes equipment for
carwashes. The boss is willing to overlook his lack of legal work
authorization. He is paid in cash, which skirts the need for a Social
Security number. That also means, though, that the federal and state
governments collect no taxes on his pay.</TE>
<TE>   The cash--$560 a week from his job and a side business selling
jewelry--also means he can avoid check-cashing services, which most
immigrants use because they don't open bank accounts. The service
costs about 1% of the check.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, 26, a 1993 graduate of Santa Ana High School, hoped to
become a secretary, but without documents, she works as a maid. She
makes about $300 a week and also pays no income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many illegal immigrants, she is lucky enough to have a Bank
of America account obtained years ago under a former bank policy that
allowed minors to have accounts if the bank knew the family. That
account has sustained the family with the ability to write checks for
bills, and with debit cards that can be used at many stores.</TE>
<TE>   Without ID, Gustavo Rodriguez cannot open an account, so he
regularly uses his wife's debit card at any store that doesn't check
the name on the card.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America and several other banks recently changed their
policies to allow Mexican nationals with official Mexican
identification to open accounts. Tax on any interest is withheld and
sent to the federal government. Rodriguez hopes to get one of those
ID cards soon.</TE>
<TE>   But renting videos at the local Blockbuster is out. Blockbuster
spokesman Randy Hargrove said the chain requires renters to have two
forms of identification, including a driver's license, a military
identification or state identification, to gain membership. So the
Rodriguez family uses two small video stores that don't have such
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The family has always managed to find housing. Several years ago,
Gustavo Rodriguez found a studio apartment in Santa Ana whose
landlord didn't require a credit check. His wife's relatives knew the
manager.</TE>
<TE>   The setup worked until the couple had two children and wanted a
house.</TE>
<TE>   So they decided to buy a home with his in-laws as co-owners. The
couple and their children live with the wife's parents in a yellow
three-bedroom house in Anaheim that cost $241,000. He and his wife
make half of the monthly mortgage payment, handing over $1,100. Their
names are on the deed but not on the mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Spending what remains is often a headache. He has been rejected
for credit at several stores, including Sam's Club. He often must
bring needs to bring wads of cash for shopping.</TE>
<TE>   But when he bought his living room furniture set, he was able to
get credit from La Canasta Furniture Store in Santa Ana, part of a
chain that extends credit to many illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez put down $50 for the powder-blue love seat and matching
sectional sofa that cost $800. He probably paid about $1,100 for the
set because he was likely charged 16.85% annual interest on the
balance, said Canasta President Javier Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said his eight stores offer credit to illegal immigrants
because "we trust them." He acknowledges that if they defaulted, he
would have little way to find them. Still, he said, the delinquency
rate is no different from that of customers with a traditional credit
history, and his flexibility let him to tap into a big market.</TE>
<TE>   When Gustavo Rodriguez wanted a car, he bought a 1985 Chevrolet
Caprice from a friend who allowed him to pay him the $1,200 in
installments. He registered the car--that's allowed for illegal
immigrants--but couldn't insure it because he has no driver's
license. He's afraid to drive it, though. If he is stopped by police
for a traffic infraction or an accident, he would be arrested for
driving without a license and then the case might be referred to
immigration officials. Most days, a friend picks him up to go to
work.</TE>
<TE>   A vacation presented another challenge. The family recently went
to Las Vegas, where Rodriguez was peeved when security guards at
Circus Circus asked him for photo identification. When he could not
provide any, he was told he could not play roulette. Rodriguez
assumed illegal immigrants could not play. But a casino supervisor
who would identify himself only as Gary said the casino is not
interested in gamblers' immigration status. More likely, Rodriguez,
who is young-looking for his age, was stopped in a routine check for
underage gamblers. "If someone looks between 21 and 30, they will be
carded," the supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez would like to be able to escape such embarrassing
episodes while bettering his lot. He wanted to open a business, but a
business permit requires a Social Security number, so he sells his
jewelry where he can, on the streets and to friends.</TE>
<TE>   He and other illegal immigrants have become more nervous recently
about their lack of identification, with recent publicity about
immigrants being deported after being stopped by police on minor
matters.</TE>
<TE>   But Anaheim police and all police departments in Orange County,
Sacramento, Oakland and San Francisco recently agreed to accept the
Mexican identification card.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Wells Fargo and Bank of America began
accepting the matriculas to open accounts. Airlines will accept them
as identification for domestic flights and trips to Mexico. Now the
Mexican Consulate is working to get the card widely accepted by
government agencies and businesses throughout the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Such moves anger activists opposed to illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Coe, founder of the California Coalition for Immigration
Reform, said big business benefits from hiring low-wage workers like
Rodriguez while taxpayers pick up the tab for social services and
education they may need.</TE>
<TE>   Illegal immigrants "are criminals," she said. "End of discussion.
They are here in violation of federal law."</TE>
<TE>   To Coe's dismay, a proposed state bill would allow illegal
immigrants to qualify for a driver's license if they can show they
are seeking citizenship or permanent residency and meet other
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The author, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), said he does
not know how many people are on the roads without licenses--and thus
without auto insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "By allowing immigrants in the process of legalizing their status
to drive, we acknowledge two factors," he said. "First, this is a
public safety issue that affects all Californians. Second, immigrants
are deeply embedded in our economy."</TE>
<TE>   Davis vetoed the bill last year but is negotiating with Cedillo to
see how the licenses could be granted. The Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund recently sued the state, saying the bill
inadvertently became law last year because of a clerical error and
should be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Without the ability to get a license, illegal immigrants turn to
matriculas as a last resort. Rodriguez took off a day of work
recently to obtain his at the consulate office in Santa Ana. He was
there by 4 a.m.--but found himself behind a line of people who had
shown up even earlier.</TE>
<TE>   By 9 a.m., more than 200 people waited. Still in line six hours
after arriving, Rodriguez got the bad news from a guard. He would
have to return another day. Too many people getting matriculas today.
But he was given an appointment for this week.</TE>

Francisco. He was 19 and in an American internment camp when drafted.
He refused to serve in the U.S. military, and was imprisoned. The

resisters as traitors in the 1940s, apologized Saturday.</CP>

<HD>Tackling the NFL's Idea for a New Stadium</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Anschutz, call me immediately.</LD>
<LD>   I know you're a billionaire, but go ahead and call collect. I'm
well aware that guys like you don't get that stupidly rich without
learning how to do business on someone else's dime.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, just ring me up at 1-800-LATIMES. We'll have operators
standing by, waiting for your call. And listen, Phil, don't hand this
off to one of your flunkies. I already tried getting hold of you
through one of those sports, and here's the useless message he left
me:</LD>
<TE>   "We really have not publicly commented on any part of the process
at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah. That's why I was calling, professor.</TE>
<TE>   The "process" he referred to is bringing a National Football
League franchise to L.A., possibly in a downtown stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That's right, folks. Anschutz, who isn't even from here, was in
New York last week talking up NFL officials about possibly
transforming the face of downtown Los Angeles for generations to
come, and the "process" is top-secret stuff, leaving you and me
entirely out of the loop. No one has even bothered to ask whether any
of us wants a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   By the strangest of coincidences, Los Angeles City Council members
tripped over themselves in a mad dash to vote yes on a downtown
redevelopment plan last week, even as Denver resident Anschutz and
his crew--which includes a few Southern California boys with nearly
as much money as Anschutz--were lobbying the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Look, we're out in the sun a lot here in L.A., but we're not
completely daft.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment authorities are supposed to be for blighted areas,
not the kind of prime real estate surrounding Staples Center. So why
include it in a district that will divert taxes from general funds
and plow them into redevelopment projects? Perhaps because that makes
it easier to finance a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine what it was like at that meeting in New York?</TE>
<TE>   I can see NFL bosses asking the Anschutz crew if it's got L.A.
public officials in the sack. Fade to a room full of sly grins. It's
probably harder to get a Hollywood hooker in the sack.</TE>
<TE>   Stadium backers had lobbied city officials to approve the
redevelopment plan, and something tells you the motivating principle
was something other than a teeming passion for urban renewal and
human reclamation.</TE>
<TE>   They met with, among others, Slim Jim Hahn. So why have we heard
scarcely a peep out of our fearless mayor on such an epic
undertaking? Everyone else but him is talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   Well at least the mayor, unlike Punxsutawney Phil Anschutz, popped
out of his gopher hole and returned my call Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The reason he hasn't had much to say, Hahn claimed, is that he
doesn't know of a specific stadium plan, even though the Anschutz
gang called him from New York on Thursday to report that the meeting
with the NFL was going well.</TE>
<TE>   There were no specifics, according to Hahn. They didn't call him
back when the meetings were done, and he didn't call them to find out
what happened.</TE>
<TE>   When my eyeballs sprang back into my head, I wasn't sure how to
respond. Either Hahn wasn't being entirely truthful with me, or--and
this is the more horrifying possibility--he was.</TE>
<TE>   How can the mayor of Los Angeles not know every last detail of a
high-level discussion among billionaires and NFL pooh-bahs on the
subject of bringing a franchise to the burg he runs? Wouldn't you be
the least bit curious about how it went, given that these guys might
be scheming to erect a ball yard the size of a small planet in the
heart of the city?</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, why wasn't Hahn at the meeting instead of
waiting for a courtesy call?</TE>
<TE>   Well, Hahn told me, he's very much interested in transforming
downtown into a vibrant, neighborhoody place, and if a football
stadium helps, he's in favor.</TE>
<TE>   He's not sure how a stadium that sits empty 340 days a year would
accomplish that, and he's not sure there's a way to move the Dodgers
to a downtown stadium, which would at least mean more play dates.</TE>
<TE>   But all this stadium talk is very preliminary, Hahn said. And
since he doesn't intend to put up any public money to build one, he's
just sitting back, waiting for the principals to drop a proposal in
front of him.</TE>
<TE>   Where do I begin?</TE>
<TE>   No. 1, you don't build a stadium in a redevelopment area without
some public cost for land acquisition or road improvements and the
like.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2, the kind of leader this city needs wouldn't be sitting on
his hands, waiting for the phone to ring. He'd be telling developers
the way it's going to be, rather than vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   I see no alternative but to corner Phil Anschutz myself, and make
sure we don't get fleeced, like so many other cities have been by
rich sports moguls.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the best efforts of our City Hall gang, Phil, this is not
a town of pushovers.</TE>
<TE>   And just because you rode in here on a horse and built Staples
Center, it ain't your city to make or remake.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Anschutz, call me immediately.</TE>
<TE>   That's 1-800-LATIMES.</TE>

<HD>Moms Get Treated to Mariachi Festival for Their Special Day</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Santa Ana Stadium event draws thousands who want
to make mothers happy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventy-five-year-old Hortense Flores thought her family was taking
her out Saturday for the traditional Mother's Day dinner at her
favorite Santa Ana restaurant. That would have been nice enough, she
said.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they drove her to a big mariachi-fest, which was strange
to her because her Americanized children usually turned the radio off
or changed the station when she played traditional Mexican music.</LD>
<LD>   "I was shocked. They're taking me to the mariachis? Excuse me?"
said Flores from her bleacher seat at Santa Ana Stadium. "It seems to
me they're going to be bored to death!"</LD>
<TE>   "I'm sure we're all going to enjoy it," said son Robert, 43, as
the first music played.</TE>
<TE>   Las mananitas--that traditional Mexican morning serenade to
mothers--became las nochesitas, as thousands of people treated their
moms Saturday night to a festival of mariachi music in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 people, most accompanied by mothers, jammed Santa Ana
Stadium for the Festival de Mariachis, which began with a blessing
from Archbishop Jaime Soto. There was singing, horseback-riding,
roping and dancing.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, as simple as they come: Make mom happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I would cry if she didn't show up," said Belem Solis, a Santa Ana
Parks and Recreation volunteer coordinator, and the person charged
with spearheading the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Her motivation was pleasing her 79-year-old mother, Maria
Consuelo. "I told her, 'Mommy, you've got to go.' She's like a
princess. She is literally the reina of my family."</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly for Santa Ana, a city with a large Latino immigrant
population, the festival fell between Mother's Day in Mexico and
Mother's Day in the U.S., celebrated today. That's Santa Ana in a
nutshell--equal parts America and Mexico, with all the good and
not-so-good that come from such a dichotomy.</TE>
<TE>   For some children, it meant minor sacrifices as they listened to
music they're not attuned to.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really like this kind of music," said 12-year-old Jessica
Lopez as she listened to the group Perla Tapatia with her sister
Nancy, 16, and little brother Lalo, 7.</TE>
<TE>   But her mother, Maria Inez Lopez, 44, a gregarious woman, deserved
being honored, she said. "I like her because she makes us laugh.
She's nice and joyful."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Inez Lopez was busily working, donating roses and
greeting people--when she wasn't bringing plates of hot dogs or tacos
to her seated children--she clearly had a blast.</TE>
<TE>   From one of the tunnels, the mother and several other volunteers
could be heard screaming "ajuaa!" and assorted other mariachi yelps.
They grabbed male volunteers, and arms interlocked, danced with
abandon. They sang along and swayed underneath the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really having a good time," said Stephanie Ramirez, 13, who
volunteered alongside her mother, Mariela.</TE>
<TE>   Never had the city embarked on such a Mother's Day celebration,
city officials and residents said. The event was about eight months
in the making, and during that time it consumed many city officials,
staff, business people, students and other volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   High school students, senior citizens and numerous other residents
scoured the city, leaving fliers and posters for the event at
churches, businesses, tienditas--small stores--beauty salons, banks,
restaurants and in front of the zoo. Volunteers took scads of tickets
to sell throughout Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something a city decided to do for our mothers," said
Otto Bade, 56, owner of La Perla Restaurant on Main Street. "This is
a way to teach our children to love and respect their mothers."</TE>

<HD>Mothers Call for End to Violence</HD>
<DH>South-Central: Women whose children were slain march
through neighborhoods as part of effort to turn their anger and pain
in a positive direction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day many spent searching for the perfect Mother's Day gift, a
group of about 40 mothers in South-Central Los Angeles marched
through their neighborhoods calling for an end to the violence that
has claimed so many of their children.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing T-shirts imprinted with photos of their deceased sons and
daughters and holding graduation pictures of children now buried, the
women marched through several neighborhoods to Harvard Park, chanting
"Save our children! Save our children!"</LD>
<LD>   The march is part of an effort by Charlotte Austin-Jordan, who has
lost two children to gang gunfire, to encourage mothers like herself
to become more involved in combating violence in their neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   With support from the 77th Street Community Police Station,
Austin-Jordan wants mothers to begin talking to young people in their
neighborhoods about the pain that engulfs a family when a relative is
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, 48 people have been killed in the 77th Street
division, where Harvard Park is located. Austin-Jordan hopes
one-on-one contact with the youths will make an impression.</TE>
<TE>   "Gangbangers have mothers too," she said. "We've tried having
fathers talk to them, police talking to them, other gangbangers
talking to them. We've never tried to get mothers to talk to them."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department, too, is searching for
solutions, hoping to focus the anger and pain of mothers who have
lost children in a positive direction.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. James Miller said the division will begin looking for
ways to support the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditional law enforcement just isn't having an impact," said
Miller, who during his 25 years on the force has lost four fellow
officers in gang shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more arrests, we're sending more people to jail, and the
killings keep going up. We have to find another way to reach gang
members," Miller added.</TE>
<TE>   One of the women who marched Saturday was Lanalgree Richard, whose
21-year-old son, John Edward Munson IV, was killed Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "He was at a stoplight in his car with a friend from North
Carolina," Richard said. "A guy walking by pulled out a gun and
started shooting. Every bullet he shot hit my son."</TE>
<TE>   Another participant, Sharon Brown, said her 13-year-old son,
Marquese Prude, was tutoring students at St. Andrews Recreation
Center on Nov. 28 when two young men came in shooting, hitting him in
the head and neck.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an honor student," Brown said. "He played every sport and
still got straight A's. He did what he was told."</TE>
<TE>   Ericka Bonilla's fiance, Manuel Rivas, 27, was at his job in a
pawnshop at the intersection of Vernon and Vermont avenues the
morning of Jan. 12 when a gunman got out of a car, then shot and
killed him.</TE>

<HD>Rapes May Be Linked</HD>
<DH>Crime: Attacks on older women in Los Alamitos resemble
those that plagued Belmont Shore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are trying to determine whether a man who attacked two older
women Saturday in a Los Alamitos mobile home park is the elusive
"Belmont Shore rapist," who has struck at least six times in
neighboring Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The attacker entered the home of his first victim shortly before
1:20 a.m. and raped a 71-year-old woman who had been alone and asleep
with her front door unlocked in the Royal Oak Mobile Home Park,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   An hour later, a man believed to be the same assailant assaulted a
68-year-old woman who lives just a short walk from where detectives
were investigating the first attack. Again, the man entered through
an unlocked door and attacked the woman but in this case did not rape
her, police said. She suffered minor physical injuries and was
treated at a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   The attacker fled after stealing the second victim's car, a beige
1987 Honda Accord, license plate 2DWF746. As of Saturday evening,
police had not found the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The assaults bear striking similarities to half a dozen rapes that
alarmed residents in and around the upscale Belmont Shore area of
Long Beach from 1997 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the Long Beach rapes, older women were targeted late at night
as they slept alone with doors or windows unlocked. Detectives linked
the six rapes to a seventh attack in Huntington Beach about the same
time. Victims described the attacker as a slender white man, 5-foot-9
to 5-foot-11 and 25 to 35 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, after a nearly three-year hiatus, a similar string of
attacks began. Since April 6, three more women, ages 54 to 74, have
been sexually assaulted in their Long Beach homes late at night.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach police said Saturday that they will probably examine
the Los Alamitos attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds like the same M.O.," said Long Beach police
spokeswoman Nancy Tabing, "but whether or not they are related
remains to be seen."</TE>

<LD>State health officials warned people not to eat crabs, sardines,
anchovies and bivalves such as clams and oysters caught for sport
along the coastline of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties.</LD>
<LD>   Testing has revealed elevated levels in those species of a toxin
called domoic acid, said Lea Brooks, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Health Services.</LD>
<LD>   Though no one in California has been confirmed as becoming ill
from the poison, the symptoms of a mild case mimic those of the flu,
health specialists say. In severe cases, people may become
disoriented, experience seizures and even die.</LD>
<TE>   Domoic acid is produced by sea algae. Scientists do not know why
production increases from time to time.</TE>

<HD>Running, Walking to Battle Cancer</HD>
<DH>Event: About 60,000 participate in Revlon's ninth annual
fund-raiser aimed at breast and ovarian disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Frances Small, the early Saturday morning wake-up, the long drive
and the traffic snarls were minor irritations on the way to her
destination: the Los Angeles Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, she was focused on the battle her sister is waging
against breast cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The Palmdale resident was one of 60,000 people who cheerfully put
up with logistical hassles--including hourlong waits to enter parking
lots and lines for everything from T-shirts to portable toilets--for
a chance to run or walk in support of the fight against breast and
ovarian cancer.</LD>
<TE>   The participants in the ninth annual Revlon Run/Walk--more than
twice the number of runners as at this year's Los Angeles
Marathon--raised almost $3.5 million for research, awareness and
prevention programs.</TE>
<TE>   By 8 a.m., Small, a client service representative for a clinical
trials company, was standing outside the Coliseum, wearing a
five-digit race number on her chest and a white-and-red card on her
back that told others she was walking in support of her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "She's doing well," Small said. "But I am here supporting the
cause, for all the women."</TE>
<TE>   Small's friend, Joanne Gardner-Smith, said she has made the event,
which is put on by the Entertainment Industry Foundation, a part of
her Mother's Day weekend for the last six years. This year, she
raised $230 "without any effort."</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in being proactive rather than reactive," Gardner-Smith
said. "It's humbling to see how breast cancer has touched so many
people ....One year, we just stood out here and cried. Some people
wore two and three cards."</TE>
<TE>   The cards--purple for cancer survivors, red for their relatives
and yellow for those marching in memory of someone--allowed
participants to give names to the reasons why they were walking. Some
listed three or four generations in a family, seeming to reflect a
hereditary predisposition to the diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Participant Kristy Adams, 45, walked in memory of her mother, who
died of ovarian cancer 13 years ago. Last year, Adams' first at the
event, she was touched by a man "walking in memory of five family
members. And he was all alone." This year, she brought her son, two
daughters and office mates to walk beside her.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans of the event have refined participation in the Run/Walk
almost to a science. They keep in touch with friends via cell phone,
assign prearranged meeting spots on the grounds of the Coliseum, and
forgo handouts from sponsors, thus avoiding trips back to the car to
stash race paraphernalia.</TE>
<TE>   "After you've done it a lot of years, you realize you don't need
the free stuff," said Madeline Mozee of San Bernardino. "Waiting in
line doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Mozee had avoided an early wake-up call by booking a downtown
hotel room for herself and friend Evi Roberson, an 11-year breast
cancer survivor.</TE>
<TE>   Event organizer Lisa Paulsen, president of the Entertainment
Industry Foundation, said clinical trials of the breast
cancer-fighting drug Herceptin were fast-tracked because of money
raised at the run/walks.</TE>
<TE>   As Paulsen darted around the hospitality tent near the finish
line, greeting celebrities and supporters, she marveled aloud at the
longevity of the event. After nine years, she said, the Revlon
Run/Walk has become an annual reunion of sorts for the participants,
as well as the 2,500 volunteers who keep the event running.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep thinking that participation in the event will wane," she
said. "But it never does."</TE>

<HD>David Riesman Jr., 92; Sociologist Coauthored 'The Lonely
Crowd'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Riesman Jr., attorney and sociologist who rocketed to fame with
the publication of his first book, "The Lonely Crowd," which remains
a classic study of ever-changing American society, has died. He was
92.</LD>
<LD>   Riesman died Friday in a nursing home in Binghamton, N.Y., of
natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Coauthored by Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney, Riesman's 1950 "The
Lonely Crowd: A Study of the Changing American Character" has sold
more than 1.4 million copies. The book popularized and dignified the
field of sociology and helped set the stage for developing "pop
psychology."</LD>
<TE>   Along with such cautionary tomes as "The Greening of America,"
"One-Dimensional Man" and "The Status Seekers," the book also
signaled a long period of intense self-scrutiny by Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Even people who never read Riesman's masterwork came to identify
friends and neighbors as "inner-directed," "other-directed" or
perhaps "tradition-directed"--three terms Riesman coined for
household as well as classroom consumption.</TE>
<TE>   In the book, Riesman defined three types of social character as
determined by population trends. In periods with fairly stable
population growth such as the Middle Ages, he said, people become
"tradition-directed," planning their lives according to the rules of
their cultural history.</TE>
<TE>   As populations grow, he said, people become "inner-directed,"
ambitiously setting and pursuing individualistic goals such as fame
or scientific discovery.</TE>
<TE>   But as populations stabilize anew following growth spurts,
individuals become "other-directed," seeking peer approval by
conforming to group aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   The third type was how Riesman viewed the mid-20th-century
Americans he was writing about.</TE>
<TE>   As a companion piece, Riesman and Glazer wrote a second book,
published in 1952, titled "Faces in the Crowd: Individual Studies in
Character and Politics," to illustrate the various types of
character.</TE>
<TE>   Many saw the books as preaching nonconformity, and flower children
and other individualists sought to use them as a basis to justify
free-form lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   A reference to "The Lonely Crowd" even pops up in Bob Dylan's song
"I Shall Be Released," which includes the lyric "Standing next to me
in this lonely crowd is a man who swears he's not to blame."</TE>
<TE>   But Riesman emphasized that personalities are too complex for a
single label and insisted he merely wanted to show how conformity
could occur and be enforced in society.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also felt Riesman meant to discredit careers in business,
as corporations began to rely on group decisions rather than
individual action. He disputed that, writing in a 1969 edition that
he regretted how "The Lonely Crowd" might have encouraged snobbish
deprecation of business careers. He pointed out that he had
repeatedly encouraged "interested students to take their MBAs."</TE>
<TE>   Adamantly opposed to nuclear weapons and to war, and specifically
the Vietnam War, Riesman nevertheless famously opposed student
protesters of the 1960s. He referred to their activities at UC
Berkeley and other campuses as "uncivil disobedience," and told
Berkeley student leaders their conduct was provoking a right-wing
backlash that would "one day elect [then-Gov.] Ronald Reagan
president."</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Riesman staunchly continued to oppose subsequent
and milder student protests over South African apartheid and other
issues. College, he insisted, should be a time "for students to do
things badly, to be awkward, to think about utopian subjects, to read
Baudelaire.... Politics can come later."</TE>
<TE>   Riesman devoted much of his study and writing to higher
education--contributing half a dozen books on such issues as rising
student power, declining faculty autonomy, politics in choosing
administrators and treatment of minorities on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Among the books he wrote or co-wrote were "The Academic
Revolution" in 1968, "The Perpetual Dream: Reform and Experiment in
the American College" in 1978, "On Higher Education: The Academic
Enterprise in an Era of Rising Student Consumerism" in 1980 and
"Choosing a College President: Opportunities and Constraints" in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Riesman, who through the years enjoyed matching wits with
journalists as much as students, academics and government officials,
was often sought out for commentary on evolving America.</TE>
<TE>   During the high inflation, oil shortages and economic curtailment
of the 1970s, he once defined inflation for a Times columnist as
"social dynamite," and warned of "the enormous resistance of people
to the lowering of standards of living...."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Philadelphia, the son of a physician and professor of
medicine, Riesman earned a bachelor's degree in biomedical science
and a law degree from Harvard, serving as editor of the Harvard
Crimson and an editor of the Harvard Law Review.</TE>
<TE>   He was a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis,
practiced law in Boston and taught it at the University of Buffalo.
He then worked as a deputy assistant district attorney in Manhattan.
During World War II, he was an executive at Sperry Gyroscope Co.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately Riesman decided to concentrate on an academic
career in lecturing, research and writing. He taught social sciences
at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1958 and then at Harvard
until semiretirement in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1998 after 62 years of marriage to Evelyn Hastings
Thompson, Riesman is survived by two daughters, Lucy Lowenstein and
Jennie Riesman; one son, Michael; and two grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The brother of Robert Blake's slain wife has been charged with grand
theft and identity theft, delaying his extradition to Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph E. Bakley, 36, pleaded innocent to the charges Friday in
Superior Court and was ordered held without bail. The counts
apparently stem from his years of living in San Diego under several
aliases.</LD>
<LD>   Bakley was wanted by the Florida Department of Corrections for a
parole violation stemming from a 1992 conviction for cocaine
possession and grand theft auto.</LD>
<TE>   He was arrested by members of a fugitive task force last week
after he appeared on national television discussing the high-profile
killing of his sister, Bonny Lee Bakley. He waived his right to
extradition.</TE>
<TE>   Blake has pleaded innocent to charges that he shot his wife to
death May 4, 2001, near a Studio City restaurant.</TE>

<HD>Homeless Shelter Takes Root at Base</HD>
<DH>Housing: Tustin complex, which includes job-training
facilities, will be among largest in U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The closed Tustin Marine base was reincarnated Saturday when ground
was broken for a homeless shelter, the first redevelopment project at
the former military facility.</LD>
<LD>   "This has been a long, long road," Tustin Mayor Jeffery M. Thomas
told about 200 people gathered for the ceremony. "It has taken a lot
of time and a lot of patience."</LD>
<LD>   The occasion was a milestone in the saga of Orange County's two
closed military bases whose reuse plans have sparked controversy.</LD>
<TE>   Plans for a commercial airport at the former El Toro base appear
to be dead, though the dispute still lingers as proponents of the
airport take their fight to the courts.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,600-acre base in Tustin also faced an uncertain future until
Thursday when the city of Tustin, which is in charge of redeveloping
the base, and the Santa Ana Unified School District announced they
had reached a settlement in their eight-year battle over a chunk of
the base.</TE>
<TE>   Both bases were slated for closure in the early 1990s, but
officially closed their doors in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The quarrel over the Tustin base threatened its redevelopment
because a state law passed last year prohibited Tustin from approving
projects until the matter with the school district was resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The law exempted the homeless shelter, but stood in the way of
Tustin's plan to allow construction of homes, businesses and a golf
course at the site.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Navy is to turn over deeds to the land Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't get any better than this," an ebullient Thomas said.
"Now, it is kind of a fun climate moving on to Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   The mood was decidedly cheerful for backers of the homeless
shelter too. The five-acre complex will house 192 men, women and
children and include medical and educational facilities. Two barracks
will be remodeled and a new facility constructed.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin will lease the land at no cost to Orange County Rescue
Mission, a faith-based agency which will run the shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The work is expected to take about two years and when completed,
the shelter will be one of the largest facilities of its kind in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we are actually going to make this thing happen," said
Rescue Mission President Jim Palmer, before hopping on a skip loader
and tearing out a slab of asphalt in the parking lot to make way for
the shelter's job-training and medical facilities.</TE>
<TE>   For the Rescue Mission, it was a homecoming of sorts. The founder
of the nonprofit, Lewis Whitehead, was a Marine sergeant at the
Tustin base who began feeding the area's homeless 38 years ago with
leftover food from the mess halls.</TE>
<TE>   "It is incredible," Palmer said. "He used to walk across this very
site. This brings us full circle."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Col. William L. Hammerle also completed a circle Saturday.
He was base commander from 1993 until 1996, when he retired and
settled in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, while watching his former home take on a new life,
Hammerle pointed to the base's old chapel, just beyond the spot where
the homeless shelter will sit.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of young Marines get married there, also memorial
services," he said. "That place captured the smiles and tears of this
place."</TE>

<HD>Paper Tear-Up Snafu Hits INS Facility</HD>
<DH>Immigration: An agency contractor in O.C. may have shredded
live documents, possibly destroying many applicants' paperwork.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service is investigating
allegations that documents mailed to the agency's massive processing
center in Orange County may have been improperly shredded by a
database contractor working for the INS.</LD>
<LD>   The agency has suspended all shredding at its Laguna Niguel
service center and is expanding telephone-inquiry services to field
calls from people from California and three other Western states who
fear that applications for political asylum and other paperwork may
have been destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   "We are taking this matter very, very seriously," said Virginia
Kice, a spokeswoman for the INS regional headquarters. "The kind of
work that's being done at this service center certainly affects tens
of thousands of people."</LD>
<TE>   The INS is also planning to ask some applicants whose paperwork
may have vanished to send another set of documents. The agency said
it will work with attorneys and immigrant advocates to help
reconstruct people's files if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The INS spokeswoman stressed that no definitive proof of illegal
destruction of government property or potential motive had been
discovered, or how many documents have been affected. The service
center in Laguna Niguel--one of four such INS facilities
nationwide--routinely and properly shreds considerable paperwork
after it has been processed.</TE>
<TE>   The shredding incident is the second occasion in the last two
months that the work of private INS contractors, hired in recent
years to improve efficiency, has been questioned. In March, an INS
contract facility in Kentucky mailed visa approvals to two of the 19
Middle Eastern hijackers who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
unleashing criticism from the White House, Congress and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The INS has been harshly assailed since Sept. 11. Congress is
poised to abolish the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Niguel service center is the initial entry point to the
INS bureaucracy for multitudes of applicants from California,
Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii. Each week, the office is the recipient of
an average of 60,000 pieces of mail, including a wide array of
completed INS forms, among them applications for political asylum,
citizenship, visa extensions, work permits and petitions for
relatives to immigrate to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The mailings often include detailed affidavits and other crucial
papers documenting petitioners' claims. Asylum applications may run
to hundreds of pages, encompassing character references and other
documentation. Lawyers know not to send originals, but many
individuals do not.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have tried to centralize paperwork at the
service centers in recent years to help improve efficiency at an
agency already notorious for losing files, outdated technology and a
backlog that has reached about 5 million applications nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of contract operations at Laguna Niguel was
launched by the INS' Office of Internal Audit last month when two
agency employees relayed suspicions of improper shredding. One
knowledgeable source said the INS officials recovered about 90,000
pieces of mail apparently destined for the shredder. Another source
said several private contract employees had come forward with reports
of questionable shredding, and that one worker had been placed on
administrative leave with pay.</TE>
<TE>   The INS inquiry is focusing on the activities of Datatrac
Information Services, a Texas-based firm employed in Laguna Niguel,
Kice said. A company spokesman who declined to give his name said the
firm's contract with the government prohibited speaking to the media
about its work.</TE>
<TE>   Datatrac and a second company, SEI Technology Inc., based in
Virginia, are both working as subcontractors to a third firm, JHM
Research &amp; Development of Maryland. The INS awarded JHM a
$325-million contract in January 2001 to staff the nation's four
regional immigration service centers.</TE>
<TE>   John Macklin, president of JHM, declined to comment about the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At the service facilities, all three firms have been collaborating
in an effort to help modernize the INS' antiquated records regimen
and manage the blizzard of paperwork that arrives each day. Among the
1,550 employees at the Laguna Niguel facility, between 500 and 700
are contract staffers assisting with data management.</TE>
<TE>   The contracted data processors typically open mail, enter details
into the agency's computer system, forward pertinent documents to
appropriate INS offices and process enclosed checks, which can range
from about $50 to more than $2,000 per applicant. Nonessential
paperwork is designated for the shredder.</TE>
<TE>   The three private firms took over in Laguna Niguel in July after
resolution of a legal dispute involving the former contractor, said
one knowledgeable person who asked not to be named. Confronting the
new contractors were substantial backlogs of mail, which workers have
been trying to reduce ever since, according to the person's account.</TE>
<TE>   Some immigration attorneys who file frequently in Laguna Niguel
say they have noticed longer delays in hearing back from the agency
in recent months, but assumed that was another sign of an overwhelmed
INS.</TE>
<TE>   "I frankly figured the agency has so many applications, it was
just buried," said Carl Shusterman, a private immigration lawyer in
Los Angeles and former INS staff attorney. "But this [the alleged
shredding] shows there's some major flaws in the contracting system
that's being used."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the ongoing investigation, the INS says it will be
prepared to handle additional telephone inquiries starting Monday
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at its Laguna Niguel offices, (949) 831-8427.
Petitioners who have not received a receipt from the INS for
applications sent to the service center within the last 30 days can
call and check.</TE>

<HD>State Plans Offensive in Sprawl War</HD>
<DH>Land use: Gov. Davis backs bill linking grants to efforts
to steer growth to developed areas. Cities fear loss of local
control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once at the forefront of the so-called smart-growth movement,
California has been sitting on the sidelines for years, thanks to a
state planning agency that has no control over local land-use
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Gov. Gray Davis is supporting a bill that could propel the
state back into the thick of the sprawl war. If passed, the proposal
would link state grants to cities to their ability to plan wisely.</LD>
<LD>   Many builders and city officials are resisting, calling the move
an affront to local rule.</LD>
<TE>   If passed, the plan would call for communities that abide by a set
of growth principles, drafted by the governor's Office of Planning
and Research, to get preference for certain funds. Those principles
would channel growth into areas that are already developed and away
from open land on the outer edges of suburbia.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of top-down approach that has been used in
controversial efforts to curb sprawl in other states.</TE>
<TE>   "We are attempting to create a carrot, an incentive for cities to
adopt model planning practices," said state Sen. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica), author of the bill, SB 1521.</TE>
<TE>   Planners call it a baby step compared with more radical policies
enacted in Oregon and Maryland, but the bill has triggered fierce
opposition from local government and real estate lobbyists. Some
planners complain that those groups have already managed to poke
loopholes in the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The debate highlights the political pitfalls inherent in attempts
by state agencies to manage California's explosive growth. It has
been such a controversial issue, in fact, that this is the first time
the Office of Planning and Research has sponsored a piece of
legislation in nearly 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "In Maryland, cities can't get state money to build a school if
they do it in the middle of an agricultural conservation area," said
William Fulton, an urban planner and author of books about sprawl in
California. "In California they can, and frequently do.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the planning world wishes the state would start
using its money to reward good planning."</TE>
<TE>   The bill has yet to define what the planning principles would be,
but state officials say they would encourage open space preservation,
development near public transportation and neighborhoods designed for
walking. Clustered homes in densely populated areas would be favored
over low-density developments on the urban fringe.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, cities put together their land-use plan with little
oversight," said Scott Bollens, chairman of urban and regional
planning at UC Irvine. "The state makes sure they do it, but there is
no substantial review."</TE>
<TE>   That would all change under SB 1521. Yet the bill stops well short
of extreme measures like the state-mandated urban growth boundaries
of Portland, Ore., where development is off limits in a ring around
the city. The idea is to stop sprawl by containing growth to the
already-urbanized area.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to help steer the planning process, but we don't want to
row the boat," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio, who acknowledged
that the state has fallen behind in the smart-growth movement.
California "doesn't have the reputation of being aggressive in
assisting communities to plan smarter," he said. "I think this
proposal is significant."</TE>
<TE>   Many local officials are not eager for the assistance. They are
particularly wary of any effort by the state to change funding
formulas. The animosity is rooted in the early 1990s, when the state
took a large chunk of property tax revenue away from cities and
directed it to school districts. The state never made up the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities just don't trust any changes the state makes--even those
that would help them," Fulton said. "They feel mowed down."</TE>
<TE>   The bill initially called for a model zoning ordinance for cities
to enact in order to get preference for the state grants. That
approach was abandoned in favor of a set of principles that
communities would be encouraged to adopt. Foes say it still boils
down to the state trying to force local land-use decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe those kinds of decisions should be left to the
locals," said Alex Creel, the California Assn. of Realtors' vice
president for government affairs. "Trying to apply the same formula
to diverse parts of the state does not seem like a good way to plan
development. San Diego is a lot different than Eureka."</TE>
<TE>   The League of California Cities worried that the principles would
be too rigid and successfully lobbied to make them more flexible.</TE>
<TE>   "If the state wants to recognize local government planning
practices, fine," said Dan Carrigg, legislative representative for
the league. "We just want it to do so in a way that cities don't feel
their authority is being taken away."</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the proposed law dovetails with consideration of a
similar measure in Congress. The Community Character Act, approved by
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last month, would
offer financial incentives for states to base their land-use strategy
on a model drafted by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The American Planning Assn. supports the bill, arguing that
planning policies for nearly half of the states are outdated.</TE>
<TE>   Homebuilders have criticized the act as inviting inappropriate
interference by the federal government into state affairs. The Bush
administration has joined the National Assn. of Homebuilders in
opposing the act and voiced its opinion to the group in a strongly
worded letter written by Mel Martinez, secretary of Housing and Urban
Development.</TE>
<TE>   "The standardization of land-use planning would begin to define
what constitutes 'good' growth management decisions," he wrote. "The
problem is, of course, that what would be 'good' for one community
could be 'bad' for another."</TE>

<HD>Submarines' Secret History Surfaces</HD>
<DH>Navy: Some of the most important U.S. weapons of the Cold
War were developed at Point Mugu, but the stories of the crews and
systems remain largely untold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was 1963 and the U.S. submarine Growler lay silent and deep
beneath the black waters of the North Pacific, trying desperately to
remain invisible as a Soviet sub prowled nearby.</LD>
<LD>   No one made a sound in the cramped confines of the American
vessel. An errant rattle or ping could tip off the Soviets, who could
send the Growler, its 100 crew members and four nuclear missiles to
the bottom of the sea.</LD>
<LD>   "Khrushchev had vowed to sink us if he found us," recalled Robert
Harmuth of Oxnard, who was aboard the Growler, one of America's first
nuclear-armed submarines. "The sub tracked us for 30 minutes, but we
don't think he knew what he had on his hands."</LD>
<TE>   The Growler, which was just 500 miles off the Kamchatka Peninsula
on the far eastern coast of the Soviet Union, dove deep, went under
the Soviet sub and escaped.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty hairy, we put our lives on the line every day,"
said Harmuth, 66. "It's been overlooked for years because everyone
was so hush-hush about the program."</TE>
<TE>   The history of America's first nuclear-armed submarines and the
missiles they carried remains largely untold.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons, tested and developed chiefly at Point Mugu in Ventura
County, were among the most secret projects of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Using World War II German missile technology, more than a dozen
ex-Nazi scientists and a small army of dedicated pilots and
submariners, the military devised a primitive but effective sea-based
nuclear deterrent that kept the Soviets off balance for years.</TE>
<TE>   Black-and-white pictures of the German scientists still adorn the
office wall of Max White, former pilot and base historian at Point
Mugu.</TE>
<TE>   There is Theodor Sterm, Wilfried Hell and Herbert Wagner. The
latter designed a missile that sunk an American ship during World War
II, killing 2,000 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Wagner was actually a very sweet man," said White, 86. "My wife
was his secretary."</TE>
<TE>   There were accidents and close calls. Missiles exploded on launch
pads, planes crashed at test sites on the Channel Islands and
submarines cruising close to the Soviet coast were chased by enemy
ships or entangled in fishing nets.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everything we did was classified, how everything worked
was classified," said 68-year-old Al Thayer of Camarillo, a former
fighter pilot assigned to the Regulus program in 1955. "I went at it
tooth and nail for seven years. Our tests were trying to prove a
submarine could control nuclear weapons to their target and stay
submerged."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the underwater-launched Polaris missiles that would follow,
the Regulus was a subsonic nuclear cruise missile. It was fired from
the decks of ships and submarines, then steered by remote control.
The first successful flight was in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   Their limited range meant submarines had to be within 500 miles of
the target. Many submariners doubted they would survive long after
the first launch because of their exposure on the surface for the 15
minutes it took to fire the missile.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't like to think about it, but we knew we were toast,"
Harmuth said. "It would have only taken minutes for them to be on top
of us."</TE>
<TE>   The prospective targets were coastal Soviet navy and submarine
bases. Though lacking pinpoint accuracy, the missiles' nuclear
payload meant they could vaporize installations even if they were a
few miles off course.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people in the Navy who realized that if you put an
atomic weapon on a submarine, you would have the Cold War's ultimate
weapon. If you could do that, your opponent would fear making a first
strike against you," said Nick Spark, who recently finished a
documentary entitled "Regulus: The First Nuclear Missile Submarines."</TE>
<TE>   Spark said the five Regulus submarine crews have been almost
totally forgotten. "From 1958 to 1964, these subs patrolled off the
coast of the Soviet Union," he said. "During the Cuban Missile
Crisis, they sat off the Soviet coast on full alert."</TE>
<TE>   He said talking to Regulus alumni was like uncorking a champagne
bottle.</TE>
<TE>   "Many said they couldn't wait to get the film in the mail so they
could finally tell their kids what they had done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Regulus there was the Loon, an updated copy of the German
V-1 rocket lobbed at England during World War II. The first Loon was
fired in 1946 from a beach at Point Mugu and crashed just a mile
offshore.</TE>
<TE>   "In the time I was there, we discovered a new guidance system
based on radar," said Pat Murphy, 82, a former sub commander from
Santa Barbara who helped direct the Loon project. "Then the Regulus
came along, which was a pilotless aircraft that flew at 30,000 feet
with a range of 400 or so miles."</TE>
<TE>   To minimize expenses, the 33-foot Regulus missile could be landed
and reused. Pilots flying beside it would land it via remote control
on San Nicolas Island or Edwards Air Force Base.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to keep visual contact at all times, even in the clouds,"
Thayer said. "It was extremely difficult, but when it was operating
correctly it was the smoothest thing going. It would go from zero to
240 mph in two seconds."</TE>
<TE>   While Thayer flew overhead, life in the submarines below was
claustrophobic, hot and dirty.</TE>
<TE>   Harmuth, who wrote a book about life on the Regulus submarines,
said it wasn't uncommon to go seven weeks without a shower. Patrols,
often in rough seas, lasted up to four months and the crew couldn't
even see the missiles take off.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't watch a launch from the submarine because the
boosters would suck all the air out of the area and you would
suffocate," Harmuth said. "You'd hear this giant 'swoosh.' It was
like being in a hot sauna, you'd be drenched in sweat."</TE>
<TE>   The Regulus patrols ended in 1964, replaced by subs that carried
16 Polaris missiles with multiple nuclear warheads. It was a quantum
leap in technology, solid-state electronics trumping vacuum tubes.</TE>
<TE>   David Stumpf, author of "Regulus: The Forgotten Weapon," said the
missile laid the groundwork for today's Tomahawk cruise missiles and
modern submarines.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so glad these guys were alive and could do what they did,"
he said. "I would like to think I had that kind of right stuff.
Everyone I talked to was extremely proud of what they did and I have
no doubt they would have taken a missile to the target if ordered to
do so."</TE>

<HD>A Student's Essay Led Him to Jail</HD>
<DH>Attacks: After Sept. 11, it became evidence, putting his
teacher in a tough spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA MESA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It was just an end-of-summer essay, a traditional assignment teacher
Mimi Pollack uses to break the ice with a new group of students
learning English at Grossmont Community College.</LD>
<LD>   But what Pollack read in one of her students' blue books last fall
helped put him behind bars for three months. And it turned the
liberal instructor into an uneasy accomplice in the nation's
terrorist dragnet.</LD>
<LD>   Only recently has the teacher felt that her world has returned to
equilibrium. The young man she reported to the FBI eight months
earlier is back in class. And her efforts had helped set him free.</LD>
<TE>   Osama Awadallah, 22, said he has forgiven the teacher he calls
"Mimi" and the two have resumed their friendship. Just one thing,
Awadallah cajoles her with a smile: Please, don't turn any more
school work over to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   It began Sept. 13, when Pollack assigned her English grammar class
to write about what they had done and whom they had met since moving
to San Diego. The assignment came just two days after the terrorist
attacks on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask the same question--same assignment--in that class every
semester," said Pollack, an English as a second language instructor.</TE>
<TE>   The essays, written in blue exam books, were turned in after
class. Pollack took the papers to her La Mesa home, dropped them on a
chair in the living room and got around to grading them more than a
week later.</TE>
<TE>   Pollack, 48, remembers wading through the stack of compositions
before she grabbed Awadallah's. The Jordanian immigrant has been in
three of Pollack's classes, and they had become friends, she a Jew
and he a devout Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few paragraphs into the neatly written essay, a single line
stopped Pollack. Awadallah had written: "One [sic] of the quietest
people I have ever met is Nawaf and Khalid."</TE>
<TE>   Nawaf and Khalid. Pollack knew those names.</TE>
<TE>   The identities of 19 people suspected in the Sept. 11 attacks had
been widely reported; Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almidhar were two of
the names on the list. They had lived for a time in San Diego and
nearby Lemon Grove. Now they were blamed for helping crash American
Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "I read it again: 'One of the quietest people I have ever met is
Nawaf and Khalid.' I was stunned," Pollack recalled, in her first
interview about her relationship with Awadallah. "Then I almost had a
heart attack. I'm sitting here reading this thinking, 'Why's he doing
this? Why's he writing about Nawaf and Khalid?'"</TE>
<TE>   Holding Awadallah's essay in her hands, Pollack's thoughts
swirled. Certainly, this student had never tried to temper, or hide,
his fundamentalist religious views.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very Muslim and in your face about it," Pollack said. "At
this point, nobody knew what was really going on. I began to wonder,
and worry."</TE>
<TE>   Pollack took the composition to the college vice president and
asked his advice. He told her to keep it. Agents were already
swarming the campus after they had found "Osama" scribbled on
paper--along with a phone number for Awadallah--in Alhazmi's 1988
Toyota Corolla. If they wanted the essay, they would ask for it, the
vice president said.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, Pollack was contacted by the FBI's San Diego office.
She told an agent about the composition, then drove to San Diego to
drop it off.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a matter of national security," she explained. "That's why
I gave it to them."</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Herself Had Diverse Background</TE>
<TE>   Pollack was certainly not one to flinch at those different from
herself. Born in Chicago, she spent 23 years of her youth in Mexico
City. She speaks fluent Spanish and also lived for a time in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   She wondered: Had she done the right thing? Had she betrayed her
profession? A student of Tibetan Buddhism, she looked to the
teachings of the Dalai Lama for answers. She decided that the path
she had chosen was the right one.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the "million questions" the FBI agents asked her were not
easy. She told them that Awadallah was a "very fundamentalist
Muslim," but also "a good kid and not capable of violence.... [I
said] he had a good heart."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had learned that Awadallah had worked briefly with
Alhazmi, the suspected hijacker, at a Texaco station in La Mesa.
Alhazmi's roommate was a fellow Saudi and suspected hijacker,
Almidhar.</TE>
<TE>   Pollack remained ambivalent about her student's predicament. On
the one hand, she recalled the brash student with clear misgivings
about the United States; the young man who played videotapes between
classes of atrocities allegedly committed against Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   But Awadallah was also the one who showed up in class Sept. 11,
badly shaken. "He came up to me after class and said what happened
was not the way of Islam," Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah was arrested on Sept. 20, one of three San Diego men
detained as material witnesses to the terrorist attacks. He was taken
to New York for questioning by federal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah may have been languishing in prison, but, via his
lawyer, he asked Pollack to send him his assignments. Prison
officials refused to allow the schoolwork inside; they cited national
security, said Randy Hamud, Awadallah's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Brought before a federal grand jury in New York, Awadallah
acknowledged knowing Nawaf Alhazmi, but not Khalid Almidhar. Then a
prosecutor confronted him with the essay he wrote for Pollack. With
Khalid's name written in the blue book, in his own hand, Awadallah
acknowledged he knew the man.</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah was indicted for perjury and released from federal
custody in New York in December after posting $500,000 bond. His
family and friends raised the bail money in cash and property,
including the title of an ice cream truck, to secure the bond. He
returned to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Pollack was preparing for a three-week, year-end trip to India to
study under the Dalai Lama, but before leaving, she wrote an
affidavit on Awadallah's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that nobody was showing support for Sam," Pollack said. "I
told the judge he was a good kid who was really serious about Islam.
Maybe too serious, but he was always helpful to the other students,
regardless of who they were."</TE>
<TE>   In February, Pollack wrote the court another letter on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "That gave me hope and a very good feeling," said Awadallah in a
telephone interview last week, monitored by his attorney, Hamud.
During an April 30 hearing for Awadallah, U.S. District Judge Shira
A. Scheindlin declared unconstitutional the Bush administration
practice of imprisoning material witnesses like Awadallah before
their grand jury appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Criticizing Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, Scheindlin added: "No
Congress has granted the government the authority to imprison an
innocent person in order to guarantee that he will testify before a
grand jury conducting a criminal investigation."</TE>
<TE>   The judge dismissed the perjury charge against Awadallah and
faulted the FBI for misrepresentations, saying it failed to note his
considerable cooperation and significant ties to the San Diego
community. She noted that the student had corrected his misstatement
and acknowledged he knew Almidhar.</TE>
<TE>   At least twice in court, the judge mentioned Pollack's statements
on behalf of her student.</TE>
<TE>   "Her support was very instrumental in his achieving credibility
with the judge," said Hamud, who immediately called Pollack with the
news that the case had been dropped. A short time later, Awadallah
walked into her class.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't know the case was dismissed," Pollack said. She
explained to him that the court proceedings meant that his legal
ordeal was over, at least for the time being. The government is
expected to appeal the judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Osama Awadallah dropped to his knees near the classroom doorway
and gave thanks to Allah.</TE>
<TE>   Months earlier, the two had doubts whether their friendship could
be repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Repairing a Friendship After Legal Ordeal</TE>
<TE>   When Pollack returned from India in January, a Bosnian classmate
arranged a meeting between teacher and student, who were both
apprehensive about seeing each other after Awadallah's incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah arrived at Pollack's campus office nervous. "I was more
concerned about what she thought about me," he recalled. "Did she
think I was a bad person? Did she think I did something horrible?"</TE>
<TE>   He asked, "How could you do that?" Pollack remembers. She
countered: Why did you have to write the words that put me in such a
bind?</TE>
<TE>   According to Pollack, Awadallah's answer was simple: "Well, I was
only answering the question you asked."</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah says now, "I have learned a lot about America and its
people." And the lesson is not nearly so bitter as one might suspect.
The young man plans to continue his studies, and to become a computer
engineer. He talked of plans to marry, to raise a family in his new
homeland and even to apply to become an American citizen.</TE>

<LD>No other city, it seems, has given rise to such a spiritual
smorgasbord of mystic, philosophical, occult, consciousness-raising,
therapeutic and alternative creeds--and just plain money-grubbing--as
20th century Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   For 100 years, the City of Angels has been a magnet for prophets
promising to unlock the secrets of the metaphysical and downright
odd, from eternal life to divine consciousness. From the Agabeg
Occult Church, whose priestess had violet hair, to Arthur Bell's
Mankind United, which promised followers new homes with swimming
pools, these movements found easy acceptance in a land populated by
waves of newcomers eager to rid themselves of past ties and embrace a
new California future.</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps none was quite so entertaining and greedy as the
self-proclaimed preacher Joe Jeffers, a huckster, jailbird and white
supremacist who turned a 32-room Laurel Canyon mansion into his own
Temple of Yahweh. During the 1930s and '40s, in their quest for
enlightenment, hundreds of soul-searching Angelenos put their faith
and their cash in Jeffers and, successively, each of his four
youthful wives.</LD>
<TE>   It was Hollywood--or at least Los Angeles--that catapulted the
Bible Belt preacher to fame. It wasn't his sin-smashing revivals,
false predictions, anti-Semitic preaching or even his alleged sexual
dalliances that brought his final fall from grace.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it was a lavish lifestyle--and fleecing his flock one
time too many to support it.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffers came to L.A. in the late 1930s, and he began his
evangelistic ministry with revival meetings at the Embassy Auditorium
downtown. Soon he opened his own church, the Kingdom Temple, at 8th
and Flower streets. He claimed that he heard the voices of Noah and
Jesus and that he wielded power over people's fates.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffers' charisma, his compelling line and piercing eyes soon
gathered a flock. He was part of what became known as the Christian
Identity Movement, whose adherents believe that white people are the
lost tribe of Israel and that Jews are half human and half satanic.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffers first made headlines in the late 1930s, when he began
mixing politics with religion. From the pulpit and by radio, he
roared condemnations of Catholics and Jews--especially those in
Hollywood--and threatened to expose the film industry for its wayward
behavior. In the same era, Father Coughlin, the "radio priest," was
delivering his anti-Semitic broadcasts nationwide and, a few years
later, anti-Semite Gerald L.K. Smith would try to get a permit to
speak in the auditorium of a local high school.</TE>
<TE>   All of that brought Jeffers new followers--and new attention from
authorities, who in March 1939 arrested him and his second wife,
Zella, on a morals charge in their Wilshire Boulevard high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney, Buron Fitts, said his office got wind of a
rumor that the couple intended to burn down their church for the
insurance money. On those grounds, the D.A. bugged their apartment
and hired an undercover cop to pose as a screenwriter to approach
them with the promise of putting Jeffers' life story on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   The ruse worked. On March 20, 1939, as the Jefferses threw a party
for themselves and the undercover cop posing as a screenwriter, the
undercover man shouted "Mahatma Gandhi!" as a signal for the police
holed up next door to kick down the door and raid the party. An
officer filmed the hectic scene, in which the Jefferses were clad
only in their birthday suits. Whether the undercover cop was in the
same state of undress, the D.A. didn't say.</TE>
<TE>   Headlines screamed of "orgies," and for four sensation-packed
weeks, more than 200 of what Jeffers said were 100,000 followers
appeared outside the Hall of Justice singing "Onward Christian
Soldiers" and waving small American flags. Inside, prosecutors
accused the couple of performing what were delicately described as
"exotic" and illegal sexual acts.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors painted a grim portrait of the couple, giving lurid
details of Zella allegedly indulging in sexual acts with another man
while her husband was intimately engaged with three other women. The
Jefferses bowed their heads and prayed.</TE>
<TE>   Zella's purported confession was read into the record: "I loved my
husband and wanted to keep working with him to win him away from his
peculiar ideas," she stated. But on the witness stand, the hysterical
Zella denied everything, including the confession. She and her
husband drank "drugged" champagne only because they were "induced" to
by the undercover cop who posed as their friend, she said. Ripping
off the court microphone, she screamed: "Oh, it's unfair! I'm not
getting a fair trial!"</TE>
<TE>   On the stand, Jeffers said he had been framed because of his
preaching "against the Communist Jews who are trying to get a war
with America." Later, he accused studio chiefs Harry and Jack Warner
of orchestrating it all; the executives denied it. (Two years later,
the undercover cop sued Warner Bros. for the $50,000 he said he
earned investigating the couple on behalf of the studio to prove
Jeffers was a Nazi spy. He lost the case, but during the trial, the
head of Warner Bros. security said he had rented the apartment next
door to the Jefferses' and bugged them.)</TE>
<TE>   Outside Judge Charles Fricke's courtroom, Jeffers' followers
quietly prayed, while scores of adherents and curiosity seekers
crammed into the courtroom to view the prosecution's X-rated film.
Embarrassed jurors hung their heads, and some offended spectators
walked out.</TE>
<TE>   On the defensive, Jeffers' attorney drew gasps when he presented a
"threatening note" he said had been slipped under his office door,
reading: "Your last warning. Jeffers must be convicted or you die."
In the end, the defense persuaded the jury that the Jefferses were
framed, and they were acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   One night in 1942, three years after his acquittal, Jeffers walked
out on his flock, saying the evening's $125 collection was too small.
Guilt-ridden and afraid of losing him, the congregation collected an
additional $500 in pledges that night. The following year, when Zella
divorced Jeffers for being "under the delusion that he's Jesus
reincarnated," his first wife, Jessie Mayfield Eubanks, sued him for
back alimony and child support for his two children.</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, Jeffers was arrested for stealing the car of one of his
ex-wives. While serving 15 months of a four-year prison term, his
third wife, Helene, stuck by him.</TE>
<TE>   By 1946, Jeffers was a preacher on a mission again, out of prison
and back in the limelight. Hoping to purify his sullied image, he
began conducting "lengthy research on the name of the Creator," and
after "six weeks of fasting," he said that "the name 'Yahweh'" was
revealed to him--even though it had existed in Judeo-Christian
literature for millenniums.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking the Garden of Eden, the couple found it in Laurel Canyon
and called it the Kingdom of Yahweh. At Laurel Canyon Boulevard and
Willow Glen Road, devotees held predawn prayer rituals on the grounds
of a 1915 mansion, reputed to have been Harry Houdini's home--though
Houdini actually had lived across the street.</TE>
<TE>   But Jeffers' troubles were starting anew. His predictions caused
an uproar in the press: that Los Angeles would be hit by a nuclear
holocaust in 1949, and that England would sink into the ocean in
1952. His popularity among believers neither rose nor fell despite
the inaccuracy of his predictions. But paradise was short-lived.
Neighbors complained that the couple were disturbing the peace, which
meant another trial; charges were reduced to a zoning offense. "Love
offerings" began to slow down when more than a dozen disciples sued
Jeffers for fraud and misrepresentation totaling more than $50,000.
His parole was revoked in 1947, and he went back to prison.</TE>
<TE>   When he got out a few years later, he resurfaced in Phoenix,
claiming bankruptcy. When his third wife died in 1957, he married her
18-year-old secretary. Together, they set up a headquarters in
Phoenix, where Jeffers again became a self-styled spiritual guide.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a decade later, the law caught up with him for the last
time. In 1966, a Phoenix jury convicted the 68-year-old Jeffers and
his 27-year-old wife, Connie, of 13 counts of mail fraud for
swindling followers out of $200,000 and gambling it away on dog and
pony races. They were given probation and fined $13,000.</TE>
<TE>   Then they fled for presumably greener pastures and the law never
heard from them again.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On any given Friday night, my family and I close out the week with
dinner at Fashion Island's Atrium Court. Our kids exhaust themselves
running around the fountains and hopping the koi pond. One night I
ventured off alone to shop and wandered into a housewares store. I
couldn't help but eavesdrop on the conversation in progress.</LD>
<LD>   "I have seven children and five grandchildren, so kids are no
problem for me," said the cashier to a male patron in his 50s.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh? What religion are you?" asked the customer.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm Catholic."</TE>
<TE>   There are certain things I have come to swallow, albeit
reluctantly, as a Roman Catholic. The rush to stereotype Catholics is
very typical but nonetheless hurtful. Comments like "Oh, you have a
big family; you must be Catholic" are offensive because they imply
that Catholics look to the church to determine how many children to
have.</TE>
<TE>   Never being favorably portrayed in the media is another price we
Catholics pay. We'll never be referred to with the correct
titles--we're always "antiabortion" rather than "pro-life." It's
frustrating, but I have learned to accept this.</TE>
<TE>   So the recent spotlight over the allegations of sexual abuse of
minors by priests is not at all surprising. And while yes, there is a
lot yet to uncover as these cases unfold, I can't help but feel that
no matter what the outcome, the criticism will continue.</TE>
<TE>   As a mother of three, I have to take into account regularly the
risks involved with my children. If they're invited to a friend's
house, I have to determine that the adults there are "good people."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why I'm scratching my head over all of the now-grown
coming forward alleging abuse, in some cases 20 years after the fact.
One woman claims her priest molested her as a young girl when he
headed up her teen group. "My parents thought nothing of a priest
driving me home at 2 a.m.," she insists.</TE>
<TE>   My response as a parent is, "Why the heck not?" Back when I was a
teen, Pope John Paul could have brought me home at 2 a.m., and my mom
would have seen this as a red flag. She might not have suspected him
of sexual abuse, but she quickly would have put a stop to the
late-night outings.</TE>
<TE>   What I also don't get is why young people were raised to stay
silent if indeed they had been abused. For as much as we're ready to
tar and feather the bishops for not handling the allegations
correctly, I say the same applies to the parents who were clearly out
of touch with their teens. There were also other people in the teens'
lives who might have overlooked signs of abuse--the school counselor,
the gym coach, the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   One friend of mine who has three teenagers offers this
explanation: "The problem is the celibacy vow, and I think priests
should be allowed to have relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Allowing priests to marry can be problematic. I personally think
you have to choose one profession, similar to deciding to be either a
doctor or a lawyer but not both, in order to be effective. A priest
who is constantly ministering to the community would be compromising
his presence at home, much in the same way families of rock stars,
politicians and military personnel live for months on end husband-
and father-free. Yes, celibacy is a tall order, but I don't think
"Honey, why can't you take off work this Sunday?" or "Growing up, my
dad was always gone" is a viable option either.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is we'll never achieve perfection in finding ways to
make sure priests never fall from grace. Members of the clergy, like
all of us, are flawed human beings, and while I'm not trumpeting the
sexual scandal, I think there's room for some--but not total--benefit
of the doubt.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways the bishops' mishandling of the complaints or
knowingly transferring offenders to other parishes compares a lot
with the sexual harassment issue in the workplace we saw in the early
'90s. I don't believe there was the intent to endanger children; I
think the church didn't know how to handle it. It's like the boss who
knows the foreman sexually harasses female employees but hasn't been
given the education or the support to remedy the situation. We're so
ready to condemn, rather than saying, "You're right; this hasn't been
dealt with effectively. Let's put clear guidelines in place."</TE>
<TE>   When you get right down to it, the outrage isn't so much about an
interest in justice or children's well-being as it's about wanting to
see the Catholic Church down on its knees. We like to see the big
guys fall. Pointing to corrupt priests and aloof bishops, and
assuming they played the only errant role, is the essence of this
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody was asleep at the wheel when our children were in
distress--teachers, parents, anyone who knew better and did nothing.
I say we put down our stones, step away from our glass houses and
rebuild with stronger material.</TE>

<HD>A Promise to Our Children</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC FRIEDMAN, LORI MCKENZIE and JOHN GELFF</AU>
<BD>Marc Friedman is with the Rancho Santa Margarita-based
CHARM Foundation (which assists critically ill children and their
families); Lori McKenzie is a board member of the Trabuco Elementary
School PTA; John Gelff is mayor pro tem of San Juan Capistrano.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happens with the Rancho Mission Viejo property, and in fact, the
future of Orange County, is in the hands of all residents of the
region. We believe that preserving the county's history and natural
landscape is essential to preserving our clean air and water, and our
special quality of life.</LD>
<LD>   We, along with many other community leaders, formed the Heart and
Soul Coalition to ensure that our voices are heard in the planning of
the remaining 23,000 acres of Rancho Mission Viejo's largely
undeveloped land, and because our children deserve the permanent
protection of Orange County's natural treasures. We must keep this
promise to them and all future generations.</LD>
<LD>   The Heart and Soul Coalition is a broad-based group of parents,
residents, community leaders, educators, businesses, health and
public safety representatives, environmental and recreation
organizations, elected officials and other citizens from across
Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   Our objective is to preserve our community's heart and soul.
Rancho Mission Viejo, located just inland from San Juan Capistrano,
represents one of the last best hopes for preserving a very special
place.</TE>
<TE>   It supports many rare and unique plants and animals, including the
golden eagle, mountain lion and steelhead trout. Scientists have
determined that Rancho Mission Viejo is a "globally significant
ecological jewel" and is at the center of one of the 25 most unique
areas on the planet. And it's right in our backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of this historically rich land is at stake and its future
is in the hands of all of us who live, work, play and raise families
in this county. At a time when the future of this special place is
being planned, the Heart and Soul Coalition is encouraging the
surrounding communities to work together. It is calling upon our
neighbors and local, state and federal officials to join us in
committing to the following actions:</TE>
<TE>   Public participation: Plan the future of Orange County's last
natural lands based on a responsive and inclusive public
participation process. Our coalition endorses SCORE (South Orange
County Outreach and Review Effort), the action by Supervisor Tom
Wilson to ensure that planning for Rancho Mission Viejo is based on
public participation from all interested parties. The public
expects--indeed we know from recent voting trends that it
demands--greater involvement in planning the future of the county so
the region's heart and soul isn't lost forever. We applaud Wilson's
bold action and call on the public to ensure that its interests and
concerns are heard during the planning process.</TE>
<TE>   Protecting natural landscapes: Locate development only where sound
science has demonstrated it will not harm the rich ecology of this
area or pollute our air and water. The coalition supports the state's
Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP), designed by former Gov.
Pete Wilson and business and environmental leaders, to develop
long-term visions for critical communities, balance economic and
environmental goals and provide a framework for how best to preserve
the region's ecosystem while allowing development in the most
appropriate locations. A study released in October 2001 by the
respected Conservation Biology Institute (CBI) and endorsed by
leading independent scientists, found that the only way to preserve
these unique areas is to leave certain critical landscapes unfettered
by development. We urge all government officials to embrace the NCCP.</TE>
<TE>   Preservation as a top state and federal priority: We call on state
and federal government agencies to make the preservation of Rancho
Mission Viejo a top priority. Sacramento and Washington can and must
do more to ensure this special and unique natural treasure is
preserved for future generations.</TE>
<TE>   Win-win solution: Work with the current stewards of the Rancho
Mission Viejo land to ensure we keep Orange County a place we all
want to live, work and play today and forever.</TE>
<TE>   Keep our promise to our children: We must act to preserve our
quality of life for Orange County's children and future generations
by saving the unique and historic portions of Rancho Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   We are calling upon the entire community to join us in this
promise, so when we look back on this moment and what we've done
together as stewards of our natural treasures, we will know that we
did the right thing for our children.</TE>
<TE>   We will have shaped a future that ensures we have the clean air,
clean water and the natural landscapes that will make up the heart
and soul of their Orange County.</TE>

<LD>At its height, along with the original Spago and Michael's, Citrus
was the quintessential California-French restaurant. The image of that
all-white loft-like space with white market umbrellas unfurled beneath
its soaring roof appeared in all the magazines. Lit as brightly as an
operating room, the kitchen was the theater where patissier-turned-chef
Michel Richard worked his magic for an A-list crowd. But that was before
Citrus--and much of the L.A. restaurant scene--lost its momentum, the
economy slumped, and an unhappy Richard decamped with his family to
Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Citrus had been shuttered for nearly a year before a new restaurant
moved into the Melrose Avenue space. It's called Alex, after chef/owner
Alex Scrimgeour, who last cooked at Saddle Peak Lodge. With this
ambitious new contemporary European restaurant, Scrimgeour, a young Brit
who trained at the Cordon Bleu in Paris and London, is wagering that fine
dining is on its way back. If the recent success of Josie or Melisse is
any indication, he may be onto something.</LD>
<LD>   Like Josie LeBalch's and Josiah Citrin's, Scrimgeour's model is a
rather formal, old-fashioned restaurant with a large menu, thick wine
list and plenty of service. He lards his menu with ingredients such as
caviar, foie gras, black truffles. The danger for a young chef attempting
such a restaurant is the same as for an actor taking on a big
Shakespearean role too soon.</LD>
<TE>   Citrus was more California casual than elegant. So Scrimgeour opened
up the room and subdued the high ceilings by adding dark wood beams. The
bar now flows into the dining room, furnished with deco leather
armchairs. Dark wood furniture and glass panels edged with pale stripes
give the space a Modernist cast. The kitchen, partially screened by a
small fortune in hanging copper pots, now recedes into the background. At
the front, a chorus line of wait staff in white shirts and light blue
ties stands at the ready.</TE>
<TE>   The effect is a sober elegance, a bit staid, nothing like the
freewheeling electric atmosphere that made Citrus such fun. It's a
different time, and definitely a different crowd. Diners, tired of
shouting across tables or squeezing into tight banquettes at other
restaurants, can revel in the distance between tables, the ample
armchairs and the soft lighting.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing trendy about the cooking either, which could be,
mostly, a good thing. The menu is filled with up-to-date buzz words but
it's less wordy than most. Scrimgeour uses straightforward titles for the
dishes and a format that makes it easy to choose. First courses are all
$15, middle courses $12, main courses $29 and desserts $9, with the
occasional choice of foie gras or cheese instead of dessert warranting a
supplement. The four-course prix fixe menu seems like a bargain at $58.
In the end, he steers his guests toward going for the whole deal--not an
easy feat in a town where everyone is habitually watching their abs.</TE>
<TE>   As a first course, Scrimgeour offers his variation of a Thomas Keller
dish that's been making the rounds across the country: butter-poached
lobster. The butter brings out the shellfish's meaty sweetness, so each
bite really tastes of lobster. A rectangular porcelain plate is the blank
canvas for a slice of foie gras au torchon (poached to a rosy color and
chilled) and an even smaller piece of beautifully cooked seared duck
liver that plays the foie gras' cool, silky texture against the fat
richness that oozes from the seared version. There's a beguiling
coriander-crusted skate wing with meltingly tender leeks and a beurre
rouge that's a fine alternative to the traditional brown butter and
capers. Goat cheese souffle, though, is not as fluffy as its name
implies, and basically falls flat.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite of the middle courses is lovely spring asparagus and
quail's egg salad paired with a piquant saffron remoulade. Chilled cherry
tomato consomme perfumed with a swirl of tangerine oil is an agreeable
take on the tomato water that enthralled chefs in France a while back.
Grilled langoustine, when they're as fresh as these very expensive
crustaceans, have enough flavor to stand up to a delicious dab of anchovy
butter. But one night, the langoustine are virtually raw, and it's hard
to find a taste of anchovy in the sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Red meat stars in the c0te de boeuf for two, a hefty piece of prime
beef that comes with a dreamy potato puree. The wild mushroom risotto is
intense, but Scrimgeour gets the texture of the risotto right. A pork
filet is not well served by a bizarre accompani-  accompaniment of
blackberries and agnolotti stuffed with cardamom-infused carrots. When
the waiter one night proposes whole Dover sole, which can be a wonderful
treat, it arrives fileted, as a snaky curl of fish in a fussy preparation
that doesn't allow the flavor of this delicate fish to shine through.
Sometimes a classic doesn't need to be reinvented.</TE>
<TE>   Alex's menu needs more dishes as incisive and delicious as that
butter-poached lobster and the foie gras au torchon.  Less is often more.
The cheese course, for example, would make more of an impact if presented
straight on rather than embellished with extras such as mango chutney.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts are fine but not particularly memorable. The best are the
tall chocolate souffle with an icy star of pistachio creme anglaise, a
gossamer creme brulee spiked with lemon grass, and a banana mille-feuille
set off with a splash of rum and some espresso syrup. Along with the
specials, waiters never fail to mention the option of having Alex cook
for you, at $95 per person. Except for a couple of courses--seared ahi
tuna with a little salad of shaved fennel with mandarin orange and a
seared scallop set on a finely chopped ratatouille--the menu lacked the
pizazz you'd expect.</TE>
<TE>   The service is excellent for such a new restaurant. One night when I
ordered lobster, the amuse bouche for everyone except me was a lobster
bisque with a swirl of cream. I was given diced tuna tartar topped with
caviar, so as not to repeat the lobster. It was a small detail, but
telling.</TE>
<TE>   Alex's eclectic wine list is not huge, but it has interesting, offbeat
wines, particularly from Austria. It's also well-priced.</TE>
<TE>   This restaurant needs more seasoning, but Scrimgeour has all the
elements in place. If this one can find its audience and--along with
Josie and Melisse--join the ranks of Patina and Spago, the door will open
for restaurateurs to start dreaming of fine dining again.</TE>

<HD>Retailers Recruited in Meth War</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Store employees are asked to spot
suspicious purchases of material used to make the drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMBERLY HEFLING</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>OWENSBORO, Ky.</DL>
<LD>OWENSBORO, Ky. -- Four boxes of cold medicine and a suspicious store
clerk put 27-year-old Suzett Calloway back behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   Wanted for murder after her son died from injuries he suffered in
an explosion while, police say, she and her boyfriend were cooking up
methamphetamine in their home, Calloway fled Georgia. She eluded
police for several days until she walked up to a checkout counter at
a Wal-Mart in western Kentucky. She was carrying four boxes of
Sudafed.</LD>
<LD>   The sales clerk, on the lookout for customers buying ingredients
that could be used to make meth, urged a Wal-Mart security guard to
follow Calloway. After a stop for more Sudafed at a second retailer,
Calloway was arrested. She and her boyfriend are in jail awaiting
trial on murder and drug charges; both have pleaded innocent.</LD>
<TE>   Increasingly, police in several states are informally turning to
retailers for assistance in catching meth makers cooking the
lucrative and addictive drug in backyard sheds, motel rooms and vans.</TE>
<TE>   "Without their help, you can't hardly do anything about the meth
problem, at the rate it's increasing," said Trooper Mark Applin of
the Kentucky State Police.</TE>
<TE>   Some retailers say they participate out of a sense of duty. Others
do it to curb meth-cooking shoplifters who might buy one box of a
cold medicine, only to steal three others. Still others worry they
will be forced to keep a buyer's log or face other burdensome
restrictions if they don't do something to help, said Joe Lackey,
president of the Indiana Grocery and Convenience Store Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone likes the idea of police turning to shopkeepers for
help. One civil rights advocate said using retailers to report
shoppers could lead to abuse in evidence gathering. "It's probably
not fair to the manufacturer, but what do you do?" asked Lou Watkins
of Baum's Market in Boonville, Ind., where the bulk of the cold
medicine is kept behind the counter. "They steal more of it than they
buy."</TE>
<TE>   Some call meth the poor man's cocaine because it is a highly
addictive stimulant that produces a euphoria similar to cocaine but
lasts longer: six to eight hours compared with 20 to 60 minutes for
cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most illegal drugs, the products used to make meth are
legal and easily available: cold pills, nail polish remover, rubbing
alcohol, salt and batteries. The recipe is on the Internet. The
overhead costs are low: roughly $100 for a gram, about the contents
of a sugar packet; $400 per ounce, with payoffs of $2,000 to $2,500
per ounce.</TE>
<TE>   "The price of gold is about $320 per ounce. It's worth more than
gold on the streets," said Det. Joe Moran of the Owensboro Police
Department. Nationwide, the number of so-called meth labs seized by
the Drug Enforcement Administration increased from 287 in 1994 to
1,837 in 2000, said Joe Long, a DEA spokesman. That does not include
labs seized by state and local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In street lingo, those who drive from store to store buying or
shoplifting meth ingredients are "P and B" people: pill and lithium
battery buyers.</TE>
<TE>   To cut off the "P and B" people, police in Kentucky and Indiana
say they had to turn to retailers.</TE>
<TE>   They distributed fliers listing meth ingredients and asked store
operators to report license plate numbers of suspicious-looking
customers. In Columbus, Ind., a Wal-Mart employee in March reported
that a customer had attempted to shoplift three boxes of cold
medicine as he purchased rubber gloves and coffee filters.</TE>
<TE>   Police searching the 41-year-old man's car found a "meth lab"
inside it, along with 1,100 cold medicine tablets, Columbus police
Sgt. Matt Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is one that would not have been solved if the Wal-Mart
employee had not caught him shoplifting and called it in," Myers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at Wal-Mart's 2,700 stores are encouraged to help
police, said Rob Phillips, a spokesman at the company's Bentonville,
Ark., headquarters. The store limits the sale of cold medicines and
some diet supplements to three boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about sales," Phillips said. "It's doing what's right."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Johnson, director of government relations for Sudafed
manufacturer Pfizer Inc., said the company supports allowing
consumers to buy a maximum of three boxes of cold medicine.</TE>
<TE>   But it does not back placing cold medicine behind a counter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really outrageous that the illegal activities of these
illicit drug manufacturers and dealers are really turning good
medicines into something quite the contrary," said Bob Fauteux, a
Pfizer spokesman. In the process, he said, they are making it
increasingly difficult for consumers with legitimate needs for the
products to purchase them.</TE>

can be used to make meth.</CP>

<HD>Rocket Attack Targets U.S. Forces</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- For the second time in two weeks, a rocket was
fired at U.S. Special Forces soldiers hunting Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, but it missed, a
local official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The target was a vocational school in Miran Shah, where about
seven Americans are thought to be bunking while working with
Pakistani troops in the semiautonomous tribal region. U.S. officials
have not confirmed the soldiers' presence at the building.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, 36 Afghans on Saturday became the first of about 600
refugees scheduled to return home from Indonesia after they failed to
attain asylum in Australia.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, about 200 Pakistanis captured in Afghanistan while
fighting alongside the Taliban were sent back to their country.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official in Miran Shah
said two rocket launchers had been hooked up with timers and aimed at
the school. The launchers were found in woods less than half a mile
from the building.</TE>
<TE>   The first rocket was fired late Friday and hit a sports complex
150 to 200 yards from the school, causing little damage and no
injuries, he said. The second was set to fire early Saturday but was
defused by authorities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The official said it was not known who was behind the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Early on May 1, a rocket was fired at the same school but struck a
building about 300 yards away. No one was hurt in that attack, the
first time U.S. forces came under fire since they began operating
with Pakistani troops in the region several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of U.S. Special Forces in the frontier area has
provoked protests from the fiercely independent tribesmen, whose
region generally has been off-limits even to the Pakistani army. The
area has been a stronghold of support for Osama bin Laden, and its
religious schools supplied Afghanistan's ousted Taliban with
recruits.</TE>

<HD>Political Killings Hint at Pakistani Dirty War</HD>
<DH>Asia: In the port city of Karachi, bombings and homicides
have become commonplace, yet some see the shadowy hand of national
security forces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Even in the middle of the night, traffic is steady on Sunset
Boulevard, yet Karachi police can't find anyone who saw roadside
assassins fire 14 bullets into two of the city's most popular
politicians.</LD>
<LD>   The two men were moderate, respected leaders of Pakistan's
third-largest political party, which, after years of conflict with
Pakistan's government, was making peace with President Pervez
Musharraf.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Farooq Sattar, a leader of the two men's Muttahida Quami
Movement, says he suspects that the killers got their orders from a
faction of the military's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence
agency, or ISI, the paramilitary Rangers or members of other federal
agencies that he says are conspiring to destroy Musharraf and his
reforms.</LD>
<TE>   Bombings and homicides are so common in Karachi these days that
there are numerous possible motives for the politicians' slaying.</TE>
<TE>   But the timing and targets of the assassins suggest to many here
that elements of Pakistan's security forces are waging a new, dirty
war on the streets of this treacherous port city to undermine
Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   Sattar isn't alone in his suspicions. Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who
heads one of Pakistan's largest religious parties,
Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam, has added his influential voice to
accusations that the army and the ISI are trying to split various
political parties and stir up sectarian violence in cities such as
Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Sattar predicted that enemies within Musharraf's regime will win
unless the army general, who took power in a coup, gets tough with
them soon.</TE>
<TE>   "He's walking a tightrope--no doubt," Sattar said. "But he has to,
very quickly, take care of his 'friends.' He has to be organized to
deal with this religious intolerance, extremism, bigotry and this
monster of a state within a state.</TE>
<TE>   "If he does not get rid of these elements, then he will not be
able to deliver the agenda he is promising to the people of Pakistan
and the international community. This is the last chance for
Pakistan: now or never."</TE>
<TE>   Sattar's party, known as the MQM, wants most federal government
powers to be shifted to the provinces, and Musharraf's promised
reforms would meet at least some of those demands. If Musharraf goes
far enough, agencies such as the ISI will lose a lot of power, and
that is why they want to stop him, Sattar said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Musharraf continues to support the U.S. effort against
foreign Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, there is mounting evidence
that his most important domestic reforms have stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of suspected militants have been released on promises of
good behavior, their leaders have not been put on trial for any
serious crimes, and the government has quietly abandoned a campaign
to collect illegal weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of Musharraf's failure to control extremist groups mounts
with daily killings and bombings. The victims in one recent week's
violence included children maimed by a series of small bombs planted
in garbage heaps where they were scavenging.</TE>
<TE>   Karachi's bloodletting spread to the city center Wednesday, when a
car bomb exploded next to a Pakistani navy bus, killing 11 French
defense contract workers and two Pakistanis, along with the bomber,
in an apparent suicide attack in front of the Sheraton Hotel and
Towers.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Karachi police officers declined interview requests, and
spokesman Ghulam Saqlain said they were under strict orders not to
speak to foreign reporters without written permission from Interior
Ministry officials in the capital, Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, Musharraf's spokesman, called Sattar's
allegations irresponsible and said they were hardly worthy of
comment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most ridiculous claim that anyone could ever make," he
said from Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   No Suspects, Yet Clues oint to an Expert Hand</TE>
<TE>   As in most of the thousands of political killings that have cursed
Karachi over the past decade, police have told the slain politicians'
families that investigators have no suspects and few leads to follow.
The clues that are known suggest an expert hand in the killings.</TE>
<TE>   In the minutes before they were killed April 27, politicians
Mustapha Kamal Rizvi and Nishat Mallick were coming back from dinner
at the nearby Tandoori Hut restaurant in Rizvi's black Toyota
Corolla. Police found it parked, with the engine off, about five
minutes away from the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   The shawarma sandwich Rizvi had promised to bring home to his
wife, Firdaus, 45, was still in the car, and apart from Rizvi's cell
phone and a Rolex watch, nothing was stolen, members of both families
said.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing that her husband was dead, or dying, in the
street, Firdaus called his cell phone six or seven times to warn him
of the shooting outside Mallick's home. Each time she dialed, someone
hung up her husband's phone without speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators told her the cell phone hasn't been found.</TE>
<TE>   Victims Had Not Mentioned Threats</TE>
<TE>   Police took at least 15 minutes to reach the crime scene from the
Gizri station house just a minute's drive away, even though the heavy
fire from two automatic pistols could be heard for blocks in the
wealthy neighborhood, said Mallick's son Ucksy, a 22-year-old medical
student.</TE>
<TE>   The widows of both men said they had never mentioned any death
threats, and described them as gentle men who were working to build
support for Musharraf within their party.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the women suggested a possible motive for the killings.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that my husband was very vocal," said Firdaus
Rizvi, her head covered with a white scarf of mourning. "Rivals are
there in every field, especially if you are so popular, and
successful, and a politician. I'm not saying there were enemies
within, but there could have been."</TE>
<TE>   The MQM, reportedly founded with the ISI's help in the early
1980s, accuses the intelligence agency of backing a splinter group in
1992. The two factions have been killing each other's supporters ever
since, and a growing number of political and religious leaders charge
that the ISI is reviving its divide-and-conquer strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Sattar's MQM faction has won strong support by demanding more
autonomy for Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. When
its exiled leader, Altaf Hussain, sensed that Musharraf was
sympathetic, he offered qualified support to the president as he
asked voters for five more years in power in an April 30 referendum.</TE>
<TE>   The party's backing for Musharraf collapsed after the killings of
Rizvi and Mallick--just one day before what was supposed to be
Musharraf's triumphant, final rally in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   The MQM, which is Karachi's most powerful political party, has
long accused the shadowy ISI of killing party leaders, supporters and
members of their families. But that seemed to change after
Musharraf's bloodless coup in October 1999, Sattar said.</TE>
<TE>   Like most in the MQM's power base, Musharraf is a refugee of
India's partition in 1947, when millions of Urdu-speaking Muslims
fled violent mobs into the newly created Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   That makes him a minority in Pakistan's military and security
apparatus, which is dominated by ethnic Punjabis and Pathans. Many
members of the security forces still sympathize with the religious
extremists that Musharraf says he wants to eradicate.</TE>
<TE>   Karachi's violence, and complaints of torture in police custody,
dropped off sharply after Musharraf seized power and quietly began to
reach out to the MQM, Sattar said.</TE>
<TE>   Banned Groups Still Publish Openly</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, as Musharraf's critics complain that his reforms
are faltering, at least four extremist and terrorist groups that the
president banned are openly publishing newspapers and magazines.</TE>
<TE>   In Peshawar, where Taliban officials secretly come and go as U.S.
and Pakistani forces conduct search missions along the nearby Afghan
border, the Zarb-i-Momin, or Blow of the Believer, is a newsstand
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Published in Karachi by the Al Rashid trust, a group banned by the
U.S. and Pakistan because of alleged Al Qaeda links, the newspaper
exhorts readers to support the Taliban as it battles U.S. forces in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The lead editorial in Saturday's issue praised Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan, calling
him "Emir al Momineen," or "Leader of the Faithful."</TE>
<TE>   "The popularity of Emir al Momineen among the Afghan people is
evidence that he did not rule the people through power, but through
his piety, honesty and love for Islam," the newspaper said. "The
people of Afghanistan will continue to love him as long as they have
a single spark of belief in their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   The MQM points to the recent reinstatement of at least five police
officers it accuses of waging a covert war against the party as proof
that orders have been issued to escalate the campaign again. One of
the officers is Chaudhry Mohammed Aslam, deputy superintendent of
police.</TE>
<TE>   In a May 2 letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, an MQM
leader, Imran Farooq, accused Aslam of personal responsibility for
the December 1995 abduction, torture and murder of the brother and
nephew of party leader Hussain.</TE>
<TE>   Aslam was also the lead investigator in the November 1997 killings
of four U.S. oil workers and their Pakistani driver.</TE>
<TE>   A special anti-terrorism court sentenced two MQM party members to
death for the murders in August 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But at the time, U.S. officials questioned whether the real
culprits had been caught and didn't pay out a $2-million reward
offered to anyone providing information leading to the arrest of the
four Americans' killers.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the State Department more than doubled the reward to $5
million for information or other assistance leading to the arrest or
conviction "of those responsible for this cowardly attack against
civilians," says the reward offer still posted on the State
Department's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Despite official denials from Musharraf's government, Sattar
insisted that the general knows that conspirators within his own
government are working against him. Sattar also says Musharraf is
still trying "to mend fences" with the MQM through secret contacts
with party leaders in London.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf spokesman Qureshi insisted: "I'm not aware of any
such discussion."</TE>

<HD>The Bird Men of Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Culture: In a nation rife with rivalry, fighting
partridges-or kites or eggs-is a passion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- There are many tricks and almost as many rules
in the ancient Afghan sport of partridge fighting.</LD>
<LD>   It takes a year to raise a bird that will fight perhaps nine or 10
times in its life if it's a winner, and even fewer if it loses. So
the bird men of Kabul do whatever they can to give their own
partridge--or kawk, in Farsi--an edge.</LD>
<LD>   The night before a fight, some feed the bird a scorpion with the
sting removed and just enough residual poison to anesthetize the bird
to pain and fear. Others use a peck of opium to do the same. Both are
allowed under the rules.</LD>
<TE>   Then there are illegal tricks: sprinkling a bird's neck
feathers--the target area for attack--with alcohol, chili, pepper or
bitter walnut leaves to put the other partridge off.</TE>
<TE>   Spring has brought the return of partridge fighting, perhaps
Kabul's favorite gambling sport--and one that usually ends with one
bird running away before blood is drawn.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans have a keen sense of rivalry and competition, as 23 years
of war suggests. Each Friday in this capital city and elsewhere, they
stage partridge fights, cockfights, dogfights, even kamikaze kite
fights and boiled-egg fights, all banned under the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The bird men come out at the first soft light bearing bright
cloth-covered domes of scarlet, green and blue that conceal wooden
hooped cages with the fighting birds. The top birds are worth $500, a
fortune in this shattered country. Hundreds gather in a ring for the
first fight of the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammad Afzal, 70, is a fanatic, bouncing up and down in the
front row, yelling out odds to other gamblers, putting money on one
fighting partridge, then laying more money the other way. He got
involved in partridge fighting when he was 20.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I win 3 or 4 million afghanis [$90 to $120]. Sometimes
I lose that much," he says with a shrug, unsure whether he has been
an overall winner or loser in his life. He says that he was bored
senseless in the early months of the Taliban rule because of the ban
on fights but that soon they were organized secretly in houses and
yards.</TE>
<TE>   To an outsider, the competition looks almost comical, as the birds
leap high into the air as if surprised, head-butt each other, run
away and lock into a low, hunched stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   With their smoky gray plumage and black barred wings, they look at
first as mild as Christmas card partridges in a pear tree. But up
close, their red-rimmed eyes and razor-sharp beaks give them a fierce
aura.</TE>
<TE>   Before the fight, owners sharpen their birds' beaks with a knife
and trim their claws with a nail-cutter so they don't split. In the
fights, the partridges peck each other with reasonable vigor, but
blood is very rarely shed.</TE>
<TE>   The welfare of the birds seems uppermost in the minds of the
referees-cum-cage-carriers, who don't allow the partridges to get
exhausted, weak or overcome. They prowl around the fighting birds and
at any sign of tiredness drop a cage over each bird until it's
rested.</TE>
<TE>   Two bird-fanners are summoned to vigorously flap pieces of
material to cool and calm the birds at each break. An elderly man has
the job of watering the arena to keep the dust down.</TE>
<TE>   The frequent intervals give the gamblers time to up their odds.</TE>
<TE>   At times a referee picks up a bird and appears to kiss it. In
fact, with his hands occupied holding the bird, he is picking a
feather off the bird's beak with his teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Some matches are over in minutes, when one bird takes fright and
runs off, refusing to fight. Most continue up to half an hour, but
some fights can last as long as two hours.</TE>
<TE>   No one could be a better guide through the maze of rules than
Abdul Ghani, 45, partridge expert.</TE>
<TE>   A week before the fight, the birds are weighed and the owners, or
bird syndicates, put down an advance of $200 to $400 to fight. If the
bird is injured before the fight or is ill, the owner either fights
it or loses the deposit.</TE>
<TE>   "If the two birds are fighting and one loses its nail or beak, the
owner pays half the money because his partridge has not really lost.
It faced an accident and was only half-defeated," explains the
gray-bearded Ghani, who knows everyone on the partridge-fighting
circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to train a bird. You have to take it high
into the mountains to run like a sportsman, so that it develops its
lung capacity," he says, adding that this is done twice daily except
for Tuesday, when partridges are usually given damp soil to play in.</TE>
<TE>   After each fight, the birds get a special but unpleasant medicinal
treatment that owners swear helps to ease the exhaustion of the
fighting birds.</TE>
<TE>   "You take some pomegranate skin and turmeric and put it on the
bird and roll it tightly in a piece of cloth covering everything
except its head. Then you leave it until the partridge feels it can't
breathe. When it is gasping and about to die from shortage of breath,
you take the cloth away," Ghani says. "For one or two nights it's
insensible. Then after two or three weeks, they can begin practice
fighting, so they will be ready to fight again."</TE>
<TE>   The best ages to fight a partridge are between 3 and 6. They fight
perhaps three times each spring. More often than that, and their
livers might burst from the stress of the fights, Ghani warns.</TE>
<TE>   After a bird loses, it usually gets spooked and isn't fit to fight
for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "This business doesn't bring any money," Ghani, who owns two
birds, says glumly. "It's fate--it's a gamble."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Ghani makes more money gambling on the birds than he says,
he, like most of the crowd, is clearly carried away by the thrill of
the sport. His eyes light up as he launches into zesty descriptions
of its intricacies, and he eyes a newcomer with a smile at any sign
of appreciation of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps what makes partridge fighting so addictive is the
unpredictability, even as the match is underway. A smaller bird might
appear to be losing, when suddenly the larger bird might turn tail
and run, for no apparent reason. So gamblers constantly yell out new
bets as the match unfolds.</TE>
<TE>   With his beady eyes and beaky nose, Qaladar, 80, bears a passing
resemblance to the birds to which he has devoted his life. Like many
Afghans, he goes by one name.</TE>
<TE>   He began fighting birds at 15, continued secretly through the
Taliban era, and now owns four partridges.</TE>
<TE>   "We never fight without a bet," he says, cackling. "All that
trouble for nothing? Never!</TE>
<TE>   "My birds win, by God's grace. My beard is white. I am very
experienced in this game."</TE>
<TE>   His most painful moment came when the Taliban raided a clandestine
fight in which he had entered an excellent partridge. He and the
other owners were forced to flee, abandoning their birds.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all a Taliban plot to get my partridge and another man's
partridge because they knew they were the best birds," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   At the ragged edges of the partridge-fighting crowd, small boys
sell red boiled eggs for fights. After carefully testing his egg for
strength by hitting it against his front teeth, a competitor knocks
an end of his egg against an opponent's end. The one with the cracked
egg is the loser.</TE>
<TE>   The aim, Afghan egg experts say, is to hit the opponent's egg
slightly off center. Anyone who so much as casts an interested glance
at the baskets of eggs will immediately be surrounded by small boys
pleading to fight eggs. Friday afternoons, men and children gather to
fight kites, sailing bright paper ones high in the air, then
attacking with a sawing motion of the string to slash an enemy kite
free. Teams of boys run around bearing long sticks with barbed-wire
hooks attached, designed to rescue stray kites from trees.</TE>
<TE>   But in the absence of partridges, dogs, eggs or kites, Afghans
still can't resist a competition. A hand grabs a pile of sugared
almonds, and a new challenge is shouted forth: odd or even?</TE>
<TE>   The participants count the nuts to find the winner, and then share
them, grinning from ear to ear.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Police said Saturday that they were hunting for three suspects
believed to have bought a car used in a suicide bombing last week
that killed the bomber and 11 French citizens.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of the 11 Westerners were handed over to French
officials at a somber ceremony and were to be flown to France.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistani authorities have issued sketches of the three suspects,
who are believed to have paid about $1,700 for the beaten-up 1974
Toyota a day before Wednesday's attack in Karachi. A reward of
$34,000 has been offered for clues leading to a breakthrough.</LD>
<TE>   "We have some information about the three suspects, and we have
also collected some evidence from the scene of the occurrence, but I
cannot say that we have made any major breakthrough," said a senior
police official, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide bomber drove alongside a Pakistani navy bus Wednesday
morning, detonating a powerful bomb that killed 11 French navy
experts and two Pakistanis and wounded 22 people.</TE>
<TE>   The blast blew a crater in the road, reduced the bus to a twisted
and blackened skeleton, and splattered blood and body parts down the
street.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve French citizens wounded in the blast were flown to Paris on
a German military hospital plane Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, about 500 mourners, including the French
ambassador to Pakistan, about 90 other French nationals and senior
Pakistani navy and government officials, gathered at a naval hospital
in Karachi to pay their respects to the victims.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan</DL>
<LD>Thousands of independence activists took to the streets of Taiwan's
capital, Taipei, on Saturday, campaigning for the island to be
officially called Taiwan rather than the Republic of China.</LD>
<LD>   "We are here today to identify who we are," Chen Lung-chu, one of
the organizers, said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are Taiwanese."</LD>
<TE>   Self-governing Taiwan is officially known as the Republic of
China. The Communist mainland, which regards the island as a renegade
province, is known as the People's Republic of China.</TE>
<TE>   The chanting protesters carried placards and marched to the
presidential office to demand that the island's official title be
changed to Taiwan to remove any reference to the mainland. Protesters
had earlier hurled rocks at a handful of unification supporters who
appeared at the scene in an attempt to lodge a counter- protest.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-independence protesters said their march was also aimed at
raising Taiwan's international profile.</TE>
<TE>   "Only when the name of Taiwan appears on the nation's title can
Taiwan be recognized by the international society," said protester
Wei Chien-mao.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing says the self-governing island must be brought under its
rule, by force if necessary, and has threatened to attack if it
declares statehood.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, has mellowed his
pro-independence stance but refuses to embrace Beijing's "one China"
principle, which states that Taiwan is a part of China.</TE>

<HD>India, U.S. Stage Joint Army Exercise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Indian and U.S. troops launched their biggest joint military exercise
in nearly 40 years Saturday, marking another step in the growing ties
between the world's two largest democracies that once sat on opposite
sides in the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   "Exercises opened today and would continue for the next two weeks.
It's the largest army exercise involving Indian and U.S. ground
forces," a U.S. Embassy spokesman here said.</LD>
<LD>   Exercise Balance Iroquois, in the northern Indian tourist town of
Agra, comes in the midst of India's latest tense military standoff
with nuclear rival Pakistan, which was triggered by an attack on the
Indian Parliament in December.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly a million troops are massed on both sides of the border,
raising fears of a fourth war between the neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The United States suspended military links with India and Pakistan
after both carried out nuclear tests in 1998, but ties have resumed
with the two nations, especially after they backed the U.S.-led war
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "It is part of growing military relations between the two
countries. It will make operations better," the spokesman said of the
exercise with India. He said special operations forces from the
Asia-Pacific Command are participating.</TE>
<TE>   Indian officials were not immediately available to give details on
the number of soldiers participating in the exercise, taking place
about 400 miles from the Pakistan border.</TE>
<TE>   Though Pakistan has been a U.S. ally much longer than India, New
Delhi has continued strengthening ties with Washington in recent
months. Top military officials have exchanged visits, and Washington
agreed to resume sales of defense equipment that were banned under
sanctions imposed after India's nuclear tests.</TE>

<LD>Bush administration officials are exploring ways to use the public's
patriotic response to the Sept. 11 attacks to promote the teaching of
civics and citizenship in American classrooms, a U.S. official said.</LD>
<LD>   A working group from several Cabinet departments and federal
agencies is looking for "resources and options" to support civics
education in the public schools, said Lindsey Kozberg, communication
director for the USA Freedom Corps.</LD>
<LD>   Kozberg said there is no timetable for the interagency group to
conclude its study of the issue.</LD>

<LD>   Olowalu Beach in west Maui will have about seven signs placed in
the area to warn visitors about possible shark-inhabited waters.</LD>
<LD>   "It has a local reputation that goes back a long way as a place
that has lots of sharks," said Randy Honebrink of the state Shark
Task Force. "People who live on Maui are aware of that. But people
who come from other places are not."</LD>

<HD>Year-Old Clues Led to Columbine Searches</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LITTLETON, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Hours after Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 13 people at
Columbine High School, authorities obtained search warrants for their
homes using year-old evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's officials had said in 1998 that there wasn't enough
evidence of a crime to pursue reports that Harris and Klebold were
threatening others and making bombs.</LD>
<LD>   After the two killed 12 students and a teacher before killing
themselves on April 20, 1999, at the school near Denver, those 1998
reports were used to obtain search warrants, according to documents
released Friday under court order.</LD>
<TE>   They show for the first time that a warning about Harris from
Randy and Judy Brown had been used to get permission to search
Harris' and Klebold's homes. In March 1998, the Browns gave
authorities violent writings from Harris' Web site, including a death
threat against their son, Brooks, and descriptions of pipe bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators drafted an affidavit to justify a search of Harris'
home, but they never showed it to a judge and eventually dropped the
case.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer I think about it, the madder I get," Judy Brown said
of the documents.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's spokesman Jim Shires said Friday that the value of the
Browns' report may not have been clear until after Columbine.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, anything that's going to be in hindsight is 20/20."</TE>

<HD>A Cross-Fire of Visions for a New U.S. Military</HD>
<DH>Weaponry: Secretary of Defense wants to cancel the
$11-billion Crusader, saying the 40-ton cannon is unsuitable for
battles of tomorrow. But Army brass sees system as vital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>To a soldier on the front lines, few sights are more welcome than a
big American gun nearby, pounding the enemy.</LD>
<LD>   That is a major reason why the fight over whether to cancel the
Crusader artillery system, which will spill into the Senate this
week, is proving to be so sensitive inside the Pentagon and Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Many Army generals believe the Crusader would help ensure that GIs
have all the support firepower they need if called into a major
ground war. In the Crusader, they see a mobile cannon designed to
pulverize large numbers of enemy soldiers before they can attack.</LD>
<TE>   But those generals have been overruled by Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld. Seeking a lighter, more lethal force, Rumsfeld contends
that the 40-ton piece of weaponry is so heavy that the Pentagon would
have trouble getting it to tomorrow's battlefields in time.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, the debate is about the politics of $11 billion in
defense spending. Leading congressional supporters of the system,
Oklahoma Republicans, are scrambling to save the Crusader, and with
it a lucrative home-state weapon contract.</TE>
<TE>   But underneath are competing strategic visions for the armed
services and whether the military should, literally, lose some
weight.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Army, despite the rising importance of air power in
modern warfare, many generals still place great faith in ground
artillery. It is a faith based on the service's history, tradition
and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're an infantryman, and you're standing on a hilltop and
you call in close air support, you can be waiting for up to an hour
to get that," a senior Army general said. "And when you're in combat,
minutes turn to hours. It becomes a little like ordering a pizza from
a subcontractor on a Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "With artillery, you tell your guy you need it, and it's there."</TE>
<TE>   The system began development in 1994 after the Persian Gulf War.
Even though the U.S. forces easily won that war, U.S. generals
fretted at the time that their Vietnam-era artillery didn't match up
with Iraqi guns.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader, a 155-millimeter, self-propelled howitzer, can lob
10 to 12 rounds per minute, or three times as many as the system it
would replace, known as the Paladin. The Crusader can hit targets 30
miles away, compared to Paladin's range of about 19 miles.
Computerized robotic systems handle ammunition and firing. The weapon
is being built by United Defense LP, a unit of the Carlyle Group, and
is scheduled for deployment by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   "Its relentless firepower and range weakens our enemies--before
they get close enough to harm us," says www.teamcrusader.com, a Web
site run by groups lobbying for the system.</TE>
<TE>   But the weight of the mobile cannon, 40 tons, and that of its
resupply vehicle, 34 tons, pose a significant disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   It requires ships or exceptionally large cargo planes--and a lot
of planning--to move around the world. And once the Crusader arrives
at a conflict zone, some worry, it might be too heavy for local roads
or bridges to handle.</TE>
<TE>   Recent military conflicts have exposed another potential weakness:
firing precision. What mattered in remote Afghan mountains was
hitting small pockets of Al Qaeda fighters who were making themselves
elusive targets. That's not Crusader's specialty. It is designed to
spray fire at enemies over a wide terrain.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the Crusader "out of date" is its imprecision, says
Daniel Goure, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, a
conservative think tank in Arlington, Va. "It's what you use when
you're facing hordes of Russians, not what you use when you're facing
specific targets."</TE>
<TE>   The Army has been considering the pros and cons of the Crusader in
recent years as it reviewed global strategy after the Cold War.
Especially since the 1999 conflict in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, when the Army faced embarrassing delays in deployment of key
weapons, it has come under pressure to become a lighter, faster
expeditionary force.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to that call, the Army shed many tons from the original
design of the Crusader and cut back on the number of units to be
manufactured. But it has resisted, until now, efforts to kill the
program outright. Last week the Army reluctantly fell into line
behind Rumsfeld's order to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The decision remains subject to congressional review. The House
early Friday approved a defense bill with a provision urging the
Pentagon not to kill the system. The Senate Armed Services Committee
on Thursday will quiz Rumsfeld and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric K.
Shinseki on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The reason the Army resisted for so long is that defense
strategists still have not reached consensus on what coming wars will
look like. Will they be in the deserts of the Middle East? In Africa?
On the Korean peninsula? Does the Pentagon still need to plan for
battle in Europe?</TE>
<TE>   "If you're looking to an uncertain future, where you really can't
predict the one or two enemies that you're going to fight, you say,
'What kind of a force are we going to need?'" said a top Army
strategist. "And the answer kept coming back to, 'You've got to have
a little light, you've got to have a little heavy.'"</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, told reporters Friday that he was withholding judgment on
the Crusader until he hears directly from Rumsfeld. Until recently,
Levin said, Rumsfeld and the Army had argued strongly for the weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to hear both cases," Levin said at a news conference.
"There's obviously a U-turn here that's been taken by the secretary
of Defense."</TE>

<HD>Rich Landlord in Eviction Case Sues Calif. Firm</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>A Japanese billionaire accused of having dilapidated homes after he
tried to evict hundreds of renters in California is suing a real
estate firm, claiming it mismanaged his properties.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit filed Friday in federal court on behalf of Gensiro
Kawamoto against CB Richard Ellis Inc. of Sacramento claims an
unspecified amount of damages for alleged wrongful acts, including
breach of contract.</LD>
<LD>   Kawamoto, a reclusive businessman with investments in California
and Hawaii, issued 570 eviction notices in February to tenants in
Sacramento and Santa Rosa, giving them 30 days to move out. He
extended the deadline to June after an intense public outcry.</LD>
<TE>   He has said he plans to sell the properties to raise money for
other investments. But authorities said they suspect Kawamoto may
have tried to evict tenants because they complained about problems,
including mold that caused bloody noses, rashes, fatigue and
respiratory problems.</TE>
<TE>   On April 29, Kawamoto settled a lawsuit accusing him of keeping
149 rental homes in Santa Rosa in disrepair. Under the settlement, he
is required to pay the county $80,000 in legal fees, make thousands
of dollars worth of repairs and offer current and some former tenants
up to two months' free rent.</TE>
<TE>   CB Richard Ellis officials did not immediately return calls
seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Marines Set Aside Go-It-Alone Attitude</HD>
<DH>Military: Plans call for special forces to help in next
phase of war on terrorism. It's a move away from the branch's
historic aloofness toward the other services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON</DL>
<LD>When Americans think of the U.S. military's elite, Army Rangers and
Navy SEALs come to mind--not the Marine Corps' Force Reconnaissance.</LD>
<LD>   That could change with a decision by the Marine Corps to drop what
some saw as organizational aloofness and join the other military
services in coordinating special warfare operations.</LD>
<LD>   In another sign that the war on terrorism is reshaping the U.S.
military, officials from the Marine Corps and the U.S. Special
Operations Command recently met to discuss how Force Recon and other
Marines trained in special operations can help as the war enters its
next phase.</LD>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, the Marine Corps had largely remained unconnected
to SOCOM, the control center in Tampa, Fla., that Congress
established in 1987 to handle special operations planning and reduce
interservice rivalry. The Marines have been the only service not to
commit troops to SOCOM.</TE>
<TE>   But the war in Afghanistan--and Marine Commandant Gen. James L.
Jones Jr.'s desire to bolster Force Recon and the Marines' other
special operations units--led to a change that was unthinkable until
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, whose father commanded an amphibious reconnaissance company
in World War II, is considering organizing a reconnaissance unit
specifically for SOCOM, a major commitment for an organization such
as the Marine Corps with an unusually small budget and a go-it-alone
ethos.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Col. Fred Peck said the commitment to SOCOM shows the
Marine Corps is moving away from its historic aversion to getting
involved in operations with other services.</TE>
<TE>   ''The conventional wisdom used to be: If we carve out our own
unique niche, then we won't have to engage in turf wars with our much
larger service brothers,'' Peck said. ''Jumping into the joint arena
was greatly feared [by Marine brass] for a long while.''</TE>
<TE>   Like other military planners, Jones believes the war on terrorism
will be fought less by massive headlong assaults and more by small
units that can move quickly, conduct surveillance and
intelligence-gathering, then apply firepower in concentrated bursts.</TE>
<TE>   "'The Sands of Iwo Jima' is a great movie, but it doesn't reflect
the reality of how we will fight in the future," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the Marines have already adroitly adapted to the new
kind of warfare that emphasizes joint operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Marines see a [need] for fast, light, mobile units that they
believe they can fill quickly because it suits who they already are,"
said Charles Pena, senior defense policy analyst at the Cato
Institute, a Washington-based Libertarian think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing the Marines want is to be left on the bench in the
next war," Pena added.</TE>
<TE>   Overshadowed by their more publicized counterparts in the Army and
Navy, the Marine Corps' equivalent of special forces got little
notice in the weeks preceding the Oct. 7 start of the U.S. offensive
in Afghanistan--even though special operations Marines from Camp
Pendleton and Camp Lejeune, N.C., were already on ships in the
Arabian Sea and in secret bases in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   With about 800 personnel, the Marines' special operation force is
the smallest of the military's special forces units. The Navy has
about 4,500 such personnel and the Army about 25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Formed during World War II, Force Recon is trained for most of the
same missions as Navy SEALs and Army Special Forces, although they
are not taught to rescue hostages or work with "indigenous" forces
such as the Afghan resistance fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Force Recon is only the core of the Marines' special operations
capability. When they deploy, they are supplemented by other combat
Marines who have received special training.</TE>
<TE>   If the Marines were overlooked in the media buildup to the Afghan
offensive, it may have been their own fault.</TE>
<TE>   Force Recon and other special operations-trained Marines have
never received the self-promotion that the Navy lavishes on its SEALs
or the Army on its Green Berets and Rangers. It is both a source of
pride and annoyance to Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "Relatively unknown outside of the Department of Defense, they
neither seek nor suffer the publicity of others in the business,"
says a Web site organized by former Force Recon Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Author Tom Clancy barely mentions the Marines in his new book,
"Shadow Warriors: Inside the Special Forces," written with former
SOCOM commander Carl Stiner.</TE>
<TE>   One problem for the Marine Corps may begin with its vocabulary: It
avoids the term "special forces," which has become a media buzz
phrase. Another problem is cultural: Marines tend to downplay any
suggestion of elitism within their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "The Marine Corps has a lot of aspects that are deeply deadly,"
said Capt. Anthony Bolden, operations officer with Force Recon at
Camp Pendleton. "We're just one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the new SOCOM partnership, the Marines also are seeking
to boost the appeal of Force Recon within its ranks by changing their
rules to allow enlisted personnel to make a career in a
reconnaissance unit. Until now, enlisted Marines had to leave the
unit to get promoted beyond a midgrade level, which led to turnover
and loss of continuity.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, a Force Recon unit from Camp Pendleton organized
"hunter-killer" teams in early December to block Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces from fleeing the battle at Kandahar, the kind of mission that
might have gone to an Army Special Forces unit.</TE>
<TE>   Before they left the outpost dubbed Camp Rhino, the Marines got a
lecture from Brig. Gen. James Mattis.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time they [Taliban and Al Qaeda] run into U.S. Marines,
I want it to be the most traumatic experience of their miserable
lives," Mattis told his Marines. "I want them to fear us and never
want to engage us again."</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, Force Recon had entered into a point-blank firefight
under the pitch-black Central Asia sky, leaving eight enemy dead
along a stretch of road known as Route 1. An airstrike killed dozens
more. Taliban and Al Qaeda forces never again tried to use that strip
of road.</TE>
<TE>   Army Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan,
sent the Marines a note saying their prowess as a "power projection
strike force was superbly demonstrated" on Route 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such an obviously good thing for the nation," Jones said of
the new ties between the corps and SOCOM, "and for the Marine Corps."</TE>

<HD>Praising Cod, and Puns for the Halibut</HD>
<DH>Houston: Adding spice to city's restaurant scene, Indian
eatery takes aim at a neighbor's marquee. The fish house diligently
plays the straight man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>When heat quivers over rush hour at one of the busiest intersections
in town, when the thick air is a sickly swirl of crawfish etouffe and
chicken masala and tortilla soup all a-simmer in the restaurants
crowded together on the tar, there isn't much for a weary driver to
do but peruse the jumble of billboards.</LD>
<LD>   "Order Kalamari, Get a Pappa's T-Shirt Free," suggests Pappadeaux
Seafood Kitchen, a Cajun fish house.</LD>
<LD>   Next door, Khyber North Indian Grill shoots back: "Squid Pro Quo."</LD>
<TE>   "Come Try Our Stuffed Flounder," Pappadeaux urges another day.</TE>
<TE>   "On What Charge?" puns Khyber.</TE>
<TE>   This is the story of an Indian immigrant with an insurgent spirit
and a bottomless appetite for wordplay who found his soapbox, canvas
and stage in the form of a roadside marquee. But his torrent of daily
puns is something of a tragicomedy in plastic, for Mickey Kapoor has
spent nearly a decade trying to needle a rise out of his stoic
neighbor, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "Every Tuesday's Fat Tuesday!" the seafood house enthuses.</TE>
<TE>   "Praise the Lard!" Khyber smirks.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs is a quintessential dispute in this city of patchwork
ethnicity, this thriving immigration hub that knows no zoning laws.
It is a landscape that is seldom pretty but almost always
interesting, with its haphazard mix of fortunetellers, Montessori
schools and Vietnamese grocery stores. It is also a city of cars, a
town that exists in the frame of a windshield.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I supposed to do, put a price up there? It's just so
dull," Kapoor said. "Instead, I go for the moral low ground."</TE>
<TE>   He's built up a loyal following: Kapoor's phone shrills with
impatient calls from marquee-watchers if he hasn't drummed up a fresh
pun by lunchtime. Hundreds have strolled into his brick eatery of
brass hookahs and Afghan carpets not to nibble on his saag paneer but
to meet the man who calls himself the "Marquee de Sade."</TE>
<TE>   Kapoor found his calling eight years ago, when he sank wearily
into the park bench outside his brand-new Indian eatery. This was his
third Houston restaurant; he'd been working his way in from the
outskirts of town for years. As real estate goes, he'd finally
arrived, with a slice of concrete on a bustling intersection midway
between the wealthy River Oaks enclave and Rice University.</TE>
<TE>   It's a moment Kapoor now refers to as "one little cosmic
accident." His eye fell on the sign next door. "Go Rockets!" he
read--and snorted to himself. How dull, he thought. How banal. Was
that any way to root for the home basketball team? Obviously, his new
environs needed a creative infusion. And so he posted a retort: "And
Please Come Back!"</TE>
<TE>   That first mischievous shot started a steely--and one-sided--war.
Day after day, for eight sarcastic years, each manager at the seafood
house has played the straight man to Kapoor's relentless clowning.
Pappadeaux is Felix to Oscar, George to Gracie, Rowan to Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Crab Fingers Are Delightful!" Pappadeaux chirps.</TE>
<TE>   "Let No Crab Give You the Finger," snickers the peanut gallery
next door.</TE>
<TE>   Pappadeaux has borne the ribbing with the deliberate oblivion of a
kid who has convinced himself that the bullies will get bored and
leave him alone--if only he ignores their jeers. Manager Jennifer
Brewer said she doesn't mind the signboard next door. She's new on
the job, she said, and so are the other managers.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't even seen anything that makes sense as far as dogging
us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's an impressive show of restraint from a restaurant whose
customers pass under the shadow of a massive pink and orange trout to
cross the threshold. A frame of soggy boardwalk rings the base of
Pappadeaux's marquee. A motorboat is wedged through the signpost, as
if some drunken fisherman ran aground, hopped down to earth and
wandered off into this ghostly jungle of traffic lights and strip
malls.</TE>
<TE>   Pappadeaux's unflinching equanimity is a sore spot for Kapoor, who
dreams of a neighbor who'd fire back a block-letter rejoinder. "Oh,
these poor guys," Kapoor said in one of his few quiet moments.
"They've taken such a beating over the years."</TE>
<TE>   But his remorse is short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Hiring Today 3-5," Pappadeaux announced one morning.</TE>
<TE>   "My You Do Start Them Young," Khyber cooed.</TE>
<TE>   Kapoor doesn't confine himself to tormenting the fish restaurant
next door. He's angered animal rights groups with "Let Our Kharma Run
Over Your Dogma." One Mother's Day, he quipped, "If Gandhi's Mother
Had Cooked Like This, He Might Never Have Fasted." That aphorism
brought the wrath of thousands--"it seemed like thousands,
anyway"--of his fellow Indians.</TE>
<TE>   To the dismay of the disgruntled, Kapoor delights in every second
of scandal. "When they get offended," he explained, "you've scored."</TE>
<TE>   That's just one of the laws of the billboard war, whose etiquette
is far more nuanced than it looks. There are two kinds of rules:
those Kapoor cheerfully disregards and the ones he follows
religiously. Years back, when Pappadeaux managers complained they
were being harassed, the two eateries hammered out a rough agreement.
Kapoor promised not to disparage the food or the staff.</TE>
<TE>   He's been breaking his word ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, here we are insulting the food, which means we are
breaking a ground rule," he said, pointing in the general direction
of his signpost and arching his brows. It was a Secretary's Day, and
the Pappadeaux billboard gushed: "Your Secretary Will Fall in Love
With Our Blackened Tuna."</TE>
<TE>   "As They Say Love Is Blind," Khyber said.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the rules Kapoor embraces are the ones he dreamed up
for himself, the ones designed to make wordsmithing a more complex
sport. He doesn't like to repeat himself, even when Pappadeaux trots
out the same old platitudes. Even trickier: He doesn't think it's
fair game to parrot the words in the original message.</TE>
<TE>   Born in India and raised in London, Kapoor is a die-hard pun
maestro in wire-rimmed glasses. Take away his coffee cup and he'll
snap, "That's a coffee-right infringement." He calls it an
affliction, says he hears voices in his bald head.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time for his citizenship interview, Kapoor almost
talked himself out of the United States. He couldn't resist, not when
the somber man across the table asked, "Do you believe in the
overthrow of the U.S. government by force or subversion?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take subversion," Kapoor replied.</TE>
<TE>   Kapoor remembers his questioner leaning forward and saying, very
seriously, "This is not a multiple-choice question."</TE>
<TE>   "In that case, vehemently no," a remorseful Kapoor said.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought, 'Oh, the little brown man doesn't understand,'"
Kapoor said, and he choked on a fit of laughter. "Lucky for me."</TE>
<TE>   He got his citizenship anyway.</TE>

<HD>Winter Games' Glitter Loses Its Glow in Salt Lake</HD>
<DH>Olympics: The host town had hoped for a bonanza in tourism
and business growth. Now 'it's worse than before,' one merchant says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Standing on Main Street on a recent spring evening, it's difficult to
conjure up the nighttime scene that existed here only two months ago,
during the Winter Olympics: Lights, music, street theater ... people.</LD>
<LD>   Now, only an hour after most offices have closed, the main
pedestrian mall is deserted. Stores are shuttered. Those people who
are here are waiting for the light rail train that will carry them
home to the suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   The post-Olympic blues have hit Salt Lake City hard, in ways many
here would not have imagined.</LD>
<TE>   This buttoned-up town was transformed for three weeks in February
into a sophisticated, multicultural mecca. Now, everything's back to
normal and people here miss the crowds, the diversity, the excitement
and the happy mess that comes with hosting an international event.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurateurs and retailers long for the business the Games
generated. City and state officials may regret they created such high
expectations that the Olympic luster would linger after the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is talking about trying to recapture that 'Olympic
magic,' but that just can't happen, on any level," said Spencer
Beckstead, a business student at the University of Utah. "We need to
let it go, and get back to being the same boring town that we've
always been."</TE>
<TE>   While Salt Lake did not transform itself into an international
tourism mecca, the city and state clearly benefited in other ways.
Utah gained a reputation for staging the famously difficult event
without a hitch. The region's magnificent ski terrain was showcased
perfectly. Volunteers were praised for their unflagging good cheer.</TE>
<TE>   Another local institution--the Mormon Church--also emerged with an
enhanced reputation. Many say a low-key education campaign during the
Olympics dispelled misconceptions about the religion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was so much that people had a prejudice about
Utah, I think they just didn't know anything about Utah," said Justin
Williams, who is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. "I think the Games helped deal with the misperceptions. If
nothing else, that's a plus."</TE>
<TE>   But Utah was hoping for far more than goodwill. After spending $59
million to build and upgrade winter sports venues, the state expects
that investment to be repaid with increased tourism and business
growth. During the Games, Gov. Mike Leavitt relentlessly schmoozed
high-tech investors and venture capitalists and came away with a
$120-million fund to develop biomedical and high-tech industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mistake to think we did all that work for just 17 days,"
said Natalie Hochner, Leavitt's spokeswoman. "Since the Games, we
have become a global brand. But we have to work our tails off to keep
the economy going."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, rather than blasting off, Utah's economy has fizzled.
According to recently released figures, passengers deplaning at Salt
Lake International Airport during February declined, compared to the
year before. Job growth in the state went down during the Olympic
period, despite the 1,000 positions created by the Salt Lake Olympic
Organizing Committee.</TE>
<TE>   And, preliminary figures show that the SLOOC surplus--which the
state would share--will be between $30 million and $40 million,
nothing like the $80 million some had projected.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most painful aspect of Salt Lake's Olympic hangover
has been the lack of economic punch for the city, especially the
depressed downtown.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, business owners reported that February was a windfall
month. The citywide hotel occupancy rate was 84%, compared to 66% in
the same month the year before. State and local sales tax revenue
increased 9% in February, and virtually every Main Street storefront
was leased.</TE>
<TE>   But since the Games, "Space Available" signs have popped up along
the mall. Suburban dwellers who surprised themselves by bringing
their families into town at night during the Games have gone back to
staying home.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really busy in February, which we expected, but we also
expected that some of it would carry over. It hasn't and it's a
bummer," said Chauncey Webb, owner of the Main Street Coffee House,
echoing the sentiments of dozens of business owners. "It's worse than
before. All our regulars aren't out and about. Our business has
really dropped off."</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake Mayor Rocky Anderson said he never claimed that the
Olympics would transform the staid downtown corridor into a hip
center of night life. But he did hope the Games would lure more
people back downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "Where we are now is that people saw the advantages of people from
diverse cultures coming together, they came downtown at night and it
was safe and there was parking and it was fun," Anderson said. "That
was a start. Trying to sustain that enthusiasm isn't easy."</TE>
<TE>   The city is sponsoring weekly downtown events, Anderson said, and
he's trying to persuade shop owners to extend their hours to capture
the night crowds. Bolstering these struggling businesses is a must,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just met with my city planner, and we all agree our No. 1
priority is 100% occupancy of Main Street," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Few expect to recapture that same festive atmosphere that
enveloped the city during the Games, but many think it's worth a try.</TE>
<TE>   "Look around, it's the middle of the day and it's dead here,"
complained Jo Stinson, a 20-something working at a coffee shop on
Main.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to know the best part of the Olympics? Saying to the
people that live here, 'Hello? This is what the rest of the world
looks like! Wake up!' There has been a definite drop in culture, you
could say that. Man, I miss that."</TE>

<HD>A Whale of a Quandary Stirs Seattle</HD>
<DH>An ailing, orphaned orca has the city divided over what
they can do to help</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Commuters riding the ferry between Seattle and Vashon Island have
been charmed by an orphaned killer whale plying the route for months,
diving alongside the lumbering ferry and preening for onlookers.</LD>
<LD>   The spectacle has been cause for alternate celebration and dread
in this town, which prizes its orcas even more than its coffee.
Celebration, because the spirited young whale is a symbol of
everything that is still untamed about this city by the sea. Dread,
because the orca is probably dying.</LD>
<LD>   The whale, known as A73, is separated from her pod, which normally
roams the coast of Canada, 400 miles to the north. She has an
advancing skin disease and probable metabolic problems, making it
unlikely she can survive for very long on her own alongside one of
the largest cities on the West Coast, biologists say.</LD>
<TE>   The orphan, whose antics have filled local news broadcasts since
January and have spurred countless public debates and letters,
appeared just as Seattle is facing a sharp decline in its local orca
population. Only last week, there were signs that the region's
trademark killer whales are suffering heavier industrial pollution
loads than ever imagined, including some of the highest levels of
toxic PCBs ever measured in orcas.</TE>
<TE>   "The orcas are a particularly effective indicator of the health of
the ecosystem, as well as being probably our most beloved creature,"
said Kathy Fletcher of People for Puget Sound, a citizens' group
working to restore the health of Seattle's famous waterway.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put toxins in the environment that are affecting the health
of the orca whales, and we have managed to have such an impact on
salmon that we are affecting their major food supply," Fletcher said.</TE>
<TE>   The black-and-white whales were shot at for years by fishermen
through the early part of the century and rounded up for aquariums
and sideshows in the 1960s and '70s (the most famous one being Namu,
exhibited at the Seattle Aquarium, and the subject of a movie and a
rock song before dying of an infection in his pen in 1966).</TE>
<TE>   Their numbers in southern Puget Sound rebounded in the early
1990s, then took a nose dive, declining 20% since 1996. The three
pods that are considered "resident" here, at least during the summer
months, went from 98 whales in 1996 to about 80 today.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Biological Diversity and several other groups have
petitioned to have the whales protected under the federal Endangered
Species Act and recently notified the government of its intent to sue
after the National Marine Fisheries Service this month missed a
deadline for acting on the petition.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the fisheries service said last week that it has test
results from a 22-foot female found dead near Dungeness Bay this
year--findings that show an astonishingly high level of industrial
PCBs, which tend to accumulate in the blubber.</TE>
<TE>   That whale was a transient, not one of Puget Sound's residents.
Unlike resident whales, which normally eat fish, transients tend to
feed on seals and porpoises, which, being higher up in the food
chain, tend to have bigger reserves of industrial pollutants in their
body fat. Still, the levels found in the dead orca are 20 times the
level that has been documented to cause reproductive problems and
immune dysfunction in animals like seals.</TE>
<TE>   "It was surprising," in part because the whale appeared otherwise
healthy and well fed, said John Stein, director of environmental
conservation for the federal government's Northwest Fisheries Science
Center. It was not known how she died.</TE>
<TE>   "You can find higher levels at times, but usually [among] whales
in poor condition.... This has helped us understand what the far end
of the spectrum can look like," Stein said.</TE>
<TE>   The findings also have scientists scratching their head because
the higher levels showed up in a female still in her reproductive
years. Normally, female whales pass on most of the toxins in their
bodies to their offspring through lactation. They caution that the
findings represent only one whale, and a dead one at that, and may
not be representative of all whales in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fletcher said, there has to be something wrong when so many
of the region's whales are disappearing without a trace, or washing
up dead on a beach, as a young male orca did on the southern
Washington coast in mid-April--or showing up alone and sick in urban
Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is A73 unique. Another orca, a member of one of southern Puget
Sound's resident pods, became separated from his pod and showed up in
a remote inlet off Canada's Vancouver Island last July.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say that whale appears much healthier than A73, whose
precarious condition has left government officials in a quandary
about whether to come to her aid--risking killing her from the stress
or dooming her to permanent captivity--or leave her alone and hope
for the best.</TE>
<TE>   Two camps have emerged.</TE>
<TE>   One side says A73 should be captured and moved in a net pen up to
Canada, brought back to prime health and reunited with her pod when
they show up there after their winter wanderings in late June. An
advisory panel of scientists recently favored that view, arguing
that, if the whale is going to be moved at all, it is important to do
it before she becomes sicker and while there is still a chance to
reunite with her own pod.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical thing is, if we don't do it in the next few weeks,
the window of opportunity for releasing her [near her pod] is going
to be closed," said Michael Kandu of the whale conservation group
SeaWolf. "She might be OK for the next one or two months, great. But
what happens in 10 months [when her pod has again left the area]?
They can't put her back in the wild then. They've basically doomed
her to life in captivity at that point."</TE>
<TE>   But the marine fisheries service, which has jurisdiction, has said
it is inclined to wait and see. While the skin disease could be
life-threatening, and the whale appears to have serious digestive
problems, A73 is feeding and does not seem to be in distress, the
agency said. A blood test was taken recently in the hope of gaining
more clues.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the scientists' recommendation, said NMFS
spokesman Brian Gorman, is that it does not say how anyone will know
when it is clearly time to give up on nature and move the whale.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fear is we'd end up with a sick whale on our hands that we
couldn't reintroduce into the wild," Gorman said. "That leaves us
with two choices: We could euthanize the whale or we could send it on
a one-way trip to a display facility. And those are both repugnant
choices. The prospects for this whale are not good, no matter what
happens."</TE>

<HD>Identity of 'Deep Throat' Is an Enduring Mystery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Nixon is dead, Katharine Graham is dead, even Linda Lovelace
is dead.</LD>
<LD>   But Deep Throat? Still alive, and still a secret more than a
quarter-century after his guidance helped Washington Post reporters
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein break the Watergate story and unseat
a president.</LD>
<LD>   John Dean says he knows Deep Throat's identity. And the former
White House counsel, whose testimony against Nixon was a key moment
in the saga, says he will reveal all in "The Deep Throat Brief." The
electronic book will be published June 17, the 30th anniversary of
the Watergate break-in.</LD>
<TE>   "He's pretty certain he knows who it is," said Scott Rosenberg,
managing editor of the online magazine Salon, which will offer Dean's
book.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Dean was pretty certain in 1975, when he said Deep
Throat was Earl J. Silbert, a Watergate prosecutor. And he was pretty
certain in 1982, when he named Alexander M. Haig, who was Nixon's
chief of staff and Ronald Reagan's secretary of State.</TE>
<TE>   Silbert and Haig denied it. This is to be expected. Everyone
denies being Deep Throat. Including, Woodward says, Deep Throat.</TE>
<TE>   The shadowy source "was risking a great deal personally and
professionally," he said in 1997. Washington cannot abide a secret,
especially one Dean has called "the best-kept secret in the history
of the capital." So while the particulars of Deep Throat's exploits
have faded in memory for many Americans, for others--politicians,
historians and journalists--speculation about his identity remains a
favorite parlor game.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon was not immune. Monica Crowley, a young aide to the former
president for four years before his death in 1994, quoted Nixon as
saying Deep Throat was "someone on the inside.... One person who
thought he had a lot to gain by spilling his guts to those two guys,"
someone who wanted to be seen as a liberal because he wanted "a media
career."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the public only came to know Deep Throat through "All the
President's Men," the 1974 book by Woodward and Bernstein, and
through the 1976 film based on the book in which the source was
played by Hal Holbrook.</TE>
<TE>   "Woodward had a source in the executive branch who had access to
information at [the Committee to Re-Elect the President] as well as
at the White House. His identity was unknown to anyone else," the
book says.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward promised he would never identify the source or quote him,
even anonymously.</TE>

<HD>Met Closes Out Its Season Sans an Ailing Pavarotti</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Luciano Pavarotti kept his fans guessing until the last minute
Saturday before announcing he was too ill with the flu to perform at
the Metropolitan Opera's season finale.</LD>
<LD>   The singer's withdrawal from the performance of Puccini's "Tosca"
seemed to signal that the curtain had fallen on his Met career, which
began in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   Met general manager Joseph Volpe said Pavarotti told him Saturday
afternoon that he would perform, then called back two hours later to
say he would not. Volpe said he asked Pavarotti to appear even if he
could not sing and was told, "I cannot do that."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, Pavarotti, 66, canceled his appearance in the
same opera at the last minute, citing poor health. He has no
engagements scheduled at the Met after this season, although he
remains scheduled for future arena concerts and recitals.</TE>
<TE>   For Saturday night, the company was taking no chances, especially
with nonrefundable ticket prices ranging from $75 to $1,875--up from
the usual $30 to $265--and a live simulcast planned on a giant screen
in the Lincoln Center plaza.</TE>
<TE>   As a backup, the management flew in Italian tenor Salvatore
Licitra on the Concorde from Europe. He received a 43-second ovation
at the conclusion of his first big aria, "Recondita Armonia."</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty over Pavarotti created a buzz more commonly
associated with rock or movie stars.</TE>
<TE>   "Fat Man Won't Sing," blared the front-page headline in the New
York Post on Friday. The New York Times quoted an acquaintance
Saturday as saying the ailing tenor was "barricaded in his apartment
... on Central Park South taking medication and cooking a 7-pound
chicken for soup."</TE>

<HD>UAL Ground Workers OK Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines ground workers approved a labor agreement early
Saturday that settles the carrier's last unresolved contract and
clears the way for talks on companywide wage concessions.</LD>
<LD>   The pact calls for pay raises totaling 29% over four years for
United's 25,000 ramp workers, ticket and reservation agents, security
guards and food-service employees.</LD>
<LD>   Union leaders had unanimously recommended ratification.</LD>
<TE>   The contract, hammered out last month, gives the ground workers
their first raises since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   United's pilots, mechanics and aircraft cleaners already have
received hefty raises during a turbulent two-year period for the
airline. But the carrier wants them to give some back to help it cut
costs and pull out of the worst financial troubles in its history.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Officer Jack Creighton has been involved in talks
with union leaders to implement a financial recovery program that may
include temporary pay cuts.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to convene more talks soon, this time including the
International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which had
refused to participate until the ground workers' deal is ratified.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Frank Larkin said the union has agreed to meet
with company officials once they have a proposal for wage concessions
or other actions.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was too early to say what moves might be necessary to
help the struggling carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton has said he wants to nail down an agreement with United
employees before retiring in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Employees own 55% of the carrier and hold three board seats.</TE>
<TE>   The airline has recently been losing $4 million to $5 million a
day.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Hope Tiny Ripples in Space Will Unlock Big
Secrets</HD>
<DH>Research: Astronomers have technology to detect waves
formed by huge explosions, which could reveal new details about the
universe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHLAND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>This summer, two observatories in the United States begin their
search for gravitational waves from outer space, looking for evidence
of black holes, neutron stars and supernovas.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe even remnants of the Big Bang, the great cosmic explosion
that might have given birth to the universe 15 billion years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a new window on the universe," said Beverly Berger, program
director for gravitational physics at the National Science Foundation
in Arlington, Va.</LD>
<TE>   "In the past, whenever astronomers have opened a new window,
they've seen something unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   Cosmic cataclysms are believed to produce ripples--gravitational
waves--that travel at the speed of light in the fabric of space and
time, but so far no one's seen them.</TE>
<TE>   The effect researchers are looking for is similar to that of a
rock being dropped into water, with the ripples diminishing in size
the farther they get from the spot where the rock fell.</TE>
<TE>   It's essentially an emerging area of physics and astronomy, but it
builds on a nearly century-old idea: Albert Einstein predicted the
existence of gravitational waves with his general theory of
relativity in 1916.</TE>
<TE>   Almost a century later, scientists believe the precision
technology finally exists to find them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for very violent events where space gets
disrupted," said physicist Fred Raab, director of the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) at Hanford
nuclear reservation in south-central Washington.</TE>
<TE>   LIGO Hanford works in tandem with LIGO Livingston, 1,877 miles
away, at a site just east of Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   Raab compares LIGO to a big microphone "listening" for
gravitational waves with equipment that can convert those waves to
audible signals.</TE>
<TE>   While researchers are reasonably certain that the waves exist,
they don't know if the LIGO detector will be able to see them, Raab
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime this summer, they'll turn on the lasers and wait.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists believe that the initial system might detect waves,
Raab said, and a more advanced system, which could be up and running
by 2008, should detect them.</TE>
<TE>   The cosmic explosions--collisions of black holes or the blasts of
a supernova--happen hundreds of millions of light-years away, so the
gravitational waves would be extremely faint.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't happen nearby typically, which is a good thing,
because it would destroy us," Raab said.</TE>
<TE>   Black holes are collapsed stars so dense that not even light can
escape their gravity.</TE>
<TE>   Much larger supermassive black holes are believed to occupy the
centers of galaxies, where they swallow hundreds of thousands of
stars.</TE>
<TE>   "LIGO gives us information that we don't have access to any other
way, things like black holes, things we can only infer from the light
we see," Berger said.</TE>
<TE>   Here in the sagebrush desert, the interferometer is made up of a
pair of 2.5-mile-long vacuum tubes that jut at right angles from a
central building where a laser bounces light off specially designed
mirrors that will help catch and reflect the minute vibrations of
gravitational waves.</TE>
<TE>   The waves are so small they are expected to move the mirrors by
one-thousandth of a fermi, a measurement less than a trillionth of
the diameter of a human hair.</TE>
<TE>   The two observatories were built to work together, a means of
confirming gravitational waves amid the vibrational noise of the
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   It is less likely that two sites separated by almost 2,000 miles
would detect false signals at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Other interferometers are being constructed in Europe and one is
operating in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-year-old LIGO project has cost $372 million so far and is
funded by the National Science Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   It is operated by Caltech and MIT.</TE>

<HD>Indians Protest Nev. Nuclear Dump</HD>
<DH>Activism: Western Shoshone tribe members say the plans for
waste disposal at Yucca Mountain involve their native lands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MERCURY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Members of the Western Shoshone tribe gathered at the entrance to the
Nevada Test Site Saturday to protest the proposed nuclear waste dump
at Yucca Mountain.</LD>
<LD>   Nevada's Paiute and Western Shoshone tribes have staunchly opposed
the government's plans to dispose of nuclear waste on their native
lands.</LD>
<LD>   About 30 Western Shoshone members, nine of whom ran a 250-mile
relay from their reservation in central Nevada to the Nevada Test
Site, were joined by about 100 Yucca Mountain protesters.</LD>
<TE>   "My legs were feeling it, but it was spiritual and uplifting,"
Santiago Lozada of Davis, Calif., said of the relay. "I felt the
sorrow of our ancestors."</TE>
<TE>   The tribe prayed, sang and danced at a "peace camp" outside the
Nevada Test Site entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The group planned to camp overnight and then Yucca protesters will
cross the boundary line of the Nevada Test Site today.</TE>
<TE>   "There are medicine rocks and artifacts on the top of the mountain
and in caves," said Johnnie Bobb, tribe spiritual leader from Austin,
Nev. "Now we can't even go in there. They keep us out."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. House on Wednesday overwhelmingly embraced President
Bush's decision to bury tens of thousands of tons of nuclear waste at
Yucca Mountain, 90 miles from Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The next showdown will come in the Senate, which must decide by
July whether to override a Nevada veto of the project.</TE>

<LD>South Korea was slaughtering 7,300 pigs after detecting
foot-and-mouth disease at four farms south of Seoul--a finding that
sparked fears that the ailment could spread further despite efforts
to halt an outbreak discovered last week.</LD>
<LD>   The Agriculture Ministry said several ailing pigs were found at
the farms in Ansung and Yongin, both 60 miles south of the capital
and about a mile from two farms where authorities slaughtered nearly
12,000 pigs a week ago.</LD>

<HD>Israel Delays Gaza Assault; Thousands Rally for Peace</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Tanks and troops remain arrayed along the border
after media quotes military officials questioning wisdom of an
attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Israeli leftists rallied Saturday night to demand that
Ariel Sharon make peace with the Palestinians, while the Israeli
prime minister, under pressure, delayed a planned military attack on
the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   With Israeli retaliation for a devastating suicide bombing Tuesday
widely anticipated, tanks and troops remained arrayed along Israel's
border with the Gaza Strip. But they held off launching an assault,
at least for the time being.</LD>
<LD>   The delay came after Israeli newspapers reported details of the
planned operation and quoted senior army officers questioning its
wisdom.</LD>
<TE>   The Israeli army regards its just-concluded six-week offensive in
the West Bank as a successful campaign to uproot terrorists. But
invading the densely populated Gaza Strip, where about 1.2 million
people live cramped in refugee camps and overgrown towns, is seen as
a far more dangerous and potentially deadly mission.</TE>
<TE>   Gaza is the headquarters of Hamas, the radical Islamic
organization that has engineered numerous suicide bombings and might
have been responsible for the most recent one. Hamas operatives and
other Gaza-based militants have had ample time to prepare for an
Israeli invasion--undoubtedly a consideration taken into account by
the army. And the top suspects whom Israel seeks have been able to go
into hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Facing U.S. and European Pressure</TE>
<TE>   In addition to facing the extra complexity that a Gaza attack
would involve, Sharon is under pressure from the U.S. and Europe to
allow a new diplomatic drive, sponsored by Washington and Arab
states, to make headway toward peace.</TE>
<TE>   Launching another large-scale military offensive after the massive
West Bank effort would risk being seen as excessive, Israeli analysts
said. With the end of the 39-day standoff at Bethlehem's Church of
the Nativity on Friday, the army withdrew from that city and the West
Bank operation formally came to a close.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon does not want to upset what he sees as a favorable
diplomatic climate following his meeting last week with a sympathetic
President Bush, aides to the prime minister said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether the suicide bomber who struck Tuesday
night at a pool hall in suburban Tel Aviv, killing 15 Israelis, came
from Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve soldiers were called up last week in preparation for an
assault on Gaza. Those orders followed a call-up of more than 20,000
soldiers for the West Bank operation, which caused widespread
destruction and civilian suffering in Palestinian cities and came
after suicide bombings that killed dozens of Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The West Bank offensive "was perceived as a no-choice campaign,
and the emergency call-up was perceived as a necessity," commentator
Amir Oren wrote in this weekend's Haaretz newspaper. "The Gaza
campaign is seen in a completely different light, a campaign of
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Although that choice might be forgone for now, no one is ruling it
out altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt Welcomes Israeli Decision</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli decision to hold off in Gaza was welcomed in Egypt,
where President Hosni Mubarak was meeting with Saudi and Syrian
leaders to discuss ways out of the Mideast conflict, news reports
from Cairo said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obvious that there is an Israeli reconsideration to the
decision ... to attack Gaza," Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher
said. "We don't say that the danger is over, but we say that there is
more realization [of] the gravity of such an adventure."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Sharon faces a crucial meeting of the central committee of
his right-wing Likud Party, which is demanding even tougher action
against the Palestinians. Committee members are expected to try to
push through a binding resolution opposing the creation of a
Palestinian state, which would prohibit the prime minister from
negotiating one.</TE>
<TE>   Leftist Rally Draws Tens of Thousands</TE>
<TE>   Israeli leftists, meanwhile, staged their biggest rally in almost
20 months of intense Israeli- Palestinian violence. Police estimates
put the number of demonstrators at about 50,000. Peace Now, the group
that organized the event, said there were more than 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gathering in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square, named for Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated there in 1995, the crowd demanded
complete Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza and the
evacuation of Jewish settlements.</TE>
<TE>   "Leave the territories, for the sake of Israel," banners read. The
Israeli left has been all but silenced in recent months by the
fighting and the sense shared by many Israelis that the Palestinians
cannot be partners for peace. Saturday night's rally represented an
attempt at a comeback, with a shift of focus to ending occupation and
dismantling settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Yaffa Yarkoni, one of Israel's preeminent singers--who recently
got in hot water for sympathizing with reservist soldiers who refuse
to serve in the West Bank and Gaza--performed at the rally despite a
reported death threat.</TE>
<TE>   Yarkoni wept as she left the stage after singing for an end to
war. "Is it possible, I hope it will be, that it will happen already.
I am tired of these things," she told Israeli radio. "I am tired of
these wars. Let [peace] come already."</TE>

<HD>Jordan's Transformation Is a Victim of Mideast Turmoil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>King Abdullah II of Jordan dreams big. After he inherited the throne
three years ago, the former special forces commando designed an
ambitious program to help his oil-less desert kingdom leapfrog
centuries using technology and political reform.</LD>
<LD>   His agenda included high-tech centers to teach Bedouin nomads and
impoverished villagers--many of whom had never even seen a
typewriter--how to get wired.</LD>
<LD>   The impact was soon visible as the government accelerated a
painful and occasionally noisy transition. Jordan now brags that it
has more computer programmers than Ireland, and its economic growth
last year was 4.2%--the highest in the Arab world.</LD>
<TE>   But today that transformation is on virtual hold--and even faces
reversals, as the king acknowledged in a series of interviews during
a day trip from Washington to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, 40, hasn't lost his boyish enthusiasm, but both the
Net-surfing king and his conservative tribal society are increasingly
victims of the Mideast crisis next door. And the cost since the
current Palestinian intifada began 19 months ago is anguishing for a
nation that is one of only two Arab countries to have made peace with
Israel but that is also at least half Palestinian.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of opening up to create a new model for the last bloc of
countries to hold out against the democratic tide, Jordan has instead
suspended parliament, postponed elections, blocked demonstrations,
and arrested protesters and journalists. Government officials blame
the regional turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   So now Abdullah--son of King Hussein, who made Jordan one of the
Arab world's few stable countries during his half-century rule--is
dreaming big again, this time about peace.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two months, he has become a central figure among
moderate Arab leaders who are for the first time talking about a full
and final peace with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys have done more in two months than the entire Arab
world has done in the past 20 years," said a senior State Department
official who requested anonymity. "This is one of the signs that
gives us hope that something might actually happen this time around."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah gets special kudos from the White House. "He is a leader
among leaders in his work to bring peace to the region," said Sean
McCormick, a National Security Council spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   But that work is taking a toll on the king, who is now under
pressure from all sides.</TE>
<TE>   The peace treaty with Israel, signed in 1994, is increasingly
controversial at home. Anti-American sentiment is also mounting in
the country, which has been a more consistent U.S. ally than any
other Arab state. And the sieges in Ramallah and Bethlehem and the
devastation of the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, which was
part of Jordan until 1967, have sparked protests--some of which the
king's riot police had to put down.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging public opinion, Queen Rania led a peaceful protest
march through the capital, Amman, last month. Rania, who was in
computer marketing until she met the king a decade ago, is the
daughter of a prominent Palestinian family from Tulkarm, another West
Bank city raided during the Israeli military operations.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the United States wants Abdullah to contain the
violence and persuade hard-line Arab leaders to end support of
radical groups. And Israel is pressing him to rein in Islamic
militants.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah is candid about the challenges--and his response.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a crisis and people are angry and frustrated, you
have to be sterner with your people so things can't get out of
control. I'm sure there's a graph of different countries about how
draconian they've had to be with their societies. Some countries have
had to be very tough. I like to think we're on the lower end of the
graph," he explained in a rare interview aboard his Royal Airbus.</TE>
<TE>   But in intensive talks all week at the White House, the State
Department, the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill during his 10-day U.S.
tour, the king also warned of the potential dangers the longer
hostilities drag on.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the Americans to understand that whenever you have to be
tough on your society, you're paying a price you'll have to deal with
later," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The king said his message was as important for an American
audience as for his 5 million subjects.</TE>
<TE>   About three-quarters of the Mideast population is young and, in
the Information Age, is being saturated with images of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the venom of hatred, he said.
Without imminent resolution, there's a growing danger of losing that
generation to extremism, with a ripple effect that would spill well
beyond the Mideast's borders.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine the horror if we lose that 75% of the Arab
population to extremism? Not only does it destroy all my hopes for
the future of my country, but it definitely will affect the future
and interests of the West and the United States. I don't want to
frighten people about Sept. 11 scenarios, but if you have a militant
region, it's going to take decades to fix," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were Osama bin Laden now and I originally thought I'd lost,
I'd be coming out of my cave and thinking, 'Ah, maybe I have a chance
now.'"</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah gained public respect in the early days of his rule when
he disguised himself and showed up at various government
facilities--from hospitals and welfare offices to the internal
revenue service--to see how well they served him as an ordinary
citizen. At Jordan's internal revenue service, he actually managed to
walk into an office and walk away with several files.</TE>
<TE>   The king doesn't have time for his one-man investigations anymore.
He's now absorbed in trying to expedite the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I have so many gray hairs in my beard. I didn't have
them three years ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He's also off caffeine because he's having trouble sleeping. And
his anguish worsens every time he hears about another Palestinian
suicide bombing or Israeli military retaliation. He was in Washington
preparing for his Oval Office visit when he heard about the bombing
Tuesday in a pool hall near Tel Aviv that killed 15 Israelis and
injured dozens. He threw his head into his hands. "Oh, no," he
remembers saying. "This is crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The outside world isn't helping Jordan's plight much either. In
the king's 40-minute meeting with President Bush, 37 minutes were
spent on the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "That's usually the case now. In any meeting, the majority of the
time is spent on the conflict and the remaining time on Iraq. And
then, when I'm walking out the door it's, 'Oh, we have a debt relief
problem, and can you help us,'" he added, as he talked aboard his
plane en route to Houston to give a speech--on the Mideast conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In his address, at Rice University, Abdullah called for the
creation of a global "peace alliance" to foster a new approach to
settling the conflict. Its goal, he said, should be a plan to ensure
that the security, economic and political needs of both Israel and
the Palestinians are met--and guaranteed to endure. "The deal must
aim for the finish line--not the halfway markers, not the rules for
pit stops," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The previous approach of phased steps, with an undefined outcome,
has run its course because the current crisis has left the world's
most volatile region "at ground zero," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Both peoples are exhausted and are ready for a peace that will
allow an Israeli mother to send her child on an errand to the local
supermarket without fear, a peace that will allow a Palestinian
mother to deliver her newborn, alive, at a hospital and not at an
Israeli roadblock," said the king, referring to two recent episodes
that led to deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The new peace alliance should pick up, he said, on the initiative
sponsored by Saudi Arabia and passed by the Arab League in March,
offering Israel an end to war plus normalized relations and trade
with all 21 member countries in exchange for the return of lands
occupied since the 1967 Middle East War. And it should move as
quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   During the speech, Abdullah won a standing ovation when he said,
"Far too much is at stake to go on as we are. The wake-up alarm has
rung."</TE>

<HD>After Seven Years, Quebec Has Lost Its Separatist Itch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Danielle Dubois, a Roman Catholic nun from an old Quebec family,
works at a shrine devoted to her order's 17th century founder, an
icon of Quebec nationalism.</LD>
<LD>   Sister Danielle has long been a reliable vote for the independence
movement here--but no more.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't like separatism now," she said firmly, locking the doors
at the church of Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours. She gets along well with
the English speakers in her convent, she said, and has come to
believe that "we can get along with the rest of Canada the same way."</LD>
<TE>   In 1995, Quebec stunned the rest of the country when it came
within a percentage point of embracing sovereignty. Now Quebec's
independence movement appears to be sliding into steep and perhaps
terminal decline.</TE>
<TE>   The party that was separatism's driving force is reeling from a
string of recent election defeats, and polls show that most
Quebecers--like Sister Danielle--are less and less inclined to
challenge Canadian federal rule.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasm for independence peaked a decade ago, when two-thirds
of the population backed a break with Canada; today, barely
two-fifths want to sever the Ottawa link, with support eroding most
notably among younger French speakers. "Something has snapped," said
Alain Gagnon, the director of the Quebec Studies program at McGill
University here.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Quebec's most prominent independence
crusaders have died or retired, and a fixation on the unresolved
conflict with Ottawa suddenly seems retrograde, analysts on both
sides say.</TE>
<TE>   Quebecers still want full control of fiscal and social policies,
still bridle at loyalty oaths to the queen, and still prefer their
blue fleur-de-lis to the red Canadian maple leaf.</TE>
<TE>   But a new generation of entrepreneurs, artists and opinion-makers
here is looking beyond Canada for its challenges and opportunities,
and politicians who preach the separatist gospel are facing
unaccustomed rejection.</TE>
<TE>   The Parti Quebecois, the independence champion that has governed
the province for most of the last 25 years, was soundly defeated in
all eight by-elections held in the last year, including three last
month. Local polls now show Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien's
Liberal Party with a commanding 10- to 15-percentage-point lead over
the Quebecois party, which must call new provincial elections next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Most crushing was last month's loss in Saguenay, a rural
northeastern district that had led the province in separatist
sentiment and was long a Parti Quebecois stronghold. The PQ, as it is
commonly known, was trounced in Saguenay by a small, nominally
separatist faction that says independence shouldn't be considered for
another decade or more.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at the end of an era--an era dominated by the question of
separation and Quebec independence," declared Pierre Pettigrew,
Canada's staunchly federalist international trade minister, who is a
Quebec native and a leader of the Liberal Party here.</TE>
<TE>   For 40 years, Quebec's resistance to federal rule has been the
central issue of both provincial and national politics. But now most
Quebecers--including the province's 75% French-speaking
majority--appear to be tiring of the dispute. And the new immigrants
upon whom Quebec depends to counteract its plummeting birthrate are
adamantly against separation from Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the obituaries for the independence movement may be
premature. In 1976, then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau famously
declared separatism "dead."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the PQ roared into power and engineered the first
referendum on independence, which lost by 10 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   After the Liberals regained control of the provincial government
for two terms, the PQ stormed back and again put independence on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "We should never make a judgment on whether separatism is alive or
dead, because it is something that surfaces depending on
circumstances," said John Parella, an English-speaking Liberal Party
activist here. "The level of separatism rises when Quebecers feel
that they have been shortchanged or mistreated."</TE>
<TE>   But the slights of the past are receding. Quebec's French-speaking
majority has long since asserted its political and cultural
dominance--a reality immediately evident in this self-confident,
cosmopolitan city.</TE>
<TE>   "Younger people don't need to fight for the nation anymore,
because it already exists in their minds," McGill University's Gagnon
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of Quebec's corporate managers are native French
speakers, according to business surveys; 40 years ago, it was barely
half that. And English speakers and French speakers alike are much
more likely to be fluently bilingual today--even as street signs and
advertisements have become French alone.</TE>
<TE>   The relocation of some prominent firms from Montreal to Toronto
has been more than compensated for by the growth of local export
industries, from Bombardier, which makes subway cars, to
Hydro-Quebec, a major supplier of New York's electricity. Quebec,
more than any other province, has become a true NAFTA economy,
earning as much from sales in the U.S. and Mexico as it does from the
rest of Canada. Per capita income is fast approaching that of
Ontario, Canada's highest.</TE>
<TE>   With the North American Free Trade Agreement pulling Quebec into a
bigger economic universe, the drive for formal independence "has lost
its significance for many people," said Michelle Rioux, an expert in
the local political economy at the University of Quebec at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Quebec's increasing cultural and economic autonomy "removes the
sense of emergency" from its separatist quest, acknowledged
Jean-Francois Lisee, a University of Montreal professor who was an
architect of the 1995 referendum on independence.</TE>
<TE>   An equally important change, Lisee said, is that the province is
no longer ethnically polarized: Marriage across linguistic (and
religious) lines is now commonplace, and the 10% of the populace that
is English-speaking is outnumbered by immigrants who speak neither
English nor French as their first language.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many independence supporters say Quebec has proved that it
could be viable as a sovereign nation--something Quebecers themselves
once doubted.</TE>
<TE>   "With all this cultural vitality, with all this economic success,
why not go all the way?" said Louise Beaudoin, Quebec's minister for
international relations, who oversees a network of quasi-embassies in
the Americas and Europe. "When I see Slovenia and Slovakia in the
U.N., I think, 'What about us?'"</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if separatism should crest again, it would take on a new,
more pragmatic shape, advocates say. They speak of a continued
"partnership" or "association" with Canada that would include open
borders, a common currency, joint defense arrangements and foreign
policy coordination.</TE>
<TE>   Quebec cannot change its relationship to Canada without Canada's
consent, the Supreme Court ruled in 1998--providing that Ottawa
conducts good-faith consultations with Quebec over the terms of any
proposed separation. And most Canadians say they do not want Quebec
to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Canadian identity is too fragile to eliminate that part
of it that is not entirely Canadian," Lisee said. "Without Quebec,
Canada is much more American."</TE>

<HD>Harbor Area Bid to Secede Shaken</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Commission says San Pedro and Wilmington would
face millions in deficits as a city. Placing the issue on November's
ballot appears unlikely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN, PATRICK McGREEVY and LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The harbor region of Los Angeles would not survive financially if it
split off from the rest of the city, a state analysis concluded
Saturday, dealing a major setback to those who hope to place a
secession proposal for the area on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The executive officer of the Local Agency Formation Commission,
who has backed the breakaway movement by the San Fernando Valley,
determined that a harbor area city, population 145,000, would
immediately be saddled by budget deficits, and recommended that a
secession election for the waterfront area not be held.</LD>
<LD>   By state law, the commission cannot authorize a secession vote for
a region that would not be financially sound on its own.</LD>
<TE>   LAFCO is set to decide next month whether to place the harbor
cityhood proposal on the ballot. Commissioners on Saturday did not
rule out finding a way to hold a harbor election, but the negative
conclusions reached by LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine will
make that task difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "If LAFCO follows the law, I do not see how it could put harbor
secession on the ballot," said Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading
the fight against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "The new LAFCO study confirms what I have said from the beginning:
Harbor secession is bad for harbor residents and the rest of the
city," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who lives in San Pedro, added: "Secession of any part of the
city is too expensive and too risky."</TE>
<TE>   But Andrew Mardesich, who heads the harbor secession movement,
said he will challenge Calemine's numbers before the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at this in disbelief," Mardesich said of the report.
"It's not over yet.... This is the ninth round of a 10-round fight."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's report undermines an important element of the
three-front secession drive that began five years ago and has drawn
increasing attention in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO also is considering placing secession proposals for the San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists believe that each proposal would get more votes if
all three breakaway bids appeared on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   To win, a cityhood measure must carry a majority of votes within
the secession area and a majority of Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   If the harbor proposal dies, some observers and anti-secessionists
say, fewer cityhood proponents in that area will go to the polls in
November and vote for a Valley or Hollywood measure.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, overall, it helps the city stay together," said
Councilwoman Janice Hahn, a secession opponent who has offered as an
alternative to municipal breakup the creation of a borough system in
some ways resembling that of New York City. "In my opinion, harbor
area people would have less to get out and vote for."</TE>
<TE>   Breakup advocates, however, say that if harbor voters are denied
the opportunity to create their own city, they might cast ballots in
favor of Valley or Hollywood secession as a form of protest.</TE>
<TE>   "If that kind of injustice occurs, the people in the harbor will
be madder than hell and would come together to help us get the
votes," said Gene La Pietra, a founder of the Hollywood secession
movement.</TE>
<TE>   The three secession proposals grew out of petition drives that
collected the signatures of 25% of the voters in each area.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the efforts have tested Los Angeles' sense of itself,
pitting those who see the city as too big to be manageable against
the city's political leadership and others who worry about the social
and political consequences of a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is by far the largest region seeking to leave, with a
population of 1.35 million. The Hollywood area is home to about
200,000.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginnings of the secession campaigns, the harbor's
financial viability has been deemed the most problematic.</TE>
<TE>   A waterfront city would have a $7.5-million deficit during its
first six months, with a budget of about $100 million, according to
Calemine's report. Under the rosiest scenario, a harbor city would be
$4 million in debt by the end of its second year.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, an initial LAFCO analysis of the harbor's
finances indicated that a new municipality would start in the red
unless it significantly cut services or boosted taxes. A later report
by state Controller Kathleen Connell went even further, flatly
stating that the area would not be financially viable as a city.</TE>
<TE>   Decision on Port Was Another Blow</TE>
<TE>   The harbor proposal was further damaged by a State Lands
Commission decision last month to remove the Port of Los Angeles from
the secession area's boundaries. That denied the proposed city about
$18 million in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   By analyzing new budget figures submitted by Mardesich, LAFCO
planners found that a harbor city could indeed reduce expenditures,
saving about $21 million a year by modeling itself after small to
mid-size cities instead of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   If the city contracted with Los Angeles County--rather than the
city of Los Angeles--for services such as police, fire protection,
libraries and animal control, for example, the budget gap would be
only about $6 million a year, the Calemine report said.</TE>
<TE>   But for the first six months of its existence, the new city would
have to buy those services from Los Angeles to avoid disruption. And
that would put it $7.5 million in the red right out of the box.</TE>
<TE>   Even after that, the $6-million annual deficit would be difficult
to close, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility, the report suggested, would be for a harbor city
to borrow funds from Los Angeles to cover the first year's deficits.
But that would provide only enough money to fund a reserve of
$157,000 the first year.</TE>
<TE>   "Under no scenario ... did the executive officer find that the
proposed city could generate reasonable reserves during its first
three years," Calemine wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Himself a former pro-secession activist, Calemine said he worked
hard to salvage the harbor proposal, redoing the commission's fiscal
analysis at the last minute to accommodate fresh numbers submitted by
secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's possible or practical, we'd like to put it on the
ballot," said LAFCO Chairman Henri Pellissier. He said he needed a
day to read the report before discussing its details.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have left us some openings," Pellissier said of Calemine.</TE>
<TE>   Sentiments behind the harbor secession drive date back decades.
San Pedro and Wilmington, settled by generations of Italian, Slavic
and Latino immigrants, were once their own cities, joining Los
Angeles in 1909.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, hungry for the region's port, had promised better
services for the fishing community, a new highway and harbor
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the area's proximity to the Port of Los Angeles means that
it grapples with pollution, and residents do not have a nearby
shopping mall. Cities depend heavily on property, sales and business
tax revenues to pay their bills.</TE>
<TE>   The area's relative geographical isolation only adds to the sense
of alienation from the rest of the city. The harbor is connected to
Los Angeles by a slim, rat's tail of city land annexed to ensure that
the harbor was physically attached to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro is one of the oldest communities in the state.</TE>
<TE>   With decisions affecting their lives being made 26 miles to the
north in Los Angeles City Hall, many people in the working-class port
communities have been disappointed with elected officials' responses
to local concerns about open space, air pollution, congestion and
truck traffic.</TE>
<TE>   If harbor cityhood doesn't make the ballot, said secessionist Noel
Park, "We are doomed."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a LAFCO commissioner
who has not taken a position on secession, said she understands the
frustrations of harbor residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that it's so isolated and it's connected by just a
little strip makes really a very strong argument for secession," she
said. "But I don't know how you can make it if you don't have any
money."</TE>

<HD>Davis Used Capitol to Seek Funds, Union Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, whose written policies warn aides against mixing
policy and politics, used his Capitol office and had a top government
aide with him when he requested a $1-million campaign donation from
the California Teachers Assn., people who attended the Valentine's
Day meeting said.</LD>
<LD>   California Teachers Assn. President Wayne Johnson said Davis made
the solicitation during a talk that focused primarily on policy
issues.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson said in two interviews with The Times that he doesn't
believe the governor was soliciting money in exchange for support of
any union legislation. But the former high school teacher and others
at the meeting said they were taken aback that Davis mentioned
campaign money in his private Capitol office.</LD>
<TE>   "We were talking about various kinds of things, legislation and
problems," Johnson said. "In the middle of the conversation, sort of
out of the blue, he said, 'I need $1 million from you guys.' "</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he, along with two other union officers and the
union's governmental affairs director, responded with "absolute stone
silence." Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy, one of Davis' closest
advisors, also said nothing, Johnson recalled. Once the "awkward
silence" ended, the discussion returned to policy matters and the
meeting ended without resolution of the question of campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   State law bars officials from actually accepting campaign checks
in the Capitol but does not prevent them from asking for money on
state property. Still, many elected officials in Sacramento decline
to discuss donations when they are in the statehouse, preferring to
make such requests while at campaign offices scattered near the
Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' initial solicitation in the Capitol did not end the
conversation, according to Johnson. Two weeks later, Johnson and
Davis appeared together at a Compton school event to encourage
students to read, Johnson said. After their public appearance, Davis
invited Johnson to a private one-on-one meeting in a Compton Unified
School District office.</TE>
<TE>   During that meeting, which occurred a few days before the March 5
primary, Davis told Johnson that the main GOP gubernatorial
candidates, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and the ultimate
nominee, Bill Simon Jr., would be bad for public education.</TE>
<TE>   "He was running late," Johnson said. "There were people outside
who wanted him to go, and he just kept talking.... Again, he said, 'I
need $1 million from CTA.'"</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's comments underscore a deepening rift between Davis and a
union that is among California's biggest campaign donors and was one
of Davis' biggest backers in 1998. In addition, the question of the
governor's use of the Capitol for raising money adds to the mounting
list of fund-raising issues that Davis is confronting as he runs for
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Already, he and his staff are dealing with criticism relating to
contracts with state prison guards and a number of computer firms--in
each case, groups that received state money and that donated to
Davis' campaign committee.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign strategist Garry South declined to discuss
Johnson's comments directly, but said the governor has met many times
with the union's leaders, "including twice at his home for dinner, at
his campaign office, at his Capitol office" and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "During some of those conversations," South added, "CTA offered an
endorsement and inquired about how they could provide other
assistance in the governor's reelection campaign. The governor
recalls those brief discussions, but has no recollection of exactly
where they occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a question about the conversations, Davis last week
said: "I don't recall it. I can't tell you with certainty that I
didn't make a request."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson first discussed the solicitation in an April 20 speech to
the 760-member teacher union's leadership council, and some aspects
of it were reported earlier this month in the San Francisco
Chronicle. Without mentioning where the request was made, Johnson
cited in that speech Davis' opposition to the union's top priority
for the year, legislation to make textbooks and other classroom
issues subject to collective bargaining. Davis' education advisors
have been unanimous in their opposition to the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "He opposes this crucial piece of legislation at the same time he
hounds CTA for a million-dollar contribution to his campaign for
reelection," Johnson said in the speech.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, Johnson said that he doubted
Davis' opposition to the bill was based on the union's balking at
giving him $1 million. "I honestly believe we could have given him $2
million, and he still would have taken a position against us,"
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's disclosure comes after Davis forced Arun Baheti to
resign as director of e-government earlier this month. Baheti had
accepted a $25,000 donation on Davis' behalf last year from a
lobbyist for Oracle Corp., shortly after Oracle won a $95-million
software contract with the state.</TE>
<TE>   When he announced Baheti's resignation, Davis released internal
codes of conduct cautioning gubernatorial aides against becoming
involved in political affairs while on state time. One such memo,
dated Jan. 29, said that although appointees can engage in political
activities off-hours, "political activities cannot involve any use of
state resources other than an incidental or minimal use, such as the
referral of unsolicited mail ... to proper political organizations."</TE>
<TE>   "We must make every effort," the memo concluded, "to distinguish
between official state functions performed with state resources, and
private political activities that cannot be supported with public
funds."</TE>
<TE>   In a second memo, called "Standards of Ethical Conduct," Davis
told his appointees that they may not use "the prestige or influence
of a state office for the appointee's private gain or advantage, or
the private gain or advantage of another."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' aides, without saying Davis made a solicitation while on
government property, noted that asking for money while in a
taxpayer-funded office is not illegal. But others say that given the
power a governor wields, a chief executive who prospects for money
while sitting face-to-face with donors in his private office gains
significant advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an abuse of the office," former Gov. Pete Wilson, Davis'
Republican predecessor, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Like many public officials, Wilson had a separate phone in the
office for making political phone calls. He noted that raising money
"obviously is a necessity" for candidates. But Wilson also said he
never requested contributions from people who visited him at the
Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "The setting of the governor's office is to at least a number of
people a special place," Wilson said. "It bespeaks the powers of the
office.... I think it is intimidating to some people."</TE>
<TE>   Current law allows statewide candidates to raise unlimited sums
from individual donors. Davis has received 56 donations of $100,000
or more since taking office in 1999. But though a handful of donors
spent $1 million or more to help him win election in 1998, no single
contributor has given him a seven-figure donation in his reelection
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "That the request was made at all is shocking," Jim Knox of
California Common Cause said. "But that it was made in the governor's
office makes it that much worse.... If you're talking about policy
with the governor in the governor's office, that would certainly
maximize the governor's leverage."</TE>
<TE>   Other critics of the campaign financing laws were less harsh. Bob
Stern, director of the nonpartisan Center for Governmental Studies in
Los Angeles, called it ironic that the California Teachers Assn.
raised the issue, given that it is among the largest campaign
spenders in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to require that he go across the street every time
he wants to fund-raise?" Stern said, though he added that he was
troubled that the pitch came during a discussion of policy issues.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers union was among Davis' biggest supporters in the 1998
election, spending $1.3 million to help the Democrat beat then-Atty.
Gen. Dan Lungren. Importantly, the union lent its well-organized
political operation to Davis, having teachers make phone calls to
voters urging that they support him.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, who calls public education his highest priority,
clashed with the teachers union almost from the start of his tenure.
In 1999, Davis pushed legislation requiring more use of standardized
student tests aimed at making schools more accountable, and giving
merit pay to teachers whose students excel on the tests.</TE>
<TE>   The union has endorsed Davis' reelection. It has given him $10,000
this year and $50,000 in 2000. Hard feelings eased in 2000 when
Davis, then presiding over multibillion-dollar budget surpluses,
earmarked $1.8 billion for teacher raises and became among the most
vocal foes of an initiative that would have allowed tax-funded
vouchers for private-school tuition. Still, Johnson said he doubts
the union will contribute much more unless Davis goes out of his way
to ease hard feelings with the union.</TE>
<TE>   "Our membership is angry with him," Johnson said. "We could not
make major financial commitments to him unless he does something to
really improve dramatically his popularity with teachers. Otherwise
we would have a revolt on our hands."</TE>

<HD>Enron Memos Fuel Inquiry of Power Pricing</HD>
<DH>Energy: Documents lend credence to claims the state's
crisis was at least partly manufactured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. memos released last week are providing new fuel for a
state investigation into whether traders illegally pumped up
electricity prices and manipulated California's power grid chief into
lifting price caps at a crucial juncture in the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The memos, which detail a variety of trading ploys to create
artificial shortages, also are lending credence to allegations that
the crisis was manufactured at least in part.</LD>
<LD>   The Enron documents lifted the veil on what was going on behind
the scenes as California sweated through a series of critical energy
shortages on the way to the first deliberate statewide blackouts
since World War II.</LD>
<TE>   One memo, dated Dec. 6, 2000, made the startling assertion that
one trading strategy "may have contributed" to California's
declaration a day earlier of a Stage 2 emergency, which is prompted
when electricity reserves fall below 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the memo was written, the head of the California
Independent System Operator unilaterally sought and won federal
permission to remove price caps designed to safeguard electricity
customers from runaway costs.</TE>
<TE>   His action, taken without consulting his board or the governor,
helped restore electricity supplies and stave off blackouts for more
than a month but caused prices to temporarily spike as the state's
largest utilities careened toward insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say the action by Terry Winter, chief executive of
Cal-ISO, to blow away California's hard-won and hotly debated price
caps had serious consequences. Within six weeks, already ailing
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison were out of
money, traders refused to sell them electricity and the state stepped
in as the primary power buyer for nearly 30 million Californians.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Cal-ISO suspected that Enron and other marketers were
working the system to their own advantage. But officials say they did
not know the extent of the manipulation, did not have adequate staff
or authority to police it and were scrambling to address a power
shortage that the marketers exacerbated.</TE>
<TE>   Now a state Senate panel headed by Joseph Dunn (D-Garden Grove) is
examining whether Winter was duped or coaxed into removing the price
limits by Enron and other power marketers who allegedly were "gaming"
the system for their own profit.</TE>
<TE>   "What communications did Winter have with the industry about those
caps?" asked Dunn, who launched his wider investigation months ago.
"Did he know the market was being manipulated?"</TE>
<TE>   Winter denied any improper contacts with market participants and
said his action got profit-minded marketers to resume selling in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "It allowed me to keep the lights on ... and it had the impact of
reducing prices when the market was competitive again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron released three memos Monday to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and to Dunn's committee, which is seeking more documents.</TE>
<TE>   Although Enron and other power sellers have repeatedly denied
manipulating California's electricity markets, Enron acknowledged in
the memos that its strategies resulted in supplies being withheld
from the state and prices being jacked ever higher. It also said
other energy companies had adopted similar tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Calling Winter's action a palace coup, critics allege that it
touched off a chain reaction that cost the state economy billions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Stage 2 alert that Enron says it may have helped cause "was
the cover that Terry Winter used to blow the price caps out in
California," state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta M.
Lynch said. "It was a situation that let FERC move to destroy our
market."</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials declined to comment, citing their ongoing
investigation into price manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Energy companies, economists and some politicians have said that
California's energy crisis resulted from a confluence of problems,
including insufficient power generation in the state, an increase in
demand and a rise in the price of natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   But in the memos, Enron acknowledged that its trading strategies
may have contributed to shortages.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's "Death Star" strategy, for example, involved creating fake
congestion on transmission lines so that the company could collect a
payment from Cal-ISO for relieving it. At the time, the agency cited
congestion as contributing to the state's power woes.</TE>
<TE>   Enron also said it bought power in California, where there was a
price cap of $250 per megawatt-hour, then resold it elsewhere at
several times that amount.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that in December of 2000 we were dealing
with a very artificial power crisis," said Robert McCullough, a
Portland, Ore., energy consultant, saying newly disclosed strategies
such as Death Star made the situation appear far worse than it may
have been.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who helped shape the state's
deregulation proposal in 1996, said there was a legitimate power
shortage, which allowed traders to take advantage of an already shaky
system.</TE>
<TE>   "If we weren't tight, they never would have hit us as hard as they
did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison President Robert G. Foster said the
documents show that market manipulation drove the price of
electricity higher. A spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO was created by the landmark 1996 deregulation law as a
sort of traffic cop that would balance electricity supply with demand
across a power grid serving about 75% of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit agency would buy power to make up the difference in
what the utilities had and what they needed. That difference,
ultimately paid for by the utilities, commonly was 6% to 8% during
the first two years, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But with electricity prices rising in mid-2000 and customer
utility rates frozen, PG&amp;E and Edison were reluctant to pay what the
sellers were demanding, so they left more and more of their load for
Cal-ISO to acquire--sometimes as much as 25%.</TE>
<TE>   In its memos, Enron noted that it counted on this pattern of
under-scheduling by utilities to make some of its trading tricks
work.</TE>
<TE>   Winter said Cal-ISO's marketing staff of four could not make phone
calls fast enough to line up the power, so they established a
computerized bidding system that listed marketers, bids and
quantities available.</TE>
<TE>   But in the winter of 2000, after the Cal-ISO board passed a price
cap of $250 per megawatt-hour, natural gas prices soared and
generators were saying it was costing them more to produce
electricity than they could get in California.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Cal-ISO's roster of power offerings shrank from 3,000 to
4,000 megawatts to a couple of hundred. To meet demand, Cal-ISO's
power hunters had to call outside their service territories to obtain
electricity--and that power was not subject to price caps.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cost of power was rising rapidly. On Dec. 5--the
day of the Stage 2 emergency that Enron said it may have helped
cause--Cal-ISO paid $5 million for energy. Within two days, the price
leaped to $86 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 7, Winter was in Arizona talking about blackout scenarios
with other Western grid operators, when California's first Stage 3
emergency was called as the state came perilously close to running
out of power. Moving to avoid the next stage--blackouts--Winter flew
home and authorized attorneys to prepare an emergency filing at FERC.</TE>
<TE>   Winter said speed was required.</TE>
<TE>   "I really did not want to debate something for four or five days
while the system went black," he said. "If the board did not like [my
action], on the next Monday they could have turned it around or fired
me."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis and others later publicly blasted Winter for
acting unilaterally. The Cal-ISO board discussed Winter's decision in
closed session, but took no action.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Smutny-Jones, then chairman of the Cal-ISO board, is the
executive director of the California Independent Energy Producers
Assn. He said Winter had the authority to go to FERC on his own when
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question these were extraordinary circumstances,"
Smutny-Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   The filing lifted the price cap, but it also provided that
companies selling at prices above the $250 cap had to justify the
price by disclosing their actual costs.</TE>
<TE>   After the cap was lifted, prices spiked, then declined but
remained far above historical levels. They went down after natural
gas prices fell, the state signed long-term contracts and federal
regulators established Western regional caps in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said FERC moved as quickly
as it did because the filing mirrored a proposed order already at
FERC. It also provided penalties for utilities that dump demand on
Cal-ISO and forced generators to sell available power.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, the PUC president, said it galled her that federal
regulators moved within a few hours on Winter's request to lift the
price caps but did not act promptly on a PUC filing raising
allegations against Enron for one of the tactics described in the
memo.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bring evidence of market manipulation, it takes a long
time," she said. "When you ask for elimination of a price cap, [FERC]
can move real quick."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn has been boring in on what Winter knew and when he knew it,
reviewing calendars and other internal documents. The senator has
deposed Cal-ISO officials, and is suspicious that there were improper
communications from market participants before Dec. 8, "laying the
groundwork for elimination of the price caps."</TE>
<TE>   Winter, a free market advocate and former San Diego Gas &amp; Electric
executive, acknowledged that marketers for years had pushed to have
price caps lifted, but he said that in early December 2000 "we never
talked about price caps or removal of caps."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said he did ask the marketers to increase the amount
of power they were offering in California and to get all available
generators running. "The answer was, 'We can't run it because we
can't operate at a loss.'"</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they were aware before the memos that they had
experienced the sorts of strategies described in the Enron memos.</TE>
<TE>   "We had identified these strategies as vulnerabilities or
weaknesses but did not know the extent they were being used," Winter
said, adding that Enron's competitors probably used similar tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Winter said some market manipulation issues were taken to the
board and others were addressed through software changes, notices to
generators or filings with federal regulators. Also, the agency has
levied $251 million in fines since it began operating in early 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, Winter said that Cal-ISO might have needed more
analysts to spot market manipulation. He said that, during the
crisis, his marketers were so busy they probably could not pass on
all suspicions about possible gaming.</TE>

<HD>Patently Provoking a Debate</HD>
<DH>Law: Two friends seek rights to a theoretical human-mouse,
thought up to force limits on patenting human life.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Nearly 10 years ago, a friend called Stuart Newman with an intriguing
challenge: Could he think up a new form of life that would be
scientifically useful and possible to patent--yet so disturbing that
the public would recoil?</LD>
<LD>   And so Newman, a New York medical school professor, proposed a
"humouse," a part-human, part-mouse creature that could be made with
existing lab techniques and would help companies test for the toxic
effects of new drugs. He even typed up a fake press release claiming
a trademark for the "humouse" name.</LD>
<LD>   Newman's proposal was far more than a whimsical exercise. Today,
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is in the final stages of
deciding whether he can patent his idea. Win or lose, the result
could be exactly what the humouse was designed to accomplish:
prodding Congress and the courts to place new limits on manipulating
and patenting human life.</LD>
<TE>   For the patent office, the humouse raises some awkward issues. For
22 years, the office has granted patents on a wide array of living
organisms and elements of life. Human genes have been patented. So
have human cells. Patents have gone to animals made with bits of
human DNA so scientists can study cancer and other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   But the patent office has drawn a line at claims on human embryos
and human beings themselves, saying that Congress, which writes the
patent laws, excluded them from the range of things that can be
patented. Although Congress has never spoken directly on the subject,
the patent office says it infers the ban on these patents from such
doctrines as the 13th Amendment ban of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   Some patent experts doubt that this stance is legally sound. Now
the humouse is forcing the patent office to defend its position. And
in five years of sparring over Newman's application, the office
appears to concede that it has little or no legal authority to stop
what would clearly be a controversial development: the patenting of
human embryos.</TE>
<TE>   The case will probably wind up in the courts, which could decide
whether patent rights to human life--and to new methods of making
human life--can be owned and controlled by private hands.</TE>
<TE>   Novel Plan for Raising Moral Objections</TE>
<TE>   Newman has never made a humouse and says he probably never would.
In fact, he and his patent partner, technology critic Jeremy Rifkin,
have deep moral objections to manipulating human life and oppose
patenting any living organisms. They believe that federal law does
not sufficiently limit scientific work with human embryos and human
life, and their humouse is intended to change just that.</TE>
<TE>   Patent law does not require them to make a humouse, but they must
show it can be done. Newman says he could take an embryo from one
species, either man or mouse, and inject it with embryonic cells from
the other species. The result would be an animal with cells from both
species scattered throughout and working cooperatively. A similar
technique was used in the early 1980s to make a sheep-goat hybrid,
dubbed a "geep," though no one is known to have tried a similar
cross-species mix with humans.</TE>
<TE>   "There really is no boundary on what you can do with human life.
There's no natural stopping point," Newman said. "That troubles me. I
think it will ultimately lead to genetically engineered human beings
made for sale."</TE>
<TE>   Making the humouse would be legal under federal law, as long as no
taxpayer money was used and certain administrative rules were
followed.</TE>
<TE>   By asking for a patent on the very thing they find unethical,
Newman and Rifkin believe they will provoke tighter limits on what
can be made and patented. If the patent office awards them a patent
on something widely considered monstrous, Congress could be pressured
to draw new laws on patenting life. And if the office rejects their
patent, Newman and Rifkin would gain standing to appeal in the
federal courts.</TE>
<TE>   They are happy to go to court. A judge's denial of a humouse
patent would probably bar patents on all human-animal hybrids and
possibly on human embryos. And even if they win a patent in court,
they expect a public outcry that also could force Congress to act.</TE>
<TE>   So far, patent examiners have denied the humouse patent on grounds
that it "embraces a human being" and human beings cannot be patented.
But how, Newman and Rifkin ask, does the patent office know that a
human-animal combination is human?</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first test of what constitutes a human being in the
age of biotechnology," Rifkin said. "When we can engineer life,
answering these questions becomes an angst-laden struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Experts See Important Implications</TE>
<TE>   Patent experts say the humouse case could be important for three
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, no court has ruled on whether human embryos can be
patented, or whether a mix of human and animal material remains, in a
legal sense, human. This lack of legal clarity is becoming more
important as scientists push to understand embryos and the medically
promising stem cells that grow inside them.</TE>
<TE>   A Massachusetts company, Advanced Cell Technology Inc., is trying
to produce and patent human stem cells made by merging human DNA with
cow eggs, creating a human-cow embryo. A Chinese scientist is working
with human-rabbit combinations. Cow and rabbit eggs are far cheaper
than human eggs, and producing stem cells with them could prove more
inexpensive and efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the patent office has allowed thousands of claims on
genes, cells and animals over the last two decades. By raising the
question of what can be patented, Newman and Rifkin hope to undermine
some of those patents.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the patent dispute is part of a political struggle to
define the legal and moral status of the human embryo. President Bush
has barred federal funding for experiments that destroy embryos for
their stem cells, and he has devoted two speeches to arguing that
embryo destruction is unethical in research. Within weeks, the Senate
is expected to vote on whether it should be legal to create human
embryos through cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Still, cloning and stem cell research are legal today. Congress
has not said embryos are so privileged that they deserve protection
from privately funded researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the patent office argues that human embryos are equivalent to
human beings, which puts them beyond the reach of patent claims. "No
question, they're in a very strange status," said George Annas, a
bioethicist at Boston University. "They're not the same as mouse
embryos, but we haven't really decided how different they are."</TE>
<TE>   "There is tremendous symbolism here," said R. Alta Charo,
professor of law and medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin
Law School. "Patents stand for the idea that somebody invented
something. For those who are religious, it smacks of hubris to say
that human beings were invented. They were invented by God."</TE>
<TE>   1980 Case Allows Patents for Organisms</TE>
<TE>   At one time, the patent office believed living organisms could not
be patented. That put the office in accord with people such as
Newman, a developmental biologist at New York Medical College in
Valhalla, N.Y. He believes that patents on life are an "incursion of
private property and private ownership into the realm of nature, into
what should be common property."</TE>
<TE>   But the patent office was forced to change its policy in 1980
after it turned down a patent application from General Electric for a
bacterium that had been genetically engineered to "eat" oil spills.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric appealed to the Supreme Court, in a case called
Diamond vs. Chakrabarty. Only one "friend of the court" brief was
filed arguing that life should not be patented. It was written by
Jeremy Rifkin and his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court, however, said in a 5-4 ruling that Congress had
authorized patents on "anything under the sun that is made by man."
And because the GE microorganism was man-made and not naturally
occurring, the court ruled that it qualified for a patent.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first Supreme Court ruling to endorse patents on living
organisms. Eventually, the patent office began issuing patents on a
barnyard of more complex animals --genetically engineered mice, pigs
and cows. Rifkin thought this went far beyond the authority laid out
by the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to revisit the question of what is legally patentable
and what is not," said Rifkin, president of the Foundation on
Economic Trends in Washington. "But you can't bring litigation
against the patent office. They have utter discretion, and you can't
challenge them from the outside. The only way to be a player is to
apply for a patent."</TE>
<TE>   And so Rifkin called Newman to ask what invention might make their
case best--and bring as much publicity as possible along the way.</TE>
<TE>   After considering the humouse, Newman and Rifkin later broadened
their idea to include human combinations with chimpanzees, baboons
and other animals. They filed a patent application in 1997, with
Newman as inventor and Rifkin as a co-owner.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, two years after receiving the humouse application, the
patent office issued a preliminary rejection. Patent examiner Deborah
Crouch said the human-animal hybrid "embraces a human being"--and so
did not qualify for a patent.</TE>
<TE>   When Newman and Rifkin pressed the office to identify a law that
bars human embryo patents, a second examiner, Deborah Clark, wrote
that patents on embryos and human beings would clash with the 13th
Amendment's ban on slavery.</TE>
<TE>   A patent is good for 20 years and allows the holder to prevent
anyone else from using an invention. Because of this, Clark wrote,
"the patented human being could conceivably be excluded by the
patentee from 'using' himself, i.e. self-employment, an absurdity
that reinforces the conclusion that Congress did not intend to allow
patenting of human beings."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a patent conveys the right to bar anyone else from
making the patented invention. If that invention were a human being
or viable embryo, Clark argued, the patent holder could stop that
person from copying himself--in other words, from reproducing.</TE>
<TE>   Some patent lawyers question these arguments. Roe vs. Wade, after
all, holds that embryos at their earliest stages are not
constitutionally protected as human beings, suggesting that the
patent office should not equate embryos with people. And the 13th
Amendment argument is "just nonsense," Charo said, because a person,
once born, has all the rights of citizenship, including the right to
a work life free of patent restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   What in the Mix Makes It a Human?</TE>
<TE>   But even if the patent office had the power to bar patents on
human embryos, Newman and Rifkin said in written responses, how did
the office classify a human-animal hybrid as human?</TE>
<TE>   Clark pointed to the hypothetical case of a person who received a
pig heart. This would mix two species, but the result was clearly
human, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rifkin and Newman argue that their creatures, composed of
cells from two species scattered throughout, are wholly different
from a human.</TE>
<TE>   In the patent office's most recent rejection notice, in August
2000, Clark included a passage that Rifkin, Newman and others took as
a clear indication that the office has no authority to reject claims
on human embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has not spoken directly to embryo patents, and neither
has the Supreme Court, the patent examiner wrote. "In the absence of
clear legislative intent and guidance from the courts," she added,
"it is incumbent on the office to proceed cautiously."</TE>
<TE>   "She's conceding that they don't have explicit authority to reject
this application as 'embracing a human being,'" said Patrick Coyne,
the lawyer for Newman and Rifkin. But the office is rejecting the
application anyway "so the issue can be decided in court," he said.
"To just give it to us would open the floodgates to these kinds of
patents." The patent office would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Patent examiners told Newman and Rifkin to expect a final
rejection of their application more than a year ago, but instead the
office sent it to a ''quality review'' process, which usually take
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Rejection Could Preclude New Products</TE>
<TE>   For the biotechnology industry, the humouse case is serious
business. Without strong patent protections, the industry says,
investors will not risk money to develop new products. And Rifkin and
Newman aim to narrow the scope of what elements of life can be
patented.</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin and Newman claim that denying their patent throws many
existing patents into question. They ask how the patent office can
reject a mouse-animal hybrid because of its human qualities while not
also rejecting all-human stem cells, which come from embryos and can
grow into any part of the body.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most sensitive questions is whether patents can cover
human embryos that have been engineered to carry certain traits.
Although the Biotechnology Industry Assn. says it does not support
the patenting of human embryos, pressure may grow from individual
biotech companies.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had a system where the embryo could be used to generate
cells for therapeutic use, then there could be a compelling reason to
want a patent," said Elizabeth Howard, a patent lawyer in Palo Alto
with the firm Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Howard said, scientists will try to modify human
embryos to produce stem cells that can be transplanted into patients
without resulting in tissue rejection, a common problem in
transplants today.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say they also want to create human embryos to study
disease. Many people carry genes that raise their risk of breast
cancer, colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other ailments. Through
cloning, scientists could take a cell from one of these people and
use it to create an embryo that also would have the disease genes.
Stem cells from that embryo could offer clues to mechanisms of the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists consider this work so promising that they have
cited it in asking Congress not to outlaw human cloning in medical
research.</TE>
<TE>   But some people fear that researchers will not only want to make
embryos and stem cells this way but also patent them. With so many
disease genes to study, companies could eventually ask for separate
patents on each type of embryo they created. Companies already patent
and sell mice, rats and other animals that have been engineered to
model various human diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of human cloning, in fact, have run radio advertisements
that play up the prospect of embryo patents, in an attempt to
persuade the Senate to outlaw the technique.</TE>
<TE>   "It hearkens back to slavery," said Douglas Johnson, legislative
director of the National Right to Life Council, which sponsored the
ads. "You would have biotechnology companies owning a class of
members of the species Homo sapiens and selling them because of
particular genetic traits that are deemed useful in drug testing or
experimentation."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Congress may have to decide what life forms are proper
material for patenting. The Supreme Court invited such an action in
its Chakrabarty ruling 22 years ago, noting that lawmakers "may
choose to craft a statute specifically designed for such living
things."</TE>
<TE>   "Both the majority and minority probably thought Congress would
have to say something after that decision, but Congress hasn't said a
thing," said Annas, the Boston University bioethicist. "It's
Congress' job to say what the limits are of patent law, and it's time
for Congress to do that."</TE>
<TE>   But resolving the question would require a compromise between
lawmakers who consider embryos equivalent to humans and those who
hope to use them to make stem cells and tissues for patients.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a society are ambivalent about the moral status of the
embryo," said Arthur L. Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of
Pennsylvania. "That's why this has been going on for a long time, and
why no one wants to try to sort it out."</TE>

<HD>A Network's Mastery Has Gone to Pieces</HD>
<DH>Television: With PBS' ratings at all-time lows, a former
CNN producer is battling to revitalize its programming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>It picked up a new series for teenagers, put up ads in the New York
subway and even gave away promotional T-shirts at Florida spring
break sites.</LD>
<LD>   And how have viewers rewarded the Public Broadcasting Service for
these efforts?</LD>
<LD>   Well, in February, for example, they tuned in en masse--to watch
"Antiques Roadshow" and a special chronicling Queen Elizabeth's 50
years on the British throne.</LD>
<TE>   The broadcasting service that a generation ago brought America
such high-toned melodramas as "I, Claudius" and "Upstairs,
Downstairs" is living through a tense drama of its own lately.</TE>
<TE>   Its prime-time ratings have hit historic lows, the median age of
its viewers is a demographically unappealing 55, and it is fighting
for its place--some would say its life--in a television landscape
full of better-funded cable copycats such as A&amp;E and Discovery. Even
Britain's BBC, while it still has close PBS ties, has launched its
own U.S. channel. And a looming $1.8-billion conversion to digital
transmission threatens to add complexity and confusion to the
situation by turning each PBS outlet into as many as four channels.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the fray is Pat Mitchell, the respected and
well-connected producer hired from CNN Productions two years ago to
tackle the problems.</TE>
<TE>   She and her team have launched a host of initiatives. They bought
a failed but acclaimed Fox series for teenagers, "American High," and
rescued "American Family," one of the first dramas to feature a
Latino family, when CBS dropped it. A new Friday night public affairs
series, "Now With Bill Moyers," is helping PBS respond quickly to the
news and has forged a partnership with noncommercial National Public
Radio. Signature series switched nights they had occupied for a
decade or more, as PBS tried to be savvy about counterprogramming its
competition.</TE>
<TE>   With deep roots in Hollywood (she counts Robert Redford, Jane
Fonda and Glenn Close as friends), Mitchell spent her first year
actively embracing the PBS system, traveling nonstop to stations. She
convened summits at Redford's Sundance Institute, where stations and
producers hammered out common goals and she pushed them to ban the
word "dysfunctional," a frequent adjective applied to public TV. At
the June 2001 annual meeting in Philadelphia, she dramatically asked
station executives to sign a "Declaration of Interdependence" set up
on oversized boards.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her quick and aggressive start in the job, prime-time
ratings for 2001's fourth quarter were the lowest in PBS history,
attracting just 1.7% of the nation's TV homes on average, and haven't
moved much since. The new shows haven't drawn the large new audiences
executives hoped, despite some of PBS' biggest promotional campaigns
ever, including the New York subway ads and the T-shirt giveaways.
Worse, viewers tuned out schedule stalwarts such as "American
Experience." What viewers still seem to prefer is the old-style
programming, preferably with a British accent.</TE>
<TE>   Culture Clashes Occur Inside the Network</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell herself has questioned whether their decline signals that
PBS' future is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only are we not top of mind, we are dangerously close in our
overall prime-time number to falling below the relevance quotient,"
she told public TV programmers in a closed February meeting. "And if
that happens, we will surely fall below any arguable need for
government support, not to mention corporate or individual support.
There is a level beyond which we cannot go and still claim to be a
universal service."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell has found many of her initiatives stymied by a deep
internal culture clash, pitting those who would push PBS to adopt
more real-world survival strategies against those who fear that core
viewers are being driven away and that the system's uniqueness and
even noncommercial mission are under siege.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I had no idea how hard it was going to be," Mitchell
said in an interview from her office in Alexandria. "A lot of
constituencies have a lot of investment in keeping things the way
they are, and that builds in a resistance to change."</TE>
<TE>   PBS still has a role in the TV universe, particularly for the 20%
of viewers who don't have cable or satellite services, said Robert
Thompson, a professor of media and pop culture at Syracuse
University. But cable viewers have many other choices, he said,
leaving Mitchell with the difficult task of remolding PBS while at
the same time not alienating core viewers. And the brand itself is
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "On one level PBS carries with it incredibly powerful images of
'MacNeil/Lehrer,' Big Bird, 'Sesame Street' and Bill Moyers.... There
are some real icons. It can also mean pretentious, slow, stodgy,
self-consciously educational," Thompson said. Mitchell and her team,
he added, "need to cash in on the brand value PBS has, and at the
same time they have to try to break out of it. The two goals are
contradictory."</TE>
<TE>   Financial Show Missteps Provide Object Lesson</TE>
<TE>   A revamping of "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser," in the
works for a year, should have been a relatively easy step, but it
turned into a public relations fiasco and an object lesson in the
inherent difficulties in the PBS system.</TE>
<TE>   The program had languished largely unchanged for its 32 years,
even as it slipped to being PBS' lowest-rated prime-time series.
Mitchell says it was one of the first programs she was asked by
member stations to tackle.</TE>
<TE>   PBS and Maryland Public Television, which produces the show, tried
to work with Rukeyser, 69. He resisted, describing the efforts in one
internal e-mail as a "wrongheaded crusade to depreciate us." His
lawyer, Richard Hofstetter, said producers were never specific about
what changes they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The producers brought in Fortune magazine as a partner anyway.
Rukeyser claimed he had been sandbagged, dramatically appealed on air
to viewers and was promptly fired--wrongly, Hofstetter said. His
ouster provoked an outpouring of complaints. Donors and local
corporate underwriters pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   "On any rational level it was probably about time to update that
show," said Thompson. But viewers rebelled, he said, because, "in the
average American home, PBS has got this reputation of old-fashioned,
stodgy stability." Just as with the recent outcry over ABC's possible
cancellation of "Nightline," he said, many viewers "want the comfort
that they're there, but they don't want to actually watch them."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said she was "extremely disappointed in the lies and
misrepresentations [Rukeyser] put forth." But her disappointment
extends to some of her own PBS stations, 119 of whom defied her
appeals and are airing a new Rukeyser program--taking shows he is now
doing for commercial cable's CNBC and rebroadcasting them. "He
defamed and devalued public television," said Mitchell. "I was
shocked and disappointed that public television stations chose to put
him on the air given that he chose to do that."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not out to get public television," Hofstetter said. "If
[Rukeyser] had his druthers, he'd still be doing the show.... It was
they who decided to remove him."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the whole situation was really unfortunate for public
television," said Terrel Cass, president and general manager of New
York station WLIW, which is distributing Rukeyser's CNBC show. But
stations "were interested in keeping the audiences that Rukeyser had
built up over all those years and keeping the local underwriting. Our
goal and purpose was certainly not to poke at Pat or PBS." And with
the multichannel digital era looming, he said, "there ought to be
room for more than just the one stream" of programming.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the battle of wills is local control. Unlike a
commercial network that contractually has the right to impose a
schedule on affiliates, each of PBS' 349 local stations is
autonomous. With deep ties to their communities, many stations are
unwilling to turn over decision-making to "Braddock Place," as they
refer to the PBS programmers' home base outside Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "You're dealing with a fundamental tension in a system that is
rooted in a local ethic and model unlike anything we have in American
broadcasting," said Willard "Wick" Rowland, president and general
manager of Colorado Public Broadcasting. Over three decades, he says,
"there has been a struggle to create some semblance of a network
organization without many of the trappings of network structure,
which include total control over the local schedule at a centralized
base."</TE>
<TE>   'We Are Essentially a Poor Network'</TE>
<TE>   Producer Ken Burns, whose documentary "The Civil War" was public
television's highest-rated miniseries, calls PBS a "confederacy" that
inevitably causes tension between the stations and PBS. Lack of money
adds more tension, forcing PBS to shortchange marketing simply to get
programs made. "We are essentially a poor network," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've become rather risk-averse and very slow to change," said
Rex Adams, a Duke University professor and chairman of PBS' board.
"We're dependent on a small and fervently loyal membership base that
ages along with us and declines as God sees fit." Change unsettles
that base, he said, and "when you live hand to mouth as every station
in the system does, things tend to get spirited and contentious real
quick."</TE>
<TE>   A financial breakdown from fiscal 1999, the latest available,
shows that Congress, state and local governments provided 34.5% of
public television revenue of $1.6 billion, colleges and universities
an additional 7.9%; the rest came from corporate underwriting,
viewers and foundations.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, 59, is the first programmer to run PBS.</TE>
<TE>   She came to PBS after a successful career producing acclaimed
television documentaries for Ted Turner, forming along the way strong
ties to a network of connected activist women and political figures
such as former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</TE>
<TE>   Her push for change has taken on personal overtones, as Mitchell's
opponents in the system are becoming increasingly vocal, even as she
retains the support of PBS' board of managers and many influential
station managers.</TE>
<TE>   "Pat is changing the culture very effectively," said Al Jerome,
president and general manager of Los Angeles PBS station KCET. "It
was necessary and it will be very positive." Nonetheless, he says,
"there's a difference between the expectation of change and the
actual pain."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Mitchell concedes missteps. "American High" got
Coca-Cola to underwrite a PBS show for the first time but alienated
older viewers with its rough language and frank themes. PBS dropped a
subsequent show for younger viewers. "We built an audience and then
let them down," Mitchell said. "If I had known that would happen, I
would not do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Her vision now is to balance new material with some tried and
true, to lower PBS' median audience age to 50 or less, putting it
closer to the broadcast networks than cable outlets such as A&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell insists that ratings won't define PBS, whose mission is
to provide programming that commercial networks don't.</TE>
<TE>   But the ratings clearly are cause for concern. They took a steep
dive after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; PBS says some of the
falloff was probably because of temporary changes in audiences'
tastes, as PBS' older viewers flocked to cable news. Some of it was
bad luck: PBS had been planning for more than a year to move many
signature programs from long-held time slots, which happened in
October, just when viewers were distracted. Ratings bounced back in
January, then dropped to an even lower 1.6 in February, March and
April (the high-rated "Frontier House," which premiered April 29,
will count in the May Nielsen ratings).</TE>
<TE>   Localism Is Still an Important Tenet</TE>
<TE>   The numbers panicked many at the stations.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of money, time, attention and promotion was gambled on a
very few new properties," said one influential and disgruntled
station executive who declined to be named. "New initiatives haven't
taken us in the right direction and experimentation is noble, but
decisions do have consequences. There is no margin for error."</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been better if the choices made by [Mitchell and
her team] had been more successful," but "there's not an obvious
answer" to fixing prime time, said Robert Coonrod, president of the
Corp. for Public Broadcasting, which distributes the federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell isn't arguing against localism, which, she says, will end
up being an PBS asset. "As we move through these consolidations and
mergers that are changing the media landscape so completely ...
public television will be the last locally owned, managed and
licensed media in town," she said. But first, she said, PBS and
stations must "just agree on a few things, where local autonomy could
be subsumed for the good of all on some big key issues."</TE>
<TE>   She means the national schedule, arguing that PBS has to move
quickly because of intense competition. She also wants stations to
commit to running shows at the same time on the same night. Changes
hurt PBS' ability to promote shows nationally, leaving them to use
the vague phrase "check local listings."</TE>
<TE>   PBS is restricted in another way: It doesn't produce shows
directly but must find a member station to "present" a program. Three
stations dominate: Boston's WGBH, New York's WNET and Washington's
WETA, and some at those stations haven't been happy at Mitchell's
attempts to bring in more producers, including commercial ones such
as Redford, who is part of the team developing American stories for
"Mystery!" Nor was everyone pleased about PBS' plan to conduct focus
groups through Los Angeles-based ASI Entertainment on nine of its
major shows to see what viewers like and don't like.</TE>
<TE>   Some programmers have countered that Mitchell's team has ignored
the ongoing series for which PBS is known. So PBS is turning to
audience favorites for new shows, including "Frontline/World," a
spinoff of the documentary series. In the fall it will rerun Burns'
landmark "The Civil War," followed by a weekly program taken from his
archive of work, much of it rarely rerun. The move, Burns said, "can
be seen as conservative, safe, falling back on our strengths. I see
it as: Here's an opportunity just to see this material."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said she remains committed to taking risks on new shows,
and there are some encouraging signs. Many stations reported healthy
increases in donations during December and March pledge drives. KCET
highlighted an "American Family" episode in March and drew $20,000 in
donations, equal to the response during a Victor Borge retrospective.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't cling to the 75-year-old viewer with no hope for the
future," Mitchell said. "Holding onto the past is a formula for
failure."</TE>

<HD>No Surprise That Duncan, O'Neal Keys to Success</HD>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>There are times when these Western Conference semifinals come to a
standstill, when the rest of the Lakers and San Antonio Spurs fade
into the background and it's only Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   They don't always guard each other, but when they do it's as if
time stops. The game is back to its most basic element, one on one.
The newly anointed most valuable player against the league's most
desirable player. A classic matchup of big men. Like baseball
doubleheaders, you just don't see much of those anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Even on the off days, everything focuses on Duncan and O'Neal. Can
Duncan handle the multitude of responsibilities tossed on him? How
much will O'Neal's assortment of injuries allow him to impact this
series?</LD>
<TE>   Although O'Neal is hobbling, he can lean on the ultimate crutch in
Kobe Bryant. Duncan doesn't have that, and so far this series he
appears to be missing that one extra gear the superstars find in
crunch time.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs have been outplayed in the fourth quarter of all three
games, and it has cost them two defeats. That has to come as a
reflection of Duncan, because he's their guy.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan had only two turnovers in Game 3 Friday night, but they
both came in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Duncan isn't mentally tough; remember he's doing all
of this fewer than two weeks after his father's death.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Spurs are forced to ask too much of Duncan: Score
against his man, create shot opportunities for his teammates and shut
down the middle on defense.</TE>
<TE>   He's averaging 27 points, 16.7 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 3.3
blocks. But he's shooting only 37%. He has taken one fourth of the
team's shots.</TE>
<TE>   "My looks are always contested, but I've gotten into the middle
and had some looks," Duncan said. "It's about knocking them out.
We've got to finish shots. I'm probably more guilty than anybody of
doing that."</TE>
<TE>   As far as his quarterbacking responsibilities, "It puts a lot of
pressure, but honestly, it's kind of on me to get people shots. We
have to move the ball, I have to be unselfish enough to move the ball
out and execute our pick-and-rolls."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers don't like to double-team, but they often have to when
Robert Horry or Samaki Walker guard Duncan. Duncan has plenty of
practice going against two or three men over the course of the
season, but the Lakers do it a little differently.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not really double-teaming until the last second, but
they're there all the time," Duncan said. "I've got to do a better
job of finding the shooters, moving the ball, executing our offense."</TE>
<TE>   The execution doesn't come very easily for a team that has three
players in its starting lineup who weren't with them last season:
Bruce Bowen, Tony Parker and Steve Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that Tim has to deal with," Spur Coach Gregg
Popovich said. "It's a decision-making process down there. The
coordination between inside and outside, we're trying to get better
at it all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Timmy's going through the process of, 'Am I going to do this
myself or am I going to trust my teammates?' There's always a little
bit of both involved. Shaq's had a lot of time with those guys to
figure it out."</TE>
<TE>   Popovich has repeatedly praised O'Neal's floor sense. O'Neal is
doing a better job than ever of reading defenses and finding his
teammates. It helps that he often has four players on the court with
him who have been with the Lakers since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   That's about the only edge O'Neal has right now. His touch is off
because of the stitches in his right index finger that he cut in Game
1. His lateral movement and jumping are hampered because of the
arthritic big toe on his right foot and his sprained ankles.</TE>
<TE>   So he's just kind of there, occupying space.</TE>
<TE>   He actually has more trouble against some smaller, quicker players
than he does against Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great player," O'Neal said. "But I'm a big body, he really
can't bang me around. He really is going to have to shoot the jumper
over me. When the jumper's falling, he'll probably have a good night.
But I just try to stay in his way. No guy in this league can really
be stopped one on one. I just try to contain him."</TE>
<TE>   Even in his limited state, O'Neal produced 22 points and 15
rebounds in Game 3. Not enough to satisfy him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's against my religion, to get 22 and 15," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most teams would love to get that from their center.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't play for most teams," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Which is their problem, really. Even now, he still gives the
Lakers at worst an even shot against Duncan, canceling out the Spurs'
best player.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure he wishes he was a little bit healthier," Popovich said.
"But he's still a monster."</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays End 15-Game Frustration With a Winn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the ball left his bat, Randy Winn couldn't be sure that
baseball's longest losing streak in 14 years was over.</LD>
<LD>   "I was praying, hoping it would go out," Winn said Saturday night
after his two-out, three-run homer in the ninth inning defeated
Baltimore, 6-4, at St. Petersburg, Fla., and ended the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays' 15-game skid in startling fashion.</LD>
<LD>   "I honestly haven't hit enough home runs to know whether they're
going out or not. I've never hit a game-winning home run. It's
different."</LD>
<TE>   The Devil Rays were one out from becoming the third team to lose
16 in a row in the last 25 years. Their skid was the longest in the
majors since 1988, when the Orioles opened the season with an
AL-record 21-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to get some relief. But for me, it's on to tomorrow,"
Tampa Bay Manager Hal McRae said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to try to put something together and show people what
we're made of. Everybody knew what we were about when we were losing
because we were all over TV and all over the newspapers. This is our
moment to show people what we're really made of."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay had not scored a run in the ninth inning this season
before rallying to score four times with two out against closer Jorge
Julio (2-1).</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays trailed, 4-2, before Jason Tyner and Chris Gomez
started the rally with singles. With two out, Brent Abernathy singled
to drive in his second run of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Winn followed with his third homer this season, hitting a 2-and-2
pitch over the center-field fence. The crowd of 10,811 at Tropicana
Field kept cheering, and Winn took a curtain call.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 3, Boston 1--John Halama pitched 61/3 shutout innings and
the Mariners beat the Red Sox for the second consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Boston arrived at Seattle riding a nine-game winning streak, but
the Red Sox have been outscored, 10-3, by the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki had three hits to raise his batting average to .360,
and the Mariners took advantage of 11 walks. Darren Oliver (4-2) and
knuckleballer Tim Wakefield each walked five batters.</TE>
<TE>   Halama (2-0), making his third start this season, limited the Red
Sox to five hits and a walk, with four strikeouts. He was replaced by
Shigetoshi Hasegawa after Jose Offerman doubled in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox scored against Hasegawa on a double by Rey Sanchez and
a single by Johnny Damon in the eighth before Arthur Rhodes replaced
Hasegawa.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Minnesota 2--Robin Ventura hit a two-run homer in the
ninth inning, leading the Yankees at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Williams had a single, double and triple to help the
Yankees win their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 43,465 was the Twins' largest for a non-opening day
since 44,665 showed up for a game July 22 against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   With closer Eddie Guardado (0-1) on the mound in the ninth,
Williams doubled with one out before Ventura's towering shot to
right, his eighth this season.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano Rivera earned his 12th save in 14 tries.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 7, Toronto 4--Eric Chavez hit a grand slam, Barry Zito won
his 11th consecutive decision at home, and the Athletics ended a
four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Mondesi hit an inside-the-park home run for the Blue Jays,
who lost their 12th in 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   Zito (3-2) struck out 10 in six innings. He gave up two runs and
five hits. The left-hander hasn't lost a regular-season game at the
Oakland Coliseum since June 2 against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Miller (2-1) lost in the majors for the first time, giving
up six runs in four innings. He was traded with Eric Hinske from
Toronto to the Athletics for closer Billy Koch in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 10, Detroit 6--Alex Rodriguez homered twice at Arlington,
Texas, including a two-run drive in a seven-run second inning, and
the Rangers handed the Tigers their fourth consecutive defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez hit a solo homer in the fourth inning that stretched
Texas' lead to 8-4 and gave him an AL-leading 12 homers. Rodriguez
has three multihomer games this season and 23 in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Burba (3-0) trailed, 4-0, in the second inning before the
Rangers came to his rescue. Burba gave up four runs and seven hits in
six innings, striking out four and walking two.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland at Kansas City--The game was rained out and no makeup
date was announced. After today's game, the Indians don't play at
Kansas City until July.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Team Has Plenty in Reserve With Ramirez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julio Ramirez arrived in the Angel clubhouse Saturday afternoon and
found a gift on the chair in front of his locker.</LD>
<LD>   It was the Angels' dugout lineup card from the previous night's
game, a 19-0 rout of the White Sox in which Ramirez delivered a
pinch-hit home run during the sixth inning.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first homer of Ramirez's career and it came against the
team that released him in spring training because of a logjam of
outfielders.</LD>
<TE>   "I wasn't thinking about a home run," said Ramirez, an outfielder
who was promoted from triple-A Salt Lake on May 2. "I'm still not
thinking about hitting [home runs]. If they come, they come. But that
was nice."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, 24, has made the most of his opportunities with the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   In his Angel debut on May 2 at Cleveland, he bunted for a base hit
and threw out a runner at the plate from right field.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he hit a two-run triple in a 7-6 victory over the
Detroit Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he pinch-hit for Darin Erstad in the sixth inning with
a runner on and hit the first pitch he saw from reliever Mike Porzio
into the seats beyond the left-field fence. Ramirez became the first
Angel player since Damion Easley in 1993 to hit his first career
homer as a pinch-hitter. He also had a run-scoring single in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what that role really calls for--someone who can maybe sit
for awhile, come on and have a good bat," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "He certainly showed that last night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Designated hitter Brad Fullmer, acquired in an off-season trade
with the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Brian Cooper, was relieved to
hit his first homer for the Angels in Friday night's game.</TE>
<TE>   It was Fullmer's first homer in 144 at-bats dating to last season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to not have a zero up there, but at the same time,
being too conscious of homers kind of got me into the struggles I've
been having," Fullmer said. "I've just been trying to get back to
being more compact and hitting the ball solid."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer had two other hits Friday, including a run-scoring single,
to raise his average to .269. He extended his hitting streak to a
club-high nine games Saturday with a lead-off double in the sixth
inning against Jon Garland in the Angels' 6-3 victory over the White
Sox.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a lot of work to do to get really locked in,"
Fullmer said. "But I'm getting there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox's 19-0 defeat on Friday was the worst loss in the
franchise's 102-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox had previously lost by 17 runs three times, the most
recent occurring on Sept. 5, 1976 in an 18-1 loss to the Minnesota
Twins.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after handing the Chicago White Sox their worst loss in the
franchise's 102-year history, the Angels cut down on quantity but
maintained quality.</LD>
<LD>   Ramon Ortiz pitched seven strong innings in his fourth consecutive
quality start as the Angels defeated the White Sox, 6-3, on Saturday
night before 40,535 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz (4-3) gave up three runs and seven hits in seven innings and
struck out eight in his third consecutive victory. It was a marked
contrast to the last time Ortiz faced the White Sox.</LD>
<TE>   On Sept. 3, 2000, he gave up nine runs and eight hits in
two-thirds of an inning, the shortest stint of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, everything is working," Ortiz said. "My mechanics, my
fastball, my changeup, my slider, all my pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine pitched a scoreless eighth and Troy Percival struck out
the side for the second time in his last three appearances to record
his sixth save.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who collected a major league season-high 24 hits in
their 19-0 victory over the White Sox on Friday, had 12 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus hit a two-run homer and Scott Speizio had a two-run
double during a five-run first inning, Garret Anderson had two
doubles and Brad Fullmer extended his hitting streak to a team-best
nine games with a double in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The victory assured the Angels (19-16) of their fifth consecutive
series victory, a feat they had not accomplished since winning nine
series in a row in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   They have won 13 of their last 15 games. After going 1-8 in their
first nine home games, they are now 9-2 in their last 11 at Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   "The real story these last two nights is our starting pitching,"
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "That is a very, very talented
offensive club over there. That just underscores how our pitchers,
and our starting pitchers in particular, are doing a heck of a job."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz entered the game with opponents batting .219 against him. He
had given up only three earned runs in his last 30 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the 13 runs Ortiz had given up this season were scored on
eight home runs, including the back-to-back solo shots he surrendered
in his last start to Jose Cruz Jr. and Carlos Delgado of the Toronto
Blue Jays with two out in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz's homer spoiled Ortiz's bid for his first shutout, and a home
run also foiled his bid Saturday when Paul Konerko followed a double
by Magglio Ordonez with a home run in the sixth inning that made the
score 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz gave up one more run on a run-scoring double by Jose
Valentin in the seventh before finishing his 103-pitch performance by
striking out Aaron Rowand to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, White Sox starter Jon Garland (4-2) was foiled in his
attempt to win his fifth game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Garland, 22, is the youngest member of a White Sox rotation that
counts 30-year-old Todd Ritchie as its elder statesman.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-6, 205-pound right-hander, who was the Chicago Cubs'
No. 1 draft pick in 1997 out of Granada Hills Kennedy High, came into
the game with a four-game winning streak. The streak, however, was
deceptive because Garland also carried a 5.54 earned-run average and
was receiving 10.37 runs of support per game, the highest average in
the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Angels who continued their recent offensive
onslaught, wasting no time picking up where they left off Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   After Ortiz struck out three of the four batters he faced in the
first inning, Darin Erstad laced a one-out single to left field and
Glaus followed with a home run to left on a 3-and-2 pitch. It was
Glaus' seventh homer.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson doubled to right and, after Fullmer hit a fly ball to
center field and Tim Salmon walked, Speizio hit a double down the
first-base line to give the Angels a 4-0 lead. Jorge Fabregas
followed with a run-scoring single to left field to give Ortiz a
five-run cushion.</TE>
<TE>   After the White Sox pulled to within 5-2 on Konerko's fifth homer
in the sixth, the Angels answered.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer led off the sixth with his double into the gap in right
field. Garland walked Salmon and was replaced by left-hander Damaso
Marte, who surrendered a run-scoring single to left by Speizio that
made it 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox narrowed the margin to three runs in the seventh
when Kenny Lofton hit a two-out triple and Valentin drove him in with
a double.</TE>
<TE>   But after conferring with pitching coach Bud Black on the mound,
Ortiz struck out Rowand to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   After Levine worked the eighth, Percival struck out Jeff Liefer,
Mark Johnson and Royce Clayton to end the game.</TE>

<HD>Floyd Plays It Cool in Florida</HD>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>In the heat and humidity of south Florida, "chill factor" has a
double meaning for Cliff Floyd. In the lingo of the Florida Marlins'
hulking clean-up batter, their leading run producer as they come of
age at the top of the National League East, reaching a state of
"chill" at the plate is reaching that perfect state of concentration
and contact.</LD>
<LD>   It may be a simplistic way to put it, but now that Floyd continues
to shed the injury-prone label he acquired with the Montreal Expos,
now that he continues to pile up plate appearances and fulfill a
potential that appeared scarred by the sutures, Floyd has been
producing an abundance of chills and thrills.</LD>
<LD>   At 29, the All-Star of last year is looking like a most valuable
player candidate, and in the opinion of John Boles, the former
Florida manager who is now a senior advisor with the Dodgers, is
really "just beginning to scratch the surface of his talent. The
sky's the limit."</LD>
<TE>   Floyd doesn't disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee that if I play every day and continue to keep the
confidence level I have right now, I'll do some things that deserve
attention," he said. "I might not make the Hall of Fame, but I think
I can continue to be one of the best players in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   If he has yet to catch the attention of Miami's abused fan base,
Floyd does seem to have caught the attention of a Tampa, Fla.,
resident named George Steinbrenner, the New York Yankee owner who is
reportedly concerned about the sizzling pace of the Boston Red Sox in
the American League East and the lack of production from his
right-field platoon of Shane Spencer and John Vander Wal.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-4, 235 pound Floyd is a left-handed batter who would be
a perfect fit in Yankee Stadium, where one of his best friends,
former Montreal teammate Rondell White, now plays left field. Floyd
is making $6.5 million in the last year of a four-year, $19-million
contract, can become a free agent at the end of the season, and
unless the Marlins sustain their early success and produce a miracle
at the gate, there is little chance they can afford to keep him.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the media drumbeat grew louder last week when the
Marlins moved Floyd from left field to right in a switch with Kevin
Millar. The Marlins said it was done at the suggestion of Millar and
teammates to improve the defense, but media cynics saw it as a
showcase for Yankee scouts.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear whether owner Jeffrey Loria, who simply swapped his
Montreal migraine for one in the sun, would capitulate on his
promising young team by trading Floyd to the Yankees or another team
this early, or wait and examine the situation closer to the July 31
non-waiver trade deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Loria and staff won't confirm or deny the speculation, but it's a
concern in the clubhouse. Outfielder Preston Wilson said that if
Floyd is traded, "You've got to wonder who's next." Wilson pointed
out that he and catcher Charles Johnson also have large contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't Seattle lose Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey and Alex Rodriguez
in three successive years?" he asked. "Trading stars has become part
of the game, but it's just that we've got something special going
here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Floyd, "I honor the uniform I'm wearing, but as much as I
love living and playing here, if you don't want to be in that
[Yankee] situation, you have to be crazy. It's the best in baseball.
Look at the tradition there. It's an honor being mentioned in the
same sentence with the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time, until it happens, if it even does, I have to
try and not think about it. I've been through this kind of thing
before, so that helps. It's out of my control. My main goal is to
help this team be what the Yankees are and get it back to where it
was in '97 [when the Marlins won the World Series, only to be
dismantled by then-owner Wayne Huizenga]."</TE>
<TE>   He is doing all he can in that regard. A physically sound Floyd
had 555 at-bats last year and responded with career highs of 31
homers, 103 runs batted in and .317 average. Through Saturday, he was
tied for third in the majors with 12 homers, had 28 RBIs, was batting
.328 and was among league leaders in slugging and on-base
percentages.</TE>
<TE>   He has become the player the Expos envisioned when they picked
him, a Chicago high school star, in the first round of the 1991 June
draft. His professional progress was sidetracked by a succession of
injuries--a shattered left wrist that threatened his career in 1995,
two knee operations and a torn Achilles' tendon.</TE>
<TE>   He debuted with the Expos in 1993, was traded to Florida in 1997
for pitcher Dustin Hermanson and outfielder Joe Orsulak in one of
those frequent Montreal sell-offs, and until last year had only one
season with 500 or more at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt that if I'm out there for 150 games, I'll bring
something home to help the team," Floyd said. "Dealing with the
injuries was the toughest time of my life, but I haven't heard much
about that label lately. I'm slowly getting that monkey off my back,
and that's big."</TE>
<TE>   So is today. Floyd won't forget Mother's Day, having already
ordered the patio furniture Olivia Floyd has wanted for the backyard
of the house he bought his parents a couple of years ago. Floyd
credits them with helping him through the difficult times. He still
phones them several times a week, looking to his mom for mental
support and his dad, Cornelius, for the mechanical tips he has been
providing since Floyd first lifted a bat.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, "I'm at a point where I just need to be playing
regularly. I have a good plan, a good swing, and I just need the fine
tuning to continue. If you're going to be considered one of the best
players in the game, you can't just have one year of 30 [homers] and
100 [RBIs], a .300 average and 100 runs. You have to do it every
year."</TE>
<TE>   It's a search for the chill in the heat, but the question is, is
he destined to continue the search in the Bronx?</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE HORN ROSS NEWHAN</KH>
<HD>Angels Able to Close Gap Against A's</HD>

<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe the Seattle Mariners are still too far removed-- geographically
and in the American League West standings--to hear the thunder being
produced by the Angels' offense (and maybe apologies are owed to
Manager Mike Scioscia for suggesting the confidence he has shown in
his batters over the last two years was strictly spin control), but
the echoes have to be reverberating in the Oakland A's ears.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have rocked past the A's into second place in the West,
and while it still has to be shown that the 41-game disparity
separating them from the Mariners last season was a one-year illusion
created by Seattle's 116 wins, they seem to have removed the
significance from the 27 games they trailed Oakland in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The A's won 102 games last year, but their vaunted starting
pitchers have lost luster, and it's being suggested in the Bay Area
that the A's have lost their trademark swagger without Jason Giambi.
The A's lost four consecutive games and seven of their last nine
through Saturday, falling eight games behind the Mariners, and
General Manager Billy Beane said, "we don't want to overreact, but we
don't want to underreact either. We have to look in the mirror."</LD>
<TE>   The only Giambi reflection to be seen is that of Jeremy's, but
Beane--in reference to Jason--said the A's should be finding all the
leadership they need on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're getting great starting pitching, it's the best
leadership you can have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland starters led the American League in earned-run average and
were second in wins last year. The Big Three of Mark Mulder, Tim
Hudson and Barry Zito were a combined 56-25. Now they are 7-8, and
A's starters overall were 2-7 with an earned-run average of almost
nine in a 10-game span through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the magic evaporated when Mulder, who was 21-8, was lost
early with a forearm strain. Mulder made his first start since April
11 on Friday night and gave up eight hits and six runs in 41/3
innings of a 6-2 loss to Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder said his arm felt fine but "whether [the concern] is still
in my head or not, I'm not sure."</TE>
<TE>   There is overall concern among the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to roll over and give up, or are we going to
continue to work at it to get better? It's a gut check," outfielder
Terrence Long told the Oakland Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, compounding the rudderless impression, Jason Giambi has
begun to assume more of his familiar leadership role in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "You see his comfort just walking around and watching him take on
more leadership, walking to the mound and talking to pitchers,"
Manager Joe Torre said. "I think they appreciate it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Franco is 41 and probably headed for retirement. The New York
Met closer until the arrival of Armando Benitez, Franco faces elbow
reconstruction and will likely opt to end his pitching career with
422 saves, second to Lee Smith's 455.</TE>
<TE>   If the Brooklyn-born Franco has become synonymous with the Mets
during 13 years in New York, it's generally forgotten that he started
his career with the Dodgers and might have filled the Steve Howe gap
and more except he was traded to Cincinnati for infielder Rafael
Landestoy in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Dusty Baker, the San Francisco Giant manager who was then with the
Dodgers, paid tribute to Franco the other day, calling the
left-hander a fighter who "was a little rookie coming up with us in
L.A. The Dodgers said he was too short, and 20 years later he's still
pitching."</TE>
<TE>   He's not the only pitcher to have his size considered suspect by
earlier Dodger managements. There was a little right-hander named
Pedro Martinez, traded about 10 years after Franco and still
pitching, having won three Cy Young awards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disgusted by the number of pitches directed at Barry Bonds' head
(the latest Thursday from the Mets' Pedro Astacio) and calling for
immediate ejections rather than warnings, Baker said, "It's kind of
bewildering to me because Barry's not clowning, not styling, he's
just playing. You just start thinking like it's the old school, that
there's a bounty on him."</TE>
<TE>   In the old school, it was an eye for an eye and the game went on,
but then old-school graduates would have laughed at two recent
developments.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis Cardinal pitching coach Dave Duncan accused the
Chicago Cub base coaches of relaying pitch locations to Sammy Sosa,
depending on where the Cardinal catchers were setting up (" ... it
would be in their best interest to stop doing it," Duncan said),
angering Sosa and Manager Don Baylor, who called Duncan a liar and
said he was paranoid.</TE>
<TE>   This much is sure: Duncan and Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa, two
exponents of country hardball, know well that in both the old and new
schools, stealing signs and locations was and is a regularly
practiced art--frequently with imaginative methods.</TE>
<TE>   * Then there was the Colorado Rockies revealing they have been
storing baseballs in a humidor-type enclosure to keep leather from
drying and shrinking, which would make the balls travel farther.
Skeptics said the Rockies were going to any length to restrict
offense at Coors Field, but an appropriate humidor doesn't compare to
old-school charges of balls being frozen to reduce scoring, a
frequent accusation lodged against the low-scoring, Go-Go White Sox
in old Comiskey Park.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Alderson, baseball's executive vice president of operations,
launched an immediate investigation into the Coors humidor and
concluded the Rockies are trying to preserve specifications, not
alter them. He said baseball management has discussed instituting an
industry-wide policy, but " ... we didn't want to get into the
business of creating a chain of criminal custody ... [and] having to
police all this."</TE>

<HD>Boston's Ramirez Breaks Finger on Play at Plate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manny Ramirez of the Boston Red Sox broke the index finger on his
left hand when he ran into Seattle Mariner catcher Dan Wilson's shin
guard in the second inning Saturday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez hurt his hand while sliding into the plate while
attempting to score from first base on Shea Hillenbrand's double in
the second. He was tagged out on a headfirst slide as Wilson blocked
the plate.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Sox said Ramirez would fly back to Boston today to be
examined by Dr. Bill Morgan, the team's physician.</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez leads the American League with a .372 batting average. He
has nine homers and runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez made his second start of the season in right field. He was
replaced by Trot Nixon in the bottom of the third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mariner closer Kazuhiro Sasaki signed a two-year contract
extension that takes him through the 2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   The deal includes an option for a third year. Terms were not
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki rejoined the team Saturday, returning from a trip to
Yokohama, Japan, where he went Thursday after his wife, Kaori, became
ill.</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki, 34, would have been eligible for free agency after this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Kazu is an important part of our success the past two seasons,"
General Manager Pat Gillick said. "In his role as closer, he is a key
member of our bullpen and we are pleased to know he'll be here
through at least 2004."</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki, who set a Japanese career record with 229 saves from
1990-99, said his signing with the Mariners on the day of his return
to Seattle from Japan was a coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew my agent and the Mariners were talking and it was getting
close," he said through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   "I found out it was ready to sign just before I came back to the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Allard Baird, general manager of the Kansas City
Royals, said he "would anticipate" that a manager would be selected
within the next week to replace Tony Muser, fired April 29.</TE>
<TE>   Baird has interviewed Bucky Dent, a former New York Yankee manager
who is managing the Royals' triple-A Omaha club; Houston Astro coach
Tony Pena; Buck Showalter, who has managed Arizona and the Yankees,
and Royal interim Manager John Mizerock.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free agent Wil Cordero signed with the Montreal Expos, the latest
player to return this season for a second stint with the troubled
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero, released by Cleveland on April 29 with 999 career hits,
became the third former Expo--after Andres Galarraga and Henry
Rodriguez--to rejoin the team in what probably will be its final
season.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Venezuelan began his career with the Expos, from
1992-95.</TE>
<TE>   He played in the 1994 All-Star game and won the NL shortstop
Silver Slugger award after batting .294 with 30 doubles, 15 homers
and 63 runs batted in during the strike-abbreviated season.</TE>

<HD>Trinidad Wins, Hopes for Rematch With Hopkins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>Felix Trinidad moved a step closer to a middleweight title fight
Saturday night, stopping French journeyman Hacine Cherifi in the
fourth round.</LD>
<LD>   Trinidad landed a right to the face that sent Cherifi to the
canvas in the fourth. Cherifi got up, but Trinidad ended the fight by
flooring Cherifi again with a right and a left hook to the jaw.</LD>
<LD>   Trinidad, fighting for first time since losing to Bernard Hopkins
in September in a bid to unify the middleweight titles, improved to
40-1 with his 34th knockout.</LD>
<TE>   "I want Hopkins!" the 29-year-old Trinidad said. "I will chop his
neck. Tito Trinidad is back."</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad outboxed Cherifi (32-6-1) from the opening bell to the
delight of his home fans at Roberto Clemente Colisseum, knocking him
down in the third with a right hook to the face.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad weighed in at 160 pounds, the maximum for the
middleweight division.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad said that his main goal is to get a rematch with Hopkins
before the end of the year, although that could change depending on
his promoter's plans.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be a change if Don King wants me to fight Oscar De La
Hoya, but I want Hopkins," Trinidad said. "I'm not saying I don't
want De La Hoya, because I do, but I want Hopkins first."</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad, who has held the welterweight, super welterweight and
middleweight crowns, handed De La Hoya his first loss in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins has said that he's willing to give Trinidad a rematch.</TE>

<HD>It's Lame Canada No More in the NHL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With three Canadian teams still alive in the NHL playoffs and Toronto
or Ottawa guaranteed to reach the Eastern Conference finals, Canada
has wrested part of its national sport back from its neighbors to the
south, at least for the moment.</LD>
<LD>   That's only just, writes Woody Paige of the Denver Post:</LD>
<LD>   "Ten million people live in Ontario, Canada, and all but eight
play hockey.</LD>
<TE>   "Those eight are degenerates, ruffed grouse or basketball
players."</TE>
<TE>   In the other Eastern Conference semifinal, the storied Montreal
Canadiens are playing the not-so-storied Carolina Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Call that the Habs versus the Hab-nots.</TE>
<TE>   Penalty phase: For an inkling of how seriously Canadians take
their hockey, consider that the Toronto Sun publishes a critique of
every penalty called in Maple Leaf games, noting the referees, the
situation, and assessing whether the call was accurate.</TE>
<TE>   The best part might be the headline: "Whine Tasting."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which Canadian team is the most recent to reach the
Stanley Cup finals?</TE>
<TE>   Skating ahead: The Hurricanes have one advantage over the
Canadiens. They have Kristi Yamaguchi.</TE>
<TE>   The former Olympic skating champion is married to Carolina
defenseman Bret Hedican, and she visited the Canadiens' Molson Centre
with the Stars on Ice tour April 30.</TE>
<TE>   When the Hurricanes arrived at the arena last week, they were
greeted by handwritten signs left by Yamaguchi in the visitors'
locker room, the training room and the coaches' office that read, "Go
Hurricanes."</TE>
<TE>   "She told me she did it, but there was no way I expected them to
still be here," Hedican said.</TE>
<TE>   Most Valuable News Conference: The New York Times' Mike Wise
compared and contrasted Allen Iverson's "profane, Tysonesque rant"
last week with Tim Duncan's humble news conference after succeeding
Iverson as MVP.</TE>
<TE>   "Two faces of the NBA, held up for public inspection. Bad guy/good
guy, the ground floor of sports-star perception. Just like a Western
movie, you can root for and against someone. It's almost too easy.</TE>
<TE>   "More complex and harder to grasp is the difference between this
year's and last year's MVP.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning made Iverson's misogynistic rap lyrics less of an
enticing story. He was not so different when the 76ers began their
improbable run to the finals a year ago. There were just more reasons
to like him, to allow him into the mainstream because he played so
hard and his team won."</TE>
<TE>   Add Duncan: It's a little-known fact, Wise writes, that "Duncan
has tattoos and a pierced tongue and he is one of the most
uncooperative players when it comes to interviews. It's not a big
deal. He does not fit the profile, so that part of him is left
unexamined."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Vancouver Canucks, who lost to the New York
Rangers in the 1994 finals. Before that, at least one Canadian team
reached the finals 10 of the previous 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The last word on the proliferation of bowl games
comes from USA Today's Mike Lopresti: "Oh, good. Three more bowl
games. We need them like we need three more Taco Bells."</TE>

<HD>Green's Position: It's Not an Issue to Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Shawn Green is under the microscope for his slow start at the plate
and approach in right field, making things uncomfortable for the
Dodgers too.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dan Evans traded Gary Sheffield in part because
Green emerged as a team leader last season while setting a franchise
record with 49 home runs, and the Dodgers figured Green was ready to
shoulder more responsibility. Green has been in a season-long
slump--hitting only .252 with three home runs and 21 runs batted
in--and his performance in the field has raised eyebrows.</LD>
<LD>   A few catchable balls have dropped in front of Green recently,
prompting Manager Jim Tracy to talk to him about positioning. In the
ninth inning of Friday's 4-3 loss to the Florida Marlins at Pro
Player Stadium, Green froze on a catchable line drive hit by Eric
Owens, who scored the winning run after getting a leadoff double.</LD>
<TE>   Green said too much has been made of a few plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say it's an issue," he said. "There have been a couple
of balls where they [team officials] said I should have been playing
in a different place. If they want me to move, I'll move."</TE>
<TE>   Green won a Gold Glove in 1999 with the Toronto Blue Jays and had
a reputation of being a good outfielder during five-plus seasons in
the American League. However, scouts who follow the Dodgers have not
been particularly impressed with Green's fielding since he joined the
club in 2000 after signing a six-year, $84-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he is receptive to the suggestions of Tracy and the
coaching staff, but there's only so much he can do.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the scouting reports; I go by my experiences against
different hitters," he said. "I've always played guys differently in
different situations, but like I said, I'll do whatever they want me
to. But guys are going to get hits in front of me and over my head."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to improve the sputtering offense, Tracy plans to
keep Paul Lo Duca in the cleanup spot behind Green.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who has batted fourth seven times this season, has been
in a groove although he has only two homers, providing the club's
best run-production option because Brian Jordan is struggling as
well. Tracy hopes Green gets better pitches to hit batting in front
of Lo Duca.</TE>
<TE>   "How good offensively are we capable of being? I don't know the
answer to that question," Tracy said. "But I do know this: In order
for us to reach to where I could get to that assessment, I do know
that we've got to get Shawn Green going. That is the reason for
[batting Lo Duca cleanup]."</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's 3-0 victory over the Marlins, Lo Duca was hitless in
four at-bats, grounding into two double plays, striking out and
reaching on an error. Green was one for four, singling and reaching
on an error.</TE>

<HD>For Brown, It's Like Old Times</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He rebounds from consecutive losses by striking
out 10 in seven innings in 3-0 victory over Marlins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Overshadowed in the Dodger rotation for the first time, Kevin Brown
suddenly has something to prove.</LD>
<LD>   Newcomers have been more successful while Brown continues to
recover from last season's elbow surgery and aftereffects, providing
new challenges for an ornery 37-year-old right-hander determined to
maintain his standing.</LD>
<LD>   Brown apparently won't go quietly, rebounding from consecutive
losses with a stirring seven-inning outing Saturday night in a 3-0
victory over the Florida Marlins at Pro Player Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Brown (2-3) turned back the clock before 19,767 where he helped
the Marlins win the 1997 World Series championship, giving up only
three hits and getting a season-high 10 strikeouts. Starter Julian
Tavarez (1-2) worked four innings for the Marlins, whose season-high
winning streak ended at five games.</TE>
<TE>   "I was having trouble catching [the ball]; I thought I was in a
boxing match for the first couple of innings," Dodger catcher Paul Lo
Duca said. "The movement on his ball was just unbelievable, it was
going every which way.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a great slider and a great curveball. Toward the last
three innings, his split-finger was just dominating. It's a great
sign for us."</TE>
<TE>   Brown struck out the side in the first after the Marlins loaded
the bases, then got into a rhythm the Marlins couldn't interrupt.</TE>
<TE>   They had only two more baserunners against Brown, who hit Preston
Wilson with a two-out pitch in the third and gave up a one-out triple
to Derrek Lee in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek's bases-loaded double in the fourth provided all
the support Brown and relievers Paul Quantrill and Eric Gagne needed,
and the three-run cushion seemed much bigger with the way Brown was
pitching.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne worked the ninth for his 12th save in 13 opportunities,
completing the victory for a stubborn staff ace who hasn't
relinquished his title.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out and he had an agenda tonight," said Marlin All-Star
catcher Charles Johnson, Brown's teammate on the Marlins' World
Series title team. "The first inning, we got a couple of hits, a
couple of balls hit hard, and other than that it was kind of lights
out. His sinker was just devastating tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen him like that before. I've seen him when he was almost
unhittable. Tonight was one of those nights."</TE>
<TE>   Brown maintained the signature command that has eluded him at
times this season, walking one while throwing 60 strikes in 87
pitches. He baffled the Marlins with a hard sinker, moving forkball
and late-breaking slider, reminding the Dodgers what he does best and
giving the Marlins too much to handle.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he answered that question tonight, I would say," said
Manager Jim Tracy, referring to some suggesting Brown is no longer a
No. 1-type starter. "That was vintage Kevin Brown that you saw
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "They start the game off, they get two baserunners, they have
second and third and nobody out. He strikes out the side and the next
hit they get is the triple that Derrek Lee hits in the seventh
inning."</TE>
<TE>   Brown had struggled to regain his form while still recovering from
elbow surgery, and the process was further complicated when he was
put on the 15-day disabled list April 14 because of scar tissue and
swelling around the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Although Brown did not pitch poorly in losing his first two starts
since having been activated, something was missing.</TE>
<TE>   He rediscovered it Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely was a lot better than what it has been," said
Brown, who lowered his earned-run average from 4.44 to 3.45. "You
have ups and downs when you haven't had surgery. I'm encouraged by
the fact that it felt a lot better tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are too.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that every time Brownie goes out there, when he's healthy
like now, he gives us a chance to win," Gagne said. "He hasn't been
healthy, but you can tell he is now. That's the real Brownie tonight,
and that's great for us."</TE>

<LD>Ernie Els made a big charge early and Phil Mickelson staggered down
the stretch. At the end of a hot and gusty day in the Byron Nelson
Classic at Irving, Texas, Saturday, everyone was in the same
situation--trying to catch Shigeki Maruyama.</LD>
<LD>   Maruyama, the second-round leader, holed a seven-foot birdie putt
on the 18th hole for a two-under 68 that gave him a three-stroke lead
over Cameron Beckman.</LD>
<LD>   Maruyama recovered from two bogeys in the middle of his round by
making a great par save from the thick rough on No. 15, and his
birdie on the 18th put him at 12-under 198 through three rounds.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time Maruyama has held the 54-hole lead on the
PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Beckman earned a spot in the last group with a 66, the best score
among late starters when the gusts approached 30 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Els shot a bogey-free 64 to move into a tie for third at
seven-under 203 in a group that included past Nelson champion Loren
Roberts (68) and Lee Janzen (70). Mickelson, who moved to nine under
and only one stroke out of the lead, finished with a 71 and is at six
under. Tiger Woods was another stroke back at five under after a 69.</TE>
<TE>   Woods plodded along with pars, but birdies on two of his last
three holes gave him a 69 and left him at 205, needing another low
round today to have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen-year-old rookie Natalie Gulbis shot a career-best
six-under 66 to take a one-stroke lead after the third round of the
Aerus Electrolux USA Championship at Franklin, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Gulbis, playing only her seventh event since joining the LPGA Tour
full-time, birdied four of the first seven holes and finished with
seven birdies and only one bogey to reach 11 under.</TE>
<TE>   Brandie Burton, the leader after two rounds, shot a 70 to drop
into a tie with Pat Hurst (67) at 10-under 206. Annika Sorenstam (70)
is two strokes back along with Grace Park (67).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Lietzke shot an eight-under 64 to take a two-stroke lead
over Larry Nelson after the second round of the TD Waterhouse
Championship at Kansas City, Mo. Lietzke finished at 11-under 133 on
the soaked Tiffany Greens course, which could be unplayable for
today's final round if another round of thunderstorms rolls in as
forecast. Nelson shot 66.... England's Barry Lane shot a
course-record seven-under 65 to take a two-stroke lead in the Benson
and Hedges International at Sutton Coldfield, England. John Daly shot
a 74 to drop seven strokes back.</TE>

<HD>Global Finance Pays Dividends in Nursery</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the betting public, trainer Jerry Dutton was not stunned
Saturday by Global Finance's victory at 7-10 in the $85,580 Nursery
Stakes at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   What Dutton, who won the race for the fourth time since 1996,
found surprising was the manner in which the 2-year-old End Sweep
filly got the job done.</LD>
<LD>   Showing more early speed than her trainer and co-owner thought she
would, the 7-10 favorite put away pacesetter Forthelifeofme after
three furlongs and drew away in the stretch. At the wire, she and
jockey David Flores had four lengths on 5-1 second choice Magic Smoke
and completed the five furlongs in 583/5.</LD>
<TE>   Joining Starry Ice, Wired To Fly and Golden Ballet as Dutton-owned
and trained winners of the Nursery in the last seven years, Global
Magic earned her second win in three starts and both victories have
come in Inglewood. In her debut, she was seventh of 10 in a
two-furlong race at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew she would finish, but she started a little quicker than I
thought she would," said Dutton, who owns the filly with wife
Barbara. "I was left wondering a little, but it worked out well just
the way it was."</TE>
<TE>   With Kent Desormeaux in Texas for the Lone Star Derby, where he
finished last with Holdthehelm, Flores became the third different
rider on the winner and he was impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she is a very talented filly," he said. "The farther she
goes, I think she'll be even better. I just put her in a good spot
today to make it easier for me.</TE>
<TE>   "She got a little tired around the turn and then she jumped
forward, so that was a great sign. At the top of the stretch, she was
pricking her ears a little and made it home easy."</TE>
<TE>   Outrun early after breaking a bit slowly, Magic Smoke finished
strongly for second, two lengths in front of Forthelifeofme, then
came Silver Shot, Singing Swiss and Enduring Freedom. Bronx Tale and
Newport Nikki were scratched earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wiseman's Ferry made his first stakes victory a lucrative one with
a wire-to-wire victory in the $500,000 Lone Star Derby at Lone Star
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Morton Fink, Lee Sacks and Swifty Farms and trained by
Niall O'Callaghan, the 3-year-old Hennessy colt wasn't bothered
breaking from the outside post in the field of 14.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Jorge Chavez, who was also the jockey when he won for
the first time in this country over a sloppy track at Keeneland on
April 14, Wiseman's Ferry, a 7-1 longshot, completed the 11/8 miles
in 1:494/5.</TE>
<TE>   Tracemark, trained by Craig Dollase and ridden by Alex Solis, was
second, nearly three lengths back, and it was another three lengths
to 22-1 Peekskill. Smoked Em, the 3-1 favorite who was ridden by
Chris McCarron, was fifth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mellow Fellow, who could have been claimed for $40,000 earlier
this year, made it six consecutive victories by defeating Explicit,
favored Swept Overboard and three others in the $200,000 Bay Meadows
Breeders' Cup Sprint Handicap at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Russell Baze and trained by Bill Morey Jr., who owns the
gelding in partnership with Bart Heller, Mellow Fellow ($7.20)
completed the six furlongs in 1:081/5.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-year-old, who was claimed by Morey for $20,000 out of his
first career start in 1998, has won 11 of 24 and is four of five at
Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left Bank, the 3-10 favorite, made a successful 2002 debut,
winning the $102,900 Bold Ruler Handicap against only three opponents
at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Michael Tabor and trained by Todd Pletcher, the
5-year-old French Deputy horse won for the 12th time in 21 starts by
beating 16-1 longshot Silky Sweep by a length in 1:091/5 for the six
furlongs. John Velasquez was aboard the winner, who is scheduled to
run May 27 in the $750,000 Metropolitan Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Two races later, Nonsuch Bay, an 11-1 longshot, rallied between
horses late and got up to beat 9-2 fourth choice Wopping by a nose in
the $200,000 Nassau Breeders' Cup Stakes.</TE>

<HD>Junqueira's Jump-Start Has Him on Indy Pole</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The scenario was taken from Rick Mears' playbook on how to win the
Indianapolis 500 pole--get an early starting position, set a fast
time and defy the rest of the field to match you.</LD>
<LD>   Brazilian Bruno Junqueira was the first qualifier on a cold,
dreary and water-logged Saturday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and
after he ran 10 laps at 231.342 mph he had to wait nearly seven hours
before the pole position for the May 26 race was his for sure.</LD>
<LD>   Only Robbie Buhl, a six-time 500 starter from Lakewood, Ohio,
prevented the day from becoming a Brazilian holiday. His 231.033
average speed put him alongside Junqueira, a native of Belo
Horizonte, and just ahead of old-timer Raul Boesel of Curitiba and
Sao Paulo neighbors Felipe Giaffone and Tony Kanaan, a rookie.</LD>
<TE>   Despite two rain interruptions, 24 cars qualified and six others
made attempts. Among the big names who missed and are hoping to make
the 33-car field today or next Sunday are former two-time winner Arie
Luyendyk, Paul Tracy, Dario Franchitti and A. J. Foyt's two drivers,
Greg Ray and Airton Dare.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the longest seven hours of my life," said the 5-foot-7,
148-pound Junqueira. "I went from the transporter to the garage to
the pits, back and forth. The worst was about 3 o'clock when I was
resting in the garage and I saw Buhl's 231 pop up on the screen. I
didn't know it was his second lap (after a 229.576) so I was very
nervous for a few moments."</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira collected $100,000 for his pole run. The last driver to
win the pole at Indy as the first qualifier was Emerson Fittipaldi in
1990. It was Fittipaldi who started the Brazilian invasion of
American open-wheel racing.</TE>
<TE>   Buhl wasn't the only surprise for the Dreyer &amp; Reinhold Racing
team. Sarah Fisher, Buhl's teammate and protege, registered the
biggest improvement of qualifying when she placed her G Force car
eighth at 229.439. Her fastest practice lap before Saturday had been
226.970.</TE>
<TE>   The day's biggest surprise, however, may have been the
semi-retired Boesel flying in from South America to put John Menard's
car on the outside of the front row. Boesel, 44, only got the ride
after a crash by PJ Jones, who had replaced Menard's No. 1 driver,
Jacques Lazier, under similar circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has gone through so much emotionally the last few weeks
since Jacques went down," said Menard. "It's just such a hard thing
to get everyone on the same page emotionally with a new driver. Then
to have the same thing happen to PJ, it's been the toughest month of
May I can ever remember.</TE>
<TE>   "But I can't say enough about what Raul's done and what my team
has done here in such a short amount of time. One thing we knew, Raul
has the experience."</TE>
<TE>   Boesel first drove in the 500 in 1985. He finished third in 1989
and fourth in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira, almost an afterthought in Chip Ganassi's Target team
plans this year, also had the day's fastest single lap of 231.635
around the 2.5-mile, four-cornered oval in one of Ganassi's
Chevy-powered G Force cars.</TE>
<TE>   When Ganassi, who won the 500 in 2000 with Juan Montoya of
Colombia, revamped his driver lineup for 2002, he first signed Kenny
Brack for his CART team and started an Indy Racing League team with
Jeff Ward. For Brack's teammate, Ganassi sought Franchitti and
Kanaan, but when neither was available, he reluctantly resigned
Junqueira.</TE>
<TE>   The decision has paid dividends. Junqueira, 25, won a CART
oval-track race two weeks ago in Motegi, Japan, driving a
Toyota-powered car to the first win for a Japanese manufacturer in
its home country.</TE>
<TE>   Because Junqueira is a CART driver and the 500 is an IRL race, he
and other CART crossovers had to drive IRL chassis-engine
combinations.</TE>
<TE>   Only Robby Gordon, who qualified 11th, is planning to drive in the
Winston Cup Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, N.C., after driving in the
500. Ganassi, however, will have favorites in both--Junqueira here
and points leader Sterling Marlin in the nightcap.</TE>
<TE>   Five rookies, headed by CART veteran Kanaan, qualified for their
first 500. Three, Frenchman Laurent Redon, Rick Treadway and Max
Papis, another CART driver, occupy the sixth row together.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's surprising run, which placed her ahead of such favorites
as Al Unser Jr., Gordon and South African rookie sensation Tomas
Scheckter, also made her the fastest woman qualifier in Indy 500
history. It bettered the 225.345 by Lyn St. James in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Robbie Buhl is the most awesome teammate ever," said Fisher, 21.
"Our first objective was try and get Robbie on the pole, so I didn't
get up to speed as quickly as I had hoped. He shared everything with
me, and once we got Robbie's setup where we wanted, we just went from
there on my car.</TE>
<TE>   "The car was perfectly settled to the point where it gave me a
feeling of 'oomph, there it is,' every time I turned it. Today we
accomplished exactly what we were aiming for in qualifications."</TE>
<TE>   Not so fortunate was Michael Andretti, who qualified for his 13th
500 but is in what may be a precarious position. After accepting a
226.780 mph speed, he is the 23rd qualifier, ahead of only Billy
Boat. Either or both could be bumped by faster cars next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "With the potential weather conditions over the next few days, we
decided to take Michael's run," said Kim Green, manager of Team
Green. "Keep in mind that 226.780 is above last year's pole speed. If
suddenly a lot of cars are able to find some speed and put us in
jeopardy, we'll be able to make another attempt in our backup car."</TE>
<TE>   It was a bad day for Team Green, which saw Tracy severely damage
his car during a crash in morning warmups, and Franchitti experience
engine problems as he pulled into the pits before making a
qualification attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran, who finished one-two last
year for Marlboro Team Penske, had lackluster qualifying runs. They
will start next to each other in the fifth row.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think we're in good shape because we are in the show,"
said Castroneves. "It's a 500-mile event over three and a half hours
with six or seven pit stops, so it doesn't really matter where you
start."</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, you were Rick Mears, who won three of his four
500s from the pole and started his other victory in the front row.</TE>

<LD>If recent form holds, Bosque Redondo will not win the $150,000 Mervyn
LeRoy Handicap today at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-year-old Mane Minister horse will be ridden by Chris
McCarron, who won the Grade II last year, and no jockey has repeated
in the LeRoy since Kent Desormeaux won with Marquetry in 1993, a year
after he had won with Another Review.</LD>
<LD>   Based on recent form, Bosque Redondo is the one to beat in the
11/16-mile race, which is the first prep for the $750,000 Hollywood
Gold Cup on July 14.</LD>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan and trained by
Paco Gonzalez, who won the LeRoy in 1994 with Del Mar Dennis, Bosque
Redondo won two in a row at Santa Anita. After beating Reba's Gold by
a head in the Tokyo City Handicap on March 9, the chestnut won the
San Bernardino Handicap by a head over Mysterious Cat on April 6.</TE>
<TE>   The horse Bosque Redondo will have to catch is Sky Jack, who has
won all three of his races at Hollywood Park. Last after being cooked
on a quick pace in the Santa Anita Handicap, the 6-year-old gelding
will break from the rail and he has trained well for his first start

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Fast times coming in the Original Cowbell Dome.</LD>
<LD>   Now Kings of Texas, too, No. 1-seeded Sacramento is coming home
with a 3-1 lead in this Western Conference semifinal series, after
rallying from 14 points behind Saturday without Peja Stojakovic,
losing Chris Webber and Vlade Divac to fouls, and still defeating the
high-powered Dallas Mavericks in overtime, 115-113.</LD>
<LD>   "We got good production out of everybody and they beat us," said
deflated Maverick Coach Don Nelson. "I think that says something
about them."</LD>
<TE>   The Kings are feeling good about themselves again after averaging
112.5 points in this series, winning twice here--they're 3-1 on the
road this postseason--and watching their role players outplay the
young Maverick stars.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Mike Bibby, playing in his first postseason, scored 24
points and the biggest ones, too, driving the lane for a left-handed
layup to tie the score at the end of regulation, then driving the
baseline for a right-handed layup for the winning basket with 12
seconds left in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has averaged 21.5 points in the series, outscoring the more
celebrated Steve Nash, 86-81.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve has had one good game," noted Nelson before Game 4, "but
Bibby has had three."</TE>
<TE>   Make that four.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's only problem," said Webber, the old Jason Williams fan,
"he's so good, he got drafted by a terrible team [the Vancouver
Grizzlies, who traded him for Williams last summer] and had to play
there for three seasons....</TE>
<TE>   "With this point guard that we have, every game that he plays, he
shows you something different. And he shows you that he's a point
guard. I feel great that I have a true point guard, one that he can
either score 20 ... or he can get 20 assists, and it's all about what
he wants to do....</TE>
<TE>   "I hope people do start talking about him more, but if they don't,
that's OK because I know him. I know he'll put that aside and try to
punch somebody the next time we play them."</TE>
<TE>   With Stojakovic out with a badly sprained ankle, this looked like
a long day for the Kings when the Mavericks hit them with a 12-1 run
to open the game.</TE>
<TE>   But then the Mavericks' layup-line defense began parting to let
various Kings stroll to the hoop and the shootout was on again.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings trailed, 54-51, at the half, by 14 in the third quarter
and 12 in the fourth quarter until never-say-die Bobby Jackson scored
13 points in a 17-4 run that popped the Kings into the lead for the
first time, obliging Nelson to sit Nick Van Exel, who'd been guarding
Jackson, more or less.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is normally the Kings' No. 3 guard.</TE>
<TE>   He started the game because Stojakovic was out but did nothing in
the first half, taking five shots and missing four.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby's the kind of guy, you've just kind of got to let him go,"
said King Coach Rick Adelman. "If he's on the court enough minutes,
something's going to happen. Could be bad, but lots of times it's
very good."</TE>
<TE>   With the lead see-sawing back and forth, Webber fouled out with
4:45 left, followed to the bench by Divac with 3:56 left in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks then wilted as the Kings beat them to loose ball
after loose ball and rebound after rebound, getting 12 shots in the
overtime to six for Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after missing eight shots in three possessions while the
Mavericks missed two and turned the ball over once, Bibby drove the
baseline, into the empty heart of the Maverick defense and laid the
ball up for the winning basket.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, asked if he'd throw the full arsenal at Adelman in Game 5,
broke out laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's seen the full arsenal all four games," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, it's not enough.</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson are buds again, or close enough,
and maybe Brian Shaw gets the credit for keeping it that way.</LD>
<LD>   It was the veteran Shaw who intercepted O'Neal when the center and
his coach appeared headed for an Iversonian moment in Game 3, and
Shaw who soothed O'Neal when the outcome of the game was in doubt.</LD>
<LD>   In the second quarter, Malik Rose took two offensive rebounds over
O'Neal, and Jackson was irked. When the team came off for a timeout,
Jackson said as much to O'Neal, who smirked and waved Jackson away.
Moments later, as Jackson tapped at his clipboard with a marker,
O'Neal stood and half-turned away.</LD>
<TE>   "Phil knows how to push Shaq's buttons," Shaw said. "I saw that
Shaq was about to lash out. I wanted to be a calming influence."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Shaw, a teammate of O'Neal's in Orlando and one of
his closest friends, put out both hands and pressed his palms to the
floor. O'Neal shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil made his point and I think it was eating away at Shaq," Shaw
said. "But, he did show more activity after that."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is talking again, sort of. He gathered a few media outlets
to the side of his trainers' table Saturday afternoon, and was quite
charming. "I'm fine," he said. "I've taken a week off, because in
this league, when you speak the truth, you get fined for it. So, I'd
rather just hold my thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   When O'Neal says things like that, usually it means he's angry
with the referees, who call the game, and the league, which he
believes does not protect him from cheap shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After watching Kobe Bryant go five for five in the fourth quarter
on Friday, when the Lakers left a close game behind, Spur forward
Steve Smith said Bryant finishes games with the flair of Michael
Jordan, Magic Johnson, and others.</TE>
<TE>   "He closed the game like one of the greats," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Often, it was at the expense of Antonio Daniels.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing everything that's humanly possible to do on the
greatest perimeter player in the world," Spur Coach Gregg Popovich
said. "[Bryant] is an astounding player. You don't see too many
people finger roll lobs."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant took an alley-oop pass from Rick Fox in the fourth quarter.
When he found himself too far from the rim, Bryant flipped the ball
in for an 83-80 Laker lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe has the best in-between game in the league," Popovich said.
"He doesn't live at the three-point line, he doesn't live at the
rim."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did not have a turnover in the first half of Game 3 and
committed nine in the game, only six of which Jackson considered
unforced errors. That, he said, helped win the game, particularly one
in which O'Neal was limping.</TE>
<TE>   "That's efficiency for us," he said. "We have to feel good about
that. The aspect that we didn't give them as many second shots. We
beat them at the second-opportunity chances and the fastbreak, and
those statistics make a big difference."</TE>

<DH>O'Neal, likening relationship to that of president and
general, says he and Jackson 'will always be OK'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>On the afternoon before Game 4, Shaquille O'Neal sat on a padded
table in a back room of the visitor's locker room at the Alamodome
while his teammates practiced.</LD>
<LD>   He looked a little sad.</LD>
<LD>   Two red wires ran from a black box to his left ankle, and as he
spoke he flicked his thumbnail at the half-dozen or so stitches on
the last crease of his right forefinger.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not angry at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Quiet for going on a week, O'Neal had a few things to say about
his relationship with Phil Jackson, the state of his game, and all
that ails him. Displeased with a once-sturdy body that has failed him
in so many small places, he sat and talked from behind soft brown
eyes for as long as the questions came on Saturday afternoon, and as
trainer Gary Vitti soothed his aching parts. O'Neal was treated for
sprains in both ankles, though the left is considered more severe.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Phil will always be OK," he said. "Phil's just the
president, I'm the general. We have a competitive locker room and
that's how it's going to be."</TE>
<TE>   He said the locker room, their personalities, and the nature of
their three-peat desires allow discussions like the one they had
earlier this week, in which Jackson attempted to determine O'Neal's
fitness and O'Neal bristled.</TE>
<TE>   "And it'll never turn into what [Allen] Iverson and Larry Brown
are going through," O'Neal said. "That's nothing against Iverson. I
think he's a great player. But I'm the type of person that I won't
let it go that far, because when you're dealing with rank, even if
your superior officer is wrong, you have to take it with a grain of
salt. Or, you get penalized. If he says something for psychological
reasons, I say something for psychological reasons. But, it'll never
be serious.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a feud. I respect order. I'm the general. I run the
troops. He runs the government. We have a very competitive
government. He's going to say some things, I'm going to say some
things back. His rank is higher than mine, but my rank still has
power too."</TE>
<TE>   No one really called it a feud, but there was a tiff, and it bled
into Game 3, won by the Lakers on Friday night. Up, two games to one,
on the San Antonio Spurs in the best-of-seven Western Conference
semifinals, they'll play Game 4 today at the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   The concern now is O'Neal and his left ankle. He took a
respectable 15 rebounds on Friday, many without leaving the floor.
Downplayed in the days leading to Game3, the sprained ankle slowed
O'Neal further, though there seemed to be no doubt he would play
today.</TE>
<TE>   The order, from most to least severe: ankle, finger, toe. That's
off from a few days ago, when clearly it was finger, toe, ankle, and
from a few days before that, when it was toe, finger, and the swollen
ankle was yet a glimmer in Vitti's eye.</TE>
<TE>   The sum of them all has kept O'Neal closer to the floor, closer to
the basket, and closer to the 50% line, in terms of field-goal
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He had 22 points along with the 15 rebounds, a line he called
"against my religion."</TE>
<TE>   Proud, he hates that it appears he is being outplayed in places,
or that Malik Rose, or David Robinson, or even Tim Duncan, can play
with him over the length of games.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I satisfied? No, of course not, because I'm used to playing at
such a high level," he said. "As long as you guys notice there's no
one outplaying me, as long as you notice it's not skills versus
skills, you know ...</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a couple steps slow, and these other guys are playing with
such energy, because they want to beat us. It makes them appear to be
good players, when actually they're not."</TE>
<TE>   By all appearances, and O'Neal did not disagree, he will carry
these injuries for as long as the Lakers play into spring. It seems
probably he will have surgery on his arthritic big right toe after
the season, and the ankle sprain and finger laceration will heal on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he can lead them while in this condition, he said,
"Hopefully I can. Hopefully I can."</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, who had 31 points, six assists and one turnover in 48
minutes on Friday, will have to fill a few of the places O'Neal
cannot go.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry and Samaki Walker will be a little lonelier on
Duncan, and on the next power forward, assuming there is one.</TE>
<TE>   "If my teammates keep playing like they're playing, they can hold
it down while I get my wheels realigned," O'Neal said, laughing a
little for the first time. "I've got Gary working on my wheels right
now. He's chroming my rims back up.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm sitting on some 18-inch aluminums, and I'm used to
rolling on some chromed-out dubs. So, right now they're in the shop
getting the chrome back up. I'll be back on the boulevard in no
time."</TE>

<LD>Handicappers who like a sharp horse stepping up should take a look at
tonight's fifth race at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Icey Gambler, a 7-year-old gelded son of Prospectors Gamble, will
try for his third win in a row in the fifth, a $5,000 claimer for
thoroughbreds at 4 1/2 furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Co-owned by Felix Gonzalez and Raymond Salvatore, and trained by
Gonzalez, Icey Gambler beat $2,000 foes on April 11, then dominated
$3,200 foes on April 26 and a horse who finished behind him (Cielo
Apache) came back to win big on Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   A winner of seven of 42 races in his career, Icey Gambler will
break from Post 7 in the field of eight and will be ridden by Victor
Diaz.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, his opposition includes Extraordinary Cop,
Nashua's Asset, C R Fox, Brite Future, Purdue Castle, George's Hope
and Mr. Rambler.</TE>
<TE>   The main event this evening is a $12,500 allowance at 350 yards
that attracted Nordick Only VM Brz, who made a successful U.S. debut
with a neck victory at 6-5 on April 20.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Means will ride for trainer Jaime Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Murmuring Sea. 2. Lodi Lou. 3. Bobbin Lee. 4. Let It
Snow Cash. 5. Icey Gambler. 6. Seeks Joy. 7. Ms Monji. 8. Dashing
Pro. 9. Nordick Only VM Brz. 10. Special Flying Jet.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Murmuring Sea in the first, use Lodi Lou and La
Yahaliea in the second, Bobbin Lee, Defrere R.N. and Chill's Rose in
the third and Let It Snow Cash, Loves That Gold, Red Hot Speed and
Peggy Perfect in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: The appaloosa Four Oh One K could improve in
his second after a long layoff in the sixth at 870 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Flight 243 returns at the claimed level for sharp trainer Jorge
Farias in the 10th at 350 yards.</TE>

<HD>If Mathis Leaves, MLS Could Lose Its Shirt</HD>
<DH>Soccer: U.S. national team forward drawing interest from
Europe, and a strong World Cup could land him there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sometime before summer turns to fall, Clint Mathis is going to score
a goal, rip off his jersey and reveal a T-shirt emblazoned with these
words: "Ich Lieber Munich."</LD>
<LD>   Then again, if things work out differently, it could be: "Amo
Perugia."</LD>
<LD>   And if they don't work out at all, well, there's always that old
standby hanging in the closet. You know, the T-shirt that reads "I
Love New York," which Mathis displayed when he joined the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars after leaving the Galaxy three seasons
ago.</LD>
<TE>   These days, Mathis is the United States' hottest scorer, with five
goals in his last eight games for the national team going into
today's match against Uruguay at RFK Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Much to the dismay of Major League Soccer, he is also the hottest
American property in the league and, as such, has caught the eye of
several clubs in Europe, most notably Bayern Munich of the German
Bundesliga and Perugia of Italy's Serie A.</TE>
<TE>   If Mathis has a good World Cup--in other words, he scores two or
three goals against Portugal, South Korea and Poland, the U.S. team's
three first-round opponents--his price will rise.</TE>
<TE>   So the Germans--who saw Mathis score two goals against their own
national team in March--and the Italians are trying to strike a deal
now.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis visited Munich in late April, just before joining the U.S.
team for its 10-day camp in Cary, N.C. His agent, Craig Sharon,
afterward stopped by to see what Perugia had to offer. The transfer
fee Mathis could command might approach the $6.5 million that
Sunderland of the English Premier League last December paid Rangers
of Scotland for U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Sakiewicz, general manager of the MetroStars, said any club
interested in acquiring Mathis would have to pay "well north of $3
million," and MLS, which controls all player contracts, is likely to
ask even more for one of its marquee Americans, especially if it is
expected to release him before the end of the MLS season in October.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the buzz surrounding Mathis' future is not affecting the
U.S. team's preparations for the May 31-June 30 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't impact us and hopefully it's not impacting him," Coach
Bruce Arena said Saturday. "Since he's been with us [in camp], there
has been no interference by outside people as far as I'm concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Arena, who won two MLS championships while coaching D.C. United,
said he had only one piece of advice for Mathis.</TE>
<TE>   "Play well in the World Cup," he said. "Score 10 goals and have
everyone in the world after you. That would be my advice."</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, who makes roughly the league maximum of $270,000 as an MLS
player and could earn at least double that simply by sitting on the
bench in Europe, is keeping things low key.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm letting my agent deal with it," he said. "My main focus right
now is the next few weeks, the next three games and preparing for
Korea. I don't need to worry about anything else and be side-tracked.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, it's not really going to matter unless I
play well, so I need to keep 100% focused on my training sessions,
the games we have coming up and what's ahead in a few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   After today's game, the U.S. plays Jamaica at Giants Stadium in
East Rutherford, N.J., on Thursday and the Netherlands at CMGI Field
in Foxboro, Mass., next Sunday. The team leaves for South Korea on
May 23.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Mathis' U.S. teammates, former UCLA players Joe-Max Moore
and Frankie Hejduk, both chose to leave MLS and play in Europe, Moore
with Everton in England and Hejduk with Bayer Leverkusen in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Both said Saturday that if given a chance to switch continents,
the 25-year-old from Conyers, Ga., should do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great idea for him," Moore said. "The Bundesliga
is one of the top three or four leagues in the world. And for him to
go over there and prove himself with one of the top clubs, I think
it's an opportunity he can't pass up.</TE>
<TE>   "For an American to be able to say he's played for Bayern Munich,
that doesn't happen very often. If it pans out, I wish him all the
best. He's got to take that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to play against the best, that's where you go," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a cautionary note here too.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bayer Leverkusen will play Real Madrid of Spain in
the European Champions Cup final. Hejduk is earning a good salary and
enjoying life in Germany but he will watch the game on television
from New Jersey because he has yet to make the German team's starting
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   And Bayern Munich is an even bigger club than Bayer Leverkusen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Today's Game</TE>
<TE>   What: World Cup warm-up game.</TE>
<TE>   Who: United States vs Uruguay.</TE>
<TE>   Where: RFK Stadium, Washington.</TE>
<TE>   When: 11 a.m., PDT.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Ch. 7, delayed at 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Update--This is the first of three games the U.S. will play in
eight days before leaving for Korea/Japan '02 and the only one
against another World Cup team. Coach Bruce Arena was in a rhetorical
mood Saturday when asked about their importance. "I don't know," he
said. "How important are they? If we win three of them do we go in as
the favorite to win the World Cup? It would be nice to get some
results. Is it critical to get three results here? No." Arena will be
without goalkeeper Kasey Keller and midfielders Claudio Reyna, Eddie
Lewis and John O'Brien, all of whom have European club commitments,
and defender Carlos Llamosa, who is recovering from a hamstring
injury that could threaten his World Cup place. "He missed 10 days of
training and we need to see if by the end of next week he can be
ready to play and contribute," Arena said. "If not, we might have to
make a change in our roster, but we hope he's going to be OK." If a
change is needed, former Galaxy defender Greg Vanney, now with Bastia
in France, is the probable replacement for Llamosa. Uruguay, which
holds a 2-1-2 edge over the U.S. in a series dating from 1924,
features such standouts as midfielder/forward Alvaro Recoba from
Inter Milan, defender Paolo Montero from Juventus and forward
Sebastian Abreu from Cruz Azul.</TE>

<HD>Mom's the Word</HD>
<DH>Hall of Famer Ann Meyers Drysdale carries on athletic
tradition, as broadcaster and as parent to a sports-minded brood</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If it's Wednesday, it must be soccer.</LD>
<LD>   If it's Saturday, it might be a mad scramble from one youngster's
soccer game in the morning to another's basketball game at noon, a
cousin's birthday party after that and a speaking engagement at
night.</LD>
<LD>   "Nice move, Drew!" Ann Meyers Drysdale shouts as her 9-year-old
daughter breaks free and sprints down the right sideline toward the
goal at a Huntington Beach park, slender legs churning, short hair
flying.</LD>
<TE>   It's soccer season for Darren too, and the 12-year-old is on the
verge of officiating his sister's game, then another official
arrives.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest boy, D.J.--short for Don Jr.--is 14 and has a keen mind
for baseball but is playing organized basketball for the first time
and might try football this fall, when he will be a freshman at
Huntington Beach High.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, at 5 feet 9, suddenly finds herself looking up at him.</TE>
<TE>   "He just passed me. He's 5-10," she says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They were the original Hall of Fame couple, Ann Meyers and Don
Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   She might be the only soccer mom in existence who actually earned
the Basketball Hall of Fame sweatshirt she wears, breaking ground as
the first woman to earn an athletic scholarship to UCLA and as a
member of the first U.S. women's Olympic team in 1976. Later, she
became the first to try out with an NBA team, the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Drysdale, enshrined at Cooperstown for his career as a dominating
Dodger pitcher alongside Sandy Koufax, was a broadcaster when he met
Meyers at a made-for-TV "Superstars" competition in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Their life together ended too soon, only seven years after they
were married, when Drysdale died of a heart attack at 56 in 1993
during a trip to Montreal with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The boys were 5 and 3, and Drew was a babe in arms, only 4 months
old.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are sprouting upward, an active and affectionate brood,
seemingly always dangling off their mom by an arm or a leg when
they're together.</TE>
<TE>   You get the idea when you phone the Drysdale house and get the
answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   "You've reached Annie, D.J., Darren and Drew, and we're out
playin' ball, but we'll get back to you."</TE>
<TE>   Drysdale's presence is everywhere in the family's Huntington Beach
home, from pictures with the children to one with Ronald Reagan to
baseball memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   "Don was great with the kids when they were little," said Meyers
Drysdale, 47. "It was different because he was older. His daughter
was grown from his first marriage. To have these little ones around,
he was excited.</TE>
<TE>   "I go and talk to the announcers or managers or people involved
with the game, they say that's all Don talked about, was the family.
His eyes would just light up when he saw them. So I miss that."</TE>
<TE>   They all miss him, but his grin beams into the house from behind
many frames.</TE>
<TE>   "They see their dad every day," Meyers Drysdale said.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell stories, but sometimes it's frustrating for Darren
because he can't remember. Drew was just born. She kind of feels left
out, like, 'How come I wasn't in the pictures?'"</TE>
<TE>   Ann's life is a busy swirl of the youngsters' activities and her
own full schedule, including her work as a television analyst that
takes her away for days at a time during the NCAA tournament in March
and the WNBA season during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Darren, you said you did your social studies?" she called up the
stairs at home the other day.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew, what do we need to do for this project?"</TE>
<TE>   Her family--a brother, Mark, lives a few minutes away--and a
longtime baby-sitter help make it work.</TE>
<TE>   "My family's been real supportive, and I have somebody who comes
in and stays when I'm gone and helps tremendously," she said. "I
really couldn't do those things without that.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to have home-cooked dinners once or twice a week. But it's
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Her hands are full, but she has seen it done before.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Pat, had 11 children, and finished raising them on her
own after she and the children's father divorced.</TE>
<TE>   "She's our role model, all of us, as parents," Meyers Drysdale
said. "She's our rock."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother sees how difficult it can be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty tough with her schedule, because of working," said
Pat Meyers, who lives in La Habra and sees the children often.</TE>
<TE>   "When she's home, she spends a lot of time with them, and she
makes sure they're on top of their schoolwork. She gets out and plays
ball with them too."</TE>
<TE>   Except for D.J.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't play me," Meyers Drysdale said. "Darren will ask me to
play one-on-one. D.J. could probably beat me, except I'd foul him. I
wouldn't let him score."</TE>
<TE>   Respected for her skill as an insightful and frank analyst on
men's and women's basketball, Meyers Drysdale works often but has
declined some major opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very grateful to the people in the business," she said. "I
know I could probably do a lot more games, probably double. But I
also know there's no way I could be the kind of parent I need to be."</TE>
<TE>   She works at being the kind of parent she and Drysdale talked
about being together.</TE>
<TE>   Not the least of that is finding the right place for sports in the
lives of children whose endeavors will be watched closely--though
probably not as closely as Jaden Agassi the first time he appears on
a tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   "Don and I talked about it," Meyers Drysdale said. "We didn't
expect them to become professional athletes. If they do, great.</TE>
<TE>   "But they've got to, No. 1, have fun doing it. And, No. 2, they've
got to work at it. And if they're going to work at their game,
they've got to work at their academics.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys have struggled a few times academically, and they've
missed some games; they've missed some practices. It's academics
first."</TE>
<TE>   The only other rule seems to be that it's too early for the sort
of specialization that turns the year into one endless basketball
season or one long baseball season.</TE>
<TE>   "In our day, you got on your bike and you were gone till
dinnertime," Meyers Drysdale said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you become focused on one sport, what's that about? Aren't
sports supposed to be fun?"</TE>
<TE>   For now, they seem to be.</TE>
<TE>   D.J. is long-armed and lanky, descended from late-bloomers on both
sides. But he seems destined to shoot past the other boys later, like
his father, who was 6-6, or his uncle, David Meyers, who is 6-9 and
played on two NCAA championship teams for John Wooden at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers Drysdale played for the Bruins' 1978 women's title team,
but she is close to Wooden too, and even calls him "Papa."</TE>
<TE>   "He's been very influential in my life, not just basketball," she
said. "He lost [his wife] Nellie and then I lost Don. He was very
supportive and right there. I feel like one of his grandkids, even
though I didn't play for him."</TE>
<TE>   It won't be long before people turn to look and see if another
generation might play in Westwood or even at Dodger Stadium, where
the boys became regulars in the dugout in the months after Drysdale
died, embraced by Tom Lasorda and Vin Scully, among others.</TE>
<TE>   For now, they just play.</TE>
<TE>   "D.J. hasn't settled on a sport. None of them have," his mother
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He really knows baseball. He plays every position. When he's
behind the plate, he knows where every ball should be. When he's at
shortstop, he remembers the count.</TE>
<TE>   "Darren played some Little League. It was too boring for him. He
wants to run.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew loves to run too. She's always trying to keep up with her
brothers. She played basketball too. Swimming, soccer. I think her
favorite thing is climbing trees."</TE>
<TE>   It's not only sports.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew's got singing. D.J.'s got acting," Meyers Drysdale said.
"And I send them to faith-formation school [at church]."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother knows how difficult it has been, but she sees past the
usual bumps and disciplinary issues of growing up and watches how
well her daughter and the children are doing after losing a husband
and father.</TE>
<TE>   "That first year is the toughest," Pat Meyers said. "A lot of it,
you have to go through by yourself. Having children brings it to
reality. You have to go on day to day and do the things that have to
be done. Somehow, you get through it."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, you keep going.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it's hard on the kids when she goes away," she said.
"I'm sure there's a little fear because their dad went away and
didn't come back."</TE>
<TE>   Their mom has always been there.</TE>
<TE>   "She's amazing in a lot of ways," Pat Meyers said. "She's very
thoughtful. At Christmastime, I don't know how many cards she sends
out.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'Annie, I think you could cut that in half.'"</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter doesn't listen.</TE>
<TE>   She can't have it all anymore, but she can give it all she has.</TE>

<LD>After 95 winless starts in the NASCAR Busch series, Bobby Hamilton
Jr. found the winning groove.</LD>
<LD>   Powering through the pack in the final 60 laps, Hamilton won the
Busch 200 at the New Hampshire International Speedway at Loudon,
N.H., on Saturday for his first victory.</LD>
<LD>   Hamilton, whose Ford is sponsored by the Marine Corps, jumped out
of his car and waved the Marine flag before doing a quick spin at the
finish line.</LD>
<TE>   Todd Bodine, who started third and was in contention most of the
way, finished second. Jack Sprague was third, and rookie pole-sitter
Shane Hmiel was fourth, his best finish.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton appeared to have his first victory in last week's
Hardee's 250 at Richmond, Va. But, leading with 11 laps left, he ran
out of gas and finished 25th.</TE>
<TE>   "Last week wasn't our week; today was our day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Hamilton, whose previous best finish was third last
month at Nashville, came from behind to win.</TE>
<TE>   He passed Bodine on Turn 3 of the 186th lap, and passed Hmiel at
nearly the same spot one lap later.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton cruised home, winning by 2.4 seconds. His average speed
over the 1.058-mile track was 110.340 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had a great car and when you get one like that, you can
go like that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Jason Keller, who started the race as the
series leader, and Winston Cup driver Jeff Burton were out of the
race early.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, looking for his third Busch victory of the season, had
engine problems and was gone after five laps. Keller sustained
front-end damage after getting hit from behind and pushed into
another car during a restart on the 20th lap. After going to the
garage area, he returned, but dropped out after 72 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Sprague took the points lead with 1,613.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rubens Barrichello won the pole position for the Austrian Grand
Prix and Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher had his worst qualifying
of the season, settling for third at Spielberg, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello turned a lap of 1 minute, 8.082 seconds on the
2.688-mile circuit to win his second pole of the year. Ralf
Schumacher qualified second at 1:08.364 in his BMW-Williams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Agoura Hills' Tim Huddleston made good use of a new engine,
winning the 50-lap Southern California Auto Club Late Model series
feature race in front of 5,868 at Irwindale Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Huddleston, with his second win of the season, pulled even with
series leader Todd Burns, who finished third behind Harbor City's
Mike Price, also driving with a new spec motor.</TE>
<TE>   In the 50-lap Ultra Wheels Super Truck feature race, Ron Peterson
held off Joe Herold and Dave Blankenship for the win. Travis
Thirkettle earned his first career win, in the Grand American
Modified series, by holding off points leader Roger Carufel Jr. in
the 35-lap feature race. Terry Limberopoulos took the 35-lap Modified
4's series feature race.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>The Hubris, the Too Proud, the Lakers</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ah, their day of reckoning, at last.</LD>
<LD>   If pride goeth before a fall, the Lakers were actually in trouble
a long time before this week, full of themselves to the bursting
point, even as they seemed to cheat the process with their new
Wake-Me-in-April routine.</LD>
<LD>   Hubris was piled atop arrogance. Laker players talked up a storm,
were never scared, never played with any sense of urgency. Nor, after
starting 16-1, did they scare anyone else, except with their
reputations.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago, their operative word was "dysfunctional," but now,
despite inner peace and a better team, in the absence of any
momentum, it became "vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Not that any of them was really concerned, of course. That was the
real problem from the get-go:</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal shows up at 375 pounds or so after toe surgery,
injures another toe and limps through a season he finally concedes
was "kind of dismal," on one of the increasingly infrequent days he
talks....</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson trots out more of his famous smack, wondering how
Portland fans can root for players so lacking in character, perhaps
forgetting his three years in Chicago, sticking up for the Role Model
from Hell, Dennis Rodman....</TE>
<TE>   Jackson notes after Game 1 of the current second-round series
against San Antonio, in which the Lakers trailed, 38-32, at halftime,
that he "never had a worse performance for a half out of a basketball
club in the playoffs." ...</TE>
<TE>   In Game 2, his basketball club trails by 21 before halftime,
presumably another new low.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising the Lakers, having overcome last season's
problems to win 39 of 41 (23-1 last spring, 16-1 in fall), were
sucked into this cult of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, seemingly destined to feud forever with
temporary truces, were now friends. Derek Fisher was a threat and
Devean George was a player. They had more size, depth and
athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   It added up to a huge margin for error ... which they then came
perilously close to using up.</TE>
<TE>   While falling for themselves, they lost respect for their rivals
but the Spurs weren't beneath contempt, after all, even if the Lakers
humiliated them last spring and won in San Antonio this season
without O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   This postseason wasn't another glory run, but the Lakers'
nightmare scenario. Without his old explosiveness, O'Neal was
averaging 24 points and 12 rebounds, fine, except in comparison to
the 30-15 his last two postseasons.</TE>
<TE>   If you wanted to hear him speak, you had to watch one of his
burger or candy commercials on TV (he doesn't eat all that stuff,
does he?). He seemed to hurt something else every game and, taking
him at his word about cutting himself trying to climb a wall a la
Spider-Man, even going to the movies wasn't safe.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a suggestion of how unconcerned his teammates were,
they barely bothered to throw the ball in to him, at least until the
other team got way ahead.</TE>
<TE>   In another tip-off things weren't right, Shaq, who always
complained when it happened before, never mentioned it.</TE>
<TE>   After Game 2, when he took seven rebounds, Jackson asked him to
turn it up and told the press about it, an old Phil tactic, further
noting their talk had been "heated."</TE>
<TE>   Later, of course, after O'Neal showed his displeasure, Jackson
downgraded it to "give and take," joking that the press corps--which
tapes his every word--had messed it up again.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving out the part where he tries to lay it off on us, this was
Jackson at his finest. This trick works, most famously when Scottie
Pippen took himself out of that 1994 playoff game and Jackson, who
could have covered it up, told the press without being asked, after
which a chastened Pippen bounced right back.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, your modern, highly-indulged megastar doesn't like to
be embarrassed ... or asked to do something ... or, often, asked
anything at all, and O'Neal's reaction last week ("Ask Phil, he knows
every ... thing") showed he wasn't laughing this one off.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's saving grace is knowing when to let his inner child out
to play Spider-Man and when he has to be a grown-up, as he was in his
redefining-moment Game 3, even as Bryant carried them in a glimpse of
the Laker future, and O'Neal and Jackson argued on the bench again.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, O'Neal has a lot going on, with the playoffs and the
summer releases. Now he has to fight off the Spurs the same week
"Attack of the Clones" opens.</TE>
<TE>   If Shaq can refrain from going after Phil with a light saber and
take it out on the Spurs, that's character, the only thing that will
save the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Forget China's Yao Ming being a reedy 7 feet 5, 236 pounds. The
NBA put out a sheet with those measurements, in error. The correct
weight is 296. In other words, the Shawn Bradley comparisons are off
again.... Just your average postseason in Philadelphia, except no one
has left (yet): Coach Larry Brown blasted Allen Iverson for missing a
practice during the 76ers' first-round loss to the Celtics and raised
the possibility of trading him ("You can't have a team, you can't do
anything the right way, if everybody is not responsible enough and
sensitive enough to their teammates to be on time, to practice, to
prepare"). Last week, Iverson gave an especially engaging/clueless
performance, even for him, railing during his own news conference:
"I'm supposed to be the franchise player and we're in here talking
about practice. Not a game--we're talking about practice. How silly
is that? ... Franchise players' daughters don't have to go to school
and hear, 'Is your daddy coming back? What's going on with your daddy
and Coach Brown?' I mean, she's 7 years old and that's what she's got
to deal with, you know what I'm saying?" The next day, Brown had
another news conference, joked that Iverson had used the word
"practice" more than he had actually practiced this season, but
announced he wouldn't be traded. Said Brown: "I told him, 'You can
tell your daughter not to worry about it, Daddy's going to be living
[in Philadelphia].'" Brown continues to insist he's staying too.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Michael Jordan has dropped out of sight in the
off-season, declining all interview requests, leaving a lot of
unanswered questions, such as: 1) Are you coming back? and 2) Should
we buy season tickets? Said titular General Manager Wes Unseld: "When
Michael makes his decision, everybody will hear from him, I'm sure."
In other words, "What do you want from me?" ... So much for the
return of the Bad Boys and the Celtic Mystique, or meet the Worse
Boys and the Celtic Mistake: In Friday's 66-64 thriller, the Celtics
(who won, for the record) and Pistons broke the post-shot clock
record for lowest-scoring playoff game--by 12 points. Wrote the
Boston Globe's Michael Holley: "This was one of those times when you
didn't want to share your favorite team with the rest of America. You
hoped that everyone outside of New England and Michigan had other
Friday night plans." Meanwhile, Antoine Walker called it a "great
game" but added, "We know the shots won't always be there so we may
have to win like this." Speaking for the rest of the country, better
make other plans this morning because these two beasts are going
again.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointed Pacer Reggie Miller noted the Nets' "young guys
stepped up and our young guys didn't. Our young guys didn't respond
when they had to. That's discouraging to me because I thought we had
the best young guys in the league." This looks like it was meant for
Jermaine O'Neal, guarded by Kenyon Martin, who outscored him, 82-56,
in Games 2-5. Meanwhile, Pacer President Donnie Walsh served notice
Isiah Thomas can't cite his players' youth any more. "From my
standpoint, the young stuff is over," Walsh said. "That's why it was
important to get in the playoffs. Now every player on our team has an
idea what this is really all about." Insiders say hiring Thomas was
the owners' idea, not Walsh's, and Thomas' honeymoon is over....
Oops: Chris Childs, believing the Raptors trailed by four points with
4.9 seconds left in their Game 5 loss in Detroit, fired up a
two-point shot, missed and bristled when asked about it. "It was
85-81. Next question," Childs snapped. Actually, it was 85-82, and
the next question is where Childs, a free agent, will be next
season.... Line of the week from TNT's studio show. Ernie Johnson:
"Here's NBC's Saturday schedule." Voice in the background, either
Kenny Smith or Charles Barkley: "Like we care."</TE>

<HD>Kidd's Playing Status Uncertain</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Jason Kidd was the last one off the Nets' team bus Saturday, dark
sunglasses covering his swollen eye. When he took them off, he looked
more like a boxer after losing a title fight than New Jersey's star
guard.</LD>
<LD>   His right eyelid was swollen and bruised, the clear bandage over
his eyebrow doing little to cover the dozen or so stitches underneath
it. A second purplish bruise ran diagonally underneath his eye.</LD>
<LD>   As bad as the wounds looked from Thursday night's bloody,
head-to-head collision with Charlotte Hornet guard David Wesley, the
Nets insisted Kidd's eye was improving and were hopeful he would play
today in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   "I can see everything, the eye is opening and has gotten better
each day. My vision hasn't been blurred," said Kidd, a towel draped
over his head after some light shooting drills.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play, but if my eye shuts, there's no way I can play.
The big thing is to see how I feel in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte center Elden Campbell missed practice Saturday with a
virus, and the Hornets are hoping it is just a 24-hour bug.</TE>

<LD>Andre Agassi will attempt to erase the memory of a defeat 13 years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-time Grand Slam champion defeated Jiri Novak, 7-5, 6-4,
Saturday at Rome to advance to today's final of the Italian Open for
the first time since a five-set loss to Alberto Mancini in 1989.
Agassi will play Germany's Tommy Haas, a 6-1, 7-5 winner over Andy
Roddick. The tournament has never had two Americans in the final
since it started in 1930.</LD>
<LD>   Agassi used sharp groundstrokes and strong return of serve to
break the 14th-seeded Czech player once in each set in front of a
sellout crowd on center court.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity for me," Agassi said. "To get through
all the matches so far has been great."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, 32, produced his best previous result at Rome in 1989,
losing in five sets to Mancini after squandering a match point.</TE>
<TE>   "That was 13 years ago, so I've managed to forget a bit," Agassi
said.</TE>

<HD>Shinjo Throws Off Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tsuyoshi Shinjo's sensational throw was the talk of the San Francisco
Giants' clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Shinjo threw out the potential tying run at the plate in the
eighth inning after Jeff Kent's run-scoring double gave the Giants
the lead in the top half of the inning, and San Francisco defeated
the Montreal Expos, 3-2, Saturday night before the largest Olympic
Stadium crowd since opening day.</LD>
<LD>   "That's one of the best plays of the year so far," said catcher
Benito Santiago, who caught the center fielder's one-hop throw from
right and tagged out Troy O'Leary to protect the Giants' one-run
lead.</LD>
<TE>   With 29,778 on hand for a discount tickets and hot dogs promotion,
San Francisco overcame a 2-1 deficit on Rich Aurilia's run-scoring
single against Britt Reames (0-1) and Kent's double.</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary singled with one out in the bottom half and tried to score
on Fernando Tatis' double off the right-field wall. The ball bounced
away from Marvin Benard, but Shinjo, backing up Benard, retrieved the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't say anything to Marvin. He told me, 'Home! Home! Home!'"
Shinjo said.</TE>
<TE>   From deep right field, Shinjo threw a one-hopper to Santiago, who
tagged out O'Leary as he slid short of the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "My mouth was just open," Benard said. "You expect a guy to throw
the ball, but to the cutoff man. You don't expect him to just launch
it all the way like that, so you've just got to sit there and say,
'Where'd it go?'"</TE>
<TE>   Shinjo's play drew praise from Expo Manager--and Hall of Fame
outfielder--Frank Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "That's exactly what you're supposed to do," Robinson said. "He
did it, though, that's the thing. A lot of outfielders will stand and
be spectators in that situation, but he did what you practice doing.
The center fielder is supposed to break as soon as the ball is hit
and he did that tonight and made an outstanding throw."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco won its 10th in 12 games. Robb Nen pitched the ninth
for his 10th save in 11 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos' biggest crowd since 34,351 attended their
season-opening 7-6 victory over Florida didn't get to see Barry Bonds
play. Bonds was rested for the second of San Francisco's three games
on the stadium's artificial surface.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, San Diego 1--Slumping Javy Lopez hit a grand slam and a
double at Atlanta to drive in a career-high five runs.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Jason Marquis (2-2), activated from the disabled list
before the game, hit a home run.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis (2-2) sat out nearly a month because of a sore pitching
shoulder. He labored through five innings, walking three and throwing
101 pitches. He gave up one run and three hits.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez ended a three-for-36 slump in helping the Braves win their
third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Houston 2--Josh Fogg (5-1) gave up four hits in
seven innings at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Fogg withstood Lance Berkman's 14th homer and a game-long steady
rain. He struck out and walked none.</TE>
<TE>   Houston has lost a season-high five in a row and has been held to
four runs in its last three games.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Colorado 3--Joe McEwing hit a three-run homer in the
sixth inning against Mike Hampton at New York and the Mets ended a
six-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton (1-5)--booed much of the afternoon--couldn't hold a 3-1
lead. He is 6-16 since last year's All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, St. Louis 1--Juan Encarnacion hit a two-run single
and Corky Miller had a two-run double in the Reds' four-run third
inning against Darryl Kile (1-3) at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Miller later hit a home run and finished with three runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee at Chicago--The game was postponed because of rain and
will be made up as part of a doubleheader Sept. 2.</TE>

<HD>Saving Arizona Can Be Trying</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Kim blows save opportunity for the Diamondbacks,
rekindling memories of World Series, but hangs on to defeat Phillies,
6-5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Byung-Hyun Kim didn't have to wait five months to redeem himself.</LD>
<LD>   Junior Spivey hit a run-scoring double with two out in the 10th
inning, and the Arizona Diamondbacks overcame Kim's first blown save
this season to beat Philadelphia, 6-5, Saturday night at Philadelphia
and end the Phillies' seven-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   The Phillies trailed, 5-0, in the fourth inning, but scored four
runs against Randy Johnson and tied the score, 5-5, on Tomas Perez's
one-out homer against Kim in the ninth.</LD>
<TE>   Kim (1-0) had converted his 10 save opportunities this season
after blowing Games 4 and 5 in the World Series against the New York
Yankees last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We had every intention of taking him out after the ninth because
he had thrown 26 pitches, but after we scored the run, he insisted he
was fine to throw one more," Diamondback Manager Bob Brenly said.
"Pitchers aren't robots. They make mistakes. BK is no different."</TE>
<TE>   Kim pitched a perfect 10th for the victory. He gave up two hits in
three innings, and struck out the side on nine pitches in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "I got hit, just like any other day," Kim said through an
interpreter. "I felt confident I could pitch one more inning."</TE>
<TE>   In last season's World Series, Kim gave up a game-tying home run
to Tino Martinez in the ninth inning of Game 4, and a game-winning
homer to Derek Jeter moments later. He gave up a game-tying, two-out
ninth inning shot to Scott Brosius in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Kim didn't pitch again in the series, but Arizona won in seven
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope there are no flashbacks. I don't think they'll be any
lasting effects," Brenly said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson gave up four runs, eight hits--two homers--and struck out
eight in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to give Randy Johnson a 5-0 lead," Phillie Manager
Larry Bowa said. "He's a dominant pitcher. But we battled hard."</TE>

<LD>Another race, another record for Deena Drossin, the beacon of hope
for U.S. women's distance running.</LD>
<LD>   Drossin, who grew up in Agoura Hills and lives in Mammoth Lakes,
became the first U.S. woman to break 31 minutes in the 10,000-meter
run when she was clocked in 30 minutes, 50.32 seconds at The Cardinal
Invitational at Stanford on May 3. She demolished the previous U.S.
record of 31:19.89, set by Lynn Jennings in a bronze-medal
performance at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Add that to the U.S. 15K road record Drossin set in March, her
silver medal at the world cross-country championships in Ireland that
month and the world 5K road record she set at Carlsbad in April, and
it has already been an impressive year.</LD>
<TE>   And she's merely getting started.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a surprise, because I haven't really changed much in
terms of training," said Drossin, who won the U.S. women's marathon
championship last year in New York, with a fastest U.S.-debut time of
2 hours 26 minutes 58 seconds. "The only difference is I'm doing
plyometrics and a weight routine. I think they've helped with my form
and my economy of motion."</TE>
<TE>   Drossin was going for a U.S. record May 3, but she didn't expect
to break it so dramatically. Yoko Shibui of Japan set a Japanese
record and a U.S. all-comers record by winning the race in 30 minutes
48.89 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Conditions were just perfect that night," said Drossin, a member
of the Team USA California distance running program. "The last three
laps, it got really hard, but I was so excited about where I was in
the race, it boosted my adrenaline. And [Shibui] took the pressure
off."</TE>
<TE>   Drossin will next run at the Bolder Boulder International Team
Challenge on May 27 in Colorado. She will team with Jen Rhines, who
set a personal best time of 31:41.16 in finishing third to Drossin at
the Cardinal Invitational, and Colleen De Reuck, who set a U.S.
women's 12K road record of 38:53 last week in Spokane, Wash. The
previous 12K road record, 39:14, was set by Jennings in the 1993 Bay
to Breakers race. Drossin and Rhines are also scheduled to compete in
the Chicago Marathon Oct. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, though, Drossin plans to compete in the 5K at the
U.S. championships in June at Palo Alto and also run in Europe. She
said she has no other records in her sights, but nothing seems
impossible given the way she has been running.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to bring my 5K time down," she said. "I've run under 14:51
and I want to go under 14:50. At Chicago, I'd like to run fast, but I
haven't really set a time goal."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA alumnus Meb Keflezighi also had a noteworthy night at the
Cardinal Invitational, recording the second-fastest 10K time by a
U.S. athlete, 27:20.15. The only faster time was the 27:13.98 he ran
at Stanford a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Keflezighi will run the 5K at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene,
Ore., on May 26.</TE>
<TE>   In the Swim</TE>
<TE>   Backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg, slowed late last year by shoulder
surgery and this year by a lung infection, said he's looking forward
to the "Duel in the Pool," the U.S.-Australia swim meet to be held
next April in Indianapolis. But the Sydney triple-gold medalist, a
USC alumnus, is looking even beyond that to the 2004 U.S. Olympic
trials in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two things I believe will make [the trials] really
exciting," said Krayzelburg, who emigrated from Ukraine with his
family as a youngster. "The first is it's in California, and there's
tremendous interest in swimming here. There should be a huge turnout.
Second is the unique format of the trials. They're going to use two
portable pools right near the beach, right where the Grand Prix [auto
race] is."</TE>
<TE>   Krayzelburg, 26, plans to compete in the trials and 2004 Athens
Games, shoulder willing.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is to stay healthy," he said, "and if I stay
healthy, I think I have as good a shot as 2000."</TE>
<TE>   Gym Sweep</TE>
<TE>   U.S. gymnasts won the men's, women's and rhythmic team
competitions at the Senior Pacific Alliance Championships at
Vancouver, Canada, May 3-5.</TE>
<TE>   Among the men, Paul Hamm and Brett McClure finished 1-2 in the
all-around, and Hamm also won the vault and high bar. The U.S. men
had 164.575 points, well ahead of Japan (159.225) and Australia
(157.825). The U.S. junior men's team also won its competition.</TE>
<TE>   Tasha Schwikert, Terin Humphrey and Kristal Uzelac won the top
three places in the women's all-around and helped the U.S. women win
the team competition with 111.223 points. Australia was second at
107.099 and Japan was third with 104.723. Schwikert also won gold on
balance beam and silver on the uneven bars and floor exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. junior men's and women's teams also won team titles.</TE>
<TE>   No Artistic Scores Here</TE>
<TE>   Having left Olympic-eligible skating for the pro ranks, pair
skater David Pelletier registered to play forward in a recreational
hockey league in Edmonton, where he and partner Jamie Sale train.</TE>
<TE>   Pelletier doesn't miss the regimented world of elite figure
skating.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I learned to walk, I've been skating, always planning six
months ahead, always getting ready for competitions," he told
Canadian reporters. "I'm happy that's behind me. I left the eligible
world without regrets."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier, who got duplicate gold medals after the Salt
Lake City Olympic judging scandal came to light, still marvel at
their recent fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere we go, we're recognized, even in New York," Pelletier
said. "It's as if the whole world stopped for the Olympics. It's
amazing the impact we've had on people."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Terry Schroeder, chosen for four U.S. Olympic water polo teams,
was honored Saturday at the International Swimming Hall of Fame in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Schroeder, who coaches Pepperdine's men's team,
was the model for the male torso outside the entrance to the
Coliseum. Also to be honored are swimmers Jill Sterkel and Summer
Sanders.... Sydney Olympian Joanna Zeiger of Baltimore won the St.
Croix Half Ironman triathlon last weekend with a time of 4 hours 43
minutes, 2 seconds. The top U.S. male finisher was Tony DeBoom, who
was sixth in 4:18:31.... Amber Neben of Irvine won her first major
cycling road race last week at the Gracia Cez, a five-day, 263-mile
race in the Czech Republic.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Which shooter do the Spurs want to take it?</LD>
<LD>   To a man--from the roster to the staff--they would say Steve
Smith. The perfect stroke, the perfect mind-set.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago they might have said the same about Terry Porter. So
note the history and the impact and the reality. Just as Porter
missed a year ago, Smith missed Friday. Just as Kobe Bryant hung in
the air and threw in tough looks, Smith stood flat footed and missed
easy ones.</LD>
<TE>   Who do the Spurs want to take it?</TE>
<TE>   Today they wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Today they also wonder if the answer should be Tony Parker. Back
in the Seattle series, when Parker was doing the unforeseeable to
Gary Payton, he talked about the unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   David Robinson out, Tim Duncan out. What could the Spurs do in
Game 4?</TE>
<TE>   Parker knew. He would have to be Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Parker knew about something that happened before he was alive,
when Magic Johnson filled in as a rookie for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Magic jumped center, scored 42 points and won a title for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Couldn't this rookie do the same as that rookie?</TE>
<TE>   He didn't that day. But as he sped past Payton in that series,
winning a matchup the Spurs never dreamed of winning, merely Parker's
idea summed up what could happen. No rookie point guard since Magic
has won a title.</TE>
<TE>   He showed signs of that again Friday, throwing in 20 points before
halftime. And midway through the fourth period, when Parker came off
the bench for the final surge, he let go a three as if it was only
natural for a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   He missed. Bryant--when he was a teenager and airballing against
Utah in his first playoffs--had the same belief.</TE>
<TE>   So the nerve is there, and Bryant showed what happens when it gets
some seasoning. He responded Friday as Michael Jordan would have,
taking back the series with a glare.</TE>
<TE>   The traveling move that ended Game 2? Kobe took 31 shots to make
sure he erased it.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs have seen it before. Last year his three-pointer near
the end of Game 2 sent the sweep on its way.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Bryant turned and lifted over Bruce Bowen with about three
minutes left, giving the Lakers a six-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Smith didn't get nearly as many chances. In a shooting line of two
for eight, a late hit was meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   But it was when and how. The Spurs ran plays coming out of
timeouts for him, in big moments, and never did he have to hang as
Kobe did. Smith was planted, set, in automatic mode.</TE>
<TE>   Porter had similar looks, and more of them, against the Lakers in
that critical Game 2 Kobe won a year ago. The Spurs loved their
chance as Porter went up.</TE>
<TE>   Porter was then what Smith is now. On many nights this year, Danny
Ferry has been, too.</TE>
<TE>   But with every jumper that Smith--or Ferry or Bowen or
anyone--missed Friday, the Lakers leaned toward Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry is smart enough by himself. But when other Lakers
edge back?</TE>
<TE>   Jumpers help.</TE>
<TE>   Now, which shooter do the Spurs want to take them?</TE>
<GT></GT>

Parker, as Derek Fisher and Rick Fox did in double teaming him

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Years pass, seasons fade, and a funny thing happens to the precocious
guard with the oversized headband.</LD>
<LD>   Derek Fisher looks up, and he's guarding some kid eight years
younger.</LD>
<LD>   He looks up, and the kid is past him.</LD>
<TE>   He looks up, and he's old.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't that something?" said Fisher, 27. "I was thinking the other
night, all those times I was the young guy battling John Stockton ...
and now, in this series, it's like, I'm Stockton."</TE>
<TE>   And Tony Parker, 19, is his teenage nightmare: sassy, stubborn and
wanting to run all night.</TE>
<TE>   At times during the first three games of the Western Conference
semifinals between Fisher's Lakers and Parker's San Antonio Spurs,
the kid has driven the old guy batty.</TE>
<TE>   Speeding around him after curfew. Trampling through his prize
defense. Turning him into the equivalent of the neighborhood grump.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the third quarter Friday, a well-aimed Parker elbow caused
Fisher to push the kid away and shout the one thing he never thought
he would be shouting at anybody.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch yourself, young fella!" Fisher scolded.</TE>
<TE>   Young fella?</TE>
<TE>   "It's crazy, ain't it?" Kobe Bryant observed. "The old dog getting
chased around by that young pup."</TE>
<TE>   You want to know what's even crazier?</TE>
<TE>   Despite the appearance of being collared, the old dog is winning.</TE>
<TE>   Parker is averaging 13 points, Fisher is averaging 11.</TE>
<TE>   Parker is shooting 43%, Fisher is shooting 31%.</TE>
<TE>   Parker is averaging six assists, Fisher is averaging two.</TE>
<TE>   "But the only number I care about is the only number that
matters," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Meaning this: The Lakers have won two games, and the Spurs have
won one.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, we have to get down and dirty," Bryant said. "And
nobody on this team is more down and dirty than Fisher."</TE>
<TE>   It is a quality that has served Fisher well here, and will
continue to be a necessity if the Lakers are to continue playing.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike last year, Fisher has no Tyronn Lue for defensive backup,
no Ron Harper for composure, no place to run, and no excuses to run
there.</TE>
<TE>   Also unlike last year, Fisher will face a great point guard before
the finals, with Sacramento's Mike Bibby possibly waiting for him in
the next round.</TE>
<TE>   It has been said that on a team with the game's two greatest
stars, no one person is an island.</TE>
<TE>   But for the next couple of weeks, perhaps, Fisher will have to
fight his way off one, beginning with his current battle against
perhaps the league's most unique player.</TE>
<TE>   Parker is the only guy in the NBA who runs like a sprinter ... yet
talks like a hockey player.</TE>
<TE>   With his thick French accent, the former Parisian sounds
completely out of place amid the game's urban vibes.</TE>
<TE>   There was no mistaking, however, his half-set, half-jump shot--a
hop shot?--that accounted for 20 first-half points Friday. This
happened while Fisher was still searching for his first two-point
basket of the series.</TE>
<TE>   One guy was growing up fast. The other guy was aging like fine
milk.</TE>
<TE>   "I took it very personally," Fisher said. "You never want to be
the guy whose man is beating him."</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, realizing that Parker was getting open looks because
of pick-and-rolls, the Laker coaching staff adjusted their defense.</TE>
<TE>   While Derek Fisher adjusted his neck.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Derek is, he's strong, and he'll try to body the
other point guards," said Spur Steve Smith. "And Tony just being 19,
he doesn't have a body yet."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher busted through picks and hounded Parker into missing all
three of his shots in a third quarter that turned on the old dog's
bite.</TE>
<TE>   With 1:26 remaining in the quarter, and the Lakers trailing by
one, Fisher dribbled the length of the floor for a layup that put
them ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, at the other end of the floor, he blocked Parker's
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Then Parker threw the elbow, and Fisher threw him off, and a
double technical foul was called.</TE>
<TE>   Said Parker with a grimace: "I don't back down from anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fisher with a grin: "I just told him, 'Don't think you can do
that to me.'"</TE>
<TE>   Parker then missed a layup, Fisher connected on a three-pointer,
and the Lakers carried a three-point lead into a fourth quarter that
they dominated.</TE>
<TE>   "Derek is going to keep coming at you," Bryant said. "Doesn't
matter what you throw at him, he'll keep coming."</TE>
<TE>   From one old guy to another.</TE>

<HD>Fontana District Ordered to Pay Loyola Plaintiffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joel Hood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than two weeks of deliberation, an independent arbitrator
has ruled the Fontana Unified School District must pay six Loyola
High plaintiffs a combined $32,500 for injuries they sustained in a
1999 postgame fight between the Fontana and Loyola football teams.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, handed down by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Troy
Roe, ends a 20-month battle to determine responsibility for the
brawl, which resulted in numerous injuries to five Loyola coaches and
the school's athletic trainer.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath, 13 Fontana players were suspended, two were
expelled and one, running back Anthony Robinson, faced misdemeanor
battery charges. He pleaded no contest in February 2000 and was
placed on probation for three years. The incident also contributed to
the resignation of Fontana's coach, Bob Stangel Jr.</LD>
<TE>   The case had been scheduled to go to trial Feb. 4, but the school
district decided to waive the proceedings and admitted legal
liability. The lawsuit alleged that Fontana coaches were negligent in
controlling their players after the Steelers' 21-7 loss in the first
round of the 1999 Southern Section Division I playoffs, a game played
at Pierce College in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs sought $49,500 in damages, but Fontana Unified's
top offer was $18,000. District officials even rejected an earlier
arbitrator's ruling to award the Loyola coaches $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides finally agreed to abide by the second arbitrator's
ruling.</TE>

<HD>Cavic Continues to Swim Through Record Barriers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Cavic didn't accomplish all that he desired Saturday at the
Southern Section Division III boys' swimming finals, but he still
performed at a high level.</LD>
<LD>   Cavic, a senior at Tustin High, lowered his day-old national high
school record in the 50-yard freestyle and just missed national
records in the 100 butterfly and 100 backstroke.</LD>
<LD>   Cavic broke his national record on the opening leg of the 200
freestyle relay, touching the wall in 19.69 seconds. Cavic was
looking forward to lowering his time in the event after clocking a
19.77 split Friday at the preliminaries, breaking a five-year-old
national record (19.91).</LD>
<TE>   Cavic also talked of becoming the first swimmer to break 47
seconds in the 100 butterfly in a high school meet, but he finished
in 47.13, missing the national record by .03.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic surpassed all expectations by winning the backstroke in
47.55, just .05 off the eight-year-old national record. Cavic was
equally thrilled that he swam faster in the event than Aaron Peirsol
of Newport Harbor did on Friday night in the Division I finals.
Peirsol is the long and short course world-record holder in the
200-meter backstroke.</TE>
<TE>   "The 100 back blew me away," Cavic said. "I only train in the
backstroke about 100 yards a day. I don't deserve to go 47.5."</TE>
<TE>   Cavic wasn't finished. He broke his fourth division record of the
day in the 100 freestyle by swimming a 44.11 opening leg on the 400
freestyle relay. With his butterfly and backstroke records still
standing from when he competed in Division II as a sophomore, Cavic
ended his high school career with six divisional records.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic's performances helped the Tillers finish in 10th in the team
standings. Murrieta Valley won the title with 231 points, followed by
San Luis Obispo (207) and Yucaipa (160).</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Mayfield won the girls' title with 238 points, edging
defending champion Whittier La Serna (226), Camarillo (212) and
Yucaipa (208).</TE>
<TE>   Mayfield freshman Alexandra Wiley won the 200 individual medley
(2:05.87) and 100 freestyle (52.66) and teammate Joy Tanizaki, a
junior, won the 100 breaststroke (1:06.69).</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Hentzen won the 200 freestyle (1:51.41), the 500 freestyle
(4:50.01) and anchored La Serna's winning 200 (1:40.40) and 400
freestyle relays (3:35.96). La Serna's victory in the 400 free relay
produced the lone division record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Poly won the girls' Division II title behind Jeri Moss,
who broke a year-old divisional record in the 100 backstroke (55.18).
Moss also anchored the 400 freestyle relay team to victory in the
final event in 3:33.21, which made up a 10.5-point deficit against
North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Poly scored 221 points, defending champion Crescenta
Valley had 201.5 and Harvard-Westlake, which didn't qualify a 400
freestyle relay team, finished third 191.5.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard-Westlake set a division record in the opening event, the
200 medley relay (1:49.51), and Glendora sophomore Courtney Eads
broke a 21-year-old division record in the 100 butterfly (55.47).</TE>
<TE>   Mike Linn of Newhall Hart won the 50 (20.85) and 100 freestyles
(45.59) and anchored the winning 200 freestyle relay (1:27.89) to
lead the Indians to the team title. Hart scored 237 points, followed
by Riverside Poly (176) and Fullerton Troy (175).</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In track and field:</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section Division III preliminaries--Senior Chelsea
Johnson of Atascadero set a divisional record of 12 feet 8 inches in
the girls' pole vault in the meet at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In badminton:</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section finals--Villa Park's Eric Go won the boys'
singles title with a 15-6, 15-1 victory over Long Beach Poly's
Nicholas Jinadasa and Keppel's Jun Hu claimed the girls' singles
title with an 11-1, 11-0 victory over Amanda Lum of Palos Verdes
Peninsula at Orange County Badminton Club in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Winning doubles titles were Villa Park's Mike Chansawangpuvana and
Brendan Taft in boys' play and Villa Park's Eva Lee and Connie Hwang
in girls' play.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Advance the Cause on Blues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>When nothing less than a Stanley Cup will do, the Detroit Red Wings
figure there's no use celebrating along the way.</LD>
<LD>   Brendan Shanahan had two goals and two assists and Dominik Hasek
made 16 saves for his third shutout of the playoffs as the Red Wings
eliminated St. Louis with a 4-0 victory Saturday in Game 5 of their
second-round series.</LD>
<LD>   After the game, the Red Wings were businesslike--not the least bit
giddy--despite reaching the Western Conference finals for the first
time since 1998, the year they won their second consecutive Stanley
Cup.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we've got pretty good perspective," Shanahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit will face the winner of the Colorado-San Jose series. The
Red Wings have won eight of their last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings had little interest in dragging out the series with
a Game 6 in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to win badly to not have to go back and wear out a lot
of guys," Coach Scotty Bowman said. "And maybe not even win."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit eliminated St. Louis from the playoffs for the fourth time
since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Jiri Fischer and Tomas Holmstrom scored second-period goals and
Shanahan sealed the victory with a goal with 3:03 left and then an
empty-netter with 41.5 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   A difficult challenge was made even tougher for the Blues when
they lost defenseman Chris Pronger, their captain, to a season-ending
knee injury in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the same team," Hasek said. "They really missed him."</TE>
<TE>   That fact didn't make the loss any easier to take for the Blues.</TE>
<TE>   "We were confident in this room; we always thought we'd win this
series," St. Louis' Jamal Mayers said. "To lose like this is
extremely disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit broke the scoreless tie at 4:42 of the second on Fischer's
wrist shot from above the left circle. The Red Wings went ahead 2-0
midway through the period when Holmstrom redirected Shanahan's shot.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek's shutout was the ninth of his career.</TE>

<DH>NHL playoffs: San Jose wipes out deficit to beat Colorado,
5-3, and move within a win of first conference final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Despite trailing the best closing team in the NHL, the San Jose
Sharks didn't change a thing in the third period.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Ricci and Teemu Selanne scored within a three-minute span of
the third period and San Jose rallied to beat Colorado, 5-3, on
Saturday to take a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference semifinal
series.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose is seeking its first appearance in a conference final.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't abandon our game plan in the third period," Selanne
said. "We have been awesome in the third period the whole season. We
knew we had a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado was 34-0-1 during the regular season when leading after
two periods, but twice has lost leads against the Sharks. San Jose
also scored three goals in the third period to beat the defending
Stanley Cup champions, 6-4, in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we sat on the lead in the third period," Colorado's Joe
Sakic said. "We cannot be giving up a lead like that in the third
period."</TE>
<TE>   San Jose had lost six consecutive Game 5s before winning two this
season. The Sharks closed out their first-round series against
Phoenix with a 4-1 victory in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, the team that wins Game 5 has gone on to win the
series 17 of 21 times. Game 6 of the best-of-seven series is Monday
night at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to play with a lot of will and desire in the next
game," Colorado's Adam Foote said. "We've made it tough on ourselves.
We have our backs against the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado led, 3-2, after the two teams combined for five goals in
a 5:58 span of the second period, but Ricci tied it 5:59 into the
third with his fourth goal of the playoffs. Colorado goalie Patrick
Roy stopped a redirected shot by Scott Thornton, but the puck bounced
to Ricci, who punched in the rebound from just outside the crease.</TE>
<TE>   Selanne made it 4-3 at 9:04, beating Roy stickside from the top of
the right circle. It was Selanne's fifth goal of the series after he
went five games without one against Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Owen Nolan added an empty-net goal with 2.5 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been through a lot," Ricci said. "Third periods don't bug
us."</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's Marco Sturm started the second-period scoring binge
with 7:53 left on a one-timer from the left post. Peter Forsberg tied
it 1:33 later, whirling around in the slot to beat Evgeni Nabokov
between the pads.</TE>

<LD>I just survived what could have been one of the most harrowing
experiences of my life--breakfast with a pair of Raider fans.</LD>
<LD>   They called, and wanted to know if we could meet somewhere.</LD>
<LD>   I demanded a public place, weapons on the table and no one going
to the bathroom like in the Godfather, finding a gun in the towel
dispenser and leaving me face-down in my Denver omelet.</LD>
<TE>   These two guys are well-known Raider fans, one a Costa Mesa sales
rep and the other a Long Beach accountant, and get this: They
admitted Saturday they struck some deal with the Raiders in 1998 to
pepper L.A. politicians and media with letters, faxes and e-mails
suggesting the team will return one day.</TE>
<TE>   They won't say what their arrangement with the Raiders is or how
much they're being paid: "Obviously nothing is for free," one of them
said.</TE>
<TE>   They said they weren't the only ones hired. They said the Raiders
will deny knowledge of their existence if called. I called the
Raiders, and the Raiders deny their own existence.</TE>
<TE>   For the past few years the letter writers have been given seats in
a luxury suite in Oakland to watch the Raiders, an indication the
team thinks the pair has done a good job pestering the L.A. media and
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Baltzer and Mike Bernstein sent the first letter to me on
Dec. 1, 1998, and just about every week or so since, the propaganda
barrage has continued. Let me tell you, that's a lot of letters,
faxes and e-mails I've thrown away.</TE>
<TE>   You've probably seen their names under letters from readers in The
Times, the Orange County Register, the Los Angeles Daily News and the
Long Beach Press-Telegram. Mike &amp; Mike have had their names in the
paper more than Plaschke &amp; Pucin, and I'm not saying that's a bad
thing, just an observation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW FOR all we know Mike Baltzer and Mike Bernstein are pen names
for Al Davis. Bernstein, however, swears it's Baltzer who writes the
Raider blabber to a mailing list of more than 50 politicians and
media after the two have compared notes.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein said the whole thing got started because he knew someone
who goes way back with Davis. He said he spotted several Raider
billboards around the L.A. area, which he took as a signal from the
football gods the team was coming back to town. The old pal relayed
this to Davis, who obviously took notice, because all along he
thought he was one of the football gods.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders told Bernstein he could help and they'd show their
appreciation. He had met Baltzer, another Raider fan, at a local gym
years earlier, so Mike &amp; Mike came together to litter L.A. on the
Raiders' behalf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I was worried I would lose my appetite sitting across from two
guys wearing nose rings, fearful they might catch me staring at their
spiked hair or cause a disturbance in the restaurant with all the
chains they'd be packing.</TE>
<TE>   I've had experience eating with the wife's three brothers, and all
the embarrassment that comes with sitting with three messy chow
hounds in public. But these two guys are on Davis' payroll, so it
would have been nice if I could've convinced Dwyre, or someone else
with no future, to come along as a food tester.</TE>
<TE>   The first Mike I met, however, looked like he was ready to receive
his First Communion, his hair combed just like his mother might have
done it for him. A very friendly, sane man who doesn't look or act
anything like a Raider fan. He just had a stack of mail he's sent to
politicians and media sitting a foot high in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   The second Mike didn't take any offense at all when I told him
he'd have to eat without a knife. He ordered a waffle with
strawberries, gummed his food without complaint, and is a very nice
father of three daughters who attempts to brainwash them only on game
day, when they're required to wear Raider T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   These were the two Raider monsters who have been harassing me for
more than three years, and I swear if I had yelled "boo," they would
have reacted just like the Raiders in postseason play, and curled up
in a ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We're Raider fans and we just want to put the facts out there, a
little spin with some humor and just make sure the people in the
media keep their eyes open," Bernstein said. "It's 50-50 now, but we
still believe the Raiders are coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Recent stories that have the Anschutz Empire making nice with the
Chargers don't concern Mike &amp; Mike. They believe the Raiders will be
here before the Chargers, and wrote to say so. They were writing to
everyone three years ago saying the expansion team would go to
Houston, and they were right. They were writing to everyone a year
ago saying the Raiders would win their L.A. court case, and they were
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   And because there's no end to what a blubbering Davis has to say,
they will continue to write. Only now, I'll really know who is
writing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I STOPPED by Edison Field Saturday night to congratulate Tim
Salmon on baseball's single biggest achievement in the past 50 years:
Salmon getting four hits in the same game. He reacted, though, as if
I had been sent there to strike him out, and then promptly whiffed on
my first three questions. I hope it doesn't send him into another
slump.</TE>

<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an office memo:</TE>
<TE>   "NFL writer Sam Farmer is the proud father of Claire Elizabeth
Rose Farmer, who was born at 4:34 p.m. Wednesday. Mother and child
are doing well."</TE>
<TE>   My job now is to make sure little Claire doesn't grow up to be a
Charger fan.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Is Too Hot for Fire</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chicago Fire Coach Bob Bradley has the third most victories in Major
League Soccer with 74, but his albatross has been the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   And the Galaxy's 1-0 victory Saturday in front of an announced
crowd of 9,177 at Naperville, Ill.'s Cardinal Stadium did nothing to
change that. The Galaxy is 9-3-2 against the Fire since Coach Sigi
Schmid took over the team in April 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't feel like I'm 9-3-2 against them," Schmid said. "Bob is a
great coach and I have a lot of respect for him. I know we get
motivated to play Chicago."</LD>
<TE>   Although the record is somewhat lopsided, the games certainly
haven't been. Only once in those 14 games--a 3-1 Fire victory last
August--was the outcome decided by more than one goal.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been tight games," Bradley said. "Sometimes a play goes
their way and maybe we don't make a play. It's a small margin."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's game was decided by a tug of the jersey in the fifth
minute. Fire defender Jim Curtin chased Galaxy forward Carlos Ruiz
into the Fire's penalty area. Ruiz made a quick turn and Curtin stuck
out his arm and grabbed a handful of Ruiz's jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz fell to his knees after the contact and referee Alex Prus
immediately pointed to the penalty spot.</TE>
<TE>   With Zach Thornton lunging to his left, Ruiz calmly chipped his
penalty kick to the right for his league-leading seventh goal to give
the Galaxy (4-1-2) the only score it needed. The loss dropped the
Fire to 3-3-1.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are calls that are part of the game," Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   Rainy conditions for most of the game made it difficult for either
team to establish any type of a possession attack, but that didn't
bother Schmid.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy with the result," he said. "Sometimes the game is
beautiful and sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   New England 2, Dallas 0--Taylor Twellman scored two first-half
goals to give the Revolution a victory over the Burn in the first
sporting event at CMGI Field in Foxboro, Mass., in front of 22,006.</TE>
<TE>   Twellman, who joined the Revolution this year after failing to
break into the starting lineup at TSV 1860 Munich in Germany, has
scored four goals in his last three games.</TE>
<TE>   New England (2-2-1) opened the scoring in the sixth minute when
Joe Franchino passed to Twellman just outside the Dallas box and he
fired a 16-yard shot past goalkeeper Matt Jordan. Twellman scored
again in the 39th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 2, Kansas City 0--John Spencer had a goal and an assist
as the Rapids won at Denver in front of 23,020, beating the Wizards
for the first time in 12 meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Henderson added a goal for the Rapids (4-2-1), who last
defeated Kansas City on Sept. 25, 1999. The Wizards (1-3-2) are
winless in their last four games.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, New York/New Jersey 1--Ariel Graziani scored twice as
the Earthquakes won at San Jose in front of 8,445. The win kept the
Earthquakes (5-2-1) unbeaten in five straight games and atop the
Western Conference. New York/New Jersey (3-4-1) is tied for first in
the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In WUSA games:</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Washington 1--Erin Martin scored two goals and
Kelly Smith had a goal and an assist as the Charge won at Villanova,
Pa., in front of 8,185.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, the California state high school all-time leading scorer
from Temple City, was making only her second appearance and first
start of the season for Philadelphia (4-0-0).</TE>
<TE>   Boston 1, Carolina 1--Maren Meinert scored in the 65th minute as
the Breakers rallied to tie the Courage at Cary, N.C., in front of
5,816. Meinert scored on a rebound after goalkeeper Kristin
Luckenbill blocked Kristine Lilly's shot.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Atlanta 3--Krista Davey scored in stoppage time as the
Power overcame a two-goal deficit in the final six minutes to tie the
Beat at Atlanta in front of 6,973. After Atlanta's Kylie Bivens and
Sun Wen scored in a three-minute span in the second half, the Power
(1-3-1) pulled within one on Tiffeny Milbrett's goal in the 84th
minute.</TE>

<HD>Sanford Should Have More Jumps for Joy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't ever count out Michelle Sanford in an athletic competition.
Just when everything appears gloomy, Sanford delivers the required
extraordinary effort.</LD>
<LD>   She won the state girls' long jump championship two years ago as a
freshman at Irvine Woodbridge High on her final jump. She earned a
bronze medal at the World Youth national championships in Hungary
last summer in the triple jump on her final jump.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not over until the fat lady sings," Sanford said.</LD>
<TE>   It's almost as if Sanford enjoys keeping her supporters in
suspense by waiting until the last possible attempt to pull out
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the things that make her special, she competes so well and
can come up with a big performance," Coach George Varvas said.</TE>
<TE>   In Hungary, Sanford was in sixth place until she jumped a
career-best 43 feet 4 inches on her last attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "That was not natural ability or form, just pure competitiveness,"
Varvas said. "She's just a tiger when it comes to wanting to
accomplish something."</TE>
<TE>   Said Sanford: "I like it when it comes down to your final jump. I
tell myself, 'I'm going to jump this right now.' When I'm on the
runway, I have a clear mind, take off and hope for the best."</TE>
<TE>   And how does it feel to accomplish your goal?</TE>
<TE>   "It's pure blissful celebration," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sea View League championships May 3, she jumped a
nation-leading 42-5 1/2 to win the triple jump. She also won the long
jump and 100 meters and finished second in the 200. She figures to be
one of the top athletes at the Southern Section Division II finals on
Saturday at Cerritos College.</TE>
<TE>   Her talent certainly is helped by good bloodlines. Her father,
James, won the 440-yard state championship in 1977 while attending
Pasadena High. James went on to become a top sprinter at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford uses speed to give her the momentum to soar on her jumps.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of speed on the runway and my speed stays with me
the whole jump," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth High's baseball team started 19-0 and was ranked No. 1
in the nation in one poll. Then the Chancellors lost four of their
next six games, causing Coach Tom Meusborn to take drastic action.</TE>
<TE>   After a 4-3 loss to rival Woodland Hills El Camino Real on Monday,
Meusborn walked back to school while his players and assistant
coaches went on the bus. It was a 10-mile, 21/2-hour walk in his
uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "I just started walking, just trying to figure things out," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, people offered him a ride. He declined.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the first time he passed on a bus ride home. He did it
in the early 1990s after a similar loss to El Camino Real.</TE>
<TE>   His wife left him dinner on the stove.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Northern Regional individual golf qualifying tournament is
Monday at Sterling Hills in Camarillo. Keep an eye on junior Brandon
Beck of Oak Park. Sterling Hills is his home course and he's coming
off a Tri-Valley League season in which he won the individual title
by 26 strokes over his nearest competitor. Beck shot a 65 at Soule
Park in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "His driving and iron accuracy have really catapulted him," Coach
John Vogel said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spring football practice begins Monday for many Southern Section
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Cathedral, which has won six consecutive league
championships, could have one of its best teams because it picked up
several players from L.A. Verbum Dei, which has dropped football.</TE>
<TE>   The key transfers are quarterback Tim McDaniel and free safety
Duran Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   McDaniel will allow Cathedral to scrap its double-wing offense and
return to a spread passing game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers are sponsoring a four-on-four flag football
tournament next weekend at Victory Park in Pasadena. The championship
game of the high school division will be played at Staples Center
next month. Information: (310) 838-1422.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How many brother-sister combinations make it to Division I
schools? The Shoops from Malibu have pulled it off.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor Shoop, a senior pitcher at Los Angeles Loyola with a 4.1
grade-point average, will attend Davidson College on a baseball
scholarship. Shoop's sister Evan, a senior with a 4.0 GPA who plays
volleyball at L.A. Marymount, will attend Duke as a walk-on.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be living two hours apart in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Boyle can't remember the number of times people told him to
transfer during his high school career.</TE>
<TE>   "A bunch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boyle was an All-City receiver and defensive back at El Camino
Real. College coaches judged him a step too slow, so he's going to
attend College of the Canyons this fall to prove them wrong.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't believe the argument that if he had attended a more
successful football school he would have earned a scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter where you play--it's the player," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed at El Camino Real to be with his friends and play
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, he had the game-winning single to give El Camino Real
its win over Chatsworth and a West Valley League championship.</TE>
<TE>   He was mobbed, hugged and congratulated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all worth it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Teasley Looks Like Real Deal</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: Rookie point guard has 15 points, three
assists as Sparks beat Phoenix in exhibition opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The deal is looking like a steal.</LD>
<LD>   It may have been an exhibition game, and the Phoenix Mercury did
not have all its regulars available Saturday, but the debut of Nikki
Teasley, the Sparks' touted rookie guard, was the biggest highlight
of their 78-69 victory before 3,557 at the Pyramid in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Teasley, the fifth pick in this year's draft and traded to the
Sparks by Portland for Ukari Figgs, had 15 points and three assists
in 22 minutes. Lisa Leslie also had 15 points, and Mwadi Mabika and
Tamecka Dixon each scored 11 for Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Phoenix got 14 points each from Shea Mahoney and Adriana Moses.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little nervous early in the day but not when I got here,"
Teasley said after the Sparks' exhibition opener. "It's basketball on
a higher level, but I felt familiar with everything. I know we can
perform better as a team, and we will."</TE>
<TE>   Teasley provided some early excitement with half-court passes that
DeLisha Milton and Mabika converted into layups. She also made two
three-point shots and scored 12 points in 12 first-half minutes as
the Sparks took a 40-38 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley's third three-pointer, with 18:05 left in the second half,
triggered a 14-2 run that put the Sparks in control, 57-42.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Coach Michael Cooper began substituting, looking at
different combinations. Every Spark player in uniform got into the
game. Cooper may start reducing the 17-player roster Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "A win is a win, but we see how far we have to go," Cooper said.
"We practice harder than we played tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be difficult making cuts because we believe any player we
let go will be picked up by another team and become a crucial part of
that team. So we have to make the right choices."</TE>
<TE>   When Teasley's name was brought up, Cooper smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "She is everything we expected her to be," he said. "She's going
to be a special player. She's just going to get better and better."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks will play exhibitions next weekend in Detroit and
Orlando, then open the regular season at home against New York on May
25.</TE>

<LD>If Tim Duncan's comments Saturday were any indication, the Spurs were
starting to feel the heat entering Game 4 today against the Lakers at
the Alamodome. They realize a loss could be devastating.</LD>
<LD>   "The pressure is there," Duncan said a day after the Spurs fell
behind, 2-1, in the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal
series. "You hate to say it's a must-win game, but it really is.
We're not happy with the way we're playing right now."</LD>
<LD>   Toughest for the Spurs has been their faltering play late in each
of the first three games. The Spurs have been outscored by the Lakers
by a whopping 74-52 in the fourth quarters.</LD>
<TE>   Of particular concern was the Spurs' inability to make baskets in
Game 3. They made only eight of 22 (36.4%) shots in the fourth
quarter and watched the Lakers race to a 10-point victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Our game plan remains the same," guard Antonio Daniels said. "We
made a lot more mistakes than we're accustomed to [in Game 3]. The
shots didn't fall. We missed easy shots. We missed point-blank shots.
We missed perimeter shots.... We didn't take any bad shots."</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich was less troubled by the Spurs'
poor shooting than by other breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had opportunities to win all three games," he said. "It's
probably better not to say we've got to shoot better. For us, it's
decision-making. We've got to make better decisions and we'll be more
effective."</TE>
<TE>   As Duncan pointed out, "We were right there with seven or eight
minutes to go [in Game 3], then we made four or five mistakes in a
row."</TE>
<TE>   And as a result, the Lakers turned an 81-80 lead with 61/2 minutes
to play into a 99-89 victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Robinson appeared tentative with the ball in his hands
Friday, his first game after sitting since April 20 because of a sore
back. He missed a dunk, for instance. He also narrowly missed
shooting an airball on a fourth-quarter free throw. Another free
throw was so long it almost banked home.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little rusty," Robinson acknowledged. "I was trying to
get some good things to happen, but I was just glad to be back out on
the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson had six points and seven rebounds in 22 minutes. It's
uncertain whether Popovich will play Robinson more today in Game 4.
Robinson reported no lingering pain Saturday, according to Popovich.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems fine," Popovich said. "He said he feels good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Malik Rose, an energetic reserve forward, said he wouldn't
complain if Robinson's return to fitness means he plays less and less
as the series progresses. Rose and Robinson kept Laker center
Shaquille O'Neal from scoring in the fourth quarter Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "David probably plays Shaq better than anyone else in the league,"
Rose said. "[Popovich] doesn't have to worry about juggling minutes
with me."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers would just as soon see Popovich keep Rose on the bench.
He has proved to be too quick for O'Neal to guard and too physical
for several of the Laker forwards.</TE>

<HD>Strategically, Pressure Is on Spurs to Make Adjustments</HD>

<LD>In the Lakers' Game 3 victory Friday over San Antonio, Phil Jackson
did more coaching and sweating than he probably did over the 82-game
regular season. Shaquille O'Neal had nearly as many rebounds (15) as
the Spurs' Tim Duncan had missed shots (17), and Kobe Bryant's 11
fourth-quarter points made up for his last-second turnover in the
Lakers' loss in Game 2.</LD>
<LD>   But the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series is far
from over, making Los Angeles' approach to today's Game 4 critical. A
victory would all but guarantee the Lakers a spot in the Western
Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly the pressure is on the Spurs, who must develop a strategy
that prevents the Lakers from taking a 3-1 lead in the series and
forcing San Antonio to win three games in a row--including two games
at Staples Center--to advance.</LD>
<TE>   A strategic breakdown for Game 4:</TE>
<TE>   SPURS' MOVE--Coach Gregg Popovich has to find a way to get more
movement in the halfcourt offense. Too many times the Spurs stood
around and looked for Duncan to make a play. As they learned Friday,
this tactic isn't good enough against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   To get more ball movement, Popovich should go small and play
Antonio Daniels and Bruce Bowen with rookie Tony Parker, whose
quickness has given the Lakers problems.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels and Parker are the only Spurs who can penetrate and San
Antonio's attack isn't as stagnant with them on the court at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Spurs' top perimeter shooters--Steve Smith (nine
points in 40 minutes on Friday) and Danny Ferry (one three-point
basket in Games 2 and 3)--are not getting it done, Popovich doesn't
have anything to lose.</TE>
<TE>   David Robinson made his first appearance of the series Friday and
had only seven rebounds, six points and five fouls in 22 minutes. San
Antonio is more productive when Malik Rose is on the court and
Popovich can't afford to stick with his normal rotation of big men.
Rose should play more than 25 minutes, his total in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio also has to do a better job of forcing O'Neal to the
free-throw line. He attempted only four in Game 3, which is not
enough for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--Jackson's decision to start Robert Horry at power
forward in place of Samaki Walker gave Los Angeles instant energy at
the start of the first and third quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Horry is a pressure player, and Walker responded well with 12
points and five rebounds in 16 minutes off the bench. Horry is crafty
and gives Duncan problems with an assortment of defensive tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the biggest change in Game 3 for the Lakers was when their
perimeter players stepped around San Antonio screens instead of going
underneath them. O'Neal received credit for his inside play Friday,
but he became a factor on the outside by helping to defend the Spurs'
screen-and-roll plays.</TE>
<TE>   Another key in Game 3 was Jackson's decision to give more
prime-time minutes to role players such as Devean George and Brian
Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   Although they combined for only two points, their hustle plays on
defense were noteworthy.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINTS--San Antonio has shown plenty of heart but the Lakers
simply demonstrated a greater will to win Game 3. Because of O'Neal's
dominating presence inside and Bryant's ability to create offensive
opportunities, Los Angeles seldom gets credit for its defense. But
defense has been the backbone to its consecutive titles and that will
be the case again if the Lakers make it three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 3, the Lakers' pick-and-roll plays with Bryant and O'Neal
proved troublesome for the Spurs. San Antonio's defenders had a
difficult time getting around O'Neal and that was all Bryant needed
as he scored a game-high 31 points.</TE>
<TE>   When the Spurs adjusted their defense to stop Bryant, Derek Fisher
was able to make three of five three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   This tactic also helped create more space for Rick Fox, who made a
couple of key mid-range jump shots in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>UCLA and Stanford Again in Final</HD>

<LD>It's time for a rematch.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA women's water polo championship game pits Stanford
against defending champion UCLA a year after the two played in the
inaugural title game. The two also met April 28 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation title game, which UCLA won.</LD>
<LD>   Neither second-seeded UCLA (22-3) nor top-seeded Stanford (22-2)
faced much resistance in setting up the showdown. UCLA defeated
third-seeded Loyola Marymount, 11-2, after Stanford beat
fourth-seeded Michigan, 13-3, at USC's McDonald's Swim Stadium on
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA jumped to a 2-0 lead when freshman Amber Stachowski scored
the first of her two goals and senior Kelly Heuchan netted the first
of her game-high three goals in the first two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into today, we were expecting a hard-fought game with their
senior-laden team," UCLA Coach Adam Krikorian said. "The big thing
for us was getting off to a good start. Getting the two quick goals
was key. Once we did that I knew we were in good shape."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA--a physically bigger team than the Lions--overpowered Loyola
(20-8) for most of the game. The Lions' only goals came in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The slow start hurt us," said Loyola Coach John Loughran, who had
five seniors attend graduation ceremonies before Saturday's
semifinal. "With them scoring on their first two possessions, I think
it set the tone early."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA led, 6-0, at halftime and 10-2 after three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We averaged giving up 4.5 goals per game," Loughran said. "We
gave up too many easy goals today, and that's uncharacteristic of us.
Our goal was to keep them under six, even eight would have been OK."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were able to use the semifinal as preparation for the
title game since Loyola uses a similar style on defense as Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time these two teams get together, it's an exciting match,"
said UCLA junior Robin Beauregard.</TE>
<TE>   The championship game is scheduled for 5 p.m. at McDonald's Swim
Stadium, after the third-place game between Loyola and Michigan
(25-12) at 3:30 p.m.</TE>
