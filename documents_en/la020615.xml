<HD>They're Rockin' at the Multiplex</HD>
<DH>Digital technology allows cinemas to beam in concerts, but
the jury is out on whether it will be just a fad.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Monday night and you stroll into the neighborhood movie theater
to invest two hours in big-screen entertainment and popcorn, but
instead of the latest Tom Cruise flick you watch ... the Rolling
Stones live from a London club? Or Madonna in Spain? How about Barbra
Streisand in Las Vegas?</LD>
<LD>   The concept of watching a hot-ticket concert anywhere in the world
beamed live into a multiplex may sound thrilling or just plain odd,
depending on your point of view, but don't rule it out as a
possibility. The music industry and movie-house chains took the
first, tentative step into the area this week by bringing the rock
band Korn, live and loud, into theaters in 30 U.S. markets, including
the Bridge Theater in Westchester.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles band was actually prowling the stage at the
Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, but thanks to a satellite and new
digital technology available at select movie houses, they were also
on silver screens across the country in front of about 6,000 fans.
The promotion cost the band a few hundred thousand dollars, its
manager says, but singer Jonathan Davis said it gave them a chance to
celebrate the release of their new album, "Untouchables," by reaching
out to fans in a novel way.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very, very hard to think of original things to do these
days, and this seemed like a way not only to experiment with
something really cool but also play in front of a lot of our fans in
different places all at once," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also said the idea of Korn fans taking over a movie theater
en masse reminded him of the fleeting late-night communities created
by "The Last Waltz," "The Song Remains the Same," "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show" and other music films that became ritual viewing for
fans. "This is even better," Davis said, "because it's live and
anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   One thing music industry and film exhibitors would like to see
happen is the creation of a new revenue stream. At this point it is
impossible to predict whether concerts will become a new staple of
cinema house programming or a blip on the screen that lasts as long
as 3D glasses.</TE>
<TE>   The concert business has been flat in recent months, losing fans
who opt to stay home and buy DVDs instead of venturing out to
high-priced shows. Moreover, hip-hop and rap, among the dominant
music genres in the past decade, have not yet become a reliable
concert draw. The mood of promoters was especially grim after Sept.
11 as travel and drawing large public crowds became increasingly
difficult, and the hangover has not been cured completely.</TE>
<TE>   Theater chains, meanwhile, are under pressure from the Hollywood
studios to equip their cinemas for digital films. The price tag of
digital projection equipment--up to $200,000--is so daunting that
many in the business question its value. But some advocates of
digital technology say the payoff is in the alternate programming
that the new equipment makes possible, such as live concerts,
educational programs, corporate functions and other special events.
At the very least, they say, the extra offerings could help fill
seats from Monday to Thursday, when moviegoing usually drops off.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Maltz, president of Avica Technology Corp., a player in the
digital arena, points to a Canadian movie theater chain's success
with the exhibition of pro wrestling events, and the AMC movie
theater chain's test runs with Broadway productions as signposts of
what is to come.</TE>
<TE>   Maltz has heard the naysayers who argue that shoehorning live
events into the antiseptic environment of a multiplex just adds more
distance between art and audience, and ultimately is more a novelty
than a new frontier. How can staring at a movie screen compare with
going to a club or theater and enjoying live music that has not been
filtered through a high-tech machine? There is also the matter of
economics--movie exhibitor chains may not be willing or able to
handle the financial strains of going digital.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to be negative about these things, but sometimes with
something this new you risk it dying on the vine if you are too
negative," Maltz said. "I'd tell the skeptics to try it and see how
they like it before they judge."</TE>
<TE>   Maltz points to the 18,000 fans of the Los Angeles Lakers who paid
$10 for seats at Staples Center this week to watch the team's East
Coast victory over the New Jersey Nets on the arena's monitors.
Lacking the opportunity to watch the event in person, they still paid
for the communal vibe of a large audience, which Maltz said is a
strong indicator of what theaters could do with far better image and
sound to offer.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment is echoed by Ray Nutt, executive vice president of
business development for Regal CineMedia, a specialty company within
the Regal Entertainment Group. It was the Regal chain that brought
the Monday performance to Korn fans, most of whom paid $10 or got
their tickets through radio station giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a wonderful event for us, a larger-than-life screen, great
sound, and the kids were dancing in the aisles, literally," Nutt
said. "One interesting take on it all was that a lot of parents who
have kids that they consider too young to let go to a concert to see
the band said they felt much safer and more comfortable bringing them
to a theater.... I think we're obviously on to something here. I
think it's not out of the question that there might be, for example,
a concert night at theaters once a month or something like that."</TE>
<TE>   The projectors that showed the Korn event were a lower-priced
variety, about $20,000 each, but still delivered a higher-quality
image that caught the eye of different people in the music industry.
The Dixie Chicks and several other acts are already sizing up the
idea of the theater-as-promotional-tool, says Peter Katsis, a manager
with the Firm, the powerful management company whose clients include
Korn and the Chicks.</TE>
<TE>   Concerts West and Spring Communications were also part of the team
that engineered the Korn performance project, and Katsis said while
the first-time effort was expensive and intensive, he would expect
that practice would streamline the entire endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are hoping this takes off and it's pretty
exciting if you think about the possibilities," Katsis said. "It's a
big idea to put this music on the big screen."</TE>

<HD>'All Men Are Sons': Fathers' Lifelong Effect</HD>
<DH>A documentary looks at young men and their relationships
with Dad, thought-provoking if unlikely viewing Sunday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL GREENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"All Men Are Sons" should carry an OG rating for fathers: Offspring
Guidance recommended. Absent such advice from their sons, thousands
of unsuspecting dads may plunk themselves down this Father's Day
weekend thinking they're going to see the feel-good documentary of
the year, a veritable cavalcade of Robert-Young-and-son vignettes a
la "Father Knows Best."</LD>
<LD>   But nooo.... Psychologist Terrence Real intrudes on our visions of
a chore-less Sunday of eggs Benedict in bed followed by playing golf,
watching it (the final round of the U.S. Open) and being otherwise
pampered by adoring family members.</LD>
<LD>   And oh, does he intrude. As a prescription for fatherhood, this
show is like reading a medicine bottle's "possible side effects"
label in excruciating detail.</LD>
<TE>   The hourlong documentary (showing today on KLCS-TV and Sunday on
KCET-TV) thrusts us into the world of five sons, ranging in age from
18 to 33, all of whom have been thoughtlessly, casually scarred by
Daddy Dearest.</TE>
<TE>   In a round-table session that would make Bobby Knight sob, each
struggles to cope with his father's dubious legacy. The soliloquies
are interspersed with scenes of their lives during the past
year--kind of like the Osbournes without a sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar, 18, tells how his father "moved out as soon as he found out
[my mother] was pregnant with me" and left him constantly searching
for guidance from an adult male. Ted, 33, had to suffer the emotional
reverberations of his father's experiences in a U.S. relocation camp
for people of Japanese ancestry during World War II ("I didn't say
the word 'love' to my father until I was 18," he says). Jonah, a
32-year-old singer-musician, got to experience his father for the
first five years of his life before the man left his family. "I
didn't see him for 15 years before he died of alcoholism," Jonah
recalls. And so on. There is some self-indulgence going on here; one
is tempted at times to yell at each of these men: "Grow up, bubbie.
Get over it."</TE>
<TE>   But surprisingly, by the show's end, all of these guys do seem to
grow up. They resolve their feelings for their fathers--living and
dead--and they're the better for it. Oscar, for example, visits his
father in Mexico; after awkwardly trying to talk things out, the two
men finally, touchingly, hug goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "All Men Are Sons" is thoughtful and layered with emotional
subtleties that men rarely express, especially in terms of their
relationships with their fathers (and their sons). But viewer beware:
This show makes one realize how a careless word, an overreaction, an
under-reaction, too much guidance or too little guidance can turn
your boy into a tangled mass of resentment, hatred and confusion.</TE>
<TE>   So sons: Don't let your dad watch this unless you think he can
handle it. And pass the eggs Benedict, please.</TE>

<LD>So, it turns out that in addition to tearing down most of the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, per architect Rem Koolhaas' scheme, the
leadership is also considering a name change--to the Los Angeles
County Museums of Art.</LD>
<LD>   Koolhaas' design calls for five separate, but linked, centers:
American, Asian, European, Latin, and modern and contemporary art.
The LACMA board is considering naming each center (i.e., museum) for
a major donor to the project. The idea could also solve the problem
of honoring past donors (Ahmanson, Anderson) whose buildings will be
demolished.</LD>
<LD>   Museum director Andrea Rich won't even speak sotto voce about this
matter, but board member Janet Karatz--while unwilling to provide
details--said the naming issue has been very much on the table at
many board meetings. "We are addressing this with so much respect to
our past donors, and our present donors; that is very important to
us."</LD>
<TE>   What isn't yet clear is how much it'll take to get your name on
one of the "museums." Total cost of the project is estimated between
$200 million and $300 million.</TE>

<HD>Putting a Face on Book Heroes</HD>
<DH>In 'Bourne Identity,' Matt Damon continues as Mr.
Adaptation</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems hard to believe in this era of comic-book film heroes and
video-game spinoffs, but back in the 1930s and '40s Hollywood would
cast its biggest stars in adaptations of classic and popular novels.
In fact, Hollywood and the literary world were so intertwined that
writers would even create characters in their novels based on popular
actors.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember reading that Margaret Mitchell actually wrote the
character of Rhett Butler in 'Gone With the Wind' with Clark Gable in
mind," said Rick Jewell, associate dean of USC's School of
Cinema-Television. Likewise, Ernest Hemingway was a good friend of
Gary Cooper, who starred in the adaptation of Papa's novels "A
Farewell to Arms" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls."</LD>
<LD>   "Was Hemingway actually writing characters based on the rugged
all-American qualities of Gary Cooper?" Jewell wonders. "I don't
know, but without a question there were certain actors back then that
people thought of or wanted whenever there was kind of a hero type
from the novels that were being adapted."</LD>
<TE>   Though he was born a decade after Gable and Cooper died, Matt
Damon is a throwback to an earlier era of Hollywood perhaps because
he shares some of the on-screen qualities of those screen
legends--charisma, intelligence, integrity-- that make him desirable
as a screen incarnation of a literary hero.</TE>
<TE>   In the past five years, he's starred in adaptations of such
popular mainstream novels as John Grisham's "The Rainmaker" as well
as more literary works--Patricia Highsmith's "The Talented Mr.
Ripley," Steven Pressfield's "The Legend of Bagger Vance" and Cormac
McCarthy's "All the Pretty Horses." His latest foray into the book
world is an adaptation of another popular bestseller in the Grisham
vein, the Robert Ludlum spy thriller "The Bourne Identity," which
opened to strong reviews on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something kind of ageless and timeless about him,"
"Bourne Identity" casting director Joseph Middleton said of Damon.
"So he fits into a lot of periods. There is something very smart
about Matt in the way he carries himself. I don't know Matt's thought
process about his choices, but his choices are very much of an older
theatrical actor."</TE>
<TE>   Damon, who won an Oscar for his 1997 screenplay of "Good Will
Hunting" with good buddy Ben Affleck, said he's discovered that "in
script form the characters from novels are more clearly drawn and the
level of variety seems to be higher in general. There is so much
source material to draw on in the novel."</TE>
<TE>   Despite, or rather, because of his choirboy good looks and
accessible demeanor, Damon is determined to avoid being typecast as a
boy-next-door type. And so far, he's never been pigeonholed. The
actor has played everything from an idealistic young Southern lawyer
in "The Rainmaker" to a disillusioned down-and-out golfer who gets a
chance at redemption in "Bagger Vance" to a manipulative, charming
psychotic killer in "The Talented Mr. Ripley." In "The Bourne
Identity," Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesiac who discovers he's
actually a trained killer working for the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be really boring to do the same thing over and over
again," Damon said in a recent interview in Los Angeles, as he calmly
puffed on his ever-present cigarettes. "I love doing different things
and different genres, too. With this one ["The Bourne Identity"], I
had never done an 'action' movie before."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even more than a Gable or a Cooper, Damon recalls the
early career path of Montgomery Clift, the handsome, youthful actor
who came to fame in the late '40s and refused to be typecast in
heroic parts.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see Damon in several of the less sympathetic roles
Clift made famous, such as the fortune hunter in "The Heiress," based
on Henry James' "Washington Square" or the ambitious young man who
murders his pregnant girlfriend in "A Place in the Sun," the
Oscar-winning adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy."
Similarly, in films like "Ripley," Damon showed that he wasn't afraid
to explore the darker side.</TE>
<TE>   "Montgomery Clift seems to have more demons than Matt has," says
Middleton. But like Clift, "he's not afraid of showing all sides of
the coin. He is not backing away from anything that appears
unacceptable or unlikable. In fact, it seems he relishes that."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has had mixed results with its recent ventures into the
literary world. For every success like the adaptations of John
Irving's "The Cider House Rules" and Stephen King's "The Green Mile,"
there have been such commercial and critical flops such as Annie
Proulx's "The Shipping News," Frank McCourt's "Angela's Ashes,"
Stephen King's "Hearts in Atlantis" and McCarthy's "All the Pretty
Horses." Some of these adaptations, such as "Shipping News" and
"Angela's Ashes," failed at the box office, even though they had the
blessings of their authors. In the case of "All the Pretty Horses,"
Damon says that the film didn't succeed because it was cut by more
than an hour before its release.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a three-hour-and-15-minute movie and it was still I think
the best thing I had ever done," said Damon, who played a young Texas
cowboy who comes of age in the drama. "I thought it was just
beautiful. But the movie we made never saw the light of day. I was
tremendously disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Damon acknowledged that fans of certain novels have set
ideas of what the film version should be like. "The better the book
the more pressure there is," to satisfy those readers, notes Damon.</TE>
<TE>   Damon discovered when he met Grisham and McCarthy while making the
movie versions of their novels that they weren't really worried about
film-book comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   "Cormac said, 'I'm a novelist and this is the book I wrote,' "
recalled Damon. " 'Nothing is going to change that book. I am fine
with the movie being made, but I am not concerned about putting my
thumbprint on it because the book is what I did.' Grisham's reaction
was similar to Cormac's."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Marshall, the executive producer of "The Bourne Identity,"
discovered during production just how serious Damon is about his
craft. "One of the great things about work on the movie was the
collaboration between director Doug Liman and Matt. They sort of set
a benchmark for this character, and Matt was the keeper of the
character."</TE>
<TE>   Damon does extensive preparation for every role. For example,
Grisham's novel gave Damon insight into the background of his
character in "The Rainmaker," attorney Rudy Baylor. "The character
grew up in Knoxville and moved to Memphis and we did our shooting in
Memphis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But Knoxville was on the other side of the state from Memphis. So
I drove down to Knoxville by myself and lived in and bartended in
Knoxville to get the accent. I wanted the accent to be a blend.
Memphis is a much more cosmopolitan accent, and in Knoxville you are
right by the mountains next to North Carolina and it's got a twang to
it. I was very conscious with the scenes with my family to have a
little bit more of Knoxville come out, and when I was in court to try
to be more Memphis."</TE>
<TE>   On "The Bourne Identity," screenwriter Tony Gilroy never read the
Ludlum bestseller on which the film is based. "The character is the
same as the book, but the story is very different from the Ludlum
story, which is all about Carlos the Jackal," said Damon. "Tony took
it in a whole other direction." Gilroy, who previously adapted
Stephen King's "Dolores Claiborne" with mixed results, even made
Bourne a decade younger than he is in the novel.</TE>
<TE>   Damon read the book in 1990 and then again when he got the role
"to see if there was anything in there to help. But I had found that
Tony had taken it so far afield [that] everything I needed was in the
script, so I didn't reference the book much after that." Damon did,
though, spend six months preparing for the part of Bourne by boxing,
learning martial arts and being trained to use handguns.</TE>
<TE>   "Bourne Identity" isn't the first time he played a character on
screen that deviated sharply from the one in the novel. In the case
of "Ripley," writer-director Anthony Minghella's adaptation was
vastly different in tone from Highsmith's novel. "The book has this
fun spirit," says Damon. "It is fun to kill these people. Highsmith
didn't like these rich people and wanted Ripley to kill them. Anthony
wanted it to be about his descent into purgatory. So it is no mistake
that on the boat when I am sailing I am reading Dante's 'Inferno.' "</TE>
<TE>   The actor still has writing aspirations of his own. He and Casey
Affleck, the younger brother of Ben, co-wrote and star in the
upcoming comedy "Gerry," which reunites them with "Good Will Hunting"
director Gus Van Sant.</TE>
<TE>   Damon would like to try adapting a novel, but he knows how
difficult the experience is. "Anthony Minghella is good at adapting,
but I know from talking to him it is such a terrific responsibility,"
said Damon. "He feels enormous pressure he really doesn't want."</TE>

<HD>Before Stones' Stop, Wiltern Will Lose Floor-Level Seats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It'll literally be standing room only when the Stones roll into the
Wiltern Theatre this fall--at least downstairs.</LD>
<LD>   When the Rolling Stones' tour, which opens Sept. 5 in Boston,
reaches the Wiltern on Nov. 4, all floor-level seats will have been
removed as part of a $2-million renovation by Clear Channel
Entertainment, which operates the 71-year-old Art Deco landmark.</LD>
<LD>   For the Stones show, that will mean general admission on the
floor, with neither tables nor chairs in front of the stage,
according to a band spokeswoman. The balcony will still be set up for
reserved seating.</LD>
<TE>   Ticket-holders' order confirmation forms indicate whether they
have received general admission tickets or seats in one of the
reserved seating sections.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel announced last summer its intention to revamp the
Wiltern's interior to allow for dinner seating at certain events.
Officials at the entertainment giant said the Wiltern's primary role
would remain that of a pop concert facility, with gospel musicals,
comedy shows, dance and other events sprinkled into the mix. The plan
also calls for a 1,200-square-foot dance floor to be installed in
front of the stage and for alcoholic beverages to be served inside
the hall as well as in lobby bars, additions Clear Channel officials
expect will expand the Wiltern's potential audience.</TE>
<TE>   The change would increase the Wiltern's capacity from its current
maximum of 2,200 to a figure that Clear Channel officials haven't
specified. The Wiltern is the smallest venue so far announced for the
Stones tour, which mixes stadiums, arenas and smaller theaters in
various cities. The other Southland stops are Oct. 31 at Staples
Center and Nov. 2 at Edison International Field in Anaheim. Tickets
are still available only for the Edison Field show, according to the
official tour Web site, www.rollingstones.com.</TE>

<LD>   Spielberg Puts 'Challenge' First</LD>
<LD>   Steven Spielberg plans to shoot a fourth "Indiana Jones" movie in
2004, and he has directed a host of high-grossing fantasy and
adventure films. But he passed on the chance to direct "Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "Spider-Man," which hasn't gone over
well with his kids.</LD>
<TE>   "[I told them] 'This is Daddy's time now; this is the time for me
to do things that will challenge me,' " he recalled in an interview
promoting his new film, "Minority Report," starring Tom Cruise. "And
those two films would not have been a challenge for me."</TE>
<TE>   Though commercial success is nice, adds the 55-year-old director,
it's not sufficient in itself:</TE>
<TE>   "It's always fun to see those huge grosses come in, but it's not
creatively stimulating to me anymore. Right now, I'm just trying to
find things that really make me excited, not necessarily the things
that make kids excited."</TE>

<TE>   Anti-Indian Song Fuels Tensions in South Africa</TE>
<TE>   South Africa's most prominent black playwright has created a furor
in his homeland with a song he wrote, accusing people of Indian
ancestry of exploiting and abusing black Africans in that country.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent Indians are calling him a racist, African National
Congress legislators have urged radio stations to stop playing the
song and former President Nelson Mandela has asked him to apologize,
according to the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mbongeni Ngema, who was responsible for such hits as
"Sarafina!" and "Woza Albert!," is standing firm. The song, he says,
was written to start a dialogue between Africans and Indians, who
entered South Africa as indentured servants in the 1800s and now make
up 3% of the population. A hierarchy developed among the Indians and
darker-skinned South Africans, leading to a series of violent clashes
over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I would be trampling on people's toes," Ngema says. "But
the emergence of this song has given Africans hope that finally this
can be spoken about."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, an industry
regulatory group, will consider banning the song from the air on the
grounds that it incites violence.</TE>
<TE>   Ngema says he hopes to perform in concert with Indian musicians
and to discuss the issue in public meetings.</TE>
<TE>   It's 'Sir Mick' to You Now, Mate</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone Mick Jagger, the aging rock 'n' roll rebel renowned
for his drug arrests and female conquests, will finally get some
satisfaction from Britain's establishment today when he is awarded a
knighthood.</TE>
<TE>   "Old Rubber Lips," a boyhood hero of Prime Minister Tony Blair's,
won his knighthood "for services to popular music," according to the
list of honors published to mark Queen Elizabeth's official birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very pleased. I was also surprised because I must admit I
wasn't expecting to get it," Jagger told Reuters Television. "It is
great to get an honor from your own country--although I have had
honors from other countries. It also reflects really wonderfully on
all the achievements of the Rolling Stones over the last 40 years."</TE>
<TE>   Newman Defends Rapper Eminem</TE>
<TE>   Randy Newman was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in New
York on Thursday night, along with Michael Jackson, Barry Manilow and
Sting. And he took the opportunity to serve up some praise for the
controversial rapper Eminem, who he said is someone he can "identify
with."</TE>
<TE>   "He is not serious.... He's a comic artist," Newman, 58, said of
Eminem, who has been criticized for using slurs against gays and
women and for the violent imagery of his music. "And since that's
essentially what I am, he's a kindred spirit in some kind of way."</TE>
<TE>   Newman knows what it's like to be on the defensive. The
singer-songwriter faced critics when "Short People" was released in
the late 1970s. Many were infuriated by the song's chorus, which
contained the lyrics "short people have no reason to live."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Liza Minnelli has signed a deal with Clive Davis' J Records to
release a live CD by October. The project, produced by Phil Ramone,
will contain material from her "Liza's Back!" New York shows and a
fall concert in Las Vegas, where she's returning after a five-year
absence, USA Today reports.... The team of Richard Meier, who
designed the Getty Center and the Beverly Hills branch of the Museum
of Television and Radio, and Arata Isozaki, who designed Los Angeles'
Museum of Contemporary Art, are among the three finalists to redesign
Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall in New York City. The others: Jose
Raphael Moneo, who designed the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels
in downtown L.A., and Sir Norman Foster, who is a finalist to design
the Natural History Museum in Exposition Park.... "Let's Make a Deal"
host Monty Hall, 78, is expected to return home today after breaking
his hip in a fall while putting on his pants after a medical checkup
at Cedars-Sinai Hospital.... A 2,000-year-old sculpture known as the
Jenkins Venus or the Barberini Venus sold at auction for $11.7

<HD>'Witchblade' Cuts to the Chase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It isn't every daughter who can hand out a guest-starring spot on a
TV show as a Father's Day gift, but "Witchblade's" Yancy Butler has
that kind of clout these days.</LD>
<LD>   Her TNT series, whose two-hour pilot notched the best ratings of
2000 for a basic-cable original movie, opens its second season Sunday
at 8 p.m. with another two-hour effort, with proud papa Joe Butler
turning in a serviceable effort as the grizzled father of a runaway
teen.</LD>
<LD>   Although it's his first acting job on television, Joe Butler is no
stranger to the spotlight. Two years ago, he was inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as the original drummer for the Lovin'
Spoonful ("Do You Believe in Magic," "Summer in the City"), and he
also acted on Broadway in "Mahogany" and with the original cast of
"Hair."</LD>
<TE>   But it's doubtful that any of that could have prepared him for the
hair-raising goings-on in "Witchblade," where gory impalements, live
burials and occasional vomiting are the order of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Yancy Butler returns as New York detective Sara Pezzini, who comes
to possess a mysterious ancient weapon that seems to bring her as
much trouble as anything else. The Witchblade is so powerful that it
has yanked the series into flashback mode, and so in the first hour
we see how Pezzini and the Blade became as one.</TE>
<TE>   As the detective (and new viewers) slowly come to understand the
weapon's characteristics and identify those who would have it for
themselves, the action heats up. But Pezzini's relentlessly glowering
dourness spoils much of the fun, and when a flip line is heard--"That
blade must be duller than Hillary Clinton's libido"--it feels as if
we've got our channels crossed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Witchblade" assumes its regular time slot Monday at 9 p.m. with a
new hourlong episode.</TE>

<DH>Art* 'Splendors of Imperial Japan' highlights Meiji Period
treasures at the Portland Art Museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GILLIAN FLACCUS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>PORTLAND, Ore. -- Three bronze demons with pointed teeth, shaggy hair
and wild eyes glare menacingly from beneath a massive urn decorated
with stylized clouds and ribbons.</LD>
<LD>   A bronze eagle perches atop the life-sized sculpture as the
demons, like Atlas, struggle to hold the urn aloft with their
rippling biceps.</LD>
<LD>   The mighty incense burner is one of hundreds of vases, sculptures
and textiles on display in "Splendors of Imperial Japan," an exhibit
on view at the Portland Art Museum through Sept. 22.</LD>
<TE>   The 350-piece show, owned by Dr. Nasser D. Khalili of London, is
dedicated to an artistic explosion that occurred in the late 1800s as
Japan emerged from centuries of self-imposed isolation.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition explores art produced during the Meiji Period, a
brief and intense span that bridged the gap between 250 years of
isolationism and Japan's role as a world power. It is Khalili's first
major Japanese exhibit on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1868 and 1912--just 44 years--Japanese artists threw
themselves into their work, inventing techniques and materials to
create what many experts consider the highest-quality art of its
time.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese decided that after 250 years of isolation they would
embrace the rest of the world," said Donald Jenkins, the Portland Art
Museum's curator of Asian art. "They did it in superb fashion. It was
like a time warp."</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. Navy appeared off Japan's coast in 1854, the country
realized its industrial and military weakness and rushed to make a
name for itself the only way it knew how. "They were so concerned
about being looked down upon, as being considered Third World," said
Jenkins. "One thing they could do before they had any industry was
make art."</TE>
<TE>   In 1867, the ruling Emperor Komei died and the last shogun
resigned. The new Meiji emperor, Mutsuhito, made sweeping reforms to
modernize the country. He patronized the nation's best artists,
paying them handsomely to create high-quality artwork for export to
Europe and America, and invested in elaborate pavilions at a string
of world fairs.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to emphasize art was also a practical one. Artisans
whose only work had been to decorate swords and make ivory belt hooks
suddenly had no customers. The new regime needed cash quickly and
art, initially, was its only resource.</TE>
<TE>   "They were hungry, and I think they were wise," said Khalili.
"Religion has its own language, politics has its own language, but
the only language which is universal is the language of art."</TE>
<TE>   Within several years, Japan's best artists were producing
exquisite works in ivory, lacquer, enamel, bronze, porcelain and
metal alloys unknown to the West. These pieces, the best of which
make up the Khalili collection, were treasured in Europe and America
for their exotic look and fine craftsmanship.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to entice the West, the Meiji artists focused on themes that
seem almost Victorian to attract foreign buyers. The art also
emphasized Japanese traditions and locations that were known to the
West, including famous tourist attractions and sculptures and
paintings of daily life.</TE>
<TE>   "They were in such a rush to catch up that everything was Western
and there was a tendency to neglect their own culture," Jenkins said.
"In one sense, it's like globalism had already occurred. Victorian
taste and eclecticism had already shown up in Japan."</TE>
<TE>   Early Meiji pieces in the collection improve on the ornate,
heavily decorated works that were favored in the West. Extravagant
enameled and gilded vases from the 1880s by master Yabu Meizan depict
pastoral scenes framed by countless tiny flowers in red, white and
orange.</TE>
<TE>   The rush to cater to the West didn't last long, however.</TE>
<TE>   By the turn of the century, there was a backlash against
Western-looking pieces and artists reverted to sparser designs with
negative space and traditional themes.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its Western influence, Meiji art was shunned and
forgotten in Japan for decades. Most Japanese were not familiar with
the period because nearly all the pieces were exported.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where does Mark Cantor find all these things? Year after year he
presents a full evening of jazz on film to enthralled audiences as
part of the free events leading up to the Playboy Jazz Festival
(which takes place today and Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl).</LD>
<LD>   Thursday night, in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Bing
Theater, Cantor did it again. And even though many of the items had
been seen before, the imaginativeness of his program, coupled with
the inclusion of a few never-before-seen clips, made for yet another
extraordinarily entertaining evening.</LD>
<LD>   The program was divided into four individual sets. "Hittin' on the
88s," devoted to pianists, included a previously unscreened segment
featuring a 1950 performance of "Humoresque" by the legendary Art
Tatum. Fascinating, in an entirely different fashion, was a 1943
showboat boogie-woogie performance by the elegant Hazel Scott, as
well as clips featuring Oscar Peterson, Marian McPartland, Willie
"The Lion" Smith and the Dave Brubeck Quartet.</LD>
<TE>   Set No. 2, "Ballad Potpourri," was dominated by a newly discovered
1961 clip of the John Coltrane Quartet playing "I Want to Talk About
You." The performance is stunning, with Coltrane's solo revealing the
transitioning from his harmonically layered improvising of the '50s
into the free expressiveness of his '60s playing.</TE>
<TE>   Another segment, featuring the unlikely pairing of Coleman Hawkins
and Charlie Parker, included some dazzling improvising, especially
from Parker. But as with a number of other clips, the sound was
recorded before the video was shot, thereby presenting the musicians
with the difficult task of matching their fingering movements to
their previous improvisations--not an easy task.</TE>
<TE>   "Politically Incorrect," segment No. 3, included an intriguing
group of three vocal performances, by Sarah Vaughan, Abby Lincoln and
June Christy, as well as a spirited 1957 encounter between Dizzy
Gillespie and Louis Armstrong. Two aspects of "political
incorrectness" were dealt with via Charlie Barnet's 1944 "Cherokee,"
in which white musicians mimed the playing of the Barnet band's black
soloists on the audio track (to pacify the Southern audiences of the
period), and a 1941 performance by the remarkable scat singer Leo
Watson (in which the African American musicians leave a craps game to
perform their number).</TE>
<TE>   The final segment, "Jazz Potpourri," ranged from Benny Goodman and
Savoy Sultans to Mamie Smith before concluding with two superb items:
Freddie Hubbard's exquisite version of "Blue Moon" with the Art
Blakey Band, and Charles Mingus' "So Long Eric," notable primarily
for the too-brief solo passages by the remarkable alto saxophonist
Eric Dolphy.</TE>

<HD>A Couch Potato Shares His Twice-Baked Dreams</HD>

<LD>Back around the time that "I want my MTV" was a trendy marketing
slogan, I got it into my head that cable was going to be the answer
to every couch potato's prayers--each of us individually, I mean.
With more new channels every year, most of them desperate for cheap
programming, every niche would be scratched, every series, special,
movie and play ever telecast would be recycled somewhere, sometime.</LD>
<LD>   Man, was I wrong. The economics of cable may allow for a channel
devoted to golf or cooking but not one devoted to TV's own oddities
and obscurities. Even TV Land, bless its backward-looking heart, has
grown less adventurous with age and prosperity. It has inevitably
become something like the classic rock stations that play "Stairway
to Heaven" two or three times a day.</LD>
<LD>   What I really long for is a cable channel where any oddball old
show could pop up, where economic pressures are nil, where wild
dreams come true. I want a TV Heaven.</LD>
<TE>   Here, just to stimulate your nostalgia muscles and demonstrate the
amazing array of largely untapped possibilities in the last 50 years
of TV, is a list of series or genres that would reside in this
sofa-spud's own private Idaho: premature-cancellation victims, lost
classics, certified bizarros. Starting way, way back and working
forward, the list:</TE>
<TE>   1950s TV Noir: With FX's "The Shield" and HBO's "The Wire," the
push toward more ambiguous and brutal crime series has never been
stronger. But the darkening mood is nothing new. Detective series
that aspired to the nihilistic tone and ominous lighting of 1940s
film noir were all the rage on TV in the late 1950s and early '60s.
Wouldn't it be cool to see some groupings of episodes of hard-boiled
series such as "Peter Gunn," Lee Marvin's "M Squad," John Cassavetes'
"Johnny Staccato" and the first, best "Mike Hammer," with Darren
McGavin?</TE>
<TE>   "Klondike"/"Acapulco" (1961-62): One episode of each of these two
shows, which still represent the strangest make-over in TV history,
would be nice. Starring James Coburn and Ralph Taeger, it began as an
adventure show set during the Alaskan gold rush of 1898. When
"Klondike" didn't click, NBC at midseason moved the time ahead 60
years, shifted the setting to Mexico and made Coburn and Taeger beach
bums in the Mexican coastal resort. "Acapulco" didn't catch on,
either, but wouldn't it be fun to see the "pilots" back to back?</TE>
<TE>   "The Richard Boone Show" (1963-64): Does "24" have the most daring
premise in series TV history? Nah. At best, it ties Boone's bold
dramatic anthology. After consecutive hits with "Medic" and "Have
Gun, Will Travel," he was such a hot property that NBC was willing to
let him do anything to get him back. Boone's great, doomed notion was
a standing repertory company: the same actors performing different
parts and a different scenario each week. Some superb character
actors, among them Robert Blake, Jeanette Nolan, Bethel Leslie and
Harry Morgan, signed on. Their single season's worth of shows surely
includes some gems.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pruitts of Southampton" (1966-67): No classic is this
one-season wonder, but mightn't it be a hoot to contrast its portrait
of Long Island's East End with that of ABC's recent "reality"
miniseries, "The Hamptons"? And what a cast! Besides Phyllis Diller
playing the matriarch of an old-money family trying to hide its
failing fortunes, regulars and semi-regulars included John Astin,
Paul Lynde and Gypsy Rose Lee.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe and Sons" (1975-76): An early casualty of CBS' 1975 lineup,
this underappreciated comedy starred Richard Castellano as a
single-dad factory worker. Bonus: Jerry Stiller, as Joe's pal,
demonstrating the engaging irascibility that later would serve him so
well in "Seinfeld" and "King of Queens."</TE>
<TE>   "Rags to Riches" (1987-88) and "Cop Rock" (1990): Different as
"Family Affair" and "NYPD Blue" but united by the risk they took:
They were weekly musicals.</TE>
<TE>   "Civil Wars" (1991-93): We shouldn't need a TV Heaven to see this
terrific comedy-drama about divorce lawyers again. It would greatly
enliven Court TV's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Bakersfield P.D." (1993-94): Funny cops in sunny California,
almost as satirically loony as "Police Squad!"</TE>
<TE>   "The Job" (2001-02): Funnier cops in grimy New York. Yes, it's
been less than two months since ABC canceled Denis Leary's prickly
comedy, but it feels like longer.</TE>

<HD>What's a Stadium Without a Team? Foolish</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, someone has had the nerve to call L.A.'s stadium travesty,
whoops, I mean plans, for what they are: a pipe dream. Nicolai
Ouroussoff's commentary on the proposed downtown stadium ("Stadium
Plan for Downtown L.A.: It's Clearly a Fumble," June 10) made clear
one crucial element: The clowns running the show don't know what the
heck they're doing!</LD>
<LD>   For months, I've been suffering in quiet agony over the simple
reality that why on earth should the city lay out major funds for a
stadium when it doesn't even have a football team? Isn't that putting
the cart before the horse? Los Angeles has far more serious issues to
contend with than building a stadium for a team it doesn't even have.</LD>

<HD>'Islamist' Term Is Useful</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While I wholeheartedly agree with the general tack of Howard
Rosenberg's critique of "The Blurred Lines of Today's 'Reality' "
(June 10), his criticism of the use of the word "Islamist" is
misinformed.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than a TV-news neologism, this well-established term among
academic circles and international-affairs experts--dating back at
least to the Iranian revolution of the 1970s--draws a useful
distinction between the various fundamentalist groups on Islam's
periphery and the overwhelming majority of the world's billion-strong
Muslims, whose beliefs on religion and politics are far less extreme
from a modern, Western point of view.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the problem isn't that TV commentators such as Lou Dobbs
recently incorporated this term in their speech. Instead, the problem
lies in the media-fed American public's general ignorance of Islamic
places and peoples, and its consequent inability to see beyond the
simplest of stereotypes.</LD>
<TE>   That one such distinction in the form of the label "Islamist"
should now be entering the vernacular is a much-needed step in the
right direction.</TE>

<LD>In announcing the Ahmanson's "been-there-done-that" season (" '42nd
St.,' Lily Tomlin Set for Ahmanson," by Don Shirley, June 5), Gordon
Davidson suggested that "Urinetown" was better suited to a smaller
theater. And Lily Tomlin's one-person show isn't?</LD>
<LD>   Give that last unannounced slot--although the first show in the
season--to something new, something home-grown, something maybe even
a little risky in an Ahmanson season devoid of risk.</LD>

<LD>I used to watch KCBS news, but I plan to look elsewhere after reading
their duplicitous spin on this decision to narrow viewer choices
("Picking Up Mixed Signals," by Greg Braxton, June 12).</LD>
<LD>   "KCAL-KCBS executives downplayed such concerns, saying the merger
will prove especially beneficial to viewers of KCBS." What would be
even more beneficial would be an improved KCBS that is independent of
and separate from KCAL. Competition serves the viewer's interest far
better than merging.</LD>

<LD>I guess you could say that Scott Schechter and I are kindred spirits
as far as "Judyism" goes ("Judy Garland's 'Day-by-Day' Legacy," by
Susan King, June 10).</LD>
<LD>   I converted to "Judyism" at 12 in 1949 after seeing her film "In
the Good Old Summertime" at a neighborhood theater in Chicago. That
was in the days when you could sit through a movie as many times as
you wanted for one admission, so I stayed to see the film twice. I
remember being so enraptured by her singing of "Play That Barbershop
Chord" and "I Don't Care." In those two numbers there was a vision of
her future concert and TV performances that so captivated and
electrified her audiences--unmatched by any entertainer at any time.</LD>

<HD>Transcendent Chorus in Met's 'Nabucco'</HD>

<LD>If you want to know why "Va, pensiero sull'ali dorate!" (Go, my
thoughts on golden wings) is Italy's unofficial national anthem, tune
into the Metropolitan Opera broadcast of Verdi's "Nabucco" on Sunday
at noon on KCET.</LD>
<LD>   Under the inspired leadership of James Levine, the chorus, sung by
the Hebrew slaves as they think of their homeland during the bitter
captivity in Babylon, reaches sublime heights that transcend national
identities. This point is unintentionally driven home as television
director Brian Large's preference for close-ups pans over the faces
of the multinational singers. They all stay in character even when,
contrary to modern opera practice, Levine repeats the chorus, to the
ecstatic delight of the audience. (The production was taped during
the 2000-01 season.)</LD>
<LD>   There's much more to Verdi's third opera--and first international
blockbuster--than this wonderful moment, of course. For starters,
there's the killer role of Abigaille, the wicked, presumed daughter
of Nabucco (a.k.a. Nebuchadnezzar), who chews up octaves at an
alarming but thrilling rate. She's sung here powerfully by Maria
Guleghina, who also shows the vulnerable side of this monster's
character.</LD>
<TE>   Zaccaria, the High Priest of the Hebrews, is sung and enacted by
Samuel Ramey at his oracular best, even if the voice has lost some of
its sheen and tends to wobble in sustained lines.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy White sings Fenena, Nabucco's real daughter, who converts to
the Hebrew god, with sweetness and conviction. Gwyn Hughes Jones, in
the comparatively small tenor lead role of Ismaele, sings brightly.</TE>
<TE>   The weak link in the chain is Juan Pons in the title role. Far
from having an ideally flexible and rich baritone, Pons pretty much
sings and acts his monochromatic way through the role, which has King
Lear potential. He's best at his moments of introspective repentance.
Nabucco, too, converts.</TE>
<TE>   The Met chorus has other opportunities to shine, and the orchestra
takes flight under Levine's vigorous, lyrical conducting.</TE>
<TE>   The Met's turntable stage allows quick scene changes of John
Napier's two-sided faux-stone set, and the four acts transpire with
only one intermission (2 1/2 hours). Elijah Moshinsky created the
production.</TE>

<HD>Bringing Film Noir to a Hard Boil</HD>
<DH>Dames, dupes and their fans gather for a second festival in
Palm Springs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLIFF ROTHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jane Russell talked about her famous cleavage, Rhonda Fleming cringed
about her 1950s potboiler's being corny (it was) and pulp fiction
legend Mickey Spillane held court (as usual). It was 110 degrees in
the shade (literally) while screens were being scorched by scheming
dames, hard-boiled cops and innocent dupes as the Palm Springs Film
Noir Festival unfurled its second season last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   This newest entry in the film noir festival circuit--now numbering
five nationally--is testament, say noir enthusiasts, to the growing
popularity of the genre. (And one that unites the baby boomers who
coined the phrase "film noir" with the older generation who made the
films.</LD>
<LD>   "I hate the word 'genre,' scoffed the hard-boiled Spillane, who
penned "Kiss Me Deadly" 50 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The Palm Springs festival joins a list that includes Los Angeles'
American Cinematheque film noir series, in its fourth year; Santa
Fe's Summer in the Dark Festival, in its fifth year; New York's Film
Forum series, which began in the 1980s; and the granddaddy of them
all, the Seattle Art Museum's annual film noir series, which is
marking its 25th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   The term "film noir," French in origin and meaning "dark film,"
pertains to films made between, roughly, the mid-1940s and mid-1950s,
set mostly at night, with dark shadows, dark motives and, often,
murder. They're populated by femmes fatales, guileless men who are
snared in their webs and gumshoes. It's "a world that is humorless,
merciless, unforgiving," says Palm Springs festival co-director and
contemporary noir author Art Lyons.</TE>
<TE>   The great dames of noir films who are still alive and kicking,
including Russell and Ann Savage, were happy to go to Palm Springs
for another ride around the block, as Billy Wilder wrote for an
exchange between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in "Double
Indemnity," one of the most famous bits of noir dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   For the generation who made the films, the work wasn't film noir,
it was just another picture; it was a gig, not a genre.</TE>
<TE>   "What's film noir? You tell me what film noir is," actress Beverly
Garland said, laughing, at the opening night bash at the Deck, a
restaurant overlooking Palm Springs' main drag, Palm Canyon Drive.
Garland, looking swell in a black pantsuit and a short blond cut,
starred in "D.O.A.," a 1950 black-and-white mystery with a poisoned
Edmond O'Brien searching for his killer.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, who starred in noir potboilers for RKO, many of them with
sneering costar Robert Mitchum, also couldn't come up with a tag.
Savage, who starred in what was possibly the lowest-budget B-grade
film noir of them all, "Detour," came closest: "filled with downers,
out of luck." Savage reports she's still in demand because of the
popularity of "Detour," made in 1945 and shown at the festival this
week. "I have five or six interviews coming up. And one is on the
table that I haven't gotten back to," says the actress, 81.</TE>
<TE>   Film noir's heyday ended nearly half a century ago, and the mean
age of the stars tops 75. Many of the films are difficult to find.
The genre was largely based on crime, mystery or pulp fiction, the
lowest pecking order on the Hollywood grid of the golden age, when
women's pictures, musicals and prestige dramas ruled. Noir films were
often low-budget independents, especially into the '50s. Rights are
murky, and the films have not been preserved and are disintegrating
or lost.</TE>
<TE>   The festival's opening film was the rarely seen 1950 "His Kind of
Woman," with Mitchum and Russell snarling and leering their way
through the elaborately scripted mystery. "That doesn't exist on film
anymore," says Lyons. "We went to Swank [Motion Pictures Inc.] first,
who has the rights, but they didn't have the film. We traced the film
to Warners, who listed it as being in their vaults at the UCLA
Archives in 16-millimeter. They ran it and it disintegrated. So we
had to splice together three videos to run it."</TE>
<TE>   Spillane, decked out in a sports coat and porkpie hat, arrived
opening night in a vintage 1920s car at the Camelot Theatre, the
city's largest film auditorium. The 550 seats were sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Spillane, who played his own character, Mike Hammer, in the 1963
"The Girl Hunters," hasn't lost his moxie, as they used to say. Palm
Springs Life wanted to feature him on its cover flanked by some of
the famous noir actresses. Spillane balked. "He didn't want to be
seen with older women," says Craig Prater, the festival's
co-director. Instead, the June issue features Spillane, 84,
surrounded by a bevy of twentysomethings.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming, a major philanthropist, could not be more different from
her vamp screen persona. Sweet and demure, she was on the money about
"Slightly Scarlet," a potboiler directed by Allan Dwan. "It's corny,
isn't it? I haven't seen it in years," she told noir expert and
author Eddie Muller during the question-answer session that followed
the film last week. "I didn't know it was a comedy," she joked.</TE>
<TE>   The audience was older than those at the other noir festivals,
reflecting the town's demographics. They were fans rather than
aficionados. "Crowds in Los Angeles are extremely film savvy. I
sometimes get the impression of 40 people sitting there in the front
row who know just as much as I do," said Muller. "What's refreshing
here is that people come to see a story and be entertained. They're
not studying the lines on the film and the grains of the print. They
just want to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   "I live for this kind of stuff!" exclaimed an exuberant Viga Dean,
a personal assistant decked out for the opening night in a Patti Page
black and lace crinoline dress and cocktail hat with veil.</TE>
<TE>   Factory owner Fred Lynch drove in from Phoenix, because noir films
"are better in the theater," he said. "A lot of good directors worked
in the genre on their way to becoming important directors, like
Nicholas Ray and Anthony Mann."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Stanley works in a San Francisco mystery bookstore, and for
her the draw was Spillane: "He's the granddaddy of all mystery
writers."</TE>
<TE>   Looking around the theater, Fleming noted, "It's not that long ago
that film noir didn't mean much. Now it's a hot ticket."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the festival lost money. Lyons, who financed the
festival, was clearly happy as the festival closed. "After last year,
I said there'd be no festival again if we lost money this year." And?
"We made money," he said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   He's already plotting a smoldering Ann Sheridan lighting up the
Camelot Theatre next year in "Nora Prentiss." Then adds: "But god
knows if we're going to get it."</TE>

<HD>A Razor-Sharp Staging of 'Sweeney Todd'</HD>
<DH>Brian Stokes Mitchell makes the role of the demon barber
his own in a Kennedy Center revival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Brian Stokes Mitchell became famous among Los Angeles
musical theater audiences for playing a character who is so
distraught over the loss of the woman he loved that he takes drastic
action against those forces in society that he believes were
responsible for her death. We're talking about his mesmerizing
Coalhouse Walker in "Ragtime." Coalhouse, move over. Mitchell is now
playing another man who fits the above description: the title
character in "Sweeney Todd."</LD>
<LD>   And a sensational Sweeney he is.</LD>
<LD>   Word of his performance has spread. Members of the audience at the
Kennedy Center's Sondheim Celebration begin applauding at the first
sight of Mitchell, paying homage to the star and lessening the impact
of the character's chilling entrance. Still, with his wrathful eyes
gleaming, his masterful baritone at full throttle, his lithe and lean
frame stiffened into the posture of a man on the edge of a precipice,
Mitchell evokes one thrilling moment after another. In his
frustration over his botched first attempt to take his revenge, he
directly addresses the audience, as if he might break the fourth wall
and start hacking away with his faithful razor in the expensive
seats.</LD>
<TE>   When he isn't frightening the daylights out of everyone, his
ungainly laugh in "A Little Priest" is equally unforgettable. So is
his deadpan stare when his jolly compatriot in crime, Mrs. Lovett,
suggests marriage. Those who don't get to see him at the Kennedy
Center can console themselves with the assurance that it's almost
inconceivable that this performance will end in Washington. Surely
someone will hire Mitchell to play Sweeney in a commercial
revival--which would appear overdue, considering the increasing and
justifiable reverence accorded to the great Sondheim score and to
Hugh Wheeler's libretto, based on Christopher Bond's adaptation of
the Victorian tale of "the demon barber of Fleet Street."</TE>
<TE>   Commercial producers might well want to bring back Christine
Baranski too as Mrs. Lovett. Some lucky Angelenos already saw her in
a brief Reprise! production of "Sweeney Todd" at the Ahmanson in
1999, but she has polished every nuance by now. Her scrappy attempts
to create a happier life with her psychopathic lover are hilarious
and touching. Christopher Ashley's staging also benefits from another
veteran of the Reprise! production, musical director Larry Blank, who
honors the textures of Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations with the
25-piece Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra, despite an
occasionally overamplified sound design (with some awkward pops and
squawks at the performance I saw) by Tom Morse.</TE>
<TE>   The cast includes a current L.A. stage favorite, Hugh Panaro, as
the sailor Anthony Hope, wrapping his carefully enunciated tenor
around "Johanna." Walter Charles is excellent as the dastardly Judge
Turpin, who gets a full-blown version of the self-flagellation scene
that's sometimes left out of local productions. Derek McLane's set is
full of exposed pipes and scaffolding for that early Industrial
Revolution look, intensified by the haze of Howell Binkley's
lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley takes advantage of the depth of the Kennedy Center's
Eisenhower Theater to stage some long, moody entrances from the rear
that provide visual contrast to the literally slashing movement and
the hustle-bustle of the crowd at the forefront.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Truly Operatic</HD>
<DH>Since Domingo took over in L.A., there have been few dull
moments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the final performances of "Duke Bluebeard's Castle" and "Gianni
Schicchi" this afternoon and "Turandot" Sunday afternoon, Los Angeles
Opera ends what may have been its most unpredictable season since the
first one, a decade and half ago. And, by all reports, the most
chaotic.</LD>
<LD>   As the initial season planned by Placido Domingo, who became the
artistic director in 2000, how could it have been otherwise? Domingo
is probably the most restless figure in the history of opera,
juggling careers as opera star, pop singer, conductor and the
artistic director of not one but two opera companies (Washington
Opera along with L.A. Opera). Although he's 61, his voice remains in
remarkable shape, and he shows no sign of slowing down.</LD>
<LD>   Inevitably, there are grumbles that Domingo spreads himself too
thin. But that's part of the persona; it helps connect the singular
Domingo with the wide world.</LD>
<TE>   And, having proved that he can have it all, he wants the same for
Los Angeles Opera. He appears perfectly willing to use his power,
glamour and charm to get as much as he can for us.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, we now have a company with great ambition that runs
by the seat of its pants. That's a recipe for driving the board of
directors to distraction, but it's not necessarily a bad thing for
the rest of us. That Domingo is all over the place--artistically as
well as physically--means that at least some of those places are
bound to be fascinating, exotic and controversial.</TE>
<TE>   The most radical departure that Los Angeles Opera took this season
was Achim Freyer's abstract staging of Bach's Mass in B Minor, which
divided the audience into those who found it stimulating, those who
simply didn't see the point and those who were offended by the very
notion of illustrating Bach's sacred masterpiece with unrelated stage
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Domingo admitted in a news conference that the Mass was a gamble
and that there had been pressure on him to cancel its February run,
what with the board fretting about depressed ticket sales after Sept.
11. But he held firm, and he says that the company sold more tickets
than projected for the six performances, proving that Los Angeles has
an audience for venturesome music theater.</TE>
<TE>   The most productive example of Domingo's persistence and
persuasiveness was his ability to get the normally cautious Kent
Nagano, after nearly a year of hesitation, to commit to becoming L.A.
Opera's first principal conductor. No single performer, not even
Domingo, means more to the company.</TE>
<TE>   With Nagano in the pit--as he was for Wagner's "Tannhauser" in
September and as he is for the operas being performed this
weekend--productions take on a kind of glow. The orchestra,
traditionally a weak point, is transformed, the aural equivalent of
going from wan black and white to sparkling Technicolor. When
everything works well, as it does in William Friedkin's uproarious
production of Puccini's comedy "Gianni Schicchi," Nagano demonstrates
that L.A. Opera can rise to a level of theatrical vibrancy and sonic
sophistication that was almost unthinkable a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   When things don't work well, Nagano is equally valuable. Take
Tuesday night's performance of "Turandot." It was the second and
final performance from the second cast, and the leading tenor and
soprano were woefully inadequate. The production by Giancarlo del
Monaco has a few nice touches (especially the use of the chorus in
the crowd scenes), but it has been a problem for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Reportedly, the director was disliked by the performers; he did
not take the traditional curtain call on the first night. The company
will not say whether he will be back to direct next season's opener,
Puccini's "The Girl of the Golden West," as planned, but the welcome
mat is not out.</TE>
<TE>   Nagano saved the day Tuesday by maintaining an overall musical
elegance behind Puccini's raw spectacle and by guiding the vocally
distressed principals with tender care. He made the new ending by
Luciano Berio sound even more compelling than he had at the opening 2
1/2 weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Tuesday night also indicated the kind of slapdash planning
that marks the Domingo regime. One wonders what he could have been
thinking when he chose to bring this production to Los Angeles,
especially given that the Metropolitan Opera had already become
disillusioned with the temperamental director.</TE>
<TE>   Did no one measure the sets? Those sitting in the balcony couldn't
see the Emperor seated at the top of a high staircase; and many
downstairs couldn't see around pillars that were part of the stage
design. Tuesday's disappointing tenor, Ian DeNolfo, was hardly
unknown to Domingo; he has been regularly engaged by Washington
Opera.</TE>
<TE>   Under the last years of Peter Hemmings' tightly run regime, high
points and low points at L.A. Opera were uncommon. Instead, the
company was on a kind of boring even keel. Now the ship lists
dramatically. In the fall, Domingo's coequal, executive director Ian
White-Thomson, responsible for the company's finances, summarily
resigned. He was not replaced. Instead, the company created a new
post, a director of administration who reports to Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect anything to settle down soon. Not only is there a
problem with the director for "The Girl of the Golden West," but the
company also lacks a full cast and a production team for Mozart's
"Don Giovanni," at the close of the season. Given that prominent
singers and directors book years in advance, this could become a
crisis. It's all the more complicated because the company would like
the same director to mount two more Mozart operas, "The Marriage of
Figaro" and "Cosi fan Tutti," in future seasons.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, insane as such last-minute planning can be, it
also frees the company to pounce on young talent whenever Domingo
discovers it, rather than waiting years, as most major, long-booked
companies must.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Opera's biggest challenge for next season, though, will be
Prokofiev's mammoth "War and Peace," conducted by Valery Gergiev and
featuring a cast drawn from his Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg. This
production of the grandest Russian opera of them all was given at the
Met earlier this year, and it was an ordeal even for that
well-organized company, which has far greater resources than Los
Angeles Opera.</TE>
<TE>   Who exactly will populate the cast of hundreds? Will Gergiev, who
is at least as hard to pin down as Domingo, be in town long enough to
prepare it? He was here only a week to rehearse "The Queen of
Spades," which opened this season. This is tightrope programming: A
lot of nails will be bitten down to raw skin.</TE>
<TE>   Already L.A. Opera has backed down on another anticipated
highlight of next year's season, the premiere of a new version of
"The Coronation of Poppea," with an orchestration commissioned from
Berio. Rather than a world premiere staging, Monteverdi's opera will
now be presented in concert. Domingo explained that because Berio was
in an automobile accident last summer, this chance-taking regime was
taking no chances. But by all reports, Berio is recovered. The real
concern may be Berio's reputation for missing deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Undoubtedly, it was also a money-saving business decision;
"Poppea" isn't likely to be a strong box-office draw. With a
multimillion-dollar "Ring" looming for 2006, it is hardly surprising
to encounter penny-pinching elsewhere. I hope, however, that it is
not a new lack of nerve on the company's part.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, chaos and exuberance go hand in hand at Domingo's L.A.
Opera; lose one, and the other is threatened. But disorganization
demands dollars, lots of them; everything costs more at the last
minute.</TE>
<TE>   As long as Domingo keeps on getting those dollars, he has proved
more than willing to spend them in ways that make this former
operatic desert a place where the art form blooms. L.A. Opera has
become a place where just about anything can happen.</TE>

<HD>Jury Order Deals a Blow to Andersen</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge rules panel can reach a guilty verdict even
if members don't agree on which executive broke the law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>In a pivotal decision, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled
Friday that jurors could convict Arthur Andersen of obstruction of
justice even if they disagree on which of the firm's executives
violated the law.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling--which had been sought by prosecutors--could allow
jurors to break their deadlock in the six-week trial of the
accounting firm. Harmon acknowledged struggling to reach the
decision, saying the lack of case law in the area put her in the
"terrifying" position of ruling in uncharted legal territory.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly afterward, Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin asked
Harmon to declare a mistrial, saying the new instruction, coupled
with the length of the jury deliberations, could be seen as coercing
jurors to reach a verdict. Harmon denied the motion.</LD>
<TE>   After receiving Harmon's decision, the jurors deliberated for
about 45 minutes without reaching a verdict and returned to a hotel
where they have been sequestered since last week. The panel of nine
men and three women is to begin its 10th day of deliberations today.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is charged with destroying Enron Corp.-related documents
with the intent of undermining a Securities and Exchange Commission
inquiry of the failing energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   To convict the firm, prosecutors have to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that one or more Andersen executives "corruptly persuaded"
someone to withhold or destroy records in order to keep them away
from the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors had asked, in a note to the judge Thursday, whether they
had to agree on which executive may have acted corruptly. Prosecutors
praised the ruling, but Andersen attorneys contended that jurors must
unanimously agree on which person had corrupt intent.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the ruling "utterly unsupportable," Andersen lawyer
Charles Rothfeld said the judge delivered a significant new
instruction to a jury that had already declared an impasse. That, he
said, amounts to coercing the jury toward a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor, called the
decision the "worst news for defense counsel."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if there is a conviction, it will be a major point for
appeal," she said. "But it doesn't mean [the judge] was wrong. It's
just a cutting-edge issue. The court of appeals will get the last
word on it."</TE>
<TE>   Harmon's decision came several hours after the two sides made
last-ditch arguments over their interpretations of relevant
precedents.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen attorney Denis McInerney said federal courts have held
that juries can reach a verdict without agreeing on certain facts
only when those facts are "peripheral or trivial." In contrast, he
said, the question of which executive had criminal intent is "the
most important aspect of our trial."</TE>
<TE>   McInerney said Hardin's closing argument--which focused on
refuting the idea that either Enron audit team leader David B. Duncan
or Andersen staff counsel Nancy Temple had criminal intent--would
have been "radically different" if Andersen believed the court would
instruct jurors that they didn't have to identify a specific
executive.</TE>
<TE>   But Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Weissmann said that if juries
always had to agree on which individual within a corporation
committed an offense, "the loophole [in] corporate criminal liability
... is gaping."</TE>
<TE>   Weissmann also told Harmon that "if there is any sort of default
position" on how to decide the issue, it should favor the Justice
Department because "we don't get a right to appeal" but the defense
does.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the arguments and case law in chambers, Harmon
emerged to say "not one of the cases is directly on point." She told
those in the courtroom that "if someone knows of a case ... I would
really urge you to give me the [citation] right now so I don't make a
mistake and rule incorrectly."</TE>
<TE>   After Harmon announced her decision, Andersen attorneys asked the
judge to order the jury to fill out a special verdict form if they
reach a decision, in which jurors would have to say whether they
agreed unanimously on which executives violated the law and also
identify the executives.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon said she did not believe it was necessary to poll the panel
but indicated that she might be open to other specialized questions.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen counsel also asked Harmon to reopen closing arguments.
The judge denied the request.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawyers said the ruling was potentially troubling for other
corporations and partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "In essence, each juror can disagree as to what the other 11
believe about a given employee," said Tom Holliday, a partner and
criminal defense lawyer for Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher in Los Angeles.
"But if each juror has their own culpable employee, the instruction
would appear to lead to a verdict. And that strikes me as unfair and
maybe unconstitutional."</TE>
<TE>   Harmon's ruling on the jury's question was the second blow for
Andersen in a dispute over the way the jurors were instructed.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Hardin objected to the special instruction
known as an Allen charge that Harmon gave jurors after they declared
a deadlock on Wednesday, asking the panel to renew efforts to reach a
verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Although the instructions were taken almost verbatim from a model
charge used within the federal circuit, Andersen's lawyers opposed
Harmon's decision to cut a line that reminds jurors they should
return a not-guilty verdict "if the evidence in the case fails to
establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."</TE>

<HD>Unemployment Rate in California Dips to 6.3% in May but
Payrolls Fall</HD>
<DH>Labor: Many firms hold off hiring over economic concerns.
Joblessness may rise during summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's unemployment rate dipped to 6.3% in May, providing
further evidence that the state's economy is on the mend.</LD>
<LD>   That's down from a revised 6.5% in April and better than some
analysts had expected.</LD>
<LD>   But the number of workers on business payrolls--the most reliable
measure of the labor market's health--declined by 9,000 jobs last
month, a sign that job hunters aren't feeling the recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Under pressure to improve profitability and unsure of the
economy's pep, many companies aren't hiring. The result is a recovery
in the Golden State that is lacking job creation.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first five months of the year, California has added
2,500 net new jobs, leaving the state with 51,000 fewer payroll
positions than it had a year ago and nearly 71,000 fewer than the
pre-recession peak of January 2001. California's unemployment rate
improved last month partly because some discouraged workers dropped
out of the labor force and thus are no longer counted in the jobless
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to be the first to go out and hire if competitors
aren't doing it," said Tom Lieser, senior economist with the UCLA
Anderson Forecast.</TE>
<TE>   The state's unemployment rate could increase in coming months as
students looking for summer employment swell the ranks of job seekers
competing for work in a sluggish labor market, Lieser said. The good
news, he and others said, is that California's employment picture
appears to have stabilized. Steep losses in the Bay Area's tech
sector are leveling off, while Southern California's diverse economy
continues to create new jobs, albeit at a much slower pace than
during the height of the economic boom.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on a path that's sustainable," said Mark Schniepp, director
of the California Economic Forecast Project in Santa Barbara. "The
real news is that things aren't getting worse."</TE>
<TE>   The May drop in California's unemployment rate mimicked that of
the nation, which dipped to 5.8% in May from 6% in April. A year ago,
the nation's unemployment rate stood at 4.4%, while California's was
5.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California continues to post some of the lowest
unemployment rates in the state. Orange County's jobless rate fell to
3.6% in May, down from 3.8% in April. San Diego County showed a
similar decline, to 3.7% from 3.9% in April. The Inland Empire saw
unemployment in Riverside and San Bernardino counties slide to 5.1%
in May from 5.3% the month before, and Ventura County's rate declined
to 4.2% from 4.5%. Unemployment in Los Angeles County remained well
above the state average, dipping to 6.8% in May from a revised 6.9%
in April.</TE>
<TE>   Still, L.A. County led the pack in job creation, adding 8,800 jobs
last month. The six Southern California counties combined saw nonfarm
payroll employment increase by nearly 21,000 in May.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, only two industries--services and government--managed
to add jobs during the month. But that 9,600 job gain was more than
offset by 18,600 job losses in construction, manufacturing,
transportation and public utilities, wholesale and retail trade, and
finance, insurance and real estate. Construction posted the largest
decline, down 9,600 jobs, reflecting a drop-off in commercial and
industrial construction, said Esmael Adibi, director of the Anderson
Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "Vacancy rates are up," particularly in office markets such as San
Francisco, Adibi said. "That's why we're seeing a slowdown of
building activity in that sector."</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing posted its 15th straight decline with a loss of
5,000 jobs in May.</TE>
<TE>   But the pace of the losses has slowed substantially from last
year, and experts said the worst is over. Government figures released
Friday show that industrial production rose 0.2% in May, its fifth
consecutive monthly increase. In what could be a hopeful sign for
Northern California's tech industry, computer output rose 0.6% in
May, while semiconductor production jumped 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   It's "an excellent sign that business investment is beginning to
pick up," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, signs are emerging that consumers, whose strong
spending has kept the downturn relatively mild, are beginning to lose
optimism.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's preliminary June consumer sentiment
index, released Friday, took its biggest tumble since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. Likewise, government figures released earlier this
week showed retail sales declining an unexpectedly large 0.9% in May.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts expect consumer demand to stabilize, helping
the manufacturing sector to pick up momentum as the recovery rolls
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers clearly are in the process of hibernation, pausing
after a very robust pace of spending," economist Sohn said. "It is a
soft patch which will not last. We will get back onto firm ground
once we get through the second quarter."</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate for California's Latinos declined to 7.4% in
May from 7.5% in April, while that of blacks rose to 10.3% from
10.1%. Whites held stable at 5.6%.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo County posted the lowest unemployment rate of all
California counties at 2.6% in May, while Imperial County recorded
the highest at 16.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Energy Firms Comply With U.S. Order</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Four traders submit new filings to FERC to
prove they have behaved properly in Western markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four energy companies that were threatened with the loss of wholesale
power-trading privileges said Friday that they had submitted more
information to federal regulators to prove they have behaved properly
in Western markets.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on June 4 accused Avista
Corp., El Paso Electric Co., Portland General Electric Co. and
Williams Cos. of withholding information from FERC's investigation
into abuses in California's energy markets. The companies were given
until Friday to respond or risk losing their ability to charge market
prices.</LD>
<LD>   FERC gave no indication whether officials were satisfied with the
new filings. FERC said June 4 that other traders might receive
similar orders.</LD>
<TE>   Williams, of Tulsa, Okla., made no formal filing Friday, but a
spokeswoman noted that the company had opened its trading books to
FERC on Wednesday and that commission investigators remained there.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is seen as having the most at stake because it is an
active trader, whereas the three others are utilities with trading
operations. If a company loses its ability to charge market rates, it
must sell its power at the cost of production plus a reasonable
return, rather than a price determined by a competitive market.</TE>
<TE>   Avista, of Spokane, Wash.; El Paso Electric, serving parts of
Texas and New Mexico; and Portland General, an Oregon utility owned
by Enron Corp., all said they submitted extensive new material to
FERC. All said they operated within market rules.</TE>

<HD>Another Down Week for Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Pakistan car bombing and waning U.S. consumer
sentiment prolong the slide in the major indexes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks snapped back from an early plunge to finish mixed Friday, but
major U.S. indexes still ended lower for a fourth straight week as a
car bombing in Pakistan and another round of bad news about the
economy and corporate earnings rattled investors and kept a lid on
the day's gains.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average recovered from an early 241-point
drop to close down 28.59 points, or 0.3%, at 9,474.21, and the
broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 2.29 points, or 0.2%, to
1,007.27.</LD>
<LD>   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 7.88 points,
or 0.5%, to 1,504.74, as bargain hunters swooped in. Early on, the
index was down 51 points.</LD>
<TE>   Losers edged winners by 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange;
advancing and declining shares were about even on Nasdaq. Trading was
heavy.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow slid 1.2%, the S&amp;P 500 fell 2% and Nasdaq
lost 2%. In four weeks the indexes have sunk 8.5%, 9% and 13.6%,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a steady rainstorm of bad news, and the rain has gotten
heavier in the past six to eight weeks," said Dennis Ferro, chief
investment officer at Evergreen Investments in Charlotte, N.C.
"Between earnings, quality of earnings and corporate governance
issues, there's not a huge amount of sunshine out there."</TE>
<TE>   Indexes plummeted in the morning after a bombing outside a U.S.
government office in Pakistan left 11 dead and many others injured,
prompting fears of further terrorist strikes.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's index of U.S. consumer sentiment in
early June provided an economic jolt, as the reading showed a
surprisingly steep drop from the month before.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Sprint cut its sales forecast and brokerage analysts
raced to downgrade the wireless phone sector.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are near their Sept. 21 lows of 965.80 and
1,423.19, respectively, reached in the wake of the terrorist attacks.
At its low point Friday, the S&amp;P 500--the market's primary
benchmark--was within 16 points of its Sept 21 close.</TE>
<TE>   Still, at least one analyst is hopeful that the market's recent
troubles are ending and that the major indexes won't fall
meaningfully below their September lows.</TE>
<TE>   "The market would need more bad news geopolitically or
economically to break through those lows, and I don't see that as a
high likelihood," said John Forelli, portfolio manager at
Independence Investments in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Could Friday's late advance set the stage for a market recovery?
Analysts are dubious, saying the market could be stuck in a modest
"trading range" until the earnings picture comes into better focus.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a reasonable set of second-quarter earnings numbers and
the economic indicators look good, that could set the stage for a
summer rally," said Ferro of Evergreen Investments.</TE>
<TE>   One challenge in trying to pinpoint the market's nadir is that
"there's no unanimity to this market," said Paul Rabbitt, head of
Rabbitt Analytics in Hermosa Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the Dow, which has a relatively low weighting of
tech stocks, and the Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks have held
up better and remain further from their September lows.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar, meanwhile, fell to a 17-month low against the euro,
while bond yields fell on the weak economic news. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note slid from 4.90% on Thursday to
4.80%--its lowest since Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * On Nasdaq, hard-hit ImClone Systems was among the day's big
gainers, along with software leader Microsoft and biotech giant
Amgen. ImClone gained 71 cents to $8.79, Microsoft advanced $1.03 to
$55.25--once again passing General Electric as the biggest U.S.
company by market value--and Amgen rose $2.38 to $40.18, part of a
broad biotech rally.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex, which Amgen is acquiring, surged 94 cents to $21.72 on a
strong progress report for its arthritis drug Enbrel.</TE>
<TE>   * Among blue-chip names, Home Depot fell 92 cents to $36.98 as
traders reacted to the consumer confidence report, but American
International Group gained $1.62 to $64.46 after a Lehman Bros.
analyst called the insurance giant a "compelling" bargain.</TE>
<TE>   * TRW, facing a takeover bid by Northrop Grumman, fell 52 cents to
$54.38 after saying it expects profit to exceed Wall Street's
estimates this year because of rising sales in its automotive unit.
Northrop was off $1.17 to $122.13.</TE>
<TE>   * Stocks finished sharply lower in Europe, where most markets
closed before the rebound in the U.S. Among major bourses, Germany
fell 3.7%, Britain was down 3% and France was off 2.9%.</TE>

<HD>Got Meat? Supermarkets Say Yes</HD>
<DH>Food: A surplus of chicken and beef has been a boon for
consumers as prices keep dropping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Noticed lower prices on steaks, chops and chicken lately? Thank
Russia for it.</LD>
<LD>   After blocking all shipments of U.S. poultry earlier this spring,
the U.S.' best customer for chicken has since only allowed a trickle
of goods back in. That has thrown hundreds of thousands of tons of
drumsticks back on the American market, sending poultry prices
plummeting.</LD>
<LD>   Those chicken discounts, coupled with dampened demand for a record
level of beef and other meat being produced in the still-fragile U.S.
economy, has created an American meat glut that could last through
the summer, analysts say. A Mexican ban on American poultry,
announced earlier this week, could only worsen the situation, they
say.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be a bonanza for consumers" this summer, said Steve
Kay, publisher of Cattle Buyers Weekly in Petaluma, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Retail prices for chicken, beef and pork already had edged down in
the first part of the second quarter. Ground chuck fell 26 cents on
average to $1.91 a pound, sirloin tip roast fell 12 cents to $2.78 a
pound, and whole fryers dipped 6 cents to $1.01 a pound, according to
a market basket survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation.</TE>
<TE>   But those modest price cuts, analysts say, barely reflect the huge
price drops producers have endured in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Smithfield Foods Inc., the world's largest hog producer and pork
processor, said last week that profit in its last quarter fell by
more than half, thanks to the lingering effects of the poultry spat
with Russia, which many see as retaliation for President Bush's ban
on Russian steel imports.</TE>
<TE>   With wholesale prices dropping almost weekly, the Department of
Agriculture said Friday that it expected livestock sales to decline
to $99.4 billion this year, from $106.4 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Although it might seem odd that a country such as Russia could
have such huge sway on the American meat market, consider this:
Russia buys about 8% of U.S. chicken, more by volume than all the
beef the U.S. exports to the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Until more of this cheap chicken is taken off the market, the
nation will continue to be awash in meat.</TE>
<TE>   That is, analysts say, unless droughts in Colorado and elsewhere
affect cattle production. Or if exports to Japan pick up again, as
consumers there regain their appetite for beef after last year's
scare over "mad cow" disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have not picked up the high end of our beef exports
[there]," said market analyst and former cattle feeder Andrew
Gottschalk, of Colorado-based R.J. O'Brian &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Some ranchers tried to hold on to their cattle and continue
feeding them until prices picked up again. That strategy backfired.
Although it may have reduced the number of cows coming to slaughter
at any given time, those brought in recently were chunky--24 pounds
heavier than last year, enough to keep prices low.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers and ranchers complain that U.S. supermarkets have done
little to ease the glut, offering modest discounts when they could be
rolling back prices significantly.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Albertson's Inc. say the chain does not slash
prices, just as it does not raise prices substantially when wholesale
meat prices go up.</TE>
<TE>   "Our retail prices don't usually change that much. We absorb small
increases and don't change prices for small decreases," spokeswoman
Karen Ramos said.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesale prices for frozen leg quarters, the cut typically bound
for Russia, have been slashed in half from those a year ago, to about
20 cents a pound, said Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council.</TE>
<TE>   Beef ribs, the source of rib eyes and prime rib, have dropped
16.8% on the wholesale market in the last year, to $1.78 a pound,
Gottschalk said.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly a year of break-even prices or losses, beef producers
are just now beginning to pare booming production, a fact that should
aid prices this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "People are just kind of hanging on," said John Harris,
California's largest cattle feeder, who also runs his own Central
Valley meatpacking operation. "You lose money some years [in
ranching] and this is one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Chicken producers, meanwhile, are lobbying to ease the sanctions
on their products both in Mexico, which has blocked imports from
seven U.S. states on fears of avian influenza, and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   A technical team of Russian agriculture officials met with USDA
officials in Washington this week to hash out their concerns about
sanitary conditions at U.S. plants. And Agriculture Secretary Ann M.
Veneman said she has been discussing the matter with Russian
Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to talk about the broader relationship [with Russia] in
addition to how we move forward to get this chicken issue resolved as
quickly as possible so that we can continue to have access to that
very important market," Veneman said this week at the World Food
Summit in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russia's poultry ban was lifted in April, U.S. producers
have had a hard time getting new permits to ship into Russia. And
some product has been detained.</TE>
<TE>   In the six weeks since the ban was lifted, about 10,000 tons have
made it to the Russian market, less than a tenth of what was shipped
during the same time last year, said Lobb of the National Chicken
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Russian companies are afraid to even exercise the permits [to
import]," he said, because they fear product will sit in cold storage
at the port for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Lobb said he believes the poultry spat ultimately will be resolved
through new tariffs on U.S. poultry that could be enacted next year.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of this year, however, he expects to be a tough one for
the poultry industry and the rest of the meat business. And pork
producers are expecting near-record production in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have the freezer capacity," Lobb said, "this is the time
to stock up."</TE>

<HD>AOL Selling Songs Online in Unprotected Format</HD>
<DH>Music: The company is offering 99-cent MP3 singles from new
and established acts as part of a 90-day experiment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet powerhouse America Online has quietly begun selling
downloadable songs, offering exclusive singles from corporate sibling
Warner Music Group at a low price and without electronic locks.</LD>
<LD>   The 90-day experiment by the AOL Time Warner Inc. unit, which
began June 1, features MP3 files--a freely copyable format favored by
consumers but spurned by the major labels. The 99-cent singles come
from new artists and established acts, including the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Alanis Morissette and Brandy.</LD>
<LD>   The MP3s are another example of the music industry tiptoeing away
from highly secure formats designed to deter piracy--although not
necessarily forever. Consumers have been cool to the labels'
encrypted songs, preferring digital files that can easily be copied,
played on portable devices and burned onto CDs.</LD>
<TE>   Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment recently decided to allow
its copy-protected downloads to be recorded onto CDs with no
scrambling. And Universal Music Group, a subsidiary of Vivendi
Universal, plans to make tens of thousands of songs available this
year for downloading in a secure format that allows CD burning.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, record companies continue to experiment with
technologies that limit but don't eliminate copying, seeking to give
consumers the flexibility they want without enabling songs to be
duplicated freely over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "If a major label is selling music in unprotected MP3 files, this
has to be only an experimental phase," said analyst P.J. McNealy of
GartnerG2, a technology research firm. "There is no way that you'd
find all of the labels permanently selling all of the catalog in MP3
files."</TE>
<TE>   Ann Burkhart, a spokeswoman for AOL Music, said the company chose
MP3 because it is a standard format that makes buying and listening
to music easy and convenient for consumers. AOL will include the
charges for downloaded songs in its monthly bills, so members won't
have to pay for them immediately--a feature expected to boost sales.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Music has been experimenting with 99-cent downloads for
some time, spokesman Will Tanous said, and more experiments are
forthcoming as the company studies the online music market.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to refine our offerings in an effort to see how
consumers will react to different models and promotions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, McNealy said, AOL's experiment would help
Warner understand whether consumers prefer to download songs or play
them from online jukeboxes, as well as test prices for music files
that are copyable and portable.</TE>
<TE>   "They're moving closer to consumers, but they're not sure how
close they want to get yet," he said.</TE>

<LD>Nabors Industries Inc. shareholders approved a plan to incorporate in
Bermuda to reduce taxes after a federal judge denied a request for a
restraining order to block the vote.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest onshore oil- and gas-well drilling company
said investors holding 83% of the 111.6 million votes cast approved
the move.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based Nabors seeks to join rivals such as GlobalSantaFe
Corp. and Transocean Inc., which incorporated abroad in 1999 to lower
their taxes. Congress is considering measures to block offshore
incorporations or nullify the benefits.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc. said it will pay about $870
million in stock to buy Syncor International Corp., the leading
provider of pharmacy services that uses radioactive compounds to
diagnose and treat ailments.</LD>
<LD>   Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal is buying the business to supplement
its 2001 acquisition of Bindley Western, which has a strong franchise
in nuclear medicine.</LD>
<LD>   The deal's value is based on the 14 million Cardinal shares
offered to Syncor holders at $62.08 apiece on the New York Stock
Exchange on Friday afternoon, after the deal was announced. Each
Syncor common share will be exchanged for 0.52 Cardinal common share,
the companies said.</LD>
<TE>   Cardinal, which closed down 41 cents at $61.94 on the NYSE, said
it will assume about $202 million of debt from Woodland Hills-based
Syncor.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor, whose shares rose $3.24, or more than 11%, to close at
$31.45 on Nasdaq, compounds and dispenses radiopharmaceuticals to
diagnose and treat tumors, heart disease and other ailments.</TE>

<HD>Rockwell Collins to Buy Acterna Unit in Tustin</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rockwell Collins Inc., a maker of instruments for aircraft cockpits,
agreed to buy Acterna Corp.'s Airshow unit in Tustin for $160 million
to gain electronic-control products for business jet passenger
cabins.</LD>
<LD>   The cash acquisition would dilute Rockwell Collins' fiscal 2003
profit slightly, the company said. Airshow, which had fiscal 2002
sales of $65 million, employs about 330.</LD>
<LD>   Airshow makes climate, light and video controls. The acquisition
would give Rockwell products to sell to such firms as General
Dynamics Corp.'s Gulfstream unit and Textron Inc.'s Cessna, said Pat
Zerbe, a spokeswoman for Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Rockwell fell 74 cents to $23.86 on the NYSE. They have
climbed 22% this year. Acterna, based in Germantown, Md., rose 28
cents, to 84 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase is expected to be finalized by Sept. 30.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. lawmakers have cut a deal to postpone most of the sale of
valuable wireless spectrum just days before the government is slated
to begin the auction, sources familiar with the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission is poised to begin
auctioning 758 wireless licenses Wednesday, but the sale has
attracted few big bidders or large wireless carriers because of
concerns about when the airwaves would be available.</LD>
<LD>   The airwaves to be sold are in the lower part of the 700-megahertz
band and are currently used by television broadcasters that operate
on channels 52-59 but are supposed to move to digital signals by 2007
at the earliest. That has added confusion to when the airwaves would
be available to the successful bidders.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc., the biggest local-telephone
company in 14 Western U.S. states, canceled a plan to sell as much as
$1.25 billion in securities to lower debt. The company, after eight
straight quarterly losses, must pare $26.4 billion in junk-rated debt
by year's end to avoid breaching bank-loan terms, analysts have said.</LD>
<LD>   The equity offer was scuttled because Qwest stock has fallen by
more than half since the plan was announced in February, and it would
have increased the number of shares outstanding, an analyst said.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Denver-based Qwest fell 12 cents to $4.15 on the NYSE.
They have dropped 71% this year.</LD>

<LD>Kmart Corp. had a first-quarter loss of $1.45 billion as the ailing
discount retailer slashed prices to clear out inventory and made
payments to cancel leases on 283 closed stores.</LD>
<LD>   The loss equaled $2.88 a share and swelled from $233 million, or
48 cents, a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Al Koch said. Sales
in the period ended May 1 fell 8.4% to $7.64 billion as the largest
U.S. retailer to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy lost more than $1
billion for the second straight quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart spent $1.02 billion to liquidate inventory and cancel leases
at the stores. Profit and sales were hurt as Kmart couldn't replenish
its stores quickly enough after vendors, concerned about being paid,
withheld shipments before the bankruptcy filing, investors said.
Sales at stores open at least a year fell 8.8%.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Troy, Mich.-based Kmart rose 2 cents to 93 cents on the

<HD>Messier Insists He's 'In Charge'</HD>
<DH>Media: Vivendi CEO rejects the idea that board members
closely monitor his decisions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier on Thursday
dismissed the suggestion that the French entertainment company's
board of directors has him on a tight leash.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm in charge," Messier said during a speech in New York. "If the
board is not satisfied with my job, they should oust me."</LD>
<LD>   The CEO was responding to the board's decision last month to
create a corporate governance committee that would oversee his
performance amid investor dissatisfaction that Vivendi's stock price
has dropped 50% this year. On Friday, a shareholder group asked a
French court to appoint an expert to audit the firm.</LD>
<TE>   The board's new committee is co-chaired by Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
whose family is Vivendi's largest shareholder and is unhappy over the
sharp slide in the value of its holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said that Vivendi, owner of Universal Studios, has hired
lawyer Ira Millstein to advise the committee on corporate governance
issues. Rival Walt Disney Co. also recently tapped Millstein as a
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial French executive also alluded to questions about
his relationship with Hollywood powerbroker Barry Diller, head of
Vivendi's U.S. film and television operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry has a great ego, true, but I don't care," Messier said.
"What I care about is talent."</TE>
<TE>   He said Diller may launch a music television channel to compete
with Viacom Inc.'s MTV. The channel would be built around Universal
Music Group, the industry leader.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear, however, how this would fit into Messier's plan to
cut Vivendi's $30-billion debt load through asset sales.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday Vivendi agreed to sell half of a Norwegian pay-TV unit
to Telenor for $274 million. Last week, Vivendi said it was selling a
money-losing Italian pay-TV firm to News Corp. Vivendi also is
reportedly close to selling its Canal Plus Technologies unit.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Wireless Stocks Plummet After Sprint Warning</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Wall Street lowers ratings on a slew of tech
shares as the carrier trims forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Distressed about markedly slower growth at Sprint Corp.'s wireless
unit, investors pounded wireless stocks Friday, sending several to
52-week lows as the overall market staggered to the end of another
losing week.</LD>
<LD>   Shares that track Sprint's mobile-telephone PCS Group plunged 27%,
while shares tracking its long-distance business sank 18%. Also
falling were shares of AT&amp;T Corp., AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc.,
Verizon Communications Inc., SBC Communications Inc. and BellSouth
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "Investors tend to take a machine gun and shoot the entire sector,
even though all the warnings came from Sprint," said stock analyst F.
Drake Johnstone of Davenport &amp; Co. in Richmond, Va.</LD>
<TE>   They were spurred in part by analysts. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and at least three other brokerages lowered
ratings on the wireless industry. Growth rates of more than 20% in
recent years probably will fall to as low as 10% this year amid
sagging demand and an overall telecommunications market reeling from
oversupply and heavy debt loads.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities Inc. is a bit more bullish, predicting that
the number of wireless customers in the United States will grow this
year by 14%--the slowest rate since the industry began in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been no clear bottom," said Donna Jaegers, an analyst at
Invesco Funds Group Inc. But "we're closer to the bottom than we were
before."</TE>
<TE>   The pummeling came after Sprint said after the markets closed
Thursday that its once fast-growing PCS business would add 10% to 15%
fewer subscribers this year, while its long-distance revenue would
drop at a mid-single-digit rate, instead of the low-single-digit rate
it had forecast.</TE>
<TE>   "Sprint has been the wireless sweetheart, the darling, through
this whole telecom scene," said Matthew Crakes at Merrill Lynch
Global Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But the Overland Park, Kan., company has been packing in new
wireless subscribers at the low end of the market, he said, and those
customers are less loyal and move more quickly for better deals. And,
he said, Sprint has had some problems collecting on billings.</TE>
<TE>   The PCS unit's heavy dependence on low-income customers was one
reason why Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. analyst Luiz Carvalho
downgraded the shares to "equal-weight / cautious" from "overweight /
cautious."</TE>
<TE>   "The long and short of it is that Sprint missed its numbers big
time," said stock analyst Todd Bernier of Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago. "That's a huge disappointment, because it was such a big
pacesetter for the industry."</TE>
<TE>   Investors, he fears, are incorrectly extrapolating from Sprint's
news that all wireless companies are in trouble. The Big Three--
Verizon, AT&amp;T Wireless and Cingular, a joint venture of BellSouth and
SBC--are strong enough and are generating enough cash flow to pay
their debts, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   But sales at Sprint PCS and Nextel Communications Inc. aren't
generating enough cash to service large debt loads, Johnstone said.
"PCS has $22 billion in debt, and more than $1 billion is due each
year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch cut the U.S. wireless industry to "reduce / sell,"
citing concern over price competition and slowing subscriber growth.
J.P. Morgan reduced its recommendation for the nation's wireless
industry to "market perform" from long-term "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Those downgrades are fine with investors and analysts such as
Crakes. "There's still some decent growth in the industry," he said.
"At these [price] levels, the stocks are pretty attractive. I
wouldn't sell, unless you think a company is going bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the industry has started to consolidate, and that
will drive up stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday, Sprint's wireless shares lost $1.59 to close at $4.40,
after trading as low as $3.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Its
long-distance shares lost $2.54 to close at $11.75, after falling as
low as $10 a share. Both stocks closed at new 52-week lows.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless closed down 60 cents at $5.75, a 52-week low, and
AT&amp;T dropped 20 cents to $10.18, after hitting a 52-week low during
the trading day. Bell South lost 79 cents to close at $31.66, and its
Cingular partner, SBC, fell 42 cents to $32.23. Verizon stock moved
the least, losing 4 cents to close at $41.31. All trade on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel, the only gainer in the group, rose 33 cents to $4.48 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<KH>ERA OF EXCELLENCE LOS ANGELES LAKERS (1960-72)</KH>
<HD>Heartache of a Champion</HD>
<DH>L.A. got its first title in 1972, but only after agonizing
setbacks against the Celtics in the Finals</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laker coach Bill Sharman was surprised to see Times sportswriter Mal
Florence, bags packed, leaving the team hotel in Milwaukee on a
January day in 1972.</LD>
<LD>   Florence had been following the team on its winning streak, which
had reached a record 33 games before Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the
Milwaukee Bucks had ended it the previous day, 120-104.</LD>
<LD>   "Where are you going, Mal?" Sharman asked.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't cover losers," snapped back Florence, without breaking
stride.</TE>
<TE>   Funny line.</TE>
<TE>   But it also reflected the perception of the day. Unlike the
Minneapolis Lakers or the Showtime Lakers or the current Lakers, the
team that had arrived here in 1960 carried a loser image for more
than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't that it was a dreadful team. In fact, the early Los
Angeles Lakers were pretty darn good. They had two of the brightest
stars in the game in Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. They had powerful
forwards in Rudy LaRusso and Happy Hairston. They had a colorful
coach in Fred Schaus and a colorful player in Hot Rod Hundley. And
overall, they had enough talent to make regular trips to the NBA
Finals.</TE>
<TE>   But once there, they had to play the dreaded Boston Celtics in
that chamber of horrors known as Boston Garden. Time and again, they
would come out second best, stamped as chokers who couldn't win the
big one.</TE>
<TE>   That was unfair. They simply couldn't beat the big one in the
middle, Boston center Bill Russell. He was only 6 feet 9, but in
those days, that was enough to make him a giant on the court, an
impregnable defensive force and a fierce and effective rebounder. The
Lakers, trying to match up with players like Ray Felix and Jim Krebs,
always came up short.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about frustration! In one game, Russell blocked a shot by
Felix. Then he did it again. And again and again and again. Finally,
Felix hooked one that went over Russell, over the basket, over the
backboard into the stands.</TE>
<TE>   Felix grinned and said to Russell, "That's one you'll never get,
baby."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if the Lakers were getting blown out of those
championship series. The Lakers came close on several occasions. But
that only made it more painful.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, Laker Frank Selvy had an open 15-foot jumper to win the
NBA Finals in Game 7 against the Celtics at Boston Garden, but
missed. Boston went on to win in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Laker announcer Chick Hearn felt that set the tone for a decade,
felt that if Selvy had made that shot, the difference in confidence
level and attitude between those teams might have altered all the
championship series that followed.</TE>
<TE>   For the 1968-69 season, the Lakers obtained center Wilt
Chamberlain, until then the most dominating force, in terms of
individual achievement, the league had ever known. Finally, a player
to counter Russell. With three superstars, the Lakers would surely
obliterate their image as perennial runners-up.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers made it back to the NBA Finals that season and found
their old nemesis, the Celtics, there. Ultimately it came down to a
seventh game, this time at the Forum, a game that would later be
referred to in anger and depression by Laker fans as "the balloon
game."</TE>
<TE>   The balloons were owner Jack Kent Cooke's idea. He had them placed
in the Forum rafters in anticipation of the celebration after his
team had broken the Celtic jinx.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, upon arriving the Forum, glanced up and saw the balloons,
then vowed they would not come down.</TE>
<TE>   And they didn't. Late in the game, Boston's Don Nelson fired a
shot at a crucial point. It missed the mark but bounced straight up,
then came down through the basket.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lost--as usual--108-106, but they couldn't blame it on
bad luck or bad karma. Their problem was bad feelings between
Chamberlain and Coach Bill van Breda Kolff. In the closing minutes,
Chamberlain had asked to be taken out, claiming he was injured. When
the Lakers rallied and Chamberlain asked to go back in, van Breda
Kolff told him the team was doing just fine without him.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers ended that season with Chamberlain on the bench, the
balloons in the rafters and their record of futility intact.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the 1970s, the Lakers had new hope because Father
Time had done what they never could: removed the Russell factor.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a new tormentor on the block in New York Knick
center Willis Reed.</TE>
<TE>   The 1969-70 season ended with the Lakers again in the NBA Finals,
this time playing the Knicks. Once again, it came down to a seventh
game, this time at Madison Square Garden. Reed wasn't supposed to
play because of a leg injury. But when he limped onto the court and
played the first few minutes, the emotional lift whipped the fans
into a frenzy and solidified the rest of the Knicks into an
unbeatable unit that crushed yet another Laker title dream.</TE>
<TE>   There would always be another chance to dream, but not for Baylor.
Age and injuries forced the high-flying Laker forward into retirement
nine games into the 1971-72 season.</TE>
<TE>   But as Baylor's flame was snuffed out, the rest of the Lakers were
suddenly ignited. Chamberlain and West were still playing at high
levels, Hairston was still a master rebounder, Jim McMillian was an
able replacement for Baylor at small forward and Gale Goodrich was an
ideal backcourt mate for West.</TE>
<TE>   The day after Baylor said goodbye, the Lakers took off on their
record 33-game winning streak, the longest for a professional team in
any sport. They finished the season with 69 wins, a record that stood
until the Chicago Bulls broke it with 72 victories in the 1995-96
season. Goodrich averaged 25.9 points in 1971-72, West 25.8.
Chamberlain and Hairston each pulled down 1,000 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers roared through the first two rounds of the playoffs,
sweeping Chicago in four games, then beating Milwaukee, the team that
had stopped their streak, in six.</TE>
<TE>   Ahead lay their old Waterloo, the NBA Finals, and a rematch with
the Knicks. In all, the Lakers had lost seven times in the Finals
after moving to Los Angeles, six of those to the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   All of their records in that unprecedented season would mean
nothing if it ended as had the others.</TE>
<TE>   But this Laker team was so talented, no barrier, no jinx could
withstand it. The team won the championship in five games, its first
since calling Los Angeles home.</TE>
<TE>   This, however, was no dynasty. The Lakers returned to the NBA
Finals the following season, but returned also to their losing ways,
New York winning in five.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the big names on their roster, the Lakers had that
elusive magic touch for only one season.</TE>
<TE>   It would take seven more years until they returned to the NBA
Finals, seven years until they got the Magic they needed to build a
dynasty worthy of the Minneapolis days.</TE>

<LD>Three consecutive years of Laker championship parades and they
haven't grown old yet. We could use even more days when people stream
through the downtown streets wearing the same colors, cheering and
chanting. We need more parades.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad it doesn't look as though we'll have one for our very own
NFL team.</LD>
<LD>   On the same day Los Angeles celebrated its dominance over the NBA,
it took a step away from the biggest and most exclusive club in
sports.</LD>
<TE>   Anschutz Entertainment Group, the group that built Staples Center,
is backing off its efforts to build a new downtown stadium and lure
an existing NFL franchise.</TE>
<TE>   I thought this was going to work. Phil Anschutz has the money.
They have the track record, primarily that big arena/parade route
destination on 11th and Figueroa. The NFL was interested.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Lakers were doing their part. When Game 7 of the
Sacramento series pulled a higher television rating in L.A. than this
year's Super Bowl, I figured the NFL owners would call up the moving
vans right then. You think the league could stand by and watch an NBA
playoff game outdraw the Super Bowl in the nation's second-largest
market?</TE>
<TE>   But three days later the Coliseum Commission decided it was going
to spend up to $1 million to promote the Coliseum as an NFL site.</TE>
<TE>   Why? The NFL doesn't want to go to the Coliseum. This seems to be
getting through to everyone except the Coliseum Commission.</TE>
<TE>   To borrow some words Laker forward Robert Horry used during the
victory rally: "They must not read newspapers."</TE>
<TE>   I'm as appreciative as anyone about the Coliseum's role in this
city's sports history. But it should be clear it doesn't have a part
in the future. By trying to involve it in the NFL mix, the commission
is turning it from landmark to obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong with the City Council's efforts--including a
potential lawsuit--to assure the AEG project wouldn't use public
funds. Someone needs to keep the private entities out of our pockets.</TE>
<TE>   But the Coliseum plan is nothing more than a what-about-us? move,
more self-serving than anything else. At the least, it could create a
bidding war. At worst it could mean no franchise in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   For now, it has served to make AEG want to say game over, man.</TE>
<TE>   "The plot's thickened," AEG President Tim Leiweke said. "We've got
to take a lickin'."</TE>
<TE>   Has he been hanging out with Johnnie Cochran?</TE>
<TE>   AEG wanted to buy the property just south of Staples Center (and
it must be some valuable real estate, because I paid $30 to park
there Friday), and use it for a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke dragged a reluctant Anschutz into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz wanted breakfast in bed. He would sign for it only if
Leiweke could put everything on the tray and deliver it to him. The
Coliseum Commission stuck out its foot just when Leiweke stepped off
the elevator.</TE>
<TE>   "We were always up front with the Coliseum folks that if they
jumped in, we respected that and we appreciated that, but at the same
time, we'd jump out," Leiweke said. "Because we're not going to enter
into a dysfunctional process and tie up tens of millions of dollars
on property without knowing what the process is. And we're not going
to get leveraged by the folks at the NFL on this.</TE>
<TE>   "The NFL's been great. I think there is a good opportunity to
bring a team back here. We just don't agree it's the Coliseum. If
they want to take another shot, then they're going to do it and we'll
sit on the sidelines."</TE>
<TE>   They could come back, but who knows if they can regain the
momentum they had?</TE>
<TE>   Sports matter. City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas referred to
their ability to produce "psychic income," and said "it has a lot to
do with the civic energy."</TE>
<TE>   "The larger a city is, the more it needs things that helps them
come together and be a city," Ridley-Thomas said. "Teams do that like
nothing else can."</TE>
<TE>   But he isn't helping when he insists that the Coliseum is the spot
for an NFL team, that all the supporting infrastructure is in place.</TE>
<TE>   All that's missing is someone committed to spending the $300
million to $400 million it will take to renovate the place, not to
mention a willingness for the NFL to kick in $150 million to help.</TE>
<TE>   You know, details.</TE>
<TE>   Am I being too negative? Sorry, didn't mean to. Friday was
supposed to be a time to party.</TE>
<TE>   As rapper/actor/Staples Center suite-holder Ice Cube said as he
walked around 11th Street: "Today is a good day. No doubt, no doubt."</TE>
<TE>   It's always good for a laugh when Mark Madsen dances. He didn't
appear to have his dancing shoes; he wore a pair of brown boot-like
shoes that Horace Grant gave him.</TE>
<TE>   "These got the job done last year," Madsen said.</TE>
<TE>   And they worked just fine this time. Madsen even looked as if he
had been practicing his moves.</TE>
<TE>   "He did more gyrations this year," Kobe Bryant said. "More
shoulder work. More footwork."</TE>
<TE>   Madsen said he just followed his dad's advice and "let it flow."</TE>
<TE>   No free-flowing rap for Shaquille O'Neal this year, but that
doesn't mean he was not deft with the mike. He was a good emcee. When
Chick Hearn brought him up as the final speaker, O'Neal responded
with a move as graceful as any baseline spin he made during the
playoffs and introduced the omitted Horry and Lindsey Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson didn't ride the full parade route and spoke briefly
at the rally. But he's becoming a larger part of this team. Bryant
and O'Neal called him the greatest coach in the game, and they seem
committed to helping him get a record 10th title next year.</TE>
<TE>   If he breaks the record with the Lakers, wins four or five
championships with the Lakers, do we think of him as a Laker ... and
not a former Chicago Bull coach with the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   It's getting there. He once had a jacket made that featured the
Bulls' logo on the outside and the logo of the team he played for,
the Knicks, on the inside. If jacket designs reflect his feelings,
then: "At this time I would say that I would have half of my jacket
purple and gold and half of my jacket red and black," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   It could be this city's most successful acquisition of a Chicago
icon since Hugh Hefner.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if we could just get somebody's NFL team.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, at least no one can say they're just hype any more.</LD>
<LD>   Nor are the Lakers the greatest team of all time. By normal
standards, winning three titles in a row is impressive but if you're
talking about dynasties, it's merely entry level.</LD>
<LD>   While we're attempting to place the Lakers in history, we should
note that newspaper stories don't decide this. History does, and it
isn't over.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, only three other NBA teams won three in a row
(Minneapolis Lakers, 1952-54; Boston Celtics, 1958-66; Chicago Bulls,
1991-93 and 1996-98) and the Lakers may not be through. Shaquille
O'Neal is 30, Kobe Bryant is 23 and Phil Jackson is coming back.</TE>
<TE>   These guys expect to take this further. They barely even bother to
celebrate any more.</TE>
<TE>   Remember O'Neal running madly up the floor with his arms extended
and his eyes bugging out after dunking that lob from Bryant to beat
the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference
finals?</TE>
<TE>   That's all over. Now they congratulate one another on a job well
done, as in Wednesday night's subdued reaction when O'Neal rubbed the
top of Mitch Richmond's head and later told ESPN's Stuart Scott:
"It's still not enough for me."</TE>
<TE>   What they have done to this point is nominate themselves for
greatness. Having separated themselves from the pack, they now have
to show they can separate themselves from the company of the other
great teams.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, since they were just hype as recently as the 1999
playoffs, this is remarkable progress.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment O'Neal arrived in the summer of 1996, everyone
assumed they would take over the league. Every game story that ran in
this newspaper that season was accompanied by a box comparing them to
the Lakers' greatest teams.</TE>
<TE>   That team, however, was a tad confused about certain key
questions, such as: Who's in charge here?</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had just come from Orlando, where the Magic had spent four
seasons building a team around him, with the requisite star perimeter
player in the young Penny Hardaway and a bunch of shooters.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, on the other hand, had a polyglot bunch of players
whom Jerry West had gathered by hook and crook. Some, such as Nick
Van Exel and Cedric Ceballos, were available only because they were
hard to deal with. Then there was the 17-year-old Bryant, fresh out
of Lower Merion High. Clueless as he was, he wasn't merely their
mascot. He was in the rotation and an instant fan favorite, to boot.</TE>
<TE>   In O'Neal's first Laker season, the Utah Jazz took them out in the
second round, 4-1. The series ended with Bryant throwing up four
airballs at the end of Game 5, a harbinger of things to come.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would they win the next season, when the Jazz took them out in
the West finals, 4-0, after the Lakers did their usual number,
proclaiming themselves the more talented team.</TE>
<TE>   This, of course, was an object lesson for them of how much talent
counted.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at what was on paper and I couldn't understand it," said
Rick Fox last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were the most talented team in the league. I thought
we had a chance to do some great things. But our heads were in
different places. Our ability to work together was nonexistent. We
were disjointed. We had no understanding of what it meant to play at
a championship level.... It's nice to have that talent, but it
doesn't also win you championships if you can't work together."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the worst was yet to come.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated in their search for a power forward to complement
O'Neal (as Horace Grant had in Orlando), they brought in Dennis
Rodman for their Ultimate Meltdown in 1999, culminating in another
4-0 exit, this one in the second round at the hands of the San
Antonio Spurs. Del Harris had been fired early in the season and
West, aghast at what was going on but unwilling to confront the
owner's favorite, all but disappeared for months.</TE>
<TE>   Forget dominating. The Lakers weren't even getting better.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Bryant had just become a starter and he and O'Neal weren't
getting along.</TE>
<TE>   A lot has changed in the ensuing three years.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever this becomes, six men will have played huge roles in
making it happen:</TE>
<TE>   * Jerry Buss. More detached than he had been in the Showtime
years, he nevertheless had one great moment in the summer of 1996,
when O'Neal, who had just built a huge home in Orlando and moved his
family to town, turned down a Laker offer of $97 million. With West
worrying it was time to go to Plan B--signing free agents Dikembe
Mutombo and Dale Davis--Buss told him to go for broke. So West gave
Anthony Peeler and George Lynch to Vancouver, freeing up $20 million
more to offer O'Neal. Orlando matched the offer, noting that with no
state income tax and more money up front, their bid was worth more.
O'Neal, who didn't feel like making subtle distinctions, felt
insulted and signed with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   * West. He did an incredible rebuilding job after Magic Johnson's
sudden retirement in 1991 dropped the curtain on Showtime. With the
rest of the old nucleus (James Worthy, Byron Scott, A.C. Green) on
its way out, West drafted Van Exel and Eddie Jones, stole Ceballos
from the Suns, got them all signed long-term and still kept his
payroll low, giving the Lakers the cap room to pursue O'Neal.
Meanwhile, they missed the playoffs only once.</TE>
<TE>   * Harris. Fired in the turbulent 1999 lockout-shortened season, he
never gets the credit due him. They were a disorganized 33-49 team
when he arrived in 1994. He organized them into a team that went
48-34, then 53-29. Had the Lakers remained a bad team, O'Neal
wouldn't have come.</TE>
<TE>   * O'Neal. Despite his childlike fondness for expensive toys and
super-heroes and off-season forays into rapping and acting, he always
tried to do whatever it took to win. He took a lot of flak for his
early-career disappointments, causing him to go off on anyone he
thought was letting the side--and him--down. His complaints about Van
Exel's joke about going to Cancun, when they trailed Utah, 3-0, in
1998, led to Nick's exile to Denver. Likewise, a Shaq recommendation
led to the surprise hiring of Jackson in 1999 when they were about to
rehire interim coach Kurt Rambis. Since then, with Jackson zinging
O'Neal, often more than Shaq likes, he has gone to a level all his
own.</TE>
<TE>   * Bryant. If Shaq was their man-child, Kobe was their child-man,
but he had problems- too. It took four years to break down the
distance between this self-contained young man and his teammates and
to get him to play with them, rather than ignore them. After a
particularly turbulent 2000-2001 season, in which Kobe found himself
at an impasse with both Jackson and O'Neal, he suddenly got with the
program last spring. The program hasn't been the same since.</TE>
<TE>   * Jackson. The final piece of the puzzle, he organized a bunch of
kids into a hard-working, professional team, throwing such talented
young players as Ruben Patterson over the side because he thought
they'd be hard to work with, bringing in used-up-looking old pros
like Ron Harper and Brian Shaw. Most important, Jackson got on top of
both O'Neal and Bryant, something none of their coaches had been able
to do.</TE>
<TE>   The rest is, or will be, history.</TE>

<TE>   Red had the same group of guys together for all those years and
didn't have the business affairs such as free agency to deal with.

<TE>   Mark Heisler, stop recommending Charles Oakley as if he is some
sort of major upgrade. What the Lakers need is an athletic power
forward who can run, make the short jumper, and truly defend the
Duncans, Wallaces and Webbers in the West. Players such as Keon
Clark, Antonio Davis, P.J. Brown, etc. An old Oakley can't do much
more than pick fights with Shaq and deceive the Lakers before going
elsewhere for more money.</TE>

<TE>   I found it interesting that it took all of about 30 seconds after
the Lakers wrapped up their third consecutive championship for Marv
Albert to mention the Sacramento Kings. I guess if you listen to Rick
Adelman whine long enough you too would probably start believing that
the best team in the West was not represented in the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry, did I miss something? Sacramento has home-court
advantage yet loses Games 1 and 7 in their own barn? If they really
were the best team, then they should be able to win crucial games at
home, right?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the "best" team didn't represent the West in the Finals.
Nope, just the better one.</TE>

<TE>   Shaq, as a lifelong Laker fan, I was thrilled when you signed in

now.</TE>
<TE>   But as you celebrate your third title, I can't help but feel
sorrow and pity for you. Your attitude toward your biological dad is
incomprehensible. I know you're hurt that he abandoned you, but he is
your flesh and blood. Granted, he was a troubled man, but he did
something only a loving father would do: He left you with a great
stepfather who he felt would be a better father to you than he could
ever be.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq, I implore you, Father's Day is coming up: Go to the Goodwill
shelter and give your dad a big hug and tell him you forgive him.</TE>

<TE>   Throughout the playoffs I have looked forward to reading your
great coverage of the Lakers (Rick Majerus rules!) But you blew it
big when you devoted front-page space to that giant photo and story

<KH>ROAD TO CHAMPIONSHIP REGULAR SEASON</KH>
<HD>Curing Sore Feet ... and Sore Feelings</HD>
<DH>Lakers: A regular season noted more for injuries,
inconsistent play and even some fights, gave way to another
postseason to cherish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The thing about raising banners and modeling championship rings is,
at some point you've got to play the season, like it or not.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers do regular seasons the way Allen Iverson does practice.
Even when they're there, their hearts aren't totally into it.</LD>
<LD>   They got through this season, however, and generally without the
fuss of the season before, though not seamlessly either.</LD>
<TE>   They wrapped and soaked Shaquille O'Neal's feet and played a
magical November, then became uninterested. For a while, they even
lost their voice.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, O'Neal's MVP pick from the beginning, became a team
captain at 23 and had only one or two leadership lapses. His maturity
and even play made him a first-team All-NBA guard for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, they arrived at the postseason reasonably hale and
confident, at about where Coach Phil Jackson had hoped, and glad to
be done with their regular-season requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty-two, they hardly knew you.</TE>
<TE>   From 16-1, or how the notion of 73-9 was born</TE>
<TE>   The best start in franchise history took the Lakers a week past
Thanksgiving and convinced many that this was a team destined to
challenge the Chicago Bulls' record 72-win season.</TE>
<TE>   In the early weeks, despite O'Neal's bad feet and the predictably
slow integration of newcomers Samaki Walker and Lindsey Hunter into
the triangle offense, the Lakers beat Utah twice, Sacramento,
Minnesota and Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   They opened the defense of their back-to-back championships the
night before Halloween by raising their championship banner. They
received their rings in a pregame ceremony from Laker Vice President
Jeanie Buss, who got a kiss from O'Neal and a high-five from Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Though the eyes of pro basketball were on New York, where Michael
Jordan attempted to exhume his former self and his former game, the
Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers by 11 points and began a
remarkable run, in spite of Jackson's uneasiness.</TE>
<TE>   "I always predict a slow start," he had said.</TE>
<TE>   In honor of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, Bryant wore shoes
decorated with the colors of the American flag.</TE>
<TE>   Off they went, through six weeks of wins and a lone loss, in
Phoenix, by a lopsided 95-83. Though players and coaches warned that
the team was not playing well despite the record, some said the
Lakers had a chance to win 73 regular-season games, which would
surpass the record set six years before by Jackson's Chicago Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Including the final eight games of the previous regular season and
their 15-1 postseason, the Lakers reached Dec. 7 with 39 wins in 41
games.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed the Lakers had found a formula in the previous season
and that their momentum did not fade in three months away.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the last two seasons, when conflict eventually gave way to
championships, the Lakers appeared emotionally secure.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep looking back to last year's start," forward Rick Fox
said, "and we have to be pretty satisfied that we've learned a little
bit about defending a championship and coming prepared to start the
season off in the right fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, at one point, held up his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "We're winning," he said, "but we can be so much better."</TE>
<TE>   Turned out, they were worse. For the next 2 1/2 months, into
mid-February, the Lakers were 19-15.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq's aches, or how the notion of 73-9 died</TE>
<TE>   There were times when Jackson didn't coach basketball as much as
he coaxed it.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, out of O'Neal and his sore feet.</TE>
<TE>   After spending most of the summer hoping his deformed left small
toe would heal, O'Neal had surgery in August, pretty much killing
training camp and his desire to go into the season at 290 pounds. He
missed that by plenty, some said by 70 pounds or more.</TE>
<TE>   Then, trying to limp through the early weeks and leaning hard on
his right foot, his arthritic right big toe became unbearably
painful, beginning a season-long experiment with new shoes and
orthotics and liniments and injections and anti-inflammatory drugs by
the fistful.</TE>
<TE>   The season had just started, and O'Neal practically had to be
carried from his car before games and back to it afterward. He had
lost his legendary mobility and hardly could get off the ground,
making his defense nonexistent and his offense limited to the basics.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of November, he averaged 24.7 points and 10.9 rebounds,
well below his career numbers.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Day, he went to the injured list for the first time.
In all, he missed 15 games to injury or suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he had his moments. Early in the season, against Horace
Grant, Patrick Ewing, Andrew DeClercq and whatever else the Orlando
Magic found handy, O'Neal scored 38 points, took 18 rebounds, blocked
four shots and reminded everyone what's what in the NBA, and who's
who.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still the baddest bad-feet big man ever," he said, grinning.</TE>
<TE>   He was grumpy, however. He hated the new rules that allowed zone
defenses from the start. Defenders took advantage of the new,
sedentary Shaq by fouling him hard and often. He was on the injured
list twice for his feet, missed two late-season games with a sprained
wrist and was suspended for three games for the air punch that buffed
Brad Miller's ear.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers looked thin without O'Neal, and the fear grew within
the organization that this was the O'Neal it would take into the
postseason. Bryant, however, knew better.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it really matters, because we aren't going to play
without Shaquille in the playoffs," he said. "It doesn't matter,
because our team is with Shaquille. We're going to win a championship
with Shaquille. That's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   When O'Neal returned from the injured list to play the Phoenix
Suns despite little relief in his toe, he said he did it "because I'm
back on the [anti-inflammatory] drugs. Hopefully, the drugs will
carry me."</TE>
<TE>   Though he once said, in jest, "I'll keep going until I'm Bill
Walton," O'Neal revealed late in the season that he probably would
have surgery this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the pain to go away forever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He finished the season averaging 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds,
still enough to rate third in the league MVP vote.</TE>
<TE>   They like each other, they really, really do</TE>
<TE>   The days O'Neal and Bryant would pass in the locker room without
finding each other's eyes were over, buried by the championships
taken and the hand extended.</TE>
<TE>   For more than four years as Lakers they were teammates and barely
that. They were close enough to lift a trophy together and still
found little common ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was part of the process," Bryant said a year later.
"Things got out of hand. One thing we didn't do, we didn't sit down
and talk about it. In retrospect, we should have done that right
then."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it lingered for seasons and cost them who knows how much
in victories and peace of mind. It ended perhaps a year ago, when
O'Neal called Bryant his idol and held out his fist, and Bryant
touched it with his.</TE>
<TE>   Friendships come easily in big wins, however, and everyone knew
this one would be tested in the doldrums of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The months passed, and they didn't roll their eyes anymore. They
laughed together after games. There were fewer fears of O'Neal's bad
moods, forced because of a shot Bryant had taken the night before.
And they didn't measure Bryant's coolness after he sensed O'Neal's
displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes for good harmony," Jackson said. "I compared it the
other day to like a dog and a cat. The dog goes around and makes the
cat hump its back and spit a little bit. Then, all of a sudden, when
they get to be friends, the cat starts bouncing around all over the
dog. That's the way it appears to be, with Kobe being the cat."</TE>
<TE>   One Saturday night in Ardmore, Pa., in a stone building at Lower
Merion High, Bryant had his jersey retired.</TE>
<TE>   His parents sat to his right. His young wife, Vanessa, sat ahead
of him. Some 1,500 friends, classmates and fans sat behind them.
There were many highlights of Kobe, bald, crossing over 10th-graders.</TE>
<TE>   All that was expected.</TE>
<TE>   What surprised them, what made Bryant smile and touch his chest,
were the large men in the third row. From left to right: Shaquille
O'Neal, Brian Shaw, Samaki Walker, Devean George, Mark Madsen and
Rick Fox.</TE>
<TE>   They watched the videos. They applauded the superintendent of
schools. They laughed with the kid with the funny stories about Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   When it was done, O'Neal rose first and strode to the stage and
held out his hand, and Bryant hugged him instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you guys," Bryant said to them, to everyone, over and
over.</TE>
<TE>   Zen and the art of Shaq O'Neal maintenance</TE>
<TE>   It was Jackson's job to push O'Neal through his injuries and
maladies. It was O'Neal's nature to resist.</TE>
<TE>   And so went the season, beginning in training camp, when Jackson
considered O'Neal's early free-throw troubles and said, "It's a dire,
a scary situation right now," and O'Neal nearly went apoplectic.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal should not have felt undercut. It simply was his turn, as
it had been Bryant's last season, when Jackson blindsided him with
various observations of conscience and sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, O'Neal balanced his angry retorts with promises to retire
with Jackson in two years, at 32 years old, a life decision that
would have him turn his back on nearly three-quarters of the
$88-million extension he had signed the year before.</TE>
<TE>   In October, O'Neal missed a few free throws, which Jackson
noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "He always has something to say," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   It was suggested to O'Neal that this was Jackson's way to motivate
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't Toni [Kukoc]. I ain't ... Horace [Grant]," O'Neal said of
two famed Jackson targets. "I don't need motivation. I'm already
motivated. I don't worry about that stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "However, I don't get into that, how they treat me. I do my job.
It ain't over for me. I don't ever start it. I don't start anything.
But any man who stands for nothing, will fall for everything.</TE>
<TE>   "I got two championships. That ain't enough for him? That guy
never shuts up."</TE>
<TE>   A day later, they found themselves on the same dais at the Westin
Bonaventure Hotel. Jackson poked him again over his free throws and
announced, "He's been in a bad mood ever since the toe operation."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal fumed.</TE>
<TE>   In November, O'Neal missed two practices to attend the birth of
his daughter. One was excused, the other was not, and he was fined
for the second.</TE>
<TE>   "That [gentleman] knows what he can do with that fine," O'Neal
said.</TE>
<TE>   They lived together on the edge of civility thereafter, Jackson
occasionally wondering about O'Neal's conditioning, O'Neal
occasionally answering with 40-point games and end-to-end defense and
sneers.</TE>
<TE>   It would, of course, lead to other uncomfortable moments in the
playoffs. But in the end, Jackson and O'Neal always came back to the
same reality: They needed each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the type of guy," O'Neal said, "if something goes down on
Tuesday, I leave it on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't play for anybody else. Well, unless I get traded or
something."</TE>
<TE>   They're so bored, they lost to Chicago--twice</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the Lakers were good. Sometimes, they were exceptional.</TE>
<TE>   And then there were the other nights.</TE>
<TE>   Six of them, each more grizzly than the last:</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 21, at Memphis. Grizzlies 114, Lakers 108.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 26, at Golden State. Warriors 101, Lakers 90.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 12, at Chicago. Bulls 106, Lakers 104. In overtime, at least.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 22, vs. Denver. Nuggets 107, Lakers 91.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 16, vs. Miami. Heat 102, Lakers 96.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 6, vs. Chicago. Bulls 97, Lakers 89.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lost those six games to teams in last place at the
moment of the opening tip, and so they will be featured in more
highlight videos than any back-to-back-to-back champions in history.</TE>
<TE>   Crummy teams danced off the floors behind them. Coaches' jobs were
saved. Summers were lengthened. Fans had hope. Jerry Krause probably
even smiled, some.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Lakers' gift to David Stern and NBA parity. The
unconscionable losses cost them a Pacific Division title and
home-court advantage, and maybe an ounce of pride, but this was their
duty.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all about the NBA," Fox said, smiling crookedly. "We're all
about lifting the spirit of the NBA, keeping everybody interested,
not just in us, but other teams."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was limping and two starters--Hunter and Walker--were new
to the triangle offense. The defense had a definite midseason malaise
to it. Everyone had an eye on the playoffs, and often played like it,
causing Jackson to doubt if he owned their psyches or ever would.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing you can do about it," Bryant said after one
terrible loss. "You can't take them back. There's no sense in blowing
up.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going for a three-peat. It's going to be harder, more
difficult, more challenging. We have to be patient with the offense,
with ourselves and believe it's going to come around."</TE>
<TE>   Portland's Steve Kerr, Jackson's former guard who was swept by the
Lakers in the playoffs as a San Antonio Spur a year ago, put the
league's growing confidence to words.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, last year the Lakers looked unbeatable," he said. "Now
they look a little more vulnerable. They are still by far the best
team and the team to beat, but Shaq doesn't quite look right. He
looks like he is banged up a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, they miss [Ron] Harper and Horace Grant and they are not
as strong as they were last year. If a team goes in and plays them
tough, plays them smart, then they are vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were great when it was worth the trouble, but sometimes
had neither the legs nor the heart for it, proving they could be had
in winter, if not in spring. They picked their moments, often right
in the middle of them, and in the end it mattered not at all.</TE>
<TE>   The boxer and one defense by Shaq</TE>
<TE>   Hacked for a decade, O'Neal came within an ear hair of the largest
mistake of his career, a wild overhand right that nearly finished
Brad Miller on a rainy January night in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly still growing into his role as a team leader, Bryant threw
a short punch that landed on the cheek of Walker on the bus ride from
a Cleveland hotel to Gund Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days later, seconds after the final buzzer sounded on a
victory in Los Angeles, Bryant charged after Indiana's Reggie Miller,
throwing at least one punch as the two tumbled onto the scorer's
table.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was suspended without pay for three games and fined
$15,000. On the bus leaving the United Center, O'Neal told Fox it was
merely the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how it's going to be from here on out," he said. "I'm not
going for this no more."</TE>
<TE>   A long time passed before O'Neal spoke again.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't a punk and I ain't a whiner," he said. "I got nothing to
say."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw addressed it for him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about the suspension or the money," he said. "It's about
the respect. You can be physical, but you have to be clean. As big
and strong as he is, when he does it it's always in self-defense. You
never see him go over and try to take somebody's head off. As big and
strong as he is, if he did that, somebody would really get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to restrain himself every day. A lot of fouls for
everybody else are not going to be fouls to him. He accepts that for
the most part. But if it's a foul it's a foul, regardless of how
strong the guy is."</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks later, it was Bryant who was surly, first lashing out at
Walker, then Miller.</TE>
<TE>   An amiable sort, Walker, who sported a fresh lump under his eye,
said he hadn't minded the confrontation at all. Indeed, he said, "It
was good to see the intensity."</TE>
<TE>   Any more intensity, someone would have been eating through a straw
for a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Juvenile play," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   So cool in his first five seasons, Bryant lost it again on the
floor of Staples Center, reacting to trash talk by balling his right
hand and chasing Miller. He was suspended for two games.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys need to defend themselves," Derek Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal tried again March 15. After tangling with Clipper center
Michael Olowokandi during a game, he attempted to enter the Clipper
locker room afterward. When that failed, he waited near the parking
lot.</TE>
<TE>   "Beat it," he said to a bystander. "You don't need to see this."</TE>
<TE>   Asked then about the sudden courage shown by opposing
centers--Miller, Danny Fortson a few nights earlier and Olowokandi,
in particular--O'Neal said, "The refs let them do whatever they want,
and then these bums think they can play."</TE>
<TE>   The day that Chick didn't come to work</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 20, someone other than Chick Hearn called a Laker game for
the first time since Nov. 21, 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn's run of 3,338 consecutive games ended when he required
surgery to replace a heart valve. Two months later, after a fall,
Hearn had hip replacement surgery.</TE>
<TE>   On April 9, with wife Marge at his side and after an extended
standing ovation, Hearn called a 30-point victory over the Utah Jazz.
He missed 56 games.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of coming back, after you miss 50-something games,
that's a while," Hearn said. "I've missed the familiarity of it. But
the reception I got from the players when I was there brought me up
tremendously.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized I missed the camaraderie of the coaching staff and the
players and the press. There's a bond that develops when you're there
every day. It gets to be routine."</TE>
<TE>   Upon Hearn's return, the Lakers distributed buttons that declared,
"Win With Chick," and mug shots of Hearn on sticks that fans waved at
him.</TE>
<TE>   Four months before, Stu Lantz, Hearn's partner for 15 years, sat
behind a microphone in Houston, welcomed replacement Paul Sunderland,
and shook his head at the task ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very strange," Lantz said. "It's strange and it hasn't even
started yet. I can't even envision it happening. The one constant
with this franchise, in its existence in Los Angeles, has been Chick.
Players come and go. Jerry, Elgin, Wilt, Kareem, Magic, now we've got
Shaq, Kobe. They'll have to go at some point in time. But the one
constant through all of that has been Chick. You've never heard a
Laker broadcast without Chick. I can't envision what that's going to
be like."</TE>

<KH>ERA OF EXCELLENCE MINNEAPOLIS LAKERS (1948-55)</KH>
<HD>The Original Big Man</HD>
<DH>With the mighty Mikan, Lakers won six titles in seven
years, including five NBA crowns</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB WOLF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A three-peat obviously is a big deal, but how about a double
three-peat?</LD>
<LD>   As dominant as the Lakers have been in winning three consecutive
NBA championships, they are only halfway toward matching the
achievement of their ancestors from Minneapolis half a century ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Minneapolis Lakers, coached by John Kundla, won three titles
in a row, fell short the next season, then won three more NBA titles.</LD>
<TE>   Six championships in seven years--two three-peats!</TE>
<TE>   Those early Lakers did their winning in three leagues, though,
and, completing the unlikely picture, did it in the first seven years
of their existence.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were founded in 1947 as a member of the National
Basketball League, the first truly major pro basketball league, and
celebrated their birth by winning the championship in the spring of
'48. The next season, they jumped to the Basketball Assn. of America,
forerunner of the NBA, and won again. The NBA recognizes that as the
Lakers' first NBA title.</TE>
<TE>   The season after that, the NBL and BAA were merged into the NBA,
and the Lakers won again.</TE>
<TE>   The streak ended in the 1951 NBA playoffs when the Lakers lost to
the Rochester Royals, now the Sacramento Kings, in the Western
Division finals.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was another three-season run before they lost in 1955
to the Fort Wayne--now Detroit--Pistons, again in the Western
Division finals.</TE>
<TE>   After that, age took its toll on the Lakers and as defeats piled
up, attendance fell off so sharply that the team was moved to Los
Angeles in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Just as with the champion Lakers of today, the key to the team's
success was an overpowering center. The Minneapolis version of
"Superman" Shaquille O'Neal was George Mikan. His horn-rimmed glasses
gave him a Clark Kent look, but he was a mighty man in his own right.</TE>
<TE>   Mikan, who had played at DePaul University in Chicago, stood 6
feet 10 and weighed 245 pounds. That's commonplace now, but he was
basketball's first dominant big man and in 1950 was voted the
greatest player of the half-century.</TE>
<TE>   So huge was Mikan in the basketball spectrum that when the Lakers
played the Knicks in New York at the height of his career, the
marquee outside Madison Square Garden read, "TONIGHT: GEORGE MIKAN
VS. KNICKS."</TE>
<TE>   In an era in which a 20-point game was a rarity, Mikan averaged
16.5, 21.3, 28.3, 27.4, 28.4, 23.8, 20.6 and 18.1 over eight seasons
from 1946-47 through 1953-54. He retired after that, shortly before
his 30th birthday, then came back in 1955-56 for 37 games, averaging
10.5. His career average was 22.6.</TE>
<TE>   Dominant as he was, Mikan was surrounded by talent. Three of his
teammates--Jim Pollard, Vern Mikkelsen and Slater "Dugie"
Martin--eventually joined him and Kundla in the Basketball Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   But Mikan was "the franchise" and when he left, the Lakers of
Minneapolis ceased to be a major factor in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Mikan, 78, who had a long career as an attorney after retiring
from basketball, talked about the old days from his home in
Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one of the best point guards in the game in Dugie Martin,"
Mikan said. "He fed me for a lot of my points, and he even gave Bob
Cousy a lot of trouble. Mikkelsen was our power forward, and he was a
great shooter. He scored 18-20 points a game. Pollard was our small
forward and one of the finest players in history. They called him
'the Kangaroo Kid.' He could dribble, shoot, anything. He had the
whole game."</TE>
<TE>   Among Mikan's other teammates were Herman Schaefer, Arnie Ferrin,
Don Carlson, Tony Jaros, Bob Harrison, Pep Saul, Whitey Skoog and a
backup named Bud Grant, later to become famous as the coach of the
NFL's Minnesota Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if there were any way to compare the current Laker champions
with those of his era, Mikan said, "Fifty years later, one thing
remains the same. We played team basketball, like they do, and Coach
Kundla put it all together. He was a great coach."</TE>
<TE>   Mikan was a gangling youngster weighing 190 pounds when Ray Meyer,
DePaul's Hall of Fame coach, took him in tow, but as he filled out
and gained coordination, he matured into the toughest kid on the
block.</TE>
<TE>   Times sportswriter Steve Springer summed up Mikan's credentials in
a 1999 story:</TE>
<TE>   "Combining great agility for a big man with a smooth shooting
touch, a hook shot that was deadly from either side, elbows that
could slice an opponent's face like a boxer's jab, and a highly
competitive spirit, Mikan sometimes seemed like a one-man gang."</TE>
<TE>   Could Mikan compete successfully in the NBA today?</TE>
<TE>   "I think I could," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mikan's trademark was his sweeping hook shot, and old-time
observers compare it favorably with the so-called sky hook of a
latter-day Laker, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</TE>
<TE>   "Kareem copied my hook shot," Mikan said.</TE>
<TE>   Good as Mikan's Lakers were, they were a party to the
lowest-scoring game in NBA history, and the way it ended troubles
Mikan to this day. On Nov. 22, 1950, at the Minneapolis Auditorium,
the Lakers lost to Fort Wayne, 19-18.</TE>
<TE>   "Murray Mendenhall was the Pistons' coach, and they stalled from
the beginning," Mikan recalled. "We would go downcourt and score
quickly, and they would go back into their stall.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally got up by one point with a few seconds left and Larry
Foust, their center, drove to the basket. I deflected the ball and,
lo and behold, it went into the basket as the game ended. I was just
trying to block the shot without fouling and I put in the winning
basket for the wrong team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a sad day for us because we had a full house [7,021] on
'Fathers and Sons Day.' "</TE>
<TE>   Full houses were not the norm in those days, when pro basketball
was still fighting for acceptance in the sports world.</TE>
<TE>   After that game, the NBA moved to prevent any recurrence by
installing the 24-second clock. The idea has always been attributed
to Danny Biassone, owner of the Syracuse Nationals--now the
Philadelphia 76ers--but Mikan gives equal credit to co-owner Max
Winter of the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "The 19-18 game really hurt Max, and he pushed for the clock,"
Mikan said. "He had a lot to do with the change."</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side of the scoring ledger, Mikan scored a career-high
61 points against Rochester at Minneapolis on Jan. 20, 1952.</TE>
<TE>   "My hook shot was really working that night, and I put in quite a
few rebounds," he said. "I used to score a lot of points by putting
in rebounds."</TE>
<TE>   Mikan didn't start his pro career as a Laker. After completing his
All-American career at DePaul, he joined the Chicago Gears in 1946
and promptly led them to the NBL championship. Then Maurice White,
owner of the Gears, made a mistake that ultimately presented the
newly organized Lakers the hottest property in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   White put together a league of 24 teams, his Gears among them, and
called it the Professional Basketball League of America. It folded
after only two weeks and in a dispersal draft, Mikan went to the
Lakers, the NBL's newest team.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' three owners--Winter, Ben Berger and Carl Chalfon--had
been prepared to fight for survival but suddenly found themselves
with a hot ticket. The championships promptly followed.</TE>
<TE>   The first Laker dynasty might have lasted even longer if Mikan
hadn't retired so early.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a family and it was time to practice law and take care of
my family," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers coaxed Mikan back to coach the team in 1957, but he
resigned after a 9-30 start. He served briefly as the first
commissioner of the American Basketball Assn. before going back to
law.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Lakers slipped after Mikan left, their outlook
improved before they headed west. Elgin Baylor arrived in 1958 and
with Jerry West coming out of college, they had a head start toward
success in Tinseltown.</TE>

<KH>ROAD TO CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS VS. NEW JERSEY</KH>
<HD>Still the Kings</HD>
<DH>The Nets were the opponent, but the Lakers found motivation
in the Golden State's capital</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the cowbells and complaints of Sacramento still ringing in their
ears and their eyes fixated on a place in history, the Lakers
embarked on the last stage of their quest, against the New Jersey
Nets.</LD>
<LD>   As was often the case during the season, the toughest challenge
they faced came from themselves. Would they suffer too much of a
letdown after the dramatic Western Conference finals against the
Kings? Could they take the overmatched Nets seriously? Did they have
enough energy remaining?</LD>
<LD>   It turns out the King series didn't drain the Lakers. It made them
appreciate how close they were to missing out on not only this
championship, but the chance to rank among the all-time great
champions.</LD>
<TE>   And Shaquille O'Neal was motivated. That was enough.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't get angry at the Nets because he had too much respect
for New Jersey Coach Byron Scott, a one-time Laker teammate.</TE>
<TE>   So he raged at the whining of Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman, who
used the days after the Kings' elimination to point out that O'Neal
had stepped over the line on his free throws.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal reminded himself of the shots he took from the media
earlier in his career, when he was accused of pursuing rap and movie
careers with more vigor than an NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   And the native of Newark wanted to win a championship in front of
his family in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The series ended early, but not before O'Neal set records for
points, free throws and blocked shots in a four-game Finals.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal played with vigor and an energy level that hadn't been seen
too often during the regular season. His various injuries, most
notably his arthritic right big toe, weren't a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Neither, it turned out, were the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever hangover effect the Lakers experienced was exceeded by
the Nets' anxiety about appearing in their first Finals.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA Finals are more than just the logos on the floor and the
extra decorations hanging around the arena. The Finals bring on an
intense media demand.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters crowd the locker room and make it difficult for players
to make their way to their seats. Interview requests seem to come
from every channel available by satellite.</TE>
<TE>   And friends and long-lost cousins want tickets.</TE>
<TE>   That resulted in some dismal shooting and a 14-point output by the
Nets in the first quarter of Game 1. Welcome to the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had 36 points and 16 rebounds, and that was pretty much
that, as the Lakers won, 99-94. It might have been the least
competitive five-point game ever.</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 featured more of the same, as O'Neal finished with 40
points and eight assists and the Lakers won, 106-83. In 96 minutes of
basketball, the Nets held the lead for 117 seconds. They surrendered
it after going ahead 4-2 in the first game and didn't see it again
until they got to the Meadowlands.</TE>
<TE>   After traveling to the East Coast on the off day, the Lakers' next
concern was finding a place to watch the Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson
fight.</TE>
<TE>   The boxing went down a lot like this series. Lewis landed his jab
whenever he wanted to, keeping Tyson at bay. And there wasn't a thing
Tyson could do about it.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq had people wondering if all-time greats such as Bill Russell
or Wilt Chamberlain could have guarded him. What chance did the Nets
have with a trio of centers named Todd MacCulloch, Aaron Williams and
Jason Collins?</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal got position just about anywhere he wanted against all of
them. They developed a regular routine of fouling him, then heading
to the bench. O'Neal went through the Net centers like a roll of
paper towels. It was almost like watching an awesome lineup wear out
another team's pitching staff, except O'Neal did all the heavy
hitting himself.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq's dominance gave the Lakers a 2-0 lead, and Kobe Bryant had
yet to join the party, scoring a modest 46 points through two games.</TE>
<TE>   It showed how much he had grown and accepted his role on the team,
how he realized that the Lakers were sometimes better off when he
tried to do less.</TE>
<TE>   But the inner drive that pushes Bryant to be the best can be
suppressed only for so long. Game 3 would be his time. He took 23
shots and made 14 of them, by far his best shooting performance of
the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   There were times that he could have passed the ball in to O'Neal,
but he decided he wanted it, as if it were his turn to buy a round of
drinks.</TE>
<TE>   With half a minute left in the fourth quarter, with the Lakers
ahead by two, they came out of a timeout and Bryant was casually
bobbing his head to the arena music as he waited for the ball to be
inbounded. There was no doubt he was going to get the ball and score,
which is exactly what he did, and the Lakers were about to
successfully rally from a seven-point deficit to a 106-103 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Just a reminder that the Lakers also have the second-best player
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the Nets had put together a good enough game
to win. Their most-valuable-player candidate, Jason Kidd, had 30
points and 10 assists. Kenyon Martin played like a No. 1 overall pick
and scored 26 points. All it did was get the Nets closer ... to the
edge of elimination.</TE>
<TE>   No team had come back from an 0-3 deficit to win an NBA playoff
series, and the Nets weren't sending off any signals that they would
become the first.</TE>
<TE>   If history was to be made, it would come from the Lakers. They had
a chance to record only the seventh sweep in NBA Finals history. Phil
Jackson could move ahead of Pat Riley with 156 career playoff
coaching victories and tie Red Auerbach's record of nine
championships.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Game 4 rolled around, the only suspense was which
jersey Bryant would wear to the arena.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the playoffs he had paid tribute to greats from a
variety of sports by wearing the uniforms of Derek Jeter, Pedro
Martinez, Mariano Rivera, Hank Aaron, Jackie Robinson, Joe Montana,
Joe Namath, Jerry West and Wayne Gretzky.</TE>
<TE>   He promised to wear the jersey of "the best" for Game 4, and when
he arrived at Continental Airlines Arena for the clincher, he wore
the familiar white Chicago Bulls' No. 23 of Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   A good choice except for one thing: the color. Bryant should have
realized that the most memorable Jordan moments came in the red road
jersey. The 63 points in Boston. Those two buzzer-beating shots to
finish off the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Sick Game in Utah. That sick
dunk, when he spun baseline at Madison Square Garden and jammed on
Patrick Ewing. And the last shot he took for the Bulls, that jumper
with the hand extended for effect that delivered their sixth
championship. All on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Bryant's fashion oversight caused him to get off to a bad
start. He missed four of his first five shots and seven of his first
10.</TE>
<TE>   But Bryant is putting together a reputation for coming up big in
the fourth quarter on the road himself. He made four of his last six
shots and scored 11 points in the quarter to bring the Lakers home.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal showcased the newest component of his game and made four of
five free throws in crunch time as the Lakers held off the Nets for a
113-107 victory.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 34 points, leading the most balanced Laker scoring
of the series. Bryant had 25, Derek Fisher scored 13, Robert Horry
had 12 and Devean George had 12. Even Mitch Richmond, the former
All-Star who had been relegated to the bench, entered the game and
scored two points.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond finally had his championship ring. He had played 14 years
and put up a lot of points for a lot of bad teams, without one.</TE>
<TE>   This could be it for him. But the Lakers didn't sound ready to
stop after three consecutive championships.</TE>
<TE>   Other people were making comparisons to the Bulls of the 1990s or
the Lakers of the 1980s. The Lakers said they couldn't wait to play
the Sacramento Kings again next year.</TE>

<HD>Three-Peat Is Filled With Remarkable Moments</HD>

<LD>It wasn't the statistics that made your stomach jump.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't the scores that made your throat tighten.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't the records or matchups or strategies that kept you on
the edge of sanity for three springs.</LD>
<TE>   It was the moments.</TE>
<TE>   Long after these Lakers become old-timers like the Showtimers,
what we'll remember most are the moments.</TE>
<TE>   One man's top 10 moments of the three-peat, in reverse order of
importance. (Like the Lakers, we're going to try to keep you in
suspense until the end.):</TE>
<TE>   10. THE NO-LOOK</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth game of the 2001 Western Conference finals
against San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It was entertaining and intimidating and perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal grabbed a rebound, dribbled past the midcourt
line, then suddenly flipped a no-look pass to Kobe Bryant on his
right.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant passed the ball back.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal dunked it.</TE>
<TE>   Like Michael Jordan, only bigger.</TE>
<TE>   The players howled, the Staples Center roared, the Spurs were
swept.</TE>
<TE>   This near-perfect postseason body of work had been given a face.</TE>
<TE>   9. THE SURPRISE LOOK</TE>
<TE>   It was the third game of the 2000 Western Conference finals in
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   The series was tied, the score was tied, 29.9 seconds remained,
when an old man appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Harper, standing alone, on the left side, 19 feet from the
rim.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant threw it to him. Harper threw it into the basket. The
Lakers survived a game that could have ended all this before it
started.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew where to find Harper," Bryant said later. "He'd been
telling me about it all game long."</TE>
<TE>   8. THE AWAKENING</TE>
<TE>   It was the second game of the second round of the 2000 playoffs
against Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Still weary from a first-round push by Sacramento, the Lakers had
played terribly against the Suns and were just moments from losing
home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   They trailed by one. Less than 10 seconds remained. They were out
of rhythm. They couldn't win this as a team.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody had to do it one on one.</TE>
<TE>   Was anybody surprised when Bryant raised his hand?</TE>
<TE>   He dribbled downcourt to the foul line and calmly nailed a
14-footer over Jason Kidd's outstretched arms with 2.6 seconds
remaining for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had a flashback to when I was a kid," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   A flashback? At the time, he was 21.</TE>
<TE>   7. THE KNOCKOUT</TE>
<TE>   It was the third game of the 2001 NBA Finals in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher and O'Neal had fouled out. The Lakers led by one
point. There were 47.1 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The series was even. This was where the 76ers would make their
title run.</TE>
<TE>   This was where Robert Horry said, um, well, maybe not now, you
know?</TE>
<TE>   He took a pass, blinked himself alert, and threw down a
three-pointer to clinch the game and perhaps win a championship.</TE>
<TE>   The moment seemed to stun even him, as he turned to the
once-roaring crowd and pumped his fist at their silence.</TE>
<TE>   6. THE MESSAGE</TE>
<TE>   It was the third game of the first round of the 2002 playoffs in
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   There were 10 seconds remaining, the Lakers trailed by a basket,
Bryant had the ball, and guess what? He didn't shoot.</TE>
<TE>   He dribbled into double coverage and passed it to Horry in the
right corner, just beyond the three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   With 2.1 seconds remaining, you know what Horry did.</TE>
<TE>   His game-winning three-pointer, completing a three-game sweep,
dictated the following memo to the rest of the NBA:</TE>
<TE>   If you are going to beat the Lakers, you are going to have to beat
all of them.</TE>
<TE>   5. THE MAGIC</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth game of the second round of the 2002 playoffs
against San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   With about 10 seconds remaining and the score tied, Fisher had
just thrown up a bad shot that would give the Spurs the ball and a
chance to win and equal the series.</TE>
<TE>   Then out of nowhere, he appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Who else?</TE>
<TE>   With his left hand, Bryant grabbed a rebound. With his right hand,
he returned the ball to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   With both hands, he clapped in scowling finality as the ball went
through the net.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's not amazing," said Samaki Walker, "then there is no
amazing."</TE>
<TE>   4. THE ACROBAT</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth game of the 2000 Finals at Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   It was overtime, O'Neal had fouled out, Bryant was nursing a badly
sprained ankle that had sidelined him the previous game, and the
Lakers led by one with about six seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Brian Shaw had just missed an easy shot.</TE>
<TE>   Time for a "Hoosiers" reenactment?</TE>
<TE>   Not when Bryant was still around to shout, "Cut!"</TE>
<TE>   Bryant followed Shaw to the basket, grabbing the rebound from the
stunned Pacers and, in the same motion, threw in a follow-shot with
two hands over his head.</TE>
<TE>   Lakers lead by three, Lakers win.</TE>
<TE>   "Ain't nothing wrong with that man's ankle," said Pacer Sam
Perkins. "I've been trying to tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   3. THE SWIMMER</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh game of the 2002 Western Conference finals in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   There were 46.3 seconds left in regulation, the score was tied,
and you probably will never see this on any highlight film.</TE>
<TE>   But a shot was missed, the ball bounced toward the baseline, and
Vlade Divac dived for it ... but Bryant dived under him.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if he were doing the breaststroke on the hardwood,
furiously paddling toward a championship.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant beat Divac to the ball. Divac was assessed his sixth foul
in the ensuing scrum. It was the Game 7 story in one moment.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Divac was lying on the baseline with his head in his
hands while Bryant swaggered over him to the foul line.</TE>
<TE>   If they were to issue a commemorative postage stamp of the 2002
championship, that scene would be it.</TE>
<TE>   2. THE ALLEY-OOP</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh game of the 2000 Western Conference finals
against Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, to O'Neal, to an off-court dance that nearly decapitated
everyone on the Laker bench.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the things these Lakers have accomplished since then, that
record 15-point comeback in the fourth quarter of Game 7 remains the
greatest.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the alley-oop gave the Lakers a six-point lead that
cemented a victory already earned, it will forever remain the
comeback's symbol.</TE>
<TE>   1. THE SHOT</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth game of the 2002 Western Conference finals
against Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   It was ... well, you know what it was.</TE>
<TE>   The most amazing thing about Horry's game-winning three pointer at
the buzzer wasn't the luck that brought him the ball, or the
experience that allowed him to drain it.</TE>
<TE>   It was how he looked afterward.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't jump. He didn't gesture. He didn't even smile.</TE>
<TE>   He simply put his hands behind his back and glared, at the Kings,
at the rest of the league, at the national television audience, at
anyone who would dare think these Lakers weren't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I haven't really thought about what that shot meant
until now," said a drenched Horry while standing amid the Lakers'
championship celebration Wednesday night in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   He paused. He looked around. His eyes widened, as if he had just
sunk it again.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Man," he said. "Man!"</TE>

<DH>Lakers weren't at their best against Trail Blazers until it
mattered the most in Game 3</DH>

<LD>The Lakers weren't exactly ordinary against the Portland Trail
Blazers. Let's just say they opened the playoffs with two rather
uneven performances in two victories against their favorite
postseason punching bags.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever the Lakers needed a key basket, they got one in Games 1
and 2 of the best-of-five series. Whenever they needed a critical
defensive stop, they got one. When all else failed, the Trail
Blazers' lack of composure helped get the Lakers by during two
unremarkable victories before mildly amused crowds at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Game 3, in a raucous environment at the Rose Garden.</LD>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers surged, but the Lakers stayed within striking
distance.</TE>
<TE>   Portland delivered its best shot, but the Lakers absorbed it.</TE>
<TE>   Blazer Maniacs bellowed for a victory, but the Lakers would not
allow it.</TE>
<TE>   Down, but not out, the Lakers gathered themselves one final time
near the end of Game 3. Portland led, 91-89, with seconds to play
when the Lakers came up with a play that would set the tone for their
run to the three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   Or more to the point, Kobe Bryant and Robert Horry would set the
groundwork for a postseason based more on substance than style. They
hooked up for the winning three-point basket, putting away the Trail
Blazers for the third consecutive spring.</TE>
<TE>   That Bryant and Horry would team up for the winning hoop should
not have been surprising. It was the newfound depth of Bryant's game
that amazed Kobe-watchers. Instead of forcing a shot in the face of a
Portland double-team, Bryant smartly passed the ball from the paint
to the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Horry, stationed in the right-hand corner, made a three-point
basket that was contested only by Portland point guard Damon
Stoudamire, who charged at him from his spot on the Trail Blazer
bench, bellowing in Horry's ear as he released the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Swish.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cash," Bryant would later say. "He's done it so many times.
It is cash."</TE>
<TE>   More than Shaquille O'Neal's brutish play in the lane against Dale
Davis, more than Bryant's highlight-reel moves around the basket,
more than the Trail Blazers' lack of poise when things turned against
them, the defining moment of the Lakers' first-round victory was
Bryant's willingness to pass instead of shooting.</TE>
<TE>   That has not often been the case. Bryant doesn't have a reputation
as a player who looks to pass, no matter how open his teammates
happen to be. He's a shooter, a scorer. He was going against form on
April 28.</TE>
<TE>   When Ruben Patterson, the self-proclaimed "Kobe-stopper," cut off
Bryant's drive and Scottie Pippen abandoned Horry to make it a
textbook double-team, Bryant made a mature decision to give up the
ball for the good of the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers rejoiced with 2.1 seconds to play, but the Trail
Blazers had one more chance to win and force Game 4. After a timeout,
they inbounded the ball at half court. But an alert Horry intercepted
Pippen's errant pass.</TE>
<TE>   Game over.</TE>
<TE>   Series over.</TE>
<TE>   These weren't exactly harrowing moments, certainly not when
compared to the tension-filled sequences to come. But the final
seconds of Game 3 seemed to harden the Lakers for the more determined
opponents that followed the Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   This was by no means a riveting series. In fact, it was all but
over during a 27-second span in Game 2, when Davis drew two technical
fouls and punted the ball into the seats, frustrated at having to
contend with O'Neal in the post.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson committed a flagrant foul against O'Neal in the same
game and Pippen and Bonzi Wells fouled out, underscoring the Trail
Blazers' inability to keep their emotions in check.</TE>
<TE>   That set the stage for an expected thumping in Game 3 that never
materialized. The Trail Blazers composed themselves and gave the
Lakers fits until Bryant found Horry and Horry found the bottom of
the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Horry's presence in the series had been something of a surprise.
He had been diagnosed 10 days before Game 3 with a hematoma, a
pooling of blood, beneath his abdominal muscles, and it was uncertain
how much he would play against Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Horry would play 89 minutes, all in a reserve role, making two of
eight three-point shots en route to averaging 6.3 points. He also
would give the Lakers much-needed defensive support on Rasheed
Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker replaced Horry at power forward in the Laker
starting lineup, but he didn't stay there long in the next round,
yielding to Horry during the conference semifinals against the San
Antonio Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line against Portland was that the Lakers found ways to
win. They weren't at their best, particularly because of injuries to
Horry and a number of nagging ailments for O'Neal, but they did what
was necessary to subdue the Trail Blazers and advanced to face the
Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers deserved high marks precisely because they made the
most of what was available against Portland.</TE>
<TE>   They received no style points for plentiful lapses in effort and
concentration, however.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, they got what they needed from the Trail Blazers:
three quick victories and a six-day rest before starting the next
round. Horry and O'Neal had an opportunity to rest and recover, the
better to prepare for Tim Duncan and the Spurs.</TE>

<KH>ROAD TO CHAMPIONSHIP WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS VS. SACRAMENTO</KH>
<HD>Rivalry Royale</HD>
<DH>Laker-King series had it all--bad food, bad officiating,
clutch shots and a classic Game 7</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>True greatness is not achieved in solitude.</LD>
<LD>   Would Muhammad Ali enjoy such an exalted status without Joe
Frazier or George Foreman in the ring to provide his defining tests?
Wasn't getting to the moon before the Soviets just as important as
landing there at all?</LD>
<LD>   During the Western Conference finals, the Lakers discovered their
worthy adversary. Everything developed quickly in this series, like
time-lapse photography. And by the end the Lakers had a rival not
just for now, but the future as well.</LD>
<TE>   Along the way we saw the formation of a star in Mike Bibby. We saw
another chapter in the tragic hero odyssey of Chris Webber, while the
happy-go-lucky career of Robert Horry reached a zenith.</TE>
<TE>   There were sinister motives assigned to everything from the sound
of an official's whistle to a tray of food.</TE>
<TE>   As is always the case, the central Laker figures were Shaquille
O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   But when it mattered most--just as it always seemed to be with
Jackson's Chicago Bull teams--the supporting cast ascended to heights
worthy of the stars.</TE>
<TE>   It was complete, as thoroughly satisfying a series as one could
be.</TE>
<TE>   And it was stylish as well. Like the neo-soul singers rescuing R&amp;B
from uninspired music, this series was part of the NBA's emergence
from the drudgery that bogged it down during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The winning team scored at least 100 points in five of the seven
games. Neither team scored fewer than 90 points in any of the games.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this series will always be known for its wildly
inconsistent officiating. In Game 1, Bryant's elbow caught Sacramento
guard Doug Christie in the nose as Bryant turned and swung the ball.
Christie was called for a foul, the most ridiculous of all of the 25
fouls on the Kings, versus 20 called on the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 2, O'Neal was cruising toward a potential 50-point night
until he picked up his third foul with 4:49 left in the half, and
afterward he all but said the referees had cheated the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 4, the Kings had the most legitimate complaint of all. An
unlikely three-pointer by Samaki Walker just before halftime proved
to be essential to the Lakers' one-point victory. But replays showed
Walker had shot after the buzzer. NBA officials watching a
frame-by-frame review later determined the shot was seven-hundredths
of a second too late--a fitting margin for the closeness of this
series.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers fumed after Game 5, when Sacramento shot 33 free throws
and O'Neal shot only one before fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   Game 6 inspired a national debate on the state of NBA officiating.
The Lakers, playing at home, shot 40 free throws--27 in the fourth
quarter--whereas the Kings shot only 25 free throws. The Lakers
converted an unusually high 85% of their free throws, crucial points
in a 106-102 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman couldn't let it go. Even after Game
7 he was still lamenting the calls in Game 6. Consumer advocate Ralph
Nader joined the protest, sending a letter to NBA Commissioner David
Stern.</TE>
<TE>   But that lingering sense of bitterness will only serve to make the
rivalry better in the future. Because the only thing worse than
watching a team you hate get what you want is watching a team you
hate get what you feel is rightfully yours.</TE>
<TE>   Few observers outside Sacramento thought the Kings could win the
series before it started.</TE>
<TE>   Game 1 seemed to confirm that school of thought. The Lakers jumped
to a 36-22 lead in the first quarter, playing their most complete
12-minute stretch of the playoffs. They coasted to a 106-99 victory
and they appeared to have the Kings in their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Lakers just owned this team. They proved once again
that Arco Arena, the loudest venue in the NBA, didn't affect them.
They continued a mastery of the Kings that included three victories
in four games during the regular season, plus six consecutive
victories in playoff games over three years.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the series turned during the day off, when Bryant
looked at the Sacramento Hyatt's room service menu and selected the
bacon cheeseburger and a slice of cheesecake.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant became violently ill, apparently the result of food
poisoning. One of the most memorable lines of the series was uttered
by Laker trainer Gary Vitti, describing Bryant when Vitti arrived in
his room: "He was doubled over like a shrimp."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and their fans wondered if it was merely coincidence
that the only reported problem among the 1,200 meals the hotel served
that day affected a Laker star.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was well enough to play 40 minutes for the Lakers, but he
made only nine of 21 shots and his 22 points weren't enough to
counterattack a Sacramento squad that produced 96.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Lakers had little reason to seem concerned. Their Game
1 victory had snatched the home-court advantage that Sacramento had
worked all season to get. They had shown they could stay within reach
of the Kings even on a slow night. And Bryant would have three days
to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Game 3, when the Kings turned all of those notions--and
the entire series--upside down. Bryant still looked weak; his early
shots struggled to get to the front of the rim and he missed 16 of
24. O'Neal had trouble establishing the inside position he'd enjoyed
in Sacramento. And the Kings' offense looked unstoppable. They would
lead for all but 13.1 seconds of the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento shot 49% and rolled to a 103-90 victory. And it took a
38-point fourth quarter from the Lakers, during which they made eight
three-point shots, just to make the final score that close.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are great front-runners. And with the lead in the
series, plus the knowledge that they had regained home-court
advantage, their confidence surged.</TE>
<TE>   They rolled out 40 points in the first quarter of Game 4 and
appeared to be toying with the Lakers. Bibby was hitting shots from
all over Staples Center. The Laker offense looked lost and Los
Angeles fell behind by 24.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers mounted a small rally, and Walker's three-pointer made
it a 14-point game at halftime. They got it to two inside the last 10
seconds, and you know the sequence by now. Bryant drove and missed.
O'Neal got the rebound and somehow missed from point-blank range.
Vlade Divac knocked the ball out toward half court, where Horry
collected it and let loose a three-pointer that hit nothing but net.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center went nuts. The Lakers celebrated like a high school
team that had won the state championship.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings weren't finished because Bibby wasn't done. And the
good part of the series was just getting started. Bibby made a
game-winning shot in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   After the contentious Game 6, Game 7 was nearly unblemished by the
officiating. They let the players play, and the result was a classic.
Every dribble seemed to ratchet up the tension. Of course, it went
into overtime. No one was ready to see it end.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby had another clutch performance, hitting big shots and the
two free throws that sent the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   But Webber shrank from the pressure. After having done a masterly
job of finding open teammates and scoring when necessary throughout
Game 6 and the first three quarters here, in crunch time he passed up
shots and let Bibby do the work. Webber looked awkward and indecisive
when he did shoot. He didn't take the Kings to the next level, the
way a player who signed a $122-million contract is supposed to.</TE>
<TE>   For the Lakers, meanwhile, O'Neal and Bryant combined for 65
points. But they had late-game contributions from Horry, Rick Fox and
Derek Fisher as well. All of the starters scored in double figures,
and all but Fisher had at least 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson coached more frantically than he usually does. But his
players exhibited the calm and poise in pressure situations that has
enabled them to win three consecutive championships.</TE>
<TE>   It took the great play of the Kings to bring it to the forefront.
Diamonds are created by pressure. Especially the diamonds on
championship rings.</TE>

<KH>ROAD TO CHAMPIONSHIP SECOND ROUND VS. SAN ANTONIO</KH>
<HD>Turning Up the Heat</HD>
<DH>Jackson got animated with Shaq, and Kobe left Spurs in
suspended animation</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal sliced open his left forearm while pretending to be
Spider-Man at home with his children on the morning of May 5.
Stitched and ready to take on the San Antonio Spurs in the Western
Conference semifinals, O'Neal promptly cut his right forefinger on
the rim and needed three more sutures before the day was done.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Kobe Bryant was accidentally kicked in the right knee
by San Antonio's pesky Bruce Bowen and limped off the floor to seek
medical treatment during Game 1 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about a 1-2 punch.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers would win, 86-80, but the bad omens were piling up fast
and there didn't seem much cause for celebration after their 20th
playoff victory in their last 21 games. The Lakers were bruised and
bloodied, and they still needed three more victories to advance to
the next round.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs were a formidable foe, a worthy adversary before the
Lakers' anticipated conference final showdown against the Sacramento
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Even taking into account the absence of center David Robinson,
whose injured back kept him from playing the first three games, the
Spurs were thought to be dangerous. After all, forward Tim Duncan had
been voted the league's most valuable player in a narrow victory over
New Jersey Net point guard Jason Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Things definitely got worse before they got better for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 2, they had to outscore the Spurs, 45-32, in the second
half simply to have a chance to win late. A suddenly demanding home
crowd, unaccustomed to such displays of vulnerability, booed the
Lakers for the first time in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, the swelling down in his bruised knee, fumbled the ball on
the Lakers' last possession and the Spurs gained control, holding on
for an 88-85 victory. Bryant scored 20 of his 26 points in the second
half but came up empty on his final drive.</TE>
<TE>   So, a split had cost the Lakers home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   And then things really turned sour.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson would later soften his statements, but on May
8, the day after the Lakers' loss in Game 2, he had what he called "a
heated conversation with Shaq, actually, about getting actively
involved in chasing the ball down."</TE>
<TE>   In Game 3, Jackson turned to bellow at O'Neal during a timeout,
but O'Neal twice waved him away in full view of 35,000 fans inside
the Alamodome. O'Neal, already with gashes on his arm and finger and
an arthritic right big toe that troubled him all season, had a new
injury, a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Still, O'Neal soldiered on, avoiding his coach's glare. He scored
22 points, took down 15 rebounds and added three assists in the
Lakers' 99-89 victory.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, the Lakers were back on track, although there were
still plenty of observers who believed the best they could hope for
was a split in San Antonio. O'Neal went into semi-seclusion during
the practice session between Games 3 and 4, inviting hand-picked
reporters into the training room for a brief conversation.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the stage was set for the pivotal moment of the series
late in Game 4. It would be Bryant, rather than O'Neal, who applied
the knockout blow to the Spurs, whose hopes of a 2-2 series tie
heading back to Los Angeles were vaporized by one scintillating play.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, trailing by 10 points with 4:55 remaining, took
advantage of the Spurs' woeful shooting in the fourth quarter to
begin a rally. (The Spurs would miss 15 of their last 18 shots.) The
Lakers drew even at 85-85 with 2:10 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Neither team could score until Bryant leaped above a crowd of
flat-footed Spurs to catch Derek Fisher's miss. Bryant touched down
only briefly, launching himself over Robinson and scoring the winning
points with 5.1 seconds remaining in an 87-85 victory that silenced
the Alamodome fans and the many critics who had been wondering if the
two-time defending champions would at last falter.</TE>
<TE>   The key to the play was that Bryant immediately sensed that
Fisher's shot was off target and charged from the right wing into the
paint, guessing correctly that the ball would be there when he
arrived. Bryant was off the floor before anyone else, hit the court
while everyone else was still in the air and was up again before
Robinson could get his hands up to deflect the shot.</TE>
<TE>   In a word, brilliant.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 5 at Staples, the Lakers started sluggishly, closed with a
10-4 run and took the deciding game from the deflated Spurs, 93-87.
Bryant scored 10 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter. Duncan was
tremendous in defeat, but scored only five of his 34 points in the
final quarter.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the series, the Lakers had outscored the Spurs,
125-88, in the fourth quarters of the five games. It was but one
indication of the Lakers' newfound resolve to do whatever was
necessary to win these tight games.</TE>
<TE>   Any boastfulness the Lakers might have felt they had earned with
their 15-1 romp to the title in 2001 was history. Swaggering was kept
to a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, this was still Bryant's team to lead. O'Neal was
hobbled by his injuries and not playing at peak efficiency, so it was
left to Bryant to save the Lakers with his brilliant play in Game 4.
In time, O'Neal would be fit again, poised to play his best
basketball in the later rounds.</TE>

<KH>ERA OF EXCELLENCE LOS ANGELES LAKERS (1979-91)</KH>
<HD>It Was Time for a Show</HD>
<DH>Lakers had a star center and a star guard (sound
familiar?), but Riley's gang featured much more</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY HARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The headline over a science story in The Times this week read, "In a
Universe of Wonders, Remembering to Be Awed." That reminded me of a
conversation I had when I covered the Showtime Lakers 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Dwyre, the sports editor, summoned me to his office one day
and warned me about my cynicism, borne no doubt of covering too many
Cub games for a Chicago newspaper. He told me to maintain a critical
eye but also to make sure that I provided readers with a sense of how
special that team was. I should, in short, remember to be awed.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't difficult. With Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
it seemed at the time that the Lakers had the basketball equivalent
of Ruth and Gehrig.</LD>
<TE>   There was a question in the early '80s about whether it was
Kareem's team or Magic's team, but it was clear not much longer into
the decade that it was Magic's.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar was "Cap" to his teammates, an acknowledgment of his
role as the captain and, I assume, his stature in the game.</TE>
<TE>   But Pat Riley told me once that the players thought Abdul-Jabbar,
because of his appearance on the court--his height, the way he
flapped his arms when he ran, his aviator goggles--and his
standoffish demeanor off the court, was goofy. That was his word.
Goofy.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates used to enjoy games more when he wasn't in them,
because of an injury or one of his frequent migraines. Riley called
them "the Greyhounds" because, without having to wait for
Abdul-Jabbar to set up the offense, they could run for 48 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they had to have known in their heart of hearts that
they wouldn't win as many titles as they eventually
did--five--without him. He had the greatest offensive weapon in the
game's history, the unblockable sky hook, and used it to become the
NBA's all-time leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   His rebounding was often criticized, not unfairly. Annual stories
in the Herald-Examiner quoting Wilt Chamberlain on that subject
infuriated Abdul-Jabbar so much that he stopped talking to the
paper's beat writer, Rich Levin.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar, though, was underappreciated defensively. His role
in initiating the heralded Laker fastbreaks with blocked or altered
shots was often obscured by the resultant coast-to-coast charge of
the lighter brigade that almost invariably ended with a basket after
a brilliant pass by Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   What more can be said about Magic? He hardly ever failed to live
up to his nickname. Almost nightly, he did something that I had never
seen anyone, including him, do before.</TE>
<TE>   Some teammates, Norm Nixon in particular, weren't as convinced as
the fans were when Johnson arrived in 1979 that he was the miracle
child. Ironically, he won over teammates in the same moment that he,
at least temporarily, lost many fans.</TE>
<TE>   That was on the night in 1981 in Salt Lake City that he demanded
to be traded because he didn't believe either he or the Lakers could
reach their potential with the half-court offense coach Paul Westhead
was trying to teach them. Westhead was fired the next day and
Johnson, as the inmate who supposedly was running the asylum, was
booed, even in the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   The fans eventually forgot, but Johnson's teammates didn't. Most
of them didn't like Westhead's system, either, but they didn't say
anything publicly for fear of the backlash. It was a different time,
and they didn't know how it would be received if black players
criticized a white coach.</TE>
<TE>   So Johnson did it for them. One reason was that he could. Jerry
Buss wasn't going to fire him. The other reason was that he knew it
was his responsibility if he wanted to become the team leader, which,
by virtue of his action, he did on that night in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates would follow him anywhere, a faith rewarded most
definitively a few years later when he led them down the fire escape
after their Philadelphia hotel almost went up in smoke.</TE>
<TE>   One question that comes up a lot these days is whether the
Kobe-Shaq Lakers could beat the Kareem-Magic Lakers. It's possible if
it were a two-on-two game and they were the only ones playing.</TE>
<TE>   But the Showtime Lakers had incredible depth and would have won a
series between them, in five or six games I believe, because of that.
The 1982-83 Lakers had Michael Cooper, James Worthy and Bob McAdoo on
the bench. Think about that.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar couldn't have stopped Shaquille O'Neal and vice
versa. Cooper, the defender Larry Bird respected more than any other,
would have done better than any of today's defenders on Kobe Bryant,
particularly when you consider Bryant would have been drained from
guarding Johnson. Who else would you have do it? The 6-foot-1 while
standing on a phone book Derek Fisher?</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of the current Lakers' competitiveness,
particularly during the Sacramento series, and you can't argue with
their playoff tenacity. But they don't provide the same value to
ticket buyers during the regular season as Showtime's Lakers did.</TE>
<TE>   I never saw them take a night off. Because of the grinding travel
schedule, and maybe because of extracurricular activities that came
to light after Johnson's HIV diagnosis, they weren't always sharp in
every game. But I never thought it was because of a lack of effort.</TE>
<TE>   Those Lakers wanted to win every time out, even if the game wasn't
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   After The Times' Steve Springer, covering for the Orange County
Register at the time, beat McAdoo in table tennis one night in
Richfield, Ohio, McAdoo bought a Ping-Pong table for the game room in
his apartment complex in West L.A. and practiced all summer for a
rematch.</TE>
<TE>   McAdoo was derided in Boston for not playing the Celtic way, but
he was a determined Laker, never backing down from anything. He was
so convinced that he was the best player on the team in every sport,
from bowling to yachting, that Johnson once said, "Anything you do,
Doo do better."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson got the better of Riley when they were rival coaches
in the Eastern Conference. But Jackson's Chicago Bulls had Michael
Jordan and Scottie Pippen and Riley's New York Knicks had Patrick
Ewing and John Starks. I'd like to see Riley against Jackson in a
fair fight.</TE>
<TE>   To Riley's credit, even after he was promoted from assistant to
head coach 12 games into the 1981-82 season, he defended Westhead.
Riley appreciated Westhead's offense, believing the Lakers needed to
learn it in case they found themselves mired in a half-court game, as
they had the season before in losing a first-round playoff series
against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Riley installed the offense before the playoffs in '82, but in
bits and pieces instead of all at once so that the players hardly
cared or even noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the short time Riley had spent as a sidekick to Chick
Hearn, Larry Brown said in '82 that coaches should be embarrassed
because "a broadcaster" had won the title.</TE>
<TE>   That was as unfair as any comment I've ever heard. I'm not sure
when Riley ever slept. When he wasn't watching films after games, he
was on the phone with his psychologist-wife, Chris, talking about his
relationship with his players. They had a lot to talk about.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon was the most tempestuous player and frequently challenged
Riley. I asked Riley once why he put up with it.</TE>
<TE>   "Because if I break him in the locker room, I might break him on
the court," Riley said. "I don't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon is still dogged. I saw him a couple of years ago at the
Kentucky Derby and, 17 years after the fact, he asked me why I'd
written that the Lakers had done the right thing in trading him for
Byron Scott in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Because Nixon's best position was point guard, where the Lakers
had Johnson, and because his knees were almost shot. Scott was a
young off-guard. But I conceded that the Lakers probably wouldn't
have lost in the 1984 Finals against Boston if Nixon had been there
with his experience and fire. Then again, maybe they wouldn't have
won in '85 if not for Scott's outside shooting.</TE>
<TE>   If the Rileys' phone bills were exorbitant, no doubt it was
because they spent so much time discussing Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't mind coming off the bench, as long as he knew he was
going to get his minutes. Once, when he didn't during the first half
of a game in Detroit, he told Springer and me that he wanted to talk
to us immediately after the game.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time we got to his locker, the trainer, Jack Curran,
had already talked him off the ledge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just ... hey, Jack, what's that word you used?" Cooper said,
yelling across the room to Curran.</TE>
<TE>   "Paranoid," Curran said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Cooper said, "paranoid."</TE>
<TE>   He remains the only Laker ever voted defensive player of the year.
The only shooting guard or small forward he couldn't guard was Walter
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   After a playoff game once in Phoenix, Riley congratulated Cooper
on the game he'd had against Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "But Pat," I said, "you had Nixon on Davis most of the game."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Riley said, winking, "but Coop doesn't know that."</TE>
<TE>   Levin used to carry a screw with him. When Cooper would start on
one of his rants, Levin would dig into his pocket, pull out the screw
and say, "Coop, here's your loose screw."</TE>
<TE>   One thing that both L.A. Laker dynasties had going for
them--besides Hearn--was that Jerry West built them. Now that he's
gone to Memphis, you have to wonder if there will be a Mitch Kupchak
dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   If there isn't, it won't be because Kupchak is less committed to
winning. I'll never forget the '85 Finals, when Kupchak, by then a
slow and earthbound but gritty reserve power forward, was knocking
Celtics all over the parquet floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Mitch, what are you doing?" an exasperated Kevin McHale asked him
at one point in a game in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Bird was disgusted by the question because the answer was so
obvious to him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing for the championship," Bird said.</TE>

<HD>Afghan President-to-Be Vows to Persevere in War on Terror</HD>
<DH>Asia: Karzai's remarks a day after his selection appear
aimed at lifting his nation's hopes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Incoming President Hamid Karzai vowed Friday to seat a multiethnic
government that reflects the diversity of this nation and pledged to
carry on with the U.S.-led war against terrorism until those who
"hurt mankind" are defeated.</LD>
<LD>   A day after being overwhelmingly chosen by a grand assembly as
Afghanistan's transitional head of state, Karzai praised his fellow
citizens for putting on "a real show of democracy" with the
gathering, which is charting the nation's escape from 23 years of war
and isolation.</LD>
<LD>   His confidence about the future in the face of widespread poverty,
distrust and anger appeared an attempt to infuse Afghans with hope
that their vulnerability to warlords and corruption will end soon now
that his leadership has the legitimacy of popular, if indirect,
endorsement.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai, who has been interim prime minister for the last six
months, will assume the presidency in August.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-year-old nobleman called on the allies who have pledged
$4.5 billion in reconstruction assistance to come through with the
money so his people can see a tangible reward for renouncing
bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective is to take Afghans to a better life, out of this
quagmire of 23 years, a quagmire of warlordism, terrorism and
hunger," Karzai told a news conference in the presidential palace.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, he said, "our people want dignity."</TE>
<TE>   International aid officials have estimated that it will cost $15
billion to repair the war-ravaged infrastructure of the country.
Karzai complained that even the assistance already pledged has been
slow to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of aid received is minimal in comparison to the level
of aid promised, and I want to go back to the international community
... to ask for stronger, more effective and speedy delivery of aid to
Afghanistan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in the traditional black turban and tunic of ethnic Pushtuns,
Karzai swept through a day of public appearances, congratulatory
receptions and media meetings to outline his plans for recovery and
reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has been credited with keeping a lid on ethnic
tensions during his term as interim prime minister, his
Cabinet--dominated by minority Tajiks and Uzbeks--has been widely
criticized for its ties with the Northern Alliance. The
warrior-ministers for foreign affairs, defense and the interior came
from the ranks of those who inflicted extensive suffering and
sometimes committed atrocities during more than two decades of
strife, though the forces also are recognized as having helped
liberate the country last fall from the repressive Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai declined to give specifics of the new slate of government
ministers he would like to see appointed and was vague about whether
the more than 1,500 delegates to the grand assembly, or loya jirga,
would have a say in the key selections.</TE>
<TE>   "The government will be representative," he said. "It has to be.
It has to represent the Afghan interests as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   A top priority for his administration, he said, will be
reestablishing trade links among the country's widely separated
regional centers.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have roads for the people so they can communicate and
do business," he said in ticking off the specifics he wants to see in
spending the promised foreign aid.</TE>
<TE>   He also denounced corruption as a dispiriting scourge of a
suffering nation and vowed that "this menace must go away."</TE>
<TE>   The president-to-be--who apparently plans no formal inauguration,
as he proclaimed himself already serving as head of state--was asked
about his outlook on the delicate issue of balancing justice and
national reconciliation. He made clear that those guilty of
widespread human rights violations will be held accountable. But he
also said that preserving peace has to be a higher priority.</TE>
<TE>   "We might have to have first peace and stability and a strong
Afghanistan and then give the people of Afghanistan the justice they
want," Karzai told journalists. "Do we have the luxury of having both
together? If we do, that's great. Let's see."</TE>
<TE>   The fight against Al Qaeda and other terrorist remnants in his
country will be a priority, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This fight will go on in the same strong manner as we were doing
in the past six months and against all those people who are up there
to hurt mankind," Karzai said, promising vigilance "until they are
absolutely ... finished."</TE>
<TE>   While Karzai was disseminating his message to the world's media,
the loya jirga delegates went on with their lively debate, which was
expected to continue through the weekend. After being silenced and
sidelined for so many years under the Taliban and under the Soviet
occupation before it, Afghans have been relishing their opportunities
to address the assembly, denouncing their nation's ills and proposing
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The convocation succeeded in getting the name of the new
leadership changed to reflect the Muslim population. It will be known
as the Transitional Islamic Government of Afghanistan, although
proposals to invoke Islamic Sharia law fell short of passage.</TE>
<TE>   The delegate who nominated Karzai a day earlier urged him to
remain humble and in touch with the people. Sheh Mohammed Asef
Mohsani suggested that the president-to-be eat only dry bread one day
each week.</TE>
<TE>   "You must feel the hunger of the poor," he said.</TE>

<HD>Failing Turkish Students Get Police Protection</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities in eastern Turkey have set up a hotline and are providing
police escorts for schoolchildren who do poorly in their annual
reports and fear punishment at home, officials said.</LD>

14-year-old boy as he escaped across the Berlin Wall four decades
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting had escalated into a dramatic confrontation, nine
months after East Germany's Communist rulers built the wall to stop a
drain of people to West Germany.</LD>
<LD>   The ex-guards faced charges of attempted manslaughter in the 1962
shooting of Wilfried Tews, who requires special shoes to walk as a

<HD>Rebels Attack Military Base in Republic of Congo; 60 Killed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo</DL>
<LD>Rebels on Friday launched their first attack on Brazzaville since
restarting this West African nation's civil war in March, and an army
spokesman said 52 rebels, four army officers and four civilians were
killed.</LD>
<LD>   State radio said at least 37 civilians were injured by cross-fire.
Government troops and the rebels fought with automatic arms and
heavier weapons at the southern end of the capital city, as hundreds
of residents fled, carrying suitcases and mattresses.</LD>
<LD>   The firing began about 3 a.m., but calm had returned by
midmorning.</LD>
<TE>   Army officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels
had targeted the city's main military base, not far from the Maya
Maya international airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ninjas' objective was to destroy our attack helicopters," one
officer said. "But they failed; none of the aircraft were touched."</TE>
<TE>   Led by a renegade pastor, Frederic Bitsangou, the rebels call
themselves the Ninjas after the ancient Japanese warriors. They are
demanding a role in military and political decisions and have refused
to abide by a 1999 cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Residents saw armed Ninja militia members stripped to the waist,
wearing what they believe are magic charms around their necks in an
attempt to ward off bullets. Some government loyalists fought in
jeans and T-shirts, their faces smudged with charcoal.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels launched attacks March 29--just two weeks after
elections ratified President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's hold on power,
which he took by force in 1997.</TE>

<HD>Peruvian Cabinet OKs Request to Extradite Fujimori</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru</DL>
<LD>The Peruvian government said Friday that the Cabinet had approved a
formal request to extradite former President Alberto Fujimori from
Japan on murder charges, and was translating the 600-page document to
send to Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   In a resolution published in the official gazette and signed by
President Alejandro Toledo, the government acknowledged its biggest
hurdle--that the two countries have no extradition treaty. But it
appealed to international law, which recognizes human rights crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Fujimori, who ruled the poor Andean nation with an iron fist from
1990 to 2000, denies all charges against him and says he would not
get a fair trial in Peru.</LD>
<TE>   He has Japanese as well as Peruvian citizenship, and Japan does
not as a rule extradite its nationals.</TE>
<TE>   Fujimori fled to Tokyo at the height of a corruption scandal in
November 2000 and was fired. He is wanted in Peru on charges of
murder--relating to two notorious massacres by a paramilitary an army
death squad in the early 1990s--as well as on separate corruption
charges.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Peru's attorney general charged Fujimori with
responsibility for the two massacres carried out by the Grupo Colina
death squad.</TE>
<TE>   Ministry officials said the government had no translator on staff
and expected that the translation could take two months.</TE>

<DH>South Asia: Rumsfeld's shuttle diplomacy does not deter
Indian and Pakistani shelling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Indian and Pakistani troops fired artillery into each other's
territory Friday, and six civilians were reported killed, despite
calls by the United States for an end to the shelling.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld shuttled between New
Delhi and Islamabad this week, pushing for a halt to all artillery
and mortar fire across the frontier in Kashmir, a region claimed by
both India and Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   Before leaving Islamabad on Thursday, Rumsfeld said such a lull
would "begin a process of easing some of the lingering hostilities"
between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   However, his call received a cool response from India and none
from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We examine all options and take action at an appropriate time,"
Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said Friday, when asked about
Rumsfeld's push for a halt to shelling. He said India had announced a
moratorium on all hostile action in November, but that the situation
had since changed.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee convened a meeting of
his Cabinet Committee on Security to review his discussions with
Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Between visits to the subcontinent by U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Richard L. Armitage last week and Rumsfeld this week--both
aimed at easing tensions between India and Pakistan--New Delhi lifted
a nearly six-month ban on Pakistani aircraft flying over Indian space
and pulled back warships from positions close to Pakistani waters.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a Pakistani navy spokesman said that Pakistan has
decided to recall its warships and submarines from undisclosed
locations.</TE>
<TE>   "Pakistan has made this decision as a gesture of goodwill to
India," Capt. Shahid Nabeel said by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Indian army officer in the Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir said Friday that there had been somewhat fewer militant
attacks since Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's assurance last
week that he had ordered his army to stop Kashmiri militants from
crossing the border to launch attacks in Indian territory.</TE>

<HD>Death Toll Rises to 10 in Blast at U.S. Consulate in
Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Police search for clues in the car bombing in Karachi
that injured 51, mostly passersby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>KARACHI, Pakistan -- The death toll climbed to at least 10 people
late Friday following a midmorning car bombing outside the U.S.
Consulate here. Police cordoned off a large area and began combing
the carnage and debris for clues to the blast, which left 51 others
injured and Pakistan's largest city bleeding from yet another
terrorist atrocity.</LD>
<LD>   None of the dead were Americans, and only six of the wounded were
inside the consulate compound when the blast occurred.</LD>
<LD>   One Pakistani police officer on guard outside the consulate was
among the dead, but many of those killed were simply pedestrians or
people in vehicles who happened to be in the area at the time of the
explosion.</LD>
<TE>   A statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, the capital,
said five Pakistani consular employees and a U.S. Marine guard were
slightly wounded by flying debris.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on Islamic militants who
are known to be active in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   A local English-language newspaper, the News, received a fax late
Friday purportedly from an unknown group calling itself Al
Qanoon--"the Law"--claiming that it had carried out the bombing.
Police said they were attempting to determine the statement's
credibility. The fax, which was handwritten in the local Urdu
language, declared that the attack was the beginning of the group's
holy war in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "America, its allies and its lackey Pakistani rulers should be
prepared for more bomb attacks in the future," the note declared.</TE>
<TE>   Religious extremist groups in this South Asian nation view as
their enemy not just the United States but also Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf and his military government, which this year
launched a major crackdown against them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're passing through very difficult times," said Maj. Gen.
Rashid Qureshi, the Pakistani president's spokesman. "The task now is
to keep our nerve and defeat these terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, President Bush condemned the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "We fight an enemy that are radical killers, that's what they are.
You know, they claim they're religious people, and they blow up
Muslims. They have no regard for individual life," he said during a
brief visit to the Assn. for the Advancement of Mexican Americans
summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   "But these people, if they think they're going to intimidate the
United States, they do not understand the United States of America,"
he said. "And we will continue to hunt them down and seek justice."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the State Department said the U.S. Embassy in
Islamabad and consulates in the cities of Lahore and Peshawar, as
well as the one in Karachi, would be closed temporarily for an
emergency review of security procedures. Britain and the U.S. called
on their nationals to leave the country, as they have done in recent
weeks amid fears of increased terrorism and the threat of war between
India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also pledged to work "shoulder to shoulder" with
Musharraf and his nation to investigate the bombing and to continue
the broader war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue this close cooperation. We are working with the
government of Pakistan in its efforts to establish the identity of
the perpetrators and bring them to justice swiftly," State Department
spokesman Philip T. Reeker said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   A large squad of FBI agents from Los Angeles was dispatched to
Karachi to assist the bombing investigation and determine whether it
might be a precursor to future terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours after the bombing, members of a so-called Rapid
Deployment Team were notified that they would be sent to Pakistan.
The team is one of only three in the U.S. and includes scores of FBI
personnel--from counter-terrorism specialists and SWAT team members
to support staff workers--who are trained to respond anywhere in the
world after terrorist attacks on American interests.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be there to assist Pakistan authorities in their
investigation of this incident," said Los Angeles FBI spokesman
Matthew McLaughlin. "And as is the case with any investigation of
this nature, we will take it wherever it leads to see if it links to
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's blast was the third terrorist attack in as many months
directed against foreigners in Pakistan and the second in little more
than a month in Karachi. Another car bomb went off outside the
Sheraton Hotel and Towers only a few hundred yards from the U.S.
Consulate on May 8, killing 11 French defense contract workers in a
bus that was to have taken them to work.</TE>
<TE>   In March, an armed assault in Islamabad on a Protestant church
where most of the worshipers were foreigners killed five people,
including two Americans. Daniel Pearl, an American journalist with
the Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped in late January in Karachi and
later beheaded. The murder trial of a Muslim extremist accused of
organizing the kidnapping is in progress.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to initial reports that Friday's attack was carried out
by a suicide bomber who rammed the consulate wall, witnesses said
late Friday that traffic was moving normally along the busy divided
road that runs next to the consulate when a vehicle detonated. The
explosion occurred about 6 feet from the protective concrete wall
that serves as the consulate's outer perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Local law enforcement officials said they were ruling out nothing
during the initial stages of the investigation, though there was
little doubt that a bomb had caused the blast. While some talked of a
suicide bomb, there was also speculation that the explosive could
have been planted in a car and set off by remote control.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very early in our investigation, and we're keeping our mind
open until evidence leads us in a specific direction," said Syed
Kamal Shah, chief of police for Sindh province, which includes
Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   A small Suzuki commercial van was first believed to be the vehicle
carrying the bomb, but attention later in the day focused also on a
small Toyota sedan operated by a local driving school for women.
Police said the car was known to make frequent trips by the
consulate, which is located between the driving school and a local
license testing center.</TE>
<TE>   The car's three occupants--two women, ages 20 and 19, and the
38-year-old school owner, Faruhanda Jabeen--were among those killed
in the attack. Police said their bodies were blown apart.</TE>
<TE>   Shah said investigators had yet to determine decisively which
vehicle carried the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "Those two were the ones worst affected by the explosion," he
said. "We're examining parts from both vehicles closely."</TE>
<TE>   The force of the blast was enormous.</TE>
<TE>   It left a 3-foot-deep crater in the roadway, tore out a 25-foot
section of the consulate's protective wall and blew out windows of
the facility and other buildings within a quarter-mile radius of the
explosion. Auto parts, believed to have come from whichever vehicle
contained the bomb, shot skyward before raining down over a park
across from the consulate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Consul General John K. Bauman, who lives beyond the park
nearly a quarter of a mile from the consulate, said two tie rods from
an automobile engine landed on his property. One hit the driveway,
narrowly missing a gardener; the second landed on the roof. The
street outside the consulate was strewn with debris and the wreckage
of several vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Among the clutter was a single toddler-sized gray leather sandal,
the fate of its owner unknown, although no children were believed to
be among the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Bauman, who was in the consulate at the time of the explosion,
said the building "was rocking."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, a counter-terrorism exercise had been planned for
11:30 a.m. at the consulate, about 20 minutes after the bombing.</TE>

<HD>Where 'Thorn Birds' Could Have Kept Flying</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The TV miniseries genre is flourishing in
China. Advertisers and viewers have come to expect at least 20
episodes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Everyone knows that attention spans are getting shorter these days,
thanks in part to television. But don't try making that claim in
China, where TV itself offers almost frightening evidence to the
contrary.</LD>
<LD>   This country might be the world champ when it comes to a genre now
out of favor in media-saturated America: the TV miniseries.</LD>
<LD>   We're not talking about wimpy little four-part productions like
"The Thorn Birds." Forget the gusty "Winds of War." These are
marathon sessions, as befits a nation of 1.3 billion people, many of
whom take their TV-watching very seriously.</LD>
<TE>   Consider "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," now screening every weeknight
in millions of Chinese living rooms. It's an epic tale set during
China's Taiping Rebellion in the mid-19th century--so epic, in fact,
that it needs 46 episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Or try "Kelan, P.I.," a thriller set in 1930s Shanghai, about a
journalist-turned-detective who is falsely accused in a string of
brutal murders and fights to clear his name. Number of episodes: 28.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's "Strange Man, Strange Case," an "X-Files"-type drama:
35 episodes. "Elder Brother," about a troubled family: 20. "Loving
Care," a medical drama: 26. And much, much more.</TE>
<TE>   Miniseries clutter the Chinese TV schedule morning, noon and
night. Many become huge hits capable of launching unknown actors, and
even the singers who croon their theme songs, to fame and fortune.
Even a less successful miniseries can score millions of viewers,
given the overall size of China's population.</TE>
<TE>   Although the form is largely passe in the U.S., it maintains a
hold on viewers here for reasons ranging from the dearth of other
entertainment options to China's long love affair with episodic
storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   Widespread TV ownership is a relatively recent phenomenon in
China, a product of the country's market-oriented economic reforms of
the last two decades. TV sets can now be found in 350 million Chinese
households--more households than there are people in the entire U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Although city dwellers, especially young people, have plenty of
other choices for entertainment--nightclubs, bars, the Internet,
bowling alleys--watching TV remains a major leisure activity.</TE>
<TE>   In the countryside, home to the vast majority of Chinese, the tube
is the No. 1 pastime, partly because there isn't much else to do. The
experience is often a communal one. In poor areas, neighbors eager to
catch the latest installment of a show will crowd into the home of
the one person in the village who owns a TV. Even now in Beijing,
it's not uncommon on a summer's eve to find a TV put out in an
alleyway for residents to gather round to watch.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to capitalize on this audience are dozens of TV networks,
which put a premium on shows able to keep viewers tuning in night
after night.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the miniseries.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first to make it big was "Plainclothes Police," a
12-parter so successful when it aired in the mid-'80s that the man
who sang the theme song, Liu Huan, became an overnight pop sensation.</TE>
<TE>   The show spawned a host of imitators, which grew longer and longer
to keep viewers coming back again and again. Advertisers, who bought
rights to broadcast commercials per miniseries rather than per
episode, loved the trend: The more nights a miniseries spanned, the
more times their spots appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertisers won't like it if it's not a long series," said Ding
Hei, a director who is currently shooting a miniseries about police
and drug dealers, called "Jade Goddess of Mercy."</TE>
<TE>   "The way they look at it, a good miniseries will begin to attract
notice at about Part 4 or 5, then become really popular when you hit
Part 6 or 7," Ding said. "If it's only 11 parts in all, then there
are few episodes left, and the advertiser won't get as good a return
on his commercials."</TE>
<TE>   Because miniseries can generate so much ad revenue, the stakes are
high for China's television networks, which often engage in fractious
bidding wars for potential hits.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition is pretty excessive," said Yan Zongxiang, an
executive at one of China's provincial television stations. "A lot of
miniseries get made every year, but it's not easy to land the good
ones."</TE>
<TE>   The most popular programs these days are those that deal with
crime--especially official corruption, rampant in China--and family
crises, including unemployment and extramarital affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Another popular form is historical drama, complete with period
costumes and social commentaries that take oblique digs at
contemporary Chinese society.</TE>
<TE>   Famous film directors and actors are a plus, and not that rare to
find on TV, because unlike in the U.S., television in China is a
bigger vehicle to stardom than the silver screen. The tube is
practically universal, whereas cinemas are still an urban luxury.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the patience required of viewers to sit through a
30-part serial.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a good story, they'll follow it to the end," author
Hai Yan said.</TE>
<TE>   He should know. Six of Hai's novels, most of them crime stories
based on his experiences as a police officer, have been turned into
miniseries, including "Plainclothes Police" and "Jade Goddess of
Mercy." He has adapted many of them for the screen. Hai sees the
miniseries as the modern equivalent of China's lively oral
storytelling tradition.</TE>
<TE>   From imperial times through the middle of the 20th century, people
flocked to teahouses and public meeting spaces to hear storytellers
spin their yarns. These storytellers were masters of the cliffhanger;
they knew how to keep their audiences hooked.</TE>
<TE>   That tradition translates well into a TV miniseries, better than a
feature-length movie, Hai said.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinese people love watching stories [unfold]," he said. "The
stories are very complex, which the shorter length of films doesn't
always allow you to portray. The length of a miniseries lets you tell
an audience a complete story."</TE>
<TE>   Hai's "Jade Goddess of Mercy," now being shot, is a sordid tale of
sex, drugs, murder and betrayal that hops back and forth from Beijing
to Yunnan province in the southwest to locations in North America.
The script runs about 360,000 Chinese characters--10 times that of a
feature-length film.</TE>
<TE>   Production costs are set to exceed $1 million, on the top end for
a TV miniseries in China.</TE>
<TE>   The program's heroine is An Xin, a police officer who weds one
man, has an affair with another, then discovers that her illicit
lover is a drug dealer, whom she gets assigned to arrest. Revenge,
tragedy and other amorous entanglements ensue.</TE>
<TE>   An Xin is played by 20-year-old Sun Li, a virtual unknown from
Shanghai who said she was dumbfounded when the producers cast her in
the lead role.</TE>
<TE>   Sun prepped for her part for five months, visiting a police
station in Yunnan and learning taekwondo.</TE>
<TE>   If she's lucky, Sun's career will follow the same path as the
other unknown actresses who have starred in miniseries based on Hai's
books: instant stardom.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play the role well and become famous, but it's not
going to be decided by me," Sun said modestly one recent afternoon on
the set, in a cluttered Beijing apartment. "I hope viewers like An
Xin."</TE>
<TE>   They'll certainly have ample opportunity to decide: "Jade Goddess
of Mercy" spans 25 parts.</TE>

<HD>34 Detainees Flown From Afghanistan to Cuba Base</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba</DL>
<LD>The American military flew 34 more suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban
captives Friday from Afghanistan to this U.S. base, bringing the
prisoner population to 502, a U.S. official said.</LD>
<LD>   The prisoners were given medical screenings and showers and moved
into Camp Delta, the detention facility that replaced the makeshift
chain-link cells at Camp X-Ray in April, said Army Lt. Col. Joe Hoey,
a spokesman for the task force running the prison operation.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. military began bringing prisoners from Afghanistan to the
naval base in January and is holding about 150 more in Afghanistan.
Camp Delta can accommodate up to 612 prisoners.</LD>
<TE>   Their fate remains uncertain. President Bush has authorized
military tribunals that could try them, but none have been charged
with crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-terrorist effort continued elsewhere as well, with a
prosecutor saying that Belgium was investigating a possible link
between Al Qaeda and a diamond robbery at Brussels National Airport
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The proceeds worth some 253 million Belgian francs [$6.33
million] may have been used to finance a terrorist network," said Jos
Colpin, spokesman for the Brussels public prosecutor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Robbers stole five crates of diamonds from a Lufthansa aircraft
parked on the tarmac on Oct. 31, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Police are investigating a possible link to two suspected Tunisian
Al Qaeda members, Nizar Trabelsi and Fauze al Haddouti.</TE>
<TE>   They were arrested in a crackdown on Islamic militants after Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   Haddouti, Trabelsi and two others are suspected of planning
attacks on U.S. targets, including a plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy
in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Haddouti was released on bail in October, and Trabelsi is still in
custody. Both men are charged with involvement in organized crime.</TE>

<HD>Security Measures Served U.S. Consulate Well in Blast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN and TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If there was anything positive to be gleaned from Friday's explosion
outside a U.S. Consulate in Pakistan, it was that the many security
measures implemented over the years to protect those working inside
the facility appeared to serve their purpose.</LD>
<LD>   The blast in the city of Karachi killed at least 10 Pakistanis in
the street outside the fortified consulate and injured scores more.
But only five Pakistanis and a U.S. Marine inside the compound
received minor injures, despite the fact that 160 Pakistanis and 32
Americans work there.</LD>
<LD>   Reinforcements ordered after the 1998 bombings at the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania minimized the damage of the blast and
probably spared American lives, diplomatic officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "You know, we were very lucky," State Department spokesman Philip
T. Reeker said. "The blast was attenuated by precautions we've taken
in terms of security steps at our embassies."</TE>
<TE>   State Department policy forbids disclosure of the security
measures taken at specific consulates, but a source with knowledge of
the Karachi facility said the building's outer wall facing the road
where Friday's blast occurred had recently been reinforced.</TE>
<TE>   The windows of the consulate also had a new coating of protective
film that helped prevent the glass from shattering and injuring those
inside.</TE>
<TE>   The potential for injuries also was reduced because offices on the
side of the consulate where the blast occurred were unoccupied and
used instead for storage and occasional meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also had beefed up security around the perimeter of the
consulate by installing concrete and metal pillars and blast walls,
changing public access points and reinforcing a Marine security guard
booth.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly feel that upgrades undertaken in Karachi helped save
lives today," said a U.S. diplomatic security official who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   A team of structural engineers from the United States is due in
Karachi early next week to inspect the building, which was
temporarily closed Friday, and determine whether it can still be
used.</TE>
<TE>   Karachi has long been considered one of the State Department's
more dangerous postings. Anthony Buzzo, who served as a Marine guard
at the site in 1995 and 1996, when foreign oil workers and consular
employees in the region were slain, described the region Friday as a
lawless frontier. He recalled how Americans would invite him and his
colleagues to dinner because they felt safer with Marines around.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always been anti-American sentiment," said Buzzo, former
president of the Marine Embassy Guard Assn. "You get picked out as a
target just walking down the street."</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the security of diplomatic buildings has waxed and
waned since a Pentagon report recommended stronger measures in the
1970s but has increased overall since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for security personnel and operations rose from $409
million in fiscal 2001 to a $553-million request for 2003.
Expenditures for the "bricks and mortar" of physical security
increased from $662 million in fiscal 2001 to $816 million in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The money has paid for expanded security perimeters around
diplomatic buildings and for new guards. State Department officials
have hired 400 local guards and 518 new diplomatic security agents,
while hundreds more security personnel have been sent overseas
temporarily. New surveillance cameras, chemical equipment and armored
cars are among the items that have been bought for embassies since
1998.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomatic sites now have alarms and require vehicle
inspections. Other measures include more secure guard booths and
barriers to block car bombers. In some cases, local governments have
closed streets or moved traffic away from the American buildings. The
result is sometimes fortress-like structures with narrow slit windows
and massive walls surrounded by barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatic offices have been relocated to temporary sites in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania; Nairobi, Kenya; and Doha, Qatar. Meanwhile,
construction on new buildings is underway in Tanzania, the United
Arab Emirates, Kenya, Turkey, Tunisia and Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   Staffing of U.S. offices in Pakistan already had been reduced to
emergency levels in March, when the Bush administration warned
Americans not to travel to Pakistan.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Demands Expulsion of Iraqi From U.N.</HD>
<DH>Government: The State Department accuses the diplomat of
espionage but offers no details.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government accused a senior Iraqi diplomat at the United
Nations of espionage Friday and demanded that he be sent back to his
homeland.</LD>
<LD>   Abdul Rahman I.K. Saad, who holds the title of first secretary at
Iraq's U.N. mission, was formally accused of "activities incompatible
with his diplomatic status" in a State Department letter delivered to
the mission Friday, U.S. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Though the officials declined to specify what Saad's alleged
activities were, diplomats who asked not to be named said he had been
accused of attempting to recruit American citizens to provide Iraq
with intelligence information about U.S. government activities.</LD>
<TE>   Saad's actions were "deemed to be harmful to the United States,"
the State Department said in its letter.</TE>
<TE>   "For all intents and purposes, this is an expulsion," said a U.S.
official here, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi mission would offer no public comment on the U.S.
accusations, a diplomat there said Friday. But in a written response
to the State Department, the Iraqi government defended Saad's conduct
and asked the United States to substantiate its charges.</TE>
<TE>   "The permanent mission of Iraq considers the conduct and
activities of Abdul Rahman I.K. Saad to be within his official
capacity," the Iraqis wrote, according to U.S. diplomats who received
a copy of the letter in their offices here.</TE>
<TE>   Reminiscent of the Cold War era, the diplomatic move marks the
first time that the United States has officially sought the removal
of a U.N.-accredited diplomat since 1996, when Washington ordered a
Sudanese envoy out of the country, U.N. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the State Department letter, the U.S. government requested that
Saad leave the country by the month's end. Under U.N. rules, Iraq can
appeal the demand to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
supervises diplomatic accreditation here. But by precedent, Annan
would be expected to let the U.S. request stand, U.N. officials said.
And even if Annan were to rule in Iraq's favor, the United States
could still order Saad's expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Saad, who was posted to the U.N. mission less than a year ago, is
one of 16 Iraqi diplomats accredited here. The envoys to the world
body are the only Iraqi diplomats residing in the United States.
Washington broke off diplomatic relations with the Persian Gulf
nation in 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   As is the case with U.N. diplomats from Cuba, North Korea, Libya
and Iran, the Iraqis are prohibited by the U.S. government from
traveling more than 25 miles from New York and cannot engage in any
professional activities unrelated to their U.N. assignments.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a few Iraqi consular officials work in their
government's interests section in the Algerian Embassy. In 1994, the
State Department ordered the expulsion of the head of the Iraqi
interests section, accusing him of illegally lobbying Congress on
Iraq's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomatic confrontation here coincided with an escalation of
military tension between the United States and Iraq, as the Pentagon
announced Friday that U.S. and British warplanes had attacked an
Iraqi radar facility in Amarah, about 165 miles southeast of Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing raid was launched in retaliation for Iraqi
antiaircraft fire against U.S. and British planes patrolling a
"no-fly" zone imposed over southern Iraq, said U.S. military
spokesmen at the Central Command in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   An Iraqi military spokesman said in a statement carried by the
official Iraqi News Agency that the U.S. and British warplanes
carried out 42 sorties Friday from bases in Kuwait. "The enemy
attacked our civilian and service installations in Amarah," the Iraqi
spokesman said, according to a Reuters report from Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Bush administration advocates what it calls a "regime
change" in Baghdad, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in Canada
on Friday that there are no immediate U.S. plans to overthrow
President Saddam Hussein by force.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and other members of the U.N. Security Council recently
imposed new trade sanctions on Iraq and reiterated demands that
Hussein's government open its doors to U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri has held two rounds of talks
here this year about the possible return of the inspectors, who left
Iraq at the end of 1998. He is scheduled to meet again with Annan and
other U.N. officials in Vienna on July 4 and 5. But U.S. and European
diplomats at the world body say they expect the Vienna discussions to
be similarly inconclusive, and they anticipate requests from the
Iraqis for further negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that will get the inspectors back is the threat of
U.S. military action," said one senior European diplomat here, who
asked not to be named.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Close to Proposing Interim Palestinian State</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The plan for land held by Arafat hinges on an end
to attacks on Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to call for an interim
Palestinian state in a speech next week--possibly as early as
Tuesday--after final deliberations this weekend on his vision for
breaking the deadlock in the Middle East peace process, according to
U.S. and Middle East officials.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush's proposal for an interim state, basically occupying an
area no greater than the territory now controlled by the Palestinian
Authority, will depend heavily on an end to violence against Israel
and possibly other steps that Bush's foreign policy team will spend
the weekend debating, U.S. officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The idea behind an interim state is to generate hope among the
Palestinians and to undermine the belief among them that violence
against Israel is the only means to move to eventual creation of a
larger, permanent state, administration officials say.</LD>
<TE>   Creating the formal mechanisms of an interim state--including a
constitution, national assembly and judiciary--also could weaken the
decisive role Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has
played and disperse power among others, the officials say. That is a
major goal for both Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. officials, who are well placed to know administration
deliberations on the Middle East, all requested anonymity when
discussing the sensitive issue.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush's anticipated announcement, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell is expected to travel to the troubled region to consult with
Israelis, Palestinians and moderate Arab leaders in advance of an
international conference in July, according to U.S. officials and
Middle East envoys in Washington. A possible site for the conference
is Turkey, the officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Although the broad strokes of an administration peace proposal
have emerged after six weeks of talks between Bush and Middle East
leaders, the president's foreign policy team still has key
differences to settle before he takes what would be one of his
boldest steps in foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   The most contentious debate concerns how this new approach to the
peace process will unfold--and the split in Washington mirrors to a
certain degree the opposing positions in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on Thursday endorsed the
concept of an interim state. And Sharon, who earlier accepted the
principle of an eventual permanent Palestinian state, has not
rejected the interim proposal. But Israel first wants a strict
sequence of steps set up--beginning with strong action by the
Palestinians to end suicide bombings and other acts of violence,
according to Israeli envoys in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   That would be followed by major reforms of the Palestinian
Authority, the current governing structure. The final step would be
an interim state.</TE>
<TE>   "No right-minded Israeli official is going to agree to give more
political power to the Palestinian Authority ... when that body is as
it is today. It sponsors terrorism, is untrustworthy, and it doesn't
live up its commitments," an Israeli diplomat said. "No one will
agree to an interim or provisional state that is a mirror of what it
is today."</TE>
<TE>   The debate over what conditions or requirements should be imposed
on the Palestinians to achieve an interim state is "strenuous," said
a well-placed administration official. "How onerous those
requirements might be is not clear."</TE>
<TE>   Israel has strong backing in its position from Vice President Dick
Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, as well as from
congressional leaders, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   But the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco--backed
by the 22-nation Arab League--have pressed hard for simultaneous
progress on security measures and creation of an interim or permanent
Palestinian state. Powell and CIA Director George J. Tenet have
argued that the two phases should to some extent go hand in hand.</TE>
<TE>   The Arabs have also called for a timeline on the negotiation
process to put pressure on both sides to resolve differences and
provide hope for Palestinians that the political issues will not be
indefinitely in limbo. During talks with Bush last week, Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak called for a final settlement within two to
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, Rumsfeld and some members of the National Security Council
are dubious about a timeline. Powell, who has borne the brunt of
appeals from Arab leaders, also has concerns, but he wants some
mechanism to keep both sides focused on a final settlement and avoid
yet another deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an inherent aversion to timelines, and Powell shares it,"
said a State Department official. "There are lots of folks who
consider a timeline a built-in formula for failure. It dares both
sides not to comply with it."</TE>
<TE>   The borders of an interim state presumably would be the territory
the Palestinians now occupy--about 40% of the West Bank and
two-thirds of the Gaza Strip. Issues left undetermined would be the
borders of a permanent state, the status of Jerusalem--which both
sides claim as their capital--and the return of Palestinian refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is also expected to propose that the international conference
set up three committees to pursue discussions on political, security
and economic issues. The committees could include not only Israelis
and Palestinians but also top officials from moderate Arab regimes.</TE>
<TE>   A host of other issues are up for debate this weekend, including
what Bush should say about Jewish settlements in areas Palestinians
claim and a possible new assistance package to Israel to address its
economic woes and provide an incentive to cooperate, U.S. officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   In the region, the idea of an interim state has already sparked
controversy and skepticism on both sides. The Palestinians were the
first to challenge the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot accept any more interim and temporary solutions. We
must reach a final solution," said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian peace
negotiator and Cabinet minister, in an interview printed Friday in
the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds.</TE>
<TE>   Key Israelis also might balk. Although Sharon has accepted the
idea of an eventual Palestinian state, the governing Central
Committee of his Likud Party has opposed it. Sharon also wants
negotiations only after Arafat is confined to a ceremonial role.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the idea of the prime minister to reach an arrangement step
by step," Communications Minister Reuven Rivlin, a Sharon confidant,
said Friday. "This [U.S.] plan would face a lot of problems within
Israeli public opinion, because if it happens, it may force the
evacuation of some settlements. That could cause an ideological
dispute between left and right."</TE>
<TE>   The advantage a U.S. plan would hold for both sides is that it
would come from neither of them. Arafat, with his security forces in
disarray, might be tempted to accept an American proposal as a way
out of a deadlock with Israel that has defied solution for nearly two
years, analysts in the region said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon too is feeling pressure as the Israeli economy suffers
under the security burden imposed by the fight with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Powell publicly broached the idea of an interim state in an
interview this week with the Arab world's leading newspaper, Al
Hayat, which is based in London. He used the term "provisional" to
describe it, but the administration has opted for an interim state to
make clear that such an entity would be considered a "way station" en
route to a permanent state and final resolution of the
half-century-old conflict, said the well-placed administration
source.</TE>
<TE>   A provisional state sounds too open-ended, said the source,
adding: "Interim captures the flavor we're looking for."</TE>

<HD>Hotel Wave Hits Coastal Southland</HD>
<DH>Tourism: With 27 new resorts opening, will there be enough
guests in the $250-and-up rooms?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Surf &amp; Sand Resort in Laguna Beach--where every room fronts
the ocean, the pool and spa sit on the seashore and rates start at
$375 per night--general manager Blaise Bartell is guarding what has
long been a top attraction in the luxury hotel market.</LD>
<LD>   If not for the unusual number of high-end hotels being developed
up and down Southern California's coast, Bartell probably would not
be spending millions in upgrades, from pillow-top mattresses to a new
$1.5-million spa.</LD>
<LD>   But all around him, new competitors are looming. By next summer,
more than 4,200 new hotel rooms will be open in Orange and San Diego
counties, with nearly half falling in the upscale category--$250 or
more per night.</LD>
<TE>   "Bottom line is we have to spend every penny we can right now just
to stay in the game," Bartell said of the improvements that so far
have cost about $6 million. "We simply do not have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   The building boom is an unprecedented expansion of Southern
California's beach resort industry. Although an icon of movies and
the inspiration for the "surf" music of the 1960s, the Southland's
beaches never have been in the same league with such elegant tourist
destinations as Waikiki, Miami Beach or the Hamptons.</TE>
<TE>   That perception soon could change, especially along the 100-mile
stretch of coast south of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   When the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort opened last summer in Dana
Point, it broke a 10-year dry spell in luxury hotel development. By
this time next year, 27 more upscale hotel properties either will be
open or under construction.</TE>
<TE>   And while most of these future resorts are aimed at Southern
Californians looking for deluxe weekend escapes, some believe the new
hotels will strengthen the region's appeal as a first-class resort
destination. State tourism officials already plan to highlight the
area in advertising campaigns next year, touting the development
along Southern California's "new Riviera."</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, everyone will be marketing Southern California's luxury
beach resorts and there'll be a buzz about the area like we've never
experienced before," predicted John Dravinski, general manager of the
Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel. "It'll be like a siren going off,
instead of a little bell."</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of skepticism about how well the market will
manage such a rapid growth spurt, as luxury resort vacations aren't
likely to supplant Disneyland and Hollywood as the region's top
tourist draws. But developers are banking on baby boomers to keep
doling out their discretionary income on lavish vacations--despite
the cloudy economy and overall travel downturn. They hope the surge
in new resorts will lure more visitors to the coast for longer
stretches, especially if travelers are looking for respites closer to
home.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, though, hotel operators are scrambling to spruce
up their properties, with several planning to complete upgrades
before year's end in an attempt to keep guests from booking at the
newer properties.</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Cliffs Marriott Resort at Dana Point, perched on a
bluff above Dana Point Harbor, recently finished a $7.5-million
renovation that included room improvements and expansion of meeting
facilities. The Inn at Laguna, a 70-room oceanfront boutique hotel,
spent $2 million on room upgrades and landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Ritz-Carlton, which opened in 1984 and is largely
credited with enhancing south Orange County's beach resort status, is
polishing itself in anticipation of the newcomers. Dravinski said the
hotel is spending about $30 million to expand the fitness and massage
center, build a new bar with ocean views and rewire all 393 rooms.
Even so, he expects to lose about 10% of his business--at least in
the beginning--to the "curiosity factor" of visitors wanting to try
the newer hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "These new places have everything built right in, right from the
start," Dravinski said. "They have all the bells and whistles. So
what do we do? We improve ourselves inside and out."</TE>
<TE>   What seems like a sudden rush to build is actually the result of
several years of planning by developers, who began sizing up the
healthy Southern California hotel market in the mid- to late 1990s.
They saw that a large percentage of guests were Southern Californians
willing to treat themselves to weekend retreats at pricey hotel-spas.
By 2000, a strong economy was powering an even stronger travel
industry, and the cost of financing had dropped enough to encourage
developers to make their move.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything looked very good, very promising," said Alan X. Reay,
president of Atlas Hospitality Group in Costa Mesa, a consulting firm
that tracks hotel development in Southern California. "It was a
developers' dream."</TE>
<TE>   The resorts are not saying yet how they plan to try to stand out
from this thoroughbred pack, although all are boasting first-class
service. But the question remains: How can the elite class of
luxury-seeking tourists and business travelers keep all these
oceanfront resorts afloat?</TE>
<TE>   Many say the weak economy, a falloff in business travel that is
slow to rebound and the 25% drop in occupancy rates in the upscale
market since 9/11 will work against the high-end hotel market.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't possibly absorb that number of rooms in such a weak
market, in such a short amount of time," said Joel Hiser, president
of Horwath Hospitality Investment Advisors, a lodging real estate and
consulting firm in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any property opening up down there and doing
extremely well, not now, not for a long while," Hiser said. "I don't
care how long it's been since you had a five-star resort debut."</TE>
<TE>   Others say there has been such a shortage of luxury resorts in
Southern California, especially along the coast, that an increase in
supply of as much as 5% easily could be absorbed--but only in the
right economy. The number of rooms being developed amounts to about a
3% increase in supply, which experts say is realistic given the
growth of the region and upscale hotels' average 70% to 80% occupancy
rates.</TE>
<TE>   The new resort properties are counting on more than 60% of their
guests being Southern Californians, with visitors from New York, the
Midwest and overseas as their secondary markets.</TE>
<TE>   All also are counting on meetings and conventions to boost weekday
occupancies and building larger facilities for them than the area's
existing hotels can offer. The Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort
&amp; Spa--designed to simulate an Andalusian villa with four ocean-view
courtyards and Mediterranean-style gardens and fountains--will have
52,000 square feet for meetings and events, with the aim of becoming
the convention center of the coast.</TE>
<TE>   "The question isn't going to be demand, because the demand for
this type of hotel is there," Reay said. "The question is going to be
room rates. Can they generate the kind of rates they need? I don't
know. It's a high-risk proposition."</TE>
<TE>   To calculate the rates a new hotel needs to charge to start
earning a profit, the industry uses a general rule of 0.1% of the
building costs per room.</TE>
<TE>   For example, development costs for the 275-room Laguna Beach
Colony, which is scheduled to open in December, amount to roughly
$509,000 per room. Therefore the hotel would need to charge at least
$509 per room per night, Reay said. (The hotel says room rates will
start at $375 a night but it expects to be able to charge $500 within
two years.)</TE>
<TE>   But hotel room revenue in the United States is expected to fall
0.7% this year, according to a recent forecast by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which revised an earlier estimate that
revenue would rise 3% in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the impending competition is nerve-racking for
Bartell, who for years has found security in the luxury hotel market
by touting the 55-year-old Surf &amp; Sand as a
"wiggle-your-toes-in-the-sand" kind of place, a more laid-back
alternative to the Ritz-Carlton in adjacent Laguna Niguel but with
the same level of service. In Laguna Beach, Bartell said, the resort
always has enjoyed top-tier status.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get any closer to the ocean without getting wet," he
likes to say.</TE>
<TE>   And yet threatening to take away some of its business is The Lodge
at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, a quiet 175-room Craftsman-style resort
nestled among pines and a municipal golf course that opened last
month with rates for double rooms starting at $450 per night. The
Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach, with 519 rooms starting at $375 per
night, is scheduled to open later this year on Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Beach Colony, which perhaps poses the biggest threat to
older resorts because of its location (on the ocean in South Laguna),
size (30 acres) and amenities (20,000-square-foot spa and 12,000
square feet of meeting space), soon will follow. Billing itself as
Laguna's masterpiece by the sea, the cottage-style hotel will include
24 suites, 57 concierge-level guest rooms, four bungalows and
indoor-outdoor spa treatment rooms strung along a 55-foot bluff and
surrounded by public parkland.</TE>
<TE>   But for some veteran resort-goers, the new hotels may not be too
enticing. At the Ritz-Carlton, one couple said their third visit to
the Laguna Niguel property made them loyal customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Why mess with a sure thing?" said Evelyn Marks of Santa Barbara,
who was taking a three-day break at the Ritz with her husband, Ross,
while attending a wedding in Orange County. "We'll never go anywhere
else. If those other places take business away, it'll just mean more
room here for us."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Bishops Adopt Policy on Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Catholicism: Church leaders seek to remove all offenders,
but they draw fire for allowing them to technically stay in the
priesthood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Under intense pressure to stem a spiraling sex abuse crisis, the
nation's Roman Catholic bishops on Friday overwhelmingly approved
their first national policy to oust all priests from public ministry
who molest minors.</LD>
<LD>   In passing the policy by a vote of 239-13, the bishops closed a
controversial loophole that would have allowed perpetrators of a past
single offense to eventually return to a restricted ministry after
treatment.</LD>
<LD>   But in a new wrinkle that outraged victims' advocates, the bishops
left the door open for offenders to remain as priests with harsh
restrictions that would ban them from wearing clerical garb,
celebrating Mass and publicly presenting themselves as priests.</LD>
<TE>   The new policy contains no direct measure to penalize bishops who
continue to reassign, rather than remove, errant priests, a demand
that surfaced from victims and other dissident Catholics this week.
The bishops did pass a separate motion to direct a conference
committee to explore the issue of accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the imperfections, several bishops hailed the new policy
as an unprecedented document to protect children from sex abuse and
seek healing and reconciliation with victims and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the document morally obliges bishops in all
194 U.S. dioceses to report all allegations of sexual abuse of minors
to civil authorities, requires the expulsion of offenders from public
ministry and sets up a national lay review board. The board will
publicly name in annual reports those dioceses that fail to comply
with the policy--a sharp contrast from the tradition of clerical
secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came after six months of ceaseless headlines that have
chronicled a church pattern of protecting abusive priests. About 250
of the nation's 46,000 priests have resigned or been suspended during
that time. Four bishops have resigned, two priests have committed
suicide after being accused of abuse and another priest was shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Today the [bishops] took a profound step in a long and sorrowful
journey for the entire church," said Bishop Wilton D. Gregory,
president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "The charter
... ensures that young people are protected, that victims are truly
listened to and assisted, that all priests are trustworthy and that
all bishops act responsibly."</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy, director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused
by Priests, called the new policy terribly disappointing because it
did not eject all perpetrators from the priesthood or seek to remove
derelict bishops.</TE>
<TE>   But the newly appointed chairman of the national lay review board,
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, moved swiftly to invite victims'
advocates to serve as board members. At least one of them, Mark
Serrano of the survivors network group, has agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory and others said the uniform national policy was needed to
prevent dioceses from ignoring guidelines on sex abuse that the
bishops passed a decade ago. The lack of compliance led to tragic
cases of predatory priests who were kept in ministry only to violate
other victims, fueling widespread anger and an outcry for tough and
sweeping reforms.</TE>
<TE>   What was billed as one of the most important debates in the
history of the bishops conference began with a ringing declaration
from Archbishop Harry Flynn, chairman of the committee on sexual
abuse that drafted the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a defining moment for us ... to root out a cancer in our
church," Flynn told his fellow bishops.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line remains, and that is: No priest or deacon who has
abused a minor can remain in ministry. As good pastors attentive to
those we serve, we can do no less."</TE>
<TE>   However, the daylong debate revealed deep concerns and palpable
tensions among bishops, who were caught between public expectations
of reform and trepidation over subjecting priests to unjust actions.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, provisions to soften the policy were turned back one
after another as bishops repeatedly spoke out against what several of
them termed wiggle room.</TE>
<TE>   In one exchange, some asked for amendments to require them to
report to civil authorities only credible allegations, saying they
did not want to stain the reputation of priests with false
accusations. Others worried that the provision would break the bond
of trust between priests and bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, among others, countered
that the public had criticized bishops for trying to handle the
problem within the church--and in the process had delayed justice.
(Mahony has been criticized for transferring a priest to several
parishes in the Los Angeles Archdiocese after the priest told him in
the mid-1980s that he had molested young boys.)</TE>
<TE>   Noting that he had been falsely accused twice of molestation,
Mahony said immediate intervention by law enforcement had cleared him
swiftly and publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "I welcome police intervention.... It helps us greatly," Mahony
said. The new national policy will not greatly affect Los Angeles,
because the archdiocese already requires the dismissal of any priest
found to have sexually abused minors.</TE>
<TE>   After five hours of debate and earlier consideration of 107 pages
of proposed amendments, the bishops adopted the policy.</TE>
<TE>   The policy will be forwarded to the Vatican, which must approve it
to make it legally binding on all bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas Reese, editor of the national Catholic magazine
America, said the bishops' approval of a document containing
provisions that some Vatican officials had publicly criticized, such
as reporting all sex abuse allegations to civil authorities, marked a
sea change in the American leaders' relationship with Rome.</TE>
<TE>   In the two decades he has attended bishops' conferences, Reese
said, American bishops had usually treated any Vatican concern with
great deference. But the only public reference any bishop made to
Rome during their two-day meeting was a comment by Pope John Paul II:
"There is no place in the priesthood or religious life for those who
would harm the young."</TE>
<TE>   "The pope indicated that he trusted the U.S. bishops and told them
to go home and fix this problem," Reese said. "The bishops basically
said: If the Vatican doesn't agree with us, we'll go straight to the
man in white."</TE>
<TE>   Reese said, however, that worries over Vatican reaction may have
had led bishops to back off on an earlier draft provision that
required them to seek to defrock any offender. He said some Vatican
officials had expressed concern about an overly sweeping policy that
could jeopardize the due process rights of priests. Numerous bishops
disagreed with Reese's speculation.</TE>
<TE>   In supporting the new clause that would keep some offenders in the
priesthood, Bishop David Foley argued that defrocking all offenders
and throwing them into the community was irresponsible. Mahony said
he expected that the only offenders who would not be forcibly
defrocked were the very elderly or infirm, and Auxiliary Bishop
Timothy Dolan of Pittsburgh said compassion for such men prompted him
to support their retention in the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   And Keating said he would, as review committee chairman, recommend
to the Vatican the removal of any bishop who covered up abuse.
Keating, a former FBI agent and local prosecutor, also said any
cover-up could constitute obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Still, victims of abuse, who moved bishops Thursday with tearful
testimony about their experiences, expressed shock and anger that
perpetrators could still technically remain priests.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still in a place of honor and they still have access to
families," said Peter Isely of the Survivors Network of Those Abused
by Priests. "Catholics need to voice their displeasure, because their
money will be used to house and feed sex offenders."</TE>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>To hear the bishops talk, sexually abusive priests can expect knocks
on their door as soon as their bishops get home Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a profound step in a long and sorrowful journey," Bishop
Wilton D. Gregory, president of the Roman Catholic bishops
conference, said after Friday's 239-13 vote on the first national
policy to discipline priests who abuse minors.</LD>
<LD>   But Gregory was quick to add a caveat. "Our action today is not a
panacea. The charter is not perfect."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, while the bishops stood up and applauded themselves for an
undeniably historic vote, they know better than anyone that the real
work lies ahead. They laid down the rules of the game, but winning it
will be no slam-dunk.</TE>
<TE>   There are committees to put in place to carry out the plan on a
national level. Local bishops who haven't done so already will have
to update their sexual abuse prevention policies so they conform to
the standards approved here Friday. And, the Vatican must still
approve changes in church law to throw the weight of canon law behind
the U.S. bishops' good intentions.</TE>
<TE>   The plain fact is, despite the bishops' insistence that the plan
is "mandatory," a rogue bishop could ignore the whole thing if he
wanted. That, however, is unlikely for several reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, by voting for the compact, bishops are honor bound to make
good on their pledges to one another.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, new national bodies to be created by the bishops,
including an Office for Child and Youth Protection, will help local
bishops strengthen their sexual abuse prevention policies--and
closely monitor their progress. It will issue an annual public
report.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops' compliance also will depend on the continued
vigilance of the news media and of victim abuse support groups that
for decades have dogged the church hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   There was added incentive for compliance announced Friday: the
appointment of Gov. Frank Keating, a no-nonsense former FBI agent, as
chairman of the new national Office for Child and Youth Protection.</TE>
<TE>   Keating wasted no time in telling reporters that he will not only
see to it that bishops are in hot pursuit of molesting priests, but
that bishops themselves may become his target.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged that if he finds any bishop--past, present or
future--who has covered up a priest's crime of sexually abusing a
minor, he will report the matter to Pope John Paul II.</TE>
<TE>   The plan approved Friday is the toughest ever adopted by U.S.
bishops. But local bishops will retain a certain amount of discretion
in carrying it out. For example, while it calls upon bishops to
always forward reports of abuse to civil authorities, it leaves it up
to the bishop how to follow through.</TE>
<TE>   If bishops follow their plan, there will be no choice but to
permanently remove any priest found to have sexually abused a child
at any time--past, present or future. Priests will be forbidden to
wear their Roman collars and other priestly garb. They will be barred
from publicly celebrating Mass, the central act of Catholic worship.
They would not be able to even pose as a priest even though,
theologically, they remain a priest forever.</TE>
<TE>   The compact also gives bishops discretion on whether to go beyond
the removal of a priest from public ministry to seeking the ultimate
penalty--ouster from the priesthood. This was a compromise: An early
draft of the compact would have made it mandatory to seek a priest's
removal in all cases.</TE>
<TE>   As the plan unfolds, it will be closely watched in the next two
years as the church works out the bugs, refines legal definitions
and, hopefully, wins Vatican approval to cast what is essentially
voluntary compliance into the hard rock of legal stone.</TE>
<TE>   But, the bishops think they have already accomplished much since
the sexual abuse scandal--which has persisted for decades--flared
anew this year with reports that priests had been transferred from
parish to parish as they continued their molestation of minors.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, perhaps the prayers raised by the bishops Friday
morning before the debate and vote may have been answered, at least
in part.</TE>
<TE>   In those early morning moments, the litany of dark headlines of
priestly sexual abuse and cover-ups by bishops fell before an ancient
litany of confession.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops prayed for a humble and contrite heart. They asked to
be washed of their guilt and cleansed from their sin.</TE>
<TE>   "My sin is always before me," they said in unison, a hoary prayer
as current as the morning headlines. "What is evil in your sight I
have done.... Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, their actions were to speak louder than their words.
Their petitions to heaven were borne not on prayers alone, but by
votes.</TE>

<HD>Leaders Humbled by Accusations, Debate</HD>
<DH>Conference: Prelates hear victims' tearful accounts and the
angry reproach of critics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The result of the U.S. bishops' conference this week wasn't just a
tougher policy on the sexual abuse of minors.</LD>
<LD>   It also produced a humbled group of church leaders.</LD>
<LD>   These are men who operate their dioceses independently and answer
only to the Vatican. The cardinals among them are used to being
referred to as "your eminence."</LD>
<TE>   But for two days, the 300 bishops fielded pointed questions from
reporters, who outnumbered them nearly 2 to 1, heard tear-producing
stories from victims of priestly sexual abuse and absorbed tongue
lashings from church supporters whom they invited to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "What are [people] saying about you, the successors to the
apostles?" said one of the critics, Scott Appleby, a professor at the
University of Notre Dame. "I don't think the suspense will be broken
if we admit that at this particular moment in American history, they
are not comparing you to Christ and his apostles."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews Friday, many bishops said the unrelenting criticism
was exactly what their group needed to hear after a half-year of
mounting public outrage filtered through news media.</TE>
<TE>   "I approached the conference with a certain amount of dread," said
Jaime Soto, the auxiliary bishop of Orange, which covers Orange
County. "Now I feel a certain amount of relief at having been able to
engage the victims and the issue together with my fellow bishops. It
was anguishing and uplifting."</TE>
<TE>   Soto's change of emotions was mirrored by other bishops, who said
the conference's opening day of victim testimony quelled any serious
opposition to enacting a "zero-tolerance" policy for abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop David E. Foley, from Birmingham, Ala., was moved by the way
his colleagues became silent as the abuse victims told their stories.</TE>
<TE>   "And where there is silence," Foley said, "there is God. God
speaks in silence."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Edward J. O'Donnell of Lafayette, La., was moved the same
way. "You have to be terribly stupid not to feel it."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell, a longtime backer of zero tolerance, said the victims'
speeches also swayed bishops who thought some accusers had come
forward for monetary gain or to hurt the church. The prelates
"realized that we've got a serious problem of our own making. And we
had an opportunity to do something about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Soto said, the events of the conference "made him
soberly aware of my own humanity and the need for God's grace."</TE>
<TE>   The conference produced a different type of humbling experience
for Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston. Once the most powerful Catholic
leader in the nation, and still the longest-serving American
cardinal, Law has been at the epicenter of the church's crisis since
it was revealed in January that he moved a priest from parish to
parish despite accusations that the priest had molested 130 boys.</TE>
<TE>   During the bishops' meeting, in which many bishops scheduled news
briefings for reporters, the gray-haired cardinal remained
sequestered on the second floor of the Fairmont Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Law refused all media requests and traveled through the hotel
lobby with a burly clergyman at his side. Law apologized in closed
session to his fellow bishops for his role in the scandal, but
offered only a few insignificant suggestions during the public
debate. Bishop Wilton Gregory, president of the conference, even
gently rebuffed Law in the cardinal's final attempt to speak during
the proceedings on sexual abuse policy. In the interest of time, Law
was told, his testimony would not be heard.</TE>
<TE>   Law's lot probably won't get much better at the next conference of
bishops in November. During that session, a subcommittee of bishops
will present ways to hold prelates accountable if they harbor
molesting priests.</TE>
<TE>   The conference produced plenty of evidence that Los Angeles
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, while tainted by the abuse scandal at home,
remains an influential prelate.</TE>
<TE>   During a single lunch break Friday, for instance, Mahony squeezed
in television interviews with CNN, Fox News, CBS and MSNBC. Later, he
also helped reporters on deadline by holding a series of news
conferences in the hotel's makeshift television studios and in his
hotel suite immediately after the conference's final vote--a
media-friendly gesture unusual for a cardinal or most bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The most damaging allegation against Mahony, as reported by The
Times in May, is that he transferred Father Michael Stephen Baker to
several parishes after the priest told him in 1986 that he had
molested young boys. The cardinal later approved a secret
$1.3-million settlement with two men allegedly abused by Baker in the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese last month hired Sitrick and Co., a high-profile
public relations firm, to boost its public image. In addition to two
public relations specialists from the archdiocese, Mahony brought two
Sitrick executives to Dallas. A diocesan spokesman said the Sitrick
executives offered no public relations advice to Mahony during the
two-day conference.</TE>
<TE>   In the conference proceedings, Mahony also found himself in the
spotlight, forcefully advocating zero tolerance, sharing his
experiences of being falsely accused of molestation, and even giving
advice on how to speed up the bishops' lagging debate--which brought
applause.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony also pulled off perhaps his biggest feat: getting a laugh
out of the weary bishops. When one of his amendments had been
misplaced, Mahony, looking bewildered for a moment, said he had given
it earlier to someone in the hotel hallway who wore a "staff" member
badge.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said: "I hope it wasn't room service."</TE>

<LD>Gov. Jim Hodges ordered state troopers and other authorities to South
Carolina's borders to stop federal shipments of plutonium that could
begin arriving from Colorado as early as this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Hodges, who has vehemently opposed the shipments, read a statement
in Columbia declaring a state of emergency but refused to answer any
questions about specific plans for roadblocks or other barricades at
the Savannah River Site, a nuclear weapon complex near Aiken.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge on Thursday refused to block the shipments of
weapon-grade plutonium. Hodges appealed and asked for a delay until
the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals could hear the case.</LD>
<TE>   The Energy Department plans to move the material from the Rocky
Flats weapon installation in Colorado, which is being closed. At the
Savannah River site, the material would be converted into nuclear

<HD>At Ohio State, Bush Seeks Volunteers</HD>
<DH>Youth: President urges graduates to pursue a lifetime of
service to others. It's 'a matter of conscience,' he says in
commencement address.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Friday urged young Americans to dedicate themselves
to a lifetime of serving others, telling about 6,000 Ohio State
University graduates that volunteerism is "a matter of conscience."</LD>
<LD>   In a commencement address, his second this spring, the president
recalled the selfless acts of the Sept. 11 heroes and told his
audience: "You will determine whether our new ethic of responsibility
is the break of a wave or the rise of a tide. You will determine
whether we become a culture of selfishness and look inward or whether
we will embrace a culture of service and look outward."</LD>
<LD>   In his commencement address at West Point two weeks ago, Bush
enunciated a policy of preemptive military strikes against
terrorists. In his speech Friday, he mentioned the war on terrorism
largely in the context of public service.</LD>
<TE>   Those killed on Sept. 11 trying to save the lives of others "led
the first counterattack in the war on terror," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In these events we relearned something large and important: The
achievements that last and count in life come through sacrifice and
compassion and service."</TE>
<TE>   One reason Bush chose to speak at Ohio State is that the school
has an unusually high rate of volunteerism, with nearly 70% of
graduating seniors having performed public service.</TE>
<TE>   "Your idealism is needed in America," the president said, adding
that too many citizens still are relegated to "the shadow of our
nation's prosperity."</TE>
<TE>   "America needs more than taxpayers, spectators and occasional
voters. America needs full-time citizens. America needs men and women
who respond to the call of duty, who stand up for the weak, who speak
up for their beliefs, who sacrifice for a greater good."</TE>
<TE>   Bush launched a major federal volunteer program, USA Freedom
Corps, in January, urging each American to spend at least 4,000 hours
over a lifetime performing community service.</TE>
<TE>   Since then he has frequently touted volunteerism in speeches
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   To further encourage volunteerism, he announced a new partnership
between the Freedom Corps and an array of the nation's largest
service organizations. This will create "the most comprehensive
clearinghouse of volunteer opportunities ever assembled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, Bush received an honorary doctorate of public
administration. Others honored included New York Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted an aside from the president during his remarks: "I
guess we're both being honored as legends of baseball--legends, at
least, in our own minds." Bush is a onetime managing partner and an
owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, the president traveled to Houston, where he
toured a summer enrichment camp run by the Assn. for the Advancement
of Mexican Americans. He spoke again about volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Friday was Flag Day, Bush said: "We can talk about
patriotism, but a true patriot is one not only who salutes the flag,
but a true patriot is one who serves the community in which they
live."</TE>
<TE>   Also in Houston, he headlined an evening fund-raiser for Gov. Rick
Perry and the state Republican Party that was expected to raise about
$2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is spending the weekend at his Texas ranch, near Crawford.</TE>

<HD>Turf Battles Could Snag Bush's Security Proposal</HD>
<DH>Congress: The push for a new Cabinet department is turning
into a power struggle as lawmakers seek to protect their special
interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It was a crisis-ridden day at the White House. An alleged "dirty"
bomb terrorist plot had been revealed. Israel's prime minister was in
town for talks on the volatile Middle East. The India-Pakistan
dispute remained tense. And where was President Bush's right-hand
man?</LD>
<LD>   Andrew H. Card Jr., Bush's chief of staff, was on Capitol Hill,
urging committee functionaries to put aside petty turf wars and
support the president's plan to create a new Department of Homeland
Security. Card's focus on massaging House and Senate aides was a
measure of how large congressional power struggles loom as an
obstacle to quick approval of Bush's plan.</LD>
<LD>   House and Senate leaders ended their initial work on the plan this
week by setting an ambitious timetable for acting on legislation to
carry out the reorganization. But they face widespread skepticism
that they can meet the Sept. 11 deadline some have set. And even to
get the job done by the end of the year, the leaders face the
prospect of hand-to-hand combat with other congressional power
brokers.</LD>
<TE>   "The biggest obstacle is parochialism," said House Majority Leader
Dick Armey (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many lawmakers wondering what the new department would
mean for the nation's security also are asking a second question:
What does it mean for me?</TE>
<TE>   At stake is not just the shape of the federal bureaucracy but the
power structure in Congress. That's because the reorganization would
affect the committees that give lawmakers their institutional
identity, the home-state interests they were elected to protect and
the issues they have built their careers around.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, leaders of the House Transportation Committee balked at the
new department subsuming two of the biggest agencies the panel
oversees. Californians wrung their hands about the apparent effort to
make Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, located east of San Francisco,
part of the new agency. New Mexicans jockeyed to keep their state's
federally financed labs out of the plan. Farm-state lawmakers
similarly questioned plans to move into the new agency animal and
plant inspection programs now administered by the Agriculture
Department.</TE>
<TE>   It took congressional leaders all week just to figure out how to
handle the bill that would set up the new agency, juggling the
competing claims of committee barons who wanted a hand in drafting
it.</TE>
<TE>   Such turf wars arise from an understandable instinct to hold onto
the clout and expertise lawmakers spend their careers acquiring. But
Bush wasted no time turning the spotlight on that dynamic. Since
proposing the new department in a nationwide speech June 6, he and
his aides continually have warned that self-serving congressional
power struggles threaten to derail it.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, Bush has laid the groundwork for blaming Congress if
the government fails to deter a future terrorist attack. That, in
turn, should give lawmakers a powerful political incentive to
suppress their natural instincts to guard their turf.</TE>
<TE>   "The terror of being on the wrong side of a terrorist attack will
motivate Congress," said Norman Ornstein, an expert on Congress at
the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Bush paid homage to the barons of the status quo
when he invited key congressional committee leaders to the White
House on Wednesday to discuss his proposal. When one senator asked
him how he thought Congress should organize its handling of the bill
to create the new department, Bush demurred. "I'm not going to touch
that," Bush said, according to one source at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Committee chairmen jockeyed for position throughout the week, as
congressional leaders decided whether to create a new committee to
handle the bill or allow it to be debated by the dozens of committees
and subcommittees with jurisdiction over the various functions that
would be merged.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leaders decided to stick with the current system. House
leaders chose a middle course that allows existing committees to make
recommendations to a special committee appointed by the leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the venue, drafting the measure will require lawmakers to
resolve not just big questions--such as whether to keep the CIA and
FBI separate from the new department, as Bush advocates--but also a
welter of more parochial concerns.</TE>
<TE>   For example, loud complaints have come from the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which oversees some of
the biggest agencies that would be transferred to the new department.
These include the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the Transportation Security Administration, which is
overseeing the new airport security work force.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the transportation panel,
opposes putting the Coast Guard into the new department because he
fears the guard's non-security functions will be given short shrift
in a department whose primary mission is homeland security. The Coast
Guard's non-defense functions--including oil-spill response,
icebreaking and enforcement of laws against fish poaching--are
especially important to his home state.</TE>
<TE>   Young said he worries that if the Coast Guard is supervised by
officials "whose primary focus is security, you can forget about
search and rescue, you can forget about fishing patrols."</TE>
<TE>   He also is concerned about transferring the Transportation Safety
Administration just a few months after it was created in post-Sept.
11 legislation crafted largely by his committee.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), a committee member, joined Young
in airing such complaints at the Wednesday meeting with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Oberstar also raised questions about the wisdom of moving FEMA
into the new department when so much of FEMA's work is disaster aid
unrelated to homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers say they plan to resist raising home-state concerns
as part of a debate on national security. "I don't think parochialism
is going to stand against Bush's leadership," said Sen. Jeff Sessions
(R-Ala.). He said he would not fight to keep Alabama's center for
domestic preparedness from being transferred to the new department.</TE>
<TE>   But other members have not been so shy. Sen. Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.) proposed that a special office be established within the new
department to address New York's special needs.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) is among
lawmakers from farm-belt states concerned about putting the
Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
into the new agency. The service plays a role in biological warfare
defense, but it also enforces animal welfare laws and conducts
research that has nothing to do with homeland security. Harkin is
worried about the effect on an animal disease laboratory in his home
state that is partially run by the service.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Alamo) has been a leading supporter of a
homeland security department. But she swung into action when she
learned that the Bush proposal seemed to call for including in it the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which is in her district. She asked
Rep. William M. "Mac" Thornberry (R-Texas) to convey her concerns to
the White House. By Wednesday, she won assurances from Tom Ridge,
Bush's homeland security director, that the lab would not be
subsumed.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) wrote to Bush urging him to leave his
home state's two national labs in the Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   The array of such concerns is what makes many lawmakers dubious
that Congress can reach the goal of finishing the bill by Sept. 11.
"That is just not a reachable goal," said Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.).
"It's too much heavy lifting."</TE>

<HD>For Ex-President Clinton, Talk Isn't Cheap</HD>
<DH>Finances: The 42nd chief executive earned more than $9
million last year on lecture circuit, disclosure forms filed by Sen.
Clinton show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and CHUCK NEUBAUER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton made more than $9.2 million delivering
speeches last year while his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
(D-N.Y.), received $2.85 million as an advance on her book, according
to congressional financial disclosure reports released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Clintons still owe more than $1.75 million in legal fees--even
after paying $1.3 million last year--for their defense in White House
investigations, the reports show.</LD>
<LD>   The first detailed look at the ex-president's financial
opportunities show that he delivered about 60 speeches last year,
traveling from Omaha to Trinidad and beyond. He fetched as much as
$350,000 for a speech.</LD>
<TE>   The fees are "almost certainly a record for a former president,"
said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for
Politics.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton is extending to his own bank account the same skills that
made him, during his presidency, one of the most prolific political
fund-raisers ever. Naturally, as with most things Clintonian,
controversy follows.</TE>
<TE>   "He is cashing in at a level one would expect of former President
Clinton," said Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional
Accountability Project, a government watchdog.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Payne, a spokeswoman for the former president, said: "He is
the most requested speaker on the lecture circuit in the world." She
said that the ex-president could be booked every day for the next
three or four years if he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The former president received $450,000 over three days from MIKI
Corp., a Japanese company that manufactures vitamins and a
nutritional supplement, and $400,000 for three speeches in three days
in Scotland and England from the Jewish National Fund.</TE>
<TE>   In nearly all cases, Clinton charged at least $125,000 per speech,
with 12 at the price of $200,000 or above. The London School of
Economics got the former president for a bargain: $28,100. Among
others paying to hear Clinton were Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.,
Oracle Corp. and Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Many of his speeches focus on globalization and "interdependence"
of nations on one another, Payne said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not the First to Cash In</TE>
<TE>   Clinton is not the first ex-president to be well-paid on the
lecture circuit. Former President Reagan received about $2 million
for two 20-minute speeches in Japan in 1989. And former President
Bush has collected around $4 million annually for making speeches.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Clinton said some of the ex-president's paid
appearances were in conjunction with fund-raisers for charitable
causes.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the Clintons paid in excess of $1.3 million for legal
fees they and some former staff members incurred during
investigations in the 1990s. That is separate from payments made by
their Legal Expense Trust, which has paid $7.2 million, including
$350,000 in 2001, according to a Clinton aide.</TE>
<TE>   The former president's speaking prowess is hardly a surprise. As a
candidate, Clinton was famous for his tireless political fund-raising
skills, often attending back-to-back banquets and attending at least
237 money-raising events during the 10 months leading to the 1996
election to raise more than $119 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just amazing," Sabato added. "I've told students for years:
The presidents should pay us. It's a ticket to multimillionaire
status."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Clinton reported receiving a portion of her $8-million
advance from Simon &amp; Schuster for a book due out in 2003 on her years
as first lady. A Clinton aide said the senator over the years has
donated about $1 million to charity from sales of her book "It Takes
a Village."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Clinton also reported that she and her husband had assets of
at least $1 million in a blind trust. She reported no income from the
trust for last year because of losses in the stock markets, an aide
said.</TE>
<TE>   The filings show that more than one-third of California's
delegation is made up of millionaires. Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein and her husband have so many investments that her form runs
124 pages. She and her husband, San Francisco financier Richard Blum,
listed assets worth at least $34 million.</TE>
<TE>   The forms also show that the Senate remains a millionaires' club.
And they show that in some cases, lawmakers suffered the same
financial blows as ordinary investors in 2001, losing money on stock
in Enron Corp. and Global Crossing, for example.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to determine a lawmaker's precise net worth from
the forms since personal assets and liabilities are reported in only
broad ranges, from $250,001 to $500,000, for instance. But the forms
offer a glimpse into how lawmakers responsible for managing the
taxpayers' money manage their own.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are not required to list their salary, which is $150,000
this year. Nor do they have to specify the amount of their spouse's
salary. They do not have to include the value of personal residences
unless they receive rental income from them.</TE>
<TE>   Among the outside income reported by lawmakers was $3,500 in
"winnings" that Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said he earned from a
tennis tournament. Income from activities other than salary and
investments was limited to $21,765 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A number of lawmakers received honoraria, such as fees for
appearing on the TV show "Politically Incorrect," but that money must
be donated to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Among potential presidential contenders, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.) reported that his wife, Hadassah, received $328,000 for
speeches, mostly at $16,000 per speech and mostly to Jewish groups.
Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) reported that his wife, Teresa Heinz, of
the ketchup fortune, held stocks and bonds worth at least $88
million. Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) reported stocks and bonds in a
blind trust worth $5 million to $25 million, plus other assets.</TE>
<TE>   The reports show that some lawmakers made unlucky investments.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caught Up in Enron</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Susan Davis (D-San Diego) and her husband owned 200 shares of
Enron stock worth about $16,000 in January 2001. At the end of the
year, after Enron declared bankruptcy, their stock was worth $52, an
aide said. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) reported that his wife, Wendy, a
former Enron board member, is owed more than $500,000 in deferred
compensation, but the form suggests she believes she has little
chance of getting it.</TE>
<TE>   Some politicians also considered energy stocks a risky investment
politically.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who has accused energy companies of
gouging consumers during the 2000-01 California energy crisis, dumped
her stock in El Paso Energy Corp. and Mirant Corp., while placing her
and her husband's million-dollar-plus investments in a blind trust.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders, in contrast to some of their colleagues,
were of relatively modest means. The eight-page report filed by
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) listed assets ranging
from $451,000 to about $1.3 million. Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) listed assets ranging from $126,000 to $540,000, with
$60,000 to $115,000 in liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Among House leaders, Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) received
more than 200 contributions totaling about $428,000 for his legal
defense against a lawsuit filed by the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. The suit was dropped. House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.) listed assets ranging from roughly $405,000 to about
$1 million, with liabilities ranging from $215,000 to $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), who is retiring, listed a
$20,000 teaching fee from Southern Methodist University. Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) listed assets of from roughly
$134,000 to $610,000, with liabilities of $65,000 to $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to California's two senators, at least 16 of the
state's 52 representatives are millionaires. At the other end of the
spectrum, Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) reported that he sold his
Washington, D.C., condominium and listed no other income or assets.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House tried to shrug off questions Friday about a computer
disk found on a Washington street by a Senate Democratic aide that
outlines Republican political strategies and vulnerabilities for the
2002 elections.</LD>
<LD>   The disk contains presentations by White House Political Director
Ken Mehlman and senior political advisor Karl Rove urging Republican
candidates to stress the war on terrorism and the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Mehlman said Democrats had a "strong chance" to pick up Senate
seats in New Hampshire and Arkansas, but he listed five Democratic
seats with a "strong chance" to go Republican: South Dakota,
Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and Georgia. Republican Sens. Bob Smith of
New Hampshire and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas have long been
considered vulnerable.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats reacted with glee over the discovery of the disk,
apparently lost after a presentation by the two aides at a hotel near
the White House and circulated soon afterward. Democrats questioned
if the political strategies were put together on public property.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't that what the Republican National Committee is for?" one
Democratic strategist asked, recalling constant Republican criticism
and questions about the political activities of the Clinton team.</TE>
<TE>   "I am shocked, shocked that the director of the White House office
of political affairs would be concerned in any way with political
affairs," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks Dietary Herb Study Amid Product Safety Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two years after federal health officials wanted warning labels on
ephedra, the Bush administration instead is ordering a
start-from-scratch safety review of the herb, which has been linked
to dozens of deaths.</LD>
<LD>   The move prompted outrage from consumer advocates and doctors who
want ephedra banned, citing the dietary supplement's link to heart
attacks and strokes.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a black day in medicine," said Dr. Raymond Woosley, vice
president of health sciences at the University of Arizona, who called
the risk clear enough that further study would be unethical.</LD>
<TE>   But supplement makers, including leading ephedra marketer
Metabolife International, praised the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Clinical trials that have been done over the years ... show the
products are safe," said Wes Seigner, attorney for the Ephedra
Education Council.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, the Food and Drug Administration ordered six
companies to stop illegally selling synthetic ephedrine in the guise
of an herb.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA for years has sought to stop such sales, which occur
mostly via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   More controversial is the legal use of ephedra--the actual herb,
not chemical cousins--for weight loss and bodybuilding.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine two years ago
said at least 54 deaths and about 1,000 reports of complications have
been linked to the popular supplement since the mid-1990s. One theory
is that the herb, especially when combined with caffeine or exercise,
overstimulates the heart.</TE>

<HD>In Colo., New Fire Worry Is Damage to Tourism Industry</HD>
<DH>Business: Daily media images of a state ablaze are taking
hold in the country. Officials fear millions of potential visitors
may stay away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>While an army of firefighters struggles to shield residences from
Colorado's massive wildfires, a fight has begun to protect another
potential casualty: the state's $7-billion tourism industry.</LD>
<LD>   A week of apocalyptic images has sunk in across the
nation--towering flames leaping from tree to tree, frightened
homeowners fleeing in packed cars. It appears, on television at
least, that "all of Colorado is burning," as the governor put it this
week.</LD>
<LD>   Businesses in Denver take exception to that, especially as peak
tourism season begins. Nearly three-fourths of the city's 10 million
visitors come during June, July and August, and city officials want
the world to know that Denver is open for business.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't have people thinking, as has been reported on some
national broadcasts, that the fire is at Denver's door," Mayor
Wellington Webb said this week. "The city is operating as it would on
any other day. Denver is not on fire."</TE>
<TE>   Try to explain that to concerned friends and relatives around the
nation, who have puzzled over maps on TV and in newspapers that seem
to suggest Denver is engulfed in flames. Many here are fielding
frantic calls.</TE>
<TE>   For Donna Kato, an electrician, the call came from her mother.
"She said, 'I just called to see if you were burning up.' I said, 'Ah
... not yet.' Everyone seems to think we're on fire."</TE>
<TE>   This at a time when Colorado is experiencing its worst drought on
record, turning green mountains to dun brown. The drought and extreme
fire danger have also caused the closure of some state forests and
parks, with more anticipated. By July 1, the city is expected to
impose mandatory water rationing, thus condemning Denver's lovely
lawns and parks to a sure death.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, fire officials estimate it could take all
summer to fully extinguish the fire, which sprawls across four of the
state's most populous counties.</TE>
<TE>   The state is so concerned that its tourism office is developing a
national advertising campaign to lure tourists to the state,
reminding Americans that "only 1% of Colorado is on fire." Indeed,
about 150,000 acres are on fire throughout the state. On the site of
the state's largest blaze--the ferocious 102,000-acre Hayman fire
that has become the star of nightly newscasts--cooler weather Friday
helped the firefighting effort again. Crews labored to dig a 90-mile
firebreak around the blaze, which was 30% contained Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 1,800 firefighters and support crews fought the Hayman
fire, which stretches for 20 miles and still threatens 10,000 homes
in suburbs 30 miles south of Denver. For a second day, military cargo
planes from Peterson Air Force Base near Colorado Springs were used
to drop fire retardant.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good day for firefighting," said Larry Young of the
Forest Service. "We went on the offensive. This is the most people
we've had fighting the fire at any time."</TE>
<TE>   More than 6,000 people remain evacuated. Fire officials estimate
that 22 homes have been destroyed, but say that figure will rise as
survey crews tour the burned areas.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of the burn area is evidently unclear to those who
don't live here. Eugene Dilbeck, president of the Denver Metro
Convention and Visitors Bureau, was at a tourism trade show this week
and said Denver's booth was swamped with convention planners who
wondered if downtown hotels were still standing.</TE>
<TE>   "They actually thought the fire was in town, that's the way the
media has been playing the thing," Dilbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   "The city and all of the activities that have been planned this
summer, even the professional [Fourth of July] fireworks display, are
still on.... There's really no reason not to come to Denver."</TE>
<TE>   The city takes in $2.3 billion from tourism, which, as is true for
the rest of the state, is dependent on natural beauty: majestic
mountains, green forests and blue skies. And the fire's smoky haze
over the metro area every day is not a pretty picture.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Bill Owens, who also described Denver's smoke-filled skies as
"dark as a nuclear winter," has made such dire pronouncements in part
to secure federal disaster aid. It worked. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency wrote Colorado a $20-million check on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After state tourism interests voiced concern this week, Owens
toned down his descriptions of the situation. But he defended his
earlier statements, saying he had an obligation to fully inform
Coloradans of the extent of the "disaster."</TE>

<DL>WICHITA, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of mourners, including former Sen. Bob Dole, packed a church
Friday for the funeral of Martin Burnham, the kidnapped missionary
killed in the Philippines during a bloody rescue that freed his wife.</LD>
<LD>   A large floral arrangement covered the coffin, somber piano music
played and slides chronicling the missionary couple's lives were
shown at Central Christian Church.</LD>
<LD>   Burnham's wife, Gracia, 43, still in a wheelchair after being shot
in the leg during the rescue from Muslim extremists, bowed as Pastor
Joe Wright led the mourners in prayer.</LD>
<TE>   Letters from relatives were read by Burnham's uncle, the Rev.
Galen Hinshaw.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was the most generous person I have ever known," the
Burnhams' 12-year-old daughter, Mindy, wrote in one of the letters.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Clay Bowlin, a Kansas City pastor whom Burnham had
requested give his funeral sermon should he die as a hostage,
recounted their time as Bible college students and Burnham's career
as a missionary pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord, 23 years ago, when my brother and I were in college
together, you were with us then, and you're with us now," he said.
"His great gift was for encouragement. He put others in front of
himself."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Oli Jacobsen of New Tribes Mission recalled Burnham as
"kind and gentle, but he was no weak person."</TE>
<TE>   "He always took time to hike to missionaries' homes, even though
it was often quite a distance, to spend some time with them,"
Jacobsen said.</TE>
<TE>   The service was expected to draw more than 4,000 people. In
addition to Dole, other dignitaries included Republican Sen. Sam
Brownback of Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham and Filipino nurse Ediborah Yap were killed last week
during a firefight between the Philippine army and Abu Sayyaf rebels,
who had been holding them and Gracia Burnham since May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Gracia Burnham returned to her home in Rose Hill, Kan., on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Lawyers Allege Threats, Abuse</HD>
<DH>Court: Defense papers say U.S. soldiers talked of killing
the American Talib. Trial is in August.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for John Walker Lindh charged Friday that U.S. military
personnel threatened to shoot or hang him after his capture last fall
and that he waived his right to legal counsel because he was told
there were no lawyers in Afghanistan who could help him.</LD>
<LD>   The defense team also sought to explain why Lindh did not
cooperate with CIA agent Johnny "Mike" Spann and warn him that his
life was in danger shortly before Spann was killed during a prison
revolt. Lindh, his lawyers said, assumed Spann and another CIA agent
were working for the Northern Alliance and that Taliban soldiers like
himself would be tortured.</LD>
<LD>   "At no time," the defense lawyers said, "did the two Americans
identify themselves or indicate that they were not a part of [the
Northern Alliance] forces."</LD>
<TE>   Defense lawyers made their assertions in nearly 250 pages of
documents filed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., where they
are asking a federal judge to rule that none of the statements their
client made to authorities should be allowed at his August trial.</TE>
<TE>   The defense argued that Lindh, 21, of Northern California, was
illegally shielded from his San Francisco lawyer and that, through
harassment and deprivation, he was coerced into signing away his
right to legal assistance. Otherwise, they said, he never would have
talked.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers, however, have maintained that Lindh knew
exactly what he was doing when he agreed to speak to military and FBI
interrogators on a handful of occasions. Those statements form the
basis for the indictment against Lindh, charging that he turned his
back on his native country and assisted Osama bin Laden in his
terrorist campaign against the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have denied that Lindh was tortured and have said
conditions were harsh because it was a war zone.</TE>
<TE>   Judge T.S. Ellis III is expected to rule next month on whether
Lindh's statements will be allowed at trial. Defense lawyers are
scheduled to file more motions Monday about why any incriminating
statements should be stricken from the case and Lindh's alleged
confession kept from the jury.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's decision is likely to be pivotal to the trial's
outcome, so the fight over the statements looms as the most crucial
legal battlefront in the fate of the so-called American Talib.</TE>
<TE>   A week before the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, Lindh joined the Taliban's front-line forces in
Afghanistan, sent there to fight the Northern Alliance. The Northern
Alliance, which was trying to wrest control of the country from the
Taliban, was known for brutality, including "mutilation, castration
and rape to terrorize local civilians and torture captured soldiers,"
Lindh lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   During the fighting, nearly a third of Lindh's unit was killed,
and he was captured and taken to a prison fort. By that time, his
lawyers said, he was weak and dehydrated. At one point, "unable to
find a space in which to lie down, Mr. Lindh spent the night without
sleep, crouched near a corner that was used as a toilet by the
basement inhabitants," they said.</TE>
<TE>   The first interrogation was attempted by Spann and the other CIA
agent. At that time, the lawyers said, Northern Alliance troops were
pulling Taliban captives out of the fort and beating them even as
they were bound head and foot. "Mr. Lindh was hit in the back of the
head by one of the soldiers," his lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that Lindh noticed Spann. The encounter is emerging as
a key part of the trial: Prosecutors allege that Lindh's failure to
warn Spann his life was in danger led to his death.</TE>
<TE>   "Lindh saw two Anglo-looking men walking among the detained
soldiers," the lawyers said. "One was dressed in a long Afghan shirt
and carried a large gun and a video camera. The other, later
identified as Johnny Michael Spann, was wearing a black shirt and
jeans; he had a gun and a small camera."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers said the CIA pair were "singling out prisoners for
individual interrogation" and that Lindh "assumed they were working
with" the Northern Alliance. One of the agents gave orders to the
alliance guards, "who readily complied." They did not intervene in
the torture, lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   And when the agents singled out Lindh for questioning, not only
did they not identify themselves, but a Northern Alliance guard "kept
his gun trained on Mr. Lindh," the lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Later there was an explosion and a prison uprising. Spann was
killed and Lindh was wounded in the right thigh.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh hid in a basement with other Taliban prisoners until they
were forced to surrender Dec. 1.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent days, Lindh was blindfolded and tied to a gurney,
kept in a metal container and deprived of food and water, the defense
said. When he asked who was holding him prisoner, he was told it was
not Americans but the Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Other times, the defense said, Lindh was humiliated. "Frequently,
U.S. military personnel taunted Mr. Lindh with derogatory epithets."</TE>
<TE>   Still later, soldiers scrawled a profanity across his blindfold
and took photographs of themselves with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Another told Mr. Lindh [a Muslim convert] he was 'going to hang'
for his actions and that after he was dead, the soldier would sell
the photographs and give the money to a Christian organization.
Another told Mr. Lindh he wanted to shoot him there and then."</TE>
<TE>   On occasion, while tied to a stretcher, his guards refused to
release him when he needed to urinate but "instead propped up the
stretcher to a vertical position," the documents said.</TE>
<TE>   And when he asked for a lawyer, he was told "there are no lawyers
here," the defense said.</TE>

<HD>Historically, Laws Bend in Time of War, Rehnquist Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: Chief justice contends judges are inclined to back
the government in crises. Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus is
cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, reviewing the history of civil
liberties during wartime, said Friday that the courts are inclined to
bend the law in the government's favor during a time of hostilities.</LD>
<LD>   ''One is reminded of the Latin maxim, inter arma silent leges. In
time of war, the laws are silent,'' Rehnquist said in a speech to
federal judges meeting in Williamsburg, Va.</LD>
<LD>   He cited as examples President Lincoln's suspension of the right
to habeas corpus during the Civil War and the Supreme Court's
willingness to uphold the internment of Japanese Americans and the
secret military trial of eight Nazi saboteurs during World War II.</LD>
<TE>   After the Civil War, the Supreme Court unanimously overruled the
Union's use of a military trial to condemn several Confederate
sympathizers in Indiana. And Congress later apologized for the
Japanese internment, but long after the war was over.</TE>
<TE>   "These cases suggest that, while the laws are surely not silent in
time of war, courts may interpret them differently then than in time
of peace,'' Rehnquist said.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed he was offering ''only a historical perspective,'' not
a prediction on how the high court will handle civil liberties
complaints that arise from the Bush administration's war on
terrorism, which has not formally been declared.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the chief justice has made it clear he believes it is
unrealistic to expect judges to boldly challenge the government's
action at a time when a threat to the nation's security is real.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a new topic for Rehnquist. A history buff, he wrote a
1998 book on civil liberties in wartime, titled ''All the Laws but
One.''</TE>
<TE>   He recounted the infringements on civil liberties during the Civil
War and the two world wars, and concluded that the nation's respect
for civil liberties has grown steadily. Still, it is true that the
demands of war have outweighed the commitment to civil liberties, at
least while the conflict is underway, he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Rehnquist cited Hawaii's imposition of martial law
after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Even though the bars and
restaurants reopened shortly afterward, the civilian courts remained
closed by military order through most of the war, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Duncan, a civilian shipyard worker, was arrested and tried
before a military court after getting into a fight with two guards at
the Pearl Harbor base. Harry White, a stockbroker, was also convicted
in a military court for embezzling funds from a client.</TE>
<TE>   Both men filed writs of habeas corpus challenging their
convictions. The Supreme Court took up their appeals, and in the case
of Duncan vs. Kahanamoku, ruled that Hawaii's military trials for
civilians were unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   ''The good news for the defendants, and perhaps for the people of
Hawaii, was that martial law was illegal there at the time these
defendants were tried in 1943,'' Rehnquist said. ''The bad news was
that they did not find out about it until February 1946, a half year
after the end of the war with Japan.''</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Jose Padilla, the accused ''dirty" bomb plotter, is
expected to file a writ of habeas corpus challenging his detention in
a military brig in Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   The writ claims that Padilla, a U.S. citizen, is being held
unconstitutionally, and it asks a federal judge to grant the writ and
release the detainee.</TE>
<TE>   Such a writ can be acted upon immediately by a judge. If the writ
is rejected, lawyers for Padilla could send an appeal up through the
court system. Similarly, if the writ is granted, Bush administration
lawyers would appeal immediately.</TE>

<HD>Chicago's Blues for R. Kelly</HD>
<DH>The R&amp;B singer, charged with child pornography, lives in
and loves his hometown, but many supporters have had enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The voice on the other end of the phone was tiny and wounded, nothing
like the supple tenor that made R. Kelly the most popular R&amp;B singer
of his generation. He said he was sitting in front of a television
watching Mike Tyson's boxing career descend to a bloody, pitiful low,
but it was a feeble distraction from his own battles against
prosecutors and public opinion.</LD>
<LD>   "Terrible, that's how I'm doing, just terrible," rasped the
singer, who faces 21 felony counts of child pornography, charges that
carry a potential penalty of 15 years in prison. The charges stem
from a home video that allegedly shows him in sexual liaisons with
several partners, including a lurid encounter three years ago with a
14-year-old girl. He denied the charges in an arraignment June 6 and
is free after posting $750,000 bond.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly hung up the phone and returned to the refuge of a friend's
home here. If Kelly is found guilty, his name will be lumped with
Jerry Lee Lewis, Gary Glitter, Roman Polanski and other celebrities
who have seduced minors. But, no matter the verdict, Chicago is
already struggling with the fall from grace of one of its favored
sons.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Sylvester Kelly, 35, grew up poor on the Southside but
never strayed far. Even when he scored more Top 40 hits than any
other male solo artist in the 1990s, you could find him most nights
playing basketball with old buddies not far from his childhood home.
With his recording studio in the shadow of the Cabrini Green housing
projects, he was on a short list of stars in a big city. He will be
tried here now too, for allegedly filming a sexual escapade police
say took place in the sauna room of his Olympia Field home.</TE>
<TE>   "There's Michael Jordan, there's Oprah Winfrey and there's R.
Kelly," says Derrel McDavid, who grew up on the Southside and is
Kelly's longtime friend and business manager. "After that, who's
next? This is a guy who rides around the streets of Chicago, plays
basketball here, records his music here. He never wanted to leave,
but now it looks like he has to. Maybe Chicago is not his home
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   A young Kelly often lugged an electronic keyboard into subway
tunnels, playing for the loose change of commuters. Years later he
would be a superstar, with more than 14 million albums sold and such
hits as "I Believe I Can Fly," which won a Grammy in 1996. Kelly's
talents as a producer and songwriter too also made him coveted, and
he has worked with Michael Jackson, Celine Dion and Jay-Z.</TE>
<TE>   All along, Kelly's music was jolting in its dichotomy: His soaring
songs were heroic enough to accompany the exploits of Batman and
Muhammad Ali on film, but in concert he would follow them with a song
in which he sings to a woman, "I like the crotch in you."</TE>
<TE>   To Gerald M. Margolis, who has been Kelly's entertainment attorney
for years, the split was the "conflict of the profane and the
religious that goes back to Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard and Elvis
Presley." But McDavid sensed there was a personal struggle in the
lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "A man who is torn," McDavid said, his eyes moist from analyzing
his friend's tumble. "Torn and trying to figure himself out."</TE>
<TE>   The citizenry of Chicago has also been trying to figure Kelly out.
Many have decided he is a crass predator disguised by false piety and
celebrity. Popular Chicago station WBBM-FM has yanked him from the
airwaves. A boycott of Kelly's music has been organized by the Rev.
Bamani Obadele, a community activist, and some local leaders describe
Kelly's crisis in terms of civic betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate to see Mr. Kelly's talents go to waste," Chicago
Police Supt. Terry Hilliard said at a news conference to announce the
grand jury indictment against Kelly. "But it becomes a tragedy when
... involving harmful acts which damage and degrade our children
[and] diminish the integrity of our entire community."</TE>
<TE>   Those closest to Kelly say it is the community that has betrayed
the singer. They say the star stayed too close to his roots, making
himself vulnerable to a plot to destroy him. Some claim a shadowy
figure in the singer's recent past set out to ruin Kelly by
distributing the tape on the eve of the R&amp;B star's performance at the
Winter Olympics opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert has done some foolish things," Margolis said. "But he has
also been dramatically victimized. People have stolen from him,
attempted to extort him, vilify him.... He allowed them extraordinary
access."</TE>
<TE>   But even if someone intended to harm Kelly, to many that will be
inconsequential if the singer is indeed the man on the videotape. FBI
experts will testify that the tape has not been doctored, and
prosecutors say that Kelly is clearly recognizable on it.</TE>
<TE>   Those prosecutors will have to prove their child pornography case
without the help of the girl in question--she and her parents have
denied that she is the one in the footage. Last week state
authorities said they will investigate whether the girl's parents
allowed her to be in a relationship with Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly says he will not watch the tape.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, if it's as disgusting as people say it is and as
crazy as people say it is, I have no interest in seeing some man with
a woman whether she's underage or not underage," the singer told MTV
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly becomes the latest in a seemingly endless parade of
celebrities to march through the gantlet of scandal. Some salvage
their career, others disappear. Michael Jackson, for instance, was
never criminally charged with child molestation, but the lawsuits and
rumors have tainted his career nonetheless. Polanski, meanwhile,
lives abroad and is considered a fugitive from the U.S., but he was
feted at this year's Cannes Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   In the music world, many of the stars who have worked with Kelly
have shied away from visible stances on the matter, while others,
such as rapper Nas, have taken public shots at the singer. Jay-Z, a
rapper who this year released a high-profile collaboration with
Kelly, has refused to promote the album or even be photographed with
the R&amp;B singer, and sales of the disc have slumped. Dr. Dre echoed
many when, in a television interview, he said he had not seen the
tape, nor did he want to, but he did offer a career prediction: "If
he's guilty, it's over."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has a response: In the weeks before his arrest, he wrote and
recorded a new song, "Heaven I Need a Hug," which finds him
delivering honeyed lines with a tremble in his voice:</TE>
<TE>   "I gave 13 years of my life to this industry.</TE>
<TE>   Hit song or not, I've given all of me.</TE>
<TE>   You smile in my face and tell me you love me,</TE>
<TE>   But then before you know the truth you're so quick to judge me."</TE>
<TE>   McDavid, Kelly's friend and business manager, a man with a steady
gaze who wears a large diamond-studded cross on a necklace, is
sentimental enough to tear up as he recounts how Kelly sang to
McDavid's dying mother, and practical enough to order the singer's
bodyguards to check the age of every woman he now meets. McDavid
parked his sport utility vehicle along a bustling sidewalk in
downtown Chicago one night last week and listened to the new song on
his car stereo. Again, his voice grew thick with emotion. "Rob has
given everything. He's got a good heart."</TE>
<TE>   McDavid said the new track may be informally released to Chicago
radio stations soon. It will also be included on Kelly's next album,
"Loveland," which Jive Records has slated for November. The label,
Kelly's home for more than a decade, has issued only brief statements
of support for the singer and has not addressed its plans for Kelly's
future releases.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the singer has been accused of an
improper relationship with an underage partner. He has twice settled
lawsuits by Chicago women who claimed they, as minors, had sex with
him. A third lawsuit is pending. In 1994, he reportedly was married
for a short time to the late R&amp;B singer Aaliyah when she was 15.
Kelly produced Aaliyah's first album, which made her a star. The
title of the disc: "Age Ain't Nothing but a Number."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Community Divided Over a Man's Sins</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is now married to a 28-year-old former dancer from his
touring troupe. They have a newborn son and two young daughters.</TE>
<TE>   The R. Kelly saga has evoked especially passionate and divided
sentiments in Chicago's black neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   One local state congressional candidate has said the scandal
should inspire soul-searching in the black community about the
unspoken acceptance of adults dating underage girls, and local
pundits have cited the proliferation in American pop culture of
sexualized images of teen girls, especially young black girls, and
the tacit approval of their exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   At a gospel music festival in Grant Park last Sunday, the mention
of Kelly's name elicited instant and often passionate responses from
audience members and performers. Some offered prayers for the singer
or the family of the young girl allegedly involved. Others indicted
Kelly or the world that he lives in.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's been talking about it," said Mable Stone, a
77-year-old native of the city. She has seen parts of the tape
herself. "You can't avoid it. The whole thing just makes me sick. He
was all right for a while, but now all this vulgar stuff. That's what
happens: They get famous, they get money and they just lose their
minds."</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, in suburban Matteson, more than 300 people,
almost all of them African American women, gathered at a Holiday Inn
for a hair fashion show. The exhibitions were staged productions that
often recalled music videos, and none was more topical or ambitious
than the one organized by Sharon Payton, or Ms. Sha Sha as she is
known to customers of Trenz, her Southside salon.</TE>
<TE>   "We use all R. Kelly music, about 12 songs," she explained. "I'm
his biggest fan. We use the new version of 'I Believe I Can Fly,' the
one where Robert asks God to forgive him for all of his unrighteous
ways."</TE>
<TE>   During the show, Payton, clad entirely in white, played the role
of her favorite singer, ascending to the door of heaven and seeking
admission as his music blared.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone said we should send a tape of it to Robert," she said.
"R. Kelly's music, though, has touched so many people. And he grew up
here. So we got his back, no matter what." *</TE>
<TE>   A Question of Image and the Voice Inside</TE>
<TE>   There are three typical R. Kelly images in his promotional photos
and videos: scowling street tough, thoughtful man of prayer, sinewy
bedroom vamp. The first, said business manager McDavid, is a fiction
of sorts, an attempt by Kelly to reflect his old neighborhood, not
his own personality. As for the second, Kelly only recently began
attending church regularly. His longtime publicist, Regina Daniels,
is hopeful that that will bring him some calm. "He is not an angel,
I'll tell you that. But he also isn't the monster they are making him
out to be."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly told MTV last month that "I got a lot that's in me that I'm
dealing with personally, and I'm seeking help."</TE>
<TE>   Lena McLin, one of Kelly's music teachers at Kenwood Academy in
Hyde Park, is happy to hear that her former student may be
gravitating more to churches than to nightclubs. After decades of
recording her pupils, the back room of her apartment is a library of
teenagers warbling show tunes and straining through arias. She played
one for a visitor. The first two songs are crisp performances by 13-
and 14-year-olds. The third is a solo by young Robert Kelly. The
phrasing, the range and the confidence of the boy cut through the
static of the aging recording and the scandal of today. "Just a
child," McLin says. "So rich in voice. Can you believe that is just a
child?"</TE>
<TE>   She saw and heard something special in the lanky youngster ("You
always know. You just do.") special enough that she sabotaged the
choir student's membership on the basketball team. She said Kelly was
furious at first, but after a bravura performance of a Stevie Wonder
song at a school talent show, he changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when he had become a star student, she visited his home to
lobby for the youngster to travel to Atlanta to sing at a tribute to
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The teacher remembers being struck by
the family's poverty. "It was bare. One table, two chairs. There was
no father there, I knew that, and they had very little." Was Kelly a
tough kid? "He was respectful, shy sometimes. He was not the
troublemaker."</TE>
<TE>   In the corner of McLin's apartment is a leaning stack of framed
platinum records, sent by Kelly as souvenirs of his stardom. Another
gift is the white grand piano that dominates her living room and
sends music down to the leafy children's park below her windows. She
agreed to play a jaunty composition she wrote years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "That friend who serves</TE>
<TE>   And seeks for gain</TE>
<TE>   Will follow just for form,</TE>
<TE>   Will pack when it begins to rain,</TE>
<TE>   And leave you in the storm."</TE>
<TE>   "That song," she said, "is for Robert now."</TE>

<HD>Sect Leader Found Guilty in Son's Starvation Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: It was God's will to deprive the infant of food,
Jacques Robidoux says. He'll spend his life in prison for
first-degree murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Though he tearfully insisted that he was merely following God's will,
a jury on Friday convicted Jacques Robidoux, 29, of first-degree
murder in the starvation death of his infant son.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without
possibility of parole.</LD>
<LD>   Robidoux, a leader of a small fundamentalist sect known as the
Body, had told jurors this week that he believed a miracle might save
the boy, who was deprived of solid food for 51 days. Samuel Robidoux
died April 26, 1999, three days before his first birthday.</LD>
<TE>   Following a prophesy--or what the group called "a leading"--from
God to his sister, Michelle Mingo, Robidoux ordered that his healthy
young son be fed nothing but breast milk. His wife, Karen, already
pregnant with another child, was told to consume only a potion made
from water and crushed almonds.</TE>
<TE>   The happy baby--who, one witness said, was about to start walking
and would eat "anything that was put before him"--soon stopped
crawling and slipped into a near-skeletal state of emaciation.</TE>
<TE>   "He began losing weight," Robidoux testified in the Taunton,
Mass., courtroom. "His cry wasn't a normal baby's cry. He would grind
his teeth. Toward the end he would often bite down on [his mother's]
nipple. Sometimes his eyes would roll to the back of his head."</TE>
<TE>   Samuel's body was found buried in a remote section of Baxter State
Park in northern Maine. Also uncovered was the body of a stillborn
child of another sect member, Rebecca Corneau.</TE>
<TE>   Mingo, who will be tried separately as an accessory after the
fact, said she received her instructions from God as punishment for
Karen Robidoux's vanity and pridefulness. Prosecutors said Mingo was
jealous of Karen Robidoux, who earned a reputation for vanity because
she closely watched her weight.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Robidoux is scheduled to be tried this year on a charge of
second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Attleboro, Mass., the sect's three dozen members shun
modern medicine, law, government, education and the arts. They live
communally and support themselves through a contracting business.</TE>
<TE>   The group puts such faith in God that when members ran out of gas
on an outing to Maine, they all put their hands on the hoods of their
cars, praying for their tanks to be refilled. They stayed in their
cars for three days before police found them and escorted them to a
gas station.</TE>
<TE>   A former member, Daniel Horton, testified that a "leading" was
accepted as a divine vision that could not be questioned. "We had to
take it as if the Apostle Paul said it, and we would have to do it,
whatever it was," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Horton, who testified under a grant of immunity, said he
challenged Jacques Robidoux about denying food to Samuel because he
had heard of a woman in New York whose baby died under similar
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me that was from Satan," Horton said. "And in his exact
words, 'and besides, I know that Samuel is not going to die.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Robidoux himself told the court that his son grew weaker by
the day.</TE>
<TE>   "You made the decision, day after day, week after week [to
deprive] your child of solid food?" asked prosecutor Walter Shea.</TE>
<TE>   Robidoux, with his hair trimmed short and his long beard shaved
off, answered: "The buck stops here."</TE>
<TE>   His testimony was buttressed by writings in a diary introduced by
prosecutors. Robidoux's brother-in-law said he found the diary wedged
between two Bibles on a shelf in one of the group's communal homes.
In court, Robidoux identified the journal as his. In one entry soon
after he began withholding solid food from his 10-month-old son,
Robidoux wrote, "Samuel is obviously thirsty and hungry." His wife
was having trouble expressing enough milk to satisfy the infant.</TE>
<TE>   "Karen cannot bear what is happening because Samuel is crying so
much," the diary entry continued.</TE>
<TE>   Shea, the prosecutor, read jurors an entry from one week later.</TE>
<TE>   "Satan used the physical sight of Samuel to get to [Karen]," he
wrote. "He was obviously losing much weight and becoming much
weaker."</TE>
<TE>   Deliberating for a day and a half, the jury rejected defense
arguments that the baby died of scurvy or rickets.</TE>

<KH>DODGER-ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wall Is Cut, Shields Promoted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels, finding nothing to their liking in the trade market,
started their bullpen makeover Friday by releasing right-hander Donne
Wall and promoting right-hander Scot Shields from triple-A Salt Lake.</LD>
<LD>   "The guys we could get now aren't guys that could make us better,"
General Manager Bill Stoneman said. "If the guys we can get are no
better than the guys we have at Salt Lake, we'll go with the guys we
have at Salt Lake."</LD>
<LD>   The Angels had no interest in left-hander Bruce Chen, traded
Friday from the Montreal Expos to the Cincinnati Reds. The Angels
probably could get left-hander Graeme Lloyd from the Expos for
outfielder Julio Ramirez. They have some interest in left-hander Alan
Embree of the San Diego Padres and right-hander Mike Fetters of the
Pittsburgh Pirates. As the July 31 trading deadline approaches and
more teams conclude a playoff berth is out of reach this season, more
pitchers will become available.</LD>
<TE>   For now, the Angels will take a look at Shields, mostly in long
relief. Shields, 26, pitched 47 innings at Salt Lake, more than any
of the Angel relievers. He struck out 50, walked six and posted a
3.06 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels still would like to add a second left-hander and/or
hard-throwing right-hander to their bullpen. The latter role could
eventually be filled by top prospect Francisco Rodriguez, 20,
promoted Friday to Salt Lake. He struck out 61 in 41 innings at
double-A Arkansas. The Angels also will consider Salt Lake
right-handers Brendan Donnelly and Bart Miadich.</TE>
<TE>   Wall, 34, had a 6.43 ERA overall but a 1.93 ERA since he was
activated from the disabled list May 20. The Angels are more
comfortable with right-handers Al Levine (10 hits in his past seven
innings), Lou Pote (14 hits in his past 11 innings) and Ben Weber
(eight hits in his past five innings), all of whom excelled last
year, but their recent troubles helped cost Wall his job.</TE>
<TE>   "This move was made mainly because of the recent struggles of our
bullpen," Stoneman said. "Had the other guys been a little stronger
over the past week to 10 days, this might not have happened."</TE>

<HD>Angels' Ortiz Does the Job Solo</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He gives up four hits to Dodgers, all solo
homers, and Anaheim wins, 8-4. Ishii gets knocked out early.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California sports fans received a rare treat Friday night, a
meaningful June game that wasn't dressed in Laker purple and gold.
This one, for a change, wore Dodger blue and Angel ... let's see,
what color is it again this year? Oh yeah, red.</LD>
<LD>   Bright red. A Big-Red-Machine kind of red. A
circle-the-bases-until-your-eyes-are-bloodshot kind of red, which is
what the Dodgers were seeing during an 8-4 interleague loss to the
Angels before 51,722 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Angel right-hander Ramon Ortiz gave up four solo home runs,
increasing his major league-total to 22 homers allowed--18 of them
solo--but those were the only hits he gave up in a complete-game,
eight-strikeout, one-walk performance that improved his record to 7-5
and pushed his complete-game total to three.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels, who improved to 33-11 over the last 44 games, remained
a game behind first-place Seattle in the American League West, while
the Dodgers remained a game behind Arizona in the National League
West.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of guys in the Hall of Fame who have given up a
ton of solo home runs," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "So we're
not concerned."</TE>
<TE>   There was reason for the Dodgers to be concerned about starter
Kazuhisa Ishii. The Angels rocked the Japanese left-hander for six
runs on seven hits in three innings, handing him his second loss, and
Ishii (10-2) didn't help himself by committing a crucial error in the
third, walking four and throwing two wild pitches that allowed two
runs to score.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy has given Ishii a long leash, because Ishii has
a knack for escaping jams, but he pulled his starter with no outs in
the fourth, Ishii's shortest outing of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not see anything to make me inclined to think he would get
through tonight," Tracy said. "His command was erratic, and things
unraveled following his double-play feed to second base .... They
took advantage of a couple situations that we created for them."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii had a 1-0 lead, thanks to Eric Karros' home run to left
field in the second, but he made a mess of things in the third and
fourth. After Darin Erstad singled and Troy Glaus was hit by a pitch
to open the third, Anderson hit a potential double-play ball back to
the mound. Ishii threw low to second and the Angels had the bases
loaded.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii then bounced a ball past catcher Paul Lo Duca for a wild
pitch, allowing Erstad to score. Ishii broke Tim Salmon's bat with a
pitch, but Salmon got enough of it to ground a two-run single up the
middle for a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein walked to open the Angel fourth, and Erstad, who is
batting .364 (36 for 99) on the road, laced his third single of the
game to right-center, advancing Eckstein to third.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii then threw a pitch that was so wild it bounced past Lo Duca
and into the sixth row of seats next to the Dodger dugout, allowing
Eckstein to score for 4-1 lead. Glaus singled to right, Erstad
stopping at third, and Tracy yanked Ishii for Guillermo Mota.
Anderson's sacrifice fly made it 5-1, and Bengie Molina capped the
rally with an RBI single for a 6-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's team-leading 14th home run, a towering shot to center,
made it 7-1 in the sixth before Alex Cora and Shawn Green homered in
the sixth, making it 7-3. Salmon doubled and scored on Terry
Mulholland's wild pitch for an Angel insurance run in the ninth, and
Green hit his 18th homer of the season to left-center in the bottom
of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers survived a scary moment in the sixth, when four
players--three Dodgers and one Angel--collided on Salmon's foul popup
toward first.</TE>
<TE>   As Salmon jogged toward first and Karros rushed in, Salmon clipped
Karros in the leg and sent the first baseman sprawling. Lo Duca and
Mota scrambled for the ball, Lo Duca making the catch while stumbling
into his pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric had the wind knocked out of him," Tracy said. "That was
quite a collision. There were a lot of bodies all over the field."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "They just clanged like symbols."</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Rampage (2000)--0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Both teams are coming off humbling defeats. Los Angeles
was pounded, 52-33, by San Jose, its second consecutive loss. Grand
Rapids was trampled by New Jersey, 70-42, ending its four-game
winning streak. But the Rampage is the defending Arena league
champion and knows what it takes to make the playoffs. The Avengers
are still trying to find their way into the postseason. Los Angeles
quarterback Tony Graziani (166 of 283, 40 touchdowns, nine
interceptions), needs 157 yards and six touchdowns to set
single-season team records. Receiver Greg Hopkins (58 receptions, 716
yards, 14 touchdowns) is on pace for his third consecutive 100-catch
season. Offensive specialist Chris Jackson did not make the trip
because of an injured right hamstring. Rampage quarterback Clint
Dolezel has completed 197 of 280 passes (70.4%) for 46 touchdowns
with 13 interceptions.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Griffey Jr. is expected to sit out the Cincinnati Reds' weekend
series against the Pittsburgh Pirates because his strained right
hamstring is still bothering him.</LD>
<LD>   Griffey took batting practice Friday but was out of the starting
lineup for the sixth consecutive game. He injured the hamstring while
running to first base against the Angels last Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Griffey had a precautionary MRI that showed only a strain. Last
season he tore the other hamstring and was limited to 111 games.</LD>
<TE>   Griffey tore a tendon in his right knee on April 7 and was on the
disabled list for six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Joe Kennedy of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays was suspended for
seven games and fined an undisclosed amount for intentionally
throwing at Toronto's Ken Huckaby during a 5-4 loss to the Blue Jays
on June 6.... Chicago Cub pitcher Carlos Zambrano was suspended for
five games and fined an undisclosed amount for his actions during a
bench-clearing brawl June 4 in a triple-A game in Utah. Zambrano was
on an injury rehab assignment for the Iowa Cubs.... Left-hander Bruce
Chen was traded from the Montreal Expos to the Reds, who gave up
right-handed reliever Jim Brower. Chen made five starts and 10 relief
appearances, going 2-3 with a 6.99 earned-run average.</TE>

<HD>It's a Sea Change on Beach</HD>
<DH>Volleyball: Revamped AVP, which has tournament in Santa
Barbara this weekend, is winning back fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Center court was packed, 3,500 people crowded like sardines into the
bleachers and crammed together on the sand, as the tightly wound
men's final at the Hermosa Beach Open went on and on and on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It was a sunny day for beach volleyball, perhaps even more so for
the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals, which moves to Santa Barbara
today and Sunday for its third tournament this season.</LD>
<LD>   The AVP, purchased last year by sports agent Leonard Armato, might
have started to clear away the malaise that characterized the tour
for several years as dwindling finances and popularity forced it to
declare bankruptcy in November 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Using an aggressive marketing campaign that includes a weekly
radio show and the televising of two tournaments on NBC in August,
word has filtered out about the AVP.</TE>
<TE>   "We're feeling momentum built every day," Armato said. "The first
two events have exceeded our expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Armato points to the men's final at Hermosa, and not so much the
jammed center court but the throng of fans who watched on an adjacent
big-screen TV because they couldn't get close enough to see Albert
Hannemann and Jeff Nygaard defeat Kevin Wong and Stein Metzger.</TE>
<TE>   "We had literally thousands of people watching the event out on
the promenade," Armato said. "That's something that's encouraging.
We're delighted by the support the fans are showing."</TE>
<TE>   Karch Kiraly, beach volleyball's all-time victory leader with 142
championships, senses a similar shift in direction for the AVP.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen crowds like this in a number of years, maybe
since 1995-96," he said. "I think the tour is catching peoples'
attention again."</TE>
<TE>   It's a statement that can't go unnoticed in light of Kiraly's
reluctance to play for the AVP after Armato acquired it.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly had been adamantly opposed to the AVP adopting
international rules of play, including smaller courts and
rally-scored games.</TE>
<TE>   But with the AVP in its second year with the new rules, Kiraly,
41, has adapted.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Armato] came around as the white knight, I agonized over
whether I wanted to throw my support behind a tour that would change
quite a bit," Kiraly said. "I was reassured in discussions with him
that the tour would be built back up, but the rules changes would
have meant the disappearance of traditional volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that it's wise to comply and not have to worry about
political battles and spend our energy to build this tour back up. I
think the hard work [by the AVP] is starting to pay off. It's evident
in the first two tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly, who grew up in Santa Barbara and has won six tournaments
there, will play with Brent Doble this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The news isn't cheery for everybody: Brian Lewis will not play
because of a quadriceps injury he suffered Sunday in a semifinal at
Hermosa. Lewis' partner, Scott Ayakatubby, will team with Casey
Jennings.</TE>
<TE>   While the men's tournament has been somewhat unpredictable, the
women's team of Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs won its first two
tournaments with ease, winning all 10 of its matches, nine in the
minimum two games.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs each have something to prove at Santa Barbara
after their performance there last year. McPeak, who was with Lisa
Arce at the time, lost in a semifinal, as did Youngs, with Barbra
Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   "We both had disappointing tournaments," Youngs said. "This will
be a chance to win three tournaments in a row [in a season], and I've
never done that."</TE>

<HD>After Beating Russia, Belgium Gets Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In some cultures, including certain Far East countries and Belgium, a
tie is considered the most honorable of sporting results. But in
Japan, at least during this World Cup, a tie means only one point at
a time when three are available--soccer's equivalent of the local
train in the land of the bullet train.</LD>
<LD>   So it was with no small amount of irony that Belgium, 0-0-5 in its
previous five World Cup matches, finally won a game Friday and
qualified for the second round because its opponent decided to play
for a tie.</LD>
<LD>   Needing only a point for a berth in the second round, Russia chose
to fall back and protect a 1-1 score and was stung--yielding two
goals in the last 12 minutes as Belgium rallied for a 3-2 victory in
Shizuoka.</LD>
<TE>   The victory was Belgium's first in eight World Cup matches, a
drought extending to the first round of the 1994 event. Belgium tied
three of its matches in 1998 and drew with Japan and Tunisia here.
But when substitute Wesley Sonck scored in the 78th minute and
captain Marc Wilmots followed suit four minutes later, the Belgians
had a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Russia countered with an 86th-minute goal by Dmitri Sychev but ran
out of time to muster another.</TE>
<TE>   "The game was very tense, but it is a pity that the way we played
the game today was an indication of our level," Russia assistant
coach Sergei Pavlov said. "Toward the end, we were trying to keep the
score as it was, and that harmed us."</TE>
<TE>   Belgium, which placed second in Group H at 1-0-2 behind Japan,
will face Brazil on Monday in Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   "We had two draws and one win, scoring six goals. We showed we are
not a team you can just throw away," Belgian Coach Robert Waseige
said.</TE>

<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>So they played the U.S. Open and a flood broke out. It was supposed
to rain Friday and it did just that, which meant that the second
round at Bethpage Black would be a soggy, chilly mess.</LD>
<LD>   Because Tiger Woods lives a charmed life, he enjoyed a slightly
different experience. It rained on Tiger, but it was only sort of a
sprinkle, and he was already safe and warm when it started coming
down really hard in midafternoon.</LD>
<LD>   It's obvious that Tiger knows how to handle the elements. He can
play on sunny days and he can play when they're breaking out the
lifeboats along the fairways. Through the raindrops, Woods birdied
his closing hole for the second day in a row to end with a 68 and
take a three-shot lead over the drenched guy closest to him.</LD>
<TE>   Woods did make one concession to the rain, when he turned his cap
around to make a putt so the water wouldn't run off the brim and
bother him.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone should be so lucky to be as waterproof as Tiger.
Actually, Bethpage Black held up well under the worsening conditions.
But you had to wonder what would happen to the bunkers when you add a
downpour to the 900,000 tons of sand they brought in. Would it become
quicksand or oatmeal?</TE>
<TE>   David Fay, the executive director of the U.S. Golf Assn., is no
weatherman, but he certainly didn't feel like making any excuses
about the rain. That's why Fay patiently explained that golf is
played outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes there is sun, sometimes there is fog, sometimes there
are clouds and sometime it's wetter than bath time.</TE>
<TE>   When Sergio Garcia played the 18th hole, a tiny creek had formed
and was flowing from the green back down the fairway. He must have
felt like an explorer. If the discovery of new bodies of water
bothered Garcia, he didn't let on, but he surely must have had wet
hands with all the gripping and regripping he was doing.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia also should have fetched a towel from his caddie to dry off
the head of his club, which had to be soaked after all the time he
was spending with his grip, but then he would have had to start all
over again with the grip thing.</TE>
<TE>   The grounds crew used squeegees to get the water off the greens
and the tee areas, but that was not the most important piece of
equipment for the players. Nor was it any single club. It was an
umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   There are two things about golf umbrellas: They are ugly and they
are huge. They are so big because they are designed for two people,
the player and his caddie, who is in charge of keeping the clubs dry.
If there's not enough room for the clubs, the caddie steps aside.</TE>
<TE>   Umbrellas become hand-held towel racks. The caddies hang white
towels from the spokes underneath and use them to dry clubs and also
to wipe away the tears from trying to control the direction of a shot
while you're standing on a sponge.</TE>
<TE>   As the day wore on, the entire Bethpage Black course became an
undeclared water hazard. There were few defenses, but the players
took as many precautions to prevent drowning, exposure, pneumonia or
possibly something even worse, the double bogey.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Miller chose an all-dark ensemble of foul-weather gear,
topped off by a black hat with a narrow, turned-down, floppy brim,
and finished with white shoes. He looked either like a cold front or
one of the Sopranos.</TE>
<TE>   Niclas Fasth of Sweden was bundled up tightly and almost certainly
would have been just as comfortable carrying skis and waiting at the
bottom of a slope for the lift.</TE>
<TE>   Because he is from Northern Ireland, burly Darren Clarke knows all
about cold summer weather, and he buttoned up his jacket to one of
his chins.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a brief sighting of South African Retief Goosen,
the defending champion, just before he shot a round of 75 and missed
the cut.</TE>
<TE>   All you could see of Goosen were his two arms and his golf club
sticking out of a grove of trees. The arms chopped the ball from the
trees into a wet thatch of knee-high rough. Goosen wore only a
waterproof windbreaker and a grim expression.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Van de Velde wore a sweater and a short-sleeve shirt. It's
obvious the Frenchman doesn't care about getting wet, which we have
known about since he took off his shoes and climbed into that creek
at Carnoustie a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the players, maybe the most enthusiastically dressed for
the rain was Rocco Mediate. Here is a man with a sense of style, a
renaissance Rain Man.</TE>
<TE>   Mediate wore a black golf cap and on top of that, a fisherman's
cap. Everybody knows two hats are better than one. Or something like
that.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the sky was as dark as a bogey, Rocco donned
wraparound shades. He also stuck a tee between his teeth, like a
toothpick. With his black vest and white shirt, he could have been a
character out of Dr. Seuss.</TE>
<TE>   But after taking so many precautions to stay dry in the rain,
Rocco refused to be an eccentric peg in a square hole. He didn't wear
a glove.</TE>
<TE>   So his hands weren't dry, big deal. Just grab something from the

<LD>The surprising showing of the U.S. soccer team in the World Cup is
because of one man, says Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post:</LD>
<LD>   "All credit goes to [Coach] Bruce Arena, who went into the World
Cup pooh-poohing his own team and praising everybody else's. He's
like Lou Holtz--except his pants don't flap in the wind.</LD>
<LD>   "Now soccer is so hot, everybody wants to get up and watch the
U.S. play. If Arena can create 'appointment viewing' at these ungodly
hours, he can dump soccer and jump directly to network vice president
in charge of programming."</LD>
<TE>   Not his bag: Tiger Woods was asked by a British reporter at the
U.S. Open if he had been following the World Cup, and if he had any
favorite players, such as Brazil's Ronaldo, England's David Beckham
or U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel.</TE>
<TE>   Woods just stared back.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got the wrong country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What country has the most all-time World Cup losses?</TE>
<TE>   Mood indigo: Gil LeBreton of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram says it
will take considerable time before 1998 champion France recovers from
its miserable showing at this year's World Cup:</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fate that may not translate as well in America. In
baseball, there's always next year. But in soccer, the World Cup
champion reigns for four glorious years. The adulation--and the
expectations--tend to grow exponentially.</TE>
<TE>   "For the French, it all ended here Tuesday like a bad meal. Adieu,
Les Bleus. They're toast. French toast."</TE>
<TE>   Papal impostor: A man bearing a striking resemblance to Pope John
Paul II showed up at a recent Texas Rangers' game, wearing a white
cassock and shaking hands with fans. He had people wondering,
especially with the Catholic bishops meeting this week in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "He was good, whoever he was," Ranger TV announcer Tom Grieve
said. "I knew he wasn't the pope. I just didn't know whether he might
be a cardinal or a bishop."</TE>
<TE>   Someone in the press box wondered why a bishop would be wearing
white.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we are the home team," Ranger publicist John Blake replied.</TE>
<TE>   New digs: Jerry West, president of basketball operations for the
Memphis Grizzlies, closed on the purchase of a home Wednesday for
$3.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-room English Tudor-style, two-story home includes five
bedrooms, six full bathrooms, three half-bathrooms, a large kitchen,
paneled library, six fireplaces, a weight room and a three-car
garage, on seven acres.</TE>
<TE>   The home is located in the gated community of Southwind, Tenn.,
near the Tournament Players Club--home of the PGA's FedEx St. Jude
Classic--where West presumably will be able to play golf.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Mexico, which has a World Cup record of 10-19-11.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel, commenting on
the difficulty of the Bethpage Black golf course:</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a U.S. Open being played on a public course designed by
Freddy Krueger and used by the Mafia to hide bodies in the rough.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the PGA Tour--plus some amateurs who will serve as chum--in
a special edition of 'Fear Factor'. Granted, none of the pros may end
up covered in rats, but we can hope."</TE>

<HD>Brown: 'Instant Relief' After Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown arrived at Centinela Hospital Medical
Center on June 3, he was asked to rate his lower-back pain on a scale
from one to 10.</LD>
<LD>   "I told them that scale was way off," said Brown, who returned to
Dodger Stadium on Friday after undergoing surgery for a herniated
disk Tuesday. "It didn't go from one to 10. It went from one to eight
and eight to 1,000. It was kind of an exponential growth. I couldn't
function."</LD>
<LD>   Friday, three days after doctors removed a "large" herniation and
a "large number of fragments compressing the nerve" in his lower
back, Brown walked into the Dodger clubhouse under his own power. He
hugged teammate Andy Ashby. He stood upright. He was free of pain.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like night and day," Brown said. "As soon as I got out of
surgery I felt better. I have no doubt in my mind I made the right
decision [to have surgery]. I had instant relief. As soon as I woke
up."</TE>
<TE>   Usually a pumped-up, 6-foot-4, 225-pounder who rarely shows
emotion, the right-hander appeared to have lost at least 20 pounds.
His face was a bit gaunt, and his voice cracked during a 10-minute
meeting with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Normally gung-ho when it comes to bouncing back from injuries--he
returned from major elbow surgery in a mere six months this
season--Brown, 37, seemed humbled by this surgery, which will
sideline him for at least a month and possibly the rest of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how confident he was of pitching again this season, Brown
said, "I'm hopeful. The doctors haven't made any guarantees. If this
is what the Lord has planned for me, I'll do everything I can to take
advantage of it. But I'm not going to put the cart before the horse."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers believed Brown, who will begin a five-step trunk
stabilization program in about two weeks, injured his back while
playfully wrestling with one of his sons at home May 29, but Brown
said that wasn't the case.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is I went to bed and was OK, and the next day I tried
to get out of bed, and it was really bad," said Brown, in the fourth
year of a seven-year, $105-million contract. "I don't think [playing
with his son] had anything to do with it, but the first time I felt
it was that morning."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the injury more likely was caused by the torque his
pitching delivery produces on his lower back. But he has no plans to
alter his motion.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to get rid of the problem so you can return to normal
function," he said. "The doctors tell you that all it can take to do
this is picking up a piece of paper. It's not like you have to be
hard on your body to do this."</TE>

<DH>Intrigue surrounds Clemens' scheduled start today against
Piazza, Mets at Shea</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Clemens' dominating fastball and intimidating pitching style
have made hitters jelly-legged at the plate for more than 18 major
league seasons.</LD>
<LD>   But today, it is the New York Yankees' future Hall of Famer who
finds himself in an unfamiliar jam.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens is scheduled to start at Shea Stadium against the New York
Mets. More to the point, the six-time Cy Young Award winner probably
will bat against them for the first time since his unflinching
pitching approach and aggressive behavior toward Met catcher Mike
Piazza twice split the Big Apple during the 2000 season.</LD>
<TE>   In July of that year, after Piazza had hit home runs against him
in three consecutive games, Clemens nailed Piazza in the head with a
pitch in an interleague game at Yankee Stadium. Three months later,
in Game 2 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, Piazza's bat
shattered while hitting a foul ball against Clemens. The burly
pitcher grabbed the splintered barrel end of the bat and threw it
toward Piazza as the catcher ran up the baseline, spurring a national
debate about Clemens' sanity.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens was fined $50,000 but was spared physical retribution when
Yankee Manager Joe Torre juggled his rotation so that his ace did not
pitch against the Mets in three interleague games at Shea Stadium
last year. But Met fans and the New York media circled today's date
on the calendar weeks ago when it became apparent that Clemens' turn
in the rotation could put him in the batter's box at Shea Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   If that wasn't enough to send New Yorkers over the top, the
pitcher known as the Rocket further fueled his headhunter reputation
last weekend when he hit San Francisco Giant slugger Barry Bonds a
few days after intimating such an act would not be an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Some unidentified Met players told the New York Daily News that
Clemens intentionally hit Bonds so he would be suspended for the
series against the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball thought otherwise. After investigating the
incident, Bob Watson, baseball's dean of discipline, declined to
suspend or fine Clemens, who has hit 132 batters in his career and
knocked countless others off the plate.</TE>
<TE>   If Clemens does start, and bat, many baseball observers believe
that Met Manager Bobby Valentine and starter Shawn Estes will follow
time-honored, but unwritten, baseball rules and throw at Clemens to
avenge the incidents with Piazza, who probably will be crouched
behind the plate calling pitches..</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Clemens--who has never been hit in 16 career
at-bats--said he wasn't worried and blamed the media for keeping the
feud alive.</TE>
<TE>   He has not answered questions from reporters for the last three
days.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to keep defending myself," Clemens told the New York
Times on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   No one in baseball blames Clemens for pitching aggressively
inside. In fact, he is admired as one of the preeminent practitioners
of a once-classic pitching style that has faded as ballparks have
become smaller while salaries and the armor-protected hitters who
earn them have grown to enormous proportions.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go inside, I don't aim the ball, I throw the ball. I turn
it loose," Clemens said before this season. "When you do that, if
you're an eighth of an inch off, you're going to hit guys. It's part
of the game. They don't apologize when they hit balls up the middle."</TE>
<TE>   Some contend that Clemens would be forced to change his style if
he played in the National League and could not hide behind the
designated-hitter rule. But Pedro Martinez never backed down when he
played for the Montreal Expos, and Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson
of the Arizona Diamondbacks are two of the most intimidating pitchers
in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schilling and Johnson are split on how far inside is too
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling, who turned around his career after a long conversation
with Clemens about 11 years ago, told Maxim magazine that he approved
of his role model's conduct in the two incidents with Piazza. He also
said he intentionally throws at hitters.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm really trying to hit a guy, I'll aim for the armpit right
below the rib cage," Schilling said. "It's an impossible spot to get
out of the way. But I'll throw above a guy's shoulders and inside
too. If you don't knock a guy on his [rear] or break his bat when you
throw inside, you've done nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, a four-time Cy Young Award winner, does not go that far.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be able to pitch inside," Johnson told New York Times
columnist Harvey Araton. "For me, though, the intimidation is not in
hitting a guy. It's the fear of it, the not knowing. Once you hit
someone, it's not about intimidation anymore. When you do what
Clemens does, people get ticked off. They feel they have to
retaliate. The point of what you were trying to do is lost."</TE>
<TE>   Fearing retaliation, or trying to make a point, Clemens could very
well step up to the plate today wearing the elbow padding and other
protective paraphernalia that Bonds and other hitters put on before
fearlessly crowding the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "They have so much armor on, they look more like football
players," said Lloyd McClendon, manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   If Clemens is plunked, Steve Blass wonders if he will follow the
lead of Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, one of the most aggressive pitchers
in baseball history. Blass pitched for the Pirates in the 1960s and
early '70s when hitting batters and brushback pitches were more
common and most pitchers accepted the consequences of their actions
without complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember we were playing at St. Louis once, and Willie Stargell
hit a home run off Gibson," Blass said. "The next at-bat, Gibson
buries one in Stargell's ribs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our manager, Danny Murtaugh, just looked over at me, and I nodded
as if to say, 'OK.'</TE>
<TE>   "It took three pitches, but I got Gibson when he came to bat. And
Gibson knew the dance. He went down to first base and it was done."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of baseball etiquette has changed over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, every single time you almost hit a guy, it's like an
ordeal," Angel pitcher Kevin Appier said.</TE>
<TE>   Comments from players of different generations read like a
timeline for the way throwing at batters has, for the most part,
fallen from favor.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Nixon, who broke into the major leagues in 1957 as a catcher
with the Cleveland Indians, said the two purpose pitches were staples
of just about every game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying it was a shooting gallery but it was a given that
sometime during each ballgame someone was going to get hit and
someone was going to get knocked on their [rear] as part of a
message," said Nixon, the Pirates' catching instructor who is in his
50th year in professional baseball. "We didn't have helmets back
then, for God's sake. You're getting hit without helmets and you
still didn't think that much about it."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Grich, a second baseman who came up with the Baltimore
Orioles in 1970 and played 17 seasons in the major leagues, said the
'70s were rife with retribution.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a pretty much accepted that if the guy before you hit a
three-run homer, you really didn't have to swing at the first pitch
because there was a 50-50 chance it was going at your head or at your
ribs," Grich said. "I hit five grand slams in my career, and each
time I came up for my next at-bat I knew I was either going to get
knocked down or take it in the shoulder. That was just part of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   By the late '80s, when Appier began his pro career with the Kansas
City Royals, the brushback pitch was in the process of being brushed
aside.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't nearly like it was in the '70s when people were hitting
people blatantly," said Appier, who is in his 13th major league
season. "We were purpose pitching, but it gradually kind of left when
the bigger dollars got involved and hitters could possibly end up on
the disabled list. People got a lot more sensitive to it."</TE>
<TE>   Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn pitched in his first major
league game in 1998. He is adamant about establishing the inside part
of the plate, but said he has never thrown at a batter.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard all the stories about how Nolan Ryan got mad at a guy
because he bunted on him and [Ryan] hit him and said, 'Don't bunt on
me,' " Washburn said. "That definitely has changed. There's no place
in the game, really, for throwing at people intentionally. That's one
change for the better."</TE>
<TE>   For today at least, Clemens can only hope so.</TE>

<HD>Coliseum Draws No Support From NFL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boosters of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum say the facade of the
79-year-old venue can encase a world-class NFL stadium with
futuristic canopies, palm-tree lined restaurants and luxury suites.
But league power brokers and team owners don't share that vision.</LD>
<LD>   "Trying to put a new dress on an old hooker is not the way I want
to go dancing," Baltimore Raven owner Art Modell said.</LD>
<LD>   With the announcement Friday by the downtown coalition that it
plans to withdraw from the stadium derby, attention turns to the
possibility that the Coliseum might--once again--provide a home for
an NFL team.</LD>
<TE>   But among many questions about the viability of renovating the
Coliseum for that purpose are these: sources of funding, identifying
a developer and the lack of support from Los Angeles Mayor James K.
Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it's the strident nature of comments by team owners and
league executives, and the unmistakable declaration of NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, that most strongly suggest the chances
of the league ever returning to the Coliseum are close to nil.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever the Coliseum is presented as a permanent venue, everyone
[in the owners' meetings] shakes their head and refuses to discuss
it," said an influential team owner, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. He added: "We're not going back to the Coliseum. Anyone
who attempts to do so won't get the support they need."</TE>
<TE>   There is even talk among owners and league executives that any
team interested in relocating to the Coliseum would be barred from
receiving a "G-3" loan, a loan for as much as $150 million that
existing franchises can get from the league for the construction of a
new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   If that loan were denied, it would be crippling to the Coliseum's
hopes of luring a team.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the Coliseum say they have seen the league reverse
its stance on the stadium before. They point to the league owners'
derision of the venue after the Raiders left in 1995, only to see
Tagliabue stand atop the Coliseum steps in 1999, spread his arms and
proclaim the stadium the future home of the league's 32nd team. Of
course, that expansion team later was granted to Houston when Texas
businessman Bob McNair outbid competing Coliseum groups with a
$700-million offer.</TE>
<TE>   The problems plaguing the Coliseum are real and perceived. They
concern the difficulty of tinkering with a historic landmark; the red
tape of dealing with the stadium's governing body, the Coliseum
Commission, which is made up of representatives from the city, county
and state; and the issue of parking in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Coliseum officials say all those problems are either fixable or
the result of misinformation. For example, over the years, the
neighborhood surrounding the Coliseum became less affluent and fell
into neglect. The mere perception the area was unsafe kept fans away
and created problems. In fact, crime rates in the area are low,
according to USC officials, who count their campus among the 10
safest in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the NFL is living in the past in one respect," said
County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the Coliseum
Commission. "They have some biases against the Coliseum because of
things they associated with the Coliseum years ago. Owners who are on
their ventilators are trying to remember something that happened in
1978 at a Rams' game or in 1994 at a Raiders' game."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Yaroslavsky said, executives from the NFL, which is
based in New York and has headquarters on Park Avenue, are guilty of
"boneheaded" thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Like a lot of things in this country," he said, "people living
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Hudson River think they know
everything."</TE>
<TE>   He also said: "I'm glad the Coliseum is fighting for itself. We
are at the crossroads of the Coliseum--either it becomes a relic to
come look at like they do in Rome ... or a state-of-the-art 21st
century stadium."</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum, as much a part of L.A.'s civic identity as the
Hollywood sign, is the only stadium in the world to stage opening
ceremonies for two Summer Olympics. It played host to the first Super
Bowl and, on a sweltering evening in 1960, was where Sen. John F.
Kennedy accepted the Democratic nomination for president. Evel
Knievel sailed over 50 cars and Mary Decker stumbled and fell to her
knees during the 1984 Summer Games here. When it was the home of the
Dodgers, 93,000 fans illuminated the place with lit matches in a
tribute to Roy Campanella, who had been disabled in a car accident.</TE>
<TE>   "If you believe the NFL, the Coliseum should be stacked up side by
side with the Roman Colosseum to say, 'This is where they used to
play football,' " Yaroslavsky said. "That's not the way we feel."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Coliseum Commission allotted up to $1 million to
pay for legal, architectural and financial advisors who might help in
the process of courting an NFL team. Their work would augment that
done by Ed Roski's group in 1999. Roski, a real-estate magnate, was
part of the coalition looking into building a state-of-the-art
stadium adjacent to Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Wasserman, another key member of that Philip Anschutz-backed
downtown coalition, said this week that none of the people in the
downtown group--which also included Tim Leiweke and Ron Burkle--is
interested in investing in the Coliseum "now, or in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Coliseum General Manager Pat Lynch believes in the funding plan
formulated in 1999 and said he's confident a developer will emerge to
bankroll the project. With expansion, the Coliseum had to please all
team owners. Now, Lynch said, it must only please the one owner who
wants to relocate his team.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum plan builds in the cost of a $400-million stadium but
not a franchise fee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much easier this time," Lynch said. "We can demonstrate now
that the economics are better than they were before. The developer
doesn't have to pay $500 million or more for a franchise fee this
time, plus $400 million for the stadium. The last time, this was a
$1-billion deal. This is less than half of that."</TE>
<TE>   At an NFL owners meeting in Houston last month, Tagliabue was
asked if the Coliseum is a viable option. "No," he said flatly.</TE>
<TE>   Asked this week to clarify that response, Joe Browne, a league
vice president, said it speaks for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who for weeks has expressed strong support for the downtown
stadium plan, referred to it Thursday as "the only game in town." Of
the Coliseum, he said: "I hope we're not spinning our wheels and
wasting our time talking about it."</TE>

<HD>Clemson Beats Nebraska in Ninth, 11-10</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After using six pitchers, the last thing Clemson wanted to see was a
10th inning, but Jeff Baker saved his teammates the trouble.</LD>
<LD>   "It was both excitement and relief," Baker said of his run-scoring
single in the bottom of the ninth that gave Clemson an 11-10 victory
over Nebraska on Friday night in the opening round of the College
World Series at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't want to go extra innings in the first game of a
tournament and put our pitchers in a bind that way."</LD>
<TE>   Baker's first hit was the 21st in a game that had 21 walks.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil Greene hit a three-run homer and drove in five runs, and
Zane Green also hit a three-run homer for the Tigers (53-15).</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska (47-20) is one loss from going 0-2 in the double
elimination tournament for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech 11, South Carolina 0--The only way Kyle Bakker's
homecoming could have gone any better would have been if he finished
the game, but he struck out nine in eight innings and combined on a
six-hitter as the Yellow Jackets (52-14) won the opening game.</TE>
<TE>   Bakker, who went to high school about 20 minutes west of
Rosenblatt Stadium, and Brian Burks combined to pitch the first CWS
shutout since 1995, when Cal State Fullerton's Tim Dixon and Mark
Chavez blanked Tennessee, 11-0.</TE>
<TE>   Wes Rynders had a bases-loaded double and a solo homer to drive in
three runs for the Yellow Jackets. South Carolina (53-17) had not
been shut out since losing to Mississippi State, 1-0, in the
Southeastern Conference tournament last season.</TE>

<HD>Ruiz Returns, Lesson Learned</HD>
<DH>Galaxy: L.A.'s high-scoring rookie is back in lineup today
at New Jersey after serving a one-game suspension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Ruiz is a little bit wiser as he returns to the Galaxy lineup
today for a Major League Soccer game against the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars at Giants Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz, a 22-year old rookie forward from Guatemala, scored a
league-leading 10 goals in the first 10 games of the season. But he
learned a hard lesson when he was forced to sit out the Galaxy's 1-0
victory over the Chicago Fire last Saturday after being suspended and
fined $500 for striking midfielder Wes Hart of Colorado in the
midsection during a June 1 match in Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz was not called for a foul, but replays of the incident
prompted penalties by the league's disciplinary committee.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, the video is very clear," Ruiz said through a
translator. "It was a game situation, but [the league] interpreted it
as an aggression and I think it's obvious what happened.... I
definitely was frustrated and hope this doesn't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz has been a marked man since scoring five goals in the first
three games of the season, but he said opposing defenses haven't
resorted to dirty tactics to slow him down.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the teams have been more aggressive," he said. "But
they have been more aggressive against the whole team, not just me.
They don't want to lose and we don't want to lose so they play hard
to try and stop us."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents are now more inclined to mark Ruiz with an individual
defender after playing a zone against him in the first few games of
the season. But Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said that hasn't deterred
Ruiz's willingness to attack the heart of a defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's extremely hungry to score," Schmid said. "When he sees the
team getting close to the box, he makes those decisive final runs and
he's willing to put himself into places and spaces where some players
don't want to go because there is a chance you might get kicked if
you go in there. He's willing to go in there for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Although Ruiz scored 10 of the Galaxy's first 14 goals, the team
got a boost in his absence when it defeated the Fire to improve to
5-4-2 and snap a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, it was good for us to play a game without him because
[the win] gave the rest of the team confidence," Schmid said. "More
so than anything, we shored up ourselves defensively."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz acknowledges it was difficult to watch last week's game from
the sideline, but his focus is on continuing to play the way he was
before his suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "I recognize in the past that there have been a lot of big-name
players on the Galaxy," he said. "I just want to keep playing well so
people will remember my name."</TE>

<LD>Annika Sorenstam shot a seven-under-par 65 Friday to take a four-shot
lead after three rounds of the LPGA Evian Masters at Evian-Les-Bains,
France.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam has a three-round total of 16-under 200, four shots
ahead of Mi Hyun Kim, who had a 68 for a 12-under 204, and five
strokes better than Cristie Kerr (67), Leta Lindley (70) and Se Ri
Pak (70) at 205.</LD>
<LD>   Vicki Goetz-Ackerman shot a 67 to move into sixth place at 206.
Second-round leader Karin Icher had a 73 and slipped to seventh place
at 207.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Sorenstam predicted she would shoot lower
scores each day. With rounds of 68-67-65 she is making good on her
promise.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on track, right?" Sorenstam said. "The 65 today just makes it
that bit tougher to keep right on tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jay Sigel shot an eight-under-par 64, his best round this year,
and held a two-stroke lead after the opening round of the BellSouth
Senior Classic at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Sigel took advantage of the wide fairways and soft greens at the
Springhouse Golf Club to record six birdies and an eagle in a
bogey-free round.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Quigley and Walter Hall shot 66s, and 71-year-old Miller
Barber bettered his age for the third time in his career with a 67.
He is tied with six others, including Lee Trevino and Fuzzy Zoeller.</TE>
<TE>   Sigel, who tied for 57th last week in the Senior PGA Championship
at Akron, Ohio, used his putter to turn in a round that was four
strokes lower than anything he had shot this year. It was his lowest
round since a 63 at the SBC Senior Open last July.</TE>

<HD>Trainer Goes for Glory</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Mandella tries to end stakes slump in a big
way today, with entries in three graded races at Hollywood Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how long he continues to train thoroughbreds, Richard
Mandella will probably never match the day he had on Nov. 6, 1993.</LD>
<LD>   During the Breeders' Cup program at Santa Anita, Mandella won an
unprecedented four stakes. In addition to two victories on the
undercard with Region in the $150,000 Skywalker Handicap and Memo in
the $100,000 Smile Handicap, the Hall of Fame trainer won the
$2-million Breeders' Cup Turf with Kotashaan, who was later named
horse of the year, and the $1-million Juvenile Fillies with Phone
Chatter.</LD>
<LD>   Such money won't be on the line today at Hollywood Park, but
Mandella has an opportunity to come close to four stakes victories.</LD>
<TE>   Hoping to end a stable stakes drought that has lasted for more
than three months, Mandella has a chance to win all three graded
races Hollywood Park is offering.</TE>
<TE>   The trainer will be represented by Ile de France in the $250,000
Hollywood Breeders' Cup Oaks, Cagney in the $350,000 Charlie
Whittingham Memorial Handicap and Investor's Dream and Redattore in
the $500,000 Californian.</TE>
<TE>   A win by any of the four horses would be welcome. The last stakes
victories for a barn that has been one of the best in the country
came during the first weekend of April. Kudos, Crazy Ensign and
Alexine won at Oaklawn Park, Bay Meadows and Santa Anita,
respectively, in a span of two days.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, there have been seven runner-up finishes, some
extremely narrow losses. Two of the seconds were provided by
Redattore, who finished behind longshot Night Patrol in the Inglewood
Handicap three weeks before he chased favored Ladies Din in the
Shoemaker Breeders' Cup Mile.</TE>
<TE>   A 7-year-old, Brazilian-bred son of Roi Normand owned by Luis
Alfredo Taunay, Redattore is switching to the main track for the
Californian, which is the final prep for the $750,000 Hollywood Gold
Cup on July 14.</TE>
<TE>   While he has won seven of 15 on grass, Redattore has also won two
of his three starts on dirt. In his last main track appearance, he
won the San Antonio Handicap at Santa Anita, beating Euchre by half a
length on Feb. 3.</TE>
<TE>   "Redattore's tough no matter where he runs," Mandella said Friday.
"He's good on both turf and dirt, so he should be tough to deal with
[today]."</TE>
<TE>   Like his stablemate, Investor's Dream was bred and began his
career in Brazil. Owned by Stud TNT, which also has Cagney and Ile de
France, the 4-year-old Spend A Buck colt was impressive winning on
the grass in his first start in this country. He'll be trying the
dirt for only the second time. He was a runner-up in South America in
his lone start on the main, but his local works suggest he could be a
factor in the Grade II.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always trained better on the dirt than he has on the turf,"
Mandella said.</TE>
<TE>   The horse to beat in the 1 1/8-mile Californian is Milwaukee Brew.
Owned by Frank Stronach and trained by Bobby Frankel, the 5-year-old
son of Wild Again will be making his first appearance since winning
the Santa Anita Handicap by four lengths on March 2.</TE>
<TE>   In the Whittingham, which is at 1 1/4 miles on turf, Frankel again
has the horse to beat in Skipping, who shortens an eighth of a mile
after winning the Jim Murray Memorial Handicap on May 19.</TE>
<TE>   Cagney is adding blinkers for Mandella in his first race since he
was fourth as the 7-5 favorite in the San Juan Capistrano on April 21
at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Ile De France, a gray daughter of Storm Cat, will break from the
rail in the 1 1/16-mile Oaks, which is the first of the day's stakes
races. She was third, beaten by two lengths by You at 55-1 in the
Santa Anita Oaks, then finished 17 1/2 lengths behind winner Farda
Amiga in the Kentucky Oaks on May 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The California Horse Racing Board has scheduled its special
meeting to consider the future of racing at Fairplex Park for June 26
at the Los Angeles International Airport Crowne Plaza Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Fair officials are seeking to move the 17-day
meet to Santa Anita Park. The seven-member board nearly voted to
reject the proposed move at its June 6 meeting, but a 3-3 tie was not
broken because member Marie Moretti abstained.</TE>

<LD>The $500,000 Californian at Hollywood Park isn't the only race for
older handicap horses.</LD>
<LD>   Congaree, arguably one of the three best older horses in the
country along with Mizzen Mast and Macho Uno, will take on Dubai
World Cup winner Street Cry in the $750,000 Stephen Foster Handicap
at Churchill Downs, one of four stakes at the Louisville track. The
others are the $100,000 Northern Dancer, the $150,000 Regret and the
$300,000 Fleur De Lis.</LD>
<LD>   Godolphin Racing Inc., which owns Street Cry, will also try to win
the $250,000 Brooklyn Handicap at Belmont Park with E Dubai.</LD>
<TE>   A $1.35-million yearling purchase, E Dubai will be making his
first start since finishing second in the Super Derby Sept. 23 at
Louisiana Downs. He has won two of three at Belmont Park and will be
ridden for the first time by Jose Santos.</TE>
<TE>   About 90 minutes after the Brooklyn is official, local players
will turn their attention to the pick six at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   The exotic wager, which kicks off in the fifth race and includes
the Charlie Whittingham Memorial Handicap and the Californian, has a
$1-million guaranteed pool today.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Jockey David Flores will be in Texas to ride
Suances for trainer Darrell Vienna in the $250,000 Dallas Turf Cup at
Lone Star Park. The 1 1/8-mile race is the first leg of a national
pick three, which also includes the Hollywood Breeders' Cup Oaks and
the Stephen Foster Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Timely Action. The 3-year-old son of Gilded Time is
unbeaten in two starts this year for trainer Richard Mandella and
stakes races are definitely in his future. A possibility is the
seven-furlong King's Bishop, a Grade I, in August at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Trainers John Anderson, Deanna Cook and James Kiesner.
They are a combined 0 for 51 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Bear Fan in the fourth,
using Disguys Dalimit, B.T. Gotrich and Immense Variety in the fifth
and Skipping and Startac in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 3/98. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $22/$565. Total money bet: $636.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Sends the Mets a Message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robin Ventura delivered the biggest blow to the New York
Mets--beating his former team with an extra-inning home run.</LD>
<LD>   On a night the New York Yankees delivered more punishment to their
intracity rivals with both batted and thrown balls, Ventura's two-run
homer in the 10th inning capped a late rally and dealt the Mets a
tough 4-2 loss Friday night at Shea Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   After Derek Jeter tied it in the ninth with a two-out single off
closer Armando Benitez, the Yankees won the opener of the highly
anticipated Subway Series in the 10th.</LD>
<TE>   Jorge Posada led off with a line drive off Satoru Komiyama (0-3)
that eluded center fielder Timo Perez for a double. That brought up
Ventura, traded to the Yankees in December as the Mets tried to add
more power to their lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets have lost nine of 13 to fall seven games behind Atlanta
in the National League East.</TE>
<TE>   This 4-hour 36-minute game was a warmup for today's anticipated
main event when Roger Clemens comes to Shea to hit and pitch for the
first time since beaning Mike Piazza and throwing a shattered bat in
his direction two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets took a 2-0 lead after four innings against Andy Pettitte
before Sterling Hitchcock brought a little excitement to the game in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   With two out and a man on first, Hitchcock hit Jeromy Burnitz in
the top of the helmet with a 1-2 pitch. The ball bounced out toward
the pitcher's mound.</TE>
<TE>   Burnitz yelled at Hitchcock as he walked to first base and home
plate umpire Mark Carlson warned both teams. Carlson talked to Met
starter Steve Trachsel before the start of the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cubs 8, Chicago White Sox 4--Nothing like a visit from
their crosstown rivals to get the Cubs going.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 25th home run, and Todd
Hundley homered twice. The homer was No. 475 for Sosa, tying him with
Stan Musial and Willie Stargell for 19th on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Florida 3--Luis Castillo extended his hitting streak
to 29 games, but the Devil Rays had the key hit in the 14th inning at
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Grieve's run-scoring double broke a tie in the 14th, and the
Devil Rays won. Rain halted play for 66 minutes going into the bottom
of the 14th.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Kansas City 0--Matt Morris (9-4) pitched eight
innings of two-hit ball to lead the Cardinals at St. Louis. He
yielded singles in the first and second innings, and then retired 12
consecutive batters before issuing a fifth-inning walk to Brent
Mayne.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 7, Minnesota 5--Pinch-hitter Ronnie Belliard's two-run
single off Mike Jackson (2-2) in the bottom of the eight inning ended
the Brewers' seven-game losing streak. Tyler Houston and Jose
Hernandez hit successive singles. After they were sacrificed over by
Robert Machado, Belliard singled down the left-field line past diving
third baseman Corey Koskie to score both runs.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 8, Toronto 2--First baseman Lee Stevens, hitting only
.188 before the game at Montreal, homered and had a season-high four
runs batted in. He walked with the bases loaded in the first inning
before hitting a two-run homer in the third. In the fifth, he hit a
run-scoring triple.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 9, Houston 6--Michael Young went five for five with two
homers and the Rangers put together a four-run sixth inning to beat
Astros at Houston. Young has hits in his last seven at-bats. He hit
solo homers in the second and the ninth and scored the go-ahead run
in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 6, San Diego 3--Freddy Garcia (9-4) won his fifth
consecutive start and the Mariners roughed up former teammate Brett
Tomko at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko (3-5), traded from the Mariners to the Padres in a
six-player deal on Dec. 11, gave up eight hits, five runs and four
walks in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Colorado 3--The Indians opened a 12-game road trip,
their longest of the season, by winning for only the third time in
nine games. It was their eighth win in their last 25 road games.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 6, Arizona 3--In his second major league start, Mike
Maroth outpitched Curt Schilling at Bank One Ballpark. He gave up
five hits in eight innings, spoiling Schilling's bid for a major
league-best 13th victory.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 3, San Francisco 2--Tim Hudson (4-6) ended the longest
losing streak of his career with seven innings of seven-hit ball at
Pacific Bell Park as the Athletics won their eighth in a row. It was
his first victory since April 28.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 7, Philadelphia 3--Jeff Conine tripled in two runs to
break a tie in the eighth inning at Philadelphia. The Phillies fell a
season-worst 10 games behind Atlanta in the NL East.</TE>
<TE>   NATIONAL LEAGUE</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 4, Pittsburgh 3--Aaron Boone hit a tying solo homer off
Mike Williams in the bottom of the ninth and another off the closer
in the 11th. The Reds hit solo homers in the seventh, eighth, ninth
and 11th innings to hang onto sole possession of first place in the
NL Central.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that the World Cup has spent the last two weeks discovering
Japan, is the World Cup ready for Japan in the quarterfinals?</LD>
<LD>   Philippe Troussier, the Frenchman who coaches the Japanese team,
was talking about a trip to the final eight Friday after watching his
squad defeat Tunisia, 2-0, in Osaka to clinch first place in Group H.</LD>
<LD>   "To qualify for the second round was our main aim but we don't
think this is the end of things," Troussier said.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not tired, we have more to give, we are fresh and on home
turf. We are calm, we are on our way, we want to achieve good
things."</TE>
<TE>   And, what he didn't say: Japan has a second-round match against
Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Beat Turkey on Monday in Miyagi--Japan will be favored--and the
co-hosts, having never won a World Cup match before 2002, will be in
the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "Against Turkey," Troussier said, "I think that with our 12th man,
the home crowd, we can hope for many more things."</TE>
<TE>   Japan has had a charmed path from the outset, being seeded into
the flimsiest group in the competition, matched against Belgium,
Russia and Tunisia--and needing only to out-point two of them to
reach the second round. Japan obliged, going undefeated in the group
at 2-0-1, wrapping up first place with a victory over 0-2-1 Tunisia.</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first half, Hiroaki Morishima gave Japan the
goal it needed by pouncing on a loose ball in the Tunisian penalty
area and delivering past goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel from 10 yards.
Hidetoshi Nakata made it 2-0 in the 75th minute by heading in a cross
from Daisuke Ichikawa.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we feel very rewarded for our efforts," Troussier said.</TE>

<LD>Something's rotten in FIFA.</LD>
<LD>   South Korea is at risk of being the first host nation in World Cup
history to miss the round of 16. National pride is on the line.
Everything hinges on the results of two simultaneous games--the U.S.
against Poland and South Korea against Portugal. Indeed, the distinct
possibility of the U.S. advancing in place of Korea would pour salt
into an Asian wound that has festered for three years since the U.S.
women defeated China for the Women's World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   So FIFA gives the U.S. a Chinese referee?</LD>
<TE>   Surprise of surprises: The referee disallows a U.S. goal based on
a phantom Landon Donovan foul, awards Poland a penalty kick on a
legitimate tackle, ignores at least two actual Polish fouls that
would have resulted in penalty kicks and allows an illegal Polish
goal to stand despite an obvious offside.</TE>
<TE>   If that's not enough to validate the conspiracy theory, how about
the two red cards delivered to Portuguese players against Korea?</TE>
<TE>   Having already weathered one scandal, Sepp Blatter may think his
tainted FIFA presidency immune to another. Fortunately, this time
there's tape to back it up.</TE>

<LD>Amid all the speculation over possible retaliation [today] when the
Yankees meet the Mets without the DH rule in effect, and Roger
Clemens, who callously beaned Mike Piazza, is forced to make a plate
appearance, let me suggest the ideal scenario.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens steps up to the plate. Met starter Shawn Estes plunks him
in the ribs with a fastball. Clemens slowly jogs off to first base.
There is no charging the mound, no glaring, no histrionics of any
kind. The baseball gods have been appeased and all is well.</LD>

<TE>   Except for allowing games to be played on artificial surfaces, the
dumbest thing Major League Baseball has done over the past 50 years
has been restoring the unbalanced schedule. The dopes who implemented
that scheme should be forced to attend every one of the 19 games
between Tampa Bay and Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when the game itself is in jeopardy due to such issues
as formulating a new labor agreement and steroid/drug abuses, there
is a need for leaders with vision to expand the opportunities for
fans throughout the U.S. to see the widest variety of competition.
This could be done by scheduling 36 interleague games each season and
going back to the practice of two visits by each interdivision club.</TE>
<TE>   With a mind-set bent on contraction, I hold little hope that the
MLB establishment would provide any consideration for such a
proposal.</TE>

<LD>After watching the sad loss of a sluggish Mike Tyson to Lennox Lewis,
my fears were confirmed. The death of Cus d'Amato left Iron Mike
devoid of inspiration. I have all along argued that there is no one
alive who can put the iron back into Mike.</LD>
<LD>   I am glad it's all over now and I hope Lewis rejects Tyson's
request for a rematch. It would only lead to D'Amato groaning in his
grave and another embarrassing defeat.</LD>

<LD>Lisa Dillman's article in the June 10 Times was interesting in that
it shows a maturity on the part of the Williams sisters in dealing
with the media.</LD>
<LD>   That is nice to hear.</LD>
<LD>   What no writer has addressed is the caliber of the final match of
the French Open. If the No. 1 player in the world makes only one
forehand winner and no backhand winners in 21 games of a match and
the No. 1 and No. 2 players share 105 unforced errors, it seems to me
the tennis-loving public was cheated.</LD>
<TE>   If playing each other in a match makes these tennis players so
nervous they can't perform to a level that vaguely resembles their
ability, maybe they shouldn't enter the same tournaments.</TE>

<LD>Making her third start for owners James Azevedo and Charles Boyles
and trainer Paul Jones, Shell Ha was dominant going 220 yards on May
23.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old Holland Ease filly won by 1 1/2 lengths as the 3-5
favorite, breaking on the lead from the outside post under jockey
Ramon Sanchez.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, Shell Ha will try to stretch her speed an additional 130
yards in the $13,000 Corona Cash Handicap.</LD>
<TE>   If Shell Ha is going to earn her second win, she'll have to outrun
Coup Of Corona and three others in the Corona Cash, which is the
ninth of 11 races on the card.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Corina and Celina Molina and trained by Jaime Gomez, Coup
Of Corona was upset as the 1-2 favorite in her last outing, a trial
for the Kindergarten Futurity on May 4. The daughter of Corona Cartel
was beaten by a neck by Red Lipstick.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Full Court. 2. Don't Forget. 3. White Rule. 4.
Magellan FRSB. 5. Babe With Rhythm. 6. Kid Flyer. 7. Jolinos Dasher.
8. Cha Ching Chic. 9. Coup Of Corona. 10. Rail Skimmer. 11. Mirthy.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Full Court, Kid Charismatic and Dash Diamond in the
first, Fat Tuesday, Zipolator and Don't Forget in the second, single
White Rule (third) and Magellan FRSB, Mucho Caliente and Kador De
Blaziet (fourth).</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: A Chicks Beduino could improve in his second
time out in the sixth for trainer Connie Hall. Keno Cartel has the
outside post in the eighth after being bumped around at the break in
his most recent for trainer R. C. Howell.</TE>

<HD>Jockey McCarron to Call It Quits</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Hall of Fame rider, winner of more than 7,000
races, will announce retirement today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jockey Chris McCarron, winner of more than 7,000 races and already a
member of horse racing's Hall of Fame, will announce his retirement
during a news conference at Hollywood Park today. His last mount will
be June 23.</LD>
<LD>   A winner of six Triple Crown races and five Breeders' Cup
Classics, McCarron, 47, said he has "grown tired of the grind of
going to the track early in the mornings and a little tired of the
pressure. I don't have the same fire and desire.</LD>
<LD>   "I just know it's time," he said.</LD>
<TE>   McCarron will fulfill a commitment to compete in the National
Thoroughbred Racing Assn.'s All-Star Jockey Challenge on Friday at
Lone Star Park, then will ride for the final time a week from Sunday
at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   When he first pondered retirement about a month ago, McCarron
thought he might retire after the Breeders' Cup, Oct. 26 at Arlington
Park.</TE>
<TE>   But after talking with his wife, Judy, who had noticed his
unhappiness, McCarron decided now was the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely convinced I've made the right decision," said the
rider, who is the father of three girls--Erin, Stephanie and Kristin.
"I'm very happy with the response of my entire family.</TE>
<TE>   "I discussed it with my brother Gregg [a former jockey who retired
in 1993] and I got some good advice from him. We pretty much
concluded it was time. He didn't talk me into it, but he just told me
I had to make up my own mind. Allan, my brother who lives in Del Mar,
is the only one who tried to talk me out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Saying he spent most of Friday on the phone, McCarron called
fellow Hall of Famers Laffit Pincay, Jr., Eddie Delahoussaye and Bill
Shoemaker with the news and also talked to jockey Alex Solis, another
client of McCarron's agent, Scott McClellan.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all pretty surprised, but they were also very
supportive," he said. "I went to Scott's house on Wednesday night to
watch the Laker game and at halftime I told him I wanted to talk to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he took it very well. He gave me a good, sincere
handshake and said, 'It's been a hell of a ride and we've done a lot
to be proud of.' "</TE>
<TE>   McClellan, who has worked with McCarron for some 20 years, wished
his friend the best but said the message was difficult to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a super guy and I want to stay good friends with him for the
rest of my life," McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron is among only seven jockeys to win 7,000 races, and a
couple of his most notable contributions to racing have come away
from the track. Besides helping to establish the Don MacBeth Memorial
Jockey Fund some 15 years ago to help disabled riders, McCarron has
long been active with the Jockeys' Guild.</TE>
<TE>   "Between riding and my involvement with the Guild, there was no
time left for my family," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After taking some time off to relax and "clear my head," McCarron
said he intends to make the Guild top priority, saying there are many
serious challenges ahead for riders and the sport in general.</TE>
<TE>   He said he wants to stay involved in racing in some additional
capacity and didn't rule out becoming a trainer. Shoemaker and John
Longden are examples of Hall of Fame riders who became successful
trainers after retiring from the saddle. Longden won two-thirds of a
Triple Crown with Majestic Prince in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron began Friday with 7,136 wins, sixth on the all-time list,
and as the sport's career earnings leader.</TE>
<TE>   His mounts have won more than $264 million.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Dorchester, Mass., McCarron finished last on Most Active,
his first mount, on Jan. 24, 1974, at Bowie Race Track in Maryland.
He earned his first winner 16 days later and quickly became the
dominant jockey on the circuit.</TE>
<TE>   He won a record 546 races that first year, a mark that stood until
Kent Desormeaux won 598 in 1989. He was honored with an Eclipse Award
as the nation's top apprentice and went on to win eight riding titles
at Laurel and Pimlico from 1974-77.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to California in 1978, he did not take long to
establish himself. He was the leading jockey at Oak Tree in 1979, the
first of his 25 riding titles at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del
Mar.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron earned a second Eclipse Award in 1980 when he was the
nation's leading rider. Along with Desormeaux and Steve Cauthen, he
is the only jockey to win the award as an apprentice and a
journeyman.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth in the nation in purse earnings with $12,933,932 last year
and tops among local riders with 40 stakes winners in Southern
California, McCarron started this week ranked 12th this year with
$4,123,498.</TE>
<TE>   Besides five Breeders' Cup Classic victories with Tiznow (twice),
Alysheba, Sunday Silence and Alphabet Soup, who shocked Cigar at
Woodbine in 1996, he won four other Breeders' Cup races, an Arlington
Million in 1984 with John Henry, and dozens of other important races
with such thoroughbred stars as Precisionist, Paseana, Flawlessly,
Riboletta, Lady's Secret, Free House, Forty Niner, Glorious Song,
Best Pal, Bertrando, Flying Paster and Bayakoa.</TE>
<TE>   His final win in a Triple Crown race was a historic one with Touch
Gold in the 1997 Belmont Stakes. After encountering all kinds of
trouble three weeks earlier in the Preakness, Touch Gold ran past
Silver Charm in the final yards, thwarting the gray in his bid to
become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Injured seriously in spills at Santa Anita in 1986 and Hollywood
Park in 1990, McCarron said his induction into the Hall of Fame in
his first year of eligibility remains his most memorable moment.
"It's the biggest feather in my cap," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rider provided trainer Jay Robbins with his biggest moments
the last two Breeders' Cups with unforgettable victories aboard the
now-retired Tiznow. The California-bred edged Giant's Causeway in
2000 at Churchill Downs, then won another thriller last fall at
Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron is scheduled to be aboard first-time starter Catabatic
Wind for Robbins on Sunday at Hollywood Park, and the trainer was
surprised to hear about the rider's retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of in shock," Robbins said. "He works horses for me
periodically and he hadn't given any indication he was thinking about
retirement. He's a great asset to the industry and he's always been
involved in a lot of different aspects.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a terrific rider. He was very diligent about his job and he
could tell you about a horse after getting on them in the morning or
in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times we would talk about the state of the industry and
the problems it faces and he just might think he can better serve it
in a different way."</TE>

<LD>Troy Percival usually delivers his messages via an intimidating
fastball and knee-buckling curve.</LD>
<LD>   About two weeks ago, however, the Angel closer delivered a message
of another kind.</LD>
<LD>   Percival phoned a friend who works for the Dodgers and asked him
to congratulate Eric Gagne on his success and tell him he hoped he
could keep it going.</LD>
<TE>   "I think he must know what I had been through the last couple
years and how I had been struggling," Gagne said. "I was really
pleased to get his message. It was an awesome, really professional
thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only in my first year at this and still have a lot to prove
and a lot to learn. Guys like Percival, [Robb] Nen and [Mariano]
Rivera are my role models. They're the closers I look up to if I'm
going to become the real deal at this."</TE>
<TE>   If there is something of a mutual admiration society in the
high-wire world of closers, the Freeway Chapter convened in the
bullpens at Dodger Stadium on Friday night with evidence that Gagne,
leading the major leagues in saves, is already at Percival's
real-deal level.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence also suggests that if the Dodgers and Angels are going to
continue on their promising and parallel courses, Gagne and Percival
are pivotal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's evident that any championship-caliber club needs the
one guy or a combination of people who can come in and consistently
nail down wins in the ninth inning," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "It's also evident that these are two of the best."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, said the respected Harry Minor, a longtime New York
Met scout, Gagne and Percival have probably "moved into a class by
themselves" when it comes to consistently blowing hitters away with
fastballs of 95 mph or more--fastballs that make it impossible for a
hitter to look for Percival's 70- to 75-mph curve ("he's absolutely
wicked when he's throwing the curve for strikes," Minor said) or
Gagne's tantalizing changeup, which is complemented by a slider and
curve.</TE>
<TE>   Nen, Billy Wagner, John Smoltz, Armando Benitez and Billy Koch are
closers who can light up a speed gun at 95 mph plus.</TE>
<TE>   But the consensus of scouts seems to be that none sustain it like
Percival and Gagne, and none can vary speeds so dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Percival has been doing it for eight years in the major leagues
and four in the minors. The Angels only needed to see part of his
rookie season at Boise, Idaho, in 1990 to decide that if the
live-arm, dead-bat catcher had a baseball future, it was on the
mound.</TE>
<TE>   If he hadn't made the transition, "I'd probably be a backup
catcher at double A or stocking shelves at Home Depot," Percival
said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, at 32, he entered the weekend with 225 career saves. He
had 39 last year and is 15 for 16 in save opportunities this year,
having sat out the first three weeks because of a strained back
muscle. He had 28 strikeouts in 20 2/3 innings through Thursday, and
by restricting batters to a .181 average entering the season, he
ranked first among major league pitchers with 200 or more innings.</TE>
<TE>   It is no wonder that during the off-season, attracted by
Percival's resume when they had no clear-cut successor to Jeff Shaw,
the Dodgers reportedly offered Matt Herges, Marquis Grissom and
Chin-Feng Chen for Percival.</TE>
<TE>   The timing seemed right, because it appeared unlikely the Angels
could re-sign Percival given his anger at club
management--specifically then-president Tony Tavares--for leaking
salary information.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger sources say top Angel management rejected the offer. Angel
sources say the offer was never made.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't matter now where the truth rests.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares resigned, a happy Percival gave up free agency next winter
to sign a two-year, $16-million extension, and the Dodgers, operating
off what they had seen in the spring, traded Herges to Montreal,
clearing the way for Gagne to become the closer.</TE>
<TE>   "No one would ever have believed he could do what he's done," said
Minor, the Mets' scout. "That's not to say we haven't all liked his
arm for quite a while.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple years ago my club got interested and had me fly into
Colorado Springs [when Gagne was pitching in the Pacific Coast
League] to take a look at him.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept throwing his name out [in trade talks], but we couldn't
put it together. The Dodgers wanted a lot for him, and justifiably
so.</TE>
<TE>   "They might not have known just how good he was going to be then,
or how they would eventually use him, but we all know how good he is
now."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne has converted 22 of 23 save opportunities, burying concern
about his control. Before Friday, he had walked only four and struck
out 46 in 33 1/3 innings, fashioning a 1.35 earned-run average and
restricting batters to a major league-best .147 average.</TE>
<TE>   "He relies on his heater to set up everything," said Minor, and
the thing about that, the most eye-popping part of his adjustment to
the closer role, is that his velocity has increased about two or
three miles per hour, consistently registering in the 97-98 mph
range.</TE>
<TE>   That increase has generated speculation about steroid use, which
Gagne has strongly denied, insisting he simply got bigger and
stronger through a more rigorous training regimen in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, said Scioscia, it is not unusual for a starting
pitcher who is moved into a situation where he knows he only has to
throw his best stuff over a short span to display a sudden increase
in velocity.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a consistent pattern of that," said Scioscia, who never
managed Gagne in the Dodger farm system but knew "he had a tremendous
arm and potential and you have to be impressed the way he's overcome
some setbacks [including reconstructive elbow surgery in 1997] to
take advantage of this opportunity and become one of the premier
closers."</TE>
<TE>   Percival agreed, which is why he sent that congratulatory message
to Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not into professional jealousy," Percival said. "I don't have
to prove anything or impress anyone. I know what I've done and what I
can do. I also know how difficult it is, what it feels like to go out
and blow a save, so I don't root for anybody to blow a save unless
they're in our division or pitching against us.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy watching other closers, and while I only know about Gagne
from what I've read and seen on TV, you have to be impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a common thing and it's not an easy thing to step into
that role at this level without any experience at it, but he's got
great stuff from what I've seen.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can throw 95 plus with his competitiveness and off-speed
pitches, I'm surprised he hadn't been tried in that role before."</TE>

<HD>Navratilova Will Go It Alone in Eastbourne Tournament</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martina Navratilova, who retired in 1994 after winning a record 167
singles titles, received a wild card Friday to play in next week's
Eastbourne tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very excited," she said. "It should be a whole lot of fun."</LD>
<LD>   Navratilova was already in England practicing for the doubles draw
with partner Natasha Zvereva when she learned of her singles berth.
The grass-court event starts Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really going to be something else," she said, adding it's
been a year since she played even noncompetitive singles.</TE>
<TE>   Because she no longer has a singles ranking, Navratilova had to be
granted a wild card into the main draw.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova, 45, returned to play doubles on the Sanex WTA Tour in
2000, and played doubles in 12 events last year.</TE>
<TE>   Her best showing was a title in the Madrid Open last month with
Zvereva, making Navratilova the oldest player to win a tour title.
But Navratilova hasn't played a tour singles event since retiring in
November 1994.</TE>
<TE>   She decided to play singles again after losing an unspecified bet
with her personal trainer. The loser had to do whatever the winner
wished for, and her trainer's wish was for Navratilova to play
singles again, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be hedging my bets in the future," she said.</TE>

<HD>He's Still Pouring It On</HD>
<DH>Golf: After Woods shoots a second-round 68 in rain,
conditions get worse and Harrington is the only player close. Garcia
is unhappy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>In a tournament that started out on ESPN but might end up on the
Weather Channel, Tiger Woods on Friday took one giant puddle-jump
toward adding another title to his impressive resume, otherwise known
here as the United States National Downpour.</LD>
<LD>   Proving even a kid from dehydrated Southern California can adjust
his game and his slickers at a moment's notice, Woods fired a
rain-drenched two-under-par 68 at Bethpage Black to extend his
36-hole lead to three shots at the 102nd U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   Woods' score of 67-68 for a total of 135 through two rounds leaves
him at five under par overall and the leader in a very soggy
clubhouse.</LD>
<TE>   With a lucky-charmed afternoon round of 68, Padraig Harrington of
Ireland stands at 138 after 36 holes, two under overall and three
shots back of Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, Harrington, Japan's Shigeki Maruyama, who shot a 67, and
John Maginnes (69) were the only players who broke par Friday.
Harrington is the only other player under par overall and the
next-closest players are seven shots behind Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Game over?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody's going to catch him," Jay Haas said of
Woods. "I think he's gone for good."</TE>
<TE>   At least Harrington's belated charge left some doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, consider that Woods has held the second-round lead at four
previous majors--the 1997 Masters, 2000 U.S. Open, 2000 British Open,
2000 PGA Championship--and went on to win all four.</TE>
<TE>   It was another creative and determined day for Woods, who staved
off a string of potential bogeys to seize command of the day.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a fortunate day for Woods, who played under a steady
drizzle in the morning but completed his round before the sky really
unloaded in the afternoon just as his primary contenders--Sergio
Garcia, Phil Mickelson, Harrington and K.J. Choi--were teeing up
balls and battening down hatches.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, whose opening-round 68 left him only a shot behind Woods,
did a lot of back-puddling Friday, losing his edge and, at times, his
temper during his round of four-over 74. Garcia now trails Woods by
seven shots.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, whose nickname is El Nino, insisted afterward that play
should have been halted during the downpour and suggested there was a
conspiracy--another Water-gate?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know, if Tiger Woods had been out there, I think it would
have been called," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Harrington somehow managed a 68 playing in the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was jumpy all day. At the par-four 16th hole early in his
round--he started at No. 10--Garcia backed off a fairway shot and
made a hand gesture to a fan who had shouted something from the
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they make some stupid comments," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   There's an adage it's better to be lucky than good, yet Garcia is
right about this: Woods is lucky and good.</TE>
<TE>   Woods caught a weather break at the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Remember that?</TE>
<TE>   Woods, under sunny skies, fired an opening-round 65 in the morning
before a fog descended on the course, causing play to be suspended
with 75 players on course.</TE>
<TE>   If you're looking for omens, Woods won that Open by 15 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I've still got to play 36 more holes," Woods cautioned Friday,
trying to comfort NBC's corporate sponsors. "It's not like we're
having the awards presentation today."</TE>
<TE>   Woods has been playing on another plane for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, he was on another hydro-plane.</TE>
<TE>   He opened and closed Friday's round with bookend birdies and
scrambled enough in between to keep his clubs above water.</TE>
<TE>   Woods actually started with birdies on No. 1 and No. 2, recovering
on the opening hole after he sprayed his tee shot into the right
rough.</TE>
<TE>   He surged as low as six under after he made birdie on the par-five
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   He gave back shots with a bogey on No. 8 and one on No. 10 but
even his miscues are smart.</TE>
<TE>   After knocking his second shot in a bunker on No. 8, a 210-yard
par three, Woods decided against going for the glory shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I buried it in the left bunker and had no shot at making par,"
Woods said. "I said, 'I'm just going to grind it out so I don't make
double. Go ahead and make your bogey, and let's get out of here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Woods, trying to become the first player since Jack Nicklaus in
1972 to win the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year, finished with
four birdies and two bogeys, but he was most proud of his 12 pars.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 15, a tough par four, Woods got up-and-down from a bunker.</TE>
<TE>   But his best save of the day came at the par-three 17th after his
tee shot landed in the thick rough.</TE>
<TE>   Not even Houdini escapes this, right?</TE>
<TE>   Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Woods gently flipped his club blade through the wet grass and the
ball rose up and landed gently on the green, where it nearly rolled
into the cup for a birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "It came out absolutely perfect," he said of his chip.</TE>
<TE>   Another par save.</TE>
<TE>   "Those par putts are the key," he said. "You're going to have to
make them. No matter what you do, you're going to have to somehow
make those par putts to stay in the tournament."</TE>
<TE>   After the save on 17, Woods took a ferry over to No. 18, a par
four, and rolled in an 18-footer to end his day with a birdie.</TE>
<TE>   You wonder how Woods, a kid who grew up in Southern California,
could look so Gene Kelly comfortable in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, nary an angle of Woods' golf education was neglected.</TE>
<TE>   On the few occasions it did rain in Southern California, Woods
grabbed his clubs and headed for a course.</TE>
<TE>   "The only hard part was trying to convince my mom that I could go
out and play without catching a cold," Woods said. "That was not
easy."</TE>
<TE>   This U.S. Open has not been booked and recorded, yet catching
Woods over the final 36 holes might be a bigger longshot than Sarava
at Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be difficult, there's no doubt about it," Woods
said. "In any U.S. Open, it's always going to be difficult to make up
shots because it's not easy to make birdies."</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Woods wondered how much more rain the course could take.</TE>
<TE>   The better question is how much more of Tiger Woods the U.S. Open
field can handle.</TE>
<TE>   The educated guess was leaning toward "not much."</TE>

<HD>Even at 10 Over, Cut Has a Major Bite</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Friday's cut at the U.S. Open ended up at a whopping 10 over par, and
still some of the game's greatest names weren't spared from
elimination.</LD>
<LD>   Among those who won't play this weekend are former major
tournament winners David Duval (11 over), Mark Calcavecchia (11
over), Hale Irwin (23 over) Paul Azinger (17 over), Tom Kite (13
over), Lee Janzen (13 over), Mark Brooks, (13 over) and Retief Goosen
(14 over).</LD>
<LD>   It was Goosen who defeated Brooks in a playoff to win last year's
U.S. Open at Southern Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart Cink, who could have joined that playoff had he not
three-putted the 72nd hole, also missed this year's cut, finishing 12
over.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's cut is the highest total since the 10-over cut at the
1972 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Open record for highest cut number is 15 over at Olympic
Club in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Other notables not making this year's cut were Jim Furyk, who some
pegged as a contender here, Craig Perks, winner of this year's
Players Championship, and Colin Montgomerie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After two memorable but high-scoring days at the U.S. Open,
16-year-old Derek Tolan returns home to Colorado to further his
education in high school and in golf.</TE>
<TE>   Tolan shot an 18-over 88 Friday and leaves Bethpage with a
two-round score of 166, 26 over par.</TE>
<TE>   "It beat me up," he said. "Making the turn today, it was like,
'This course is killing me.'</TE>
<TE>   "I showed by my play that physically and mentally I am not ready
to play at this level. It's been a great learning experience. Now I
have some confidence that I can accomplish a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Tolan's trip was not a total loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get any autographs, but I met a lot of awesome people,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   More than that, Tolan is looking forward to driving a new set of
wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Tolan's father, John, promised his son a car if he qualified for
the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   And what if his dad goes back on the promise?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll run away," Tolan joked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods can't get over how loud the galleries have been at
Bethpage.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't have a hearing problem, I might have one by the end of
the week," he joked. "You come off these tee boxes and they scream
right in your ear. And eventually you just--you don't hear it
anymore, because it's so loud."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Using an eight-iron, Shigeki Maruyama scored a hole in one Friday
on the 161-yard 14th. It was the 35th known hole in one in U.S. Open
history.</TE>
<TE>   It was not such a good day for countryman Toshi Izawa, who
withdrew before Friday's second round because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   The cynic would suggest Izawa got sick after firing an 80 in
Thursday's first round. Izawa was making his second U.S. Open
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   True confessions from pro golfers on a dark, dreary and rain-swept
second day at the U.S. Open:</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lonard after shooting 74: "I played horrendous on the back."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Herron after shooting 75: "We've never seen a course like
this."</TE>
<TE>   Scott McCarron after shooting 72: "It's one of the toughest rounds
I've ever played."</TE>
<TE>   Woody Austin after going 79-76: "If you're playing well, you can
lay it. I just played like a dog."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Twain said everyone talks about the weather but no one does
anything about it, but here's the weekend U.S. Open forecast:</TE>
<TE>   The rain is supposed to taper off this morning, with the afternoon
possibly producing some sunshine with a high temperature of 66.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday calls for some sunshine with scattered showers and the
possibility of late-day thunderstorms.</TE>

Results</HD>

<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Scenes from a World Cup gone mad, mad, mad, mad, mad:</LD>
<LD>   In Daejeon, South Korea, the United States is playing miserably.
The defending is sinful. The finishing is wasteful. The Polish are
leading, 3-1, and when the final whistle sounds, American players can
be seen smiling, hugging, celebrating, because events on another
field far away have conspired to send the United States to the second
round.</LD>
<LD>   In the parlance of the sport, this is known as getting the result.</LD>
<TE>   In Oita, Japan, Mexican players are playing keepaway with the
ball, pinging it slowly back and forth, while their Italian opponents
just stand there, some shuffling their feet, some fixing their hair,
most doing less than that, just idly watching the ball roll around on
the grass for two, three, four full minutes before even the referee
has seen enough and brings the match to a close.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico and Italy are through to the second round. Once again,
class: They got the result.</TE>
<TE>   In Yokohama, a rainbow coalition of sportswriters is monitoring
the U.S.-Poland and Portugal-South Korea games on television screens
inside the international media center. A few writers from Europe, one
from South America, two from Africa and a couple Yanks who cannot
believe their immediate travel plans hinge on the number of red cards
the referee doles out to Portugal and the number of goals Jeff Agoos
doles out to Poland.</TE>
<TE>   The writer from Argentina is pacing between the two overhead
screens muttering to himself. He goes to his right, looks up, sees
nine-man Portugal yield a goal to the South Koreans and he grunts. He
goes to his left, looks up, sees the lead-footed American defense
give up a third goal to Poland and he throws up his hands in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   "No France! No Argentina! No Portugal!" he fumes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the World Cup!</TE>
<TE>   "This is not serious!"</TE>
<TE>   The United States, while not quite peaking at precisely the right
time, is in the round of 16, unlike France, Argentina and Portugal,
because while the Americans were stinking it up in Daejeon, Portugal
was losing, 1-0, to South Korea to keep the U.S. ahead of Portugal in
the race for second place in Group D.</TE>
<TE>   This sets up, against considerable odds and logic, a U.S.-Mexico
showdown on Monday, with the winner advancing to the World Cup
quarterfinals and the loser, in classic lucha libre fashion, having
to leave town.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the United States against Mexico in a World Cup knockout
game. In our lifetime. In a different time zone. In Jeonju, South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   No frigid February in Columbus, Ohio, with Clint Mathis and Josh
Wolff skittering around shivering Mexican defenders.</TE>
<TE>   No lung-wringing July in Azteca Stadium, with the voices of
100,000 green-clad fans drowning out the Americans' desperate gasps
for oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   A neutral site for the biggest soccer rivalry in North America.
The red, white and blue against the ever-familiar green jerseys,
white shorts and crimson stockings. The Yankees against the Red
Socks.</TE>
<TE>   It could be the best thing to happen to soccer in the region in
ages, if you can forget the niggling incidentals of how the teams got
there.</TE>
<TE>   In three matches in South Korea, the Americans have steadily
backslid from the sublime (USA 3, Portugal 2) to the inevitable
return to earth (USA 1, South Korea 1) to the absolutely absurd
(Poland 2, USA 0 after five minutes). Brought to you by your harried
tour guide for this downhill journey, U.S. central defender Agoos,
who is having such a calamitous World Cup, polite fans here are
starting to wonder, "So, his first sport is baseball, yes?"</TE>
<TE>   Both of Poland's first two goals, coming two minutes apart, were
the result of Agoos misplays. First, he hits the deck trying to clear
a low-level cross, but pops the ball softly in the air, teeing it up
nicely for Poland's Emmanuel Olisadebe. Poland, 1-nil. A few blinks
later, Agoos is beaten to the ball in front of the U.S. net by a
streaking Pawel Kryszalowicz. Poland, 2-nil.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Agoos. He's one of the most likable personalities on the U.S.
squad, stand-up guy and quality teammate. U.S. Coach Bruce Arena
seems to be quite fond of him. But years ago, a colleague said it
best while watching Agoos pull on a practice bib and start jogging
behind the team bench while the U.S. was holding a 2-1 lead over
Mexico:</TE>
<TE>   "There's the equalizing goal warming up on the sideline."</TE>
<TE>   You never want to wish ill will on anyone, especially someone as
personable as Agoos, but how many American television watchers
breathed a sigh of relief when Agoos began clutching his calf around
the 36th minute, soon limping off the field after that? You too?</TE>
<TE>   Worth noting: The U.S. was down, 2-0, when Arena replaced Agoos
with winger DaMarcus Beasley and went with three defenders. After
that, the U.S. played Poland even, one goal apiece. Something to
consider for Mexico, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, meanwhile, is headed in the opposite direction in this
World Cup. Mexico has improved with each game it has played, maxing
out against Italy in Oita, where the Mexicans played one of their
most poised and professional games in years. Courage is a term
bandied about too loosely in sports, but Mexico's performance in the
face of angry Italian elbows in the face qualified--until those final
farcical minutes of playing footsy with the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   On a practical level, the strategy made sense: Italy, after 85
minutes of scrapping, finally drew even. If the score held, Mexico
would advance as leader of the group, Italy would qualify as
runner-up. Everybody goes away happy, and reasonably healthy, right?</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly. Some members of the Mexican media were disturbed by
what they considered an inexcusable capitulation. "It took away the
dignity" of the match, as one writer disappointedly put it.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in Daejeon and Oita amounted to culture shock on
both sides of the border. America loves a winner, but what about a
loser who gets rewarded while getting blown out by Poland? Mexican
machismo allows for no retreat and no surrender, so how can the Tri
simply burn four precious minutes and not even try?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this explains why the United States and Mexico have never
won a World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Italy has, three times, and after South Korea Coach Gus Hiddink
watched his squad withstand Portugal, he elaborated on the reason.
The Italians don't care about playing good games, Hiddink said, they
care only about getting the result.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, the United States and Mexico are learning what
it takes to succeed at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   On the down side, the United States and Mexico are learning what
it takes to succeed at the World Cup.</TE>

<DH>Group D: Park's goal in 70th minute leads to 1-0 victory
and a berth in the second round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INCHEON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>South Korea wasn't about to become the first World Cup host to miss
the second round.</LD>
<LD>   With co-host Japan advancing earlier Friday, South Korea was under
pressure to keep that record intact.</LD>
<LD>   Park Ji-Sung scored in the 70th minute to lead South Korea to a
1-0 victory over Portugal and into the next round.</LD>
<TE>   South Korea's victory allowed it to win Group D and knocked out
the world's fifth-ranked team, touching off celebrations throughout
the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it did a lot for the people of Korea," said Coach Guus
Hiddink, a Dutchman whose popularity has risen with South Korea's
success. "I think we even underestimated a little what it means for
them. It gave me very much satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   The co-hosts play three-time champion Italy in the second round on
Tuesday in Daejeon.</TE>
<TE>   President Kim Dae-jung, who watched the game at the stadium,
visited the locker room and thanked Hiddink and his squad for the
victory, which he called "one of the happiest moments in the nation's
5,000-year history."</TE>
<TE>   Portugal spent much of the match short-handed. Joao Pinto and Beto
received red cards, which left Portugal with nine players and
striving for a tie to advance.</TE>
<TE>   Pinto was dismissed, despite protests from most of the Portuguese
players, after smashing into Park with a two-footed challenge from
behind. Beto was sent off in the 65th minute after receiving his
second yellow card.</TE>
<TE>   The winning goal came after Park took a cross from the left,
chested the ball down, flicked it around a defender and drove a shot
through goalkeeper Vitor Baia's legs.</TE>
<TE>   In the last minute, Sergio Conceicao hit the post with a volley,
one of several chances the Portuguese missed.</TE>

<TE>*--*
4:30 a.m. at Suwon, South Korea
TV: Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 7, 10:30 p.m.; Ch. 46, 2:30 p.m
How they got here: Spain (3-0-0) won Group B; Ireland (1-0-2) was
runner-up in Group E
Sidelined: Spain's Diego Tristan (injured); Ireland's Roy Keane
(banished)
Spain update: Coach Jose Antonio Camacho has the Spanish off to their
best World Cup start in more than a half-century, with the team
undefeated and having scored nine goals in three games. "We've made a
great start to the competition, but all we've done is achieve our
first goal," Camacho said. Spanish strikers Raul, Fernando Morientes
are in top form, as is influential midfielder Luis Enrique
Ireland update: Coach Mick McCarthy has emerged as something of a
national hero after first banishing star midfielder Keane for
insubordination and then taking Ireland into the second round from a
difficult group. "People didn't think we could get where we are now,"
McCarthy said. "People thought we'd get beaten in the first two games
[by Cameroon and Germany]. We fight against doubters and critics all
the time. We do it very well." Ireland's main weapons are Robbie
Keane (no relation) and Damien Duff. They could cause Spain's aging
back line some difficulty
Outlook: Spain has the depth and the talent to win, but the Irish
have the tenacity and team spirit to cause an upset. "In the past,
Spanish sides have not shown respect for smaller nations and have
come unstuck," Camacho said. "No one has had an easy game against
this team [Ireland]. Its mental attitude is stronger than its style
of play." Prediction: Spain 2, Ireland 1</TE>

<TE>   Records--Sparks 6-1, Monarchs 1-4.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Monarchs (2001)--3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Sparks can thank the New York Liberty for losing to
Sacramento in double overtime Thursday, 78-77, so the Monarchs are no
longer desperate for their first win. Still, the first meeting
between last year's Western Conference finalists should be a good
one. Los Angeles has been off since Tuesday's 90-80 home victory over
Detroit. Sacramento is seriously depleted without All-Star center
Yolanda Griffith, who has a bulging disk, and guard Edna Campbell,
who has breast cancer, and will need more games from guard Ticha
Penicheiro like her 23-point, nine-assist effort against New York.
Lisa Leslie's scoring average (17.6) has dipped slightly from last
year (19.5), but she doesn't need to carry the same kind of offensive
load because the Sparks have more scorers. That has freed Leslie to
concentrate on rebounding, and her 12.0 per-game average leads the
WNBA.</TE>

<HD>Football Stadium Plan Withdrawn</HD>
<DH>Development: Wary of local politics and a competing
Coliseum bid, investors drop efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition that launched a drive to bring an NFL team back to Los
Angeles on Friday abruptly announced that it has ended efforts to
build a privately financed football stadium near Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Leiweke, president of the Anschutz Entertainment Group, said
the investors were unwilling to risk millions of dollars amid
fractious local political infighting and an aggressive push by
boosters of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to compete for a
National Football League team.</LD>
<LD>   The withdrawal significantly reduces any chance Los Angeles will
get an NFL team in the foreseeable future. The venerable Coliseum
stands as the obvious alternative for any team considering Los
Angeles. But the league now appears to have dismissed that option.</LD>
<TE>   The turnaround came one day after the group met with downtown
business leaders and civic activists to detail for the first time the
four-block site in the South Park area where it planned to build the
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Although it had the backing of Mayor James K. Hahn, the downtown
stadium plan had also drawn strong criticism from government
officials and others who feared that taxpayer funds would ultimately
be used to help pay for the $450-million, 64,000-seat facility.</TE>
<TE>   The tenor and intensity of the criticism had blindsided investors,
backed by Denver-based billionaire Philip Anschutz, who along with
Leiweke played a key role in the building of Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't want to go through an ugly political process on
this issue," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz group's withdrawal illuminates once again the
divisiveness that makes it difficult to build--or even take the first
steps toward building--a football stadium in Los Angeles acceptable
to local interests and the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the Coliseum Commission decided to allot up to $1
million to promote its venue as an NFL site--a move the Anschutz
group claimed was particularly bewildering because the league has
signaled it is no longer interested in the nearly 80-year-old
facility.</TE>
<TE>   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue as recently as last month said
that the Coliseum is not an option.</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue was not available for comment Friday. But NFL spokesman
Joe Browne said, "We've been down that road before and we have yet to
see a viable stadium plan for an NFL team at the Coliseum."</TE>
<TE>   The position of some of the league's 32 owners was pungently
summarized by Art Modell, owner of the Baltimore Ravens, who said of
the Coliseum: "Trying to put a new dress on an old hooker is not the
way I want to go dancing."</TE>
<TE>   Turning the historic landmark into a state-of-the-art facility
with posh suites and club seats would cost about $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Lynch, the Coliseum's general manager, has said he believes
that a financing plan created in 1999, when the Coliseum was vying to
land the league's 32nd team, can be revived.</TE>
<TE>   But skeptics say that financing plan is overly optimistic, noting
that it is contingent upon receiving a $150-million subsidy from the
NFL and the emergence of a developer willing to come forward with the
money to underwrite the project. So far, no one has expressed
interest in the job.</TE>
<TE>   Coliseum proponents on Friday refused to be portrayed as
spoilsports.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we caused this," Lynch said of the Anschutz group's
withdrawal. "This is a free country. The better deal should always
win."</TE>
<TE>   Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, who
also sits on the Coliseum Commission, was out of the country Friday
but said through a spokesman, "The fact that this is all it took to
collapse the deal just proves it was not ready for prime time. It's a
failed attempt to build a stadium in search of an excuse for that
failure."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams and the Raiders, who left Southern California before the
1995 season, have called the Coliseum home, the Raiders as recently
as 1994.</TE>
<TE>   And Coliseum advocates insist that with the right proposal, the
Coliseum would once again be embraced by the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum was considered the front-runner in the 1999 race to
land an NFL expansion team. But Los Angeles lost that competition to
Houston and Texas businessman Bob McNair, who paid a $700-million
franchise fee.</TE>
<TE>   Lines have long been drawn in the conflict between the Coliseum
and downtown groups.</TE>
<TE>   Months ago, Leiweke said, he had notified key Coliseum backers of
the plan to build in South Park. He also told them that the
competition would push the Anschutz group out of the
picture--unwilling to let the NFL, or league owners, play one site
against the other.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's development looms as a potential setback for Hahn, who
said he has urged the Anschutz group not to give up on the South Park
plan. He also suggested that they might be back: "What I heard from
Tim is they're going to sit back here for a while and let things play
out. If folks at the Coliseum or Rose Bowl or somewhere else want to
come up with a real proposal, they're going to let someone else play
for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said Friday he would not rule out the possibility of
reviving the plan. But, he said, "That's not our intention today.
We're not playing games here."</TE>
<TE>   Just Thursday, Leiweke and one of his partners in the stadium
proposal, Casey Wasserman, owner of the Arena Football League L.A.
Avengers, had briefed a downtown business group on the plan. They had
for the first time publicly disclosed the proposed site--land bounded
by 11th Street and Pico Boulevard, and Hope and Olive streets.</TE>
<TE>   The horseshoe-shaped facility would have been tiered--a Los
Angeles first--and would have offered a view of downtown. Its facade
would have resembled that of Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   In leading the push to build the arena, which opened in 1999,
Anschutz and Leiweke demonstrated they had the clout and credibility
needed to navigate L.A. politics.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz, one of America's richest men, has built a sports and
entertainment empire that includes ownership of the National Hockey
League Kings and the Major League Soccer Galaxy and part ownership of
the Lakers and five European hockey clubs. Besides Wasserman, other
financial backers of the South Park proposal included supermarket
mogul Ron Burkle and real estate developer Ed Roski.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council last month gave its final approval to a downtown
redevelopment district that included the football site.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Chargers and Minnesota Vikings quickly emerged as
the most likely candidates for a move and the NFL offered its quiet
approval. In meetings with Leiweke and Wasserman, the league
indicated it would support the effort with a $150-million loan,
perhaps even more, to subsidize stadium construction.</TE>
<TE>   AEG already owns much of the land or holds options to buy other
pieces in the four-block parcel. In recent months, it had invested $5
million in land or options; in the coming weeks, it was looking at
further investment of at least $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   The investors wanted the city to use its right of eminent domain
to help piece together the rest of the land. The plan called for the
Community Redevelopment Agency to buy all 20 acres, at a cost Leiweke
estimated at $70 million to $100 million, to be paid with bond funds.
The developers promised to pay that money back from a combination of
a ticket tax, sales tax and excess property tax from the site.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the AEG pitch: no public money, and a financing model based
on the successful Staples development.</TE>
<TE>   Within short order, however, the plan came under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Critics on the City Council, in the press and elsewhere expressed
concern that taxpayer money would be used to help pay for the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors voted to sue the city, arguing
that the redevelopment plan that would ease the way for a new stadium
ultimately strips tax revenue from the county.</TE>
<TE>   The city of San Diego sent AEG a letter hinting at legal action if
the group tried to woo the Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   And, in perhaps the most important snag, the Coliseum Commission
voted its $1-million allocation.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, as he readied for the Lakers' victory celebration in
front of Staples Center, Leiweke grew reflective.</TE>
<TE>   "When people say, 'You know, you went through two years of battles
to get Staples Center done. What made you think this would be any
different?' ... The difference is we went through two years of
battles and finally ended up negotiating a model that was acceptable
to the city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is another key difference, he said. AEG needed Staples to
provide a home for the Lakers and the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to get that arena done for the future of those two
teams. We don't own a team today," he said. "It's not like we have an
NFL team that is in a difficult economic situation playing in a very
poor facility. We don't have a team. We don't need to build a
football stadium."</TE>

<TE>*--*
Tonight, 11:30, at Oita, Japan
TV: ESPN, Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 46, noon, Sunday
How they got here: Sweden finished first in Group F with a 1-0-2
record. Senegal took second in Group A at 1-0-2
Sidelined: Senegal's Salif Diao (suspended) and Khalilou Fadiga
(suspended)
Sweden update: Sweden was a surprising first-place finisher in the
toughest group in the tournament. The Swedes, bronze medalists in
1994, have the ingredients--goalkeeping, defense and Henrik
Larsson--and the draw to make a similar run to the semifinals. Should
they defeat Senegal, the Swedes would play either Japan or Turkey in
the quarterfinals. Goalie Magnus Hedman pulled a back muscle against
Argentina, concerning team doctors, but Hedman says, "It will take a
hell of a lot to keep me out of a World Cup last-16 game. I count on
being able to play."
Senegal update: Cameroon and Nigeria are out, leaving lesser heralded
Senegal to carry the African banner into the knockout phase. It did
not, however, advance wholly intact. Starting midfielders Diao and
Fadiga are suspended for this match and right back Ferdinand Coly is
questionable because of a knee injury
Outlook: Senegal's first sprint into the World Cup was a first-round
highlight, but once the tournament grows longer, the harsh
realities--injuries, attrition--have a way of weeding out newcomers.
Sweden knows the drill, and attacking winger Fredrik Ljungberg is
expected to return from the hip injury that kept him out of the
Argentina match. Sweden advances</TE>

<DL>DAEJEON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>The American players found themselves in a peculiar emotional state
Friday night--wanting to celebrate the U.S. team reaching the second
round but upset after being beaten by Poland.</LD>
<LD>   The victory wrapped in a loss left them bewildered.</LD>
<LD>   "I told Brian [McBride] in the locker room after the game, 'What
an unbelievable roller coaster ride,' " Landon Donovan said. "It was
like, 'We're down, 2-0,' then 'We're down, 3-0,' then there is a
penalty kick. Then I score a goal and I think, 'I can't celebrate.'
Then I look at the bench and see my teammates cheering and the crowd
cheering and I'm thinking, 'Did Korea score?' It was just up and
down. A little too much."</LD>
<TE>   Frankie Hejduk felt the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a weird feeling," he said. "We're losing and we definitely
didn't have a great game, so we're disappointed about that, but at
the same time we're thankful that we made the second round."</TE>
<TE>   McBride was confused too.</TE>
<TE>   "When you lose a game, you're never happy," he said. "But this
time you have to have a little bit of joy because of the things we
did before today. It's weird. I've never felt like that after a
soccer game, especially one I've lost."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donovan put the ball into the Polish net twice, but the first
time, in the fourth minute, didn't count because referee Lu Jun of
China ruled that Donovan had fouled defender Arkadiusz Glowacki
before heading the ball in.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan disputed that.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I, about 5-foot-8 and a buck and a half [150 pounds]?"
Donovan asked reporters. "That guy is 6-2 , 210. I don't think I'm
strong enough to move him. I think he flopped, but that's the way it
goes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who saved a penalty kick in the U.S.'s
1-1 tie with South Korea, repeated the feat against Poland when he
dived to his left to deny Maciej Zurawski in the 76th minute after
Tony Sanneh tripped Pawel Kryszalowicz.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to keep giving teams penalties," Friedel said.
"It's not like you can save them every time they take them on you.
You try to read them and try to guess on them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Bruce Arena was asked by a television interviewer after
the game to explain how South Korea and the U.S. could have finished
ahead of Portugal and Poland in Group D.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think at the end of the day anyone would have picked the
results in this group," he replied. "Nor would they have picked the
results throughout the World Cup. It's been an unusual World Cup to
date, and it'll be an interesting round of 16 ahead of us."</TE>

<HD>Second Helping for U.S.</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Americans badly outplayed in 3-1 loss to Poland but
advance to face Mexico in next round, thanks to South Korea's 1-0 win
over Portugal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAEJEON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>There's a lot to be said for having a dependable ally--in war, in
peace and, as it turns out, in soccer.</LD>
<LD>   The United States, needing only a tie against Poland on Friday
night to clinch a place in the final 16 of the World Cup, failed
miserably. It was outplayed by the Poles from the opening whistle and
ended up losing, 3-1.</LD>
<LD>   But it is going to the second round anyway.</LD>
<TE>   South Korea's Park Ji-Sung earned the U.S. its berth--and one for
his own country too--by scoring the lone goal at Incheon as the
Koreans ousted Portugal from the tournament with a surprise 1-0
victory over the fifth-ranked team in the world.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea won Group D, with the U.S. finishing second.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will play longtime rival Mexico in Jeonju on Monday for a
place in the quarterfinals. South Korea will play three-time world
champion Italy in Daejeon on Tuesday, also seeking to be one of the
final eight.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team would have been on a plane heading home today were
it not for the Koreans' pluck.</TE>
<TE>   "We're through to the second round because of their result, not
because of what we did," admitted midfielder Claudio Reyna, the U.S.
captain. "We really needed a point today and we couldn't do it. So,
yes, we owe them a big thanks. They went out and won, and that's
great."</TE>
<TE>   Not that doing the U.S. a favor was necessarily the Koreans' aim.</TE>
<TE>   "They really weren't playing for us, they were playing for
themselves," Cobi Jones said, "but we've just got to thank them for
the result they got. Thankfully, it went the way that we needed it to
go."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing else went the Americans' way on a night when only
goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who saved a penalty kick for the second game
in a row, and midfielder John O'Brien managed to raise their game to
World Cup level.</TE>
<TE>   Poland came into the match with a point to prove and did so in no
uncertain fashion, playing the fastbreak to perfection and scoring
twice in the first five minutes to stun the crowd of 26,482 at
Daejeon World Cup Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The goals also stunned the U.S. players.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of slumping in the chairs," said Jones, who was
on the bench at the time. "I was in my own little world, just
wondering what had happened in those first five minutes. I guess I
kind of felt like the Portuguese did when they took a goal in the
first few minutes [in an earlier 3-2 loss to the U.S.]."</TE>
<TE>   Poland Coach Jerzy Engel had said Thursday that despite already
being eliminated after losing its first two games, his team would not
do any of its group rivals any favors Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is beautiful, the people are amazing and we did not
expect such a warm welcome in Korea," he said. "But unfortunately,
when the national team is playing, it plays only for the nation. We
are not playing for Korea; we are not playing for the U.S. We are
Poles and we play for Poland."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Engel made sweeping changes to his lineup, dropping
starting goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, along with defenders Michal Zewlakow
and Tomasz Hajto and midfielder Piotr Swierczewski, all of whom had
started in 2-0 and 4-0 losses to South Korea and Portugal,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, midfielder Radoslaw Kaluzny, whom U.S. Coach Bruce
Arena had described as "a dangerous player," was sidelined by injury.</TE>
<TE>   The only U.S. change was the return of Earnie Stewart from injury,
which meant that DaMarcus Beasley was dropped as a starter and Landon
Donovan took his spot in left midfield.</TE>
<TE>   The new-look Polish team attacked from the outset and it took the
Poles a mere three minutes to grab the lead. Defender Jeff Agoos,
under pressure from Polish forward Cezary Kucharski, only partially
cleared the ball and it fell to Emmanuel Olisadebe, the Nigerian-born
striker who was Poland's leading goal scorer in qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Olisadebe unleashed a shot that slammed into the crossbar and
rebounded into the U.S. net. That was the first strike and the game
was only three minutes old.</TE>
<TE>   The second came only two minutes later and left Arena shaking his
head on the U.S bench</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Jacek Kryznowek, a thorn in the U.S. team's side all
night, got free on the left and crossed the ball past defender Eddie
Pope and into the path of onrushing forward Pawel Kryszalowicz, who
shouldered his way past Agoos and side-footed the ball into the net
just inside the left post.</TE>
<TE>   "On the first goal, we were slow to react to Olisadebe," Friedel
said. "We had said that he's very, very quick, very unpredictable at
times, and he got to a loose ball. I just tried to go out and throw
him off in any way and he flashed it by us.</TE>
<TE>   "The second goal again was [scored by] a runner who got in behind
our defense. The most important saves, the most important tackles,
the most important headers, whatever it is, sometimes are after a
goal. We didn't do that today.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it was a good wake-up call for us. If we had won, maybe we
would have gone into the Mexico game a bit cocky. Maybe this was a
wake-up call and we'll go into the Mexico game very, very tight."</TE>
<TE>   Clint Mathis hit the foot of the left post with a shot late in the
game and Donovan scored in the 83rd minute for the U.S., but by then
the game was long over.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico is an outstanding team," Arena said. "They'll be a very
difficult opponent for us on Monday. It's our job now over the next
72 hours to get our team physically and mentally ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   That task will be complicated by the loss of two defenders. Agoos
left Friday's match in the 36th minute and afterward was on crutches
after injuring his left foot. Frankie Hejduk is suspended for one
game after picking up his second yellow card of the first round for
tripping Olisadebe.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the opponent Monday is Mexico and perhaps, like South
Korea, it will do the U.S. a good turn. After all, what are neighbors
for?</TE>

<HD>L.A.'s Escalating Home Prices Are Bad for Business</HD>
<DH>We can't afford the development wars that prevent creation
of much- needed housing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRUNWALD</AU>
<BD>David Grunwald is chief executive of L.A. Family
Housing.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a decade of strong economic growth, Los Angeles suffers from
a profound housing shortage. This shortage has propelled home prices
to record levels and increased rents by double-digit percentages.</LD>
<LD>   Though increased property values and escalating rents may be good
news for some homeowners and landlords, it's a bad omen for local
businesses and our economy.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of reasonably priced housing in Los Angeles is wreaking
havoc on local employers who struggle to recruit and retain permanent
employees. Increasingly, prospective employees balk at job offers
because working here means high-priced housing or a two-hour-a-day
commute.</LD>
<TE>   Droves of modestly paid service workers and middle-income
professionals are migrating from L.A. to the Inland Empire to find
more affordable housing and stable jobs.</TE>
<TE>   We have no place to house our nurses, teachers and cops, not to
mention our busboys, nannies and janitors.</TE>
<TE>   Availability of decent and reasonably priced housing is vital to
supporting a vibrant work force in our city. Without more housing,
our work force will deteriorate. Business growth will slow, our
economy will recede and all of us will feel the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn recently launched an important initiative
calling for a dramatic expansion of the city's investment in housing
from $10 million last year to $100 million annually by 2005. Though
this new investment is a critical first step, many Angelenos are
hostile to any housing development in their communities. Proposed
developments that could provide thousands of units of housing for all
income levels are routinely attacked from their inception by those
who don't want increased density, traffic and other negative effects
in their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Our city can no longer afford the costly development wars that
slow and squash necessary housing production.</TE>
<TE>   As the supply of housing stalls, prices will continue their upward
spiral and more workers will leave. We no longer can let a
reactionary, not-in-my-backyard mentality thwart our city's future
economic progress.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid this real and looming threat, we must create a new,
collaborative paradigm. It must be sensitive to community needs but
also promote thoughtful housing development. It should empower local
politicians to expeditiously resolve development disputes and
implement a "smart"-growth plan for the city.</TE>
<TE>   This new paradigm should allow concerned stakeholders to oppose
unlawful and environmentally incompatible development. It should give
city planners and managers the tools, resources and support they need
to develop a "can-do" attitude toward housing development.</TE>
<TE>   And it should give developers the green light to build when they
propose housing projects that meet building, safety and environmental
laws.</TE>

<HD>We All Should Have a Say on Home-Care Measure</HD>
<DH>Initiative assisting seniors and the disabled belongs on
the ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARVIN SCHACHTER</AU>
<BD>Marvin Schachter is a member of the executive committee
of the California Commission on the Aging.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The population of senior citizens is growing at an almost exponential
rate, with the over-60 population expected to double by 2020 and the
over-85 population projected to triple by 2030.</LD>
<LD>   If we don't address the concerns facing this population, we are
going to find ourselves in a fiscal crisis.</LD>
<LD>   How our nation handles these concerns--from housing to health
care--will define us.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the pleas of seniors sometimes go unheard and their
needs unconsidered.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking example of this is the recent action of the L.A.
County Board of Supervisors to quash a ballot measure in support of
home care--a critical safety net for more than 100,000 low-income,
fragile seniors and people with disabilities in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The board's sneaky attempts to keep the measure from seeing the
light of day did not go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   A determined and hard-working coalition of senior citizens and
people with disabilities, along with minimum-wage home health-care
workers, overcame the supervisors' tactics to ensure that the measure
would be put before the public. They collected more than 380,000
signatures from voters who support placing the Homecare Protection
Act on the November 2002 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons home health care is so essential is that it
puts at ease one of the most disturbing fears facing our seniors:
that they will one day have to move out of their homes and into
institutional care facilities because of their diminished ability to
care for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Home is where we raise our families, live our lives, spend time
with friends and neighbors. It's wrong to rob seniors of the ability
to stay in their homes or demand they do so only at the risk of their
well-being.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the alternatives to home health care are more costly to
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors deserve the dignity and independence that come with living
in their own homes. Home assistance is what makes that independence
possible.</TE>
<TE>   The Homecare Protection Act would protect home-care services by
creating a stable work force. It would lift home-care workers and
their families out of poverty and give them health insurance, paid
vacation and sick time. (A home-care worker earns just $6.75 an hour
and receives no vacation or sick pay.)</TE>
<TE>   The initiative also would provide essential home-care service
improvements, such as emergency-care and enhanced home-care worker
training. The Homecare Protection Act speaks to our collective
concern and regard for the needs and rights of our senior citizens
and people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   With all that said, supporting the Homecare Protection Act of 2002
is simply the right thing to do. Why should anyone be denied the
right to remain in his home simply because he needs extra assistance
with the daily chores so many of us often take for granted?</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. County Board of Supervisors should be encouraged to place
the measure on the November 2002 ballot.</TE>

<HD>Tracing a Nonbeliever's Journey From Conversion to
Disillusionment</HD>
<DH>THIS DARK WORLD: A Memoir of Salvation Found and Lost; By
Carolyn S. Briggs; Bloomsbury: 310 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH ANDREW ELLENSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So what do you do with yourself when you've dedicated your life to
Jesus at 18, and then, 20 years later, find that a life dedicated to
the Lord is not all it's cracked up to be?</LD>
<LD>   That's the question Carolyn Briggs attempts to answer in her
elegant memoir, "This Dark World." It is a rare portrait from the
vantage point of the believer, and Briggs unflinchingly documents her
faith--in its first bloom, when she finds God--and then her growing
disillusionment.</LD>
<LD>   She follows her journey of "salvation found and lost," as the
subtitle proclaims, with a portrait of the tightly wrapped religious
community and an equally heartfelt depiction of how she was
suffocated by that world and struggled to free herself from it.</LD>
<TE>   Initially disgusted by a childhood friend who became a "Jesus
freak" and tried to proselytize her, Briggs, who was married and had
a daughter by the age of 18, found herself opening to her friend's
beliefs. Briggs and her then-husband, Eric, a would-be rock star,
went from being nonbelievers to fundamentalists after buying a
paperback, paraphrased, modern-language version of the Bible at
Walgreens.</TE>
<TE>   The teenage couple discovered the joy of God together while living
in a trailer on the edge of Des Moines with their baby. "In a split
second, we crossed to the other side," Briggs writes of that
transformative moment. "There was no turning back now.... We cried.
It was the first moment of absolute magic I had ever lived. There was
a God. There was. There was."</TE>
<TE>   Eric gave up his life with his band, Renegade, to spread the word
of Jesus, and Briggs was freed from the intense isolation she felt as
a poor young mother. At the time, she was convinced she had found the
only road to eternal life and happiness, and discovered that her
sense of purpose in life blossomed: "Every time I looked at my hands,
I was conscious that they were Christ's. Every part of my body: his.
He was continuing his earthly ministry using my body. It was
sobering. It was also thrilling."</TE>
<TE>   The first third of the book sets the stage for her vulnerability:
She is the less-pretty sister, the child of divorced parents, the one
who longs most for attention, acceptance and love. She finds a
perfect replacement for her absentee father in God. Although it might
read as the classic setup for a woman destined to succumb to a life
she will soon struggle to free herself from, Briggs treads this
ground lightly, carefully probing the painful self-exploration that
is so fundamental in adolescence and young adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   The book becomes most engrossing when Briggs chronicles her
experiences in a 1970s community of fundamentalist Christians. The
details are extraordinary: Women are expected to nurse one another's
babies; eating of health food is enforced almost as dogmatically as
the dogma itself; and women--even when they wear full-length
skirts--are condemned for tempting their "brothers," the men of the
community, by dressing immodestly. The formality of the gender roles
is rigid: Men are the heads of households and women the mothers and
caretakers. Though Briggs finds this structure comforting at first,
it later begins to smother her.</TE>
<TE>   Her world begins to crumble when she discovers that her
11-month-old daughter, Lauren, has been hit as a disciplinary action
by a man in the community. When she rushes into the man's home with
her bruised child, she is met with bewildered stares and told
brusquely that the child is being taught to obey and that she must
mind her own business.</TE>
<TE>   Her break from the community takes place over several years,
culminating when she decides, at 34, to take the step of going to
college. Outside the religious framework of her community, she comes
into her own as an intellectually curious woman, splintering away
from the cloistered world in which she has lived.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the veneer of her perfect faith begins to crack, she
has had three children with Eric. Briggs mysteriously lets the effect
her transformation has on them remain mostly untold. As she comes
into her own at the end of the book--earning her bachelor's degree at
38 from the University of Arkansas, enrolling in a master of fine
arts program, living in Ireland and writing--her children are
beginning to lead their own lives.</TE>
<TE>   As liberating as it may have been for Briggs to shed her cocoon
and fully metamorphose into the person she was destined to be, one
does wonder how all of this played out in the minds of her children.
For such a careful observer of her own story, Briggs remains oddly
silent in observing her transformation in them. She may have lost
others on the road to finding herself.</TE>

<LD>NASA still suffers its share of costly excesses (think International
Space Station). But sometimes it does just the right thing. At a
press conference Tuesday, NASA officials held up a new probe called
Contour--short for Comet Nucleus Tour--scheduled to be launched July
1, as a model of the cost-effective, science-rich missions the agency
needs more of. The 2,100-pound, $60-million probe will fly by two
comets in an attempt to discover what they are made of.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists hope the mission will help them evaluate the theory
that comets once carried to Earth the water and organic materials
necessary for life. But there's a second and more compelling reason
to hope that NASA's Delta rockets safely deliver the black-and-gold
satellite into space next month: Contour is the first of several
probes NASA is launching to help develop a strategy for the day,
considered inevitable in the long run, when a monster asteroid or
comet takes aim at Earth.</LD>
<LD>   The second probe, a $279-million spacecraft dubbed Deep Impact,
will intercept a comet and use a projectile to blow a huge hole in it
to see what's inside. It is slated for launch in January 2004. Think
of the movie potential.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Yeomans, who manages Contour and some of NASA's other Near
Earth Objects missions from his office in Pasadena's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, explained this week that more than 1,000 large objects
capable of striking Earth are circling through the solar system. Only
half have been studied even cursorily.</TE>
<TE>   "It pays to know the enemy," Yeomans pointed out. "If one is
coming toward us with our name on it, it makes a big difference in
what you are going to do with it, if it is a fluff ball or solid
iron."</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that NASA has completed its cost-efficiency
mission. While Yeomans was briefing reporters Tuesday, two astronauts
were attaching a crane to the International Space Station. The U.S.
will have spent $23.4 billion by 2004 on the space station. Congress
should scrutinize that project to prevent it from becoming a waste.
Legislators should, for instance, press NASA to recoup some costs by
charging pharmaceutical companies and others hungering to perform
zero-gravity studies in its labs. Or if that fails, sell satin bomber
jackets with Comet Nucleus Tour 2002 embroidered on the back. They'd
be huge.</TE>

<LD>President Bush wants Congress to set aside $300 million in the
welfare reform law to promote "healthy, stable marriages." To
proponents of the fund, that means programs urging marriage and
counseling to keep couples together. The money should be spent on
something more than promoting marriage; it should be spent on one
obvious element that helps encourage a strong marriage: financial
stability. That means much of it should go for vocational training
and jobs.</LD>
<LD>   In 1965, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an assistant secretary of
Labor, documented the breakup of the two-parent black family in a
seminal and controversial report, "The Negro Family: A Case for
National Action."</LD>
<LD>   Moynihan was able to show "an extraordinarily powerful correlation
between male unemployment rates and certain indices of family
stability--single-parent households, husbands absent and so forth."
He also could show an extremely strong correlation between the black
male unemployment rate in a given month and 80% of the new black
welfare cases six months later.</LD>
<TE>   The problem was exacerbated as factories offering low-skill,
well-paying jobs left the cities. Around the same time, Great Society
programs like Head Start helped poor children, but some poverty
programs, such as welfare, had rules that encouraged fathers not to
live with or support the mothers of their children.</TE>
<TE>   From 1963 to 2000, the percentage of out-of-wedlock births
increased nearly threefold for blacks and almost tenfold for whites.
Single motherhood exploded across racial, ethnic, income and
geographic lines. Divorces broke up more families. Welfare rolls
multiplied. The Aid to Families With Dependent Children program
became a permanent means of support, passing from one generation of
fatherless children to the next, until in 1996 the White House and
Congress said "enough."</TE>
<TE>   Children born to married parents and who grow up with two parents
are more likely to be healthier and do better in school. They are
less likely to grow up poor, flunk out, suffer abuse or neglect, have
children out of wedlock, go on welfare or go to jail. But a stable
family doesn't happen by decree.</TE>
<TE>   The White House and Congress can't and shouldn't force "shotgun"
marriages; however, laws can change behavior and reverse trends. As
the Senate Finance Committee considers the reauthorization of the
federal welfare law as early as next week, it should be guided by the
experience of the last few decades, as well as by common sense:
Marriage matters, but so does the parental ability to pay the bills.</TE>

<LD>Poets speak of mountains as eternal. The ancients feared them as the
abodes of dragons or demons. Nineteenth century climbers went to
conquer them. Modern climbers toil to cleanse them of the trash left
by their predecessors. And mountains are far too often the stage for
rebellion and warfare.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, high mountains are fragile and subject to environmental
damage, swarmed by tourism and chipped away by indiscriminate
development. The challenges to mountain ranges throughout the world
are so daunting that the United Nations has declared 2002 the
International Year of Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The action stems from a determination at the Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro 10 years ago that threats to mountain areas were as
serious as rain forest destruction and the man-made deserts creeping
across dry areas of the world.</LD>
<TE>   Conferences and forums are being held around the globe to increase
awareness of threats to mountain areas and take steps to protect
them. One is the Banff Mountain Summit in the Canadian Rockies Oct.
27 to 29 in conjunction with the annual Banff film and book
festivals. Renowned mountaineers such as Reinhold Messner, the first
to reach the summit of all 14 of the world's 8,000-meter peaks
(that's 26,247 feet, for Americans), and Patagonia outdoor clothing
company founder Yvon Chouinard, will discuss topics such as the
culture of extreme landscapes and corporate responsibility in the
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The Year of Mountains also will be noted Sept. 28 at a Denver
dinner and forum of the American Alpine Club celebrating the 100th
anniversary of the climbing club's founding. The organization's goals
include the promotion and dissemination of knowledge about mountains
and their conservation and preservation.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the mountains of Kashmir is legendary. That has not
deterred India and Pakistan from a nuclear-tinged standoff over
control of the region. The United States has fought Taliban and Al
Qaeda in the forbidding mountains of eastern Afghanistan. The
mountainside bobsled run for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo was
a fire base for Bosnian Serb gunners' attacks on the city a few years
later.</TE>
<TE>   Another major problem is the melting of alpine glaciers due to
climate change. Mountains are the source for half the world's water
supply. In the Andes, the Quelccaya ice cap, the main water source
for Lima, Peru, is receding 300 feet a year, 10 times its shrinkage
rate a decade ago. Water experts fear the same will happen to the
snowpack of California's Sierra Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about mountains' problems will not solve them. But as
government officials become aware of these threats, they can seek
solutions. Perhaps it will be as William Blake wrote in the early
19th century: "Great things are done when men and mountains meet."</TE>

<LD>Re "New Life Vs. Old Murder," June 7: I was a child during the
Symbionese Liberation Army's reign of violence. It was a very unusual
and frightening time. It is commendable that Emily Harris has changed
her life. But that does not excuse crimes. In fact, if she has
changed so much she should be confessing her past and be willing to
pay her debt to society and to her victims.</LD>
<LD>   Good behavior does not negate bad behavior. If she committed this
killing of an innocent woman, then she should be punished according
to the law. Many people rebel in their youth, but most do not go on a
journey of anger, hatred and violence. We are all accountable for our
actions, all of our actions. It is time for her and the others in her
group to be judged by the system we have set forth in this country.</LD>
<LD>   We can only hope her story will touch the youth of today and let
them know we cannot always undo the grave mistakes of our youth.
There will be a price. For all of us, who even in our youth have
strived to be decent and good human beings and have tried to make the
world a better place for everyone, we need there to be justice. Emily
Harris, it is time for you to atone.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding racial profiling, my compliments to the watchful eyes of
Southwest Airlines. This is the first time since my trips from
Heathrow Airport in London to the U.S. that I have experienced such
professionally executed security checks. Yes, I was the "chosen
one"--a white woman (not girl), well dressed, with all my
credentials, returning from a full day at our Capitol in Sacramento
in meetings with some of our Assembly members and state senators, and
a congressional reception that was given for us. We were
representatives of the Public Policy Committee for the Beverly
Hills/Greater Los Angeles Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   We went through the regular check, received our boarding passes
and were about to board the plane when a security officer randomly
chose to reinspect me. My first reaction was shock, but then I was
pleased at their tenacity and told them so. They kept apologizing,
but I told them that their care for our safety made me feel secure. I
was thanked so much for not being angry and told them that in no way
did I take offense, and I thanked them. I realized that choosing
someone who all thought was the least likely candidate to be a
terrorist was done with real insight.</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of their choice, be grateful. Who knows what a
terrorist can really look like? Better to be safe than sorry.
Congratulations, Southwest Airlines.</LD>

<TE>   It should be noted to Michael Ramirez that in the days of the
kings, such as the one in his June 11 editorial cartoon "Cinderella,"
the king would hold complete power and could wield it unilaterally.
Often kings were referred to as being more sacred than their
citizens. Is Ramirez advocating that we award the government such
powers?</TE>
<TE>   Besides the blatant difference between being asked to try on a
shoe because you're white and being arrested or harassed because
you're not, Ramirez's anachronistic inclusion of the civil rights
lawyer only hurts his argument by highlighting the liberal standpoint
of how far we've come, and how far we have yet to go.</TE>

<TE>   This country is at war--a war initiated by Muslim extremists who
have vowed to destroy us. While most Muslims are not terrorists, all
terrorists in this case are Muslims. Recognizing that, racial or
religious profiling is a necessary evil. While some innocents may
suffer as a result, it is far better that this occur rather than
experiencing a repeat of the Sept. 11 World Trade Center horror.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest of Jose Padilla, who changed his name to Abdullah al
Muhajir, should serve as a frightening reminder of the catastrophe
facing all of us as a result of Muslim fanaticism ("U.S. Citizen
Accused of Planning an Attack Using a 'Dirty' Bomb," June 11).</TE>
<TE>   Racial profiling at its worst is practiced by Muslim and Arab
radicals who label all Christians, Jews and Americans as infidels
deserving of death. Now that is racial profiling. Until moderate
Muslims take a more aggressive stance in condemning Al Qaeda and the
jihad, we have no alternative but to suspect them of support and
possible complicity. Our civil liberties are not at stake. Our
survival is.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Growing Numbers, Palestinian Boys Are Choosing the Brief Life
of a 'Martyr,' " by Tracy Wilkinson, June 10: How utterly pathetic to
read another article detailing how Palestinian parents and Hamas
encourage little boys to blow up innocent people. No just god would
look on these children as martyrs. Perhaps if they, or anyone, died
peacefully for a cause in the name of their god there would be hope
for salvation. Sadly, the only martyrs in this equation are the
victims. As for the parents of these suicide-bomber children, a pox
on all of them. It is mental sickness and the ignorant belief that
the God of all humanity is really only on the Palestinian and/or Arab
side.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinians must wonder, even occasionally, why Israeli
children (or adults) don't do the same thing. They don't because it
is insidiously barbaric; if an Israeli child blew up 17 innocent
Palestinians, that child's family would likely be scorned and
ashamed, not to mention the possibility of the parents being arrested
as accomplices. That is the bottom-line difference between the
protagonists.</LD>
<LD>   Gregg Freeman</LD>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a recent visit by Israeli army intelligence officer Col. Miri
Eisen, we learned that Palestinian terror attacks, including those
committed by the 14-year-olds referred to in Wilkinson's article,
require four elements: people, weapons, money and education.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Israeli military and the Palestinian security forces can,
if and when they wish, deal with the people, the weapons and the
money. But when Palestinian mothers reinforce this "love for
martyrdom" in their sons, when Palestinian textbooks fail to
acknowledge the existence of the state of Israel and when Palestinian
state-run television shows "endless, violent images" (of Palestinians
as victims, never showing Israeli victims of Palestinian terror), the
possibility of peaceful coexistence seems impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to Wilkinson's assertions that Palestinian terror is
based on "frustration" over Israeli roadblocks and checkpoints, a
more honest assessment is that it is based on a well-coordinated
indoctrination policy by the Palestinian Authority. Peace can only be
achieved when, as the late Israeli Prime Minister GoIda Meir once
said, Palestinians love their children more than they hate us.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Aid Groups Say Israel Impedes Relief Work," June 11: If
they're looking for the moral high ground, Richard Cook and the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency have a long climb ahead. It was under the
U.N. agency's auspices, after all, that Jenin was transformed into a
hornets' nest of terrorists. It is the U.N. agency that operates
Palestinian schools in which kindergartners are taught to hate Jews,
surrounded by posters glorifying suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Cook referred to Kosovo. Israeli physicians and other medical
personnel provided substantial aid to Muslim refugees living in camps
in Macedonia during that conflict. Indeed, a number of children born
in that period are named after the Israeli doctors who attended their
birth. When it comes to humanitarian aid, I'll take the record of the
Israelis over that of Cook and the U.N. agency any day.</TE>

<HD>Kaiser Permanente: Part of a Health Community</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his June 10 commentary, "HMOs Stalk Patients' Rights," Jamie Court
describes a Kaiser Permanente that exists only in his mind and in the
minds of his trial attorney cohorts. It's time for the truth. The
health-care organizations that comprise Kaiser Permanente--Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and the
Permanente Medical Groups--supported the creation of the Department
of Managed Health Care and continue to support strong, principled and
effective regulation of health plans by the DMHC. We believe
Californians agree with us that the DMHC has no authority to regulate
physicians and how they operate their medical practices.</LD>
<LD>   While we believe that the DMHC has a legitimate role in overseeing
health plans to ensure access, continuity of care and quality, we
disagree with the DMHC regarding the scope of its authority in a
recent case cited by Court. So too did the administrative law judge
who rejected every single allegation the DMHC brought about access
and continuity of care in that specific case. The judge's decision is
consistent with the medical board's conclusion that the medical care
in this case met community standards. It should be noted that this
case did not involve quality-of-care allegations or a health plan's
responsibility to have an effective quality-assurance program.</LD>
<TE>   Court's irresponsible remarks are insulting to the many thousands
of dedicated physicians, nurses and other health-care workers at
Kaiser Permanente who care for more than 6.3 million Californians.
The truth is that while we are not perfect, each day the people of
Kaiser Permanente strive to provide quality, affordable health care
to our communities.</TE>

<LD>Re "Missile Data to Be Kept Secret," June 9: It's nice to see, again,
the hypocrisy of our elected leaders exposed. By refusing to release
information about their pet (or should I say pork?) missile defense
program, the Bush administration only looks more and more like it has
something to hide.</LD>
<LD>   When the administration hears protests from the public about the
FBI's new powers to invade our privacy, the response is generally:
"If you don't have anything to hide, then you shouldn't be afraid of
our scrutiny." Well, Mr. Bush and Mr. Ashcroft, why are you afraid?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Wrong Time for a New Prison" (editorial, June 7) implies that the
state is spending $595 million from the state budget to build Delano
II at a time when the state is facing a fiscal crisis. The actual
cost of construction for Delano II is $335 million, which would come
not from the general fund but from lease revenue bonds. Most of that
impact would not be seen in the state budget for four to five years.</LD>
<LD>   Most California prisons are operating at 180% to 195% of capacity.
Thousands of inmates are doubled up in cells built for one person.
Gymnasiums and classrooms have been converted to dormitories. Such
overcrowding breeds inmate violence, the potential for the spread of
disease and fewer opportunities to participate in educational and
rehabilitative programs. It is true that the number of
minimum-security inmates is declining. There is, however, an acute
shortage of maximum-security cells. The new Delano II facility would
be a maximum-security prison.</LD>
<TE>   Your editorial relied on decade-old national data to conclude that
the crime rate is rising for people who have been released from
prison. Recent California data tell a different story. In California
in 1999, 72% of the inmates were returning to prison within two years
of their release. Today, the rate is 54% and falling, in response to
better parole supervision, expanded job placement and other programs
for parolees. That figure is still too high, yet it represents
significant progress.</TE>

of cowardly politicians like Gov. Gray Davis and Assemblyman Rod

crime" mob mentality gripping this state, and who continually stand
in the way of every decent, sensible and cost-effective alternative
to the overreliance on incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   That these politicians and their ilk feel compelled to dwell on
the inhumanity of these feeble and aging inmates, no doubt to justify
their own inhumanity toward them, speaks volumes about the malicious
and vindictive nature of our current system of justice.</TE>
<TE>   What these elected officials ought to be aware of is that their
constituents include, in growing numbers, the families and loved ones
of prisoners, and we will not be silent for much longer.</TE>

<LD>Re "Governor Feeling Little Political Fallout From the Dot-Com Bust,"
June 10: According to your news article, few blame Gov. Gray Davis
for the tech crash in Silicon Valley; after all, voters up there
"appreciate his tolerant stance on issues such as abortion and gay
rights."</LD>
<LD>   I guess voters are not blaming Davis for the Chicago fire or the
Johnstown flood, but that does not mean our governor has not failed
in several other areas.</LD>
<LD>   He has led our state from having an $8-billion surplus to a
$23.6-billion deficit. Our governor also failed miserably in managing
last year's energy crisis, which resulted in skyrocketing prices and
power blackouts affecting manufacturing and production. He has also
failed to keep his promise to improve California schools, which
continue to remain largely substandard. Finally, he has failed to
create jobs in this state, except for those added to the taxpayers'
payroll during his administration.</LD>

mediocrity.</TE>

Davis hoping none of us taxpayers can do the math?</TE>

not for the reasons she suggests. Let's not forget that it was the
scandal-mongering Democrats--so bereft of ideas and ideals, praying
for an issue with which to hammer the Republicans--who initiated the
witch hunt. Unfortunately for them, when they kicked over Enron's
stinking carcass, the maggots they found underneath looked strangely
like Bill Clinton.</TE>

Lieberman (D-Conn.) want to continue to put nails in his own coffin?

<LD>Re "The Best Way to Bust Up L.A.," Opinion, June 9: The proposal of
former Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg to divide the city of Los
Angeles into nine boroughs is brilliant. The process of making many
of the decisions important to the local areas would be done very
close to the community of interest while other important
services--police and fire, for example--could be provided on a
citywide or regional basis. These services are best provided on a
regional level.</LD>
<LD>   There is no reason to break up Los Angeles if the borough system
can be implemented. The major question now is whether the politicians
downtown can look beyond their own partisan interests and vote to put
the proposal on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Reardon</LD>
<TE>   Fallbrook</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The opposite sides on the secession issue might be better served
if they switched their focus from, on the anti side, deploring the
possible breakup of a great city and, on the pro side, whining about
how they are ignored by that big, brutish, poorly run un-great city.
Joel Kotkin and Fred Siegel suggest a sensible path toward
conciliation, although they too can't resist calling L.A. a great
city--even comparing it to "other great cities" like London.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s supporters consistently argue that the city would not be
world class if it were broken up. But maybe both sides could be
appeased if each decided--together--to try to make L.A. into the city
that too many, now, can only assert it to be. A city with better
schools, responsive politicians, zoning that improves quality of
life, green space and concern for the average citizen that equals
that for the high-roller and the developer.</TE>
<TE>   I believe the borough system is a terrific step--albeit only a
step--in that direction. Living in Santa Monica, I have seen that
interested citizens can become involved in their government in a way
they cannot in the place that is the not-yet-world-class Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With all the heat surrounding secession, one intangible factor
remains unmentioned--pride in the place one lives. If the Valley
secedes, we will live in a city with no museums, no sports arenas, no
music center, no baseball stadium, no harbor, no beaches, no great
cathedrals or temples and no "cultural center" but Universal
CityWalk. (And maybe not even that.) All the great cities of the
world are made up of numerous, diverse neighborhoods, each offering
something unique to the whole. Los Angeles, as the second-largest
city in the U.S., is one of them. We have a history and a tradition
that goes way back, and if we destroy this entity, we destroy the
city's essential character.</TE>
<TE>   If secession is passed, those of us who live in the Valley can
take little pride in our new "hometown." We will have broken a major
American city and willed ourselves a pile of problems instead.</TE>

<TE>   If renters in Hollywood outnumber homeowners 3 to 1, and
homeowners pay property taxes, which segment of the population is
going to have more influence and power in a new Hollywood city?
Certainly not the majority population. Before voting, all L.A.
residents should read George Orwell's "Animal Farm." The secessionist
rhetoric will sound eerily familiar. (I just picked up a copy at the
Los Angeles Public Library.)</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Bacalski</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Am I the only person who is tired of reading about the proposed
secession of the Hollywood and Valley areas from the city of Los
Angeles? Frankly, if the proponents of these pornography- and
drug-selling-infested areas of L.A. had placed as much effort on the
cleanup of their own neighborhoods as they have on these breakaway
efforts, there might not be the need to secede.</TE>
<TE>   What makes them think they can run these proposed instant
"cup-of-soup" cities better than the current government? I doubt that
any of them has experience running a city on a daily basis. It's one
thing to be a disgruntled complainer; it's an entirely different
matter to run cities on a daily basis and provide the services that
an electorate dictates be provided.</TE>
<TE>   I am still not sure why Los Angeles would even want to keep these
undesirable areas within its own borders. If the voters in these
areas think they will be better off without the city of Los Angeles
and approve secession, I say to them, "Don't let the door hit you in
the rear on the way out."</TE>

<LD>Re "Ebony and Ivory Come Together in Eminem," Commentary, June 7:
Crispin Sartwell wrote a column rife with contradictions that smash
the stereotypes he himself draws from to make his point.</LD>
<LD>   Sartwell claims that rapper Eminem is some sort of embodiment of
real white culture. Perhaps it's just the generation I belong to, but
it is apparent that there is no white culture and there is no black
culture--at least not anymore. How else could white Eminem be
considered a commanding pioneer in a "black" art?</LD>
<LD>   It is time to move beyond the shallow defining of men by their
skin color or old-world roots. This is America--post-civil rights
movement.</LD>
<TE>   Besides, it should be an insult to anyone who could remotely be
considered "black" to have Eminem's immoral, childish and crass brand
of rap attributed to black culture. Has Sartwell unconsciously
subscribed to the trashy stereotypes that have been assigned to black
people in this country? He must have, if his definition of "black"
has anything to do with Eminem and his exploitative music. This
black-versus-white obsession is really getting old.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Under an "innocence project" started two years ago, Orange County
prosecutors and public defenders have reviewed the cases of 27
inmates who claim to be wrongly convicted but found that none deserve
new trials, according to results released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In two separate reviews, Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas joined a
defense attorney and law school professor to examine the cases, which
date to 1978. The cases were reviewed to determine whether testing or
retesting of DNA evidence could exonerate the defendants.</LD>
<LD>   The panel agreed unanimously that none of the cases warranted
further testing.</LD>
<TE>   Among those reviewed were the conviction of John Morse Otto,
sentenced to 130 years for kidnapping, raping and beating a
9-year-old girl who was abducted from her bed; Steven Craig Horkey,
sentenced to life in prison in 1978 for murder, attempted murder and
robbery; and Duke Kimberly Bolter, sentenced to 25 years to life in
1987 for killing a woman and taking her car. Bolter is also awaiting
trial on charges of killing a fellow inmate in Pelican Bay State
Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the project's results, prosecutors said they would
continue to review cases. "I don't see this project as ever ending,"
said DNA expert and Deputy Dist. Atty. Camille Hill, who sat on the
review panel. "I'd like to think that our office is always open to
reviewing any case where DNA testing can exonerate an inmate."</TE>
<TE>   Hill said one reason the nation has seen an increase in overturned
cases is because the science of DNA testing has advanced
tremendously.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County officials reviewed 38 cases. However, 11 were
rejected because they were not local cases. Fifteen others involved
evidence that was destroyed or did not exist.</TE>

<HD>Bank Heist Disrupts The Times</HD>
<DH>Crime: Robber leaves what is found to be a fake bomb.

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portions of the Los Angeles Times building were evacuated for several
hours Friday after a man who robbed a bank on the building's ground
floor left what appeared to be a pipe bomb as his calling card,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   All employees returned to the building about three hours later
after police bomb specialists used a remote-controlled robot to
detonate the phony bomb in the bank at the corner of 1st Street and
Broadway. There were no injuries during the robbery or detonation.</LD>
<LD>   The lone robber, described by police as a 5-foot-3 Latino 35 to 40
years old, entered the Bank of America branch about 12:15 p.m. posing
as a customer, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Jim Grayson.</LD>
<TE>   The man presented a teller with an envelope that contained a note
demanding money, Grayson said.</TE>
<TE>   On the counter the robber placed a small blue cloth bag, which was
opened enough to reveal a long metal pipe connected by several wires
to a small watch that was strapped to the device, the lieutenant
said.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect fled with a handful of cash but not the blue bag,
Grayson said, adding:</TE>
<TE>   "He told the teller: 'I'm going to leave you a little something.'
"</TE>
<TE>   The robber was last seen fleeing on foot along Broadway. Police
blocked traffic around the building for several blocks until the
device was detonated.</TE>
<TE>   Grayson said that bombs are rarely used in bank robberies.</TE>

<HD>Sale of A-Bomb Devices Is OKd</HD>
<DH>Memorabilia: Judge rejects contention that parts from
'Little Boy,' dropped on Hiroshima, are classified material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday morning brushed aside the government's attempt
to invalidate the auction of two devices that helped detonate the
first atomic bomb, saying the military had not proved that the
artifacts are classified material.</LD>
<LD>   Government attorneys had initially sought a restraining order to
block last Tuesday's auction, then seemed to hedge their bets by
asking for more time Friday.</LD>
<LD>   At a brief court hearing, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston denied
the government's case on both counts--declining to give the military
time to investigate the plugs by taking them apart and ordering that
the sale, which had been on hold, be completed immediately.</LD>
<TE>   The judge said the dispute over the thumb-sized artifacts--two of
the last remnants of an event that hastened the end of World War II
and ushered in the Nuclear Age--was "not a national security issue."</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego-area retiree who bought the devices was ebullient as
he walked from the federal courthouse to the offices of Butterfields
Auctioneers to pick up his purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Clay Perkins, a Rancho Santa Fe resident and former General
Dynamics rocket scientist, said he was inspired to become a physicist
in part because of the atomic bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins and the auction house had argued that the devices were
personal keepsakes, not government property--and, more important,
that their technology is little more sophisticated than that of many
household appliances. Similar devices have even been on display at
museums.</TE>
<TE>   "One always believes a judge is wise if she agrees with you. And,
of course, that's what happened," Perkins said. "But we thought it
was clear. It was absolutely the right decision."</TE>
<TE>   The government could press its case, because Friday's ruling was
technically only on the request for a restraining order, not on the
broader debate over the propriety of selling the devices.</TE>
<TE>   But government attorneys declined to say whether they would take
additional steps to try to gain control of the plugs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the plugs were on a plane with their new owner, headed
home. They will be displayed, Perkins said, alongside a collection of
military memorabilia, including a 16th century cannon lifted from a
Spanish ship.</TE>
<TE>   Butterfields spokeswoman Monique Crine said only that "we're
pleased with the results."</TE>
<TE>   The devices were part of "Little Boy," the bomb the United States
dropped Aug. 6, 1945, on Hiroshima, killing an estimated 80,000
people instantly and leaving a radiation cloud that eventually killed
tens of thousands more.</TE>
<TE>   Along with a second bomb, dropped later on Nagasaki, the attacks
forced Japan to surrender and effectively ended World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Morris Jeppson, a weapons tester and a member of the Enola Gay
crew that dropped the bomb, grabbed the two devices at the end of the
mission and took them home. One is a green switch that defused the
bomb until it was ready to be dropped, and the second was a red
switch that completed the bomb's circuitry and allowed it to explode.</TE>
<TE>   The devices were sold as part of a larger military memorabilia
sale organized by Butterfields. Perkins bought the plugs for
$167,500, most of which will go to Jeppson, now a Las Vegas retiree.</TE>

<HD>Bridge Project Finally Underway</HD>
<DH>Transit: A $112-million expansion of the Ventura Freeway
over the Santa Clara River will ease traffic between Oxnard and
Ventura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of anticipation, officials broke ground Friday on a
$112-million project to rebuild and double the width of the aging
Santa Clara River Bridge, the largest road project in recent Ventura
County history.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion aims to eliminate the chronic bottleneck between
Oxnard and Ventura along the Ventura Freeway. It is scheduled for
completion in 2006, although nesting birds, steelhead trout and the
complexity of the project may test that timetable.</LD>
<LD>   The new bridge will boast 12 lanes instead of six and will include
a bicycle lane connecting area paths. The highway on both ends of the
bridge, from Vineyard Avenue to Johnson Drive, also will be widened.</LD>
<TE>   And the left-lane entrance onto the northbound freeway from the
Pacific Coast Highway will be replaced with an overpass.</TE>
<TE>   The overall widening will allow Oxnard to proceed with its
RiverPark development, a mini-city of 2,800 homes with business
space, schools, parks and a convention center that could power the
city's economy for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "This will begin a new era, enable us to complete the dreams we've
had for many years," said Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, who joined 75
local and transportation officials gathered with shovels at the
river's edge to turn the soil and celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   While the end result may be less congestion, the next four years
could try the patience of the more than 150,000 commuters who travel
the route each day.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Kathy Long urged commuters to look for alternate
routes on Fridays and Sundays, when weekend travelers from Los
Angeles to Santa Barbara clog the freeway. She called on area
employers to show tolerance if workers are late or want to adjust
their schedules to off-hours. And she asked area residents to be
patient with road crews as they build the new bridge around the
existing one.</TE>
<TE>   It could be months before any bridge work is noticeable. Workers
will begin by building three new northbound lanes alongside the
existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   Northbound traffic then will shift to the new lanes and southbound
traffic will shift to the old northbound lanes. Then the old
southbound span will be demolished and a six-lane span erected.
Southbound traffic will then shift to the new southbound span.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the old northbound span will be demolished, a new one
built, and two center shoulders added to fill in the middle. The
bridge is about one-third of a mile long, and the total construction
area is two miles long.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Long called for "a mantra of patience," adding, "The
end goal will be worth the wait."</TE>
<TE>   Project officials hope to keep chaos to a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   They will use tall screens to keep workers out of sight so
drivers' eyes remain on the road, said engineer Dragan Buha. Any road
closures will be at night and alternate routes will be publicized
through local media outlets and a Web site that is not yet set up.</TE>
<TE>   Although lanes may move around, there won't be any fewer lanes
throughout the duration of the project than there are now. A truck
providing tow service will roam the construction area, plucking
crashed or broken-down vehicles out of the way as quickly as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Still, drivers should prepare for delays, narrower lanes,
nighttime road closures and general confusion on the part of other
motorists during the next four years.</TE>
<TE>   The push for improvements began two decades ago, and the time in
between has been marked by frustration and controversy as sleepy
beach and farm towns sprouted new housing tracts, business parks and
shopping centers, and traffic grew. Oxnard and Ventura wrangled for
years, through lawyers, about what sort of housing and commercial
growth could be handled given the already-crowded bridge's
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the bridge is so worn--its southbound lanes were built in
1932--that transportation officials have attached structural
monitoring devices to warn should a storm threaten its stability.</TE>
<TE>   Crews began limited work on the expansion weeks ago, and in the
coming weeks workers will concentrate on the median area south of the
bridge.</TE>
<TE>   It could be months, however, before the project picks up steam.
Structural work in the riverbed must be done before bridge expansion
can begin. Birds living under the bridge have led state Fish and Game
Department officials to ban most structural work until mid-September,
when nesting season ends. Much structural work also will be off
limits during the wet season from November until April, because when
the river rises, it is considered a habitat for protected steelhead
trout.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these limitations, transportation officials maintain that
they can complete the project on time.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor John Flynn, a Ventura County native, said the massive
project is a reality check for people still telling themselves that
they are insulated from the troubles of metropolitan Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "People keep saying, 'We don't want to be like Orange County or
the San Fernando Valley,' " he said. "But once it's built, we're
urban.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't pretend we don't need it, though," Flynn said. "I know we
need it."</TE>

<LD>A judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against Monterey Park Mayor
Fred Balderrama by a City Council member who sought the mayor's
removal because of an alleged conflict of interest in the selection
of a bus contractor.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena Superior Court Judge Coleman A. Swart ruled this week
that allegations that Balderrama violated state law could not be
tried in civil court.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Frank Venti sued the mayor, the city and the contractor
in January, charging that Balderrama influenced the awarding of the
$1.5-million contract to Parking Concepts Inc., whose owner he works
for. Balderrama maintains there was no impropriety because he recused
himself from the selection process.</LD>

<LD>A Los Angeles federal judge sentenced a businessman to 18 months in
prison Friday for taking part in a scheme to sink a $1.9-million
yacht off the coast of Italy to collect on a $3.5-million insurance
policy.</LD>
<LD>   The sentence represents time previously served by Paul A. Ebeling,
62, of St. Louis after he was indicted on 13 criminal counts,
including conspiracy, fraud and perjury.</LD>
<LD>   Ebeling was given a reduced sentence for cooperating with the
government and testifying against the plot's mastermind, Rex
DeGeorge, 65, a former Beverly Hills lawyer who was convicted in
March and faces sentencing Tuesday.</LD>

<HD>El Segundo Project Goes to the Voters</HD>
<DH>Development: Residents group opposes office- hotel-retail
plan, which city approved in January.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposed multimillion-dollar development in El Segundo will go
before voters Tuesday, potentially ending an expensive and bitter
campaign between two large companies over an empty plot of land in
the city's northeast corner.</LD>
<LD>   The El Segundo Corporate Campus project calls for about 1.6
million square feet of office space, with hotel, retail and
restaurant development on land next to Nash Street near the Century
Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the deal Thomas Properties Group, the project's
developer, would give the city land for a new fire station and the
option to buy six acres for playing fields at a reduced cost.</LD>
<TE>   City leaders approved the plan in January, saying it would create
thousands of jobs and allow the city to purchase the land for playing
fields at a good price.</TE>
<TE>   But a group of residents known as Citizens Against Gridlock in El
Segundo gathered enough signatures in March to force a special
election. Voters will be asked whether the city should be required to
stop the project.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also sued the city, saying it failed to perform a
required traffic plan before approving the development.</TE>
<TE>   They say that the project will attract too much traffic to the
city and that the new fields, located in a heavily trafficked area,
will be too dangerous for children to reach. They also think the
fields are too close to toxic industrial residue.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the project say traffic effects can be lessened and
that experts have determined that there is no environmental danger.</TE>
<TE>   "When this is done, it'll be a very good project," said Mayor Mike
Gordon. "This is just a great deal for us."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Crowley, chairman of Citizens Against Gridlock, disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   He says that under the current plan, Thomas Properties will not
pay the city enough for traffic measures and that some language in
the plan's fine print makes the project financially questionable for
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate cheating, but when the teacher actually looks the other
way when the student is cheating--well, that ticks me off even more,"
Crowley said. "Thomas is a salesman, and the city is giving them
everything they want."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials have accused Kilroy Realty, which owns several
office buildings around the proposed development area, of creating a
public outcry in order to protect its business interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't work for Kilroy," Crowley said. "I work with them. It is
my fight. It's my property value that's going to be knocked down."</TE>
<TE>   Kilroy has spent about $330,000 to help Citizens Against Gridlock
in its fight against Thomas Properties, Crowley said.</TE>
<TE>   Kilroy officials say they are concerned that the traffic measures
will be inadequate and by language in the plan that would allow the
area to be used for industrial purposes. They are not trying to
stifle competition, said Hugh Greenup, executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the immediately adjacent landowners and are entitled to be
involved in the city's review of the project," he said. "It's
entirely fair that we participate in the process."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Properties officials, who have spent about $400,000 on
advertising and other costs related to this campaign since January,
said they are offering the city more than enough money to offset
traffic problems. And although the area's zoning allows for some
light industrial use in parts of the project area, the development is
mostly for high-tech tenants, not factories and smokestacks, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are using the industrial argument because it brings fear to
the people of El Segundo," said Tom Ricci, senior vice president of
Thomas Properties.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said he is confident that voters will approve the project.
But even if they do, Thomas Properties cannot move forward until the
lawsuit is settled.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the community sees right through this for what it is,"
Gordon said of the opposition campaign, which he added "is not a
movement of the people of El Segundo."</TE>
<TE>   Crowley is "cautiously optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a battle of the titans," he said. "The mayor's
created an emotional issue, when mainly it should be a cold business
deal."</TE>

<HD>Injunction Holds Up ZEV Program</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge's action in suit against California by auto
makers could delay the arrival of more low-emissions vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC and JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has temporarily blocked California from moving ahead
with plans to introduce advanced technology cars, throwing the
state's electric vehicle program into turmoil at the moment auto
makers are poised to mass produce the cleaner machines.</LD>
<LD>   While the U.S. district court decision leaves intact the state's
zero emissions vehicle mandate, it sets aside key amendments that air
quality officials approved last year.</LD>
<LD>   Those amendments granted the auto industry wide flexibility in
choosing what type of cars to build. The amendments favored hybrid
vehicles, fuel-cell engines and super-clean gasoline models over
battery-powered cars.</LD>
<TE>   However, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler sued California to
overturn the amendments, and the entire so-called ZEV program,
contending the Air Resources Board overstepped its authority in
approving revisions to the 12-year-old program. In a ruling announced
Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle issued a temporary
injunction until the lawsuit is decided, which could take many
months.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not throw out the ZEV mandate, but we can no longer
provide the same level of options and flexibility," said Michael P.
Kenny, the ARB's executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the ruling may be a pyrrhic victory for auto companies
because it apparently leaves intact an older, more stringent version
of the regulation, which requires 4% of all new cars sold in
California to emit no tailpipe exhaust. That standard is the most
stringent in the world, but it canonly be met using battery power,
which auto makers and state air quality officials acknowledge is not
yet ready for prime time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic that the ARB has bent over backward to provide
flexibility the auto companies asked for, and what do they get? Auto
makers suing them over the option that grants them additional
flexibility," said Roland Hwang, senior policy analyst at the Natural
Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruling comes at a particularly sensitive time in the
program as auto makers are required to roll out thousands of low- or
non-polluting cars as early as next year. With the new model year
months away, a trickle of clean machines is taking to the road,
including hybrids such as the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic and
Insight, as well as smaller electric cars like GEM by DaimlerChrysler
and Think from Ford. How many more will follow and how soon they
arrive is now uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   GM spokesman Donn Walker said the company was pleased with the
judge's decision and will spend the coming weeks determining the
company's next step.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always believed this to be a long, drawn-out legal battle
and we still believe that to be the case. We always thought we had a
strong legal argument, and I believe it got a lot stronger today.
We're very pleased," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   California and auto makers in Japan and Detroit have been at odds
over the ZEV program since it was launched more than a decade ago.
Because of the state's severe smog, California is the only state
allowed under the Clean Air Act to regulate tailpipe exhaust. That
authority has led to the nation's most stringent controls on cars and
light trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with so many cars on the road today, air quality officials say
smoggy regions such as Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley have
little chance of reaching smog standards without a quantum leap
toward non-polluting vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Coyle's ruling, signed Tuesday and released Thursday,
provides regulators and auto makers a powerful new incentive to
settle on yet another approach to the beleaguered ZEV program.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers vigorously oppose a requirement for mass production of
full-size electric cars because they fear consumers will be turned
off by the costs and limitations of battery technology. Yet, the
older version of the rule the ARB may now pursue requires just that.</TE>

<HD>Isadore Familian, 90; Philanthropist, Jewish Community
Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Isadore Familian, a Los Angeles industrialist, philanthropist and
Jewish community leader who provided decades of support--and inspired
others to do likewise--for the University of Judaism and the City of
Hope, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Familian died of natural causes Thursday at his home in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Chicago to Russian immigrant parents, Familian arrived in
Los Angeles in 1913, when he was 2. As a boy, he worked in his
father's junk business after school.</LD>
<TE>   When the family went into the plumbing supply business, the
teenage Familian proved to be an adept salesman and dropped out of
Roosevelt High School at 16 to work full time for Familian Pipe and
Supply Co.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, he became a partner in the family business, at a time
when it was nearly half a million dollars in the red. But the family
eventually bought Price Pfister Brass Manufacturing Co., and
Familian's father, David, put him in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Under Familian's leadership, the plant expanded from 50 employees
to 1,500 and became one of the largest manufacturers of brass bath
and kitchen hardware in the world. In 1969, Price Pfister became a
subsidiary of Norris Industries and Familian continued as chairman of
the board.</TE>
<TE>   Familian, family members said, viewed his success in business as
the platform for his philanthropic activities.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1947 founding of the University of Judaism in Hollywood,
Familian served on its board of directors and various committees. In
the 1970s, he spearheaded a fund-raising campaign to build the
university's 28-acre campus on Mulholland Drive, which is named for
Familian and his first wife, Sunny, who died in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an outstanding fund-raiser, first of all because of his
own generosity," said David Lieber, president emeritus of the
university, "and, second, because he was such an attractive
personality. He was a very charismatic person."</TE>
<TE>   "He was perhaps the brightest, most articulate person I have ever
met," said David Marmel, a member of the board of regents for the
City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, whose Children's and
Bone Marrow Transplantation Center is also named in honor of Familian
and his first wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I have listened to Isadore Familian speak, in the 35 years I knew
him, maybe 300 times, and I always learned something. A man like
Isadore Familian comes once in a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Marmel said that Familian, who served on the City of Hope's board
of directors, "gave millions, and he raised countless many more
millions" for the medical center.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Marmel said, Familian's passions were "his family, his
friends and raising funds."</TE>
<TE>   "In this community, in a positive sense, he was the Godfather,"
said Marmel, noting that "if Isadore Familian would call you, one
would be reluctant to pick up the phone, and God forbid he asked you
to have lunch, because you knew what that meant."</TE>
<TE>   In recognition of his fund-raising efforts and more than 60 years
of service, the City of Hope last fall announced that a street at the
sprawling medical center would be renamed "Isadore Familian Way," the
first such honor in the City of Hope's 88-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Familian was a founding board member of City
National Bank, served on the board of the Los Angeles Music Center
Operating Co., chaired the United Jewish Welfare Fund drive for
Greater Los Angeles, served as a board member of the Jewish Community
Foundation and was involved with the United Crusade and the March of
Dimes.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are fortunate enough to acquire any kind of wealth,
some of this should go back to the community, not in death but in a
lifetime," Familian told The Times in 1971. "We are not here to make
money."</TE>
<TE>   Familian's philanthropic model was his father, who was involved
with the City of Hope as early as 1917.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1940s, Familian and his brother, George, financed the
construction of a chapel named in their father's honor at Adat Ari El
in Valley Village, the oldest synagogue in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "My father," Familian once recalled, "had a tremendous compassion
for people. His philosophy was based on the Jewish religion, and even
though his earnings were often meager, if someone needed a dollar,
you could always depend on David.</TE>
<TE>   "My father once told me the perfect balance of time was 25% for
the family life and 25% for business. But we never attain the
relaxing life because the community takes 50% of the time. But we are
very pleased that this has occurred, because we take the position
that life becomes fuller if you give more."</TE>
<TE>   Familian is survived by his wife, Shirley; daughter Sondra Smalley
of Los Angeles; son Gary Familian of Monterey; stepchildren Edie
Bronson of Beverly Hills and Richard Baskin of Santa Monica; nine
grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at Hillside
Memorial Park, 6001 W. Centinela Ave., Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Deputies Kill Man After 5 Workers Are Hurt</HD>
<DH>Crime: Assailant is shot to death in parking lot after
rampage at a chemical company in San Dimas. Three people suffered
burns and two others were stabbed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 30-year-old man went on a rampage Friday at a chemical research
company in San Dimas, burning or stabbing at five co-workers before
sheriff's deputies shot him to death in the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters received a call about an explosion and fire at 1:53
p.m. at the Maxdem facility on Arrow Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Two people were critically burned and a third suffered
first-degree burns, said Dennis Cross, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles County Fire Department.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, a man and woman at the company were taken to
hospitals in critical condition with stab wounds. One was stabbed in
the head and neck, the other in the abdomen, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees were fleeing the building as firefighters arrived, Cross
said, and only some smoke and flames remained.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Nassar, 25, who works at his family's Arco gas station
across the street, said he saw the attacker, whose name has not been
released, chase a man outside the building, then throw a bottle on
the ground. Instantly, the other man's leg caught fire and he ran to
a Texaco station next door to Maxdem as he tried to extinguish the
flames, said Nassar, who called 911.</TE>
<TE>   Nassar and his brother, Raymond, 21, said the man who threw the
bottle went back into the building. Soon, another man ran outside
bleeding profusely from a badly cut ear and yelling, "Some guy's
going crazy in there," Raymond Nassar said.</TE>
<TE>   When sheriff's deputies arrived, another person was running from
the building entrance, followed by the attacker, and screaming,
"That's him! That's him!" Raymond Nassar said. Deputies fired five or
six shots at the man, who was holding something that looked like a
canister, Raymond Nassar said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Rick Varela said two fires
had been ignited in the building "as a result of chemicals being
dispersed."</TE>
<TE>   San Dimas Mayor Curt Morris, who went to the scene, said a Maxdem
employee told him the man was a chemist with a Jordanian passport.</TE>
<TE>   "He had recently, like last September, gotten a PhD in chemistry,"
Morris said. "He had recently gone on a trip back to Jordan and
gotten engaged."</TE>
<TE>   Morris said the employee told him there was no sign of trouble
with the man in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Maxdem is a high-tech manufacturer of super-rigid plastics. Some
of its work has involved contracts from the Pentagon's Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, which directs U.S. research and
development of antimissile technology. The sheriff's bomb squad sent
a robot to examine the attacker's car, fearing it might be
booby-trapped. The squad set off a charge that shattered the car's
windows. A detective then inspected the car before the squad set off
another charge.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Bilking of USC Charity</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Arcadia man who established a foundation that he promised would
give $2.5 million to USC's Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center was
arrested by federal agents Friday on charges of embezzling donations
intended for the facility.</LD>
<LD>   David Frederick Thornton, 36, also was charged with carrying out
other scams in which he allegedly posed as a doctor, a diplomat, an
FBI agent and a CIA operative.</LD>
<LD>   He was being held without bail on charges of embezzlement, wire
fraud, credit card fraud, check fraud and impersonating federal
officers.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office provided only sketchy details of the
case against Thornton.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Curtis A. Kin said Thornton embezzled more
than $147,000 in donations that were supposed to have been funneled
to the Norris center through his Thornton Kidney Research Foundation,
which he founded in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton continued to solicit money for the Norris center,
pocketing the proceeds, after USC severed its relationship with him
in 1998, Kin said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Norris center could not be reached for comment
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1990 profile in The Times, Thornton spoke about his gratitude
to doctors at the center for having diagnosed his rare kidney
disease.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had received conflicting diagnoses from 26 physicians
before doctors at the USC facility correctly diagnosed his illness
and removed one of his kidneys.</TE>
<TE>   Then 24, Thornton said he wanted to show his appreciation by
raising $2.5 million to endow a research suite and a professorship at
the Norris center. Kin said Thornton raised only a fraction of the
money he promised. He declined to reveal how much cash the Norris
center actually received.</TE>
<TE>   In the other alleged scams, Kin said Thornton conned friends and
family members into investing in bogus business dealings that he
claimed to have with the Nigerian government.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton also was accused of trying to cash a counterfeit
$25-million check supposedly issued by Union Bank of Nigeria to his
kidney research foundation.</TE>
<TE>   His arrest grew out of an investigation by the Secret Service's
international fraud task force with help from the Arcadia and
Pasadena police departments.</TE>

<HD>Prostitution Alleged at Norco Golf Tournament</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities on Friday raided a private golf tournament in Norco at
which prostitutes allegedly were selling their services on the
fairways.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 people were detained for questioning by Riverside
County sheriff's deputies after undercover investigators saw sex
taking place at the Hidden Valley Golf Club, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Among the detainees were 10 to 15 women, as well as employees and
golfers, said sheriff's spokeswoman Shelley Kennedy-Smith.</LD>
<TE>   By 9 p.m., half of those detained had been released.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests had yet been made, but more than 40 people were still
being questioned, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they believe golfers had sex with prostitutes
at the club at least once before. Authorities have been watching
Hidden Valley for about three weeks, they said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the club was reserved for a private tournament and
several tents were pitched on the course. Smith said investigators
observed sex between golfers and women in plain sight on the
fairways.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the course, golf was being played, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives don't yet know if someone hired the prostitutes or the
women "just came out and acted alone."</TE>
<TE>   "How long this has been going on we're not sure," Smith said. "We
know, based on leads, that this has occurred on at least one other
occasion."</TE>
<TE>   No one at the golf club could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's terrible," said Barbara Carmichael, a councilwoman
in Norco, which is about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I told [officials] to say it was in Corona," she joked.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most flabbergasted were members of the Norco Kiwanis
Club, a public-service organization that meets Friday mornings at
Hidden Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife said no more Kiwanis meetings at the club," said Dale
Borgen, the group's president-elect.</TE>
<TE>   Borgen said he did not see any scantily clad women, but he did
notice that the club was surprisingly empty for a Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a shock to me," he said. "Next week's meeting ought to be
interesting."</TE>

<HD>For Simon, Naughty or Nice Race?</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate for governor is facing pressure to
follow Davis' lead and go on attack. He's reportedly balked at some
assertive strategies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After engineering an upset in the March primary, strategists for
California gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. are once again
defying convention--this time by doing nothing.</LD>
<LD>   For the last 11 days, Gov. Gray Davis has been alone on the
television airwaves, most of that time assailing Republican Simon in
a spot blaming his mismanagement for the taxpayer bailout of a failed
savings and loan. It is the sort of first strike that Davis, a
Democrat, used to devastating effect last winter, when his attack
advertising helped topple Richard Riordan and nudge Simon to his
longshot victory.</LD>
<LD>   It is also the sort of assault that typically summons an immediate
response, on the widely held theory that any attack that goes
unanswered will inevitably stay fixed in the minds of voters.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the Simon camp is preparing to air its own television
advertising, perhaps as early as next week. But the lag between
attack and response has stirred further consternation in Republican
circles, where many fault Simon for getting off to a slow and
stumbling start after his March victory. It also points to a split in
the GOP--and within Simon's ranks--over strategy and, specifically,
how aggressive the challenger should be in attacking the Democratic
incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   On one side are friends, family members and Simon's top campaign
advisors, who believe that one of the candidate's strongest assets is
his image as a congenial conservative. The Republican hopeful "has a
manner that people like ... and we have no intention of ruining it,"
said Jeff Flint, a Simon advisor. But many of the Republican Party's
most-practiced strategists, and a handful of advisors inside the
Simon camp, believe the candidate has been too passive and are trying
to coax him, against his nature, to hit Davis harder.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't be the schoolmarm in this campaign," said Ken
Khachigian, a veteran GOP strategist who is not affiliated with the
Simon effort. "He's up against a tough, ruthless, consummately
focused organization that will put their foot on his throat and never
let up. So this is not the time to be a choirboy."</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters, the wrangling comes as Simon has
begun reaching out to women and environmentalists by vowing to uphold
legalized abortion, push for a permanent California ban on offshore
oil drilling and support a $1-billion park bond measure. The steps
are intended to broaden his political appeal--registered Democrats
outnumber Republicans by roughly 1.5 million voters in California.
But the moves have been noted with unhappiness by some activists, who
say they conflict with the Simon who billed himself as the one true
conservative in the GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   Be Yourself, Some Say</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon should look at the pages of those who either won or
came close and can live with themselves because they didn't adapt or
change," said John Gizzi, political editor of Human Events, a
Washington journal of conservative opinion. "[George] Deukmejian
comes to mind. [Ronald] Reagan.... Those who are themselves instead
of trying to be something they are not are usually more successful in
politics."</TE>
<TE>   Flint brushed aside concerns about eroding conservative support.
"There's nothing like defeating Gray Davis to excite the base," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the tensions the Republican nominee faces are inherent in
any campaign when the candidate shifts from the primary, where
appeals are generally aimed at the party's hardest-core supporters,
to the wider audience of a general election. It is a pivot that is
difficult for even the most deft politician, let alone a first-time
candidate like Simon. For him, aides say, every day has been an
education in the realities of campaign rough-and-tumble.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has struggled to balance his personal instincts with those
of political strategists pressing him to more aggressively attack
Davis. Two of his newest  advisors, Sean Walsh and Rob Lapsley,
worked in the primary for Secretary of State Bill Jones, one of the
more pugnacious of the Republican contestants.</TE>
<TE>   According to inside accounts, Simon privately has lashed out
against those he felt were pushing him too hard to campaign in the
Jones mode.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill is much more comfortable talking about governing," said Sal
Russo, Simon's top strategist and the architect of his primary win.
He likened Simon to candidates such as Jack Kemp and Reagan, urging
him to emulate their sunnier approach to politics.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of his advisors' conflicting impulses, Simon has often
been slow to respond to events. The Oracle contracting scandal was
front-page news for days before Simon seized upon the affair, which
has since become a focus of his assault on the governor and his
aggressive fund-raising tactics. After Davis' television attack hit
the airwaves late last week, Simon aides bickered in a nasty series
of e-mails over how--and whether--to react. The argument continued
for days.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, who is paid by the state Republican Party to advise the
Simon campaign, minimized the differences among strategists. "There
really is no fight among people in-house about what to do and how to
get there," he said. "It's just about tone, degree and timing."</TE>
<TE>   Since winning the primary, Simon has issued a steady stream of
attacks on Davis, in a near-daily flurry of press releases and
campaign appearances throughout the state. But those speak mostly to
a small audience of political insiders. Communicating with voters
requires an investment of millions of dollars in sustained TV
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Response Criticized</TE>
<TE>   To outside critics, the willingness to cede the television
airwaves is symptomatic of a campaign that has been too slow to seize
the initiative and too soft in going after the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis is a terrible governor. He presents an incredibly big
target," said one Republican Party strategist, speaking anonymously
from Washington. "People want to see [Simon] strip the bark off
Davis. But for some reason, the Simon campaign seems to be reluctant
to go after him."</TE>
<TE>   Russo and other Simon strategists insist, however, that there are
good tactical reasons for staying off the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, they believe the Davis ads will fail to sway
voters. They said the incumbent's low standing in popularity polls
reflects a lack of credibility with voters; no one will believe the
good things he says about himself or the bad things he says about
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "It does take away some of the urgency" of responding, Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   Another unspoken consideration is the huge money gap between the
two campaigns. Simon, who has shown little eagerness to dip into his
personal fortune to finance his campaign, is expected to be outspent
by Davis by $10 million or more between now and election day. If
Davis' ads are truly ineffectual--and it is too soon to tell--that
would be all the more reason for the Simon campaign to husband its
resources. "To those who say you have to respond, I would say that's
correct, you do," Russo said. "And we intend to. But we're going to
respond in the appropriate fashion."</TE>
<TE>   As for all the second-guessing, "Are any of these people the one
who said Simon would win the primary?" Russo scoffed. "Or are these
the people who said Simon had no chance and Riordan is a cinch?"</TE>

<HD>College Proposes Soaring Venture</HD>
<DH>Building: Irvine Valley seeks investors in office, theater
plan thought to be unprecedented in state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine Valley College officials are quietly trying to find investors
for a private hotel, entertainment and office complex on campus that
could cost as much as $800 million, officials confirmed this week.</LD>
<LD>   As described in recent meetings among campus officials, the
project would include a hotel, a multistory parking structure, two
2,000-seat theaters, office buildings, a sound stage and a lake,
replacing orange groves and an athletic field at the southern end of
campus.</LD>
<LD>   The scope of the privately funded, for-profit project--whose cost
estimates nearly double Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles--is
believed to be unprecedented, not only for a community college, but
for any public university in the state.</LD>
<TE>   The cost would be enough to build two community colleges, said
Kirsten McIntyre, spokeswoman for the California Community Colleges
Chancellor's Office, which was unaware of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The project is a long way from reality and would have to be
approved by trustees for the South Orange County Community College
District, which includes Irvine Valley and Saddleback colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Some faculty and college employees say they don't understand how
the two-year college benefits from such a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a commercial enterprise that would not be a benefit
to our students," said Jan Wyma, Irvine Valley's choral director.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is being developed by Howard Gensler, Irvine Valley's
dean of humanities and library sciences, who declined to comment.
Raghu P. Mather, chancellor of the South Orange County Community
College District, said he had discussed the idea with the president
of the board of trustees, but would offer no details about the
project or how much revenue it would generate for the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn R. Roquemore, Irvine Valley's interim president, said he has
had informal conversations with Gensler about the project. "I can't
say whether I endorse it or oppose it," he said. "I have not received
a proposal."</TE>
<TE>   Although the size of the project is unusual, other colleges and
universities lease land to private businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton leased 3.15 acres for a six-story Marriott
hotel that was completed in 1989, the first commercial hotel on a
public campus in the state.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's Mission College receives $3 million a year for land it
leases to Cisco Systems and to movie theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Wyma and other Irvine Valley faculty members said they don't need
two 2,000-seat theaters, which campus sources say would be used for
commercial roadshows. Instead, Wyma said, they need a 300- to
400-seat theater for college concerts and plays.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the college is gearing up for a fund-raising campaign for
a 400-seat performing arts center, which includes faculty offices and
laboratory space. It is expected to cost $12.1 million and be
completed in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Cost Estimates Vary</TE>
<TE>   Gensler has discussed costs in the range of $500 million to $800
million, say campus officials familiar with the discussions. Donald
Wagner, president of the board of trustees, said he's heard a much
lower cost estimate, but declined to give a figure. He and Roquemore
said the plan does not include spending college money.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the project were provided by people who attended
meetings at which Gensler discussed his idea and by others who had
talked with him about it. Most spoke on condition of anonymity,
saying they feared retribution from administrators. They said Gensler
advised them not to discuss the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal has changed over the months, but the basic plan calls
for construction on 25 to 35 acres at Jeffrey Road and Barranca
Parkway.</TE>
<TE>   Several sources said Gensler was pitching the deal to investors as
a 99-year lease, and that it would include a Hilton or Hyatt hotel
with conference center facilities, restaurants, a four- or five-story
parking structure, an office building of several stories, the
theaters, an art museum, an observatory and a building with sound
stages for TV and film.</TE>
<TE>   Also contemplated are a movie complex and soccer stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Must OK Plan</TE>
<TE>   Any construction not associated with the college's educational
mission must be approved by Irvine, said Sheri Vander Dussen, the
city's director of community development. She said she had not heard
of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Theaters of the size of those in the project depend mostly on
touring productions to fill their calendar, and often do not make a
profit from ticket sales.The Orange County Performing Arts Center in
Costa Mesa, for example, operates the nearly 3,000-seat Segerstrom
Hall, along with Founders Hall, which can seat as many as 250 people.</TE>
<TE>   About 75% of the center's income comes from ticket sales, not
enough to cover operations, said Tim Dunn, public relations director.</TE>
<TE>   The gap is made up by donations and grants.</TE>
<TE>   The center is in the middle of a $200-million fund-raising
campaign to build a 2,000-seat symphonic music hall and a 500-seat
auditorium.</TE>

<HD>County Adds 1,000 Jobs During May</HD>
<DH>Economy: The growth comes mostly in nonfarm sectors and
helps the unemployment rate fall to 4.2% from 4.5% in April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a tepid national recovery, Ventura County's strong economic
rebound continued last month with record-setting job gains and
declining unemployment.</LD>
<LD>   "The Ventura County economy is amazing," said Bill Watkins,
director of the Economic Forecast Project at UC Santa Barbara. "It's
just a real job machine."</LD>
<LD>   A gain of 1,000 jobs, mostly in construction and manufacturing,
pushed county employment to 308,500 in May, the highest in history.
It also drove local joblessness down to 4.2%, compared with 4.5% in
April and January's peak of 5.5%.</LD>
<TE>   By comparison, California's unemployment rate in May was 5.9%, and
the U.S. rate was 5.5%, without seasonal adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County's location between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles
puts it in a prime spot," Watkins said. "And the growth of its
high-tech and biotech sectors means it's likely to continue to do
well."</TE>
<TE>   The number of county residents employed here and in other counties
also rose in May, to 405,800, the second-highest in history. That
trails only July 2001, when there were 300 more workers living here.</TE>
<TE>   Besides suggesting the overall strength of a balanced economy, the
May figures showed the county had rebounded completely from a
slowdown that brought two straight months of job losses early this
year. About 8,500 jobs have been added since January.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike the previous three months, when most job gains were due
to an expanded strawberry harvest, the May momentum came in nonfarm
sectors.</TE>
<TE>   While farm jobs remained steady last month, nonfarm employment
increased by 400 jobs in both construction and manufacturing and 200
positions in retail trades and services.</TE>
<TE>   The 4.2% May jobless rate compares with 3.4% a year ago, just as
the recession hit and before the Sept. 11 attacks sent the economy
into a tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   Still, employment last month increased by 800 jobs from May 2001,
thanks partly to a jump of 700 positions in finance, insurance and
real estate.</TE>
<TE>   That reflects bustling business at home mortgage firms as low
interest rates and a dwelling shortage fueled one of the strongest
housing booms in county history.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of that job gain is Countrywide [Home Loans]," Watkins said.
"That company is just creating an awful lot of jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Countrywide added 1,578 jobs to its Simi Valley operation last
year, leading all local businesses. Biotech giant Amgen added 931,
Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy and Ventura County government are the biggest local
employers, with 17,000 and 8,000 workers, respectively. Amgen has
about 5,400 local workers and Countrywide has 4,668, ranking third
and fourth overall, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's unemployment rate was tied for 11th-best of 58
counties in the state, and on par with Southern California, which has
weathered the recession far better than the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo County had the state's lowest jobless rate, 2.6%.
Of the large counties, only Orange and San Diego had lower rates than
Ventura's, at 3.6% and 3.7%, respectively. Los Angeles County had a
6.5% rate, unchanged from April.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, in a presentation to the Ventura Chamber of Commerce on
Friday, noted the county's economic strength. But he said business
leaders need to build more high-quality office buildings to draw more
well-paying jobs to the west county.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very wealthy community that lives here but drives
somewhere else to work," he said in an interview. "About 9,000 are
driving to Santa Barbara each day."</TE>

<HD>June Jordan, 65; Prolific Essayist, Poet, Professor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>June Jordan, a poet, essayist and influential UC Berkeley professor
of African American studies, died Friday at her home in Berkeley. She
was 65 and died of breast cancer, which she had been battling for
much of the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   The woman of diverse talents wrote 28 books of poetry, essays and
children's fiction since the late 1960s. She also wrote librettos,
including one for the 1995 song-play "I Was Looking at the Ceiling
And Then I Saw the Sky," directed by Peter Sellars with music by John
Adams.</LD>
<LD>   But her major contributions were her collections of essays,
notably "Technical Difficulties: New Political Essays" and
"Affirmative Acts: New Political Essays," and poetry collections,
including "Naming Our Destinies" and "Kissing God Goodbye." Her
autobiography, "Soldier: a Poet's Childhood," was released in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Her work, poet Adrienne Rich said Friday, came from her deep
concern for language and her individual style. And though her writing
was often political, dealing with feminism, the black experience,
children and education, it could also be extremely literary.</TE>
<TE>   "She used language with great elegance and precision and in a very
individual way," Rich said. "After reading a work by her, it would be
hard to imagine that it could have been done by anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Harlem in New York City, the only child of West Indian
immigrants, Jordan grew up in Brooklyn. Her mother was a nurse and
her father a postal worker.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan spoke later of the verbal and physical abuse she faced as a
child but also noted that her parents had great aspirations for her
intellectually and educationally, and that her father introduced her
to poetry.</TE>
<TE>   She was the only black student in a New York City prep school, and
later attended the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts,
where her interest in writing was encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, she entered Barnard College, where she met her future
husband, Michael Myer, a white student. They divorced in 1965 after
facing years of public intolerance of interracial marriages. They had
one child, a son, Christopher.</TE>
<TE>   Interested in urban planning, Jordan studied with R. Buckminster
Fuller in the early 1960s and conceived an "architectural redesign
[plan] for Harlem," which was published in Esquire magazine in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, she began her teaching career at City College of New
York, the first of a series of positions that included stops at Yale
University and Sarah Lawrence College and finally led to her
appointment as a tenured professor at State University of New York at
Stony Brook. She left that campus in 1989 for a post at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Her classes at Berkeley were wildly popular. She was also the
founder and director of the Poetry for the People program at the
university.</TE>
<TE>   In that program, according to Rich, she taught undergraduate
students how to teach poetry and they would take it out to the
community, offering workshops in secondary schools and prisons and to
homeless people throughout the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted students to write for themselves and develop an
independence in style," Rich said. "The ripple effect of her teaching
was enormous."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan told a Times reporter some years ago that she viewed
writing poetry as devotional work.</TE>
<TE>   "When I sit down to write a poem, it's like listening. I'm
listening for a poem. I have to get quiet enough to hear it.
Basically, I can't, like, invent stuff. Poetry is not fiction."</TE>
<TE>   A critic in the journal Poetry noted that Jordan's literary
"expression is developed out of, or through, a fine irony that
manages to control her bitterness, even to dominate her rage against
the intolerable, so that she can laugh and cry, be melancholic and
scornful, presenting always the familiar faces of human personality,
integral personality."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was not concerned about taking difficult political stances
in her writing and commentary on world issues. She believed that no
single issue could be separated from the rest.</TE>
<TE>   She offered backing for the Palestinians in the early 1980s and
condemned the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. She later said her
position cost her work in the journalism community and some ostracism
in the feminist press.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, she organized a teach-in against the arms
build-up in the Middle East. Near the end of the Persian Gulf War,
she wrote a long poem, "The Bombing of Baghdad," which drew parallels
between that war's bombing and the U.S. persecution of American
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently she was a columnist for The Progressive, reflecting
on the African American experience to questions of international
politics and domestic policies under several administrations.</TE>
<TE>   "She was well-informed and brilliant," Rich said.</TE>
<TE>   Her numerous awards over the years included The Berkeley Citation
for distinguished achievement and notable service, presented last
year by the University of California; a congressional citation for
her outstanding contributions to literature, the progressive movement
and the civil rights movement, awarded in 1990; a Prix de Rome in
environmental design in 1970; and a Rockefeller grant in creative
writing in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Information on her survivors was not immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Police Put the Brakes on YoungJaywalkers</HD>
<DH>Safety: The rising number of accidents near schools has
L.A. officers writing up students on pedestrian and bicycle
violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alarmed by a rise in pedestrian and bicycle accidents involving
children, Los Angeles school police have issued hundreds of tickets
in the last few months to students as young as 9.</LD>
<LD>   The crackdown targets children near schools who jaywalk, dart
through traffic on bicycles or ride without helmets. The citations
require children and their parents to attend a Saturday pedestrian
traffic school or, for repeat offenders, to pay fines of as much as
$80.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the most dangerous moments in children's lives occur when
they are traveling to and from school, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, traffic accidents involving child pedestrians
jumped 23% last year to 919 incidents, from 746 in 2000, according to
Los Angeles Police Department figures. In 2001, 15 child pedestrians
were killed, compared with nine the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 2001, bicyclists under the age of 18 were involved in 379
traffic collisions, up 49% from the year before, according to the
LAPD. One child bicyclist was killed last year; there were no
fatalities the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown is led by Los Angeles Unified School District
police, who just a few years ago issued only a handful of citations
to youth pedestrians. Until now, the department has focused primarily
on ticketing drivers when they speed, double-park or make illegal
stops near schools.</TE>
<TE>   But targeting drivers dealt with only part of the problem, said
Tana Ball, director of the school police's pedestrian and bicyclist
safety program. So officers are now on the lookout for pedestrian and
bike violators as well.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it may help save lives, the get-tough effort has left
some teenagers fuming. In Woodland Hills recently, Taft High School
seniors Melissa Barker and Joanna Lord sauntered mid-block across
Winnetka Avenue en route to the campus. They had barely reached the
curb when an officer strode over to them. Minutes later, the
teenagers had identical citations fluttering from their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Puh-leeze," said Barker, rolling her eyes as the officer left to
cite more students. "We jaywalk every day," but are always careful to
look before crossing, Barker said. "[Police] should have better
things to do with their time."</TE>
<TE>   Police and school officials counter that tougher enforcement makes
children think twice about breaking traffic safety laws.</TE>
<TE>   Jaywalking used to be "a horrible problem" at Taft, said Principal
Myra Fullerton. But since police stepped up patrols, more students
have been using crosswalks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Guilmer Mancia, 16, is one of them. "I used to jaywalk ... but
then I stopped," she said. "I was afraid they would give me a
ticket." Sometimes, the parents are more annoyed than the children
who receive tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Across from Parkman Middle School near Warner Center, Natalie
Nasimova of Encino didn't hide her displeasure when an officer handed
her daughter a ticket. "I don't understand why you stopped my child!"
she shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Though Helen, 13, was in a crosswalk, the officer said she walked
in front of a car that was already driving through the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not fair--she didn't do anything wrong," Nasimova said,
at first refusing to let her daughter provide the officer with any
identifying information.</TE>
<TE>   "Arrest me! Take me to jail!" the mother shouted, as the daughter
sobbed. Nasimova eventually relented.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers said they've heard it all from unhappy parents,
from profanity to comments such as, "Why don't you go get some
doughnuts?"</TE>
<TE>   Other parents are more supportive of the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "They should do this at all the schools," said Cathleen Fager, a
Sherman Oaks stay-at-home mom who was waiting to pick up a child from
school.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that many parents and students aren't aware of how
hazardous the roads in front of schools can be.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most dangerous transportation zones for children is
right in front of a school, according to the traffic safety agency.
In Los Angeles, where many students live too far away from the
schools they attend to walk, more parents drive their children,
choking the streets around campuses with traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Students who are dropped off can face greater dangers than those
who walk from home, officers said. The ones whose parents stop across
the street sometimes bolt straight from the car to campus without
using a crosswalk.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown is occurring citywide, using school district police
as well as LAPD and Los Angeles Department of Transportation
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Most officers issue tickets to children over the age of 9 or 10.
The youngest pupils are given impromptu sidewalk lectures on
pedestrian safety tips.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't realize we're doing this for their own good," said
LAPD Officer Tim Olsen, after a Woodland Hills high school student,
with a citation in hand, stomped away.</TE>
<TE>   "I would much rather a kid get a ticket than get scraped off a
street, get hit by a car," he said.</TE>

<HD>From the Klan to the Pulpit</HD>
<DH>Transition: Encounter with a black minister forever changed
the life and attitudes of a former KKK official.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAYTON BELLAMY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TULSA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>On a night in 1979, Ku Klux Klan leader Johnny Lee Clary patted his
white sheet as he waited in a radio station for his debate opponent,
a civil rights activist named the Rev. Wade Watts.</LD>
<LD>   Clary expected Watts to hate whites as much as Clary hated blacks.
But when Watts walked into the broadcast booth, he smiled and told
Clary he loved him.</LD>
<LD>   Clary, then the Klan's grand dragon, was stunned. He had set a
fire that damaged Watts' church in McAlester, Okla.--a crime for
which he was never prosecuted.</LD>
<TE>   It was that night that Clary first began to doubt his racist
convictions. In another decade, he left the Klan as imperial wizard
and, a couple of years after that, he began his itinerant ministry
against racism.</TE>
<TE>   Clary now draws crowds around the world who come to hear his story
of failure and redemption, of overcoming racism in one of its ugliest
forms.</TE>
<TE>   Clary credits much of his transformation to Watts, who marched
with Martin Luther King Jr. and led the Oklahoma NAACP for 16 years.
The men became close friends before Watts' death in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me what it was like to be black, what black people feel
about the things they've been through," Clary said recently at his
small Tulsa apartment, a poster of King behind him. "I became a man
who looked at himself in the mirror and decided it was time to change
that man."</TE>
<TE>   Clary, who turns 43 this month, spent his early childhood in
Oklahoma. When he was 11, his father committed suicide--shooting
himself in the head with a pistol in front of his son. The boy was
sent to Los Angeles to live with his sister.</TE>
<TE>   Living in a gang-ridden L.A. neighborhood, mostly among youths
from other races, Clary didn't fit in. Racism he had learned in
Oklahoma--he remembers his father directing a racial slur at a black
man when he was 5--became ingrained as Clary was shunted aside.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody seemed to care about this 14-year-old kid," he said. "I
was about ready to give up when I turned on the TV and saw David Duke
talking about the KKK."</TE>
<TE>   The white supremacist's speech reminded Clary of talks his father
had had with his uncle, a Klansman from Georgia. Clary wrote Duke,
who sent a man to his Los Angeles door.</TE>
<TE>   That Klansman wore a big belt buckle, glasses and a Western shirt.
He reminded Clary of his father.</TE>
<TE>   "You've been through a horrible life," Clary remembers the man
telling him. "What you need is a family, and the words 'Ku Klux Klan'
come from the Greek word kuklux, which means circle, and klan from
Scotland, which means family."</TE>
<TE>   Clary joined the Klan youth corps, becoming an adult member at 17
and quickly rising through the ranks. Returning to Oklahoma, he
became the grand dragon there and later imperial wizard, a rank
similar to national spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   But after his encounter with Watts, Clary began to question his
devotion to the KKK.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard the Klan and the skinheads say they wanted to kill
all the blacks, I used to think of Rev. Watts and think, 'Do you
really want to see this man hurt?' " Clary said. "He was such a good
man that I started doubting all these things I was supposed to
teach."</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Clary told the Klan's Grand Council he was quitting.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Clary said he felt God calling on him to
preach. He called Watts and asked forgiveness. Watts, in turn, asked
him to deliver a sermon at his all-black church, the one that Clary
had set ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   When Clary went to the white, pillbox-shaped church in McAlester,
he was too nervous to think about the last time he'd been there, he
said. Watts, the uncle of Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), had warned his
faithful the week before that the former KKK leader was coming. Many
stayed home.</TE>
<TE>   The worshipers in the worn wooden pews crossed their arms and
stared at Clary with lowered brows, he said. He got no "hallelujahs"
or "amens" when he told of his reformation.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he asked if anyone would like to know Jesus as their
savior, and a teenage girl cried and ran to the pulpit to hug Clary.
The ice was broken.</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, Clary and Watts traveled across the South
together, preaching against racism and protesting at Klan rallies.</TE>
<TE>   "He became like family to us," said Betty Watts, the minister's
widow. "He always came down [to McAlester] to tell us how much he
loved us."</TE>
<TE>   Clary believes his ministry, which he calls Operation Colorblind
Inc., has helped thousands avoid or escape a life of racism.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate looking back at the person that I used to be," said Clary,
who is ordained by the International Charismatic Bible Ministries. "I
would hate to live it all over again. But if it's the only way all
these lives would be helped, then I'd do it."</TE>

<HD>Thrice as Nice for Lakers and Fans</HD>
<DH>Celebration: After a third annual downtown parade and
Staples Center rally, Kobe proposes to all assembled, 'Let's do it
again next year!'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL and PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd think they had never done this before. But no: Fans performed
their own three-peat on Friday, converging on downtown, giddy in
purple and gold, celebrating the Lakers' third straight NBA
championship as if it were the first.</LD>
<LD>   A crowd, estimated by Los Angeles police at 150,000, swept south
from City Hall, where the festivities began in the morning, down
Figueroa Street and across parking lots in front of Staples Center
where the Lakers took to the stage. They carried Laker pennants,
video cameras, dazed babies and an undying enthusiasm.</LD>
<LD>   "It never gets old when the Lakers win a championship," said
Taylor Ogata, an 18-year-old University of Kentucky student who flew
in from Lexington for the occasion.</LD>
<TE>   "He comes out every championship season," said his cousin, Julie
Valles, 30, of Torrance, who strolled with him and her 4-month-old
son, Joshua.</TE>
<TE>   "Sacramento will never be the capital of California," exulted
Shaquille O'Neal at the Staples Center rally, referring to the team's
hard-fought seven-game battle over the Kings for the Western
Conference title that preceded its NBA Finals victory in a four-game
sweep over the New Jersey Nets. "Los Angeles is the real capital of
California."</TE>
<TE>   The celebration created traffic headaches that were compounded by
large graduation ceremonies at UCLA and USC. But it showed that the
city--famously fractured and, this year, possibly literally breaking
apart through secession--can be united, at least for a day.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone jaded by the Lakers' third championship in a row stayed
home--or at work. And many who work downtown took advantage of their
proximity to drink in the atmosphere. Through the open windows of the
Wilshire Grand Hotel and Center, people snapped pictures and showered
shredded paper on the victorious athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a team that just makes you fall in love with them," said
Ramona Streiff, 50, who said she suffers from fibromyalgia but still
came out from her Pico Rivera home anyway. "Whenever I'm in pain, I
turn on a game and it makes my pain go away."</TE>
<TE>   At 3rd and Figueroa, the crowd erupted in cheers as the cadre of
LAPD motorcycle officers revved their engines, signaling the start of
the parade toward Staples Center. In contrast to a host of other
testy encounters between police and bystanders during L.A. street
events of the last few years, officers high-fived spectators as they
drove by.</TE>
<TE>   Behind them came the Lakers and entourage--11 double-decker buses,
four fire trucks, and the Anheuser-Busch Clydesdale horses. In
addition to the players and their families on the buses were coaches,
staffers, team sponsors and city officials. The Laker Girls and the
Laker band--the latter playing the "Rocky" theme--rode on firetrucks.</TE>
<TE>   At every turn of the parade route, fans chanted the names of their
favorite players--"Horry! Horry!" or "Kobe! Kobe!" or, in the case of
O'Neal, named the Finals most valuable player for a third straight
year, simply "MVP! MVP!" The players basked in the attention.</TE>
<TE>   Annie Jewell, 14, of Los Feliz, sported a tribute to Laker reserve
Mark Madsen on her white T-shirt that read "I Love You Mad Dog." Kobe
Bryant pointed her out to a delighted Madsen, who high-fived his
teammate in appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen tossed his baseball cap toward the teenager. But others in
the crowd snatched it first. With Jewell still running alongside the
bus, Madsen pulled his own T-shirt off and prepared to toss it to his
fan. A group of parade watchers stepped up to form a protective ring
around the girl and ensure that no one intercepted the gift. Madsen
lobbed the shirt into the girl's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me!" she
told her mother as the parade moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn sat atop the first double-decker
tour bus. Between waves, Hahn snapped pictures of the fans with a
pocket camera, showing more interest in the politely applauding
spectators than they did in him.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd count, which the LAPD based on an aerial view from their
helicopters, according to Cmdr. Gary Brennan, was a fraction of the
million figure being bandied about on television during the day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked," said Michael Roth, director of communications for
Staples Center when told the police were estimating the crowd at
150,000. "Honest to God, I think there were that many in Parking Lot
3 alone." Roth estimated the overall crowd from City Hall to Staples
Center at 1 million.</TE>
<TE>   There were 1,000 LAPD personnel on hand to control the crowd.
Brennan said there was one arrest--a man in a public restroom near
Staples Center was unlawfully carrying a handgun. The Fire Department
had 26 medical-aid calls, according to Brennan. All were minor.</TE>
<TE>   Even members of the large law enforcement contingent stationed
along the parade route were in a celebratory mood as the players
approached. At the corner of 7th and Figueroa streets, Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Deputies Albert Archuleta and Lee Baca (not the
sheriff, but a deputy who happens to share his name) borrowed a pair
of $10 purple-and-yellow feather boas and dangled them over their
uniforms, posing for a souvenir snapshot.</TE>
<TE>   The purple-and-gold herd veered off Figueroa and made a beeline
through the Staples Center parking lot, trampling plants that fringe
the lot. They wore Laker jerseys that spanned every era--from West to
Johnson to Shaq and Kobe--and blew their hardest on purple-and-gold
plastic horns.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Picasso and Rudy Rodriguez, both 30, charged fans $5 to pose
for pictures with three replica championship trophies they fashioned
out of papier-mache and gilded with spray paint.</TE>
<TE>   The two friends said they have been to all three parades in the
streak, but "we're old-school fans," Rodriguez said, recalling years
past when there were no parades.</TE>
<TE>   Another fan, Jay Love, 33, cruised around on a purple-and-gold
bike he salvaged four months ago from a yard sale for $5. Love
estimated he has spent close to $600 on the custom paint job, a fuzzy
steering wheel in Laker colors and twisted gold chrome fender
holders.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked to the parade last year," Love said, while fan after fan
complimented him on his taste. "But this way is better."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, participation in this event required a high tolerance
for closeness with fellow fans and the merchants trying to sell to
them. Vendors with pizza, water bottles and Laker flags set up tents
and tables that blocked the public sidewalk near the corner of
Olympic and Figueroa--right under the noses of LAPD officers.</TE>
<TE>   There was pushing and shoving, and a few in the crowd tossed
plastic water bottles into the air as fans struggled to walk along
the blocked sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on stage outside Staples Center, longtime Laker
announcer Chick Hearn introduced the players as they rose up from
under the stage on hidden elevating platforms in a kind of Star
Trek-y beam-me-up routine.</TE>
<TE>   After introducing Madsen, Hearn urged the forward who rarely sees
playing time to repeat the herky-jerky dance he made famous at last
year's celebration. Madsen obliged, breaking into a series of
frantic, writhing moves that sent the crowd and his teammates into a
frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Showing that he was already thinking beyond three-peat, Bryant
proclaimed, "Let's do it again next year!"</TE>

<HD>R. Locke, 68; Editor, Author of History of the Navajo</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raymond Friday Locke, author of the definitive history of the Navajo
people and a veteran editor of Holloway House, a Los Angeles-based
publisher, has died. He was 68.</LD>
<LD>   Locke, whose 1976 "Book of the Navajo" is now in its sixth
edition, died June 8 in Palm Springs of cardiac arrest, the
publishing company announced. He was a resident of Studio City.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Montgomery County, Miss., Locke attended the
universities of Mississippi and Wisconsin, and as an adult became
involved with Native American causes.</LD>
<TE>   He was a member of the Navajo Tribal Ad Hoc Committee studying the
social, economic and cultural effects of the relocation of Navajos
from their native lands to reservations. He also served on the boards
of the Urban Indian Development Assn. and the American Indian
Scholarship Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Locke used his abilities as a writer and historian to craft "Book
of the Navajo," which is used extensively as a high school and
college textbook in Native American studies. In 1989, he wrote a
follow-up called "Sweet Salt: Discovering the Sacred World of the
Navajo," about tribal spirituality.</TE>
<TE>   A popular lecturer on the history of the American West and Native
Americans, Locke was the founding editor of the history magazine
Mankind. He also edited its "Great Adventures of Mankind" series. He
joined Holloway House after the publisher acquired Mankind
Publishing. Holloway published "Book of the Navajo."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1959, Holloway House originally published books about
Hollywood, but began working toward a more diverse market with
publication in 1968 of Louis Lomax's "To Kill a Black Man."</TE>
<TE>   The company became a major venue for aspiring black authors, and
published several volumes by popular "ghetto realist" novelists
Robert Beck (also known as Iceberg Slim) and Donald Goines.</TE>
<TE>   With the acquisition of Mankind, which was devoted to publishing
works by and about Native Americans, Holloway House became the only
national paperback publisher devoted exclusively to multicultural
fare.</TE>
<TE>   The company tested the Spanish-language market but backed out,
Locke told The Times in 1993, because "we found that market to be a
very difficult market. If you write about Mexican culture, you're not
going to sell to Cuba. There's no common cultural bond."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his 20 years as editor for the publishing house,
Locke also had worked as managing editor of the Hollywood Reporter.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote more than a dozen books, including the novels "Streets
Paved with Gold" and "Seldom Sung Songs." "Streets" was turned into
the 1965 Russ Meyer cult film "Mud Honey," with Locke and Meyer
co-writing the screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Locke is survived by two sisters and two brothers.</TE>

<HD>The Ever-Changing Depiction of Mary Magdalene in Art</HD>
<DH>Exhibit: In renderings ranging from saint to sinner, the
enigmatic figure's portrayals in media are explored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS HERLINGER</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Was she a sinner? A witness? A prostitute? A muse?</LD>
<LD>   She is all of these things--or none of them. She might well have
been a composite of different women.</LD>
<LD>   But whoever the woman now known as Mary Magdalene was, her
depiction in the Christian Gospels and in religious and secular art
has exerted an unusually powerful influence over the Western
imagination.</LD>
<TE>   With the exception of Jesus and his mother, probably no other
figure in the Gospel narratives has been so revered or so often the
subject of devotion.</TE>
<TE>   But Mary Magdalene's place in the Christian tradition has also
been enigmatic--and has resulted in portrayals ranging from sinner to
saint, from "fallen woman" to figure of redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "Who she is is almost impossible to say," said scholar Diane
Apostolos-Cappadona, co-curator of an exhibit, "In Search of Mary
Magdalene: Images and Traditions," now at the gallery of the American
Bible Society in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "In Search of Mary" explores the ways in which Mary Magdalene has
been portrayed in the visual arts. The exhibit includes paintings,
prints, sculptures, manuscript illustrations and even stills from
such films as Cecil B. DeMille's 1927 silent classic "The King of
Kings."</TE>
<TE>   Though small in size, the exhibit explores its subject with a
mixture of historical depth, theological grounding and a dash of
"postmodern" intellectual investigation--inviting the question of
what the various portrayals of Mary in visual art tell us about the
societies that produced them.</TE>
<TE>   "How she came to be formidable to explain entails an arduous
journey," Apostolos-Cappadona said in an essay, "through a matrix of
oral and written traditions, theology, spirituality, ritual,
mythology, art, culture, values, and the human psyche."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention some murkiness at the beginning of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Apostolos-Cappadona notes that there has been "a muddle of
Marys"--the Christian Gospels mention at least seven Marys, three of
them particularly well-known: Mary, the mother of Jesus; Mary of
Bethany, the sister of Lazarus and Martha; and the Mary called Mary
of Magdala, or Mary Magdalene.</TE>
<TE>   The canonical Gospels emphasize different aspects of this Mary:
Matthew, Mark and John describe her as standing at the foot of the
cross; Luke says Mary was one of Jesus' earliest followers; Mark and
Luke portray her as the person from whom Jesus cast out seven demons.</TE>
<TE>   All of the narratives describe her as one of the holy women who
heard the announcement of Jesus' resurrection, having first tried to
anoint Jesus' body; Matthew, Mark and John all portray her as the
first witness to the resurrection. It is this portrayal that has
perhaps most endeared her to artists and Christian believers.</TE>
<TE>   But as the ABS exhibit makes clear, there have been numerous Mary
traditions, and the depiction of Mary Magdalene changed with the
course of church history.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from her importance in the Gospel narrative as resurrection
witness, Mary's most important role in Christian tradition has been
of penitential saint, as in Carlo Dolci's "The Penitent Magdalene," a
17th century oil painting depicting a tearful, haunted woman urgently
praying to the heavens.</TE>
<TE>   Differing Christian traditions also appropriated Mary: Catholic
painters depicted her as a defender of Roman Catholic sacraments
during the Counter-Reformation, while 16th century Flemish painters,
feeling the tide of an emerging Protestant culture and wanting to
downplay the importance of Mary, Jesus' mother, chose to reemphasize
Mary Magdalene's penitence. Others opted to depict Mary Magdalene as
a contemplative, as in a 1520 painting of Mary reading her prayer
book.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most striking are 19th century depictions of Mary as the
"femme fatale." In "Mary Magdalene at the House of the Pharisee"
(1891), the French painter Jean Beraud depicts Mary as attired in an
ornate gown and melodramatically kneeling at the foot of Jesus,
surrounded by European captains of industry as they finish their
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The 20th century has brought a variety of portrayals, including
American Wendy Brusick Steiner's "I've Seen Love Conquer the Great
Divide" (1989), in which Mary Magdalene assumes the traditional pose
of cradling the dead Jesus' feet.</TE>
<TE>   Apostolos-Cappadona, who teaches at Georgetown University, said in
an interview that what makes Mary endlessly fascinating is the
inherent mystery of the woman herself and "all of the layers we have
placed on her through the centuries."</TE>
<TE>   To Christians, Mary Magdalene has been an "approachable figure,"
she said. "Mary Magdalene is like the rest of us--not perfect--and in
that sense is a model for faith."</TE>
<TE>   "She is like a mirror," said Apostolos-Cappadona. "She has all of
these dimensions and yet we still ask, 'Who is she?' "</TE>
<TE>   "In Search of Mary: Images and Traditions" continues through June
29 at the gallery of the American Bible Society. Its Web site is

<HD>Power Plants Sprouting at Border</HD>
<DH>Energy: In Mexico, they can emit more pollution than in
U.S. Backers tout chance to serve 2 nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mexican border, comparatively free of red tape and smog
regulations, is becoming a magnet for U.S. power plants, which will
be able to emit up to 10 times more pollution than is allowed under
California law.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen big generating stations are under construction, being
expanded or planned on both sides of the 1,500-mile-long border from
California to Texas, with the majority of them in Mexico. Proponents
of the trend see it as a natural response to favorable economic
conditions--including cheap labor--as well as an opportunity to serve
markets in the United States and Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Critics in Congress, air quality agencies and the environmental
movement say companies are saving millions of dollars by evading
stringent emissions controls that would apply if the plants were
being built north of the border.</LD>
<TE>   Some plants are being erected in sparsely populated areas. But in
at least one location, south of Imperial County in Mexicali, about 1
million people--mostly poor Latinos--on both sides of the border
could be exposed to plant emissions.</TE>
<TE>   "Plants in Mexico are being proposed without any add-on controls.
It's a convenient back door to put projects that are less palatable
in the U.S.A.," said Bill Powers, a San Diego air quality consultant
and spokesman for the Border Power Plant Working Group, which has
filed a lawsuit to force more rigorous power plant cleanups along the
border. Add-on controls capture or treat emissions before they leave
plant smokestacks.</TE>
<TE>   A microcosm of global trade, Mexico's expanding power plant
industry will burn natural gas arriving via pipeline from Canada and
the United States or from bulk marine terminals receiving shipments
from South America and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The electricity will flow into a grid to be used anywhere between
Mexico City and the Pacific Northwest. Indeed, an increasing amount
of power will be needed just along the border as it becomes home to
more people and industries.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly see heightened interest in projects along the border
between Baja and California as investors look for ways to reach the
California market and develop the northern reaches of Mexico. We're
seeing a lot more energy integration across the border," said Jed
Bailey, associate director for Latin America for Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, a research and consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Construction costs are low in Mexico; at the border there is more
availability of fuel than in the rest of the country; and a company
can receive a permit in six to eight months. That is why they are
building here," said Alberto Ramos Elorduy, deputy director of
Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Two power plants in particular--being built by U.S. companies near
Mexicali, three miles south of the border--are drawing intense
opposition. Massachusetts-based InterGen Energy Inc. is erecting its
La Rosita plant, a 1,065-megawatt facility that will cost $748
million and produce enough electricity for 1.5 million households.
Nearby, Sempra Energy Resources is building Termoelectrica de
Mexicali, a $350-million plant.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the companies downplay air pollution concerns. They
say the plants employ some clean technologies to reduce emissions and
are a vast improvement over older coal-fired generators still in use
in some places in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges that the
Sempra plant will perform nearly as cleanly as one built on U.S.
soil. Both facilities will burn natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel
available, and Mexican authorities say they will be the least
polluting in that country.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not come to Mexicali to avoid U.S. regulations. When we
are building something this close to the border, we wanted to make
sure we were not going to have environmental impacts on the other
side of the border," said John Foster, InterGen's senior vice
president for Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Yet even the most advanced plants in Mexico do not meet the
stringent pollution controls of the U.S. Clean Air Act. Unlike a new
power plant built in the United States, those in Mexico are not
required to "offset" their emissions. Offsets are pollution
reductions a company pays for at nearby factories, businesses or
power plants to more than compensate for the added emissions created
by the new power plant.</TE>
<TE>   The InterGen plant will use four turbines to generate electricity.
Two units will produce power for Mexico and will have no add-on
emissions control devices. The two that feed energy to the U.S. will
be fitted with the devices. The two uncontrolled units will be
allowed to emit about 10 times more nitrogen oxide than would be
permitted if the plant were built in California, according to the
EPA.</TE>
<TE>   Even the two units with add-on controls will emit about twice as
much smog-forming gas as a comparable California plant, the EPA
estimates. Nitrogen oxides contribute to ozone and tiny particles
that obscure the sky and have been linked to asthma, heart attacks
and premature death.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very concerned about the emissions," said Jack Broadbent,
director of air programs for the EPA's Southwest office. "We believe
they will negatively impact air quality" in California's southeastern
desert.</TE>
<TE>   But the EPA's jurisdiction ends at the border. The Energy
Department issued permits for cross-border electrical transmission
lines but says it cannot regulate the design or operation of power
plants in Mexico, although environmentalists have filed a lawsuit
disputing that.</TE>
<TE>   "It just highlights the disconnect between those in the Bush
administration who look at the environmental factors and those who
are interested in promoting the business interests of energy
companies," said Martin Wagner, director of international projects
for the Oakland-based Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial County in California and neighboring Mexicali just across
the border would probably bear the brunt of the pollution. Mexicali
is a fast-growing city of 800,000.</TE>
<TE>   A patchwork of farms and small towns spanning 580,000 acres, the
Imperial Valley produces much of the nation's wintertime vegetables
under a pall of some of the country's dirtiest air. The county
violates national air quality standards for soot and smoke an average
of one day in three, as well as occasionally exceeding limits for
carbon monoxide and ozone.It is one of the poorest regions of the
state, and about 85% of the population is Latino. Health officials
say the incidence of respiratory disease there is twice the statewide
average.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent assessment, the EPA concluded that smoke and dust from
various sources blowing across the border from Mexicali are primarily
responsible for pollution violations in Imperial County. Indeed, the
county would have met U.S. air quality standards eight years ago had
pollution from Mexico been checked, according to the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial County Air Pollution Control District estimates that
the InterGen plant alone will release about 4,000 tons of pollutants
into the region annually, although company officials say the facility
will not have a serious effect on California.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some serious heartburn about the InterGen plant," said
Steve Birdsall, air pollution control officer for Imperial County.
"It's going to have a significant impact on the Imperial Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Despite those concerns, expansion of energy resources in Mexico is
a priority for the Bush administration and Mexico's leaders. It is
precisely the sort of development envisioned when the North American
Free Trade Agreement was approved to promote closer economic
integration among Mexico, the United States and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government has encouraged foreign companies to develop
energy resources; the nation potentially faces blackouts nationwide
by 2004 unless more power plants are built, analysts say. Regulators
say the country needs about 40 mid-size plants in the next eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing the opportunity, a Spanish company has decided to build a
500-megawatt plant in Agua Prieta just south of the Arizona border
town of Douglas; a French utility seeks to build two power plants
near Matamoros a few miles south of Brownsville, Texas; and a
Swiss-Swedish consortium is expanding a power plant near Ensenada,
according to the Border Power Plant Working Group and Mexican
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The national energy plan that President Bush unveiled last year
calls for accelerating cross-border energy investment, improving
electricity grids and expanding oil and gas pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
approved construction of a 215-mile gas pipeline extension from
Arizona to Tijuana to deliver the fuel from Canada and the United
States to power plants along the border. The pipeline is expected to
be completed this summer.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Bush approved permits for cross-border power
transmission lines to reach the controversial power plants in Baja.
An Energy Department assessment concluded that the project will not
significantly affect air quality along the border, but critics say
the study was cursory and are calling for a more detailed review.</TE>
<TE>   The Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Wild Earth Advocates and the
Border Power Plant Working Group sued in March to block completion of
the electricity transmission lines until a detailed study of power
plant emissions is done.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, California lawmakers probably face an uphill fight to
win passage of bills, introduced last week, to prohibit U.S.-produced
natural gas from being used in power plants in Baja until the plants
comply with California emissions standards. The legislation is
sponsored by Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer in the
Senate and Republican Duncan Hunter of Alpine in the House.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not unreasonable to ensure that companies making money in
the California energy market meet strict environmental standards,"
Feinstein said. "This legislation will help ensure power plants along
the border employ the best technology available to control pollution
in Southern California and other border areas."</TE>

<LD>I recently poked fun at the newly formed Surfing Lawyers Assn., but I
have to admit that founder David Olan has a sense of humor. Sure, he
wrote back to point out the group is supporting serious causes such
as the Santa Monica Beach Restoration project. But he also said that
the wave-riding barristers know that if they're "in the water during
a big winter swell and a great white shark approaches us, he will
leave us alone--professional courtesy, of course!"</LD>
<LD>   So that's why this library's so quiet: Matthew Hetz of L.A.
noticed a sign in Westchester that no doubt stopped a lot of people
from trying to go inside (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   Hey! Like the hair today! I always figured that established male
TV anchors needed a lot of compliments, so I wasn't surprised when I
read the job posting that Dick Block of Santa Monica sent along (see
accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Not that he's in a hurry to find out, but
Simon Wilder of Cambria wonders if there is such a thing as partial
cremation (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   This column will be delayed 30 seconds for this item: Two of the
questions that local traffic reporters are asked most frequently
concern SigAlerts. Mainly, what the heck are they? And what does
SigAlert stand for? Well, a SigAlert is an unplanned lane closure of
30 minutes or more.</TE>
<TE>   As for its meaning, the myth-busters at snopes.com say that one
urban folk tale holds that the term Sig is an acronym for "Stay in
Garage" (false, but not bad advice). The more common myth is that
it's short for "signal." Actually, the term was coined in 1955 to
honor Loyd Sigmon, a radio executive who helped create a radio link
with police dispatchers to alert motorists of traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   Now it can be told: Some end-of-the-semester reflections from Jean
Huston's third-graders at McGaugh Elementary School in Seal Beach, as
recorded in the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise:</TE>
<TE>   * Travis Soares: "In third grade, I never lost a tooth until May."</TE>
<TE>   * Brandon Sargent: "Some of my third-grade memories are when we
took apart an owl pellet, when we passed out valentines and when we
wore our Halloween costumes for a parade."</TE>
<TE>   * Laura Fast: "One of the really funny things I will always
remember is when Jessica yelled, 'I love Bobby Woyjeck!' "</TE>
<TE>   * Michele Zarate: "I will always remember recess."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: You can imagine the panic Friday morning among
Westside sophisticates at one Starbuck's, which was having equipment
problems. "Sorry," the clerk said, as though it were the saddest news
he'd ever delivered, "but all we have is coffee right now."</TE>

<HD>Farmers Enlist Barn Owl in War on Gophers</HD>
<DH>San Joaquin Valley growers make the birds at home as a way
to fight the pesky rodent.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the perspective of a pitiful pocket gopher, the barn owl must
seem like the perfect killing machine.</LD>
<LD>   Consider:</LD>
<LD>   The owls see prey in the dark from several hundred feet away.</LD>
<TE>   They can hear a mouse munching on a seed or pushing through dirt
from a similar distance.</TE>
<TE>   Their bones are hollow and their feathers light, allowing them to
soar in total silence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a ghost owl flying by," said Tom Hoffman, who grows
wine grapes in Lodi. "That's until they let out a screech that jars
your nerves."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman is one of many people in the San Joaquin Valley who in
recent years have learned the value of the raptors in fighting public
enemy No. 1 for the region's growers, the pocket gopher.</TE>
<TE>   While gophers certainly play an important role in native
ecosystems, they're tough on a farm. Of their many crimes, the two
worst are gnawing holes in irrigation lines and killing trees and
crops by chewing on their roots. Both can lead to costly losses.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers have long relied on several strategies to exterminate
gophers, including the flooding of fields, trapping and the use of
poisons called rodenticides. All are expensive and time-consuming,
and the use of poisons is frowned upon by conservationists and many
farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Weary of the never-ending war on the gophers, several growers in
the late 1980s decided to use nature as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the barn owl.</TE>
<TE>   Native to much of the United States, the owls nest in cavities of
dead trees, cliffs and buildings--thus the species' name. Because the
owls have no fear of people, farmers have learned that erecting a
suitable nesting box is a sure way to attract the birds.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, area farmers were finding impressive piles of gopher
bones, skulls and fur near the nesting boxes, the indigestible
material that owls cough up in pellets. Word of mouth about this new
form of pest control spread quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Today, nobody knows precisely how many valley farms have owl
boxes, but the consensus is that there are many. And there is no
shortage of testimonials from growers.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Rocha, an almond grower in Newman, said: "As soon as it starts
getting dark out, they start leaving their boxes. I take my grandkids
out to watch them."</TE>
<TE>   Hal Carlton, an almond grower and dairy farmer in Hughson, said:
"We have four lagoons, where the waste water goes from the dairy
cows. We put an owl box near each one, because if a gopher digs a
hole in the side of the lagoon, we've got a big-time mess."</TE>
<TE>   Justin Pareira, who grows alfalfa, oats and corn in Merced said
that "I had someone come over to bale my hay and he said, 'Your
fields sure are clean. There's no gopher holes.' I said, 'It's the
owls.' "</TE>
<TE>   The owls have become so popular that an owl box building boom is
underway. Hoffman, the Lodi grape grower, is building more than 500
of them each year and said he can barely keep up with orders.</TE>
<TE>   The undisputed champion of owl boxes, however, is Steve Simmons, a
shop teacher at Merced High School. In the last five years, Simmons'
students have made and sold more than 7,000 boxes to area farmers,
most of them constructed from scrap wood.</TE>
<TE>   Money from the sales goes to a scholarship fund students can use
for college or vocational school. Overall, $125,000 in profit has
been generated from the boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons, by his own admission, is a "wannabe wildlife biologist"
and spends a good chunk of his time catching and banding barn owls,
which allows him to track how young owls disperse in the valley and
colonize new boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things in California and across the nation is that,
when a tree dies, people cut it down," Simmons said. "These birds are
desperate for places to nest. If you increase the number of nest
sites, the food base is there."</TE>
<TE>   Barn owl numbers have plummeted in many parts of the country,
including the Midwest. The cause is twofold. The rodent population
has fallen due to annual plowing of fields for crops such as corn and
soybeans, and many old structures preferred by the owls have been
razed.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Joaquin Valley, though, the boom in owl boxes has
resulted in more barn owls than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to the question: Will the owls eat all the
gophers?</TE>
<TE>   Probably not.</TE>
<TE>   Predators rarely eat their prey into extinction. When prey numbers
get low, predators often move elsewhere or switch to another food.</TE>
<TE>   There are also more gophers than ever, as year-round irrigation in
the fields provides the little beasts with constant grass to chomp.
More food means more offspring, and a female gopher can produce 20
young in a year. Most are doomed to a premature and grisly death by
predators, but the few that survive reproduce on a scale that would
impress even a rabbit.</TE>
<TE>   Just how effective, then, are the owls at gopher patrol? Studies
have shown owls can certainly eat a lot of rodents--there's evidence
that an owl family can easily dispatch 1,000 gophers in a year, plus
assorted voles, mice, shrews and moles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's no scientific proof that owls can completely
control a farmer's rodent problem, said Dirk Van Vuren, a professor
of wildlife biology at UC Davis. He thinks the owls are a step in the
right direction, but will probably have to be used in combination
with other tactics, including limited use of poisons.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I think what makes the whole thing worthwhile is that
farmers are providing habitat for wildlife," Van Vuren said. "And I
like the fact that the use of the boxes was initiated by the growers.
They weren't forced to do it by a judge or the law."</TE>
<TE>   There is another reason that barn owls are not always the perfect
solution.</TE>
<TE>   In the oaks and willows that fringe San Joaquin Valley fields,
there lurks another killer waiting for the cloak of darkness.</TE>
<TE>   When a barn owl leaves its box for its own nightly escapades, all
it takes is one moment of carelessness for a great horned owl to
swoop down, its talons slamming shut in a show of who's really in
charge.</TE>

<HD>Perot Backs Off Promise to Cooperate With Probe</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- H. Ross Perot, who promised to testify "any time, any
place" before a state legislative committee investigating Perot
Systems' blueprint for gaming the California electricity market, said
that he would not be available to testify until next month and would
not deliver requested documents to the committee.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter sent Thursday to Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana),
attorneys for Perot said he would not be available to appear at the
Capitol until after July 8. In a separate letter written Friday,
Perot's lawyers told Dunn they would deliver subpoenaed documents to
the state attorney general, not to Dunn's select committee.</LD>
<LD>   Documents subpoenaed by Dunn's committee from Reliant Energy of
Houston show that Perot Systems, founded by the former candidate for
president, peddled ways to manipulate California's fledgling
electricity market. Perot Systems had been hired in 1997 to help set
up the computer systems for the California Power Exchange, the
now-defunct marketplace for electricity under the state's
deregulation plan.</LD>
<TE>   Dunn said that Perot had promised full cooperation a week ago, and
that the news of a delay in testimony and in producing documents
"tells me that the evidence ... probably is greater than even we
expected."</TE>
<TE>   The senator said he would ask the Senate Rules Committee next week
to issue subpoenas requiring Perot and his employees to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's committee has determined that Perot Systems offered advice
on gaming California's power market to at least five energy
companies.</TE>

<HD>Year After Ouster, Detective Wants Job Back</HD>
<DH>Police: Lawyer says the 26-year veteran, fired for a sexual
relationship with alleged rape victim, is the scapegoat in city's
$25,000 settlement of lawsuit she had filed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Riverside police detective is demanding his job back, 14 months
after being fired for having a sexual relationship with a woman whose
alleged rape he was investigating.</LD>
<LD>   Al Kennedy, a 26-year member of the department, was terminated
April 16, 2001, after Chana Zucker filed a lawsuit against the
department. The Riverside resident said Kennedy used his position to
take advantage of her while looking into allegations she had been
kidnapped, raped and tortured by an unknown assailant.</LD>
<LD>   The city terminated Kennedy and settled Zucker's lawsuit this
winter for $25,000.</LD>
<TE>   But an attorney for the detective said the firing was unfair--a
politically motivated move to settle a lawsuit that never should have
been filed. "They needed a defense to [Zucker's] lawsuit," said Ken
Yuwiler, a Santa Monica attorney who will represent Kennedy at an
arbitration hearing later this month. "And one of their defenses was,
'Hey, we got rid of him.' That was their chip if they went to trial."</TE>
<TE>   To bolster his point, Yuwiler said that when the relationship
initially came to light, Kennedy's supervisor recommended nothing
more than a letter of reprimand. Newly appointed Chief Russell Leach,
however, would not approve the reprimand, adding that the behavior
was conduct unbecoming an officer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the authority who hires and fires," Leach said. "And in my
view, the case was a little more serious than that.... It goes to the
level of trust this department needs to have with the public."</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Kennedy, then a detective with
Riverside's sexual assault unit, was assigned to investigate Zucker's
kidnapping and rape allegations. During the investigation, he began
referring to her as one of his "special ladies," with whom he had a
"special relationship," her lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, Kennedy met Zucker at a hotel room with the
apparent intent of showing her some booking mugs and talking about
the case. He also brought several wine coolers, said Zucker's
attorney, Carol Watson. Kennedy, who was married at the time, also
began sending Zucker cards and love letters, Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   The pair began a sexual relationship, which Zucker said she was
afraid to end because Kennedy said he was "helping her, looking out
for her and taking care of her," court papers said.</TE>
<TE>   By January 2000, Zucker had begun seeing a therapist about the
relationship. Shortly after, she told Kennedy she was "not afraid of
him and did not want to see him again," the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   No suspects have been arrested in Zucker's alleged kidnapping,
rape and torture case.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker later sued the department, saying that her civil rights
were violated and that the department failed to adequately supervise
and control Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Yuwiler said the suit was absurd. Not only was
the relationship consensual, he said, it was Zucker who pursued it as
the investigation was ending.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question in my mind he is getting a bum rap," said
Yuwiler, who is asking for Kennedy's reinstatement and two years'
back pay. "She's the one who invited him to lunch or to go get a soda
pop or something. She continued to contact him."</TE>
<TE>   Until his final year with the department, Kennedy also typically
"met or exceeded" expectations in his annual reviews, his attorney
said. As the department prepared to fire the detective, however, his
reviews became increasingly critical, Yuwiler said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney also said that all sexual encounters between Kennedy
and Zucker happened while the detective was off duty.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Leach, however, said that mattered little to him. "This is a
serious thing, whether it happened on the clock or off the clock," he
said. "It goes to the level of trust we have with the public."</TE>

<HD>D.A. Accused of 'Sloppy Pleading' in Murder Case</HD>
<DH>Law: Justices hear arguments over filing of an
'information' in the 1993 slaying of a woman. Two sets of charges
have already been set aside.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for a 33-year-old murder defendant told a panel of
appellate court justices Friday that Ventura County prosecutors
blundered when they filed "a sloppy pleading" against their client
and should not be allowed to proceed with the case.</LD>
<LD>   Four months ago, defendant Michael Schultz was re-arrested while
in jail after a judge set aside a year-old murder indictment, ruling
that the county grand jury had been composed of too few women and
didn't reflect a fair cross-section of the community as required by
law.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than take the case to a new grand jury, prosecutors filed a
document--called a felony information--charging Schultz with murder
and related allegations in the death of a Port Hueneme woman, and the
case was set for a preliminary hearing before a judge.</LD>
<TE>   Defense lawyers challenged the second set of charges, saying
prosecutors made a mistake by filing an information instead of a
similar document called a complaint. Superior Court Judge Art
Gutierrez agreed and dismissed the case. Prosecutors challenged
Gutierrez's ruling to the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura,
which heard arguments Friday afternoon. Lawyers say the issue is
significant because, after two dismissals, the district attorney
would be barred from prosecuting Schultz in the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "In capital litigation, we don't get that many bites at the
apple," said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Schwartz, who told the
justices that the defendant has not been harmed or had his rights
violated by the wording on the disputed document.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz noted that before Gutierrez got the case, two Superior
Court judges directed prosecutors to file the case as an information
rather than a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz said Gutierrez abused his discretion and should be
reversed by the appellate court.</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Assistant Public Defender Michael McMahon argued that
Gutierrez made the proper decision when faced with a sloppy document.
McMahon held up a copy of the paperwork in court, pointing out where
the word "complaint" was scratched out and replaced with the word
"information."</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, McMahon said, an information is only filed after
a preliminary hearing has been held, not before.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a technicality," he told the justices.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz, a former Ventura resident, is accused of raping and
strangling a 44-year-old Port Hueneme woman in her home in 1993 and
setting the residence on fire to conceal the crime. He faces one
count of murder and two special-circumstance allegations that he
killed Cynthia Burger during a rape and burglary. Prosecutors are
seeking the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Given the potential punishment, defense lawyers say it is
incumbent upon the prosecution to follow the letter of the law.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are going to seek to execute somebody, you've got to
follow the rules of criminal procedure that have been in place for
150 years," McMahon said after the hearing. The justices are expected
to rule at a future date. Schultz remains in jail without bail.</TE>

<HD>Summer Sessions Growing at Colleges</HD>
<DH>Education: Weak job market, lower fees and more classes are
cited for the higher enrollment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON and STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enrollments in college summer sessions are up markedly at many
California campuses this year, the apparent result of a weak seasonal
job market, lower fees and a greater array of classes on campus.</LD>
<LD>   Higher enrollments from UC Berkeley to San Diego State are part of
a growing national trend toward greater summer session attendance,
several college officials said. The figures also reflect a cultural
shift as American colleges and universities move toward year-round
operations, a far cry from the sleepy summer campuses of years past.</LD>
<LD>   "Summer is increasingly seen as just another period of time on the
academic calendar," said Barmak Nassirian of the American Assn. of
Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers in Washington, D.C. "It
can be put to very good use academically."</LD>
<TE>   In California, state subsidies initiated in 2001 have
substantially reduced the cost of attending summer school at
University of California and California State University campuses. It
is part of a statewide effort to cope with a decade-long enrollment
surge as children of baby boomers head to college.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of building hundreds of new classrooms, officials say, the
idea is to make better use of existing facilities year-round, and
encourage students to speed their progress toward graduation.</TE>
<TE>   For UC and Cal State students, the subsidies mean that the basic
cost of taking summer classes, once significantly higher than during
the rest of the year, is now roughly the same. Visiting and
out-of-state students still pay more. Financial aid is also more
readily available now to summer students.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some campuses, including UCLA, UC Berkeley and most
Cal States, have received extra funding from the Legislature to offer
a broader array of summer classes.</TE>
<TE>   Across California, students have responded to the incentives,
fueling a second straight year of fast growth. At campuses that
already have taken a count of summer sign-ups, substantial increases
are almost universal this year. For the UC system's undergraduate
summer programs, estimated enrollment increases range from 12% to
38%.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Berkeley, where the first of several summer sessions started
May 28, student Katrina Kerr says going to school now will allow her
to complete a course required for her American Studies major. In the
past, such courses often were not available during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "The classes are smaller and more focused, and you get to know the
professors better," Kerr said. She said she also likes the
less-crowded campus.</TE>
<TE>   But that might change, as more and more college students see the
season as a time to study.</TE>
<TE>   "The state subsidies are working," said Gary Penders, director of
UC Berkeley's summer sessions, where enrollment is expected to be 15%
above last year. "Students understand that it's a good deal and a
good idea."</TE>
<TE>   Penders said students--and their parents--also may be influenced
by fears of a possible fee increase, although none is on the
immediate horizon. Given the California budget crisis, he speculated,
some students are trying to race through college to avoid the risk of
fees rising, as they did in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   He and others also said the soft summer job market appears to be
pushing many students toward summer classes.</TE>
<TE>   "When there aren't a lot of part-time jobs around, people come
back to school or stay in school--even in the summer," said David
Unruh, Penders' counterpart at UCLA. The Westwood campus is also
expecting at least 15% more students this summer than last.</TE>
<TE>   California community colleges did not receive extra funding from
the state for summer programs, spokeswoman Kirsten Macintyre said.
Even so, several campuses are reporting increased interest in summer
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   At the nine-campus Los Angeles Community College District,
officials said early summer school sign-ups appear to be running
ahead of last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Chancellor Marshall "Mark" Drummond said the district will
hold its enrollment to roughly the same total as last year, when it
had more than 54,000 students in its regular programs, by cutting
back classes.</TE>
<TE>   He said those cuts will be made to deal with a continuing budget
squeeze that has left the district without state funding for roughly
20,000 of its students this coming school year.</TE>
<TE>   "This summer, anyone who is coming better sign up early because if
they wait until the last minute, they're likely to find no classes
available or classes filled," Drummond said. "We're in a cost pinch."</TE>
<TE>   In the California State University system, summer enrollment
soared last year--rising about 40% from the level in 2000, to about
85,000--after the increased state funding allowed campuses to step up
offerings and cut student fees.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the 22-campus system expects a more moderate increase,
spokeswoman Colleen Bentley-Adler said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more of an incentive now to go in the summer,"
Bentley-Adler said. The classes "are just as cheap as they were in
spring and fall, and they're usually smaller classes. You can get
your general ed requirements out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Cal State campuses are offering many more summer
courses than before, she and others said. One of the biggest
expansions has come at San Francisco State, which is offering 1,300
courses this summer, up from 150 last year.</TE>
<TE>   At Cal State Northridge, where the first of three summer sessions
began June 3, a stream of students continued to register for courses
last week. Students on the campus, though, were divided on whether
they learn more in summer school.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Rendon, a broadcast journalism major, said the faster pace
of summer school forces him to be more disciplined. "There's no room
for error. There's no room to relax. It keeps you tuned in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Vadee Punyanussoranee, a 21-year-old who is taking classes
this summer at both College of the Canyons in Valencia and Cal State
Northridge, said instructors seem to cut corners during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   During the regular school year, Punyanussoranee said, "you learn
the whole thing. In the summer, you learn just the most important
things."</TE>
<TE>   In her Shakespeare class at College of the Canyons, she said, the
teacher had to limit discussion of "As You Like It"--to
Punyanussoranee's dismay.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have time to go into detail," she said.</TE>

<HD>Link Between Sewage, Surfer Health Is Studied</HD>
<DH>Probe: Ocean users in Huntington Beach tested for hepatitis
A. Sanitation district, which dumps waste there, says nothing can be
proved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Long Beach doctor, with the help of the Surfrider Foundation, is
conducting a study of Huntington Beach surfers to determine if
frequent ocean users there have a greater risk of contracting
hepatitis A, a virus that flourishes in polluted waters.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with Surfrider, an environmental group, said they hope
the research will add scientific muscle to their fight to stop the
Orange County Sanitation District's practice of releasing 245 million
gallons of treated sewage--half of which is processed below federal
standards--every day four miles off the Huntington Beach coast.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Aaron Gloskowski said no one has studied the potential for
illness from the sewage plume, adding "we really don't know yet"
whether the sewage has an adverse effect on ocean users' health.</LD>
<TE>   Nor will this study prove it, sanitation officials said. Even if
ocean users have higher rates of hepatitis A, that doesn't
necessarily mean the disease came from the sewage plume.</TE>
<TE>   Results of the research, which fulfills a requirement for
Gloskowski's third-year residency program at a Long Beach hospital,
will be announced within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The district is scheduled to decide this summer whether to seek
renewal of a federal waiver that allows it to treat half of the waste
water it pumps into the ocean at levels less than those adopted by
most of the nation's 16,000 sanitation districts. Its waiver expires
next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to get information that will help us prove to them
that their plan is really detrimental to the public," said Lisa
Brooks, chairwoman of Surfrider Foundation's Huntington Beach/Seal
Beach chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "They always say [the sewage] is out far enough that it's not
hurting anyone. But for a long time, people have told us they are
getting sick."</TE>
<TE>   The state Assembly last month passed a bill that would block the
district from getting the federal standards waived. The proposal is
being debated by state senators.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Huntington Beach coastline has been plagued
by high bacteria counts caused by sewage. A $5- million sanitation
district study released last month did not find a definitive source
for the high bacteria levels.</TE>
<TE>   District spokeswoman Sonja Wassgren said that even if surfers have
contracted the hepatitis virus, it's impossible to identify the
source: urban runoff, a nearby marsh, leaky sewer pipes or the
district's offshore sewage plume.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty hard to quantify," Wassgren said.</TE>

<TE>   A member of the Surfrider Foundation, he had often heard about the
nonprofit's efforts to determine the effects of polluted water on
surfers' health. And that seemed a perfect subject for his final
research study required as a resident doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, 40 surfers, most still wet from the ocean, had their
blood drawn at the Huntington Beach Pier to see if they were more
likely to have hepatitis A antibodies than a control group of
landlubbers.</TE>
<TE>   The virus, found in fecal matter, produces flu-like symptoms and
often goes undiagnosed. That makes it difficult for clean-water
advocates like Surfrider to link pollution to health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, surveys taken at the beach or in surf shops along with
anecdotal evidence were the primary methods Surfrider and others used
to track ocean-related illnesses.</TE>

<HD>Democrats See Need for More Tax Increases</HD>
<DH>Budget: They believe Davis has underfunded essential
services and are looking at options to increase revenue. GOP
advocates spending cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The prospect of tax increases even heftier and more prolonged than
those proposed by Gov. Gray Davis is taking hold here as lawmakers
press forward with a compromise budget that is hundreds of millions
of dollars out of balance.</LD>
<LD>   To help close the state's $23.6-billion budget gap, Davis proposed
a nearly $100-billion spending plan for the 2002-03 fiscal year that
includes $3.5 billion in tax hikes--primarily increases in the
cigarette tax and vehicle license fees--and other new revenue.</LD>
<LD>   But the compromise plan being negotiated by a legislative
conference committee has been running $500 million to $1 billion or
more out of balance. One reason is that the committee has restored
some of the cuts proposed by Davis, including its decision Thursday
night to keep open five private prisons at a cost of $2.8 million.</LD>
<TE>   To close the gap, lawmakers will either need to cut spending,
borrow money or raise revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Budget Committee Chairwoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach)
said Friday there is no question in her mind that new revenue will
need to exceed the $3.5 billion sought by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Oropeza and other legislative Democrats believe the governor has
underfunded essential services, and she is not comfortable with his
proposed level of spending. She cited as options raising sales or
personal income taxes or suspending certain tax credits or the
vehicle license rebate.</TE>
<TE>   "We need additional revenues," she said. "This budget cuts too
deep into services and programs Californians have come to rely upon."</TE>
<TE>   At stake, Oropeza said, are recent gains made in health care,
education and trauma care. "We can't just go backward," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of 100 groups supporting a proposal by Senate Leader
John Burton (D-San Francisco) to reinstate top income-tax brackets
has planned a news conference for Monday. Health-care advocates and
other lobbyists for the poor have joined a growing number of
Democratic lawmakers in backing the Burton plan, which is opposed by
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "The Assembly Democrats have not wanted to cut anything and, in
fact, they continue to want to expand programs," said Sen. Dick
Ackerman (R-Irvine), who over the last two weeks has voted to support
more than $4 billion worth of cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republicans held a news conference last week to blast
Davis' tax plan and featured a 1969 Buick Wildcat as a prop; it's the
only model of car California families will be able to afford if
vehicle license fees are allowed to rise, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The dueling approaches contributed to lawmakers missing today's
deadline for approving the budget with a two-thirds vote in both the
Assembly and Senate and sending it to Davis to sign by the July 1
start of the new fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations on a compromise spending planmay resume today.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday afternoon, the plan was running $685 million above
the Davis spending proposal, which includes a $516-million reserve.
The state's independent legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, also has
warned that lawmakers need to find $600 million more to cover an
accounting change.</TE>
<TE>   While it's unclear how the committee will decide to balance the
budget, so far Democrats have balked at the deep spending cuts sought
by Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   After weighing nearly $6 billion in cost-saving options floated by
Hill's office and another $1 billion or more proposed by Ackerman,
the committee signed off on about $600 million in savings. Half of
the amount stems from the Davis administration agreeing to an
Ackerman proposal to eliminate 6,000 vacant positions in state
government.</TE>
<TE>   The debate illuminated philosophical differences between Democrats
and Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) took issue with
Ackerman's proposal to suspend state funding on cancer research to
save $13 million, for example. Steinberg warned the committee against
considering the proposal in a vacuum, noting that Davis had already
proposed reducing about half the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman agreed with Steinberg that a broader set of factors
should be taken into consideration. He then pointed out that the
federal government spends hundreds of millions of dollars funding
cancer research.</TE>
<TE>   "Cancer research is very important, but it's going to go on
whether we take the cut or not," Ackerman said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee rejected the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman also proposed eliminating $600,000 for the University of
California's Institute for Global Conflict and Cooperation. An
eagle-eyed GOP fiscal consultant noted in an analysis that "this
program has been ineffective at maintaining peace and cooperation in
the world."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if we upped the investment we'd have a better result,"
Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "Which one of your programs do you want me to take that money out
of?" Ackerman replied.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the committee approved new spending and restored
cuts that total hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, the
committee approved $2.8 million to continue operating five private
prisons for another year. Davis recommended closing all five prisons
in his January budget proposal and agreed recently to keep one of
them open.</TE>
<TE>   Byron Tucker, a deputy press secretary for Davis, said the
governor continues to believe there is no reason to keep the other
four prisons open, and noted that the budget is not yet complete.
(Plans for a new prison in the Central Valley town of Delano also
remain on course after lawmakers approved funding for the project.)</TE>
<TE>   Republicans voted against a successful bid to expand a health
insurance program for poor children to include their parents at a
cost of $50 million. But they joined Democrats in restoring $111
million for a juvenile crime prevention program, $38 million to help
cities pay for booking suspects into county jails and $39 million for
a tax program favored by environmentalists and rural communities that
rewards landowners for keeping their land undeveloped.</TE>

<HD>Writing the Book on the Torah From a Female Perspective</HD>
<DH>Scholarship: A professor is heading an ambitious commentary
on little-known roles of women in biblical times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To explain the significance of the new Torah commentary she is
working on, Bible professor Tamara Cohn Eskenazi invokes the tale of
Zelophehad's daughters.</LD>
<LD>   The reference draws a blank stare--which is precisely what
motivates her.</LD>
<LD>   The story of Zelophehad's daughters is a tale of five sisters who
won the right--previously limited to men--to inherit their father's
land. They accomplished the rare feat of convincing God to create a
new law, yet their triumph is relegated to the margins of Torah
editions.</LD>
<TE>   For Eskenazi and other feminist Bible scholars, the scant
attention paid to Zelophehad's daughters illustrates how women have
been overlooked by male-authored commentaries on the Torah.</TE>
<TE>   So, like the five sisters who challenged tradition and won a more
just system for all, a group of female scholars headed by Eskenazi
plans to rewrite the book, so to speak, on the Torah.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next five years, the women plan to compile a commentary
on the Torah--the first five books of the Old Testament Bible--that
will highlight female figures.</TE>
<TE>   Eskenazi, a Bible professor at Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion in Los Angeles, is editing the commentary. She
says the writers will challenge centuries of male-dominated Torah
interpretations, but in traditional form.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, the Torah has been printed with the biblical
passage in the center of a page, surrounded by interpretations from
commentators of different eras and viewpoints. The women's commentary
will employ that layout, but all commentators will be female.</TE>
<TE>   The commentary project is sponsored by Women of Reform Judaism-the
Federation of Temple Sisterhoods, a group representing more than 600
temple women's groups in 15 countries.</TE>
<TE>   It was commissioned because the group believes male scholars have
missed the richness and subtlety of women's roles in the Bible,
including the complexity of family relationships in Bible stories and
the heroic acts of women in the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision came from a community of women who said we want our
Torah, a commentary that speaks to us," Eskenazi said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Zelophehad's daughters, for example, Eskenazi said
the prevalent Torah commentary used in Reform congregations today
deals with the story in "four or five lines. We will spend four pages
on it."</TE>
<TE>   Another woman in the Bible often overlooked, Eskenazi said, is the
prophet Huldah. It was on Huldah's authority that the book of
Deuteronomy was recognized as the word of God in the 7th century BC.
"No other prophet aside from Moses was as successful, yet most
contemporary readers are not even aware of her story," Eskenazi said.</TE>
<TE>   Huldah's story would appeal to a contemporary audience for another
reason, the scholar said. While Huldah was a revered prophet, her
husband, Shallum, was keeper of the King's wardrobe. Eskenazi sees
their story as "a wonderful example of two professional people and
how they divide their roles. She's a public figure, he takes care of
the clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Examples From Exodus</TE>
<TE>   She also cites the women in Exodus as characters who deserve more
attention and are especially relevant to women today. "When Miriam
and the daughter of Pharaoh rescue Moses together, they cross
religious, national and class boundaries, all for the sake of life,"
she said. Their act is also an example of nonviolent resistance to
tyranny, she said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been previous women's commentaries on the Torah, but
Eskenazi said those works analyzed selected passages; this work, she
said, will go through the entire Torah paragraph by paragraph.</TE>
<TE>   She said the new commentary will also include literary criticism,
sociology and history in its examination of the text. Letters were
sent this month to 100 scholars inviting them to submit material for
the commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Such an ambitious undertaking is possible because there is finally
a "critical mass" of Jewish female biblical scholars and rabbis to
draw upon. Though contributors have decades of experience, "almost
everyone is a pioneer. In fact, almost everyone is a 'first' in her
field," Eskenazi said.</TE>
<TE>   Eskenazi was the first woman appointed to the rabbinical faculty
at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, in 1990. Her
own story reflects the difficult balancing act maintained by many
women in her generation.</TE>
<TE>   She emigrated from Israel to New York as a teenager, then left
architecture school after one year to get married. She was widowed
shortly after that, remarried, and moved to Denver with her second
husband. While raising five children, she took college classes in her
free time, finishing her bachelor's degree in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   During those years as a full-time mother and part-time student,
Eskenazi, who grew up in a mildly religious household, sharpened her
academic interest in the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "Raising my children, I needed access to wisdom, and how-to books
did not do it for me. I needed the depth of wisdom accumulated over
centuries," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When her children were grown, Eskenazi entered graduate school,
and got her PhD "two years before my daughter got hers."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the professor who once sought wisdom from the Bible to
guide her through parenthood hopes to create a work that will allow
the work of women to inspire others.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bible is full of strong, exciting women who have been
relegated to the shadows, either by the Bible itself or by later
interpreters. Our commentary will bring them out of the shadows into
the limelight where they belong."</TE>

<LD>The FBI on Friday added to its 10 most-wanted list a Long Beach man
wanted on suspicion of molesting six girls under the age of 13.</LD>
<LD>   From January through May 2001, Richard Steve Goldberg, 56, is
suspected of luring the girls to his home in the north Long Beach
area, gaining their trust by allowing them to play with his pets and
computers, and then committing sex acts with them. Sometimes,
authorities said, he took the girls on short trips.</LD>
<LD>   He also allegedly kept computer images showing him having sex with
the girls.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Garcia, special agent in charge of the criminal branch in
the Los Angeles FBI office, said that Goldberg, an aerospace
engineer, has fled to escape prosecution and is believed to have
visited relatives in New Jersey and traveled elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   He should be considered armed and dangerous, Garcia said, and
people sighting him should notify authorities, not try to apprehend
him themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and Long Beach police released two photos of Goldberg, who
has black hair and brown eyes, is 6 feet tall, weighs about 160
pounds, wears a mustache and has distinctive facial features they
believe render him quite recognizable.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said 474 names have been on the most-wanted list since the
FBI originated it in 1950, and 445 of those people have been
arrested. Others died or were taken off the list for various reasons.</TE>
<TE>   California authorities issued an arrest warrant for Goldberg last
July.</TE>
<TE>   A reward of $50,000 has also been offered for information leading
to the fugitive's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said Goldberg is believed to be skilled in the use of
weapons and noted that while working for a major aerospace firm in
the Long Beach area, he was president of a gun club there.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Friday ruled that a Santa
Clarita water wholesaler's arrangement for selling water on the
retail market violates state law and must stop.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes three years after the Castaic Lake Water
Agency, a public entity that sells imported water, paid $63 million
for the Santa Clarita Water Co., a private company that sold water to
customers in parts of northern Los Angeles County. After the
purchase, Castaic Lake Water began selling water directly to
households and businesses in the Saugus and Canyon Country
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Some residents strongly opposed the purchase, saying it drove
water rates up and gave too much power to a single entity. They filed
a lawsuit, saying the sale was illegal.</LD>
<TE>   In his ruling, Judge David Yaffe said the arrangement as it
currently exists violates the state law. He gave the agency until
September to stop selling water on the retail market.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling will eventually lead to lower water bills for some
residents, said Lynne Plambeck, one of the four residents who brought
the lawsuit against the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "This means there's less chance of a water monopoly in the Santa
Clarita Valley, and that the water company's customers have more
oversight over their company," Plambeck said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for Castaic Lake Water said in a statement that Yaffe
"ignored the intent" of a state law, created last year, that they
said broadens their ability to act as a retailer and allows them to
sell water directly to some local households and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The agency and the plaintiffs disagreed, however, on whether the
law allows the agency to continue selling water through Santa Clarita
Water Co.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs originally lost their case in trial court, but an
appeals court reinstated the suit last July.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the agency said they may appeal Friday's decision.</TE>

<HD>Ryder Pleads Not Guilty to Charges</HD>
<DH>Courts: The actress is accused of shoplifting at Saks Fifth
Avenue and of drug possession.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Winona Ryder pleaded not guilty to shoplifting and drug
charges Friday during a brief appearance at a Beverly Hills
courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   Her arraignment came the week after Superior Court Judge Elden S.
Fox ruled that there was enough evidence for Ryder to stand trial on
felony charges of grand theft, burglary, vandalism and possession of
drugs without a prescription.</LD>
<LD>   The star of "Little Women" and "The Age of Innocence" is accused
of shoplifting $4,760 worth of merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue in
Beverly Hills in December.</LD>
<TE>   Ryder's attorney, Mark Geragos, also said Friday that he planned
to proceed with his efforts to have the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office disqualified from the case. He said in an earlier
court hearing that he believed the office had an "ax to grind" with
his client.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have filed a notice that they plan to introduce
evidence of "the defendant's commission of other acts" in connection
with the case, but they have declined to explain. Records show that
Ryder does not have any prior convictions. Fox ordered that any
motions on that issue be filed under seal.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's next scheduled court hearing is a pretrial conference July
15 in Fox's courtroom. The actress is not required to attend.</TE>

<HD>21,600 Acres Later, Wildfire Near Ojai Totally Contained</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly two weeks after it began and burned almost 22,000 acres of
brittle chaparral and pine in the Ventura County back country, the
Wolf fire was declared totally contained Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   At 6 p.m., federal fire officials announced they had a protection
line dug around the entire 21,645-acre fire and that mop-up efforts
to stomp out any remaining hot spots had begun.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a big fire and a major suppression effort, but that's our
job," said Joe Pasinato, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. "But
everybody is happy we are seeing some closure, specifically the
residents who live in communities around it."</LD>
<TE>   At its peak last week, more than 1,500 county, state and federal
firefighters were battling the blaze in Los Padres National Forest,
just north of Ojai. By Friday night, that number had been reduced to
about 300.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen fixed-wing aircraft that had been used to drop fire
retardant were released from service, but three helicopters were
going to be used over the weekend to patrol the burned area and douse
any flare-ups.</TE>
<TE>   At Soule Park in Ojai, firefighters from dozens of public safety
agencies were breaking camp, folding up tents and packing trailers in
the mini-city that had served as the command center since the blaze
started June 1.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the Wolf fire--so named because it started near
Wolf's Grill on Highway 33--remains under investigation, but
authorities are looking into whether people shooting guns near the
restaurant may have sparked the blaze.</TE>

School's Class of 1942, are honored.</DH>

<LD>It took Yoshie Fujita Hagiya 60 years to find out she was
valedictorian of her high school class.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday those decades of wondering culminated in one dramatic
moment, as Hagiya took to the graduation podium and, at age 77,
finally said her peace.</LD>
<LD>   "We are nearing the end of a road that has come with many twists
and turns, but now we can see the sunlight at the end," said Hagiya,
one of five members of Oxnard High School's Class of 1942 honored at
the school's graduation ceremony Friday. The Japanese Americans
missed out on their commencement six decades ago when World War II
forced them from their homes and into an Arizona internment camp.</LD>
<TE>   "We look back not in anger," Hagiya said, "but with gratitude for
all the unexpected joys."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing black caps and gowns, the Class of 1942 stood on stage
before 550 members of Oxnard High's Class of 2002 and a stadium
packed with cheering friends and family members.</TE>
<TE>   As their names were called by former Oxnard mayor and assemblyman
Nao Takasugi--himself a camp survivor--applause erupted. Some in the
crowd stood.</TE>
<TE>   The elder graduates, silver hair poking from under their
mortarboards, shook hands with school district dignitaries and picked
up copies of their diplomas, just as they would have as teenagers 60
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   They have survived wars. Retired from productive careers.</TE>
<TE>   Their children have children of their own.</TE>
<TE>   But those who were honored Friday said it wasn't too late.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect anything like this," said 78-year-old Yori
Kanamori, who still lives in Oxnard. "I feel really honored and happy
about the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Matsumiya, 79, said he still feels some residual bitterness
about what happened to local residents of Japanese ancestry during
the war, many of whom were U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "We were put behind barbed wire. We didn't commit any crime," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although claiming his diploma did not completely undo that damage,
Matsumiya said, "It does help make up for what was taken from us."</TE>
<TE>   Also receiving her diploma was Yoshiko Inouye Mato. There were 11
seniors of Japanese ancestry from Oxnard High interned that year,
school officials say. At least one has died, and the other five could
not be found or could not make it to the ceremony Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1942, by order of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, 120,000 Japanese Americans from Washington to Arizona left
their homes and businesses, selling or giving away most of their
belongings. Escorted by armed soldiers, they were sent to 10
internment camps scattered across the West.</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard High and in hundreds of high school classrooms along the
West Coast, students of Japanese ancestry were there one day and gone
the next.</TE>
<TE>   Lois Booth Argend remembers it well. Hagiya was one of her best
friends, who taught Argend how to write her name in Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   "When they left it was so all-of-a-sudden," Argend said. "It was a
very sad time."</TE>
<TE>   She read about Friday's recognition ceremony in a news article,
and wanted to be there to support her old friend.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very deserving of this," Argend said, "and it's about time
she's recognized."</TE>
<TE>   Hagiya didn't learn until last month that she had the highest
grades in the Class of 1942, after school officials uncovered the
records. It's something Hagiya wondered about off and on over the
years, but the 60th anniversary of her lost graduation prompted her
to find out once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   Hagiya's request coincided with a wish Oxnard High Assistant
Principal Gary Mayeda had since being hired three years ago: to hand
a diploma to his 79-year-old father, Seiichi Charles Mayeda, who was
also a member of the Class of 1942.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this provides you with resolution, clarity or closure,"
Gary Mayeda said to his father and the other four graduates at the
ceremony. "Thank you for the significant contributions you have made,
to society and to history."</TE>
<TE>   Since the late 1980s, high schools and colleges throughout the
West have been trying to make reparation to those students who were
denied diplomas in 1942. Dozens of them have been honored, from Santa
Clara to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Delaine Eastin, state superintendent for public instruction,
commended Oxnard High, and urged all schools that have not yet
honored their forgotten graduates to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Takasugi, standing near Hagiya's 13-year-old grandson, Tyler,
said the commencement exercises are equally important for the
graduates' younger family members.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to teach our children that such a thing happened," she
said. "And that it should never happen again."</TE>
